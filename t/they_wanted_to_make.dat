5|$|Hugo Weaving, who {{portrayed the}} Red Skull, wore a latex mask {{conceived}} by prosthetic makeup designer David White. The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably, as the mask was bulky and <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{it look like}} tight skin wrapped around a very bony structure. They thinned out Weaving's cheeks and lower lip, hollowed out his eyes, and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear more like the Red Skull character.|$|E
5|$|Capcom began {{development}} knowing <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a survival horror {{game with a}} lead female character. Believing that the female lead would not bode well with retailers and players alike, they added in a dog partner that could attack enemies. After this change, they further designed the gameplay around this partner mechanic. The cinematics were directed by actor and director, Naoto Takenaka. He directly supervised the motion capture performances used for all the characters, placing emphasis on dramatic performance. Takenaka played the motion capture role for Riccardo, and Japanese actors Yasue Sato and Jiro Sato played Fiona and Debilitas respectively. Rather than streaming audio files, the music for Haunting Ground was generated by using the PS2's built-in sounds. This way, the composers could easily change the tempo of the music during gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Allan Arkush and Kring {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} on The Post Show that many parts of the finale were re-shot due to the Writers' Strike. Kring and Arkush commented that they re-shot the scene in which Peter telekenetically caught the virus. In the original cut, the virus was to shatter and be released. Kring admitted that the virus being released was to play a huge role in Volume 3, however, they decided to go into a different direction and re-shoot the ending, allowing Peter to catch the virus and destroy it. Kring also commented that the scenes where Matt, Peter and Nathan were talking in the vault were rewritten in and added later, as well as the Press Conference scene and the scene with Angela Petrelli talking on the cell phone. Kring and Arkush stated that the ending had to be rewritten and re-shot because they did not know when the show would return to air, due to the Writer's Strike, and <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that they tied up all the loose ends.|$|E

In The Making of in America, a featurette on the DVD release of the film, Sheridan explains Christy and Ariel are based on his daughters (and co-writers) Naomi and Kirsten. He says <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a film showing how people can learn to overcome their pain and live for the future instead of dwelling on the sadness of the past.|$|E

Manoah did not {{recognize}} that he was an angel, and asked him for his name so that when his prophecy proved true, they could honor him.

25|$|A {{canceled}} CGI-animated film titled Hugo and the Diamond Moon {{was planned}} in 1999 {{to be released}} {{at the end of}} 2002. Its budget was set at around 100 million DKK which at that time amounted to $12–20 million. It was written and expected to be directed by the Disney and Pixar veteran animator and musician Jørgen Klubien, and was storyboarded with over 8,000 sketches by Frank Madsen, Jørgen Klubien, Mike Cachuela and Mads Themberg.

25|$|Another famous dish, chiles en nogada, {{was also}} {{supposedly}} invented here. The story begins with three sisters from Puebla who met officers from Agustin de Iturbide’s Army of the Three Guarantees in Mexico City {{and fell in}} love with them. Attempts were made to engage the couples but one problem was that none of the sisters knew how to cook. Upon returning to Puebla, their mother sent them to the Convent of Santa Monica to learn. The women decided <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an original dish to impress Iturbide and his officers when they were due to visit Puebla. The dish, chiles en nogada, represents the colors of the Mexican flag, green (parsley), white (the walnut sauce) and red (pomegranate seeds). The dish was served for the first time at a banquet for Iturbide with great success.|$|E

500|$|Written by Lauren Faust and Tim McKeon, [...] "Destination: Imagination" [...] was {{directed}} by Rob Renzetti and series creator Craig McCracken. The plot was conceived after the crew decided that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an episode with adventure, featuring the characters {{going out on a}} large quest of sorts.

500|$|Cooney's study, titled [...] "Television for Preschool Education", {{spelled out}} how {{television}} {{could be used}} to help young children, especially from low-income families, prepare for school. [...] The focus on the new show was on children from disadvantaged backgrounds, but Cooney and the show's creators recognized that in order to achieve the kind of success they wanted, it had to be equally accessible to children of all socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds. [...] At the same time, <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the show so appealing to inner-city children that it would help them learn as much as children with more educational opportunities.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by the series' co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone.

Heavily influenced by the Peanuts Christmas special A Charlie Brown Christmas from 1965, [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] was the first Christmas-themed South Park episode, the first musical episode, and the only episode in season one (and therefore {{the first time in the}} series) in which Kenny does not die.
