During the Thirty-first Congress, the Whig caucus {{considered}} {{him as a}} candidate for Speaker of the House. The voting for speaker began December 3, 1849. The caucus first chose Robert C. Winthrop as <b>their</b> <b>candidate,</b> but after several ballots, Winthrop was still unable to obtain a majority because of sectional rivalries within the caucus. Some Whigs from northern states voted for David Wilmot, a Free Soiler, while five southern Whigs steadfastly voted for Meredith Gentry. The Democrats were similarly unable to muster a majority for <b>their</b> <b>candidate,</b> Howell Cobb.|$|E
5|$|Delegates to the 1887 state Democratic {{convention}} nominated Buckner unanimously for {{the office}} of governor. A week later, the Republicans chose William O.

5|$|In 1944, {{even though}} a {{prisoner}} of war, Hinton was contacted by the International Red Cross to pass on a request from the Labour Party. It asked him to consider standing as <b>their</b> <b>candidate</b> in a by-election in Awarua. He had previously signaled his interest in pursuing a career in politics. However, {{he was unable to}} confirm his candidacy in time.|$|E
5|$|In March 1979 James Callaghan's Labour {{government}} fell, and {{a general}} election was called for 3 May. This led to a brief delay in {{the start of the}} trial as Thorpe, who still had a following among North Devon Liberals, was adopted as <b>their</b> <b>candidate</b> in the election. Largely isolated from his party's national campaign, he lost the seat to his Conservative opponent by over 8,000 votes.|$|E

Before the election he {{had joined the}} Labour Party and had been welcomed by the local constituency party as <b>their</b> <b>candidate.</b> He was thus one of the 393 Labour MPs in the landslide election victory that replaced Churchill as prime minister with Clement Attlee.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 2016, a {{referendum}} {{was held on}} the question of whether Morales should be allowed to run for a fourth term when his third term would expire in 2020 which he narrowly lost. His approval rating had been damaged by the allegations concerning his relationship with Gabriela Zapata Montaño. In December 2016 the MAS nominated Morales as <b>their</b> <b>candidate</b> for the 2019 presidential election regardless, stating that they would seek various avenues to ensure that this would be legal.|$|E

5|$|After {{service in}} World War I and {{a law degree}} from Yale, Dilworth practiced law in Philadelphia. He and Clark were allies in the anti-corruption reform effort that had swept the city four years earlier. Dilworth had run for mayor unsuccessfully in 1947, with Clark as his {{campaign}} manager. In 1949, he was elected City Treasurer. He resigned that post to run for governor in 1950, but was defeated by Republican John S. Fine. Democratic party leaders had intended Dilworth to be <b>their</b> <b>candidate</b> for mayor again in 1951, but when Clark announced his candidacy, Dilworth agreed to run for district attorney instead. He won, taking just shy of 58% of the vote. In the primary election in May, Dilworth easily defeated his underfunded opponent, William A. Paschall, a local meat dealer.|$|E
5|$|Breathitt {{was elected}} to {{represent}} Logan County in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1811, and was re-elected every year until 1815. In the gubernatorial election of 1828, the Democrats chose William T. Barry as <b>their</b> <b>candidate</b> for governor. Initially, they offered the nomination for lieutenant governor to Judge John P. Oldham, but Oldham declined, and Breathitt was chosen as his replacement. Barry lost the governorship to National Republican Thomas Metcalfe, but Breathitt defeated Metcalfe's running mate Joseph R. Underwood by more than 1,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} President Grant ran for reelection in 1872, Grant's {{administration}} had been rocked by scandal, and some disaffected {{members of his}} party formed the Liberal Republicans, naming Greeley as <b>their</b> <b>candidate</b> for president, a nomination soon joined in by the Democrats. Hay was unenthusiastic about the editor-turned-candidate, and in his editorials mostly took aim at Grant, who, despite the scandals, remained untarred, and who won a landslide victory in the election. Greeley died only weeks later, a broken man. Hay's stance endangered his hitherto sterling credentials in the Republican Party.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his growing}} {{national}} fame, Dow continued to face opposition at home. Both Dow and his opponents engaged in anonymous newspaper campaigns against the other, often making personal attacks alongside political arguments. For the 1852 municipal election, the Democrats nominated Albion Parris, {{a former governor}} and United States Senator, to run against Dow. While the Democrats rallied behind <b>their</b> <b>candidate,</b> Dow's vigorous enforcement of prohibition divided his party, and in two wards the Whigs ran an anti-Dow ticket instead. On election day, Dow slightly increased his vote total from the year before, with 1496, but Parris outpolled him, bringing in 1900 votes. Although the Whigs controlled voter registration at the time, Dow blamed his loss on illegal voting by Irish immigrants.|$|E
5|$|In the 2009 provincial election, {{the party}} {{nominated}} candidates in three ridings.

In Vancouver-Hastings, The Sex Party candidate was Dietrich Pajonk. He came in last with 99 votes (0.51%), losing to the incumbent NDP candidate Shane Simpson. In Vancouver-West End, <b>their</b> <b>candidate</b> was the operator of an escort business, Scarlett Lake, who received 90 votes (0.51%), losing to the NDP candidate Spencer Chandra Herbert.|$|E
5|$|In the gubernatorial {{election}} of 1911, Republicans were divided {{as to whether}} they should celebrate Willson's administration or downplay it. His actions to quell the violence in the Black Patch Wars and his pardons to Taylor and Powers were both unpopular with many voters. The eventual candidate, Edward C. O'Rear, was lukewarm at best to Willson's administration. Willson was upset by this hesitancy and lent O'Rear only modest support on the campaign trail. Former governor Bradley also disagreed with O'Rear's selection and engaged in minimal campaigning. The failure of the party to unite behind <b>their</b> <b>candidate</b> gave Democrat James B. McCreary an easy victory.|$|E

The Democratic chairpersons met with all six candidates at a diner in Albany on February 1, and selected Scott Murphy of Glens Falls, president of the Upstate Venture Association of New York, as <b>their</b> <b>candidate.</b> Other confirmed candidates included Saratoga County Democratic Chairman Larry Bulman, former New York Rangers goaltender Mike Richter, Coxsackie Town Supervisor Alex Betke, and Tracey Brooks, failed candidate for the nomination for the 21st district election in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia's {{municipal}} election of November 5, 1957, involved {{the election of}} the district attorney, city controller, and the remainder of a term for one city council seat, as well as several row offices and judgeships. Democrats were successful citywide, continuing a run of victories racked up after the passage of a new city charter in 1951 despite growing divisions between factions of the party. Victor H. Blanc, the incumbent district attorney, led the Democratic ticket to victory. They held the city council seat and took two citywide offices that Republicans had won in 1953. In the judges' elections, most were endorsed by both parties but in the one race that pitted a Democratic candidate against a Republican, the Democrats were successful in seating <b>their</b> <b>candidate,</b> former Congressman Earl Chudoff.|$|E
5|$|The Presbyterian {{majority}} {{was quickly}} {{demonstrated by the}} election of <b>their</b> <b>candidate</b> the Duke of Hamilton as President of the Convention. On 12th March, James landed in Ireland and on 16th March, his Letter to the Convention was read out, demanding obedience and threatening punishment {{for those who did}} not comply. Public anger at the Letter's uncompromising tone meant some Episcopalians stopped attending the Convention, claiming to fear for their safety while others changed sides. Tensions were high, with Edinburgh Castle held by the Duke of Gordon, Dundee recruiting Highland levies for James and fears of an Irish invasion. These factors exaggerated the Presbyterian majority in the Convention which now met behind closed doors guarded by its own troops.|$|E
