5|$|Special {{consideration}} {{was given}} during filming {{to allow for}} integration of the planned special effects. <b>Television</b> <b>monitors</b> standing in for computer displays were specially calibrated so that their refresh rate {{did not result in}} banding on film. Due to a loss of resolution and quality resulting from rephotographing an element in an optical printer, live action sequences for effects were shot in 65mm or VistaVision formats to compensate. When the larger prints were reduced through an anamorphic lens on the printer, the result was a Panavision composite.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Sonic games, Sonic 3 uses rings, {{scattered throughout the}} levels, as a health system; when the player is attacked without rings, is crushed, falls off-screen, drowns, or exceeds the act's ten-minute limit, they lose a life {{and return to the}} most recently passed checkpoint. Dying with zero lives gives the player a game over. The levels also include power-ups in <b>television</b> <b>monitors</b> that, when hit, grant the character an extra life, temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings, a shield that allows them to breathe underwater, a shield that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby rings.|$|E

5|$|Various {{technological}} and aesthetic {{changes have been}} made to the Jeopardy! set over the years. The original game board was exposed from behind a curtain and featured clues printed on cardboard pull cards which were revealed as contestants selected them. The All-New Jeopardy!s game board was exposed from behind double-slide panels and featured flipping panels with the dollar amount {{on one side and the}} clue on the other. When the Trebek version premiered in 1984, the game board used individual <b>television</b> <b>monitors</b> for each clue within categories. The original monitors were replaced with larger and sleeker ones in 1991. In 2006, these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection video wall, which was replaced in 2009 with 36 high-definition flat-panel monitors manufactured by Sony Electronics.|$|E
5|$|In January 1944, workers {{laid the}} {{foundations}} for the first chemical separation building, T Plant located in 200-West. Both the T Plant and its sister facility in 200-West, the U Plant, were completed by October. (U Plant was used only for training during the Manhattan Project.) The separation building in 200-East, B Plant, was completed in February 1945. The second facility planned for 200-East was canceled. Nicknamed Queen Marys by the workers who built them, the separation buildings were awesome canyon-like structures 800 feet long, 65 feet wide, and 80 feet high containing forty process pools. The interior had an eerie quality as operators behind seven feet of concrete shielding manipulated remote control equipment by looking through <b>television</b> <b>monitors</b> and periscopes from an upper gallery. Even with massive concrete lids on the process pools, precautions against radiation exposure were necessary and influenced all aspects of plant design.|$|E

25|$|The Chelsea {{version was}} marked by a unique {{production}} style. Eugene Lee helped Prince {{make sure that the}} multi-scene show would not get bogged down in set changes - he created platforms for the action that allowed scenes to change by refocusing attention instead of changing scenery. Actors performed on platforms in front, behind, and sometimes between audience members. Some sat on bleachers, others on stools on the stage floor. As the story unfolded, so did the stage, with sections falling from above, opening, closing, flying apart or coming together. A 13-member orchestra played from four areas. The conductor, who wore period costume and gold braid, could be seen by audience and musicians alike on <b>television</b> <b>monitors.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of the {{nighttime}} syndicated version of Wheel which had premiered in 1983, Griffin sold a new syndicated version of Jeopardy!, hosted by Canadian-born TV personality Alex Trebek, to its same distributor, King World Productions (which much later folded into CBS Television Distribution). The Trebek version officially premiered on September 10, 1984, and introduced updated technology to the program, replacing the former manually operated game board featuring clues printed on pull cards with <b>television</b> <b>monitors</b> to display clues. The main difference from the 1964–75 versions was that only the winning contestant kept his or her earnings, while the runners-up were awarded higher-end consolation prizes instead (changed in later years to $2,000 for second place and $1,000 for third).|$|E
25|$|Rounding a {{bend and}} nearing the East River, the tram {{encountered}} Kong {{hanging from the}} Queensboro Bridge. A police helicopter hovering nearby opened fire on Kong to protect the approaching tram. Kong retaliated, pounding the roof of tram and sending the chopper crashing and exploding into the bridge. Narrowly escaping the attack, the tram finally crossed over the river to Roosevelt Island. A second helicopter hovering nearby shone a bright searchlight directly at the tram, inhibiting the view of what lay ahead. The tram operator urged the chopper {{to turn off the}} light, and in doing so, revealed that Kong had cut the tram off. He proceeded to grab, lift and subsequently drop the tram after being fired upon by the circling police helicopter. After narrowly escaping the enraged beast for a second time, small <b>television</b> <b>monitors</b> lowered from the tram's ceiling and guests watched themselves on the ride as part of a breaking news report as the tram safely made its way into the Roosevelt Island station. Although Kong was never actually defeated, the news report indicated that he was making his way away from New York City, thereby alleviating the threat.|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of many persons viewing {{the same field}} together has been long desired in urological endoscopy, not only for objective diagnosis and proper treatment but also as an aid in teaching. Since 1978, the authors have been using the video-system consisting of an MK- 309 C as a video-camera with a <b>television</b> <b>monitor,</b> the connecting scope between the endoscope and the video-camera, and a CLX as a light source. This system {{has been used in}} cystourethroscopy, TUR and fiberscopy of the upper urinary tract by our pyeloureteroscope. The features of this system are to use the connecting scope which allows <b>television</b> <b>monitoring</b> of the findings without disturbing the handling of the endoscope by the operator, the three-tube video-camera which transmits the pictures in quite natural color and good resolution to the <b>television</b> <b>monitor</b> and the very bright light source which gives clear views of the lesions.

500|$|The {{characters}} and acting received a mixed reception. Stephen Godfrey of The Globe and Mail rated their performances highly: [...] "time has cemented Leonard Nimoy's look of inscrutability as Mr. Spock [...] DeForest Kelley as Dr. McCoy is as feisty as ever, and James Doohan as Scotty still splutters about his engineering woes. At a basic level, their exchanges {{are those of}} an odd assortment of grumpy, middle-aged men bickering about office politics. They are a relief from the stars, and a delight." [...] Godfrey's only concern was that the reunion of the old cast threatened to make casual viewers who had never seen Star Trek feel like uninvited guests. Martin considered the characters more likable than those in comparable science fiction films. Conversely, Arnold felt that the acting of the main cast (Shatner in particular) was poor; [...] "Shatner portrays Kirk as such a supercilious old twit that one rather wishes he'd been left behind that desk", he wrote. [...] "Shatner has perhaps the least impressive movie physique since Rod Steiger, and his acting style has begun to recall the worst of Richard Burton." [...] Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the actors {{did not have much}} to do in the effects-driven film, and were [...] "limited to the exchanging of meaningful glances or staring intently at <b>television</b> <b>monitors,</b> usually in disbelief". Stephen Collins and Persis Khambatta were more favorably received. Gene Siskel felt the film [...] "teeter towards being a crashing bore" [...] whenever Khambatta was not on screen, and Jack Kroll of Newsweek felt that she had the most memorable entrance in the film. [...] " [...] is sympathetic enough to make one hope she'll have a chance to show less skin and more hair in future films", Godfrey wrote.|$|E
