5|$|Sia {{is one of}} them. She comes in, singer-songwriter, {{she just}} writes the most {{beautiful}} amazing ballads. Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, and I just want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E

25|$|Kant {{cautions}} that we cannot feel or intuit <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> the understanding. He also stresses {{that we are}} unable to make interesting positive claims about it because we are not able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could {{have anything to say about}} practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We just have to be careful not to get carried away and make claims that we are not entitled to.|$|E

500|$|In the Advaita Vedanta of the 8th century Indian philosopher Śaṅkara, the mind, {{body and}} world are all {{held to be}} the same unchanging eternal {{conscious}} entity called Brahman. Advaita, which means non-dualism, holds the view that all that exists is pure absolute consciousness. The fact that the world seems to be made up of changing entities is an illusion, or Maya. The only thing that exists is Brahman, which is described as Satchitananda (Being, consciousness and bliss). Advaita Vedanta is best described by a verse which states [...] "Brahman is alone True, and <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> plurality is an error; the individual self is not different from Brahman".|$|E

500|$|In October 2009, {{the track}} was {{released}} as the album's buzz single, {{not intended to}} be the first release of Raymond v. Raymond, but to generate reception and feedback. In March 2010, Usher continued to support Garrett's original claims, stating the song was recorded before his marriage ended. Usher said in an interview for MTV News for promoting Raymond v. Raymond: [...] "I think people would have immediately alluded to the fact I was talking about my wife when I made that record — and now my ex-wife," [...] he said. [...] "When the song was recorded, I wasn't divorced. It was some reality in the contrast of trying to make it all work, having to balance a career and having a normal life. Coming in at 6 in the morning and arguing was a reality when you have those type of relationships. I felt that in a way, the story did touch on certain things at the time. I didn't know how realistic it would become. I didn't know I would become divorced. I did know it spoke on the contrast between trying to balance <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> being married and having this responsibility that's like a marriage at the same time. The song spoke to that place. Unfortunately, it did become a reality." ...|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were not}} as positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. [...] The two criticized the idea that Scully would give her child up for {{adoption}} solely based on the word of Jeffrey Spender, noting [...] "if she wasn't {{going to give it}} away for the sake of its own protection after a UFO cult abducted it , then why should she because Jeffrey Spender of all people comes along and informs her that it's under threat?" [...] Shearman and Pearson, however, did praise Chris Owens' acting, writing that he did a [...] "great job". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, wrote a largely negative review of the episode and derided its plot. He heavily criticized the idea that Scully would offer William up for adoption. Kessenich did however praise Duchovny's directing, noting that [...] " [...] did a masterful job of luring me back to <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> The X-Files". Aaron Kinney from Salon wrote that the episode [...] "scuttled the entire" [...] baby William subplot. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, praised the decision to conclude the William subplot but called the episode's conclusion [...] "sappy".|$|E
500|$|The 1960s {{setting of}} X-Men: First Class, technologically {{inspired}} by the James Bond films of that era, also added to the international feel of the characters. Kinberg said the series was a major influence for the way they [...] "did a cool job representing the period, {{in a way it}} still felt muscular and action-oriented", and Vaughn added that Magneto was his attempt to recreate Sean Connery's Bond in both style and the [...] "badass, charming, ruthless and sweet" [...] personality. The director said his goal was to [...] "feel like a '60s Bond film, but {{with a little bit of}} reality it could be grounded in. I wanted there to be just a hint of <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> the mutants coming through. A mutant in this world having powers needed to be the equivalent of you or I sneezing, as normal as possible, at least until the humans start seeing it for the first time." [...] At the same time, Vaughn tried to do the [...] "bloody hard balancing" [...] of modern and antique to recreate the 1960s in way it was [...] "not so alien to the kids that it looked like a period piece." [...] The director also tried to depict the era still in a realistic way, particularly [...] "that 60s misogynist vibe" [...] with women in skimpy suits, and McTaggert's reliability as a CIA agent being questioned.|$|E

2500|$|Many Dadaists {{believed}} that the 'reason' and 'logic' of bourgeois capitalist society had led people into war.

2500|$|Particularly {{within the}} context of {{religion}} – a domain which is often associated with sexual asceticism – Muḥammad is notable for emphasising the importance of loving women. According to a famous ḥadīth, Muḥammad stated: [...] "Three things of <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> yours were made lovable to me: women, perfume – and the coolness of my eye was placed in the ritual prayer". This is enormously significant because in the Islamic faith, Muḥammad is by definition the most perfect human being and the most perfect male: his love for women shows that the perfection of the human state is connected with love for other human beings, not simply with love for God. More specifically, it illustrates that male perfection lies in women and, by implication, female perfection in men. Consequently, the love Muḥammad had for women is obligatory on all men, since he is the model of perfection that must be emulated.|$|E

2500|$|A {{historian}} Breen {{wrote that}} Besant and Leadbeater {{were well aware}} how annoying stuff may be their book for a [...] "society that remained deeply conservative." [...] In early January 1901, when this book was published, [...] "Queen Victoria still ruled England. 'Modernism' as a movement or even a concept did not exist. When we consider <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> 1901, – further wrote Breen, – it becomes difficult not to believe that Besant, Leadbeater and their milieu deserve a more prominent place {{in the annals of}} both abstract art and the history of modernism." [...] As the art critic Kramer has pointed, [...] "what is particularly striking about the outlook of the artists primarily responsible for creating abstraction is their espousal of occult doctrine." [...] Yeats, Eliot, Malevich, Kandinsky, and Mondrian were charmed by Theosophy. In {{the first decades of the}} twentieth century, it was a widespread [...] "component of Western cultural life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cleansed premiered at the Royal Court's theatre {{downstairs in}} April 1998, and was {{directed}} by James Macdonald. This {{was at the time}} the most expensive production in the Royal Court's history. Kane had written the play after reading Roland Barthes' assertion that [...] "being in love is like being in Auschwitz". Cleansed is set in what Kane in her stage directions described as a university but which functions more as a torture chamber or concentration camp, overseen by the sadistic Tinker. It places a young woman and her brother, a disturbed boy, a gay couple and a peepshow dancer within <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> extreme cruelty in which declarations of love are viciously tested. It pushes the limits of what can be realised in the theatre: stage directions include [...] "a sunflower pushes through the floor and grows above their heads" [...] and [...] "the rats carry Carl's feet away". The play was presented at the National Theatre in London in 2016, the first time any of Kane's work had been performed there.|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{response}} to Rubber Soul was highly favourable. Allen Evans of the NME {{wrote that the}} band were [...] "still finding different ways to make us enjoy listening to them" [...] and described the LP as [...] "a fine piece of recording artistry and adventure in group sound". While outlining to American readers {{the differences in the}} UK-format release, KRLA Beat said Rubber Soul was an [...] "unbelievably sensational" [...] work on which the Beatles were [...] "once again... setting trends in <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> pop". Newsweeks reviewer lauded the Beatles as [...] "the Bards of Pop", saying that the album's combination of [...] "gospel, country, baroque counterpoint and even French popular ballads" [...] lent the band a unique style in which their songs were [...] "as brilliantly original as any written today". Like Newsweek, The New York Times had belittled the group when they first performed in America in February 1964, but following the release of Rubber Soul, according to author Bob Spitz, music critic Jack Gould offered a [...] "glowing tribute" [...] in the newspaper's Sunday magazine.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first line}} of the third quatrain extends the conceit of the Platonic theory, {{the idea that the}} {{perceptions}} of reality are merely reflections of the essential reality of forms. Platonic theory suggests that our perceptions are derived from <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> forms in the same way shadows are derived from the objects that are lit. The metaphor of shadow was often employed to help explain the illusory quality of perception and the reality of forms, both by Renaissance Platonists and by Plato himself in his book, Symposium. In the sonnet, spring can only offers shades of the beauty of the youth. The youth is presented as the ideal Beauty, the form, from which all other beautiful things come. This idea is summarized in line thirteen of the sonnet: [...] "In all external grace you have some part." [...] This line finds the youth to be the exclusive source of all beautiful things, expanding his [...] "domain" [...] even further than the first quatrains in which the youth {{is said to be the}} source of the legendary figures of Adonis and Helen.|$|E
2500|$|Following the August 23 Coup of 1944, {{in which}} the PSDR played a {{significant}} part, Antonescu was toppled, and Romania made a swift return to multiparty rule. During the subsequent democratic interval, Moscovici was commemorated by Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște with a belated obituary in Jurnalul de Dimineaţă: [...] "there are very few politicians in our country to have remained faithful to an idea their whole lives. [...] In <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> ours, Ilie Moscovici was and endured a socialist. He was not dissuaded by vain ambition. He was not frightened by poverty. He was not influenced by persecution." [...] Although the PSDR was rapidly expanding, claiming some 700,000 members in 1945, it was being undermined by the infiltration of communists, who, inspired by the Soviet occupation of Romania, worked to absorb it into a much smaller PCdR. Addressing {{the rank and file}} of the party, the pro-communist Ștefan Voitec claimed that the merger had been envisaged by Moscovici while he was still alive—a claim that is seen as [...] "opportunistic" [...] by journalist and historian Victor Frunză. The communist takeover was effected at the congress of March 1946, and facilitated in part by Voinea's last-minute defection.|$|E
2500|$|...

But at some point, you realise it takes more energy to shut it out than it does to let it happen and be a part of 'it'." [...] At one point, the song begins to skip, reminiscent of a skipping compact disc. Parker included this as an extension of his fascination with glitches in playback. [...] "Nangs" [...] has been noted for its interlude-like composition and its woozy, psychedelic sound. [...] "Yes I'm Changing" [...] is a song Parker claims he does not remember making: [...] "A weird experience, because it was like it was someone else made the song. I had no memory of imagining it." [...] "Eventually" [...] concerns [...] "knowing that you're about to damage someone almost irreparably, and the only consolation you get is this distant hope that they’ll be alright eventually, because you know they aren't going to be now or soon." [...] Parker conceded that he [...] "can't really deny" [...] it is a breakup song.|$|E
