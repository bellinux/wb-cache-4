I cannot help feeling at moments--if there were no Christ, everything, even the very flowers and insects, and every beautiful object, would be hell now--dark, blank, hopeless.|$|R

25|$|In {{regards to}} San Francisco, some {{interesting}} negative externalities are being experienced {{due to the}} dredging of land by the Bay. The Millennium Tower's, which were completed in 2008, are currently sinking. This has an extremely {{negative impact on the}} residents of this building, who have spent millions of dollars <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> building. In response to this engineering travesty, San Francisco's city attorney has decided to file a lawsuit against the developer because the developer failed to inform the residents of the accelerated speed that the building was sinking at. If this lawsuit results in success for San Francisco this could lead to policy changes being made in the future surrounding transparency between developers and potential buyers of the developed land.|$|E

25|$|This stork may be {{especially}} vulnerable in the llanos of Venezuela. Its population declined strongly there in recent past decades starting from 1977 and less than 5000 individuals were estimated <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> region {{through most of the}} 1980s. A potentially effective conservation strategy to help protect this stork's natural habitat in the llanos is the expansion and maintenance of cattle ranches in the savanna grassland matrix in preference to crop cultivation; because such ranches are similar in vegetation structure to natural grasslands. Another potentially useful conservation measure is the deployment of artificial nesting platforms to encourage nesting of maguari storks, as has been done for the white stork in Europe. Despite its relatively unthreatened overall status, the maguari stork should deserve closer global population monitoring to better safeguard it from future potential large-scale declines across its entire range.|$|E
25|$|The lower Himalayan foothills and Inner Terai or Doon Valleys of Nepal and India {{are highly}} malarial {{due to a}} warm climate and marshes {{sustained}} {{during the dry season}} by groundwater percolating down from the higher hills. Malarial forests were intentionally maintained by the rulers of Nepal as a defensive measure. Humans attempting <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> zone suffered much higher mortality than at higher elevations or below on the drier Gangetic Plain. However, the Tharu people had lived in this zone long enough to evolve resistance via multiple genes. Medical studies among the Tharu and non-Tharu population of the Terai yielded the evidence that the prevalence of cases of residual malaria is nearly seven times lower among Tharus. The basis for resistance has been established to be homozygosity of α-Thalassemia gene within the local population. Endogamy along caste and ethnic lines appear to have prevented these genes from being more widespread in neighboring populations.|$|E

2500|$|Krasner retold from a story {{related to}} him in long {{discussion}} with Schoenberg's son Görgi, a Jew who remained in Vienna during the war, that the Weberns, much to their risk and credit, had provided Görgi and his family with food and shelter {{toward the end of}} the war at the Weberns' home in a Mödling apartment belonging to their son-in-law. Görgi and his family were left behind for their safety when Webern fled on foot with his family to Mittersill, about 75km. away, for safety of their own in light of the coming Russian invasion; Amalie, one of Webern's daughters, wrote of '17 persons pressed together in the smallest possible space' upon their arrival. Ironically, the Russians pronounced Görgi a [...] "Nazi spy" [...] when he was discovered due to the Nazi munitions and propaganda in the Weberns' basement store-room. Görgi is said to have saved himself from execution by protesting and drawing attention to his clothes, sewn as specified by the Nazis with the yellow Star of David.

2500|$|Reports from expeditions in 1806 by Lieutenant Zebulon Pike and in 1819 by Major Stephen Long {{described}} the Great Plains as [...] "unfit for human habitation" [...] and as [...] "The Great American Desert". These descriptions were mainly {{based on the}} relative lack of timber and surface water. The images of sandy wastelands conjured up by terms like [...] "desert" [...] were tempered by the many reports of vast herds of millions of Plains Bison that somehow managed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> [...] "desert". In the 1840s, the Great Plains appeared to be unattractive for settlement and were illegal for homesteading until well after 1846 — initially it was set aside by the U.S. government for Indian settlements. The next available land for general settlement, Oregon, appeared to be free for the taking and had fertile lands, disease free climate (yellow fever and malaria were prevalent {{in much of the}} Missouri and Mississippi River drainage then), extensive uncut, unclaimed forests, big rivers, potential seaports, and only a few nominally British settlers.|$|E
2500|$|According to the treaty, only Europeans, principally Protestant British {{settlers}} {{were allowed}} <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area as {{outside of this}} confine, non-Indians {{were not allowed to}} own property. However, other national groups, chiefly FrenchPortuguese, and other Catholic merchants had separate agreements with the Nayak which allowed them in turn to establish trading posts, factories, and warehouses. As the East India Company controlled the trade in the area, these non-British merchants established agreements with the Company for settling on Company land near [...] "White Town" [...] per agreements with the Nayak. Over time, Indians also arrived in ever greater numbers and soon, the Portuguese and other non-Protestant Christian Europeans were outnumbered. Following several outbreaks of violence by various Hindu and Muslim Indian communities against the Christian Europeans, White Town's defenses and its territorial charter was expanded to incorporate most of the area which had grown up around its walls thereby incorporating most of its Catholic European settlements. In turn they resettled the non-European merchants and their families and workers, almost entirely Muslim or of various Hindu nationalities outside of the newly expanded [...] "White Town". This was also surrounded by a wall. To differentiate these non-European and non-Christian area from [...] "White Town", the new settlement was termed [...] "Black Town.
