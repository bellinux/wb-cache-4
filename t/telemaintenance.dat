40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of Prognostics and Health Management (P. H. M.), Health Monitoring {{can be seen as}} the first step to manage the global health state of complex systems. Health Monitoring of {{industrial}} systems focuses on accurately describing the health state of a system, using several equipment indicators. However, managers and maintainers have to make decisions. Such decisions can be hard to make while watching all indicators of the system simultaneously. In order to ease the decision making process, a synthetic indicator, which represent the actual system's state, can be used. In this paper, we will present an approach for building an aggregated indicator characterizing the global health state of a system. This approach was implemented on the TELMA platform (integrated <b>TELeMAintenance</b> platform for research and education) which simulates an industrial process...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAt present we {{can find}} {{different}} complementary definitions of the term e-Maintenance. These definitions apply to maintenance several principles and concepts such as collaboration, pro-activity, knowledge, intelligence, web services or the Internet. A clear consensus is not yet reached, even when some contributions try to propose unique repositories to ensure consistency. Consequently {{the aim of this}} paper is: (a) to discuss, briefly, on the concept of e-Maintenance and on a first conceptual e-Maintenance framework based on 5 abstraction levels in order; (b) to detail the last level named ‘‘infrastructure'' for illustrating e-Maintenance technologies and platforms. This level allows to put in evidence new technologies supporting e-Maintenance services and to describe e-Maintenance architecture resulting from the technology's integration. The main illustration is done with a <b>TELeMAintenance</b> platform (TELMA) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCEA LIST and AREVA {{have been}} {{developing}} remote operations devices, also called telerobotics for 15 years. These tools {{were designed for}} interventions in the AREVA nuclear spent fuel facilities hot cells. From these 15 years of joint research and development, several technological bricks have been industrialized and used at the AREVA La Hague facilities. This article presents some of these bricks and their industrial developments. The " TAO 2000 " CEA LIST telerobotics generic software controller will be first discussed. This controller {{has been used to}} teleoperate dedicated slave arms like the MT 200 TAO (an evolution of the conventional wall-transmission mechanical telemanipulator (MSM) [3]) as well as industrial robotic arms like the Stäubli RX robots. Both the MT 200 TAO and Stäubli RX TAO telerobotics systems provide force-feedback and are now ready to be used as <b>telemaintenance</b> tools at the AREVA La Hague facilities. Two recent maintenance operations using these tools will be detailed {{at the end of this}} paper...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{importance}} of the maintenance function has increased because of its role in keeping and improving system availability and safety, as well as product quality. To support this role, {{the development of the}} communication and information technologies has allowed the emergence of the concept of e-maintenance. Within the era of e-manufacturing and e-business, e-maintenance provides the opportunity for a new maintenance generation. As we will discuss later in this paper, e-maintenance integrates existing <b>telemaintenance</b> principles, with Web services and modern e-collaboration principles. Collaboration allows to share and exchange not only information but also knowledge and (e) -intelligence. By means of a collaborative environment, pertinent knowledge and intelligence become available and usable at the right place and time, in order to facilitate reaching the best maintenance decisions. This paper outlines the basic ideas within the e-maintenance concept and then provides an overview of the current research and challenges in this emerging field. An underlying objective is to identify the industrial/academic actors involved in the technological, organizational or management issues related to the development of e-maintenance. Today, this heterogeneous community has to be federated in order to bring up e-maintenance as a new scientific discipline...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRobotic {{teleoperation}} in cluttered environments {{is attracting}} increasing attention for its potential in hazardous scenarios, disaster response, and <b>telemaintenance.</b> Although haptic feedback {{has been proven}} effective in such applications, commercially-available grounded haptic interfaces still show significant limitations in terms of workspace, safety, transparency, and encumbrance. For this reason, we present a novel robotic teleoperation system with wearable haptic feedback for telemanipulation in cluttered environments. The slave system is composed of a soft robotic hand attached to a 6 -axis force sensor, which is fixed to a 6 -degrees-of-freedom robotic arm. The master system is composed of two wearable vibrotactile armbands and a Leap Motion. The armbands are worn on the upper arm and forearm, and convey information about collisions on the robotic arm and hand, respectively. The position of the manipulator and the grasping configuration of the robotic hand are controlled by the user's hand pose as tracked by the Leap Motion. To validate our approach, we carried out a human-subject telemanipulation experiment in a cluttered scenario. Twelve {{participants were asked to}} teleoperate the robot to grasp an object hidden between debris of various shapes and stiffnesses. Haptic feedback provided by our wearable devices significantly improved the performance of the considered telemanipulation tasks. All subjects but one preferred conditions with wearable haptic feedback...|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{communication}} {{is a critical}} link in our global military communication system. In scenarios ranging from the battlefield to the White House, we {{must be able to}} send information reliably without a cumbersome infrastructure. Wireless environments typically contain a large amount of multipath interference. Therefore, a waveform that is transmitted through a wireless channel must be robust to multipath. With this in mind, Harris Corporation and Lucent Corporation proposed the complementary code keying (CCK) waveform for the high data rate IEEE 802. 11 WLAN standard. The CCK waveform has proven to be robust in a harsh multipath environment. Harris Corporation is implementing this waveform in their PRISM chip which will be deployed by Harris GCSD in a number of military applications including inter- and intra-ship communication and military telemedicine and <b>telemaintenance.</b> This paper presents a new performance measure based on the distance between M-ary codes in a multipath environment. Significantly, this measure does not depend on knowledge of the multipath environment. Consequently, this measure is well suited for evaluating codes {{to be used in the}} many scenarios envisioned for wireless LANs. In the paper, this measure is described and then used to compare a number of M-ary codes. The results of this performance measure as well as performance simulations show that the CCK waveform performs well in a variety of multipath environments. I...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{industrial}} enterprises {{are facing}} up to new challenges to well optimize their performances, with regards not only to conventional performances (e. g. reliability or productivity) but also to emerging ones as those related to sustainability issues. Indeed, sustainability indicators {{have to be considered}} now in the decision-making process of the plant to better control and maintain it to be consistent with Green Production requirements. In that way, indicators such as Energy Efficiency or Energy Consumption are promoted for the impact they have on these requirements in a Life Cycle Cost vision. Thus the core idea defended in this paper is addressing the necessary evolution of conventional maintenance decision-making process in industry for considering the energy efficiency indicator. To support the idea, the first objective is to define the concept of energy efficiency indicator which materializes the energy efficiency performance at a specific time. The definition is done for different abstraction levels such as component, function, system which are subjected to time-dependent degradation behaviors. So, the energy efficiency indicator concept is expressed as the amount of energy consumed per unit of useful output, which has {{to be seen as a}} sustainable performance measure of industrial system. Then a mathematical formulation is proposed to calculate energy efficiency indicator at any time of the performance by considering dependent factors (static and dynamic ones) impacting inputs and outputs of the system. The second objective is to propose a new concept named REEL (Remaining energy-efficient lifetime) for tracking the energy efficiency performance evolution. The REEL is defined by the time left before the system loses its energy efficiency property considered as a specific EEI value (EEI threshold) not to be exceeded. This specific value is technically and/or economically fixed in advance, given the current condition, past and future operation profiles. The REEL could be used as an appropriate indicator for maintenance decision-making process in a proactive vision. The third objective is to formalize a generic approach in the way assess the REEL value. The assessment requires to forecast the evolution of energy efficiency indicator (whatever the abstraction level is) by taking into account the static and dynamic factors. Finally, the feasibility and added value of our proposals are illustrated on a manufacturing platform named TELMA (<b>TELeMAintenance)</b> ...|$|E
