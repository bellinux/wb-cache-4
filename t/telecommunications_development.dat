This reality is reflected {{in the state of the}} country's <b>telecommunications</b> <b>development.</b> It is estimated that in 2012 there were only 5000 fixed telephone lines serving the country's 1.6 million inhabitants and that only 2.9% of the population had access to and were regular users of the Internet.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 15 or 20 years, {{telecommunications}} and information technologies (IT) {{have become more}} intensely bound up {{than ever before in}} the social, economic, political and cultural processes and transformations which are increasingly concentrated in and between key strategic urban places across the globe. By analyzing <b>telecommunications</b> <b>developments</b> in Paris and London, this book offers an explicit comparative and cross-national approach to the <b>development</b> of urban <b>telecommunications</b> infrastructures and to the development of global cities through a focus on these crucial infrastructures. The case studies are founded solidly on a critical discussion of and engagement with the most relevant and recent debates and theories in urban studies, geography and planning. By examining differing, but parallel influences of national, urban and local contexts, processes and practices bound up in <b>telecommunications</b> <b>developments,</b> the book firmly underlines the inherently territorial basis of these developments and their multi-scalar elements and implications, all of which are being reinforced by the current stringent strategic retrenching of telecommunications operations around the globe.

40|$|The general role of <b>telecommunications</b> in {{economic}} <b>development</b> has been recognized, but there remain some important specific issues in matching <b>telecommunications</b> planning to <b>development</b> goals. The author suggests a new approach, based on models relating regional structure to telecommunications demand. Data, which are readily available, on populations in places {{and rural areas}} within a region are used to derive a regional structure composed of places and the links between them. These links {{are found to be}} very closely related to telecommunications demand. This article suggests that <b>telecommunications</b> and <b>development</b> planners in the Third World should pay particular attention to ensuring that all the links between places in a region are served, and that the models presented here could form the basis for suitable planning criteria. <b>Telecommunications</b> planning Regional <b>development</b> Central place theory...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} how telecommunications infrastructure affects economic growth. We use evidence from 21 OECD countries over a 20 -year period {{to examine the}} impacts that <b>telecommunications</b> <b>developments</b> may have had. We jointly estimate a micromodel for telecommunication investment with a macro production function. We find evidence of a significant positive causal link, especially when {{a critical mass of}} telecommunications infrastructure is present. Interestingly, the critical mass appears to be at a level of telecommunications infrastructure that is near universal service. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this thesis I give an {{overview}} of the political-economic and <b>telecommunications</b> sector <b>developments</b> in major western economies, as well as some of the advanced Eastern European countries. I use this framework to analyze the <b>telecommunications</b> sector <b>development</b> in countries of the former Yugoslavia: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro. Here I address the relevant legal and regulatory landscape development as well as the entrance of the most important business actors in the telecommunications markets of these countries. The history of the <b>telecommunications</b> sector <b>development</b> is also placed in the context of a broader set of political and economic shocks that affected this region of the world after the fall of the Iron Curtain. Throughout the thesis I build on insights learned during the research internship project that I undertook this summer: I visited capitals of all the former Yugoslavian countries and gathered data relevant to the <b>telecommunications</b> sector <b>development</b> by interviewing government and business sector officials there. This information is heavily used for the derivation of a set of policy recommendations and options that government officials should consider for advancing the <b>development</b> of the <b>telecommunications</b> technologies in the countries of the former Yugoslavia. Strategies for <b>telecommunications</b> sector <b>development,</b> their barriers, and solutions for surmounting these barriers are presented in the third part of this thesis. by Adnan Sulejmanpasic.

The authors develop an 'activist' view of the role of telecommunications as a component of energy-conservation policy. Advanced telecommunications offer an alternative to many forms of travel. The results of research aimed at quantifying and comparing the direct energy consumption of travel and telecommunications are presented. <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>developments</b> can induce changes in business organisation, transport, urban development, and environmental quality, as well as increased freedom of location.

We use evidence from 21 OECD countries over the past twenty years to examine the impacts that <b>telecommunications</b> <b>developments</b> may have had. We estimate a structural model which endogenizes telecommunication investment by specifying a micro-model of supply and demand for telecommunication investments. The micromodel is then jointly estimated with the macro-growth equation. After controlling for country-specific fixed effects, we find evidence of a positive causal link, provided that a critical mass of telecommunication infrastructure is present...|$|R
