5|$|Four {{different}} long-term expansion {{proposals were}} put forward between 1964 and 1991 which all proposed adding numerous lines <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> {{as well as}} extending the existing ones. Given the political instability characteristic of Argentina during this time, none of these proposals came to fruition, though aspects {{of them have been}} incorporated into contemporary expansion plans. One additional proposal put forward in 1973 saw the unification of the city's commuter rail lines through underground tunnels and incorporated into the Buenos Aires Underground, and while this was also shelved, it has been adapted into the current Red de Expresos Regionales proposal.|$|E

5|$|The Buenos Aires Underground has had {{among the}} longest serving and most varied rolling {{stock in the}} world, in part due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> having been {{originally}} built and operated by three different companies in its early years, causing incompatibilities between the lines. The network began with uniform rolling stock, with the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company Anglo-Argentine Line A using La Brugeoise cars (with {{the exception of a}} few UEC Preston cars), the three CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) using Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel stock and Lacroze's Line B using Metro Cammell cars. However, as the lines were expanded and passenger numbers increased, more rolling stock was needed, which made the network less uniform, particularly with regards to the problematic Line B, which used a different electrification system and measurements to the other lines. Line B also became the first line of the network to receive second-hand rolling stock in 1995.|$|E
