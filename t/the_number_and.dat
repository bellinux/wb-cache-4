5|$|A 2012 {{study by}} Schott and David C. Evans found that <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>and</b> {{shape of the}} {{individual}} nodes on the squamosal shelf of the examined S. validum skulls varied considerably, and that this variability {{does not seem to}} correlate with ontogenic changes, but was due to individual variation.

5|$|After Victoria {{converted}} to alphanumeric route markers the Victorian section was signed as B23. In 2013 the NSW and ACT conversion to alphanumeric routes occurred {{and the remainder}} of the highway (south of Hindmarsh Drive in the ACT) was then also signed as B23. This violates the convention in New South Wales, where numbered routes below 50 are prefixed with an 'A' and 'B' routes are numbered above 50; the violation was allowed so <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>and</b> letter would be consistent across state lines.|$|E

30|$|Recently, many {{authors have}} studied special <b>numbers</b> <b>and</b> polynomials with their {{generating}} functions.

It is well-known that there are also many combinatorial interpretations of these special <b>numbers</b> especially, <b>the</b> Stirling <b>numbers</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> central factorial <b>numbers</b> in partition theory, in set theory, in probability theory and in other sciences. For combinatorial interpretations of these special <b>numbers</b> <b>and</b> polynomials with their generating functions see for details [1 – 31], and the references therein.|$|R

5|$|Each somite, or body segment {{can bear}} {{a pair of}} appendages: on the {{segments}} of the head, these include two pairs of antennae, the mandibles and maxillae; the thoracic segments bear legs, which may be specialised as pereiopods (walking legs) and maxillipeds (feeding legs). The abdomen bears pleopods, and ends in a telson, which bears the anus, and is often flanked by uropods to form a tail fan. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>and</b> variety of appendages in different crustaceans may be {{partly responsible for the}} group's success.|$|E
