5|$|Automatic {{closure of}} public schools which racially {{integrate}} — The legislation required that any school which integrated (voluntarily or not) must be immediately and automatically closed. However, the governor was given the discretion to take over integrated school(s) and reopen the school(s) on a segregated basis rather than close the entire district. Integrated schools {{did not have to}} stay closed, however. A school district could petition the governor to take over one or more schools (or the entire district) that had closed and reopen them as segregated schools. Whether exercising his discretion or acting on a petition from the school district, the governor was authorized to act only as an agent of the Assembly. The governor was also required to try to persuade the African American child to return to his or her racially segregated school, so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> could reopen on a segregated basis.|$|E

25|$|Straw's first Shadow Cabinet post was as Education {{spokesman}} from 1987.

He also stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> should be free to enter the state system. His comments came at a time of great controversy regarding the funding of Muslim schools. Straw argued that the controversy arose out of ignorance and stereotyping about women's role in Islam, pointing out that Muslim women acquired property rights centuries before European women.|$|E

25|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy did {{not join}} {{the rest of the}} opinion by the Chief Justice, therefore, those parts of the opinion did not command a majority. In this Plurality Opinion, Roberts wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Schools</b> at issue contend that a racially diverse {{environment}} is beneficial for education and they submit this as the reason why they consider race alone in their school assignments. However, Roberts considers that this interest is not compelling and that the use of race for this goal is not narrowly tailored, it is instead used for racial balancing, which is unconstitutional. The schools base their numbers in demographics, therefore making this goal a means to achieve a numerical quota to achieve racial balancing. Roberts concludes that racial balancing cannot be a compelling state interest.|$|E

500|$|The School for Creative and Performing Arts arose, in part, as a {{response}} to the recurring desegregation battles in the Cincinnati Public Schools (CPS) in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

500|$|After {{her visit}} to the queen, Trimmer was {{inspired}} to write The Œconomy of Charity, which describes how readers, specifically women, can establish Sunday schools in their own communities. However, her book accomplished much more than this. While proponents of Sunday schools such as Raikes and Trimmer claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> would help control the growing social unrest of the poor, critics claimed that these schools would only encourage the social upheaval {{they were trying to}} quell. The Hon. John Byng, for example, issued the dire warning that [...] "not only would education 'teach them to read seditious pamphlets, books and publications against Christianity'… but it would render them unfit for 'the laborious employment to which their rank in society had destined them'". Trimmer agreed that the poor were [...] "destined" [...] by God to be poor but would argue that her schools reinforced that divine social hierarchy. The Sunday school debate was waged in churches, in Parliament and in print; in publishing The Œconomy of Charity, Trimmer was entering this vigorous debate.|$|E
500|$|A thirteen-year {{rivalry with}} Nicholls State University {{ended with the}} 2011 {{football}} season. [...] It began in 1998 when the annual football game between the two schools was at first cancelled due to severe flooding in San Marcos, where the game was to be played. [...] The athletic directors and coaches later decided to postpone the game from October to November. [...] To remember those affected by the floods, including some people {{who had died in}} it, a wooden oar was made with each school's colors and initials. [...] The winning school would take possession of the oar for the next year and have the score inscribed on it. [...] This rivalry became known as the Battle for the Paddle. [...] The oar was last traded in 2010 when Nicholls State received it following 47-44 win over Texas State after four overtimes. [...] Prior to the schools' meeting in 2011, Rob Bernardi, the Athletic Director for Nicholls State, said {{that they would not be}} bringing the oar to San Marcos and would leave it on display in the Nicholls State athletic offices. [...] Due to Texas State changing conferences, Bernardi said it was unlikely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> will face each other in football again and that the rivalry was ending.|$|E
500|$|As well, anarchist activists {{focussed}} much {{of their}} energy towards preparing society for social revolution through education. Anarchists ran schools for children {{to run counter to}} the Catholic schools and public schools, believing that religious schools were anathema to their ideas of freedom, and that public schools were too often used to instill ideas of [...] "patriotic nationalism" [...] and discourage free thought in children. In issues of ¡Tierra!, a weekly anarchist newspaper (published from 1899 through 1915, putting out more than 600 issues), writers denounced the public school requirement to pay allegiance to the Cuban flag, and encouraged teaching children that the flag was a symbol of [...] "closed mindedness and divisiveness." [...] Anarchists claimed that students enrolled in such schooling would become [...] "cannon fodder" [...] for a conflict of Liberal and Conservative Party leaders in 1906, which caused the US to intervene and occupy Cuba through 1909. Though anarchists had been running schools since that of the Círculo de Trabajadores, it wasn't until 1906 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> began to take on a less traditional flavor. In 1908, anarchists included a manifesto in issues of ¡Tierra! and La Voz del Dependiente, calling for the establishment of schools modeled after Francesc Ferrer's Escuela Moderna (Modern School).|$|E

500|$|Trimmer also {{founded and}} oversaw charity schools in her neighborhood. She {{directed}} promising students from her Sunday schools, which met {{only once a}} week, to these charity schools, which met several times a week. As she wrote in her journal, these schools seemed to her to [...] "afford a happy prospect of rescuing many poor children from vice and profligacy". While the Sunday schools were funded by subscription, that is, donations from people within the parish, the charity schools were largely funded by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SPCK), which had funded the first charity schools around a century earlier. Trimmer criticized the rote learning {{that went on in}} traditional charity schools and tried to institute a more dynamic catechetical method in her own schools that would stimulate students to ask questions. She wrote in her journal, [...] "my earnest desire is to compose a course of teaching for Charity Schools, by which the children may learn in reality, and not by rote, the principles of the Christian Religion, as taught in the Scriptures". Trimmer also established schools of industry to which she directed her less promising pupils. These schools would teach girls, for example, how to knit and spin. Initially, Trimmer believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> would turn a profit since the girls would spin and knit all day long; however, the girls were unskilled and turned out poor products that could not be sold. Trimmer viewed this project as a failure.|$|E
