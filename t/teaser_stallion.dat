50|$|Lath was a bay colt bred by Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin, and foaled in 1732. His dam was Roxana, a {{daughter}} of Bald Galloway. In 1731 she {{was intended to be}} covered by Hobgoblin, but he refused her and she was sent to the Godolphin Arabian, who at the time was acting as a <b>teaser</b> <b>stallion</b> to Hobgoblin. The mating produced Lath, who was the Godolphin Arabian's first foal. Roxana later foaled Roundhead (by Flying Childers) and Cade (also by Godolphin Arabian). After Lath's success on the racetrack the Godolphin Arabian {{went on to become a}} top stallion and was champion sire in 1738, 1745 and 1747. He sired Cade, Regulus and Blank who also went on to become champion sires.|$|E
40|$|We {{observed}} {{structural changes}} in the follicles and uterus of heavy draft mares during estrus and examined {{the effect of a}} single injection of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog buserelin on ovulation and endocrine profiles. Twenty-two heavy draft mares were divided into a buserelin-treated group (n= 8) and a control group (n= 14). Mares were given an intramuscular injection of 40 µg buserelin when they presented signs of estrus to a <b>teaser</b> <b>stallion,</b> had ≥ 45 mm diameter follicles, and presented decreased uterine edema compared with the previous examination. The follicles and uterus were monitored using transrectal ultrasound imaging and measurement of blood levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), progesterone, and estradiol- 17 β. The ovulation rates within 48 hr was significantly higher in the treated group (100 %, 8 / 8) than in the control group (57. 1 %, 8 / 14; P= 0. 051). The mean ± SEM time before confirmation of ovulation was 29 ± 9 hr for the treated group and 59 ± 7 hr for the control group. There {{were no significant differences in}} mating frequency, double ovulation rate, or fertility rate between the two groups. One to two days after administering buserelin, LH and FSH temporarily increased, and in the control group, LH was high during ovulation, whereas FSH temporarily increased with the growth of the follicle. These results indicate that a single injection of 40 µg buserelin when follicles are at least 45 mm in diameter and uterine edema is decreased is effective for inducing ovulation. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of horse breeding industry in Indonesia was commenced through horse racing events held {{all over the}} country. It were accelerated by the {{development of}} Thoroughbred-Indonesian local Crossbred horses. There are many broodmares injured during their racing time and retired from the racetracks. They may still has a reproductive vigor to continue on producing offsprings. Very little information has been reported on the monitoring the reproductive capacity of the mares. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore ultrasonography imaging of the ovarian dynamics, correlated with the estrus behavior of the Thoroughbred-Indonesian local crossbred mares. Three Thoroughbred-Indonesian local crossbred mares with 6. 25 - 12. 5 % of local genetics aged 12 - 20 years old were used in this study. Estrus and ovulation were synchronized by 10 mg PGF 2 α i. m. at luteal phase and 1, 500 IU hCG i. m. injection when the dominant follicle reach ≥ 30 mm in diameter. Ultrasonography examination was done every morning at approximately at the same time. Estrus behavior was observed by using <b>teaser</b> <b>stallions</b> following a standard method. Results of the experiment indicated that onset of the estrus was reached 1. 33 ± 0. 58 days after the hCG injection, with the average duration of 4. 00 ± 1. 00 days. The ovulations were done at 5. 33 ± 1. 15 days after PGF 2 α treatment and 66. 67 ± 10. 07 hours after hCG treatment. Maximum follicle diameter was identified to reach 4. 50 ± 0. 52 cm at one day before ovulation. The mares performed 25. 4 ± 3. 38 days length of estrus cycle with 2 - 3 follicular  waves. It had been identified that the estrus duration  was   6. 8 ± 1. 92  days  in mares with the age of 12 - 20 years. The average of maximum diameter of the largest follicle before ovulation was 4. 2 ± 1. 24 cm. In conclusion, to improve the efficiency of breeding, several information are needed i. e. the optimal time of ovulation, relevan parameters related to follicular development...|$|R
40|$|The epidemiology, {{characterisation}} and vaccination {{responses to}} equine influenza (EI) in Ireland were studied between 2007 and 2010. Epidemiological evidence indicated a seasonal pattern to outbreaks with 50 % and 39 % occurring {{over the summer}} and winter months, respectively. Outbreaks were recorded in 13 of the 32 counties {{and the majority of}} cases occurred following animal movement on or off premises. Other key influences included housing type and fomites/personnel. Epidemiological evidence revealed poor vaccine compliance on premises where horses were infected with EI, while on premises where vaccination was widely practiced, the duration of vaccination history and time since last vaccination influenced disease expression. In a population of 1149 horses/ponies with mixed levels of antibody, 34 %, 11 %, 32 % and 23 % were considered to have index case potential, partial protection, clinical protection and virological protection respectively. Younger animals were identified as most susceptible to EI and the majority of <b>teaser</b> <b>stallions</b> had little serological evidence of vaccination. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene of 18 EI viruses identified suggested that predominant strains circulating among Irish horses were from clade 1 and clade 2 of the Florida sublineage. Equine influenza vaccine efficacy was examined in two different equine populations, mature National Hunt (NH) horses and immunologically naïve Thoroughbred (TB) weanlings. There {{was no significant difference between}} the levels of antibody response induced following booster vaccination with any of the six vaccines in the NH population. While the mean SRH levels post booster vaccination suggested that this population was clinically protected, analysis of the individual responses suggested that there was potential for vaccine breakdown among some horses. Antibody responses of weanlings vaccinated with the whole virus vaccine Duvaxyn IET Plus were significantly higher than those of the horses vaccinated with any of the other products. A high incidence of poor responders was observed post first vaccination (V 1). Vaccination of weanlings which had maternally-derived antibodies effectively primed the animals but in some cases their response to the primary course was lower than that of seronegative weanlings. Overall, the results indicated that EI is endemic in Ireland. Vaccine compliance is good within certain sectors of the industry however, there are vulnerable subgroups where vaccination is poorly executed thus creating potential pockets of disease and facilitating virus spread.

40|$|Canisso, I. F., Carvalho, G. R., Davies Morel, M. C. G., Guimaraes, J. D., McDonnell, S. M. (2010). Sexual {{behavior}} and ejaculate characteristics in Pega donkeys (Equus asinus) mounting estrous horse mares (Equus caballus). Theriogenology, 73, (1), 56 - 63 IMPF: 02. 04 RONO: 00 The objectives were to (i) characterize sexual behavior of donkey stallions (jacks; Equus asinus) during on-farm semen collection using estrous horse mares (mares; Equus caballus); (ii) compare behavior of young (less experienced) versus older (more experienced) jacks; (iii) determine whether semen suitable for artificial insemination (AI) could be collected using mares; and (iv) determine {{the suitability of}} using mares in field collection of semen from jacks. Six P?ga jacks (3. 5 to 16 yr old), previously conditioned to breed mares, were used. Mount mares were confirmed in estrus by a <b>teaser</b> horse <b>stallion</b> (stallion) and a jack. Semen was collected with an artificial vagina, at intervals of 48 to 72 h (180 collections). The mean ? SD (young [3. 5 yr] vs. old [14 to 16 yr]) were Flehmen response frequency, 7. 4 ? 5. 8 (8. 1 ? 3. 0 vs. 7. 0 ? 2. 0); number of mounts without erection, 1. 1 ? 1. 3 (2. 1 ? 1. 4 vs. 1. 2 ? 0. 4, P < 0. 05); latency from first exposure to mare to full erection on the ejaculatory mount, 18. 3 ? 17. 7 min (25. 3 ? 21. 3 vs. 12. 2 ? 6. 2, P < 0. 05); latency from erection to insertion, 5. 1 ? 3. 5 sec (5. 3 ? 3. 8 vs. 4. 8 ? 3. 2); and duration of copulation from insertion to dismount after ejaculation, 25. 4 ? 7. 8 sec (22. 1 ? 2. 9 vs. 28. 1 ? 9. 3). In all jacks, sexual behavior was generally normal, with the notable absence of open mouth behavior. Mare estrous behavior was markedly less intense than that {{in the presence of}} a stallion and usually absent. Semen characteristics were gel free volume, 47. 3 ? 28. 7 mL; gel volume, 71. 8 ? 54. 8 mL; total motility, 84. 3 ? 6. 0 %; progressive motility, 74. 3 ? 74. 5 %; sperm vigor, 3. 9 ? 0. 5 (scale 1 to 5); sperm concentration, 253 ? 106 cells/mL; and total number of sperm, 10. 3 ? 109 cells. Copulation duration was significantly correlated with gel free volume (r = 0. 9) and gel volume (r = 0. 7). We concluded that (i) the sexual behavior of jacks during semen collection using mares was similar to that reported for natural mating to jennies, (ii) precopulatory and copulatory behavior for the young (less experienced) jacks and older (more experienced) jacks were generally similar (except number of mounts without erection and latency to full erection); (iii) semen obtained using mares as stimulus and mount females was similar to that reported with estrous jennies; and (iv) semen collection from previously conditioned jacks, using estrous mares, was appropriate for field collection of semen.
