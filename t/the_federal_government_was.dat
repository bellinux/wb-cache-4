5|$|A {{constitutional}} {{convention was}} convened in Salt Lake City on March 8, 1849, {{to work on}} a proposal for federal recognition of a state or territory. The convention resulted in the provisional State of Deseret. Deseret claimed most of present-day Utah, Nevada and Arizona, with parts of California, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming. Brigham Young was elected governor on March 12, 1849, and the legislature first met on July 2, 1849.

5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|At that time, <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> subsidizing oil prices, {{driving the}} price up from $.35 a barrel in 1862 to {{as high as}} $13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with {{thousands}} of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes {{in the ground and}} gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water.|$|E

George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} lauded for its {{swift and}} thorough preparation to which most observers, including the United Nations, attributed Dean's low death toll.

Members of President Felipe Calder√≥n's Partido Accion Nacional (PAN) distributed bags of bread, funded by the nation's disaster relief coffers, carrying the party's logo. In Veracruz Governor Fidel Herrera was accused by both the PAN and his own Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) of using state resources, including hurricane relief, to support the campaigns of PRI candidates.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1841, {{the federal}} {{government}} faced a projected budget deficit of $11 million. Tyler recognized the need for higher tariffs, but wished {{to stay within the}} 20 percent rate created by the 1833 Compromise Tariff. He also supported a plan to distribute to the states any revenue from the sales of public land, as an emergency measure to manage the states' growing debt, even though this would cut federal revenue. The Whigs supported high protectionist tariffs and national funding of state infrastructure, and so there was enough overlap to forge a compromise. The Distribution Act of 1841 created a distribution program, with a ceiling on tariffs at 20 percent; a second bill increased tariffs to that figure on previously low-tax goods. Despite these measures, by March 1842 it had become clear that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> still in dire fiscal straits.|$|E

The {{deficit was}} $55.6 billion in 2009 and was gradually lowered to $5.2 billion in 2013. In 2014, {{the federal budget}} was balanced with a surplus of $1.9 billion.

The Economist magazine stated that Canada had come out the recession stronger than any other rich country in the G7. In 2013, Canada came out with Global Markets Action Plan to generate employment opportunities for Canadians.|$|E
5|$|MIT {{was elected}} to the Association of American Universities in 1934 and remains a {{research}} university with a very high level of research activity; research expenditures totaled $718.2 million in 2009. <b>The</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> the largest source of sponsored research, with the Department of Health and Human Services granting $255.9 million, Department of Defense $97.5 million, Department of Energy $65.8 million, National Science Foundation $61.4 million, and NASA $27.4 million. MIT employs approximately 1300 researchers in addition to faculty.

5|$|Site {{preparation}} for L'Enfant promenade and plaza began in November 1965. Air rights over 9th Street SW were granted for a rent of $500 {{per year for}} 99 years on November 23, 1965. The actual groundbreaking for L'Enfant Plaza occurred on December 9 but the project was still hindered by delays. <b>The</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> building the James V. Forrestal Building at {{the northern end of}} L'Enfant promenade, and the whole northern end of the promenade and the associated roadway was a year behind its construction schedule by June 1967. Meanwhile, over-optimistic construction schedules and labor shortages meant L'Enfant Plaza Corp's building of the North and South buildings were six months behind projected schedules. The $23 million complex neared completion in January 1968, and the office buildings, plaza, and promenade opened to the public and businesses in June 1968. The plaza was formally dedicated on Saturday, November 16, 1968.|$|E

5|$|Benjamin Harrison died in 1791. William Henry {{dropped the}} study of {{medicine}} and used Benjamin's connections with the Founding Fathers to get a commission in the Army. The seat of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> then in Philadelphia, and President Washington granted him a commission. Harrison served under Mad Anthony Wayne, fighting against Native Americans {{in what is now}} western Ohio. He was promoted to captain and made commander of Fort Washington before returning to civilian life in 1798, disliking garrison duty. He was already seeking another position through his government connections, and the same year was appointed by President John Adams as secretary of the Northwest Territory. The following year, the territorial legislature narrowly elected him the territory's delegate to Congress. In 1800, the Indiana Territory was separated from the Northwest, and Harrison was made territorial governor by President Adams, a position he would hold for over a decade. Prior to taking office, he bought a large tract of land from his father-in-law, along the Ohio River at North Bend. When Harrison purchased it, there was a log cabin on the property, but by 1840 the structure had been absorbed into the mansion that stood there.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{crews of}} the government's Department of Social Security (DSS) visited {{locations}} throughout the region, receiving damage claims, requests for monetary aid, and filings for unemployment benefits. The Commonwealth pledged to provide $150million in relief {{over a three-year}} period to the government of Queensland in exchange for deregulation; however, its offer was initially rejected. Planes flew claims adjusters and other officials to Innisfail, establishing an insurance emergency service in the city hall, while the Insurance Council of Queensland deployed its special emergency service employees for the first time. As a result of severe damage, a disaster declaration for northern regions was issued by Queensland Government on 4February. The first $10million in aid from the state government, paid by <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government,</b> <b>was</b> supplied the same day. Meanwhile, the SES continued its cleanup efforts, removing debris and repairing structures. Looters took advantage of confusion in the days following the cyclone, striking residences throughout Innisfail. By the end of the day, 2200tarpaulins had been distributed; however, the previously-smooth relief efforts were impeded by thunderstorms in Cairns.|$|E
5|$|Historian James C. Klotter has speculated that, had John C.

Burdened with her husband's debts, widow Mary Breckinridge and her {{children}} moved to her in-laws' home near Lexington, Kentucky, where John C. Breckinridge's grandmother taught him the political philosophies of his late grandfather, U.S. Attorney General John Breckinridge. John Breckinridge believed <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> created by, and subject to, the co-equal governments of the states. As a state representative, he introduced the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 and 1799, which denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts and asserted that states could nullify them and other federal laws that they deemed unconstitutional.
