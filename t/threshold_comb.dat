40|$|An optical {{frequency}} comb {{is a series}} of equally spaced frequency components. It has gained much attention since Nobel physics prize was awarded John L. Hall and Theodor W. HÃ¤nsch for their contribution to the {{optical frequency}} comb technique in 2005. The optical frequency comb has been extensively studied because of its precision as a tool for spectroscopy, and is now widely used in bio- and chemical sensors, optical clocks, mode-locked dark pulse generation, soliton generation, and optical communication. Recently, thanks to the developments in nanotechnology, the optical frequency comb generation is made possible at a chip-scale level with microresonators. However, because the threshold power of the optical frequency comb generation is beyond the capability of the on-chip laser source, efficient microresonator is required. Here, we demonstrate an ultra-compact and highly efficient strip-slot direct mode coupler, aiming to achieve slotted silicon microresonator cladded with nonlinear polymer Poly-DDMEBT in SOI platform. As an application of the strip-slot direct mode coupling, a double slot fiber-to-chip edge coupler is demonstrated showing 2 dB insertion loss reduction compared to the conventional single tip edge coupler. For silicon nitride platform, we investigated evanescent wave coupling of microresonator, focusing on bus waveguide geometry optimization. The optimized waveguide width offers an efficient excitation of a fundamental mode in the resonator waveguide. This investigation can benefit low <b>threshold</b> <b>comb</b> generation by enhancing the extinction ratio. We experimentally demonstrated the high Q-factor micro-ring resonator with intrinsic Q of 12. 6 million as well as the single FSR comb generation with 63 mW. ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, optical {{frequency}} combs from a mode-locked laser {{have been used as}} a ruler in frequency domain for extremely precise measurements. With a series of peaks equally spaced in optical frequency, it gives a significant improvement on the increasing demands of optical frequency metrology, telecommunication, optical clocks and measurements on the atomic level. However, optical frequency combs, based on fiber or free-space optics, are now restricted by further downsizing the optical paths and therefore, with these conventional combs, it is hard to achieve a repetition rate in radio frequencies ranging from several tens GHz to THz. ^ Recently, high-quality (Q) microresonators offer the potential for on-chip comb generation with a repetition rate from tens GHz to several THz. These frequency combs may also support the generation of octave-spanning comb spectra in compact and chip-level devices. This novel Kerr comb technology benefits the developments of integrated photonics. Here, in this thesis, the author discusses the microresonator-based frequency combs from silicon nitride waveguide microrings. Owing to its compatibility with CMOS-compatible fabrication process and large Kerr nonlinearity, silicon nitride has attracted considerable attention for on-chip comb generation. ^ The thesis is organized as follows: Chapter 1 gives brief reviews of optical frequency combs and the properties of silicon nitride waveguide resonators. In Chapter 2, on-chip comb generation and the properties of the generated combs, including communication performance, intensity noise, and time-domain characterization, are investigated. A drop-port study and power transfer in microrings are presented in Chapter 3. The comb-enhanced coupling, <b>comb</b> <b>threshold,</b> and <b>comb</b> efficiency at the through port are also discussed. In Chapter 4, the author compares the comb generation in both normal and anomalous cavity dispersion. Time-domain autocorrelation measurements will be demonstrated to characterize the comb generation in different dispersion regimes. In Chapter 5, the mode-locking transition and soliton formation in anomalous dispersion regime will be discussed. A short, bright, and close to transform-limited pulse is identified in time with a drop-port geometry. Finally, a summary is given in Chapter 6. ...|$|R
40|$|Kerr optical {{frequency}} combs with multi-gigahertz spacing have previously {{been demonstrated in}} chip-scale microresonators, with potential applications in coherent communication, spectroscopy, arbitrary waveform generation, and radio frequency photonic oscillators. In general, the harmonics of a frequency comb are identically polarized in a single microresonator. In this work, we report that one comb in one polarization is generated by an orthogonally polarized soliton comb and two low-noise, orthogonally polarized combs {{interact with each other}} and exist simultaneously in a single microresonator. The second comb generation is attributed to the strong cross-phase modulation with the orthogonally polarized soliton comb and the high peak power of the intracavity soliton pulse. Experimental results show that a second frequency comb is excited even when a continuous wave light as a "seed"-with power as low as 0. 1 mW-is input, while its own power level is below the <b>threshold</b> of <b>comb</b> generation. Moreover, the second comb has a concave envelope, which is different from the sech 2 envelope of the soliton comb. This is due to the frequency mismatch between the harmonics and the resonant frequency. We also find that the repetition rates of these two combs coincide, although two orthogonal resonant modes are characterized by different free spectral ranges...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experiments}} {{in the field of}} strong optomechanical interactions have focused on either structures that are simultaneously optically and mechanically resonant, or photonic crystal fibers pumped by a laser intensity modulated at a mechanical resonant frequency of the glass core. Here, we report continuous-wave (CW) pumped self-oscillations of a fiber nanostructure that is only mechanically resonant. Since the mechanism has close similarities to stimulated Raman scattering by molecules, it has been named stimulated Raman-like scattering. The structure consists of two submicrometer thick glass membranes (nanowebs), spaced by a few hundred nanometers and supported inside a 12 -cm-long capillary fiber. It is driven into oscillation by a CW pump laser at powers as low as a few milliwatts. As the pump power is increased above <b>threshold,</b> a <b>comb</b> of Stokes and anti-Stokes lines is generated, spaced by the oscillator frequency of similar to 6 MHz. An unprecedentedly high Raman-like gain of similar to 4 x 10 (6) m(- 1) W- 1 is inferred after analysis of the experimental data. Resonant frequencies as high as a few hundred megahertz are possible through the use of thicker and less-wide webs, suggesting that the structure can find application in passive mode-locking of fiber lasers, optical frequency metrology, and spectroscopy.

40|$|To the {{complication}} {{and uncertainty}} in coal seam floor water-inrush monitoring, Internet of Things (IoT) perception {{is applied to}} the monitoring and controlling of coal seam floor water inrush with major impacting factors analyzed, and an open distribution information processing platform is constructed based on IoT-GIS coupling perception. Then using the platform to comprehensively perceive various floor water inrush impacting parameters, an AHP model is established. At this stage, by means of weight reasoning algorithm based on dynamic Bayesian network, the AHP weight can be worked out using the two-way probability transfer and chain rules. Then the multiple factors are spatially fused by GIS to form a non-linear mathematical model for the calculation of the water inrush relative probability index. After that, the discrimination <b>threshold</b> of the <b>comb</b> graph for the floor water inrush relative probability index is used to further identify the floor water inrush mode. The experiments in 10 # Coal Seam of Suntuan Mine show that, the accuracy perceived the floor water inrush is above 92 %, and the platform of IoT-GIS coupling perception has the obvious technical advantage than traditional monitoring technology. Therefore, it has has demonstrated strong systematic robustness, important theoretical and application significance...|$|R
