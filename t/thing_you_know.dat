The scar symbolized Todd's [...] "second rape of Marty", and was considered [...] "a poetic nod" [...] to Todd's history. The scar was significantly smaller than the original but placed in the same spot; it was gone by January 2009. St. John stated, [...] "I know. It's too bad. I honestly {{have no idea why}} they wouldn't keep that reminder on Todd's face.

Hutchins said [...] "I offered him options and, in some cases, multiple choices. We agreed to meet at the Warner Bros. gate near the water tower in 20 minutes."

500|$|American vocalist Barbra Streisand {{recorded}} her {{own version}} of [...] "Jubilation" [...] for her sixteenth studio album, ButterFly (1974). Despite Anka's original version totaling six minutes and 29 seconds, Streisand's is considerably shorter at three minutes and 52 seconds. On Anka's self-written book My Way: An Autobiography, he wrote that {{he was surprised to}} learn that Streisand's then-boyfriend Jon Peters was the one who produced the track: [...] "Peters was still her hairdresser. Next <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> he's her producer, and he's produced mega motion pictures". However, he also acknowledged Streisand's rendition: [...] "Barbra can sing the phone book. She has no problem singing anything. She's got one of the great voices". For an album review on Billboards [...] "Top Album Picks" [...] column in their weekly magazine, a critic listed Streisand's version of [...] "Jubilation" [...] as one of the [...] "best cuts" [...] on ButterFly.|$|E
500|$|Wilson's and Love's working {{relationship}} was briefly reestablished for the follow-up single [...] "Good Vibrations". [...] Wilson {{said that before}} its final mixdown, he had been confronted with resistance by unnamed members of the group. The subject of their worries and complaints was the song's length and [...] "modern" [...] sound: [...] "I said no, it's {{not going to be}} too long a record, it's going to be just right. ... They didn't quite understand what this jumping from studio to studio was all about. And they couldn't conceive of the record as I did. I saw the record as a totality piece." [...] Love was worried that the [...] "track itself was already so avant-garde, especially with the theremin, [...] I wondered how our fans were going to relate to it." [...] Shortly before the single's release, Wilson suggested: [...] "It's still sticking pretty close to that same boy-girl <b>thing,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> but with a difference. And it's a start, it's definitely a start." ...|$|E
500|$|Complications in Mercedes' {{relationship}} with Malachy occurred when she begins {{an affair with}} Calvin Valentine (Ricky Whittle) while working with him at The Loft. Metcalfe expressed that she had initial [...] "reservations" [...] about the storyline which she felt was [...] "far-fetched", adding that once she had begun filming the scenes she thought the plot was [...] "brilliant" [...] even though she felt Mercedes would {{be perceived as a}} [...] "bitch". Whittle expressed similar doubts, saying he felt it was [...] "a bit out of character" [...] for Calvin, although he felt the plot was [...] "exciting". At first the pair did not like each other, but after spending time together, they realised that there was more to their personalities than they initially thought. Whittle explained that the attraction between Mercedes and Calvin began [...] "building", to the point that she and Malachy have [...] "a massive row" [...] and Calvin comforts her; Whittle stated that [...] "the next <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> they’re tearing each other’s clothes off".|$|E

500|$|The {{first version}} of [...] "Your Love" [...] {{appeared}} on Minaj's unofficial mixtape Barbie World (2010), with different lyrics included in the pre-chorus along with a faster pace. Another version was later stolen and leaked online. The song underwent minor lyrical adjustments and mixing before being sent to mainstream radio, as the first official single from Minaj's debut album Pink Friday (2010). In an interview with Hot 93.7 radio, Minaj spoke about the leak of the song, saying [...] "That was a leak and I was so upset they put it out 'cause I recorded that song like two years ago. Next <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> people started {{falling in love with}} it." [...] Whilst on set on the music video for [...] "Your Love", Minaj further explain about the song's theft and leak, saying, [...] "I was not planning on putting the song out at all. But then I heard it one day, somebody told me it was online. And I was like, 'No way, no way in the world that song is out.' I went and listened to it and was really upset. It wasn't mixed, it wasn't finished, it wasn't anything — I wasn't gonna use it at all. But then radio started playing it." ...|$|E
500|$|In a July 1966 {{advertisement}} for Pet Sounds in Billboard magazine, the band thanked {{the music industry}} for the sales of their album, and said that [...] "We're moved {{over the fact that}} our Pet Sounds brought on nothing but Good Vibrations." [...] This was the first public hint of the new single. Later in the year, Brian told journalist Tom Nolan that the new Beach Boys single was [...] "about a guy who picks up good vibrations from a girl" [...] {{and that it would be}} a [...] "monster". He then suggested: [...] "It's still sticking pretty close to that same boy-girl <b>thing,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> but with a difference. And it's a start, it's definitely a start." [...] Derek Taylor, who had recently been engaged as the band's publicist, is credited for coining the term a [...] "pocket symphony" [...] to describe the song. In a press release for the single, he stated: [...] "Wilson's instinctive talents for mixing sounds could most nearly equate to those of the old painters whose special secret was in the blending of their oils. And what is most amazing about all outstanding creative artists is that they are using only those basic materials which are freely available to everyone else." ...|$|E
500|$|When Mitzeee {{realised}} Mercedes was her stalker, Mercedes knocked Mitzeee {{out after}} Mitzeee tries to stab her. Mercedes realised {{that she will}} be blamed for stalking Mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people Mitzeee was mad. Metcalfe said the situation was born through [...] "pure desperation". She said that [...] "the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was too much for her to take, and she just saw red. I don't think it's something that Mercedes thought about or planned - she wouldn't have even dreamed of doing it to herself. But at the time, she saw it as the only way out of the situation". Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says something that makes Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked. Mitzeee is petrified and picks up a knife in the kitchen. The next <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> Mitzeee wakes up after being unconscious [...] The first thing she sees is Mercedes with a stab wound and there is blood everywhere. Mitzeee doesn't have a clue whether she could have stabbed Mercedes, or if someone else came into the flat and did it".|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{nominated}} for Best Metal Performance at the 49th annual Grammy Awards. When asked for his thoughts on the nomination, King revealed {{that he did not}} [...] "even care", and noted that Slayer fans [...] "don't give a shit and that's {{the most important thing to}} me". The interviewer expressed his surprise at the nomination given Slayer's [...] "inflammatory" [...] lyrics, to which King replied, [...] "That would be the coolest <b>thing,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> To win with the shit we write about." [...] The ceremony was held on February 11, 2007, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, with Slayer competing against Mastodon, Lamb of God, Ministry and Stone Sour. Slayer won the Best Metal Performance Grammy award, although the band was unable to attend because of a conflicting North American headlining tour. Araya commented about the win from a hotel room in Columbus, Ohio: [...] "Jeff [...] and I put a lot into 'Eyes of the Insane' so we're thrilled that the Grammy voters took the time to listen to it, and then vote for it. We're out here on the road and we're all really, really happy." [...] King disagreed, deeming the song [...] "one of the poorest representations of us [...] on the record [...] ". He further said that, if given the decision, he would have chosen the controversial track [...] "Jihad" [...] to represent Slayer from their ninth album Christ Illusion. Critical of the Recording Academy, King said, [...] "Realistically, I think people on the academy who vote pick the household name ... And that's what we are." ...|$|E
500|$|The third single [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] {{features}} Flavor Flav as {{the lead}} MC. He was given the idea by Chuck D to write the song. As Flav recalled, [...] "I went and got high and wrote the record. I went and got ripped, I went {{and got out of}} my mind, and I started speaking all kinds of crazy shit 'cos usually {{back in the days when}} I used to smoke, it used to broaden my ideas and everything". The humorous and satirical subject matter is reflected in its music video, which featured a severely injured Flav being mistreated by a remiss, overdue ambulance staff. Another Flavor Flav-solo track, the fifth single [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man", has lyrics advocating African-American self-reliance and denouncing welfare dependence. It also reflects on Flav's experiences with acquaintances from poor neighborhoods. He said of his inspiration for the song, [...] "I was in my Corvette riding from Long Island going to The Bronx. I was slipping. I was roasting. I mean I was smoked-out crazy. And everybody kept asking me for stuff and yet nobody wanted to give me stuff. So then if anybody ever asked me for something I would be like, 'Yo, I can't do nothing for ya man.' Next <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> I started to vibe on it: 'I can't do nothing for ya man,' um ahh um um ahh. So I went and told that to Chuck. Chuck was like, 'Record that shit man'". Writing of both tracks, music critic Tom Moon comments that Flav [...] "affects a tone of gimme-a-break sarcasm that is crucial to both tracks, and is welcome respite from Chuck D.'s assault". [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man" [...] was featured in the 1990 comedy film House Party.|$|E
