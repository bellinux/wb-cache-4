After winning $500,000, enough to surpass Rutter's total, Jennings chose not to attempt the final $1,000,000 question, which would have deducted $475,000 from his winnings if he missed it. As is customary on the show, Jennings was then shown the question <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have happened, and he provided the correct answer. Had he risked his winnings and correctly answered the question, he would have become the show's second $1,000,000 winner.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the high}} points of Lynch's first term as Taoiseach, and {{possibly}} {{one of the most}} important events in modern Irish history, was Ireland's entry into the European Economic Community. Lynch personally steered the application for membership and the acceptance of membership by a five to one majority in a referendum shows that the vast majority of the country was behind him. Ireland officially joined, along with its nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom and Denmark, on 1 January 1973. Patrick Hillery became Ireland's first European Commissioner. In appointing Hillery Europe was gaining one of Ireland's most experienced politicians, while on the other hand Lynch was losing one of his staunchest allies. The admittance of Ireland was the culmination of a decade of preparation which was begun by Lynch and his predecessor, Seán Lemass, who unfortunately did not live <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have been his greatest achievement.|$|E

25|$|Network Externality {{positively}} {{affects the}} cultural commons in many ways. The reward for {{being part of}} a group, society, and even the world through a P2P network {{is one of the greatest}} benefits that a modern common-pool resource can provide.The ability to connect and create with people from different cultures, ethnicities, and beliefs is something thought to be impossible 100 years ago. Without network externality this form of communication would have been impossible. Through P2P sharing the world as a culture are able to learn and teach each other through public forums. In Sugata Mitra’s Ted talk, “The child-driven education” he placed a computer in a third world town and left it there <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen. To his amazement children were able to quickly figure out how to use the computer and educate themselves on its inner workings. This example is a benefit to society for several reasons. The first is the relationship between Sugata Mitra and the P2P network which led him to place the computer in a third world town, along with the ability to present his findings on a public forum. Secondly, it is those who consumed his ted talk and benefited from the knowledge that those in third world countries just need a chance to learn and they will take it. This experiment as a whole brings the culture of the world together and connects us with those we thought impossible due to the P2P network and network externality that led individuals to the Ted talk.|$|E

Stewie then claims {{that he is not}} yet ready to kill Lois or take over the world, until the right time. Brian tells Stewie that hypothetical viewers would be angered by the simulation. Stewie counters by saying that at least the simulation didn't end like the final episode of The Sopranos, where it just cut to black mid-sentence. As Stewie is saying this, the scene cuts to black mid-sentence.|$|E

The Browns were a new team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and were set to begin play in 1946. Gatski, who {{was working in the}} mines after graduating from Auburn, hitchhiked to Bowling Green, Ohio for the team's training camp. He did not consider a football career a certainty, and returning to the coal mines where his father had died in an accident was a distinct possibility.

500|$|As the {{war began}} to wind down with Germany's {{surrender}} in May 1945, the team parlayed Brown's ties to college football and the military to build its roster. The first signing was Otto Graham, a former star quarterback at Northwestern University who was then serving in the Navy. The Browns later signed kicker and offensive tackle Lou Groza and wide receivers Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie. Fullback Marion Motley and nose tackle Bill Willis, two of the earliest African-Americans to play professional football, also joined the team in 1946. Cleveland's first training camp took place at Bowling Green University in northwestern Ohio. Brown's reputation for winning notwithstanding, joining the team was a risk; the Browns and the AAFC were nascent entities and faced tough competition from the NFL.

500|$|Gaiman {{suggested}} they make an episode which centres on the TARDIS itself, {{which was not}} done before for the entire series since it began in 1963. The original plan focused {{on the idea of}} the Doctor being pursued by an enemy inside the TARDIS, but went through several subsequent changes; Gaiman changed the plan to focus on the companion due to the Doctor's knowledge of his ship making it too easy for him to escape his enemy, made the TARDIS the threat rather than just a specific alien to avoid making it a simple 'cat-and-mouse' game, and then included the idea of Idris to account for what happened to the TARDIS's mind during this attack. The central idea was a [...] "what if" [...] scenario <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen if the Doctor and the TARDIS got to talk together. Head writer Steven Moffat liked the idea of featuring the TARDIS as a woman, believing this to be the [...] "ultimate love story" [...] for the Doctor.|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, Tresham again urged Catesby and Wintour to abandon the scheme, but his attempts were in vain.

500|$|Despite this assessment, {{the end of}} the show's {{fourth season}} saw Hahn grow closer to {{orthopedic}} surgeon Callie Torres, in a relationship dubbed [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes has stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry. And watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." [...] She has explained that in developing the relationship between the two: [...] "we wanted it to be real– not some stunt to get people talking. [...] We wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman." [...] The two characters shared a kiss at the end of season finale, with which After Ellen have noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." ...|$|E
500|$|Teach had at some stage learnt of {{the offer}} of a royal pardon and {{probably}} confided in Bonnet his willingness to accept it. [...] The pardon was open to all pirates who surrendered on or before 5September 1718, but contained a caveat stipulating that immunity was offered only against crimes committed before 5January. [...] Although in theory this left Bonnet and Teach {{at risk of being}} hanged for their actions at Charles Town Bar, most authorities could waive such conditions. [...] Teach thought that Governor Charles Eden was a man he could trust, but to make sure, he waited <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen to another captain. [...] Bonnet left immediately on a small sailing boat for Bath Town, where he surrendered to Governor Eden, and received his pardon. [...] He then travelled back to Beaufort Inlet to collect the Revenge and the remainder of his crew, intending to sail to Saint Thomas Island to receive a commission. [...] Unfortunately for him, Teach had stripped the vessel of its valuables and provisions, and had marooned its crew; Bonnet set out for revenge, but was unable to find him. [...] He and his crew returned to piracy and were captured on 27September 1718 {{at the mouth of the}} Cape Fear River. [...] All but four were tried and hanged in Charles Town.|$|E

This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." [...] Before continuing with the storyline, the show's producers consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to ensure they maintained realism throughout. Trish Doolan, star of April's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place, and surmised that; [...] "They were really wanting to be truthful to the two characters they're focusing on in the woman-woman relationship", with Nikki Weiss, who also consulted, adding: [...] "they didn't want to stereotype anything either, and write from a place where they didn't understand it. [...] I don't think they did it as a stunt to get people back to watching after the strike. I really think that they wanted to develop these two characters, and that you could see a closeness with them way before they ever decided any kind of— I think they just have a chemistry together, as actresses, too. You could tell that in the room. They definitely have a chemistry." ...|$|E

Quinlan told Inside Soap journalist, Steven Murphy, that Lynsey is [...] "looking pretty good when she turns up" [...] and she would eventually end up [...] "hopping into the tub and dragging Gilly in there fully clothed!" [...] Hassan said that she found the scene in which Lynsey pulled Gilly into the hot tub [...] "embarrassing", despite knowing Quinlan well. She added that the scenes were not romantic to film due to the water being cold. Lynsey and Gilly later arranged a date together, which prompted Gilly to remove his wedding ring.

2500|$|Myths {{are rated}} as [...] "Busted" [...] when the myth's results cannot be {{replicated}} under either the described parameters or reasonably exaggerated ones.

[...] This is also commonly referred to in the series as [...] "the MythBusters way", and often reveals that the circumstances required to accurately recreate a 'Busted' myth are physically impossible or highly unlikely to occur with the scientific facts presented, or the equipment used in the myth used to gain the results is neither available to the general public, nor capable of producing the results. For example, when trying to see if diamonds can be made with a microwave, and the myth is busted, the team will arrange with an expert to have diamonds created with a large quantity of explosives.|$|E
