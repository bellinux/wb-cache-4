Thirdly, the author will address the specific "Islamic" factor of <b>the</b> <b>conflicts,</b> which was denied by Southeast Asian governments as being among the features of <b>the</b> <b>conflicts,</b> <b>and</b> propose a more appropriate approach to it in order to reduce the intractability of <b>the</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Copyright (c) 2014 by SDI.

5|$|All three ships {{served in}} the Active Squadron for {{the first decade of}} their careers, which proved to be uneventful. They were {{transferred}} to the Reserve Squadron in 1905, and by the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War in 1911, they were serving as training ships. They provided fire support to Italian troops fighting in Libya during <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> took part in the seizure of several Ottoman ports, including Tripoli. During World War I, Sardegna was used as a guard ship in Venice, while Re Umberto served as a floating battery in Brindisi and Sicilia was reduced to a depot ship. All three ships survived the war and were broken up for scrap in the early 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Around 120,000 {{men were}} mobilised during <b>the</b> <b>conflict,</b> <b>and</b> of these about 3,500 were killed. In the end, the victorious {{imperial}} faction abandoned its objective to expel foreigners from Japan and instead adopted {{a policy of}} continued modernization {{with an eye to}} eventual renegotiation of the Unequal Treaties with the Western powers. Due to the persistence of Saigō Takamori, a prominent leader of the imperial faction, the Tokugawa loyalists were shown clemency, and many former shogunate leaders and samurai were later given positions of responsibility under the new government.|$|E
5|$|As Italy {{entered the}} war at the {{conclusion}} of the Battle of France, their Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini looked to Africa as a possible location for easy propaganda victories to justify his joining <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> to glorify Italy's hitherto speculative role it. The British Somaliland colony, a weakly defended area located in modern Somalia, looked to the dictator easy prey. Despite Italy being logistically unready for a conflict in that region, an attack on Somaliland was authorized, set for late 1940. Italian forces in East Africa were relatively strong in numbers, if not in quality, with 29 colonial brigades, each consisting of several infantry battalions and some light artillery, concentrated around the recently conquered Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. The Italians also possessed at least 60 medium and light tanks and 183 aircraft, both fighters and medium/light bombers.|$|E

5|$|As {{this was}} happening, General Dean arrived {{south of the}} town with Lieutenant General Walton Walker to observe <b>the</b> <b>conflict,</b> <b>and</b> the final {{elements}} of the 34th leave Chonan. Dean ordered the 34th Infantry Regiment to retreat to the Kum River. 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry, now down to 175 men, had lost two thirds of its strength in Chonan, around 350 men. Most of the battalion's heavy equipment including mortars and machine guns were also lost. The North Korean radio reported 60 Americans were taken prisoner in the town. The regiment began its retreat in the late afternoon, with North Korean forces moving on ridges parallel to the regiment. Most of the battalion moved out on foot and by truck, resting {{on the evening of}} July 8 before arriving at the Kum River July 9 and setting up new defensive positions.|$|E
5|$|By November 1987, Castro began {{spending}} {{more time on the}} Angolan Civil War, in which the Marxists had fallen into retreat. Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola. Castro was angered by Gorbachev's approach, believing that he was abandoning the plight of the world's poor in favor of détente.|$|E
5|$|Civil {{war broke}} out across England in 1642 between the {{supporters}} of King Charles I and Parliament. Fortifications and artillery {{played an important role}} in <b>the</b> <b>conflict,</b> <b>and</b> most of the Device Forts saw service. The south and east of England were soon largely controlled by Parliament. The blockhouses at Gravesend and Tilbury were garrisoned by Parliament and used to control access to London. The castles along the Sussex and Kentish coastline were seized by Parliament in the opening phase of the war, Camber Castle then being decommissioned to prevent it being used by the enemy, the remainder continuing to be garrisoned. The royal fleet, which had been positioned in the Downs anchorage, sided with Parliament.|$|E

She was used as a repatriation transport after the war, making nine trips to bring some 40,000 Japanese soldiers and civilians to Japan from overseas locations.

5|$|During World War II, {{detailed}} invasion {{plans were}} {{drawn up by}} the Germans, but Switzerland was never attacked. Switzerland was able to remain independent {{through a combination of}} military deterrence, concessions to Germany, and good fortune as larger events during the war delayed an invasion. Under General Henri Guisan central command, a general mobilisation of the armed forces was ordered. The Swiss military strategy was changed from one of static defence at the borders to protect the economic heartland, to one of organised long-term attrition and withdrawal to strong, well-stockpiled positions high in the Alps known as the Reduit. Switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> often mediated communications between the Axis and Allied powers.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War in the 1640s the old medieval {{walls were}} {{reinforced}} with modern earthwork bastions and an outlying fort, called a sconce. Worcester changed hands {{several times during}} <b>the</b> <b>conflict,</b> <b>and</b> {{after the war ended}} the newer fortifications were dismantled. During the 18th century the older medieval stone walls and gatehouses were sold and mostly destroyed: by the 20th century, few parts survived. Post-war archaeology in the 1950s and 1960s and construction work in the 1970s revealed previously hidden stretches of the wall, and in the 21st century plans have been drawn up to improve the conservation and maintenance of this historic monument.|$|E
