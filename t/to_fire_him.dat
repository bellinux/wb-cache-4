5|$|In May 2003, The New York Times {{reporter}} Jayson Blair {{was forced}} to resign from the newspaper after he was caught plagiarizing and fabricating elements of his stories. Some critics contended that African-American Blair's race was a major factor in his hiring and in The New York Times initial reluctance <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Director of {{photography}} Mark Irwin was fired during filming of Screams finale, {{a week before}} principal photography was to be completed. Upon review of the dailies, Craven found the footage was out of focus and unusable. Irwin was initially ordered to fire his camera crew. He retorted that if his crew were to be fired, they would also have <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>him.</b> The producers fired him and replaced him with Peter Deming, who finished the film.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Detours had become the Who, they had already found regular gigs, {{including}} at the Oldfield Hotel in Greenford, the White Hart Hotel in Acton, the Goldhawk Social Club in Shepherd's Bush, and the Notre Dame Hall in Leicester Square. They had also replaced Druce as manager with Helmut Gorden, with whom they secured an audition with Chris Parmeinter for Fontana Records. Parmeinter found problems with the drumming and, according to Sandom, Townshend immediately turned on him and threatened <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>him</b> if his playing did not immediately improve. Sandom left in disgust, but was persuaded to lend his kit to any potential stand-ins or replacements. Sandom and Townshend did not {{speak to each other}} again for 14 years.|$|E

50|$|Phillips {{was a major}} {{promoter}} of the music artist Spade Cooley. Beginning in 1942, {{he was the first}} to use the term Western swing. He and Cooley would later have a falling out, leading <b>to</b> Phillips <b>firing</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
5|$|Steve Burdick {{is a local}} {{television}} news anchor who keeps his homosexuality private. He and his lover are tested for HIV and both test positive. Burdick struggles to keep himself together as his lover's health declines. When his lover dies, Burdick breaks down {{on the air and}} announces the death and that he too is HIV-positive. Station managers want <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>him,</b> but his producer, Barbara Hudson, convinces the station that AIDS reportage is newsworthy and socially responsible. Burdick's pieces are tagged with a viewer discretion advisory. He continues to report until he begins to show symptoms of AIDS, at which time the station managers pull him off the air.|$|E
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is shocked when Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) yells at him, and is unsure {{how to handle the}} situation. Michael tries to assert his power over Stanley, by pretending <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>him,</b> but that only makes matters worse. The two eventually end up alone in the office. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) receives a warning about his job performance, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) is forced to wear her glasses, and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) buys Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) car.|$|E
5|$|The locals saw Meiklejohn as an outsider. He was {{foreign to}} Madison in his politics, social life, and personality. Dean Sellery and President Frank's {{professional}} relationship was untrusting and contemptuous, which extended to Meiklejohn {{due to his}} close association with Frank. Sellery {{had the support of}} the faculty, who were envious of the Experimental College advisers' arrangements for higher salaries. In objection to the college's reputation for radicalism, the son of the man who endowed Meiklejohn's professorship revoked his funding. Frank needed the donor's support, and so the incident marked Frank's waning support for the college. Sellery spoke out against the Experimental College {{in the first quarter of}} 1929, and Frank attempted <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>him</b> in response. In 1931, Sellery received letters from spies who found Meiklejohn's son Donald, a philosophy doctoral student at the university and a part-time Experimental College adviser, engaged in sex acts against university policy. Sellery pursued expulsion and denied Meiklejohn and his son's separate requests for a lesser punishment. A week later, Meiklejohn asked the advisers to close the college.|$|E

2500|$|Who was fired: Shane, for admitting in the {{boardroom}} that his chances of winning the competition were [...] "infinitely further away" [...] than he thought and for believing that Bill {{was not going to}} hire him, which led <b>to</b> Bill <b>firing</b> <b>him</b> for lack of commitment to the competition.|$|R
5000|$|For this task, Lord Sugar {{appointed}} Frances and Karthik {{as their}} respective team's project manager. Despite Karren feeling Frances had come {{off a bit}} unprofessional in the task, she {{was impressed with the}} sales her team achieved, with it noted that even without the boat sales, Nebula would still have won due to the combined sales of their accessories totalling over £2,000. In contrast, Claude was critical of Karthik's leadership, deeming him the sole reason for Titans' loss, effectively leading Lord Sugar <b>to</b> <b>firing</b> <b>him,</b> while asking Grainne and Dillon about who deserved to come back, eventually choosing the latter alongside Samuel and Alana.|$|R
5|$|As the Giants began 2011, many NFL analysts {{predicted}} that the Philadelphia Eagles were a favorite to win the NFC East title, while the Giants were not expected to make the playoffs. The Giants opened their regular season against the Washington Redskins on September 11, 2011, and lost in FedEx Field 28–14. The Giants then won three straight games, including breaking their six-game losing streak to Philadelphia. By Week 9, New York was 6–2 after beating the Patriots in Foxboro for their first encounter since Super Bowl XLII. At this point however, they entered a difficult stretch of games and lost four straight to a resurgent 49ers, followed by the Eagles, Saints, and Packers. By now, the Giants found their chances of beating Dallas to the division title fading and Tom Coughlin's coaching abilities were increasingly called into question despite reassurances from team president John Mara {{that there were no}} plans <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>him.</b> However, the Giants kept their playoff hopes alive in Week 14 by beating the Cowboys in Dallas on a last-second scoring drive led by Eli Manning and extending their win streak in Cowboys Stadium to three straight games. Despite another loss to the Redskins afterwards, the Giants defeated the New York Jets in Week 16 by a final score of 29-14, also eliminating the Eagles from playoff contention, to set up a rematch with the Dallas Cowboys in which the winner would win the NFC East. The game was later flexed into Sunday Night Football. The Giants beat the Cowboys 31–14 to win the NFC East with a record of 9-7. Throughout the regular season, Eli Manning (always viewed as a weak QB compared to his brother) put up some of the best stats of his career.|$|E
5|$|With The Legacy finally formed, Manu and Snuka {{still wanted}} revenge on Orton. Fearing {{they would try}} to {{convince}} Raw general manager Stephanie McMahon <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>him,</b> Orton went to speak to her himself but their conversation ended in an argument. When Vince McMahon, Stephanie's father, made his return that night Orton maintained he was owed an apology. His brashness angered McMahon who responded by trying to fire Orton, but before he could finish his sentence Orton slapped McMahon and gave him a running punt which left him hospitalized in the storyline. During the 30-man Royal Rumble match that Sunday the group worked as a team, making them three of the last four contestants in the ring with Triple H as the other. Ultimately, in throwing out Rhodes and DiBiase, Triple H was distracted enough to allow Orton to throw him over the top rope and win the match. The next evening on Raw, The Legacy came to the ring accompanied by lawyers and doctors, with Orton explaining his outburst against McMahon was a result of intermittent explosive disorder (IED) and threatened to sue the company and cancel WrestleMania XXV if he was fired, as winning the Rumble guaranteed him a championship match at WrestleMania. Instead he was booked for a no holds barred match with Vince's son, Shane, at No Way Out in February, which Orton won. The night after the event, they fought again until Orton punted Shane unconscious. Stephanie McMahon came to the ring to oversee her brother being carried away by the paramedics and shouted at Orton until he performed an RKO, his finishing move, to her.Triple H ran to the ring and chased away the group, standing over the body of Stephanie McMahon.The next week,Orton and The Legacy attacked Triple H.When Stephanie came out to stop The Legacy,Orton attacked and made out with her before hitting Triple H with a sledgehammer.|$|E
25|$|As Tim took a {{backseat}} on all tasks, Lord Sugar initially intended <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>him</b> for this, but {{changed his mind}} and instead appointed him to be the PM on the next task, after Tim promised to take on the role regardless of what that task would be.|$|E

O'Sullivan was elected Ullico's new chairman, replacing Georgine.|$|E
25|$|During this period, drummer Topper Headon {{escalated}} his {{intake of}} heroin and cocaine. His occasional drug usage had {{now become a}} habit that was costing him £100 per day and undermining his health. This drug addiction would be the factor that would later inspire his bandmates <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>him</b> from The Clash, following the release of Combat Rock.|$|E
25|$|Sharon {{initially}} {{refused to}} resign as defense minister, and Begin refused <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>him.</b> After a grenade {{was thrown into}} a dispersing crowd at an Israeli Peace Now march, killing Emil Grunzweig and injuring 10 others, a compromise was reached: Sharon agreed to forfeit the post of defense minister but stayed in the cabinet as a minister without portfolio.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, he has ventured," [...] responded Dechamp, [...] "and {{some one}} has ventured <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> at <b>him</b> {{with intent to}} kill. By good luck he was a bad shot. He missed the man, though he hit and killed the horse. But I shall find the rascal out before long--he may depend on that!" ...|$|R
50|$|Sellers had {{personally}} invited British cinematographer Larry Pizer {{to shoot the}} film, only <b>to</b> later <b>fire</b> <b>him</b> after a party once production had commenced. Sellers also fought on set with co-star Tony Franciosa. After the final scene was filmed, involving Sellers and Milligan both being physically restrained, the crew forced them {{to listen to a}} song detailing the production's woes.|$|R
60|$|Romata was so {{delighted with}} the success of this shot that he pointed to a man who was walking on the shore, and begged the captain <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> at <b>him,</b> evidently supposing that his {{permission}} was quite sufficient to justify the captain in such an act. He was therefore surprised, and not a little annoyed, when the captain refused <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> at the native and ordered the gun to be housed.|$|R
25|$|John Cazale as Stan ("Stosh"). All scenes {{involving}} Cazale, who had terminal cancer, were filmed first. Because of his illness, {{the studio}} initially wanted <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>him,</b> but Streep, {{with whom he}} was in a relationship, and Cimino threatened to walk away if they did. He was also uninsurable, and according to Streep, De Niro paid for his insurance because he wanted Cazale in the film. This was Cazale's last film, as he died shortly after filming wrapped. Cazale never saw the finished film.|$|E
25|$|Emilio Estevez {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of John Bender. However, when Hughes was unable to find someone to play Andrew Clarke, Estevez was recast. Nicolas Cage was considered {{for the role}} of John Bender, which was the last role to be cast, though the role was narrowed down to John Cusack and Judd Nelson. Hughes eventually cast Cusack, but decided to replace him with Nelson before shooting began, because Cusack did not look threatening enough for the role. At one point, Hughes was disappointed at Nelson because he stayed in character by harassing Ringwald off-camera, and the other actors had to convince Hughes not <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|On the November 27, 2008, Impact!, Shelley {{took part}} in the second annual Turkey Bowl, {{defeating}} Cute Kip and Consequences Creed in a three–way dance in the semifinals. In the finals Shelley faced the reigning X Division Champion Sheik Abdul Bashir and Rhino in another three–way dance where the winner would receive a check for $25,000, and the loser had to wear a turkey suit. Rhino won the match, pinning Shelley following a Gore forcing him to wear the suit. Shelley finally agreed to put on the suit after Mick Foley threatened <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>him</b> if he did not. After putting on the turkey suit Shelley gave Foley a middle finger and was laid out with a double arm DDT.|$|E

25|$|Mike Brearley {{announced}} his retirement from Test cricket after the Jubilee Test in Bombay and, somewhat surprisingly given his lack of captaincy experience, Botham was appointed to replace him as England's captain for the forthcoming home series against West Indies, {{who were at the}} time the world's outstanding team. Botham led England in twelve Tests in 1980 and 1981 but he was unsuccessful, the team achieving no wins, eight draws and four defeats under his leadership. In addition, his form suffered and was eventually dismissed from the post, although he did actually resign just before the selectors were about <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>him.</b> In Botham's defence, nine of his matches as captain were against West Indies, who afterwards won twelve of their next thirteen Tests against England. The other three were all against Australia.|$|E
25|$|Weeks later, on {{his first}} day back at the office, excited to see his story in print, Pabst arrives empty-handed and informs them the whole month's run of the {{magazine}} has been pulped, as the owner wouldn't publish a story featuring a black hero. Pabst tells Benny he is being forced <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>him</b> as well. Benny breaks down; he screams that although the world can deny him, they cannot destroy his ideas and the future he envisions is real. He collapses to the floor sobbing and is taken away by an ambulance. As he falls unconscious, he looks through the window and, rather than the city, sees stars streaking past. The preacher sits by him and tells him that he is both the dreamer and the dream. Sisko wakes up back on the station. He is deeply moved by his vision, and wonders if somewhere Benny Russell is dreaming of Deep Space Nine.|$|E
25|$|In December 1968, Imlach {{was asked}} by Stafford Smythe to give the {{coaching}} job to John McLellan, but Imlach refused and told Smythe <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>him</b> or leave him alone. During the season, Mike Walton walked out on the team, saying he wouldn't play for Imlach again. He returned about a week later. On April 6, 1969, minutes after an early and embarrassing playoff elimination {{at the hands of}} the Boston Bruins, Imlach was fired by the Leafs. He still had a year remaining on his contract, which paid him about $35,000 a year. In the dressing room after the announcement was made, veteran Leafs Johnny Bower and Tim Horton both said they would leave with Imlach (they both returned the following season, although neither would remain with the Leafs for long). Imlach's assistant, Clancy, had previously said that he would walk away if Imlach was fired, but he was persuaded to stay with the team. Jim Gregory was immediately announced as Imlach's replacement as general manager.|$|E
