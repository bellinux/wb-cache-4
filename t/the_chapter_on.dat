5|$|The {{layout of}} the book follows that of the earlier volumes, with the recipes grouped by subject. Each chapter has its own {{introductory}} essay, up to four pages in length, and within each chapter sub-sections also have their own preliminary essays; for instance, <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>on</b> meat has a two-page opening essay, with individual essays on beef, lamb, pork and veal before the recipes for each.|$|E
5|$|Deanesly and Grosjean's thesis was {{addressed}} and refuted by the textual research of Paul Meyvaert, following whose work most scholars {{have come to}} accept the Libellus as a genuine letter of Gregory. The only portion of the Libellus that Meyvaert could not accept as genuine was <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>on</b> marriage, which Meyvaert (like Boniface before him) believed {{could not have been}} written by Gregory. Meyvaert therefore pronounced this chapter to be the single interpolation in an otherwise genuine document. All subsequent scholarship up until the year 2008 has followed him on this point. In 2008 Ubl not only showed that the marriage chapter was in fact authored by Gregory, but he also explained exactly how it was the Boniface and later historians came to misunderstand its meaning.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{accounts}} of ancient versions were rewritten by distinguished scholars, who were leaders in their several departments. The early part of Volume I was enriched from the admirable book on “Greek and Latin Palaeography”, by Edward Maunde Thompson. Many corrections suggested by eminent scholars were introduced in different places throughout the book. H. J. White rewrote <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>on</b> Latin versions. G. H. Gwilliam, editor of the Peshitta, helped to improve the passages on the Peshitta and the Curetonian Version. H. Deane made an additions {{to the treatment of}} the Harkleian Version. A. C. Headlam made a revision of the long chapter on the Egyptian versions; F. C. Conybeare, rewrote the sections on the Armenian and Georgian versions; Margoliouth rewrote the sections on the Arabic and Ethiopic versions; J. M. Bebb rewrote the section on the Slavonic version; James W. Bright rewrote the section on the Anglo-Saxon Version.|$|E

5|$|At this time, {{unhappy with}} the way his {{collection}} The Round Table, issued in the same year, was being promoted by its publisher, he began to promote his new book himself, partly {{by word of mouth}} and also by getting a friend to publish <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>on</b> Hamlet in The Times and requesting Francis Jeffrey, editor of the Edinburgh Review, to notice it in that periodical. He had already had it printed privately (instead of offering it directly to a publisher) by his friend the printer Carew Henry Reynell, who purchased the copyright for £100. As a publicity tactic, copies were circulated privately. Finally, Hazlitt got the book published, by Rowland Hunter and the brothers Charles and James Ollier in collaboration, who brought it out on 9 July 1817. It was extremely successful, this first edition selling out in six weeks. A second edition was issued by Taylor and Hessey in 1818, and later that year an unlicensed edition was brought out in Boston by Wells and Lilly. No further editions appeared in Hazlitt's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} chapter, Stursberg recounts CBC's {{experience}} losing sports licenses. While the CBC had superior market placement (with respect to geographic coverage and experience with amateur sports), {{they lost the}} 2010 and 2012 Olympics to a joint CTV/TSN/Rogers $153 million bid. The Canadian Football League moved its broadcasting rights to TSN with Stursberg citing Commissioner Tom Wright's displeasure with the CBC's poor coverage of CFL games during the CBC 2005 lock-out. The CBC also lost broadcasting rights for The Brier and the Tournament of Hearts to CTV/TSN. Stursberg negotiated for Hockey Night in Canadas NHL rights with Gary Bettman and managed to extend their contract, but at a significantly higher price. The sixth chapter deals with CBC News which, as Stursberg explains, were scheduled to have the local newscasts eliminated. Instead, he initiated style and content reforms, taking effect in October 2009, including {{the creation of an}} internal newswire to provide stories suitable for TV, radio, and web services. He also commissioned an independent study to analyze a perceived anti-conservative bias in news coverage but the study found the coverage to be more conservative friendly than either the Global or CTV coverage. <b>The</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>on</b> Radio noted CBC Radio One's dominance in the Canadian radio market but CBC Radio Two's low ratings. Stursberg advocated for more local radio coverage, especially in the Hamilton area, and facilitated the programming change of CBC Radio Two by inserting more musical variety, specializing in Canadian music.|$|E

25|$|A second 1919 {{review by}} Arthur R. Burnet in the Publications of the American Statistical Association called the entire work a happy {{combination}} {{of theory and}} practical examples.

The forms are illustrated and can be followed in actual practice. <b>The</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>on</b> the examination of the plant preparatory to the installation of a cost system, according to Burnet in those days, contained a valuable checking list which should furnish statisticians with a wealth of suggestions for the analysis of business.|$|E

25|$|The N {{was famous}} for {{manufacturing}} its own steam locomotives, which were built at the Roanoke Shops, {{as well as its}} own hopper cars. In 1960, N became the last major class 1 railroad to end steam but didn't retire its last remaining Y class 2-8-8-2s until 1964 and 1965. By 1965, steam on class I railroads was gone but steam wasn't gone on class II railroads until 1974 and class III and mining railroads did not retire their steam locomotives from their active roster until 1983.

25|$|Few {{portrait}}s of Stuart survive. In 1770, Johann Zoffany painted {{her with her}} sisters, and this group portrait {{was used for the}} cover of Karl Miller's Authors (1989). A portrait of Stuart as a young woman by Mrs Mee is reproduced in James Home's Lady Louisa Stuart: Selections from her Manuscripts (1899) and is currently in the collection of Helen Storey, as is a locket containing a lock of her hair. An oil sketch of Stuart in 1851 by George Hayter was used to illustrate <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>on</b> her in Harry Graham's A Group of Scottish Women (1908), and was then in the collection of a Lieutenant-Colonel Clinton. A chalk sketch by J. Hayter dated 1837 is in a private collection.|$|E
25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was to close <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>on</b> that era. We played those songs {{so we can}} hopefully move forward and do new music that represents where we are now. When playing those songs, I thought, 'Here's a person {{at the time that}} I don't relate to anymore.' He didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world {{and a whole lot of}} other personal stuff that I won't get into. If I give myself to that, I can feel the psychological effects of that personality in the same way that an actor can say it wasn't healthy to live in that role so long or bring that role home every night.|$|E

25|$|Bloom {{consolidated}} {{his work}} on the western canon with the publication of How to Read and Why in 2000 and Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds in 2003. In the same year, Hamlet: Poem Unlimited was published, an amendment to Shakespeare: Invention of the Human written after he decided <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>on</b> Hamlet in that earlier book had been too focused on the textual question of the Ur-Hamlet to cover his most central thoughts on the play itself. Some elements of religious criticism were combined with his secular criticism in Where Shall Wisdom Be Found (2004), and a more complete return to religious criticism was marked by the publication of Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine in 2005. Throughout the decade he also compiled, edited and introduced several major anthologies of poetry.|$|E
25|$|Since its {{foundation}} {{as an independent}} successor state of the former Soviet Union, the Russian Federation had been engaged in a large legislative project of developing a new Civil Code. Part I of this new Civil Code of the Russian Federation {{was signed into law}} on November 30, 1994, by President Boris Yeltsin and became effective on January 1, 1995. In article 2, it situates the copyright law within the Civil law. Copyright legislation was originally planned to be included in part III of this new Civil Code. Several drafts for new chapters on copyrights were prepared, but the matter proved so difficult that part III of the Civil Code was delayed several times. It was finally adopted on November 26, 2001 without <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>on</b> intellectual property, which was postponed to part IV.|$|E
25|$|Finally, after Deleuze, René Girard {{included}} {{his account}} of sado-masochism in Things Hidden Since the Foundation of The World, originally Des choses cachées depuis la fondation du monde, 1978, making <b>the</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>on</b> masochism a coherent part of his theory of mimetic desire. In this view of sado-masochism, {{the violence of the}} practices are an expression of a peripheral rivalry that has developed around the actual love-object. There is clearly a similarity to Deleuze, since both in the violence surrounding the memory of mimetic crisis and its avoidance, and in the resistance to affection that is focused on by Deleuze, there is an understanding {{of the value of the}} love object in terms of the processes of its valuation, acquisition and the test it imposes on the suitor.|$|E
