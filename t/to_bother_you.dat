The album will double as the soundtrack to an independent feature film of the same title, written by and starring Boots, which will be [...] "a dark comedy with magical realism" [...] and will draw inspiration from his time spent working as a telemarketer. The first track of Sorry <b>to</b> <b>Bother</b> <b>You,</b> [...] "The Magic Clap", was leaked by the band themselves and posted below an article on August 13, 2012. The film's screenplay was published by McSweeny's in 2014.|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyway, your welcome's {{kind and}} I feel shabby because I'm forced <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> <b>you.</b> But suppose {{some of your}} {{customers}} arrive?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be off!" [...] said irritated BOB. [...] "Why come <b>you</b> here <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> one? <b>You</b> pharisaical old snob, You're wuss almost than t'other one! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{be quiet}} now, Leo," [...] she said impatiently. [...] "Can't {{you see that}} my hands are as full as I can manage, without my having <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> about <b>you</b> and your jealous tempers?" ...|$|R
60|$|Sir LUCIUS Why, you {{may think}} there's no being shot at without a little risk--and if an unlucky bullet should carry a quietus with it--I {{say it will be}} no time then <b>to</b> be <b>bothering</b> <b>you</b> about family matters.|$|R
6000|$|... "--and 'Pancakes.' I hate <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> <b>you,</b> but if {{you could}} send me [...] your {{autograph}} I should be more grateful than words can say. Yours [...] admiringly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} mean--Why did I come <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> <b>you</b> again? Well, the {{explanation}} {{will take some}} time, and it's confoundedly muddy and raining hard. When are you likely to be unoccupied?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, Krebs," [...] I said, [...] "I didn't {{come here}} <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> <b>you</b> about these matters, to tire you. I mustn't stay. I'll call in again {{to see how}} you are--from time to time." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY UTTERWORD [recollecting herself]. Oh, nothing. But he has {{no right}} <b>to</b> come <b>bothering</b> <b>you</b> and papa without being invited [she goes to the window-seat and sits down, turning away from them ill-humoredly and looking into the garden, where Hector and Ellie are now seen strolling together].|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{use would}} it be <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> yourself? <b>You</b> know she wouldn't see you--she'd shut the door in your face like she did before. She's an awful wicked woman--but it's kind of terrible {{to think of her}} lying there sick, with no {{responsible}} person to tend her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be off!" [...] said irritated Bob. [...] "Why come <b>you</b> here <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> one? [...] <b>You</b> pharisaical old snob, [...] You're wuss almost than t'other one! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sorry <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> <b>you,</b> Basil," [...] he gasped. [...] "I took a liberty--made an {{appointment}} {{here with a}} man--a client--in five minutes--I beg your pardon, sir," [...] {{and he gave me}} a bow of apology.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{talk about}} it again," [...] Jimmy replied. [...] "I suppose we must go, but now you're back, I don't want <b>to</b> <b>bother.</b> <b>You</b> brace me up. Until I heard your step, I felt down and out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm going <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> <b>you</b> {{with a few}} quotations, anyway. See here, I'll {{just run}} round to see you. My car is waiting at the door now. I won't keep you {{more than a few}} minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, don't you see {{how much}} more {{comfortable}} he must be?--nothing <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> him, <b>you</b> know; no bills coming due; and as for yourself, {{you should have a}} lease, say for five years, of any land you liked; say forty acres or so, and with your ready money you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|Clarke turned, {{the glare}} of madness in his eyes. [...] "Curse you and your reporters! Go away from me! I don't want <b>to</b> be <b>bothered</b> by <b>you</b> nor by them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When you're out in {{the open}} air and comfortable, it won't be fair <b>to</b> be <b>bothering</b> <b>you</b> with business. Come, governor, ten minutes will tell the whole of it if you'll only mind your eye. How did you begin with Sir Thomas?" [...] And then Aby went to the door, opened it very gently, and {{satisfied}} himself that there was nobody listening on the landing-place.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes when I hain't busy, I {{drop into}} the state library at the capital and enjoy myself. It's like goin' to another world without any folks <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> <b>you.</b> Er--er--there's books I'd {{like to talk to}} you about--sometime." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a {{very good}} sort, Sadie, and mean well; I'll go steady and try not <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> <b>you</b> again. But we won't say any more about it now. Are those new letters? The mail hadn't come when I left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'm going <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> <b>you</b> to {{stop for}} a moment at Mary Bascom's and give her a bouquet of my white lilacs. She loves 'em and I'm not going to wait till she's dead to send her flowers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} {{it is rather}} a <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> to leave your work," [...] she continued, [...] "but I am not {{offering}} you idle hospitality. I really want you to come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Julien," [...] she cried, [...] "this is delightful, meeting you! I hope I shan't be a <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{but really}} {{it is rather}} nice to feel that I have one friend here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Daisy Hyslop, then," [...] he continued, smiling, [...] "I {{suggested}} {{just now}} that I {{did not want}} <b>to</b> come and <b>bother</b> <b>you</b> for information without any return. If I can be of any assistance to you in that matter," [...] he added, glancing towards the envelope, [...] "I shall be very pleased." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] he said, smilingly. [...] "There isn't {{a bit of}} need <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> <b>you</b> with this. I don't suppose you'd {{understand}} these itemized bets, anyway. I lost the thousand dollars on the races. Good-day to you, gentlemen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{want to ask}} a great {{favor of}} you. I am ashamed <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> <b>you</b> in this way; but Mary might listen to what you said, if you {{mentioned}} the subject to her--I mean about my going into the Church." ...|$|E
6000|$|Charnock laughed. [...] "I {{imagined}} you {{had enough}} <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> <b>you,</b> and his account is big. We couldn't have paid him without going broke, and wages have first claim. There {{was a way}} out, but you had given me strict orders not to write to Sadie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] {{returned}} the hen. [...] "Don't let their condition make you unhappy, ma'am, because I'll soon have them crowding 'round <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> and worry <b>you</b> as naturally as ever. Come with me, if you please, and I'll {{show you how}} pretty they look." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, anyhow," [...] said Woot the Wanderer, [...] "Chopfyt, {{being kept}} a {{prisoner}} by his wife, {{is too far}} away from anyone <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> either of <b>you</b> tin men in any way. If you hadn't gone where he is and discovered him, you would never have worried about him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see how it}} {{can help}} making a difference," [...] he {{answered}} slowly. His excitement had cooled abruptly: he seemed dazed. At this moment my private stenographer entered to inform me that I was being called up on the telephone from New York. [...] "Well, you have more important affairs to attend <b>to,</b> I won't <b>bother</b> <b>you</b> any more," [...] he added.|$|R
6000|$|... "Taylor?" [...] {{the face}} said, forming into place. It {{was an old}} face, gray and grim. [...] "This is Moss. I'm sorry <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> <b>you</b> during Rest Period, but this thing has come up." [...] He rattled papers. [...] "I want you to hurry over here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] he answered. [...] "I {{have had}} a very curious cable from Dicky which I can't understand. I am sorry <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> <b>you,</b> but I think you had better come up to town by the first train in the morning. It's {{something}} to do with these Deloras." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I wouldn't!" [...] Seth cried passionately, {{the tears}} coming dangerously near his eyelids. [...] "I'd do {{anything}} in this world {{for the sake of}} havin' such a home as this; but all the same, Snip an' I can't stay <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> <b>you.</b> We'll leave when he comes back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{people think}} he ought <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> himself about <b>you</b> a little more. I don't--I {{understand}} him. He's a child in some ways himself--that's what he is, and needs some one to look after him {{as bad as you}} do. Well, perhaps he'll have some one before long, if all tales is true." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph! {{you make}} me tired," [...] sneered the rich young man. [...] "Go on, I don't want <b>to</b> be <b>bothered</b> with <b>you</b> any longer. The whole bunch of you is too namby-pamby for me. I think my sister and I could {{have a much better}} time if we weren't with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose {{you leave}} the thing to me? I saw the fellow coming here," [...] he said to Flora, and {{stopped in front of}} Peters. [...] "You haven't gone yet? I had some trouble to get rid of you before, and don't mean <b>to</b> be <b>bothered</b> by <b>you</b> again. This is the last {{annoyance}} you will give us." ...|$|R
