5|$|The land {{on which}} the Gateway was built on was {{previously}} a crude jetty, used by the fishing community which was later renovated and used as a landing place for British governors and other prominent people.

5|$|To avoid further wear of stairs' stones, since November 2014, {{two main}} {{sections}} of Borobudur stairs — the eastern (ascending route) and northern (descending route) sides — {{are covered with}} wooden structures. The similar technique has been applied in Angkor Wat in Cambodia and Egyptian Pyramids. In March 2015, Borobudur Conservation Center proposed further to seal the stairs with rubber cover. Proposals have also been made <b>that</b> <b>visitors</b> be issued special sandals.|$|E
5|$|FootTown's {{third and}} fourth floors house several tourist attractions. The third floor {{is home to the}} Guinness World Records Museum Tokyo, a museum that houses life-size figures, photo panels and memorabilia {{depicting}} interesting records that have been authenticated by the Guinness Book. The Tokyo Tower Wax Museum, opened in 1970, displays wax figures imported from London where they were made. The figures on display range from pop culture icons such as The Beatles to religious figures such as Jesus Christ. A hologram gallery named the Gallery DeLux, a lounge and a few specialty stores are also located on this floor. Tokyo Tower's Trick Art Gallery is located on the building's fourth and final floor. This gallery displays optical illusions, including paintings and objects <b>that</b> <b>visitors</b> can interact with.|$|E
30|$|Another {{important}} aspect {{is the effect}} of tourism on other parts of Japan. In the previous section, we reported <b>that</b> <b>visitor</b> consumption in Kyoto primarily stimulated the tertiary industries in that city. However, the direct effect results showed <b>that</b> numerous <b>visitors</b> from Taiwan, Korea, and especially China enjoyed shopping in Kyoto. This implies that imported goods from other parts of Japan were purchased by Kyoto <b>visitors,</b> which means <b>that</b> <b>visitor</b> consumption in Kyoto stimulated production activities in other parts of Japan, especially in the manufacturing industries.|$|R
25|$|Cost per action/sale methods require <b>that</b> {{referred}} <b>visitors</b> do {{more than}} visit the advertiser's website before the affiliate receives commission. The advertiser must convert <b>that</b> <b>visitor</b> first. It {{is in the best}} interest for the affiliate to send the most closely targeted traffic to the advertiser as possible to increase the chance of a conversion. The risk and loss is shared between the affiliate and the advertiser.|$|R

5|$|In week eight, in {{the early}} hours of Day 53, Tom voluntarily left the Big Brother House. For the {{shopping}} task the housemates split into two groups, creating human puppets with one housemate providing the head and feet and another providing the arms, and making them dance to music by Girls Aloud and Take <b>That.</b> <b>Visitors</b> to the Big Brother web site decided by voting that the housemates had failed the task. On Day 56, Noirin's ex-boyfriend Isaac entered the House, but left voluntarily shortly after Noirin's eviction on Day 58 with 60.0% of the public vote.|$|E
5|$|Stowe's house, {{which was}} {{located on the}} bank of the St. Johns River, became a tourist attraction, as riverboats {{shuffling}} tourists from Jacksonville to Palatka or Green Cove Springs passed close by and slowed, so the captains could point out her home to their clients. Eventually a dock was built so <b>that</b> <b>visitors</b> could come ashore and peek into the windows of the home. One, who dared to pull down a tree branch covered with orange blossoms in full bloom over the Stowe's veranda, was chased off the property by Calvin. Local residents who held Stowe in less than high regard insinuated that she worked with the enterprising riverboat captains to pose for tourists.|$|E
5|$|Works {{from her}} {{collection}} {{were given to}} Wheaton College in 1922 during her 50th-year reunion, including an oil sketch by Alix d'Anethan and a seascape by Alfred Stevens. She loaned her paintings to the Worcester Art Museum, and the Fitchburg Public Library was a beneficiary of photographs, prints, engravings, textiles, dishes, and furniture. She {{was involved in the}} placement of art at the library so <b>that</b> <b>visitors</b> to every department would have the opportunity to view the works of art, including European prints and rare engravings that span several centuries.|$|E
25|$|The cathedral, which {{generally}} receives no State funding, welcomes all, with a chapel {{for those who}} come simply to pray and a small fee for {{those who wish to}} sight-see. The Cathedral website mentioned in 2006 <b>that</b> <b>visitor</b> numbers had reached around 300,000 a year.|$|R
50|$|Website visitor {{tracking}} (WVT) is {{the analysis}} of visitor behaviour on a website.

5|$|On 3 May 1957, a {{group of}} citizens, {{including}} Otto Frank, established the Anne Frank Stichting {{in an effort to}} rescue the Prinsengracht building from demolition and to make it accessible to the public. The Anne Frank House opened on 3 May 1960. It consists of the Opekta warehouse and offices and the , all unfurnished so <b>that</b> <b>visitors</b> can walk freely through the rooms. Some personal relics of the former occupants remain, such as movie star photographs glued by Anne to a wall, a section of wallpaper on which Otto Frank marked the height of his growing daughters, and a map on the wall where he recorded the advance of the Allied Forces, all now protected behind Perspex sheets. From the small room which was once home to Peter van Pels, a walkway connects the building to its neighbours, also purchased by the Foundation. These other buildings are used to house the diary, as well as rotating exhibits that chronicle aspects of the Holocaust and more contemporary examinations of racial intolerance around the world. One of Amsterdam's main tourist attractions, it received a record 965,000 visitors in 2005. The House provides information via the internet and offers exhibitions that in 2005 travelled to 32 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.|$|E
5|$|The Birmingham Mail {{reported}} on 9 January that the programme had attracted {{an influx of}} tourists to the street, who wished to have their picture taken by the James Turner Street road sign. Police advised visitors to stay away. Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis Academy Foundry, a charity that runs a primary school in James Turner Street, subsequently said <b>that</b> <b>visitors</b> had disrupted activity at the school {{and that he was}} preparing a complaint for Ofcom. Shortly afterwards, he submitted a letter to the watchdog alleging that children had been subject to public harassment because of the programme, and that Ofcom's rules regarding the welfare of those under the age of majority had been breached. On 13 February, newspapers, including the Daily Mirror and Daily Star, reported the theft of the James Turner Street road sign from outside the school.|$|E

40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{globalisation}} and cultural convergence theory {{have been discussed}} in various research areas. Scholars agree that global consumer behaviour becomes increasingly homogenous. However, in tourism, there is still evidence <b>that</b> <b>visitor</b> markets are distinguished and segmented according to their nationality. This study argues that national borders have lost in significance to separate markets. By means of a correspondence analysis, this study provides evidence that European travel behaviour in Australia shows similar activity patterns. The findings highlight <b>that</b> country-based <b>visitor</b> segmentation has lost momentum...|$|R
50|$|Vendors {{are able}} to lure visitor traffic away from the {{affiliate}}.

50|$|When a {{consumer}} visits a web site, the pages they visit, {{the amount of}} time they view each page, the links they click on, the searches they make, and the things that they interact with, allow sites to collect that data, and other factors, to create a 'profile' that links to <b>that</b> <b>visitor's</b> web browser. As a result, site publishers can use this data to create defined audience segments based upon <b>visitors</b> <b>that</b> have similar profiles.|$|R

25|$|Despite {{and because}} of its popularity, the region is heavily {{protected}} to preserve the rural and natural character of the land.
