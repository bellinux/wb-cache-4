2500|$|It {{may have}} been during the Civil War that {{baseball}} secured its place as America's game. An army making a brief stop at a location could easily organise a game of baseball on almost any clear patch of ground, whilst cricket required a carefully prepared pitch. Baseball began to poach players and administrators {{from the world of}} cricket. Nick Young, who served for 25 years {{as the president of the}} National League, was originally a successful cricketer. It was not until the Civil War that he took up baseball because [...] "it looked like cricket for which his soul thirsted." [...] It has been suggested that the fast-paced quick play of baseball was more appealing to Americans than the technical slower game of cricket. This natural tendency toward baseball was compounded by terrible American defeats at the hands of a traveling English side in 1859, which may have caused Americans to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> never be successful at this English game. By the end of the Civil War, most cricket fans had given up their hopes of broad-based support for the game. Baseball filled the role of the [...] "people's game" [...] and cricket became an amateur game for gentlemen.|$|E

30|$|The {{qualifications}} {{given by}} respondents to the match between the education <b>that</b> <b>they</b> completed and their jobs are subjective. One may wonder whether {{different types of}} respondents would {{be better able to}} assess the quality of the match, such as officials from schools and employers. Education officials would be quite capable of indicating the intentions of the education programme in relation to performance in jobs {{that are part of the}} occupational field. We <b>think,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be less able to indicate the extent of the match with the requirements of actual jobs – less well, at any rate, than graduates could do for the jobs <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have. By analogy, employers should be able to indicate fairly well the requirements for certain jobs and their matching education programmes. Again, we doubt whether <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be better able than the young employees themselves to indicate to what extent the completed education programme is actually useful in the day-to-day performance requirements of the employees’ specific jobs. Our approach is therefore quite defensible and we use the perceived match between one’s education and one’s job as a measure for the demarcation of narrow and broad education programmes.|$|R
6000|$|Another form of {{infertility}} {{has been suggested}} by Professor G.J. Romanes as having aided in bringing about the characteristic infertility or sterility of hybrids. It is founded on the fact, already noticed, that certain individuals of some species possess what may be termed selective sterility--that is, while fertile with some individuals of the species they are sterile with others, and this altogether independently of any differences of form, colour, or structure. The phenomenon, in the only form {{in which it has}} been observed, is that of [...] "infertility or absolute sterility between two individuals, each of which is perfectly fertile with all other individuals;" [...] but Mr. Romanes <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> [...] "it would not be nearly so remarkable, or physiologically improbable, that such incompatibility should run through a whole race or strain."[63] Admitting that this may be so, though we have at present no evidence whatever in support of it, it remains to be considered whether such physiological varieties could maintain themselves, or whether, as in the cases of sporadic infertility already discussed, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> necessarily die out unless correlated with useful characters. Mr. Romanes <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> persist, and urges that [...] "whenever this one kind of variation occurs it cannot escape the preserving agency of physiological selection. Hence, even if it be granted that the variation which affects the reproductive system in this particular way is a variation of comparatively rare occurrence, still, as it must always be preserved whenever it does occur, its influence in the manufacture of specific types must be cumulative." [...] The very positive statements which I have italicised would lead most readers to believe that the alleged fact had been demonstrated by a careful working out of the process in some definite supposed cases. This, however, has nowhere been done in Mr. Romanes' paper; and as it is the vital theoretical point on which any possible value of the new theory rests, and as it appears so opposed to the self-destructive effects of simple infertility, which we have already demonstrated when it occurs between the intermingled portion of two varieties, it must be carefully examined. In doing so, I will suppose that the required variation is not of [...] "rare occurrence," [...] but of considerable amount, and that it appears afresh each year to about the same extent, thus giving the theory every possible advantage.|$|R

5000|$|The Wife's Lament in the Exeter Book {{uses the}} {{language}} of the comitatus to sharpen awareness of the conflict between the wife's claim on her lover, and the brotherhood-claims of the lord and his followers: In the words of the Wife's Lament, [...] "that man's kinsmen began to <b>think</b> in secret <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> separate us." [...] How typical this is of the medieval genre of the frauenlied - with the romantic theme of a woman being left by her husband because he needs to be with his liege lord - is however debatable. [...] Even in Anglo-Saxon England, if the Exeter Book contains few pieces featuring women or written from the female perspective, Beowulf by contrast has roles for women precisely in strengthening the cohesion and unity of the comitatus: thus the 'peace-weaver' Queen Wealtheow makes the normative claim that “Here each comrade is true to the other/loyal to lord, loving in spirit./The thanes have one purpose, the people are ready:/having drunk and pledged, the ranks do as I bid.”.|$|R
40|$|Family, a {{basic and}} irreplaceable {{institution}} presents above all an emotional environment, {{a sense of}} security, love and safety not only for a child but also for other family members. A child creates close relationships within the family not only with their parents but also with siblings. A relationship between siblings offers an emotional support, an opportunity to share both joys and worries but also cooperation and conspiracy against parents. Siblings can offer help in difficult times in life, {{on the other hand}} conflicts may arise between siblings and rivalry and jealousy appears. The birth of a child with a severe disability presents an enormous challenge for the parents but the effects of this situation on siblings have not yet been sufficiently described. This sibling relationship can be more emotional, has its specifics and unmistakable quality. This bachelor thesis is divided into a theoretical and a practical part. The first chapter focuses on family its functions, educational styles and current family trends. The second chapter is focused on disabilities, which are further divided into basic types, such as bodily, sensory, mental and combined. In the third chapter we focus more on a family with a heavily disabled child and we devote the last chapter to siblings, especially to those with a disabled sibling. The practical part aims to describe the situation of siblings of children with a severe disability and to find positive aspects of the situation. I also tried to find out what demands does the family put on these siblings and if these siblings show tendencies to pro-social behavior, especially in the area of interests, education and career. The practical part was done using qualitative research, namely the method of questioning. The technique used was a semi-constructed interview. The experimental research was conducted in April 2015. The selective sample included two groups of respondents. In the first group there were siblings of people with severe health disability; in the second were siblings of people who were intact, meaning a sample of common population. The results of the experimental part follow after every round of respondents' answers. It is clear from the results that siblings of people with severe disability have the same duties in the household as the siblings of the intact ones. However, higher demands are put on them, when it comes to taking care of their sibling. None of the respondents <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have had less duties had their sibling been healthy. The results of the research showed that siblings of people with severe disability have higher predispositions for such personality traits that increase the tendency to pro-social behavior. They display empathy, a sense of social awareness, they also "feel protective" of their sibling and they feel selfless and patient. The interests and hobbies of siblings of children with a severe disability do not differ from interests of siblings of children without it. It is the siblings of children with a severe disability, however, who spend their free time with their sibling. They also more often work as volunteers. This thesis could be most useful for parents and siblings of people with a severe disability, because it can help them find a different perspective on the matter it will be a feedback of a sort. The thesis can also be used by students, who are preparing to work in helping professions, because it will help them orient in the matter. It could also be used by people who work in helping professions. Last but not least, it could be used to create material concerned with this matter...|$|R
