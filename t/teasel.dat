5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is a diurnal feeder. According to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, {{the species}} {{is one of the}} strictest vegetarians in the bird world. It is mainly granivorous, but will occasionally eat insects, which are also fed to its young to provide protein. Its diet consists of the seeds {{from a wide variety of}} annual plants, often those of weeds, grasses, and trees, such as thistle, <b>teasel,</b> dandelion, ragweed, mullein, cosmos, goatsbeard, sunflower, and alder. However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries. It will eat at bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring Niger seed (commonly and erroneously called thistle seed).|$|E

60|$|But the Men of the Mountains {{were now}} bestirring themselves. They came creeping, lean and hairy, {{out of their}} {{mushroom}} houses. Some fetched water, some looped down over the brink by which the travellers had come up.

6000|$|But {{variation}} {{gives us}} {{only half the}} elements of the ultimate problem, even in the case of domestic kinds. For the other half, we must have recourse to human selection, which, by picking out for seed or breeding purposes certain specially favoured varieties, has produced at last all the purposive or intentional diversity between the different existing stocks or breeds. In these artificially produced domestic races we see everywhere special adaptations to man's particular use or fancy. The dray-horse has been fashioned for purposes of strength and sure-footedness in draught, the race-horse for purposes of fleetness in running. In the fox-hound, man has encouraged the special properties that tend to produce a good day's hunting; in the sheepdog, those that make for the better maintenance and safety of a herd. The cauliflower is a cabbage, with specialised and somewhat abortive flower-heads; the fuller's <b>teasel</b> is a sport of the wild form, with curved hooks specially adapted by a freak of nature for the teasing of wool. So in every case man, by deliberately picking out for breeding or seeding purposes the accidental variations which happened best to suit his own needs, has succeeded at last in producing races admirably fitted in the minutest particulars for the special functions to which they are applied. There appears indeed to be hardly any limit to the almost infinite plasticity and modifiability of domestic animals. 'It would seem,' said a great sheep-breeder, speaking of sheep, 'as if farmers had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect in itself, and then proceeded to give it existence.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 11. Some {{essential}} points {{respecting the}} flower I shall note, however, before ending. There is one large and frequent species of it {{of which the}} flowers are delicately yellow, touched with tawny red, forming {{one of the chief}} elements of wild foreground vegetation in the healthy districts of hard Alpine limestone.[26] This is, I believe, the only European type of the large Cape varieties, in all of which, judging from such plates as have been accessible to me, the crests or fringes of the lower petal are less conspicuous than in the smaller species; and the flower almost takes the aspect of a broom-blossom or pease-blossom. In the smaller European varieties, the white fringes of the lower petal are the most important and characteristic part of the flower, and they are, among European wild flowers, absolutely without any likeness of associated structure. The fringes or crests which, towards the origin of petals, so often give a frosted or gemmed appearance to the centres of flowers, are here thrown to the extremity of the petal, and suggest an almost coralline structure of blossom, which in no other instance whatever has been imitated, still less carried out into its conceivable varieties of form. How many such varieties might have been produced if these fringes of the Giulietta, or those already alluded to of Lucia nivea, had been repeated and enlarged; as the type, once adopted for complex bloom in the thistle-head, is multiplied in the innumerable gradations of thistle, <b>teasel,</b> hawkweed, and aster! We might have had flowers edged with lace finer than was ever woven by mortal fingers, or tasselled and braided with fretwork of silver, never tarnished--or hoarfrost that grew brighter in the sun. But it was not to be, and after a few hints of what might be done in this kind, the Fate, or Folly, or, on recent theories, the extreme fitness--and consequent survival, of the Thistles and Dandelions, entirely drives the fringed Lucias and blue-flushing milkworts out of common human neighbourhood, to live recluse lives with the memories of the abbots of Cluny, and pastors of Piedmont.|$|E

40|$|Invasive <b>teasels</b> (Dipsacus spp., Dipsacaceae) are {{widespread}} in the USA, being present in 43 states and listed as noxious in five. The cimbicid sawfly Abia sericea (Linné, 1767) is under evaluation as a potential agent for classical biological control of <b>teasels.</b> The host range, biology, and life history of this insect were studied under laboratory conditions and in common garden experiments from 2006 – 2010 at the Agricultural University of Plovdiv, Bulgaria {{in order to determine}} if this biocontrol candidate justified the expense of further testing under quarantine conditions in the USA. In the laboratory, potted plants from twelve plant species belonging to seven families were tested in choice tests of oviposition and feeding. Eggs were laid only on D. laciniatus and D. fullonum plants with only one exception, on Valeriana officinalis, although the larvae that hatched from the latter did not feed on that plant. Larval feeding was observed only on D. laciniatus, Knautia arvensis, and Scabiosa ochroleuca, all in the family Dipsacaceae, which has no species native to the New World nor any of economic importance. In common garden tests into which adults and third- and fourth-instar larvae were released in separate tests, eggs were laid and larvae fed only on D. laciniatus. The results of these experiments indicate that A. sericea has a narrow host range, most likely limited to Dipsacus species, and a few other Dipsacaceae and that further pre-release studies in a US quarantine are warranted...|$|R

50|$|Fuller's <b>teasel</b> (the {{cultivar}} group Dipsacus fullonum Sativus Group; syn. D. sativus) {{was formerly}} {{widely used in}} textile processing, providing a natural comb for cleaning, aligning and raising the nap on fabrics, particularly wool. It differs from the wild type in having stouter, somewhat recurved spines on the seed heads. The dried flower heads were attached to spindles, wheels, or cylinders, sometimes called <b>teasel</b> frames, to raise the nap on fabrics (that is, to tease the fibres). By the 20th century, teasels had been largely replaced by metal cards, which can be made uniformly and do not require constant replacement as the <b>teasel</b> heads wear. However, some people who weave wool still prefer to use teasels for raising the nap, claiming that the result is better; in particular, if a <b>teasel</b> meets serious resistance in the fabric, it will break, whereas a metal tool will rip the cloth.|$|E

50|$|Once {{the wool}} had been carded (to {{get rid of}} the tangles) and spun (both these {{processes}} could be done in the workpeople's own homes), it then required weaving.
