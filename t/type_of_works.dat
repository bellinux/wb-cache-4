The search starts from the Last Planner 4 system, develops its principles, functions and methods, then explores their applicability to designing and making, the primary <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> involved in project production systems. What differences in these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> make a difference for control?

40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} hypothesized that job characteristics {{are related to}} changes in personality in humans, but often personality models still omit effects of life experience. Demonstrating reciprocal relationships between personality and work remains a challenge though, as in humans, many other influential factors may interfere. This study investigates this relationship by comparing the emotional reactivity of horses that differed only by their <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Horses are remarkable animal models to investigate this question as they share with humans working activities and their potential difficulties, such as "interpersonal" conflicts or "suppressed emotions". An earlier study showed that different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> could be associated with different chronic behavioural disorders. Here, we hypothesised that <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> would affect horses' personality. Therefore over one hundred adult horses, differing only by their work characteristics were presented standardised behavioural tests. Subjects lived under the same conditions (same housing, same food), were {{of the same sex}} (geldings), and mostly one of two breeds, and had not been genetically selected for their current <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> This is to our knowledge {{the first time that a}} direct relationship between <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and personality traits has been investigated. Our results show that horses from different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> differ not as much in their overall emotional levels as in the ways they express emotions (i. e. behavioural profile). Extremes were dressage horses, which presented the highest excitation components, and voltige horses, which were the quietest. The horses' <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> was decided by the stall managers, mostly on their jumping abilities, but unconscious choice based on individual behavioural characteristics cannot be totally excluded. Further research would require manipulating <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Our results nevertheless agree with reports on humans and suggest that more attention should be given to work characteristics when evaluating personalities...|$|R

He creatively portrayed the fascinating motifs, colors and language of folk art in his works. He followed traditional manuscript paintings, Kalighat paintings, sakher handi, nakshi katha, pakha (hand fan) etc. and the techniques of their creation. At the same time, he brought some modern elements to folk art by analyzing and minimizing its forms and using primary and mixed colors simultaneously and tried to use it in a modern context. He was also deeply attracted towards the drawings of Kalighat painting for its minimization and lyrical properties.|$|E
