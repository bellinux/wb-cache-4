He was in second place going into the free skate. He won the free skate, landing a clean quadruple jump, {{but was unable to}} pull up to first overall, due to Daisuke Takahashi's twelve point lead after the short program. He went on to the 2007 Cup of China, where he won the short program with a score of 81.55, improving his personal best by almost thirteen points. He placed second in the free skate after falling on his quadruple jump, and finished second overall to Johnny Weir.|$|E

5|$|More recent {{analyses}} {{using different}} sets of anatomical data have since cast doubt on a dromaeosaurid classification for Balaur. In 2013, a larger analysis containing {{a wide variety of}} coelurosaurs found that Balaur was not a dromaeosaurid at all, but a basal avialan, more closely related to modern birds than to Jeholornithiformes but more basal than Omnivoropterygiformes. A study published in 2014 found Balaur to be sister to Pygostylia. An independent analysis using an expanded version of the original data set (the one that found Balaur to be a dromaeosaurid) drew a similar conclusion in 2014. In 2015, researchers Andrea Cau, Tom Brougham, and Darren Naish published a study which specifically attempted to clarify which theropods were close relatives of Balaur. While their analysis could not completely {{rule out the possibility that}} B. bondoc was a dromaeosaurid, they concluded that this result was less likely than the classification of Balaur as a non-pygostylian avialan based on several important bird-like features. Many of the presumed unique traits would in fact have been normal for a member of the Avialae. Typical bird features included the degree of fusion of the limb bones, the functional first <b>toe,</b> the first <b>toe</b> claw not being smaller than the second claw, a long penultimate phalanx of the third <b>toe,</b> a small fourth <b>toe</b> claw and a long fifth metatarsal.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} aimed to {{investigate}} the function of <b>toes</b> while running through comparing bound <b>toes</b> by external-manipulation with natural separate <b>toes</b> by evaluating kinematics and plantar pressure analysis. Methods: Seven habitually barefoot male runners participated in the running test under <b>toes</b> binding and non-binding conditions, and Vicon and Novel insole plantar pressure measurement were conducted synchronously to collect kinematics and foot loading. Results: Ankle kinematics showed larger non-significant range of motion in the frontal plane while running with <b>toes</b> non-binding. The medial forefoot had a smaller force time integral, and with hallux had a larger force time integral than those of running with <b>toes</b> binding, with significance level p < 0. 05. Conclusions: While no significance existed between bound and non-bound <b>toes</b> in kinematics, the medial forefoot had a smaller foot impulse and the hallux had a larger foot impulse for those with non-binding feet. This suggests that other functions such as the active gripping action of <b>toes</b> might be important for {{the efficiency of the}} foot windlass mechanism (the plantar fascia support), which would be beneficial for running performance improvement and foot injury prevention...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} normal gait, <b>toes</b> require {{to be in a}} rectus position during the propulsive phase. This requires a correct balance and sequence of activity of the intrinsic musculature of the feet. Alteration of this balance and sequence may lead to the development of claw <b>toes.</b> Atrophy of the lumbricals occurs in the development of claw <b>toes,</b> but it is not known if changes occur in any other intrinsic muscles, including flexor digitorum brevis. This study set out to investigate whether hypertrophic changes were evident in flexor digitorum brevis in feet with claw <b>toes.</b> Methods Four cadaver feet were investigated, two with rectus <b>toes</b> and two with claw <b>toes.</b> Flexor digitorum brevis was removed from each, and seven anatomically significant tissue sections from each muscle were routinely processed, cut and stained. One hundred and sixty muscle fibre cross sectional areas were measured from each section. Results The mean age of the donors was 81. 5 years, and three of the four were female. Results showed that the cross sectional area of fibres from feet with claw <b>toes</b> was 417 Î¼g 2 significantly greater (p 2. Conclusions Although this study has several limitations, preliminary observations reveal that flexor digitorum brevis muscle fibre cross sectional area is significantly reduced in feet with claw <b>toes.</b> This would indicate a relationship between muscle fibre atrophy of flexor digitorum brevis and clawing of the lesser <b>toes.</b> </p...|$|R
