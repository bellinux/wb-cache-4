5|$|The crew {{discover}} a wrecked Borg scout ship {{with a single}} survivor: a young Borg drone. Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) insists on treating the surviving Borg despite the concerns of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). On Picard's orders, the drone is confined and monitored by security forces at all times and is prevented from contacting <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> Collective. Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Lt. Commander Data assist Crusher in bringing <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> back to health. As they {{come to understand the}} workings of <b>the</b> <b>Borg,</b> La Forge and Data postulate an idea of using <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> drone as a weapon of mass destruction. By implanting an unsolvable geometric formula into his mind and returning him back to the Collective, the formula should rapidly spread (similar to a computer virus) and disable <b>the</b> <b>Borg.</b> Crusher is aghast at this suggestion, considering it equivalent to genocide, while Picard and the other senior crew deliberate on the ethics of this plan.|$|E
5|$|When Picard {{returns to}} the Enterprise, he discovers that {{survivors}} from <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> sphere have invaded the ship and are beginning to assimilate both the Enterprise and its crew. Once they have assimilated the ship, <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> plan {{to use it to}} attack and conquer Earth. Picard and a team attempt to reach engineering to disable <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> with corrosive coolant used in the warp core. The assault fails and Data is captured; he meets the Queen of <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> Collective, who attempts to turn him to her side. A frightened Sloane ambushes the captain, but he soon gains her trust and they escape the Borg-infested area of the ship by using the holodeck to create a weapon.|$|E
5|$|Through the Etherians, Voyager learns of {{an energy}} field being {{projected}} by a gigantic space station, the Forge, which is draining power and preventing repairs from being completed. To counteract {{the effects of}} the field, chief engineer B'Elanna Torres suggests the use of a rare substance called Isodesium, and the Hazard Team is sent on a stealth mission to the scavenger base to steal their supplies of Isodesium. However, the mission is a disaster: despite acquiring the Isodesium, one crewman is briefly captured and another team member is critically injured. As the team attempts to extract, Borg drones transport into the extraction point, killing another team member, capturing Lieutenant Foster and taking the Isodesium. In Foster's absence, Munro is made the team leader. Along with Seven of Nine, the team transports to <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> cube to retrieve the Isodesium. While on the cube, Munro is given the chance to rescue Foster from assimilation by <b>the</b> <b>Borg.</b> Matters are complicated when <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> corner the team, leveraging their freedom and the Isodesium for assistance against a number of Species 8472 on board, a race highly resistant to <b>the</b> <b>Borg.</b> Although successful, <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> attempt to assimilate the team; anticipating a double cross, however, Munro has Chang detonate an explosive in a sensitive part of the cube and the team escapes with the Isodesium in the chaos.|$|E

She has presented this modification {{as a gift to}} the android, hoping to obtain his encryption codes to the Enterprise computer. Although Picard offers himself in Data's place, the android refuses to leave. He deactivates the self-destruct sequence and fires torpedoes at the Phoenix, but they miss because Data has betrayed her. Data ruptures a coolant tank, and the corrosive substance fatally dissolves <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> Queen's biological components.|$|E
5|$|First Contact was the highest-grossing film on {{its opening}} weekend, making $92 {{million in the}} United States and Canada with an {{additional}} $54 million in other territories, combining a worldwide total of $146 million. Critical reception was mostly positive; critics including Roger Ebert considered it {{to be one of}} the best Star Trek films. <b>The</b> <b>Borg</b> and the special effects were lauded, while characterization was less evenly received. Scholarly analysis of the film has focused on Captain Jean-Luc Picard's parallels to Herman Melville's Ahab and the nature of <b>the</b> <b>Borg.</b> First Contact was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Makeup and won three Saturn Awards.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth season}} of Voyager {{introduces}} Seven of Nine (Seven) {{as a new}} crew member as she becomes separated from <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> collective after the crew help <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> to defeat Species 8472. Captain Kathryn Janeway mentors Seven and helps her to rediscover her individuality and her humanity. Kes leaves the vessel after her powers increase, but pushes Voyager ten years closer to home as she departs. B'Elanna Torres faces her Klingon heritage, while the Doctor confronts the rights of sentient holograms for the first time.|$|E

5|$|The game's single-player {{campaign}} {{consists of}} around 30 linear levels, divided up into eight distinct missions. Missions have different objectives, from retrieving a particular item and accessing computer systems, escorting a friendly character through hostile territory, or destroying vital ship and station components. Enemies come in multiple {{forms in the}} game, often as Star Trek species such as <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> and the Klingons. Each group of enemies uses a different means of attacking: most humanoid enemies are armed with weapons similar to the player, and will use cover and squad tactics to attempt to kill the player character. <b>The</b> <b>Borg</b> differ from this in that, instead of using squad tactics, they eventually adapt their personal energy shields {{to most of the}} player's weapons, slowly rendering the player's attacks useless as they advance. Other enemies may attempt to swarm the player and eliminate them with melee attacks.|$|E

5|$|Chakotay pleads their case, but Janeway {{decides not to}} help them. As Chakotay {{returns to}} Voyager on board a shuttle, the Co-operative use their telepathic link {{to force him to}} travel to <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> cube with Voyager in pursuit. Both Chakotay and an away team board the cube, and despite a firefight, he manages to reactivate the generator. This creates the new joint mind as expected, but also {{activates}} the cube, which begins powering up to attack Voyager. Chakotay and the away team are beamed back to Voyager as the Co-operative trigger the cube's self-destruct before it can endanger the Federation ship. The planet's inhabitants thank Voyager, but {{as a result of their}} actions, Chakotay later questions the morality of the Co-operative's motives with Janeway, as it connected many of the former Borg together in a new hive mind without consulting them.|$|E
5|$|Frakes {{believes}} that the main themes of First Contact—and Star Trek as a whole—are loyalty, friendship, honesty and mutual respect. This {{is evident in the}} film when Picard chooses to rescue Data rather than evacuate the ship {{with the rest of the}} crew. The film makes a direct comparison between Picard's hatred of <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> and refusal to destroy the Enterprise and that of Captain Ahab in Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick. The moment marks a turning point in the film as Picard changes his mind, symbolized by his putting down his gun. A similar Moby-Dick reference was made in , and although Braga and Moore did not want to repeat it, they decided it worked so well they could not leave it out.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Elite Force, Wildstorm {{published}} a graphic novel based on Raven Software's story. The graphic novel was released in July 2000 as part of a Star Trek: Voyager graphic novel series produced by Wildstorm, written by British comic book authors Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. The book's artwork was produced by Jeffrey Moy and W.C. Carani. The book follows a broadly similar storyline to that of the game, predominantly focusing on USS Voyager being trapped by the Forge, which is controlled by an ancient race, the Tarlus, for the purpose of creating an army to conquer the galaxy. The Elite Force graphic novel focuses on a limited number of the Hazard Team, and does not expand on the plot points created by the Etherians and the scavengers in the game, instead using <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> to fill in these roles.|$|E

5|$|After {{competing}} in a bat'leth tournament {{on the planet}} Forcas III, Lieutenant Worf returns to the Enterprise and is treated to a surprise birthday party, much to his annoyance. As he attends the party, he starts to notice subtle changes, such as {{the flavor of the}} cake changing, and a painting given to him by Data appearing on a different wall. The changes start to become more pronounced; as a Cardassian vessel attacks the Enterprise, unfamiliar controls result in Worf failing to raise the shields, leading to the death of Geordi La Forge. Despite retaining his initial memories, Worf has no evidence that reality has changed, and his own personal logs support the stories given by the other crew members. Other major changes occur: Riker is Captain of the Enterprise in a reality wherein Picard was killed by <b>the</b> <b>Borg,</b> the Bajorans became the oppressors of the Cardassians and enemies of the Federation, Wesley Crusher is a lieutenant on the Enterprise, Alyssa Ogawa is the Chief Medical Officer, and Worf finds himself married to Deanna Troi.|$|E
5|$|An away team boards the cube, {{discovering}} that either {{an accident or}} another species disabled the vessel.

After being told by Frazier to remain where he is, Chakotay breaks {{out of his room}} where he sees that all the people around him on the alien planet possess Borg implant technology in their bodies. Frazier explains that an electro-kinetic storm broke their link with <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> hive mind. Instead, the separated drones settled on a nearby planet. Chakotay's health gets worse, and the ex-Borg offer to connect him to a joint mind to heal his injuries, and he reluctantly accepts. Once part of the hive mind, he sees a montage of their memories. After Voyager arrives, Frazier and her group want Janeway to re-activate the neuroelectric generator on the damaged cube to extend a new joint mind across the entire planet.|$|E

Neelix (Ethan Phillips) returns to Voyager with a guest, Arturis (Ray Wise), who helped him obtain supplies. Arturis learns of the encoded message and offers to help decrypt it. He is successful, and finds that the message is from Starfleet Command, with a nearby set of coordinates where their means of getting back home can be found. Though {{the rest of the}} crew is elated at this news, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) remains cautious, given that <b>the</b> <b>Borg</b> have never been able to assimilate Arturis' species. Voyager arrives at the provided coordinates to find an unmanned Starfleet vessel, the Dauntless, of unknown design. Aboard, they find the ship uses quantum slipstream technology, which will allow them to arrive back in the Alpha Quadrant within a few months.|$|E

5|$|The game {{opens with}} the Hazard Team {{conducting}} a holodeck training exercise {{set on a}} Borg ship; however, the team fails the exercise as most get captured by <b>the</b> <b>Borg,</b> and Munro accidentally destroys the ship while trying to rescue them. Following the termination of the exercise, Voyager is attacked by an unidentified ship. Voyager manages to destroy the ship, but takes heavy damage in the battle. The hostile ship explodes, emitting a shockwave that teleports the now–crippled Voyager to an unknown location, surrounded by derelict ships. As the Voyager crew attempts repairs, the ship is boarded by scavengers, who steal some of Voyagers cargo supplies before being driven off. In an effort to establish where Voyager is, the Hazard Team is sent to a derelict ship where power is still functioning to download the derelict's database. The mission goes awry when aliens begin transporting in and attacking the team; however, the aliens, identifying themselves as Etherians, eventually manage {{to communicate with the}} team, and the ordeal is waved off as a misunderstanding, allowing the Hazard Team to access the Etherian database.|$|E
