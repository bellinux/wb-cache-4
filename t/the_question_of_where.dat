5|$|Nevertheless, {{this left}} open <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>where</b> {{to locate the}} capital. Initially the Bombala {{district}} in the far south of NSW was proposed, to which southern Monaro, (which incorporated Bombala), Orange and Yass were soon added. The NSW Premier, John See, offered to provide {{any of the three}} recommended sites as a future capital territory. Edmund Barton, the first Prime Minister of the new Federal Government, added another four sites to this list: Albury, Tamworth, Armidale and Tumut, and members of the new government toured the various sites in 1902. The tour proved inconclusive, and upon their return the members decided to refer the problem to a Royal Commission, with the Minister for Home Affairs, William Lyne, pushing for Tumut or Albury as he preferred a site in his electorate. Subsequently, the Commission presented its report to Parliament in 1903, recommending the sites of Albury, Tumut and Orange, in that order. However, there continued to be problems, as the House of Representatives backed the Tumut option, while the Senate preferred the town of Bombala. As a result of this disagreement the bill lapsed, and it was left to the second Parliament to choose a location for the capital.|$|E

25|$|Since Le Sage's {{particles}} must lose speed when {{colliding with}} ordinary matter (in {{order to produce}} a net gravitational force), {{a huge amount of}} energy must be converted to internal energy modes. If those particles have no internal energy modes, the excess energy can only be absorbed by ordinary matter. Addressing this problem, Armand Jean Leray proposed a particle model (perfectly similar to Le Sage's) in which he asserted that the absorbed energy is used by the bodies to produce magnetism and heat.

Some believe this would {{solve the problem of}} how a designer or design team capable of fine-tuning the Universe could come to exist. Cosmologist Alan Guth believes humans will in time be able to generate new universes. By implication previous intelligent entities may have generated our Universe. This idea leads to the possibility that the extraterrestrial designer/designers are themselves the product of an evolutionary process in their own universe, which must therefore itself be able to sustain life. However it also raises <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>where</b> that universe came from, leading to an infinite regress.|$|E
25|$|The foreign {{invasion}} theory {{does not}} answer <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>where</b> the inhabitants went. David Webster believed that the population should have increased {{because of the lack}} of elite power. Further, it is not understood why the governmental institutions were not remade following the revolts, which happened under similar circumstances in places like China. A study by anthropologist Elliot M. Abrams came to the conclusion that buildings, specifically in Copan, did not require an extensive amount of time and workers to construct. However, this theory was developed during a period when the archaeological evidence showed that there were fewer Maya people than there are now known to have been. Revolutions, peasant revolts, and social turmoil change circumstances, and are often followed by foreign wars, but they run their course. There are no documented revolutions that caused wholesale abandonment of entire regions.|$|E

40|$|Calcium K-line {{photometry}} {{is reported}} for 27 A-type {{stars in the}} Praesepe cluster, and the data obtained are compared with previous K-line observations of Hyades stars.

Comparison with the Hyades results indicates that the Praesepe stars are as metal-enriched as the Hyades stars. These results are taken as evidence favoring Eggen's (1960) proposal that the Hyades and Praesepe clusters should be regarded as a single group having, on the average, about a factor-of-two higher metal abundance than solar-neighborhood field stars as well as a high internal dispersion in metal-line strengths. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>where</b> and how <b>the</b> Praesepe-Hyades stars acquired their high average metal abundances, K-line strengths, and associated dispersions are briefly considered...|$|R
