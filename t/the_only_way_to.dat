5|$|Another sort of {{risk that}} can affect dry cargoes, is {{absorption}} of ambient moisture. When very fine concretes and aggregates mix with water, the mud created {{at the bottom of}} the hold shifts easily and can produce a free surface effect. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> control these risks is by good ventilation practices and careful monitoring for the presence of water.|$|E

5|$|Guiteau came {{to believe}} he had lost the {{position}} {{because he was a}} Stalwart. The office-seeker decided that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> end the internecine warfare in the Republican Party was for Garfield to die—though he had nothing personal against the president. Arthur's succession would restore peace, he felt, and lead to rewards for fellow Stalwarts, including Guiteau.|$|E

5|$|Iran was {{the largest}} {{provider}} of fuel subsidies {{in the world by}} 2009.

5|$|Some exact {{solutions}} describe {{gravitational waves}} without any approximation, e.g., a wave train traveling through empty space or Gowdy universes, varieties of an expanding cosmos filled with gravitational waves. But for gravitational waves produced in astrophysically relevant situations, {{such as the}} merger of two black holes, numerical methods are presently <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> construct appropriate models.|$|E
5|$|The family {{continues}} {{to sing and}} more videos are shown. Snake again breaks {{into the house and}} claims that he got a song stuck in his head and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get rid of it is to kill the Simpsons. He tries to shoot them, but discovers that his gun is out of ammunition and leaves again.|$|E
50|$|As {{concern about}} {{landfill}} space increases, worldwide interest in recycling {{by means of}} composting is growing, since composting is a process for converting decomposable organic materials into useful stable products.

50|$|It {{should also}} be noted that § 1001,“determination of amount of and {{recognition}} of gain or loss,” provides a definition for “sale or disposition of property,” which is broader than § 1222’s “sale or exchange” definition, as “sale or exchange” are not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> dispose of property.|$|R

5|$|A Six Person Intergender Tag Team Bimbo Brawl {{match with}} Traci Brooks as the Special Guest Referee was next, pitting {{the team of}} ODB, Rhaka Khan, and Rhino against The Beautiful People (Angelina Love, Cute Kip, and Velvet Sky).

5|$|After {{the death}} of Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev became the Soviet leader {{following}} the deposition and execution of Lavrentiy Beria and the pushing aside of rivals Georgy Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov. On 25 February 1956, Khrushchev shocked delegates to the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party by cataloguing and denouncing Stalin's crimes.

5|$|At present, {{there are}} two ways to get to Arad: by air or road. The only highway {{connecting}} Arad with the rest of the country is Highway 31, which connects it with Beersheba to the west, and the Dead Sea to the east. It has two junctions within Arad's municipal area—the Arad Junction (within the city itself, with Road 3199), and the Tel Arad Junction (with Highway 80). The local Road 3199 connects Arad with Masada, but does not connect to the road next to the dead sea (Highway 90). It is therefore <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get to Masada's western side.|$|E

50|$|In November 1939, the Japanese {{landed on}} the coast of Guangxi and {{captured}} Nanning.

5|$|Booth {{worked his}} way into the company with a string of false claims about his influence, and finally became {{chairman}} of the Board of Directors by claiming that it was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> avoid Gruban being interned due to his German origin. As soon as this happened, he cut Gruban out of the company, leaving him destitute, and eventually arranged for him to be interned. Gruban successfully appealed against the internment, and brought Booth to court.|$|E
5|$|Bret Hart was {{scheduled}} to defend his title against Bob Backlund at Survivor Series 1994. The stipulations stated that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> win was to force the person in your opponent's corner to throw a towel into the ring. Davey Boy Smith was in Bret's corner, while Owen Hart was in Backlund's corner. Smith chased Owen around the ring until Smith suffered a kayfabe injury, leaving nobody to throw in Bret's towel. As Backlund performed the crossface chickenwing on Bret, Owen pretended to show remorse. He convinced his mother, Helen, to throw in Bret's towel. After Backlund was awarded the belt, Owen celebrated his success in costing Bret the title.|$|E

50|$|Yaxchilan {{has long}} been {{difficult}} to reach other than by river. Until recently, no roads existed within 100 miles. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> site were hundreds of miles by boat, or else by small plane. Since {{the construction of the}} Border Highway by the Mexican Government in the early 1980s, it is possible for tourists to visit. To reach the site, it is necessary now only to take an hour-long boat ride down the Usumacinta River from Frontera Corozal.|$|R
