25|$|I have an {{obsession}} with death and sex. <b>Those</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> are also the nexus of horror films, which I've been obsessing over lately. I’ve been watching horror movies and 1950s science fiction movies. My re-release is called The Fame Monster so I've just been sort of bulimically eating and regurgitating monster movies and all things scary. I've just been noticing a resurgence of this idea of monster, of fantasy, but {{in a very real}} way. If you notice in those films, there’s always a juxtaposition of sex with death. That's what makes it so scary. Body and mind are primed for orgasm and instead somebody gets killed. That's the sort of sick, twisted psychological circumstance.|$|E
500|$|Box-office {{analysts and}} critics debated the film's underperformance. Analyst Jeff Bock, of Exhibitor Relations, {{reasoned}} the film underperformed {{at the box}} office due to two reasons; the first, he said, is the genre. Bock stated that Americans get horror and comedy, but with the idea [...] "of <b>those</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> together in one place, people suddenly get very dumb". [...] "The horror-comedy genre is the toughest sell in Hollywood", he said. He noted films Tremors, Slither, Shaun of the Dead, Eight Legged Freaks and The Evil Dead series, and said that while many of those are considered critical and business successes, [...] "none of them have brought in the megabucks that a simple horror or comedy can." [...] In addition, he labeled the Scream franchise as more [...] "straight-up horror" [...] than comedy and stated Zombielands box office performance would determine the horror-comedy genre's current viability.|$|E
500|$|Grande came up {{with the}} idea of the music video and {{contacted}} Max Landis, known for his 2012 film Chronicle. In an interview, Grande explained: [...] "It's very unique, it's very different, I called Max [...] up and I said 'hey I want to do something that ends exactly like this' and I described the ending shot to him and then I said I also want it to be (a) one take … and I want the ending shot to look like this, And I described <b>those</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> to him and he’s like, 'wow, that's ambitious and it’s brave and it’s different, but let's try it". A day later, Grande discussed the video's concept and said that it was [...] "the coolest concept ever and he killed it and it's very different. I'm very nervous about it because it's so unique and weird and I feel like brave and different, but it’s exciting".|$|E

500|$|Mellor's earlier works {{examined}} {{the relationships between}} cultures, including in his mezzotint prints in which he juxtaposed [...] "images of native and introduced flora and fauna—for example, a kangaroo with a bull—to symbolise two different peoples and cultures". These issues were also addressed in his painting for the exhibition Native Titled Now, shown in South Australia in 1996. Mellor's interest in cultural interactions extends beyond the making of his art. In a panel discussion on Indigenous art education, Mellor emphasised that, in teaching Indigenous art within visual arts, {{it was important to}} be aware of both Aboriginal and settler history, [...] "so you can talk about their interaction and the whole set of issues that arise from <b>those</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> being parallel". Mellor's emphasis on past interactions between cultures led gallerist and critic Michael Reid to consider that Mellor's works had earned him [...] "an important place in the visual narrative of Australian history".|$|E
500|$|Julian Jarrold became {{attached}} {{to direct the}} film in early 2005. It was his second feature film, after Kinky Boots, which was released later that year. According to Bernstein, he [...] "liked [...] style as it was modern and visceral, and I just {{had a feeling that}} he was the right choice. This piece needed to be handed with delicacy but also {{with a certain amount of}} brio and Julian was able to bring <b>those</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> to the production." [...] The director began work on the project in early 2006, rereading the novels Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Persuasion and also reviewing Austen biographies such as Spence's book. Jarrold depended most heavily on the script, calling it [...] "a rich, witty and clever screenplay from someone who obviously knew his subject very well. It is a love story but much more besides. Kevin's screenplay has so many layers and interesting ideas. Apart from the love story I was very attracted by the themes of imagination and experience." [...] The director intended to [...] "bring Austen up to date by roughening her up a bit" [...] and adding [...] "more life and energy and fun," [...] opining that past Austen adaptations had been [...] "a little bit picture-postcard and safe and sweet and nice." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 23, 2016, it was {{reported}} that Miramax and Blumhouse Productions were developing a new Halloween film, which they would co-finance. John Carpenter is set to executive produce the project and act as creative consultant. Carpenter said, [...] "Thirty-eight years after the original Halloween, I'm going to help {{to try to make the}} 10th sequel the scariest of them all." [...] On February 9, 2017, Carpenter announced that the new Halloween film would be released on October 19, 2018 and was going to be written by David Gordon Green and Danny McBride, and directed by Green. It will be a direct sequel to the original film and will ignore all the sequels. In September 2017, Jamie Lee Curtis confirmed that she would reprise her role as Laurie Strode. In October, Judy Greer entered negotiations to play Laurie's daughter Karen Strode. The film will be distributed by Universal Pictures, their first involvement in the franchise since distributing 1982's Halloween III: Season of the Witch. On October 17, 2017, Carpenter announced that he would be returning to score the upcoming film, saying [...] "I’ll be consulting with the director to see what he feels. I could create a new score, we could update the old score and amplify it, or we could combine <b>those</b> <b>two</b> <b>things.</b> I’ll have to see the movie to see what it requires." ...|$|E

500|$|Sheen {{was raised}} in a {{theatrical}} family—his parents were both involved in local amateur operatics and musicals and, later in life, his father worked as a part-time professional Jack Nicholson look-alike. In his teenage years, Sheen was involved with the West Glamorgan Youth Theatre and, later, the National Youth Theatre of Wales. [...] "It was a brilliant youth theatre", Sheen has said, [...] "and it taught me not only a lot about acting, but also about work ethic; it was very disciplined." [...] He was influenced by the performances of Laurence Olivier and the writings of theatre critic Kenneth Tynan—"the combination of <b>those</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> kind of blew my head off." [...] Sheen was educated at Blaenbaglan Primary School, Glan Afan Comprehensive School and, finally, Neath Port Talbot College where he sat A-levels in English, Drama and Sociology. He considered studying English at university but instead decided to attend drama school. He moved to London in 1988 to train as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), having spent the previous year working in a Welsh fast food restaurant called Burger Master to earn money. Sheen was granted the Laurence Olivier Bursary by The Society of London Theatre in his second year at RADA. He graduated in 1991 with a BA in Acting.|$|E
500|$|Early in the series, Clark {{was still}} {{learning}} how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of <b>those</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{his first}} press conference as President-elect, Obama was {{questioned}} by reporters {{as to which}} breed the family was looking to acquire; he replied, [...] "We have two criteria {{that have to be}} reconciled. One is that Malia is allergic, so it has to be hypoallergenic. There are a number of breeds that are hypoallergenic. On the other hand, our preference would be to get a shelter dog, but, obviously, a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me. So – so whether we're {{going to be able to}} balance <b>those</b> <b>two</b> <b>things,</b> I think, is a pressing issue on the Obama household." ...|$|E

The ranch of Cousin Alick Morton (son of that brother of Frances Freeland, who, absorbed in horses, had wandered to Australia and died in falling from them) had extended a welcome to Derek. <b>Those</b> <b>two</b> would have a voyage of happiness--see together the red sunsets in the Mediterranean, Pompeii, and the dark ants of men swarming in endless band {{up and down with}} their coal-sacks at Port Said; smell the cinnamon gardens of Colombo; sit up on deck at night and watch the stars....

While Alastray organizes the men of the village to build a dam, the Yaqui attack and massacre many of the inhabitants of the village. The angry villagers order the priest out. Alastray leaves, with Kinita following. He tells her all his life he has fallen just short of achieving something meaningful, and sends her back to the village. A storm of approaching riders are heard, and the two take cover. They see Teclo and the Yaqui leader, Golden Lance (Jaime Fernández) together, and realize the alliance of <b>those</b> <b>two</b> means terrible <b>things</b> for the village.|$|R
2500|$|Duncan Smith's defence of his {{department}} was that [...] "You cannot absolutely prove <b>those</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> are connected – you cannot disprove what I said.

2500|$|While {{the central}} concept behind Buffy was [...] "high {{school as a}} horror movie" [...] in small-town America, co-creators David Greenwalt and Whedon were looking to make Angel into a {{different}} [...] "gritty, urban show." [...] Whedon explained, [...] "We wanted a much darker show, darker in tone. It's set in Los Angeles {{because there are a}} lot of demons in L.A. and a wealth of stories to be told. We also wanted to take the show a little older and have the characters deal with demons in a much different way. Buffy is always the underdog trying to save the world, but Angel is looking for redemption. It's <b>those</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> that creatively make the shows different." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, in March 2005, Tobias told PBS' Frontline:"Well, {{the heart}} of our {{prevention}} programs is what's known as ABC: Abstinence, Be faithful, and the correct and consistent use of Condoms, when appropriate. And it's not [...] "ABC: Take your pick." [...] It's abstinence really focused heavily on young people and getting them to understand {{that the best way to}} keep from getting infected is to be abstinent and not engage in sexual activity until they are old enough and mature enough and get into a committed relationship, such as a marriage. B is being faithful within that committed relationship. And A and B, <b>those</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> together clearly had a huge impact in bringing the infection rates down in Uganda.|$|E
60|$|But Neilson {{could not}} get the story out of his head. Perhaps because he was sick and weakly, the radiant health of Red appealed to his imagination. Himself an ugly man, {{insignificant}} of appearance, he prized very highly comeliness in others. He had never been passionately in love, and certainly {{he had never been}} passionately loved. The mutual attraction of <b>those</b> <b>two</b> young <b>things</b> gave him a singular delight. It had the ineffable beauty of the Absolute. He went again to the little hut by the creek. He had a gift for languages and an energetic mind, accustomed to work, and he had already given much time {{to the study of the}} local tongue. Old habit was strong in him and he was gathering together material for a paper on the Samoan speech. The old crone who shared the hut with Sally invited him to come in and sit down. She gave him kava to drink and cigarettes to smoke. She was glad to have someone to chat with and while she talked he looked at Sally. She reminded him of the Psyche in the museum at Naples. Her features had the same dear purity of line, and though she had borne a child she had still a virginal aspect.|$|R

2500|$|Osterberg {{was first}} {{inspired}} {{to form the}} Stooges after meeting blues drummer Sam Lay {{during a visit to}} Chicago. Upon returning to Detroit, Osterberg sought to create a new form of blues music that was not derivative of historical precedents. [...] Ron Asheton (guitar) and Scott Asheton (drums) and Dave Alexander (bass guitar) composed the rest of the band, with Osterberg as main singer. Osterberg became interested in Ron Asheton after seeing him perform in the Chosen Few (a covers band), believing [...] "I’ve never met a convincing musician that didn’t look kind of ill and kind of dirty, and Ron had <b>those</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> covered!" [...] The three nicknamed Osterberg [...] "Pop" [...] after a local character whom Osterberg resembled. Shortly after witnessing an MC5 concert in Ann Arbor, Osterberg began using the stage name Iggy Pop, a name that he has used ever since.|$|E
2500|$|Powell {{described}} {{joining the}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) during college {{as one of}} the happiest experiences of his life; discovering something he loved and could do well, he felt he had [...] "found himself." [...] According to Powell: It was only once I was in college, about six months into college when I found something that I liked, and that was ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps in the military. And I not only liked it, but I was pretty good at it. That's what you really have to look for in life, something that you like, and something that you think you're pretty good at. And if you can put <b>those</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> together, then you're on the right track, and just drive on. Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, the ROTC fraternal organization and drill team begun by General John Pershing. Even after he had become a general, Powell kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition.|$|E
2500|$|Modeliste {{grew up in}} the 13th Ward of New Orleans. The {{eldest of}} six siblings, he was raised in part by his grandmother, Lula Blouin. His first drum set was a three-piece paid for by Blouin. He was nicknamed Zigaboo at age ten by a {{neighborhood}} kid, and by junior high school the name had stuck. His drumming style was influenced by Smokey Johnson, Bob French and other New Orleans drum greats as he learned by watching them perform at gigs. He said listening to other musicians was {{the most important part of}} his learning process. He particularly tried to emulate Smokey Johnson's style. He started playing gigs at an early age including a stint with The Hawketts, a band led by Art Neville at the time. Over time the band evolved into The Neville Sounds and by late 1960s into The Meters. In a 2013 interview with Modern Drummer, Modeliste said: [...] "Your biggest teachers were <b>those</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> you got on the side of your head. (...) It's got nothing to do with rudiments, nothing to do with time signatures, but it's got a lot to do with what you hear." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{instinct}} to couple, starved within herself, was always {{at work in}} June. She stood watching Fleur row back; the girl took her hand off a scull to wave farewell, and June walked languidly on between the meadows and the river, with an ache in her heart. Youth to youth, like the dragon-flies chasing each other, and love like the sun warming them through and through. Her youth! So long ago--when Phil and she--And since? Nothing--no one had been quite what she had wanted. And so she had missed it all. But what a coil was round <b>those</b> <b>two</b> young <b>things,</b> if they really were in love, as Holly would have it--as her father, and Irene, and Soames himself seemed to dread. What a coil, and what a barrier! And the itch for the future, the contempt, as it were, for what was overpast, which forms the active principle, moved {{in the heart of}} one who ever believed that what one wanted was more important than what other people did not want. From the bank, awhile, in the warm summer stillness, she watched the water-lily plants and willow leaves, the fishes rising; sniffed the scent of grass and meadow-sweet, wondering how she could force everybody to be happy. Jon and Fleur! Two little lame ducks--charming callow yellow little ducks! A great pity! Surely something could be done! One must not take such situations lying down. She walked on, and reached a station, hot and cross.|$|R
60|$|Well, during <b>those</b> <b>two</b> years many <b>things</b> befell me. First of all, {{in company}} with {{my old friend}} Sir Stephen Somers, I made the {{expedition}} to Pongoland {{in search of the}} wonderful orchid which he desired to add to his collection. I have already written of that journey and our extraordinary adventures, and need therefore allude to it no more here, except to say that during the course of it I was sorely tempted to travel to the territory north of the lake in which the Pongos dwelt. Much did I desire to see whether Messrs. Harût and Marût would in truth appear to conduct me to the land where the wonderful elephant which was supposed to be animated by an evil spirit was waiting to be killed by my rifle. However, I resisted the impulse, as indeed our circumstances obliged me to do. In the end we returned safely to Durban, and here I {{came to the conclusion that}} never again would I risk my life on such mad expeditions.|$|R

5000|$|Haggis made {{a number}} of key changes from the French film:They made it quite clear from the {{beginning}} of the film, she was innocent, and that he was loving, and he'd do anything to get her out, and, in the end, they lived happily ever after. The bumps along the way were good but I thought I could make him pay a larger price. So, the first thing I did was ask myself what the question was. I need to have a question if I'm starting a movie. The question I came up with, and I'm not sure if it's reflected in the film or not, but it's what I was writing toward, was: Would you save the woman you loved if you knew that by doing so you'd become someone she'd no longer love? That interested me. And that wasn't in the French film at all. The whole issue of innocence was fascinating to me because I didn’t necessarily want to say whether she was guilty or innocent. I just wanted John to be the only one who believes she’s innocent. The evidence is overwhelming. Even his parents think she’s probably guilty. Even their own lawyer. Yet he still believed… and what that level of belief does for someone, how infectious it is. So, <b>those</b> are <b>two</b> <b>things</b> I was playing with.Cavayé told The Age regarding the remake of the film by Haggis, he is eager [...] "to be a spectator of my own film".
