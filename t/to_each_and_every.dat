The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 8.2/10 based on 5 reviews. Jim Kaz of IGN gave the season a similar score at 8/10. While at first hesitant of the series, believing it to be [...] "another horror/sci-fi/occult hybrid currently igniting ratings", he found the [...] "eerie and intricate storylines" [...] to overcome the [...] "initial impressions of Clearasil ads and Paris Hilton in House of Wax". Praising the cliffhangers and the brotherly chemistry between the lead actors, Kaz deemed Supernatural [...] "one-helluva edge-of-your-seat, ball-burner of a series with a forceful script, excellent acting (said pretty boys included) and some fine special effects". Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune thoroughly enjoyed the season, and [...] "really, really liked" [...] the Roadhouse. Not understanding why the Roadhouse was not used more throughout the season, she was [...] "pretty annoyed" [...] when it was destroyed. Ryan also favored the new hunter characters, especially Ash, and was [...] "not thrilled" [...] when Ash was killed. Regarding Sam and Dean, she noted the series' [...] "ability [...] the brotherly conflicts and emotions threaded through a well-plotted monster-of-the-week story". While she enjoyed Tricia Helfer's guest appearance, she did not enjoy the stunt casting of Linda Blair and would have preferred a [...] "more skilled actress". The season received a grade of a B- from Brian Tallerico of UGO, who found it [...] "frustrating" [...] due {{to the use of}} the [...] "same predictable formula" [...] that did not meet the standards of the first season. Other problems he found included [...] "the brothers [...] whiny and mopey and [...] everything too seriously". However, he believed that the season ended [...] "strong"—he liked how the main storyline was wrapped up, opening new storylines—and noted that there were some [...] "excellent" [...] episodes. Tallerico praised the [...] "tongue-in-cheek Winchester adventure" [...] "The Usual Suspects", feeling that it had [...] "enough pop culture references to make Tarantino jealous" [...] and the [...] "pitch-perfect mix of tones that make the show so great". He also found [...] "Nightshifter" [...] to be the [...] "best action hour of Supernaturals second year", deeming it [...] "riveting from beginning to end". Also applauding the season's cliffhanger was Peter Brown of iFMagazine, who gave the season a B+. He enjoyed the expansion of the series' mythology, as well as the new characters introduced. He also praised the [...] "haunting music and sounds that really give a chilling feel <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>and</b> <b>every</b> episode", feeling them to be Emmy-worthy.|$|E
