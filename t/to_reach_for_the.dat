25|$|Chalicotherium, {{like many}} members of Perissodactyla, was adapted to browsing, though uniquely adapted to do so among its {{ungulate}} relatives. Its arms were long and heavily clawed, allowing them to walk on their knuckles only. The arms were used <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> branches of large trees and bring them close to its long head to strip them clean of leaves. The horse-like head itself shows adaptation to a diet of soft vegetation, since, as the animal reached sexual maturity, the incisors and upper canines were shed, suggesting that its muscular lips and the resulting gum pads were enough to crop fodder which was then processed by squarish, low-crowned molars.|$|E

Pakistan won the first match against Bangladesh by 21 runs. Salman Butt became {{the hero of the}} match with his 73 runs from just 46 balls. The second match for Pakistan was with Australia, where Australia won the toss and elected to bat. They scored 191/10 with 49 ball 81 runs by Shane Watson. In this match, final over of Australian innings was bowled by Mohammad Amir. He took a triple-wicket maiden and there were two run-outs, and {{eventually}} five wickets fell in the final over of Australia's innings.|$|E

500|$|With {{the success}} of his lessons, Chalmers plans to take them all on a field trip to Springfield Forest, in which Roosevelt left one of his spectacles. The field trip does not go well, however, as Nelson breaks his arm when he tries <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> spectacles. Since it was an {{unauthorized}} field trip, Nelson's mother threatens to sue the school for medical expenses, which leads to Chalmers getting fired. In order to save Chalmers' job, Bart and his friends, who now go by the name [...] "The Brotherhood of the Spectacles", take over the school in a hostage situation and stand up for the teacher who made a meaningful impact to them. They lock all of the teachers out of the school and demand that Chalmers get reinstated. A SWAT team prepares to storm the school, before Chalmers walks up to convince Bart to stop. Luckily, Chief Wiggum accidentally drops his gun, knee-capping the school representative State Comptroller Atkins, who thereafter agrees to reinstate Chalmers because they can recover the money lost in the previous lawsuit with a new lawsuit against the police department.|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to rebel from his father, Peter decides <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> freezer to take out some ice cream during dinner, much {{to the chagrin of}} Tom Tucker, who {{attempts}} to stop him. As Peter lifts a spoon of ice cream to his mouth, he is warned by Tucker several times not to eat it. When he does, however, Tucker repeatedly spanks him, in reference to the 1979 drama feature Kramer vs. Kramer (even though the spanking does not occur in the movie). After author Gore Vidal appears at the radio station Brian had invited him to speak at, Vidal quickly leaves after he finds the show to be low-brow. This causes Brian to quit the show, noting that he has become [...] "worse of a sell-out" [...] than when Stewie appeared in a Butterfinger commercial. Stewie is then shown eating a Butterfinger, and says [...] "Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger", which is a parody of the many Butterfinger commercials featuring Bart Simpson, and utters the annoyed grunt, D'oh!, a phrase used regularly by The Simpsons character Homer Simpson. The bit is also a reference to the negative criticism and similarities between Family Guy and The Simpsons.|$|E

ExtremeTech felt that Windows10 restricted the choices of users, citing its more opaque setting menus, forcing users to give up bandwidth for the peer-to-peer distribution of updates, and for taking away user control of specific functions, such as updates, explaining that [...] "it feels, once again, as if Microsoft has taken the seed of a good idea, like providing users with security updates automatically, and shoved the throttle to maximum." ...|$|E

Some consider this [...] "Nabokovian vocabulary" [...] a failing, for it might require even educated speakers of English <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dictionary on occasion.

[...] Michael O'Sullivan at The Washington Post was mixed, deeming the film a [...] "broad, wildly hit-or-miss satire," [...] remarking that he found few of the jokes in the film funny. [...] "Spiritually, it's closer to a mid-range crowd-pleaser such as City Slickers than Blazing Saddles, too enamoured of genre convention <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> comic dynamite," [...] wrote Mike McCahill at The Guardian.|$|E

[...] Kelly Brook was in tears and called her performance, [...] "beautiful and lovely". Media reports at the time claimed that Steel had referred to Cowell as a bully for critical comments he made after her first appearance on the show; however, a blog at a Lancashire newspaper's web site that was attributed to Steel and her mother denied that she had ever made such a comment. Commentators and mainstream media outlets speculated that she might defeat Susan Boyle, who had made an impression worldwide in the first show of the series. [...] Over thirteen million viewers watched Steel's performance and, within one day of a video of her performance being posted on YouTube, over a million viewers had seen her worldwide. She was interviewed on US television via satellite link during NBC's Today show.|$|E

First, they decide to go drag racing. After the cars crash, they head for the diner. Lana and Luca pull down the shutter of the diner, to see the word [...] "MURDERER" [...] painted in bold, red letters – they hurriedly push the shutter up. The men begin the fighting competition. The fighting areas are marked out using tyres, and a blackboard inscribed [...] "Fight club – score" [...] is hung from a wall. Eight men take part in separate two-men fights, and the winners of each match fight each other successively. Luca is defeated {{by one of the}} mechanics. Lana goes upstairs to her apartment, and is also taken hostage by Angelo. In the midst of the fighting competition, a shot suddenly rings out. Angelo emerges from the apartment with his gun pointed at Lana and Rita. Angelo attacks Luca and they fight, at the pinnacle of the struggle Angelo kisses Luca violently, and then the gun is wrested from Angelo's grip and falls to the ground. Luca subdues Angelo and tries <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> gun. Before he can do so, he is shot dead by Lana, descending from the steps leading to the apartment with another gun.

[...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter states [...] "Brandishing an ambition it's likely no film, including this one, could entirely fulfill, The Tree of Life is nonetheless a singular work, an impressionistic metaphysical inquiry into mankind's place {{in the grand scheme}} of things that releases waves of insights amidst its narrative imprecisions." [...] Justin Chang of Variety states the film [...] "represents something extraordinary" [...] and [...] "is in many ways his simplest yet most challenging work, a transfixing odyssey through time and memory that melds a young boy's 1950s upbringing with a magisterial rumination on the Earth's origins." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone states [...] "Shot with a poet's eye, Malick's film is a groundbreaker, a personal vision that dares <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> stars." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film much praise and stated, [...] "The sheer beauty of this film is almost overwhelming, but as with other works of religiously minded art, its aesthetic glories are tethered to a humble and exalted purpose, which is to shine the light of the sacred on secular reality". Total Film gave the film a five-star review (denoting 'outstanding'): [...] "The Tree of Life is beautiful. Ridiculously, rapturously beautiful. You could press 'pause' at any second and hang the frame on your wall." [...] Richard Corliss of Time named it one of the Top 10 Best Movies of 2011.|$|E

2500|$|During a {{sequence}} involving the detonation {{of an enormous}} kaoba tree, Friedkin {{was faced with a}} problem of inadequate explosive power. Initially, Marcel Vercoutere, a special effects man who previously worked with the director on The Exorcist, was to be responsible for the explosion. However, it did not achieve the required effect and barely damaged the tree. This prompted Friedkin <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> services of an arsonist hailing from Queens, New York, going by the pseudonym [...] "Marvin the Torch", who arrived at the Dominican Republic three days after the call and utilizing flammable materials obliterated the tree in one take the following morning. A week into the shooting in the Dominican Republic, Friedkin and his crew went to Los Angeles to process the film and view dailies. The director described the prologues as [...] "beautifully shot", but he was dissatisfied with the jungle scenes which he deemed [...] "underexposed" [...] and [...] "dark". He told Dick Bush a reshoot would be necessary. Bush, on the other hand, argued that filming should have taken place on a stage where he could have adequately adjusted the lighting. The response reminded Friedkin of his previous problems on the set of The Boys in the Band and offended him, as from the very beginning he had wanted to shoot the entire film on location. Upon seeing the underexposed scenes, Bush reportedly [...] "lost confidence" [...] and was subsequently dismissed, which forced Friedkin to employ a new camera crew. He replaced Bush with John M. Stephens with whom he had worked under David L. Wolper. Stephens applied necessary changes, including the employment of reflectors balancing [...] "the deep shadows of the tall trees", as well as replacing lenses and film stock. This resulted in a leap of cinematographic quality which delighted the director, who has said [...] "the locations looked beautiful to the eye".|$|E
