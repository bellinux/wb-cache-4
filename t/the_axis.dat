5|$|At {{the end of}} September 1940, the Tripartite Pact united Japan, Italy and Germany to formalise <b>the</b> <b>Axis</b> Powers.

Romania would make a major contribution (as did Hungary) to <b>the</b> <b>Axis</b> war against the USSR, partially to recapture territory ceded to the USSR, partially to pursue its leader Ion Antonescu's desire to combat communism.|$|E

This involves tracking the sun in one dimension – in its daily journey across the sky – but not adjusting for the seasons. The angle of <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> is normally horizontal, though some, such as the solar park at Nellis Airforce Base, which have a 20° tilt, incline <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> towards the equator in a north-south orientation – effectively a hybrid between tracking and fixed tilt.|$|E

25|$|A {{waveplate}} {{works by}} shifting the phase between two perpendicular polarization {{components of the}} light wave. A typical waveplate is simply a birefringent crystal with a carefully chosen orientation and thickness. The crystal is cut into a plate, with {{the orientation of the}} cut chosen so that <b>the</b> optic <b>axis</b> of <b>the</b> crystal is parallel to the surfaces of the plate. This results in two axes in the plane of the cut: <b>the</b> ordinary <b>axis,</b> with index of refraction no, and <b>the</b> extraordinary <b>axis,</b> with index of refraction ne. <b>The</b> ordinary <b>axis</b> is perpendicular to <b>the</b> optic <b>axis.</b> <b>The</b> extraordinary <b>axis</b> is parallel to <b>the</b> optic <b>axis.</b> For a light wave normally incident upon the plate, polarization component along <b>the</b> ordinary <b>axis</b> travels through <b>the</b> crystal with a speed vo = c/no, while the polarization component along <b>the</b> extraordinary <b>axis</b> travels with a speed ve = c/ne. This leads to a phase difference between the two components as they exit the crystal. When ne< no, as in calcite, <b>the</b> extraordinary <b>axis</b> is called <b>the</b> fast <b>axis</b> and <b>the</b> ordinary <b>axis</b> is called <b>the</b> slow <b>axis.</b> For nenbsp&> no the situation is reversed.|$|R

On 3 July, Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum; the French rejected it, and so the British ships opened fire.|$|E

5|$|On {{the day of}} <b>the</b> <b>Axis</b> {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, the Executive Committee of the Communist Internationalheadquartered in Moscowtelegraphed the Central Committee of the KPJ to take all measures to support and alleviate the struggle of the Soviet people, and to organise partisan detachments to fight <b>the</b> <b>Axis</b> in Yugoslavia. The Executive Committee also stressed that the fight, at the current stage, should not be about socialist revolution, but about the liberation from <b>the</b> <b>Axis</b> occupiers. In response to this appeal, {{the leaders of the}} KPJ decided on 4July in Belgrade to launch a nationwide armed uprising, which began three days later in western Serbia. The members of the KPJ-led forces were called Partisans, and their supreme commander was Tito. On 13July, in Sarajevo, the KPJ Provincial Committee for Bosnia-Herzegovina, headed by Svetozar Vukmanović, organised the province into military regions: Bosanska Krajina, Herzegovina, Tuzla, and Sarajevo.|$|E
5|$|Operation Barbarossa (German: Unternehmen Barbarossa) was {{the code}} name for <b>the</b> <b>Axis</b> {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, starting Sunday, 22 June 1941, during World War II. The operation stemmed from Nazi Germany's ideological aims to conquer the western Soviet Union {{so that it could}} be repopulated by Germans, to use Slavs as a slave-labour force for <b>the</b> <b>Axis</b> war-effort, and to seize the oil reserves of the Caucasus and the agricultural resources of Soviet territories.|$|E

5|$|The German–Yugoslav Partisan {{negotiations}} were held between German {{commanders in the}} Independent State of Croatia and the Supreme Headquarters of the Yugoslav Partisans in March 1943 during World War II. The negotiations – focused on obtaining a ceasefire and establishing a prisoner exchange – were conducted during <b>the</b> <b>Axis</b> Case White offensive. They were used by the Partisans to delay <b>the</b> <b>Axis</b> forces while the Partisans crossed the Neretva river, and to allow the Partisans to focus on attacking their Chetnik rivals led by Draža Mihailović. The {{negotiations were}} accompanied by an informal ceasefire that lasted about six weeks before being called off on orders from Adolf Hitler. The short-term advantage gained by the Partisans through the negotiations was lost when <b>the</b> <b>Axis</b> Case Black offensive was launched in mid-May 1943.

5|$|The Royal Navy transported the {{division}} to Tobruk from 19September to 25October, in a politically controversial move {{to relieve the}} mainly Australian garrison which had been defending the port for almost seven months, {{since the beginning of}} the Siege of Tobruk. Under daily aerial and artillery attacks, {{the division}} defended the port and conducted nightly offensive patrols against German and Italian positions. On 18November, the British Eighth Army launched Operation Crusader. The division was tasked with breaking out of Tobruk, following the destruction of <b>the</b> <b>Axis</b> armoured forces. Following unexpected early success, the division began its attacks on 21November, before the armoured formations of Germans and Italians had been defeated. Heavy fighting soon followed as the division captured several well-defended and dug-in German and Italian strong points. The looming threat of <b>the</b> <b>Axis</b> tanks ended the break-out offensive the following day. Renewed fighting on 26November saw the division link up with the approaching New Zealand Division, cutting <b>the</b> <b>Axis</b> lines of communication. In response, the Germans launched several counter-attacks to throw back the 70th Division from the territory they had gained. The failure of these attacks had a lasting strategic impact on Operation Crusader; <b>the</b> <b>Axis</b> forces began their retreat and lifted the siege of Tobruk. Two men—from units attached to the division—were awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions during Operation Crusader.|$|E
