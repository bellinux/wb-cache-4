40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the first {{analysis of the}} <b>two-tier</b> <b>market</b> hypothesis, regarding realized operational efficiency in the VLCC spot freight rates. Investigating this hypothesis is an important objective, because {{the existence of an}} efficiency premium in the spot market will induce ship owners to invest in more environmentally friendly vessels. We utilize a panel data set of 1, 007 voyage rate fixtures between January 2013 and September 2016, on routes between the Persian Gulf and the Eastern part of Asia. We test for an energy efficiency premium by implementing two different multiple regression models, firstly by adopting the traditional approach using an “external” market index as the market proxy. Our results suggest that the market rate proxy for a standardised vessel is dominant in terms of explanatory power, and our findings show no evidence for an efficiency premium after controlling for macro-, contract- and ship-specific variables. Secondly, seeking to circumvent the problems, which the market rate proxy presents, we construct a new market indicator from microdata. We control for contract- and ship-specific variables, as well as time, charter and owner fixed effects, and we find weak evidence for a <b>two-tier</b> <b>market</b> where energy-efficient vessels attract a premium in the freight rates. In a separate analysis, we examine whether fuel-inefficient vessels, which in theory should have a competitive disadvantage against more efficient ships, compensate by slowing down their speed.

It sheds light on the groping adjustment process by which internal economic policies are hit by or adapt to the external constraints. In 1944, an ambitious monetary reform laid down the economic policy objectives that remained in force for two decades, namely price stability and strong currency. However, we point out different incompatibilities between these objectives and the economic context of the 1950 s and 1960 s that could have negative consequences on Belgian economic growth?. More precisely, the long lasting European currencies inconvertibility (1944 - 1958) contradicted the orthodox approach of the monetary policy favoured by the Central Bank. When total convertability was finally achieved, the huge increase of capital movements led to a progressive loss of the monetary policy autonomy, despite the setting up of a <b>two-tier</b> exchange <b>market,</b> which can be viewed as an institutional innovation responding to new constraints.

40|$|First made {{available}} online in May 2015. In Soviet-type economies inflationary pressures, often reduced but not eliminated by central planning, {{take the form}} not only of open officially recorded inflation but also of hidden inflation (i. e. a differential between official price indices and the actual cost of living to consumers) and of repressed inflation (i. e. rising excess demand {{for goods and services}} at the actual prices in the state and non-state sectors). This paper reviews inflationary trends, the persistence of inflationary pressure under central planning and definitional problems for alternative types of inflation. Estimates of hidden inflation in recent literature are reviewed and generally found to understate the price differential in the controlled and uncontrolled markets. The wide divergence between recent estimates of repressed inflation, ranging between near-equilibrium and catastrophic imbalance, is then discussed. By and large excess money holdings in {{the economy as a whole}} (i. e. with reference to the <b>two-tier</b> <b>market</b> for consumption goods) are found to be small, but this is seen as consistent with large-scale imbalance in the state sector. A model is presented illustrating the complexity and time profile of repressed inflation definitions and measurements, due to the difference between the price level which would preserve equilibrium if it had been prevailing for a sufficiently long period, and the price levels (depending on the speed of adjustment) and their time paths which can restore market clearing at single prices starting from a <b>two-tier</b> <b>market</b> in a state of imbalance. Alternative stabilisation paths and their combination are also investigated, using as policy instruments the price level, a liquid wealth tax (or currency conversion) and supply improvements. The costs of hidden and repressed inflation are discussed and found to be greater than the cost of open inflation. In sum, the task of stabilisation in Soviet-type economies is seen as large-scale, time-consuming and complex, and its implementation imperative...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} three {{current issues}} in maritime economics by {{the application of}} semi-parametric estimations within a generalized additive model framework. First, this thesis shows that there are vessel and contract specific differences in time charter rates for dry bulk vessels. The literature on microeconomic factors of time charter rates could show {{the emergence of a}} <b>two-tier</b> tanker <b>market</b> during the post-OPA 90 period. However, previous results do not allow for any safe conclusions about the existence of a <b>two-tier</b> dry bulk <b>market.</b> This thesis extends the results of previous research by showing that {{a good part of the}} variation in physical time charter rates is due to microeconomic factors. It empirically proves the existence of a <b>two-tier</b> dry-bulk <b>market.</b> Controlling for a variety of contract specific effects as well as vessel specific factors the presented model quantifies quality induced differences in physical dry bulk charter rates. Second, the literature on the formation of ship prices focuses exclusively on rather homogeneous shipping segments, such as tankers and dry bulk carriers. Due to the comparatively low number of sales and the complexity of the ships, vessel valuation in highly specialised and small sectors, such as chemical tankers, is a much more challenging task. The empirical results of this thesis confirm the findings in recent literature that ship valuation is a non-linear function of size, age and market conditions, whilst other parameters that are particular to the chemicals market also play a significant role. The third topic addresses the recent increase in operational expenses of merchant vessels (opex). The available literature cannot explain the development nor provides information on vessel individual level. This thesis considers a quantitative model of opex that is particularly successful in explaining the variation in opex across vessels of different type, size, age and specification. The results confirm that differences in opex are due to the behaviour of a vessel's operator and to regulatory requirements. Furthermore, it shows that there are significant differences in opex due to earnings and employment status of a vessel. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a multi-period rational expectations {{model in which}} speculators differ in their information on past transaction prices (the ticker). Insiders ob-serve the entire price history whereas outsiders observe past prices with a delay. As prices are informative about the asset payoff, insiders get a strictly larger expected utility than outsiders. However, the welfare of all speculators declines with the proportion of insiders. For these reasons, charging a fee for real time information on the ticker and redistributing the related proceeds among spec-ulators maximizes traders ’ surpluses. The fee is such that, in equilibrium, the market optimally features both insiders and outsiders. This <b>two-tier</b> <b>market</b> structure also maximizes the profit that an exchange can achieve by selling ticker information and trading rights.

40|$|Abstract—Market {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} exploited as important means for spectrum acquisition and access in cognitive radio networks. In this paper, we propose a <b>two-tier</b> <b>market</b> for decentralized dynamic spectrum access. In the proposed Tier- 1 market, spectrum is traded from a primary user (PU) to secondary users (SUs) {{in a relatively}} large time scale to reduce signaling overhead. Then driven by dynamic traffic demands, SUs set up the Tier- 2 market to redistribute channels among themselves in a small time scale. More specifically, we use a Nash bargain game to model the spectrum acquisition of SUs in the Tier- 1 market and derive the equilibrium prices. We then employ a strategic bargain game to study the spectrum redistribution in the Tier- 2 market, where SUs can exchange channels with low overhead through random matching, bilateral bargain, and the predetermined market equilibrium price. We investigate how various factors, such as the availability of channels and bargain partners, matching strategies, and traffic dynamics, affect the market relationships. This work provides new understanding on the spectrum market and valuable guidelines to primary and secondary network operators.

Unlike the previous works that address this issue, we suppose that the production of the real good is costly and depends mainly of the price of an intermediate good produced locally by a privately-owned firm. We show that the real output of the final good chosen by the insider as well as the price of the intermediate good set by the privately-owned firm are both greater than {{it would be in the}} absence of insider trading. Furthermore, the parameters of both real markets affect the stock price and the stock pricing rule. Besides, when compared to Jain and Mirman (2000) and (2002), this two-tier real market structure does not alter the amount of information disseminated in the stock price or the level of insider trading. Next, we add a second insider to the model. We show that competition in the financial sector decreases the level of output produced by firm 1 and the price of the intermediate good with respect to initial model. Moreover, it affects the insiders' trades and increases the amount of information revealed in the stock price.

Using a recent longitudinal survey from the Netherlands, we find that temporary workers indeed participate less frequently in firm-sponsored training. However, this effect is fully driven by mismatches: holding a temporary contract does not significantly decrease the probability to receive training for workers in good job matches.
