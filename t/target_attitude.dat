40|$|In {{the event}} of a control failure on an axis of a spacecraft, a <b>target</b> <b>attitude</b> can be {{achieved}} by several sequential rotations around the remaining control axes. For a spacecraft actuating with wheels, the form of each submaneuver should be a pure single axis rotation since the failed axis should not be perturbed. The rotation path length in sequential submaneuvers, however, increases extremely but is short under normal conditions. In this work, it is shown that the path length is reduced dramatically by finding a proper number of sequential submaneuvers, especially for the <b>target</b> <b>attitude</b> rotation around the failed axis. A numerical optimization is suggested to obtain the shortest path length and the relevant number of maneuvers.

Across the 2 experiments there was consistent support for the hypothesis that participants would behave more in accordance with their attitudes when they received normative support for, rather than opposition to, their original attitude from a relevant reference group (i. e., their ingroup, not an outgroup). There was slightly weaker support for the second hypothesis that this effect would be stronger under high-than low-salience conditions. The third hypothesis (see Fazio, 1986), that attitude certainty and repeated expression of the attitude would strengthen attitude-behavior consistency, was well supported, as was the expectation that accessibility effects would be independent of reference group norm effects on attitude-behavior consistency...|$|E

Four experiments demonstrate that when people perceive that they have done a poor job resisting persuasion (e. g., they believe they generated weak arguments against a persuasive message), they lose attitude certainty, show reduced attitude–behavioral intention correspondence, and become more vulnerable to subsequent persuasive attacks. These findings suggest that resisted persuasive attacks can sometimes have a hidden yet important success by reducing the strength of the <b>target</b> <b>attitude...</b>|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that the act of answering an intention question can lead to a greater likelihood of engaging in the target behavior.

Many actions taken by marketers, including persuasion attempts (e. g., advertising) may lead to automatic attitude activation, but may not result in such overt behavioral changes. Over the course of three experiments, we test the hypothesis that mere-measurement effects occur because asking an intention question slips under the radar of our persuasion knowledge. In Experiments 1 and 2, we show that when manipulative intent is attributed to an intention question, people can adjust their behavior in response to the question, {{as long as they have}} sufficient cognitive capacity to permit conscious correction.

40|$|This paper reexamines the {{psychological}} process underlying {{the relationship between}} customer satisfaction and customer retention in a relational service context.

Data were collected from a survey with a sample of 209 clients from a major credit counseling organization in the USA. Account data indicating those clients' actual retention behavior were matched with the survey data. A two-step structural equation modeling (SEM) procedure was employed to establish the construct validity and test the hypotheses. The results revealed that the effect of customer satisfaction on retention is mediated by the more proximal determinants of the actual retention behavior. Specifically, customer satisfaction has both direct and indirect effects on customers' attitudes toward remaining in the Debt Management Program (DMP), which is the proximal predictor of customer retention. In addition, satisfaction alone cannot guarantee customer retention. Customers' perceived behavioral control exerts direct effects on their intention to remain and retention.

40|$|Keywordsattitude control, robust control, {{fuzzy logic}} The {{performance}} and power characteristics of any satellite {{attitude control system}} are crucial {{to the success of}} the satellite mission. This is especially true for small satellites, which have some of the strictest constraints of all. Reaction wheel systems are an attractive means of control for many satellites, because they offer a high pointing accuracy and are not fuel dependent. These systems are typically more complex, however, and can be fairly demanding on the satellite power system. This paper focuses on two major difficulties associated with the implementation of reaction wheel systems. First, the problem of model uncertainty and system robustness is addressed. In this portion of the paper, the equations of attitude dynamics are linearized with respect to the <b>target</b> <b>attitude</b> and robust control theory is used to ensure robust stability against parametric uncertainty in the reaction wheel angular momentum and satellite inertia matrix. Second, the problem of momentum unloading via induced magnetism is addressed.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} extent to which target forcing {{functions}} consisting of multiple ramplike or steplike changes in <b>target</b> <b>attitude</b> can be used for identification of multimodal pilot models. The main question addressed is whether such signals provide enough excitation of the pilot–vehicle system to allow for reliable estimation of pilot model parameters from measured pilot control data. The compensatory control task from a previous human-in-theloop experiment performed in a moving base flight simulator is used to define a typical multimodal pilot model identification problem. Using simulations of this control task, where different multisine and ramp target forcing function signals are used to excite the pilot–vehicle system (in addition to a multisine disturbance signal), the accuracy and consistency of pilot model estimation results are evaluated. It is found that both the bias and variance of the pilot model parameter estimates decrease with increasing ramp signal steepness. If the steepnesses of the ramps in the target signals are higher than 3 deg =s, estimation results are found to be more accurate than those obtained using a quasi-random target forcing function. This indicates that reliable pilot model identification results can be obtained using such ramp target forcing function signals...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCooperative target {{identification}} is the prerequisite for the relative position and orientation measurement between the space robot {{arm and the}} to-be-arrested object. We propose an on-orbit real-time robust algorithm for cooperative target identification in complex background using the features of circle and lines. It first extracts only the interested edges in the target image using an adaptive threshold and refines them to about single-pixel-width with improved non-maximum suppression. Adapting a novel tracking approach, edge segments changing smoothly in tangential directions are obtained. With {{a small amount of}} calculation, large numbers of invalid edges are removed. From the few remained edges, valid circular arcs are extracted and reassembled to obtain circles according to a reliable criterion. Finally, the target is identified if there are certain numbers of straight lines whose relative positions with the circle match the known target pattern. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm accurately identifies the cooperative target within the range of 0. 3 – 1. 5 m under complex background at the speed of 8 frames per second, regardless of lighting condition and <b>target</b> <b>attitude.</b> The proposed algorithm is very suitable for real-time visual measurement of space robot arm because of its robustness and small memory requirement...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{modeling}} of humanmanual control behavior for pursuit tracking tasks in which target forcing functions consisting of multiple ramp-like changes in <b>target</b> <b>attitude</b> are used. Due {{to the use}} of a pursuit display and the predictability of such forcing function signals, it can be anticipated that a pursuit or precognitive control strategy, consisting of open-loop feedforward control inputs in response to the predictable reference signal, is applied by the human operator. If combined with an additional disturbance on the controlled element, a control task results that is similar to performing a commanded turn entry/exit or altitude capture in turbulence. It is as of yet uncertain if such pursuit or precognitive control is indeed used during such a control task, and to what extent a quasi-random disturbance would suppress pursuit/precognitive control strategies. A human-in-the-loop evaluation of the combined ramp-following and disturbance-rejection task was performed to gather data for the modeling of human manual control behavior. It is found that despite the anticipated pursuit and precognitive control inputs, classical compensatory models of human manual control dynamics are highly capable of describing human dynamics for these specific control tasks. Measured control inputs, however, are found to correspond well with proposed models for open-loop feedforward operations as well, suggesting future evaluation of a model of human behavior that combines, or switches between, error-reducing compensatory and open-loop feedforward operations.

Methods The DOiT-program was implemented in Dutch prevocational secondary schools and evaluated using a controlled, cluster-randomised trial (September 2003 to May 2004). We examined mediators of effects regarding (1) consumption of sugar containing beverages (SCB); (2) consumption of high caloric snacks; (3) screen-viewing behaviour; and (4) active commuting to school. To improve these behaviours the DOiT-program tried to influence the following potentially mediating variables: attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, and habit-strength. Results Both in boys (n = 418) and girls (n = 436) the DOiT-intervention reduced SCB consumption (between group difference in boys = - 303. 5 ml/day, 95 % CI: - 502. 4;- 104. 5, between group difference in girls = - 222. 3 ml/day, 95 % CI: - 371. 3;- 73. 2). The intervention {{did not affect the}} other examined behaviours. In girls, no intervention effect on hypothetical mediators was found nor evidence of any mediating mechanisms. Boys in intervention schools improved their attitude towards decreasing SCB consumption, while this behaviour became less of a habit. Indeed, attitude and habit strength were significant mediators of the DOiT-intervention's effect (4. 5 and 3. 8 %, respectively) on SCB consumption among boys. Conclusion Our findings imply that interventions aimed at EBRB-change should be gender-specific. Future studies aimed at reducing SCB consumption among boys should <b>target</b> <b>attitude</b> and habit strength as mediating mechanisms.

40|$|Background: To date, {{skin cancer}} {{prevention}} initiatives {{have focused on}} attitudes and cognitions surrounding deliberate sun exposure such as tanning. In North Queensland (NQ) however, comparatively few people deliberately tan.

Findings: While participants reported negative perceptions of deliberate tanners, those who acquire a tan incidentally are perceived in a positive light.
