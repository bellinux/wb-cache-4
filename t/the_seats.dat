5|$|A {{systemic}} transformation happening {{sooner rather}} than later was made possible by the Polish legislative elections of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protesters in China. When the results of the voting were released, a political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> they were allowed to compete for in the Sejm, while in the newly established Senate they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (the other seat went to an independent, who later switched to Solidarity). At the same time, many prominent PZPR candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> that were reserved for them. The communists suffered a catastrophic blow to their legitimacy.|$|E

40|$|A {{new type}} of car seat has been {{designed}} in which the back-rest is able to move freely in the vertical direction. The design allows the back-rest to follow the vertical vibration {{of the back of}} an occupant of <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> This is intended to decrease any strain on the lumbar part of the spinal column caused by a different vertical motion at <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> squab and <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> back. <b>The</b> transmission of vertical (z axis) vibration from the base of this <b>seat</b> to <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> surface, to <b>the</b> back-rest and to the backs and heads of seat occupants has been measured. Measurements were made with <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> back fixed, to prevent vertical motion relative to <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> frame, and with <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> back free to move. Vibration transmissibilities from <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> base to <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> surface were characterized by a resonance at frequencies in the region of 4 Hz. The resonance frequencies were slightly higher with the fixed back-rest than with the moving back-rest. The transmissibilities at frequencies above 4 Hz -were generally higher with the fixed back-rest. Measurements with no contact between <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> occupants and <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> back indicated that the dynamic properties of the human body and <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> cushion were less influenced by <b>the</b> moving <b>seat</b> back than by <b>the</b> fixed <b>seat</b> back. Differential motion between <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> surface and seat back was smaller with <b>the</b> moving <b>seat</b> back than with the fixed back. © IMechE 1996. </p...|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} serious {{injuries}} were multiple lower leg fractures and dislocations, spinal fractures, hip fractures, head injuries, and multiple lacerations and contusions. The NTSB investigators found severe {{damage on the}} floor of the cabin, leading many of the passengers' seats to fracture where the legs met the floor track. This fracturing permitted many of <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> to come loose during the impact and aggravated the passengers' injuries. The report posits that the passengers' legs hit the lower seat frames in front of them. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> collapsed and twisted downward and to the left, likely causing hip and spinal fractures. As the impact progressed, <b>the</b> <b>seats,</b> now separated, flung passengers forward into each other as well as into other wreckage, causing head injuries and lacerations. Passengers holding onto infants reported being unable to either prevent their children from being ejected from their grasp in the impact or locate their children in the darkness afterward. The NTSB held that, had the children been in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved child seats, many injuries might have been mitigated. Rescuers remarked that some infants were found smiling or seemingly unharmed. The NTSB was unable to accurately chart where individual passengers were seated because Avianca only assigned seats to a few passengers and many who were assigned reported moving after takeoff.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>seats</b> {{have been}} a matter of {{political}} dispute since the states first failed to reach an agreement at the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952. However, a final agreement between member states was reached in 1992, and later attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|This {{system of}} limited {{suffrage}} caused the predominantly Polish landowning class {{to dominate the}} Diet. Whilst they only made up about 0.4% of the population, they held 28.2% of <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> in the Diet. Small-scale rural landowners, on the other hand, made up about 95% of the population, but held only 52.3% of <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> in Diet. This system also skewed representation for different ethnicities in the Diet. Whilst Ruthenians made up about 40% {{of the population of}} Galicia, they only held 15% of <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> in the Diet, as they lived primarily in rural communities. Reform of the suffrage system in late 1913 added a fifth curia for the upper peasantry, which had the right to elect twenty deputies. Due to the outbreak of the First World War, no further elections to the Diet took place, and hence the fifth curia existed only on paper.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new {{integrated}} {{child safety}} seat {{is presented in}} this paper. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> is a two-mode seat for a motor vehicle cooperable with an adult seat belt assembly to provide two modes operation including an adult seat mode and a child <b>seat</b> mode. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> locates in <b>the</b> center of <b>the</b> rear <b>seat.</b> <b>The</b> structure of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> was designed in detail. The height of the booster of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> can be adjusted continuously according to <b>the</b> <b>seated</b> shoulder height of the child passenger. The depth of booster cushion also can be changed according {{to the size of}} the passenger. The sled test with <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> was conducted. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> simulation models with different booster heights were developed using MADYMO software and validated. Then, these models were used to study the performance of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> in frontal impact. Some key parameters of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> were studied in simulation test. The results of the test and simulation show that <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> can provide effective protection for the children aged from 3 to 10 years in frontal impact...|$|R

5|$|During its 2002 annual session, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) added 14 {{amendments}} to the Constitution of Indonesia. Included in these amendments were measures to reorganize the legislature. Beginning in 2004, the MPR was composed of the existing People's Representative Council (DPR) and a new Regional Representative Council (DPD). Because all <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> in the MPR were directly elected, this called for removal of the military from the legislature, whose 38 seats in the Assembly were appointed. This change and an amendment for direct election of the President and Vice President were major steps for Indonesia on the road towards a full democracy.|$|E
