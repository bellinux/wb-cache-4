5|$|Gray {{was born}} in Sauquoit, New York, on November 18, 1810, to Moses Gray (b.February26, 1786), then a tanner, and Roxanna Howard Gray (b. March 15, 1789). Born {{in the back of}} his father's <b>tannery,</b> Gray was the eldest of their eight children. Gray's {{paternal}} great-grandfather had arrived in Boston from Northern Ireland in 1718; Gray's Scotch-Irish Presbyterian ancestors had moved to New York from Massachusetts and Vermont after Shays' Rebellion. His parents married on July30, 1809. Tanneries needed a lot of wood to burn, and the lumber supply in the area had been shrinking, so Gray's father used his profits to buy farms in the area, and in about 1823 sold the <b>tannery</b> and became a farmer.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} 19th century {{there were several}} hundred <b>tanneries</b> in Sullivan county with several in Mamakating. The leather from these <b>tanneries</b> was of {{superior}} quality and {{during the civil war}} was used to make many of the boots, saddles and other leather goods used by the Union Army. In fact Mamakating <b>tanneries,</b> in the year 1850, produced 29,000 hides of leather from five water and horse powered <b>tanneries.</b>|$|R

It was run as a Gateway store and then as a Somerfield before closing in 2010. Aldi re-opened on the site in April 2014 following a major refurbishment of the store.|$|E
5|$|Early {{industries}} in the area included C & W Sheil's brickworks, which had quarries in Forbury, St Clair and Caversham, and Caversham Gasworks, which operated from 1882 until 1909. The last buildings of the gasworks were a local landmark, and were not removed until {{the construction of the}} Caversham bypass in the 1970s and 1980s. Other noted {{industries in}} early Caversham included breweries, a <b>tannery,</b> and a match factory.|$|E
5|$|In 1830, a forge {{which made}} bar iron {{was built on}} Nescopeck Creek. The most {{destructive}} flood on Nescopeck Creek occurred in 1850, when a dam on the creek was breached, killing 22 people. From 1858 to 1870 there was a <b>tannery</b> on Nescopeck Creek. In 1828, plans for a canal in Nescopeck Creek were made. In 1885, a number of French Indian artifacts, which were Plaster of Paris casts for making sculptures, were discovered along Nescopeck Creek in Dennison Township.|$|E

5|$|In {{its early}} years, Caversham was heavily industrialised, but also {{contained}} {{a large number}} of residential properties. The population included {{a large number of}} skilled tradespeople and craftspeople, and both large and small industries abounded. Local industries {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century included a brickworks, a gasworks, breweries, a smithy, milliners, several bakeries, a <b>tannery,</b> a bootmakers, and Rutherford's Wax Vesta match factory at Forbury Corner. In 1900, the South Road-David Street-Forbury Corner area was home to over 50 businesses.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1800s, a number of mills were built on tributaries of the creek. A number of other industries were established in the watershed in the early 1800s, including a sawmill, a woolen mill, an iron furnace, and a <b>tannery.</b> In {{the second half of the}} 1800s, railroads began to be built in the watershed. Heavy industries and fisheries also began to appear in the area around this time.|$|E
5|$|The Crow Green <b>tannery</b> was {{situated}} at the south-west end {{of the town and}} was already in existence in 1816. It had a water-powered bark mill and 47 tan pits at that date. It was owned by the Selwood family for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, who probably purchased it from James Whitby around 1830, and it was often referred to as Selwood's <b>tannery.</b> It suffered from fires in 1831, 1867 and 1958. In 1881 it employed 48 people and over 100 in 1958 (8% of the local workforce at the time). One of the major products of the factory in the nineteenth century was high-quality sole leather, but during the Second World War, only poor-quality hides, such as buffalo, were allocated to the firm. The business was badly damaged by the invention of rubber stick-on shoe soles which reduced the demand for sole leather from shoe repairers. It finally finished operation in 1967 when the leather side of the business was sold to a Yorkshire firm.|$|E

50|$|The Beardmores also opened <b>tanneries</b> {{in other}} parts of {{southern}} Ontario. By 1889, their main <b>tanneries</b> in Acton were very large, 100,000 square meters in size. They also built a large brick warehouse that year beside the railway tracks. Hides arrived by rail and were taken for processing by horse-drawn wagons and then shipped by rail to customers.|$|R
50|$|The {{complex is}} {{intended}} {{to serve as a}} central leather-tanning complex for Kolkata. There are about 500 <b>tanneries</b> in Kolkata and they perform 22-25% of all the tanning in India. The state of West Bengal is responsible for about 55% of India's leather exports. As of 2009, about 200 <b>tanneries</b> had relocated to the Calcutta Leather Complex.|$|R
5|$|The artist Thomas Addison Richards {{created a}} graphite-on-wove-paper drawing of Big Wapwallopen Creek in 1852. The Crystal Spring Water Company was {{chartered}} on April 11, 1861. It got its water supply {{from the upper}} reaches of the watershed of Big Wapwallopen Creek. In the 1800s, F.K. Miller constructed a <b>tannery</b> on a tributary of the creek in southeastern Dorrance Township. By 1865, the community of Dorrance had a gristmill, four sawmills, and a tavern on the creek.|$|E
5|$|The copper mines prospered {{for about}} seventy years, {{but by the}} early 17th century the {{industry}} was in decline. Demand for copper fell {{and the cost of}} extracting it was high. Graphite mining continued, and quarrying for slate began to grow in importance. Other small-scale industries grew up, such as <b>tannery</b> and weaving. Although the boom of the mid-16th century had finished, the town's economy did not slide into ruin, and the population remained generally constant at a little under 1,000.|$|E
5|$|Varanasi {{remained}} {{the centre of}} activity for intellectuals and theologians during the Middle Ages, which further contributed to its reputation as a cultural centre of religion and education. Several major figures of the Bhakti movement were born in Varanasi, including Kabir who was born here in 1389, and Ravidas, a 15th-century socio-religious reformer, mystic, poet, traveller, and spiritual figure, who was born and {{lived in the city}} and employed in the <b>tannery</b> industry.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the county}} {{line in the}} town of Caton, NY225 {{continues}} west through the gully for another , slowly rising in elevation as it heads past a small number of isolated homes. The creek reaches its source near NY225's junction with the southern terminus of CR34 (Whiskey Creek Road), at which point the route ascends out of the valley and heads southwest across lightly developed, relatively level terrain to the small hamlet of Caton. In the center of the community, NY225 intersects CR32 (Catonâ€“Seeley Creek Road) and CR120 (<b>Tannery</b> Creek Road). NY225 turns northwest at this intersection, becoming Caton Road as it follows Caton Creek out of the hamlet.|$|E
5|$|Between 1848 and 1852, land speculators {{laid out}} streets and {{commercial}} plots surrounding the new station. Industry, {{made possible by}} the railroad connections to major cities, soon arrived: a plow company in 1850, a <b>tannery</b> in 1854, and an iron foundry soon after. The city of Ayer, named after Groton-born James Cook Ayer, was incorporated from parts of Groton and Shirley in 1871; the railroad station was then renamed Ayer Junction. The station received a small expansion that year, and a covered island platform was built between the W tracks. The roof was rebuilt with new trusses; the former iron supporting pillars were used to construct the upper story of the nearby Spaulding Block.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{many of the}} sewers in the {{community}} of Eagles Mere discharged into tributaries of Muncy Creek, such as Outlet Run. Sewage was also discharged into Muncy Creek in Hugesville. Additionally, in the early 1900s, the waters of Muncy Creek were contaminated with <b>tannery</b> waste products from Muncy Valley and also chemicals. For this reason, the creek was only used for power during this time. Additionally, a methyl alcohol plant, the Nordmont Chemical Works, discharged chemicals into the creek at Nordstown. Other major industries in the watershed {{in the early part of}} the 1900s included clay mines and furniture factories.|$|E

Ten months later Hannah gave birth to their first child, a son. At a family {{gathering}} several weeks later the boy's name, Ulysses, was drawn from ballots placed in a hat. Wanting to honor his father-in-law, Jesse declared the boy to be Hiram Ulysses, though he would always refer to him as Ulysses.|$|E
5|$|Marysville's economy {{historically}} {{relied on}} lumber production and agriculture, including {{the cultivation of}} strawberries, hay and oats. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Marysville was not adversely impacted unlike other cities in the county and country because of its diverse industries, including sawmills, grain mills, a <b>tannery,</b> a fertilizer plant, and a berry packing plant. The city's largest employer in the early 1950s, the Weiser Lumber Company, was destroyed in a fire on May 6, 1955, causing $300,000 in damage. The lumber mill at the site was later acquired by Welco Lumber, who closed the plant in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The Cambridge Water Company were {{a company}} {{responsible}} for providing potable water to the inhabitants of Cambridge and the surrounding areas. In 1976, they purchased a borehole outside Sawston to deal with rising demand. In 1980, a European Directive was issued requiring nations of the European Community to establish standards {{on the presence of}} perchloroethene (PCE) in water, which the United Kingdom did in 1982. It was found that the Sawston borehole was contaminated with PCE that had originated in a <b>tannery</b> owned by Eastern Counties Leather. Prior to 1980, there was no knowledge that PCE should be avoided or that it could cause harm, but the Cambridge Water Company brought a case against Eastern Counties Leather anyway.|$|E
