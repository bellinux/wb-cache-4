This was an important advantage at a time when lubricants and their degradation were little understood.|$|R
40|$|We use light {{microscopy}} {{to investigate the}} aging dynamics of a glass made of closely packed soft spheres, following a rapid transition from a fluid to a solid-like state. By measuring time-resolved, coarse-grained displacements fields, we identify two classes of dynamical events, corresponding to reversible and irreversible rearrangements, respectively. The reversible events are due to the small, experimentally unavoidable fluctuations of the temperature imposed to the sample, leading to transient <b>thermal</b> <b>expansions</b> <b>and</b> <b>contractions</b> that cause shear deformations. The irreversible events are plastic rearrangements, induced by the repeated shear cycles. We show that the displacement due to the irreversible rearrangements grows linearly with time, both on average and at a local level. The velocity associated with this ballistic motion decreases exponentially with sample age, accounting for the observed slowing down of the dynamics. The displacement field due to the irreversible rearrangements has a vortex-like structure and is spatially correlated over surprisingly long distances.

25|$|Saint-Quentin-la-Poterie {{is about}} 5km north of Uzès and some 30km north of Nîmes. Joseph {{was one of}} ten {{children}} born to a family of horticulturists {{in the service of}} the duc d'Uzès. All hands being needed in the fields, Joseph was not sent to school. By the age of 17 he had proved his worth as a gardener, and the duke offered him a post at his mansion in Paris. Joseph took the opportunity to attend evening classes and learned to read and write. When friends of the duke began to ask his advice, his horizons widened and he started to make the high-level contacts that were to define his later career. In 1846 he left the duke's service to take up a post at the Tuileries Gardens near the Louvre. Responsible for the orangery, he began to look for a more durable form of container for the orange trees, which were moved from the open air into the greenhouses during the winter. He began to make them of cement (mixed with sand, cinders, and/or crushed firebricks) and reinforced them with a grid of iron rods. There was a general notion at the time that <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>and</b> <b>contraction</b> of embedded iron would rupture the concrete.

500|$|A parting line, sprue, gate marks, and {{ejector pin}} marks are usually {{present on the}} final part.

Gate marks occur at the gate which joins the melt-delivery channels (sprue and runner) to the part forming cavity. Parting line and ejector pin marks result from minute misalignments, wear, gaseous vents, clearances for adjacent parts in relative motion, and/or dimensional differences of the mating surfaces contacting the injected polymer. Dimensional differences can be attributed to non-uniform, pressure-induced deformation during injection, machining tolerances, and non-uniform <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>and</b> <b>contraction</b> of mould components, which experience rapid cycling during the injection, packing, cooling, and ejection phases of the process.

Wood rods expand less, losing only about 6 seconds per day for a [...] change, which is why quality clocks often had wooden pendulum rods. The wood had to be varnished to prevent water vapor from getting in, because changes in humidity also affected the length.|$|E

2500|$|Asphalt {{overlays}} {{are sometimes}} laid over distressed concrete {{to restore a}} smooth wearing surface. A disadvantage of this method is that movement in the joints between the underlying concrete slabs, whether from <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>and</b> <b>contraction,</b> or from deflection of the concrete slabs from truck axle loads, usually causes [...] reflective cracks in the asphalt. To decrease reflective cracking, concrete pavement is broken apart through a break and seat, crack and seat, or rubblization process. Geosynthetics {{can be used for}} reflective crack control. With break and seat and crack and seat processes, a heavy weight is dropped on the concrete to induce cracking, then a heavy roller is used to seat the resultant pieces into the subbase. The main difference between the two processes is the equipment used to break the concrete pavement {{and the size of the}} resulting pieces. The theory is frequent small cracks will spread thermal stress over a wider area than infrequent large joints, reducing the stress on the overlying asphalt pavement. Rubblization is a more complete fracturing of the old, worn-out concrete, effectively converting the old pavement into an aggregate base for a new asphalt road.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{selective}} laser melting process (SLM), belonging {{to the family of}} additive manufacturing processes, can create complex geometry parts from a CAD file. Previously, only prototypes were created by SLM, but now this process is used to manufacture quickly and directly functional parts. For example, in the PEP (Centre Technique de la Plasturgie), this process is used to manufacture tooling parts or injection molds with cooling channels that can’t be obtained by conventional routes. During the process, the laser beam generates violent heating and cooling cycles in the material inducing important thermal gradients in the consolidated part. The cyclic <b>thermal</b> <b>expansions</b> <b>and</b> <b>contractions</b> exceeding the maximum elastic strain of the material induce heterogeneous plastic strains and generate internal stresses the level of which can reaches the yield stress of the material and cracks may appear during the process. This paper deals with the measurement and analysis of residual stresses during the {{selective laser}} melting of a simple part in maraging steel. The objective of this study is the analysis of experimental results to validate the numerical model previously presented in [1]. A new method is proposed to evaluate the residual stresses induced during the SLM process, a rosette is fixed on the bottom face of the support. The residual stresses in the created part are calculated from strain and temperature variations when the fused layer is consolidating during the cooling between two layers. Process parameters like the powder thickness or the cooling time between successive layers are studied in this paper...|$|R

40|$|A rugged iris {{mechanism}} {{has been}} designed to satisfy several special requirements, including a wide aperture in the "open" position, full obscuration in the "closed" position, ability to function in a cryogenic or other harsh environment, and minimization of friction through minimization of the number of components. An important element of the low-friction aspect of the design is maximization of the flatness of, and provision of small gaps between, adjacent iris blades. The tolerances of the design can be very loose, accommodating <b>thermal</b> <b>expansions</b> <b>and</b> <b>contractions</b> associated with large temperature excursions. The design is generic in that it is adaptable {{to a wide range of}} aperture sizes and can be implemented in a variety of materials to suit the thermal, optical, and mechanical requirements of various applications. The mechanism (see figure) includes an inner flat ring, an outer flat ring, and an even number of iris blades. The iris blades shown in front in the figure are denoted as "upper," and the iris blades shown partly hidden behind the front ones are denoted as "lower. " Each iris blade is attached to the inner ring by a pivot assembly and to the outer ring by a roller/slider assembly. The upper and lower rings are co-centered and are kept in sliding contact. The iris is opened or closed by turning the outer ring around the center while holding the inner ring stationary. The mechanism is enclosed in a housing (not shown in the figure) that comprises an upper and a lower housing shell. The housing provides part of the sliding support for the outer ring and keeps the two rings aligned as described above. The aforementioned pivot assemblies at the inner ring also serve as spacers for the housing. The lower housing shell contains part of the lower sliding surface and features for mounting the overall mechanism and housing assembly.

This paper discusses the efficiency of using FEM, based on the isothermal calorimetry results, for predicting early-age temperature development of in situ concrete.
