40|$|The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the chemical and physical stability of cinnarizine within self-emulsifying drug delivery systems. According to International Conference of Harmonization guidelines, <b>the</b> selected <b>formulations</b> were enrolled into both accelerated and long-term stability studies up to 6 and 12 months, respectively. The chemical stability of <b>the</b> <b>formulations</b> was assessed periodically based on the intact cinnarizine level. The physical stability was evaluated based on the physical appearance and color change pattern of <b>the</b> <b>formulations.</b> <b>The</b> accelerated stability study revealed significant cinnarizine degradation in all <b>the</b> tested <b>formulations</b> at 3 and 6 months. All <b>the</b> tested <b>formulations</b> experienced sharp discoloration within 6 months of storage. On the other hand, the long-term stability study showed no significant cinnarizine degradation or color change within <b>the</b> <b>formulations</b> containing 100 % saturated medium chain glycerides (as oil component). While, <b>the</b> <b>formulations</b> containing 50 % unsaturated long chain fatty acids showed considerable drug degradation as well as significant discoloration. Accordingly, <b>The</b> <b>formulations</b> containing 100 % saturated medium chain glycerides provide excellent chemical and physical stability pattern and have the potential to provide a stable dosage form of cinnarizine...|$|R
40|$|Omeprazole {{is widely}} used in the {{treatment}} of equine gastric ulcer syndrome. To date, {{little is known about the}} relative pharmacokinetics of <b>the</b> different <b>formulations</b> making comparisons between products difficult. The objectives of the study were to investigate the relative pharmacokinetics of five commercially available formulations of omeprazole in the horse and to test for bioequivalence of four of <b>the</b> <b>formulations</b> using one of <b>the</b> <b>formulations</b> as a reference standard. Twelve mature Thoroughbred horses were fasted for 16 h then administered 2 g of each formulation in a cross-over design. Serial blood samples were collected and plasma omeprazole concentration was determined by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). No significant differences were present between three of <b>the</b> <b>formulations</b> and <b>the</b> reference <b>formulation,</b> while <b>the</b> fourth <b>formulation</b> had a lower C-max and longer T-max than <b>the</b> reference <b>formulation.</b> Bioequivalence against <b>the</b> reference <b>formulation</b> could not be demonstrated for any of <b>the</b> <b>formulations</b> tested. <b>The</b> findings of the study suggested that the method of protection utilised by different formulations of omeprazole (enteric-coated granules vs. buffering) does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Further work to establish bioequivalence is needed before direct comparisons can be drawn between different formulations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{comparison}} of two compositional reservoir simulation <b>formulations</b> is presented. <b>The</b> first <b>formulation</b> {{is based on an}} implicit pressure and explicit concentration (IMPEC) procedure and <b>the</b> second <b>formulation</b> uses an implicit pressure and implicit saturation (IMPSAT) for the solution of the governing partial differential equations. Our main goal was to compare <b>the</b> <b>formulations</b> in terms of computational times for solving 2 D and 3 D compositional reservoir simulation case studies. Both single point upstream weighting and third-order schemes for discretization of the partial differential equations were implemented for <b>the</b> <b>formulations.</b> <b>The</b> computational results for <b>the</b> abovementioned <b>formulations</b> for several case studies involving homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoirs are presented in this paper...|$|R

Several leading divines, either Calvinist or those sympathetic to Calvinism, settled in England (Martin Bucer, Peter Martyr, and Jan Laski) and Scotland (John Knox). During the English Civil War, the Calvinistic Puritans produced the Westminster Confession, which became the confessional standard for Presbyterians in the English-speaking world.|$|E
