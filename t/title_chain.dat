40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{determination}} of the spin density in the ferrimagnetic ground state of the bimetallic chain compound MnCu(pba) (H 2 O) (3). 2 H(2) O, with pba = 1, 3 -propylenebis(oxamato). The crystal structure, previously determined at room temperature through X-ray diffraction, was redetermined at 10 K through unpolarized neutron diffraction (orthorhombic system, space group Pnma, a = 12. 727 (11) Angstrom, b = 21. 352 (19) Angstrom, c = 5. 153 (3) Angstrom, Z = 4). The experimental spin density has been deduced from polarized neutron diffraction data recorded at 10 K under 50 kOe. Positive spin densities were observed on the manganese side and negative spin densities on the copper side. The delocalization of the spin density from the metal centers toward the oxamato bridging ligand was found to be more pronounced on the copper side than on the manganese side, so that the nodal surface (of zero spin density) is closer to manganese than to copper. The experimental spin distribution has been compared to the theoretical distributions deduced from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, using both DGauss and DMol programs. The experimental results for the <b>title</b> <b>chain</b> compound have also been compared to the spin distribution for the binuclear compound [Mn(Me- 6 -[14]ane-N- 4) Cu(oxpn) ](CF 3 SO 3) (2) with Me- 6 -[14]ane-N- 4 = (+/-) - 5, 7, 7, 12, 14, 14 -hexamethyl- 1, 4, 8, 11 -tetraazacyclotetradecane, and oxpn = N,N'-bis(3 -aminopropyl) oxamido, recently reported. The most striking difference between pair and chain compounds concerns the positive P+ and negative P- spin populations carried by the manganese and copper sides, respectively. For the pair compound P+ was found as 4. 67 (8) mu(B), and P- as - 0. 67 (8) mu(B) while for the chain compound these values are 5. 05 (7) mu(B) and - 1. 05 (10) mu(B), respectively.

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{a characteristic}} of property entitlements fundamental {{to the structure of}} property systems that has received scant academic attention, a characteristic referred to as the mutual exclusivity principle. According to this principle, a property system does not allow for the existence of incompatible rights. Two people cannot separately be the owners of the same resource, for instance. By contrast, two people can each hold valid but contradictory contract rights to the resource. Although the existing property literature has stressed the “exclusive” nature of property, the various ways in which property is imagined to be exclusive, such as by conferring “rights to exclude,” fail to capture the essence of property as a distinct legal institution. Unlike these alternative conceptions of exclusiveness, the mutual exclusivity principle holds true across the range of different types of property entitlements, including not just fee simple ownership but also security interests and servitudes, and across the range of assets subject to property law, including not just land and physical objects but also intangibles like intellectual property and corporate shares. Recognizing the role of the mutual exclusivity principle yields a number of practical insights. It helps explain various institutional features of property law, such as the system of future interests, the use of possession-based rules, the role of recording systems, and the negative, thing-based structure of property entitlements. It illuminates connections between property and other fields like corporations law and it calls into question aspects of existing doctrine, such as the preferred status of exclusion rights under the U. S. Constitution’s Takings Clause. It also modifies the influential theory that property law is heavily shaped by problems of high information costs: while existing accounts seem to suppose that property law entails relatively high information costs because it imposes a relatively broad set of duties on others, many of the information cost problems identified in the literature actually result from the mutual exclusivity problem, rather than from the breadth of property duties. At a more general level, understanding the centrality of the mutual exclusivity principle suggests some change in direction is called for within the wider property literature. American property scholarship has been preoccupied with questions about the scope and strength of property rights, overlooking the separate problem of ascertaining who happens to hold a given right, a problem distinctive to property law. Property, this Article argues, is at least as much about <b>title</b> <b>chains,</b> patent searches, and creditor priorities as it is about trespass, remedies, and eminent domain...|$|R

5000|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{involvement}} at CCRMA, the French Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM) offered Reynolds a commission and residency, which was followed up by two more residences {{over the course}} of two decades. When he first went to IRCAM, he made the choice to utilize technologically expert assistants to create software or hardware solutions to specific musical ideas inherent in his compositions. This practice has since spawned many collaborative ventures with various musical assistants, as Reynolds notes:When I went to IRCAM ... there was this concept of the Musical Assistant. ... I realized right away that this allowed me to make a choice: whether I would decide to spend a few years not composing and learning what I would need to do to become a self-sufficient computer-music composer or that I was going to collaborate with other people.collaboration: You enter into a relationship with one or more people and you have to sacrifice some of your autonomy and they have to sacrifice some of theirs {{in order to get to}} a place that you couldn’t get without each other. And I like that kind of situation.Archipelago (1982-83) was one of the first works that Reynolds did that used technology to drastically alter not only the sounds of the composition, but also the process of composing. The impetus was as the <b>title</b> suggests, a <b>chain</b> of islands, an idea which Reynolds elaborated on with a simultaneous theme and variations process. With fifteen themes and their own variations, distributed unevenly over a thirty-two member chamber orchestra, Reynolds needed technology to transform both the timbres and the order of the sounds in ways that live performers could not. This was the first time that Reynolds spent a great deal of time working with computers to transform musical material, along with spatialization, he used a process [...] "in which he was trying to take recognizable kernels and weave them into a mosaic of interacting transformations." [...] IRCAM was an extremely fertile environment for composition, allowing the Archipelago project to thrive:...The process composing the piece was interactive because I was at IRCAM and had the privilege of working with a very smart young composer, Thierry Lancino, who was my musical assistant, and also consulting with people like David Wessel and Stephen McAdams and so on. It was an astonishing opportunity. But in this case, the tie between the impetus, the medium, and the need for technology was absolutely clear. If one listens to the piece, one hears that technology was needed and also that it works.Odyssey (1989-93), primarily composed during the early 1990s, incorporates two singers, two speakers, instrumental ensemble, and six-channel computer sound. [...] "Odyssey required me to settle on an ideal set of multilingual Beckett texts by means of which to portray the course of his life." [...] There was a chaotic element in the text that Reynolds wished to portray in the music, and he undertook some of the first experiments with using strange attractors (specifically the Lorenz attractor) in music with this composition, citing influence from James Gleick. Reynolds notes that the process of creating musically beguiling results from a strange attractor was [...] "arduous" [...] and [...] "grueling." ...|$|R
