(A small strip of connecting territory {{is included in the}} Southern Oregon AVA to make it a contiguous region; however, this strip passes through mountains regions not suitable for vineyards.) This AVA was established in 2004 to allow the <b>two</b> <b>principal</b> regions in Southern Oregon to jointly market themselves.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{exhausted}} the JNA {{and proved}} {{a turning point}} in the Croatian war. A ceasefire was declared a few weeks later. Vukovar remained in Serb hands until 1998, when it was peacefully reintegrated into Croatia. It has since been rebuilt but has less than half of its pre-war population and many buildings are still scarred by the battle. Its <b>two</b> <b>principal</b> ethnic communities remain deeply divided and it has not regained its former prosperity.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{games of}} incomplete information where a common agent sequentially interacts with <b>two</b> <b>principals.</b> In this setting {{we show that}} the Revelation Principle applies: there is no loss of generality in assuming that the <b>two</b> <b>principals</b> restrict attention to direct revelation mechanisms. This result contrasts sharply with standard simultaneous common agency games in which the Revelation Principle is usually invalid. We provide a general model of sequential common agency under asymmetric information and we characterize the unique pure-strategy equilibrium in deterministic contracts for complementary decisions. Finally, we endogenize the information flow between the <b>two</b> <b>principals.</b> We show that the Stackelberg leader can benefit from committing to a mechanism that (partially) signals the agent's private information to the second principal. ...|$|R

The <b>two</b> <b>principal</b> entrances to the mansion in the centre of both the north and south facades were accessed by external staircases, originally a single broad flight on the north side and a double staircase on the south. These staircases have since been replaced by simpler designs.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of increasing contact with Kaminaljuyu, which emerged as a principal centre at this time, linking the Pacific coastal trade routes with the Motagua River route, as well as increased contact with other sites along the Pacific coast. Within this extended trade route, Takalik Abaj and Kaminaljuyu {{appear to have been}} the <b>two</b> <b>principal</b> foci. The early Maya style of sculpture spread throughout this network.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Mehldau {{moved to}} New York City in 1988 to study jazz and {{contemporary}} music at The New School. He studied under pianists Fred Hersch, Junior Mance and Kenny Werner, and drummer Jimmy Cobb. In 1989 Mehldau {{was part of}} saxophonist Christopher Hollyday's band that toured for several months; {{as a result of}} playing so often with one group, Mehldau was able to assimilate the music of Wynton Kelly and McCoy Tyner, his <b>two</b> <b>principal</b> influences on piano up to that point, and began to develop his own sound. Before the age of 20 Mehldau also had gigs in Cobb's band, along with fellow student Peter Bernstein on guitar.|$|E

5|$|As {{one of the}} <b>two</b> <b>principal</b> {{common law}} courts along with the Common Pleas, the King's Bench's {{jurisdiction}} and caseload was significantly challenged {{by the rise of}} the Court of Chancery and equitable doctrines in the 15th and 16th centuries. To recover, the King's Bench undertook a scheme of revolutionary reform, creating less expensive, faster and more versatile types of pleading in the form of bills as opposed to the more traditional writs. Although not immediately stemming the tide, in the long term it helped the King's Bench not only recover but increase its workload. While there was a steep decline in business from 1460 to 1540, as the new reforms began to take effect the King's Bench's business was significantly boosted; between 1560 and 1640, it rose tenfold.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} <b>two</b> <b>principal</b> {{common law}} courts with the King's Bench, the Common Pleas fought to {{maintain}} its jurisdiction and caseload, {{in a way that}} during the 16th and 17th centuries was categorised as conservative and reactionary. Reaching an acceptable medium with the King's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas proved to be the downfall of all three courts; with several courts of near-identical jurisdiction, there was little need for separate bodies, and the superior courts of Westminster were merged by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 into a single High Court of Justice. With an Order in Council issued on 16 December 1880, the Common Pleas Division of the High Court ceased to exist, marking the end of the Court of Common Pleas.|$|E
5|$|Brettingham {{moved on}} to other projects. In the 1760s, he was {{approached}} by his most illustrious patron, the Duke of York (brother of King George III), to design one of the greatest mansions in Pall Mall, namely York House. The rectangular mansion that Brettingham designed was built in the Palladian style on <b>two</b> <b>principal</b> floors, with the state rooms as at Norfolk House, arranged in a circuit around the central staircase hall. The house was a mere pastiche of Norfolk House, but for Brettingham it had the kudos of a royal occupant.|$|E

The NSLPK authentication protocol {{is based on}} the public-key cryptosystem. <b>Two</b> <b>principals</b> can use the protocol to achieve the mutual authentication between them. The successful completion of the message exchanges specified by the protocol lets <b>two</b> <b>principals</b> share some information. The secrecy property is as follows: even when there exist malicious principals, the information is never leaked to any third parties. Described is the verification with proof score that the protocol satisfies the (nonce) secrecy property...|$|R

5|$|Croatia has a {{civil law}} legal {{system in which}} law arises {{primarily}} from written statutes, with judges serving merely as implementers, and not creators of law. Its development was largely influenced by German and Austrian legal systems. Croatian law is divided into <b>two</b> <b>principal</b> areas – private and public law. By the time EU accession negotiations were completed on 30 June 2010, Croatian legislation was fully harmonised with the Community acquis. The main law in the county is the Constitution adopted on December 22, 1990.|$|E
5|$|In {{between the}} Argo and the Trojan War, {{there was a}} {{generation}} known chiefly for its horrific crimes. This includes the doings of Atreus and Thyestes at Argos. Behind {{the myth of the}} house of Atreus (one of the <b>two</b> <b>principal</b> heroic dynasties with the house of Labdacus) lies the problem of the devolution of power and of the mode of accession to sovereignty. The twins Atreus and Thyestes with their descendants played the leading role in the tragedy of the devolution of power in Mycenae.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Opera is {{a company}} based in central London, {{resident}} at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Along with the English National Opera, {{it is one of}} the <b>two</b> <b>principal</b> opera companies in London. Founded in 1946 as the Covent Garden Opera Company, it was known by that title until 1968. It brought a long annual season and consistent management to a house that had previously hosted short seasons under a series of impresarios. Since its inception, it has shared the Royal Opera House with the dance company now known as The Royal Ballet.|$|E
5|$|The oral {{legends and}} texts {{initiate}} {{a process of}} Sanskritization of the folk deity Khandoba by elevating him to the classical Hindu god Shiva; his <b>two</b> <b>principal</b> wives Mhalsa and Banai are equated to Parvati and Ganga. Banai {{does not appear in}} the Sanskrit Malhari Mahatmya, the main scripture related to Khandoba, however it mentions Ganga arriving from heaven. Banai (Ganga) has a quarrel with Mhalsa (Parvati), ultimately ending with the message that both are the same. Some Dhangars consider Banai also to be a form of Parvati.|$|E
5|$|The <b>two</b> <b>principal</b> drafters {{and architects}} of the {{covenant}} of the League of Nations were Lord Robert Cecil (a British diplomat), and Jan Smuts (a South African statesman).

He also proposed the creation of a Mandate system for captured colonies of the Central Powers during the war. Cecil focused on the administrative side, and proposed annual Council meetings and quadrennial meetings for the Assembly of all members. He also argued for a large and permanent secretariat to carry out the League's administrative duties.|$|E
