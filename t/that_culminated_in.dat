5|$|By {{the early}} 18th century, the Antemoro had {{established}} themselves as major rice and slave exporters. Throughout the 1700s, the Antemoro were {{embroiled in a}} conflict with the Ikongo-Tanala <b>that</b> <b>culminated</b> <b>in</b> a bloody Tanala invasion of the eastern coastal plain.

5|$|The {{political}} {{freedom of the}} American republic exerted a similar pull. Swedish peasants {{were some of the}} most literate in Europe, and consequently had access to the European egalitarian and radical ideas <b>that</b> <b>culminated</b> <b>in</b> the Revolutions of 1848. The clash between Swedish liberalism and a repressive monarchist regime raised political awareness among the disadvantaged, many of whom looked to the U.S. to realize their republican ideals.|$|E

5|$|From this {{changing}} society emerged a common, unifying musical language, {{in particular}} the polyphonic style of the Franco-Flemish school. The development of printing made distribution of music possible on a wide scale. Demand for music as entertainment and as an activity for educated amateurs increased {{with the emergence of}} a bourgeois class. Dissemination of chansons, motets, and masses throughout Europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style <b>that</b> <b>culminated</b> <b>in</b> {{the second half of the}} sixteenth century in the work of composers such as Palestrina, Lassus, Victoria and William Byrd.|$|E

5|$|The {{role of the}} Rova as a seat {{of power}} for the Kingdom of Imerina changed when Andriamasinavalona chose to divide the kingdom into four provinces ruled by his {{favourite}} sons. Antananarivo became {{the capital of the}} southern Imerina province with the Rova as its seat of government. The site retained this role until the late 18th century, when King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810) of Ambohimanga led a series of attacks beginning in 1792 <b>that</b> <b>culminated</b> <b>in</b> the capture of Antananarivo and its incorporation into the newly reunified Kingdom of Imerina.|$|E

The politically motivated killing of a white man, Petrus Oberholzer, near Melsetter by ZANU insurgents on 4 July 1964 marked the start of intensified black nationalist violence and police counteraction <b>that</b> <b>culminated</b> <b>in</b> the banning of ZANU and PCC/ZAPU on 26 August, {{with most of the}} two movements' respective leaders concurrently jailed or restricted. ZANU, ZAPU and their respective guerrilla armies—the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)—thereafter operated from abroad.|$|E

General Jubal Early looted and vandalized the Forge, causing a loss to Stevens of about $80,000. Early said that the North {{had done the same}} to southern figures, and that Stevens was well known for his vindictiveness towards the South. Asked if he would have taken the congressman to Libby Prison in Richmond, Early replied that he would have hanged Stevens and divided his bones among the Confederate states.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} months of 1781, both pro-British and separatist forces began concentrating in Virginia, a state that had {{previously}} not experienced more than naval raids. The British forces were led at first by the turncoat Benedict Arnold, and then by William Phillips before General Charles, Earl Cornwallis, arrived in late May with his southern army to take command. In June he marched to Williamsburg, where he received a confusing series of orders from General Sir Henry Clinton <b>that</b> <b>culminated</b> <b>in</b> a directive to establish a fortified deep-water port (which would allow resupply by sea). In response to these orders, Cornwallis moved to Yorktown in late July, where his army began building fortifications. The presence of these British troops, coupled with General Clinton's desire for a port there, made control of the Chesapeake Bay an essential naval objective for both sides.|$|E

5|$|In December 1999, RFC 2732 {{provided}} a minor update to RFC 2396, allowing URIs to accommodate IPv6 addresses.

While obsoleting the prior standard, it did not render the details of existing URL schemes obsolete; RFC 1738 continues to govern such schemes except where otherwise superseded. RFC 2616 for example, refines the http scheme. Simultaneously, the IETF published the content of RFC 3986 as the full standard STD 66, reflecting {{the establishment of the}} URI generic syntax as an official Internet protocol.|$|E
