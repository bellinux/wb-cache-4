40|$|Under {{the action}} of {{internal}} pressure compressive circumferential stresses develop in the knuckle region of <b>torispherical</b> <b>heads</b> making them susceptible to buckling. Current pressure vessel design codes such as the European Unfired pressure vessel code MSA EN 13445 Part 3 present buckling as a failure mode {{that needs to be}} prevented. The latest version of the code has a Design by Analysis route that requires the designer to perform a buckling check on the design model. This study considers the different design approaches (Design by Analysis and Design by Rule) presented in MSA EN 13445 Part 3 and compares computational results with experimental data available from literature. The study shows that the pressure vessel design code MSA EN 13445 Part 3 guarantees that the calculated design load will not subject <b>torispherical</b> <b>heads</b> to buckling in the knuckle region, under {{the action of}} internal pressure...|$|R
40|$|Mild-steel vessels with {{initially}} flat ends, having {{four different}} thicknesses and various knuckle shapes, {{have been formed}} without dies. Similar shapes were obtained by forming at room temperature and at a high temperature with saturated steam as the pressurizing medium. The elastic stresses due to internal pressure in 24 pressure-formed vessels have been analysed using frozen stress photoelastic models. The peak stresses in these shapes are generally lower than in the best <b>torispherical</b> <b>heads</b> of the same head height...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Two {{important}} {{parameters of}} <b>torispherical</b> <b>head</b> that are i R (interior radius of spherical crown area) and r (interior radius of transition corner) have been optimized by the module {{of the large}} general-purpose finite-element software ANSYS, targeting the strength and stability of the head. This paper provides an optimized <b>torispherical</b> <b>head,</b> which improves {{the stability of the}} edge of the head with acceptable strength of the head. The procedure is generally applicable as a design tool for optimal design. ...|$|E

Furthermore, unsatisfying results from basics formulas of cylindrical and spherical shell, lead us to use standards methods: ASME code and Indian standards to design <b>torispherical</b> <b>head</b> tank. Then obtained results showed that, design a tank with <b>torispherical</b> <b>head</b> by ASME code is more safety than Indian standards. It was proved that, Indian standards is the most economic, because the life consumption of tank is only 3, 8...|$|E
40|$|The article {{describes}} the remedy for a misalignment of Y-joint in hemispherical and <b>torispherical</b> <b>heads</b> of the bilobe cargo tank on a Liquefi ed Petroleum Gas Carrier. The misalignment {{is the result of}} connecting relatively thin shells and production diffi culties. The measured rather large shell eccentricity in the Y-joint causes bending moment, which cannot be withstood by shells designed as membrane, and therefore it has to be controlled. The remedy of misalignment is achieved by reinforcement of the Y-joint with inside and outside bars and knees. In this way stress concentration determined by the FEM analysis is reduced within the allowable stress given for secondary stress level...|$|R
40|$|Thin shell <b>torispherical</b> {{pressure}} vessel <b>heads</b> {{are known to}} exhibit complex elastic-plastic deformation and buckling behaviour under static pressure. In {{pressure vessel}} Design by Analysis, the designer is required to assess both of these behaviour modes when specifying the allowable static load. The EN and ASME boiler and pressure vessel codes {{permit the use of}} inelastic analysis in design by analysis, known as the direct route in the EN Code. In this paper, plastic collapse or gross plastic deformation loads are evaluated for two sample <b>torispherical</b> <b>heads</b> by 2 D and 3 D FEA based on an elastic-perfectly plastic material model. Small and large deformation effects are considered in the 2 D analyses and the effect of geometry and load perturbation are considered in the 3 D analysis. The plastic load is determined by applying the ASME twice elastic slope criterion of plastic collapse and an alternative plastic criterion, the Plastic Work Curvature criterion. The formation of the gross plastic deformation mechanism in the models is considered in relation to the elastic-plastic buckling response of the vessels. It is concluded that in both cases, design is limited by formation of an axisymmetric gross plastic deformation in the knuckle of the vessels prior to formation of non-axisymmetric buckling modes...|$|R
40|$|The {{well-known}} {{problem of}} the elastic analysis of cylindrical pressure vessels with hemispherical, <b>torispherical</b> and ellipsoidal <b>heads,</b> involving the partial differential equations for the classical theory of thin shells of revolution axisymmetric in character, is attempted here using a step. by-step integration procedure and a segmentation technique. The numerical results are obtained with a generalised computer program {{for a number of}} cases and for a given set of values of elastic moduli, Poisson's ratio and thickness/diameter ratio. The results are compared with the known results available in literature and also with the stresses predicted by the. 4 SME Code...|$|R
40|$|The elastic {{instability}} of an internally-pressurized cylindrical tank with a <b>torispherical</b> <b>head</b> is investigated using a triangular, doubly curved, thin-shell finite element. The {{formulation of the}} finite element, which is based upon cubic displacement functions and a modified principle of potential energy, is first described. Then, the element is verified by comparing numerical results for the linear, stable analysis to alternative solutions for the same problem. The subsequent instability investigation includes {{the solution of the}} linearized problem of equilibrium bifurcation, that is, of the classical eigenvalue problem, and a general nonlinear analysis, based on tracing the nonlinear load-displacement path. The critical pressure, obtained with use of the general nonlinear analysis, agrees closely with an experimental result as well as with a numerical solution stemming from an axisymmetric formulation...|$|E
