25|$|Gerard may be {{considered}} {{one of the founders of}} botany in English language, but he was not well educated, was more interested as a herbalist and barber-surgeon in the medicinal properties of the plants than botanical theory and was not notable as a botanist in terms of technical knowledge in his own time according to his critics. Amongst these was John Ray, who commented that despite the fact that the book was the standard botany text in the seventeenth century, it was the work of an ignorant man, and that lacking any foreign languages he could not have translated the work. Because it was a practical and useful book, packed with helpful drawings of plants, and because Gerard had a fluid and lively writing manner, his Herball was popular with ordinary literate people in 17th-century England. Although it was recognised amongst scholars that it was a pirated work, with many limitations, at that time there is evidence of the book still being in practical use as a medicinal herbal, even in the early 19th century. Agnes Arber recounts a story of a man born in 1842 that in his childhood <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who used the Herball for treating the ailments of her neighbours.|$|E
500|$|However, {{due to the}} {{shifting}} images that Madonna presented, O'Brien was confused as to how she can approach writing the biography. She found that analyzing Madonna's music was a helpful method. The author then interviewed dancers, choreographers, musicians, and producers who worked with Madonna. While talking to them, O'Brien reflected on her own childhood and found parallels with Madonna—being born in a Catholic family and gradually becoming aware {{of the rise of}} feminism and gay liberation. She kept getting two stark pictures of the artist as her [...] "search for Madonna became maddening", stating [...] "There was the woman who was ruthless in moving on and rude to the competition, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> I'd never seen before– sweet, childlike and captivating." ...|$|E

And <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> dragging a string of kids who said, very angrily, 'You should all be married and have children like me.'" [...] Leaflets were distributed to passersby that described their reasons for picketing, surprising some recipients who were unaware gays and lesbians could be fired so easily, and disgusting others. Gittings remembered, [...] "It was risky and we were scared. Picketing was not a popular tactic at the time. And our cause seemed outlandish even to most gay people." [...] The evening prior to the group's picketing the State Department, Secretary of State Dean Rusk announced the pickets at a press conference. Gittings connected the high-profile visibility with a [...] "breakthrough into mainstream publicity." ...|$|E
500|$|According to a belief, {{the power}} of dragon boys was {{greatest}} {{at the time of}} their birth; the younger they were, the greater power they had. In a folk tale from eastern Serbia, a group of dragons surrounded an ala, which broke away and flew into a watermill. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> in the mill with her baby, who was a dragon boy; he grabbed a stone and killed the ala with it. It was recorded in the region of Niš that a winged dragon boy, in his fights with ale, [...] "takes a plough beam and immediately stops the ala, and hail ceases." [...] The mother of a dragon boy wanted to make him an ordinary child by cutting off the winglets beneath his armpits, but that section resulted in the boy's death. As was thought in the Župa basin and nearby areas, no one but the mother should see a dragon boy during the first seventeen days of his life; otherwise the child would die. If he survived, he would protect his village from hail, and at the age of seven he would fly away from home. It was also believed in Župa that the dragon men lived alone, without contacts with other humans.|$|E
500|$|Martínez {{contacted}} Garza, {{who knew}} two hitmen from Matamoros who could {{carry out the}} job. Cisneros then gave Martínez photo of Fischer, who {{passed it on to}} Garza. Garza contacted Israel Olivarez Cepeda and Heriberto [...] "Eddie" [...] Puentes Pizaña to carry out the murder. Garza had met them in Brownsville at Olivarez' uncle's house. During the last week of January, Garza met them again at a restaurant in Grand Prairie, Texas while he was working with Cuellar and Moya. Garza told Olivarez that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> in Brownsville willing to pay someone to kill Fischer. Olivarez said he was interested in the job and stayed in contact with Garza. Olivarez and Puentes Pizaña were part of a cross-border drug trafficking and car theft ring that stretched from Mexico to Chicago. This organization was headed by Cuellar, the same man whose bond application was investigated by the Brownsville police after the business card was discovered at Fischer's house. Garza met the two again in Dallas on February 14 to describe the murder plans. They were given Fischer's photo, a map with the address, and promised that they would do as they had been told on their next trip to Brownsville. On March 2, the night before the murder, Garza was traveling from San Fernando, Tamaulipas, Mexico, to San Antonio and bumped into the two at a motel in Brownsville. Olivarez asserted that he was ready to carry out the plan.|$|E

2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> and I {{remember}} {{that she was}} a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we sat there for a while, and then I went along. And, as little as I was, I thought, [...] "I'd like to be like that kind of person. I'd like to be like her." [...] I think it influenced my entire life, a little thing.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{women were}} thought to be able to {{eliminate}} the danger from destructive weather. This was the case with Stana Tomić, a healer from Jarmenovci in the municipality of Topola. Her fellow villagers held her in high esteem and claimed that she saved Jarmenovci from hail many times. At the sight of hail clouds, she would place the dining table at the center of her house, before putting on it a piece of bread, salt, and the lighted candle that had been used during the celebration of the slava. She would then go out into the yard and shout: [...] "ORadomir, hanged man, lead the kolo around. Turn those white cattle back there, do not let them come here. Here is a bigger prodigy: a girl of seven years old bore a child, wrapped it in silken diapers, bound it with a silken ribbon. Do not let harm come to our vineyards, do not let harm come to our fruitful fields." [...] In 1956, when this was recorded, Stana had been protecting Jarmenovci in this way for thirty years. In the regions of Takovo and Užice, people claimed that some villages had never been ravaged by hail, because in each of them <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> that prevented it.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2002, it was {{announced}} that Bradley Bell had decided to kill off Taylor, and Tylo would depart the role after twelve years. In a statement on her website, she wrote: [...] "It is with great sadness I {{have to tell you that}} Brad has decided to kill off the character Taylor. He feels the character is too good and has too much integrity to take her down other pathsin a word, played out." [...] The actress confessed that she was unhappy with her character's direction at the time of her exit, saying: [...] "I really felt like Taylor had lost the wind from her sails and was going nowhere." [...] Tylo said that [...] "It just seemed like everything had to do with whether or not <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> after her husband" [...] and that she was [...] "done with it", revealing that her unhappiness with the writing began when the character of Morgan appeared on the show. Furthermore, both Tylo and Bell agreed that Taylor was at a [...] "brick wall", but Bell was [...] "afraid to go beyond that" [...] and have the character go [...] "off the deep end", in fear of destroying her integrity. However, Tylo believed that [...] "in reality that's what she needed – to be more human. But she just got boring instead". Taylor is gunned down by Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) and appears to die in hospital a few days later due to her injuries. Tylo eventually returned to the soap, with Taylor revealed to be alive in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{story about}} another “Molly” who {{distinguished}} {{herself on the}} battlefield has come down {{to us from the}} Battle of Monmouth, which was fought on a sweltering day in late June 1778. [...] According to the legend of Molly Pitcher, Mary Hays, the wife of William Hays, a soldier in Proctor’s 4th Continental Artillery, was bringing pitchers of water from a nearby spring to the cannon crews when she saw her husband collapse. [...] Mary is then reported to have picked up the rammer, joined the gun crew, and continued to work the cannon {{for the rest of the}} battle. [...] It is further reported that for her heroism General Washington warranted her as a non-commissioned officer and awarded her a pension for life. [...] There are eyewitness accounts that verify that Mary was present at the battle, that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> bringing water to the cannon crews, and that a woman was seen assisting her husband at a gun. [...] There is no record of any woman receiving a military title after the battle or any record of Mary receiving a federal pension (although she did receive a pension from the State of Pennsylvania for her war service, not her husband’s). [...] Her contemporaries referred to Mary as “Captain Molly” or “Sergeant Molly,” not as “Molly Pitcher.” [...] The name “Molly Pitcher” appeared in print for the first time in 1837 and was greatly popularized by the painting “Molly Pitcher: Heroine of Monmouth,” by Nathaniel Currier. [...] William Hays survived the war, after which he and Mary settled in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. [...] William died in 1789, after which Mary married another Revolutionary War veteran, George McCauley. [...] She died in 1832, and is buried in Carlisle.|$|E
