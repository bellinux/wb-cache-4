25|$|Morphy is chiefly {{remembered as}} a leading {{exponent}} of the Romantic school of chess, which focused on 1. e4 openings and dashing tactical play where opponents were often checkmated in under 30 moves. However, many of his most picturesque games came against weak opponents, and these games are <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>most</b> commonly reprinted in chess books. Morphy's contemporaries considered him less exciting of a player than earlier giants such as Pierre La Bourdonnais and Adolf Anderssen.|$|E

25|$|Thus, Hillel called {{attention}} to seven commonly used hermeneutical principles {{in the interpretation of}} laws (baraita at the beginning of Sifra); R. Ishmael, thirteen (baraita at the beginning of Sifra; this collection is largely an amplification of that of Hillel). Eliezer b. Jose ha-Gelili listed 32, largely used for the exegesis of narrative elements of Torah. All the hermeneutic rules scattered through the Talmudim and Midrashim have been collected by Malbim in Ayyelet ha-Shachar, the introduction to his commentary on the Sifra. Nevertheless, R. Ishmael's 13 principles are perhaps <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>most</b> widely known; they constitute an important, and one of Judaism's earliest, contributions to logic, hermeneutics, and jurisprudence. Judah Hadassi incorporated Ishmael's principles into Karaite Judaism in the 12th century. Today R. Ishmael's 13 principles are incorporated into the Jewish prayer book to be read by observant Jews on a daily basis.|$|E
25|$|If {{a problem}} X is in C and hard for C, then X {{is said to}} be {{complete}} for C. This means that X is the hardest problem in C. (Since many problems could be equally hard, one might say that X is one of the hardest problems in C.) Thus the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, {{in the sense that they}} are <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>most</b> likely not to be in P. Because the problem P=NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, Π2, to another problem, Π1, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for Π1. This is because a polynomial-time solution to Π1 would yield a polynomial-time solution to Π2. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P=NP.|$|E

25|$|During the Early Jurassic, the ichthyosaurs still {{showed a}} large variety of species, ranging {{from one to}} ten metres in length. From this epoch, the {{original}} British discoveries were made, so that among ichthyosaurs, their names are <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>most</b> familiar to the general public. Genera include Eurhinosaurus, Ichthyosaurus, Leptonectes, Stenopterygius, and the large predator Temnodontosaurus, along with the basal parvipelvian Suevoleviathan, which was little changed from its Norian ancestors. The general morphological variability had been strongly reduced, however. Giant forms, suction feeders and durophagous species were absent. All of these animals were streamlined, dolphin-like forms, although the more basal animals were perhaps more elongated than the advanced and compact Stenopterygius and Ichthyosaurus. The latter belonged to a parvipelvian subgroup, the Thunnosauria. These were fully adapted to an efficient thunniform locomotion, propelling themselves {{with the end of}} the tail only, equipped with a vertical tail fin. Their front flippers had more than five fingers. Another parvipelvian branch were the Eurhinosauria like Leptonectes and Eurhinosaurus, which were specialised forms having a very elongated and pointy snout.|$|E
25|$|In 786 the Muslim caliph, Abd-er Rahman I, {{began the}} {{construction}} of the great mosque of Cordova, now a cathedral, and compelled many Christians {{to take part in the}} preparation of the site and foundations. The executions of the martyrs caused tension not only between Muslims and Christians, but within the Christian community. Abd er-Rahmán II at first ordered the arrest and detention of the clerical leadership of the local Christian community. As the civil disobedience seemed to subside, the clergy were released in November 851. When several months later there was a new wave of protests, the emir turned again to the Christian leaders as <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>most</b> capable of controlling the Christian community. Instead of imprisoning them, he ordered them to convene a council in Córdoba to review the matter and develop some strategy for dealing with the dissidents internally. He gave the bishops a choice: Christians could stop the public dissent or face harassment, loss of jobs, and economic hardship. Upon the death of Abd-er Rahman II in 852, his son and successor, Muhammad I removed all Christian officials from their palace appointments.|$|E

Highly paid players were seen as <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>most</b> affected by the disputed issues, rather than the union's membership as a whole.

2500|$|The {{northern}} pike {{is a relatively}} aggressive species, especially with regards to feeding. For example, when food sources are sparse, cannibalism develops, starting around five weeks in {{a small percentage of}} populations. This cannibalism occurs when the ratio of predator to prey is two to one. One can expect this because when food is scarce, Northern pike fight for survival, such as turning on smaller pike to feed; this is seen in other species such as tiger salamanders. Usually, pike tend to feed on smaller fish, such as the banded killifish. However, when pike exceed [...] long, they feed on larger fish. As one can probably assume, these pike are <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>most</b> likely to develop cannibalistic traits.|$|E
