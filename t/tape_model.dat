Generally, the critical state model {{is used to calculate}} the AC loss value of the HTS conductor with Finite Element Method (FEM). The mesh of the model have a large impact both on the convergence and the accuracy in calculation processes. In this paper, we investigate the effect of different meshes on the AC loss calculation of HTS conductors using a second generation <b>tape</b> <b>model.</b> Both triangular and quadrangle element with fix number of elements and predefined distribution type meshes have been used.

40|$|In this paper, the helix {{slow wave}} {{structure}} (SWS) of traveling wave tubes (TWT's) has been analyzed, Dielectric supporting rods of arbitrary cross section {{have been considered}} in this analysis. The inhomogeneous dielectric loading factor has been accounted for by modeling the discrete support {{with a number of}} continuous dielectric tubes of appropriate effective dielectric permittivity, The helix <b>tape</b> <b>model</b> has been used for the field analysis. Furthermore the thickness of the helix tape has been considered. A rigorous solution of the field equations, including the contribution of the space harmonics, was performed to evaluate the phase velocity and the interaction impedance up to millimeter-wave frequencies. The nonuniformity of radial propagation constant over the structure cross section has been also included. With respect to other approaches, a closed-form expression of the field constants has been obtained. A study to choose the optimum number of space harmonics and dielectric tubes {{to be used in the}} analysis, has shown how the results are more sensitive to the number of space harmonics than to the number of dielectric tubes, beyond a certain number of the latter. The validity of this theory has been proved by comparison between measurements and simulations for helix SWS with different dimensions, rod shapes and operating frequency band...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Extensive {{experimental}} {{measurements were}} carried out to test {{the accuracy of the}} parametric helix traveling-wave tube (TWT) code, CHRISTINE [1]. The model is one-dimensional, with beam electrons represented as rigid disks. Multifrequency inter-actions are supported and the RF circuit can be optionally repre-sented with cold-test data, a sheath helix model, or a recently im-plemented <b>tape</b> helix <b>model</b> [2]. Simulations using the <b>tape</b> helix <b>model</b> are shown to be in good agreement with experimental mea-surements of an L-band TWT over a broad (250 -MHz) frequency range. In the intermediate and saturated power regimes, the mod-eled and measured TWT gain versus frequency agree to better than 0. 4 dB, with deviations explained by strong reflections at the output window that are not accounted for in the code. Single-tone exper-imental and simulated drive curves agree to better than 1 dB in the small- and large-signal regimes; relative phase shift simula-tions agree to within experimental measurement accuracy in the small-signal regime and to within 75 % in the large-signal regime. Two-tone experimental and modeled data exhibit similarly good agreement, with CHRISTINE accurately predicting the effect of frequency-dependent gain variations on the TWT output response and third- and fifth-order intermodulation products.

40|$|Geckos can run rapidly {{on walls}} and ceilings, {{requiring}} high friction forces (on walls) and adhesion forces (on ceilings), with typical step intervals of ≈ 20 ms. The rapid switching between gecko foot attachment and detachment is analyzed theoretically {{based on a}} <b>tape</b> <b>model</b> that incorporates the adhesion and friction forces originating from the van der Waals forces between the submicron-sized spatulae and the substrate, which are controlled by the (macroscopic) actions of the gecko toes. The pulling force of a spatula along its shaft with an angle θ between 0 and 90 ° to the substrate, has a “normal adhesion force” contribution, produced at the spatula-substrate bifurcation zone, and a “lateral friction force” contribution from the part of spatula still {{in contact with the}} substrate. High net friction and adhesion forces on the whole gecko are obtained by rolling down and gripping the toes inward to realize small pulling angles θ between the large number of spatulae in contact with the substrate. To detach, the high adhesion/friction is rapidly reduced to a very low value by rolling the toes upward and backward, which, mediated by the lever function of the setal shaft, peels the spatulae off perpendicularly from the substrates. By these mechanisms, both the adhesion and friction forces of geckos can be changed over three orders of magnitude, allowing for the swift attachment and detachment during gecko motion. The results have obvious implications for the fabrication of dry adhesives and robotic systems inspired by the gecko's locomotion mechanism...|$|E
40|$|For future {{particle}} accelerators bending dipoles are considered with magnetic fields exceeding 20 T. This {{can only be}} achieved using high temperature superconductors (HTS). These exhibit different properties from classical low temperature superconductors and still require significant research and development {{before they can be}} applied in a practical accelerator magnet. In order to study HTS in detail, a five tesla demonstrator magnet named Feather-M 2 is designed and constructed. The magnet is based on ReBCO coated conductor, which is assembled into a 10 kA class Roebel cable. A new and optimized Aligned Block layout is used, which takes advantage of the anisotropy of the conductor. This is achieved by providing local alignment of the Roebel cable in the coil windings with the magnetic field lines. A new Network Model capable of analyzing transient electro-magnetic and thermal phenomena in coated conductor cables and coils is developed. This mode is necessary to solve critical issues in coated conductor accelerator magnets, such as thermal stability, quench propagation and field quality. The electrical part of the Network Model is validated using a series of benchmark simulation tests and measurements. The model is then used to calculate the dynamic field quality in coil structures. It is concluded that dynamic compensation of the field quality is needed. This can be achieved by a series of persistent current shim coils that are inserted inside the aperture, which is a novel concept introduced in this thesis. The thermal part of the Network Model is validated by comparing it to an earlier experimentally validated one-dimensional single <b>tape</b> <b>model.</b> Using this a quench is modeled in a section of Roebel cable and later in the full Feather-M 2 coil. Is it shown that the initialization of the quench consists of three phases: Thermal Drift, Pre-Quench and Quench. The Drift phase can be detected using temperature sensors and the Pre-Quench phase using an array of pick-up coils. These quench detection techniques, provided sufficient margin in maintained, could allow for safe operation of HTS coils up to very high current densities. An iterative layout optimization algorithm is implemented and used to study layouts at the magnetic field limit of Nb 3 Sn. It is shown that grading of the Nb 3 Sn is essential for reaching magnetic fields beyond 14 T with 20 % margin and that operation at 1. 9 K and improving the critical current density of the Nb 3 Sn conductor are highly recommended. Additionally, preliminary results are shown for layouts using HTS in the high magnetic field region of the coil in 20 T magnets...|$|E

40|$|To {{examine the}} effects of {{combinations}} of vicarious verbal reinforcements upon children's moral judgments, six classes of first graders were given a Piaget-type dilemma problem under one of three combinations of vicarious verbal reinforcements. Each duenlma problem consisted of a pair of two stories; one story involved good intention and large negative consequence, and the other bad intention and small negative consequence. A total 50 problems, 10 for the operant task, 20 for the acquisition task of the subjects, and 20 for the acquisition task of the model, were constructed. Vicarious reinforcements were given by the use of <b>taped</b> <b>models</b> in which the model's intentional judgments gradully increased through 20 trials. In the Right-Wrong (RW) <b>modeled</b> <b>tape</b> the experimenter reinforced the model's intentional judgment by saying "Yes" (right) with the reason of his judgment, and reinforced his consequential judgment by saying "No" (wrong) with the correction of his answer. In the Right-Nothing (RN) <b>modeled</b> <b>tape</b> the experimenter reinforced only the model's intentional judgment by saying "Yes" (right) with the reason of his judgment. In the Nothing-Wrong (NW) <b>modeled</b> <b>tape</b> the experimenter reinforced only the model's consequential judgment by saying "No" with the correction of his answer. The experiment was performed in every classroom. The moral judgment stories by a taperecorder were presented with their pictures which drew the parts of intention and consequence.
