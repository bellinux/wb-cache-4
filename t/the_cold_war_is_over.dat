Two weeks later, after the Russian parliament authorized {{the use of military force}} in Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered military exercises along Russia's border with Ukraine, Paul began taking a different tone. He wrote: [...] "Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is a gross violation of that nation's sovereignty and an affront to the international community... Putin must be punished for violating the Budapest Memorandum, and Russia must learn that the U.S. will isolate it if it insists on acting like a rogue nation." [...] He said that the United States and European allies could retaliate against Russia's military aggression without any need for military action. He urged that the United States impose economic sanctions on Russia and resume an effort to build ]. He also called for the United States to take steps as a counterweight to Russia's strategic influence on Europe's oil and gas supply, such as lifting restrictions on new exploration and drilling for fossil fuels in the United States along with immediate approval of the controversial Keystone Pipeline, which he said would allow the United States to ship more oil and gas to Europe if Russia attempts to cut off its own supply to Europe.|$|E

40|$|The {{last decade}} of this {{millennium}} is experiencing a revolution in undersea technologies relevant to naval military applications.

Nonetheless, {{sporadic}} efforts to redistribute land continued: Ethiopia in 1975, Zimbabwe in 1980 and a renewed commitment to land reform in the Philippines in 1988. These reforms stemmed from shifts in the domestic {{balance of power between}} landowners and landless workers and peasants, which were quite independent of donor policies. In the 1990 s, decollectivisation and privatisation in the former socialist economies have provided a new dimension to land reform; so too has majority rule in South Africa, where the racially-skewed ownership of land is under challenge and where market-based measures to achieve land redistribution in favour of blacks are being tried.

40|$|For fifty years, the United States was {{involved}} in a nuclear arms race of immense proportions.

Rather than a piece of original research, this paper is a summary of personal views and reflections about the current status of the U. S. -Japan economic relationship. The purpose is to stimulate discussion at our seminar meeting about the relationship, somewhat in continuation of what transpired at the seminar's Washington meeting concerning Marcus Noland's paper. If there is a theme or conclusion to the following pages, it is that economists need to be less purely academic in their approach to bilateral issues. Important problems do exist in the bilateral relationship; they are not all necessarily true economic problems, but neither are they simply "political" issues which economists tend to view with disdain. Dealing with these problems obviously requires tact and diplomacy, but they can be ignored only at the peril of seriously damaging the overall economic and strategic relationship. Especially now that <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>over,</b> and economic aspects of the U.

40|$|In {{studying}} {{the history of}} the ethics of war, the just war tradition may be interpreted as a historically evolving body of tenets about just war principles. (See the appendix for an introduction to these principles.) Instead of a single just war theory, there have been many just war theories—for example, those of Augustine, Aquinas, Vitoria, and Grotius—theories that have various commonalities and differences. A comprehensive history of the evolving just war tradition should feature a thorough study of how these just war theories were rethought. For example, in his landmark work Just and Unjust Wars, written during the Cold War, Michael Walzer exclaimed: “Nuclear weapons explode the theory of just war. ” 1 In his rethinking of the just war tradition in light of the superpower practice of nuclear deterrence, he contributed his influential conception of supreme emergency exceptions. Now that <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>is</b> <b>over,</b> the authors of the articles in this book are primarily concerned with the question of how the just war tradition—which is understood somewhat differently by the different authors—should be rethought today. Echoing Walzer’s exclamation, among the particular post–Cold War questions that can be raised are these: Is just war theory exploded by terrorism? Is it annihilated by genocide? In their various rethinkings of the just war tradition, our authors state their own particular post–Cold War questions, and answer them from their diverse viewpoints [...] ...|$|E

Now that <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>is</b> <b>over,</b> the United States Government is faced with a declining budget and smaller military force. Even with a reduced budget, the Government must continue to maintain and operate military facilities around the world.

With the implementation of the Federal Acquisition Reform Act of 1996, the Government is now using a two phase design build process that allows for the pre-qualification of contractors prior to submittal proposal and contract award. Southern Division (SOUTHDIV), Naval Facilities Engineering Command, located in Charleston, South Carolina has taken the two phase design build process one step further.
