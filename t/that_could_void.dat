500|$|Hess {{and team}} {{president}} Gutman {{agreed on a}} top candidate as new coach — Patriots coach Bill Parcells, who had won two Super Bowls with the Giants {{and was in the}} process of taking the Patriots there as well. [...] Parcells believed <b>that</b> he <b>could</b> <b>void</b> his contract and seek a position elsewhere; New England owner Robert Kraft believed the Patriots would be entitled to compensation. NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue ruled in the Patriots' favor, and New England demanded the Jets give them the first pick overall in the upcoming draft. The Jets responded by hiring Parcells disciple Bill Belichick as head coach; Parcells was to serve as a [...] "consultant" [...] in 1997 and head coach beginning in 1998. The Patriots were unimpressed by what they saw as a subterfuge, and Tagliabue mediated the matter. He set Parcells free from the Patriots; the Jets gave the Patriots four draft picks, including their first round pick in 1999. The Jets put an end to Belichick's six-day reign (he remained as assistant head coach and as defensive coordinator) and hired Parcells as head coach.|$|R
5|$|In Europe, formal futures markets {{appeared}} in the Dutch Republic during the 17th century. Among the most notable centered on the tulip market, {{at the height of}} Tulipmania. At the peak of tulip mania, in February 1637, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsworker. Research is difficult because of the limited economic data from the 1630s—much of which come from biased and very speculative sources. Some modern economists have proposed rational explanations, rather than a speculative mania, for the rise and fall in prices. For example, other flowers, such as the hyacinth, also had high initial prices {{at the time of their}} introduction, which immediately fell. The high asset prices may also have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree <b>that</b> contracts <b>could</b> be <b>voided</b> for a small cost—thus lowering the risk to buyers.|$|R

While vintage DJs such as Keb Darge and Paul Weller play out the reissues and originals of roots rock ‘n’ roll, R&B, northern soul and jump blues... Cass felt that there weren’t any new or current bands playing or writing these genres of music.

50|$|Historically, {{there has}} been much dispute over whether {{such a thing as a}} vacuum can exist. Ancient Greek {{philosophers}} debated the existence of a vacuum, or void, in the context of atomism, which posited void and atom as the fundamental explanatory elements of physics. Following Plato, even the abstract concept of a featureless void faced considerable skepticism: it could not be apprehended by the senses, it could not, itself, provide additional explanatory power beyond the physical volume with which it was commensurate and, by definition, it was quite literally nothing at all, which cannot rightly be said to exist. Aristotle believed <b>that</b> no <b>void</b> <b>could</b> occur naturally, because the denser surrounding material continuum would immediately fill any incipient rarity that might give rise to a void.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{assessed}} {{the impact of}} transobturator tape (TOT) treatment on overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with a particular focus on nocturia in patients with mixed urinary incontinence (MUI). Materials and Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, the medical records of 237 women who underwent TOT surgery {{for the treatment of}} MUI were reviewed. Of these, 86 patients (36. 4 %) had preoperative nocturia. Patients with neurological diseases or sleep disorders <b>that</b> <b>could</b> affect the <b>voiding</b> pattern were excluded. Patients who were being treated with anticholinergics and antidiuretic hormones were also excluded, which left 70 subjects eligible for analysis. Pre- and postoperative evaluations consisted of a physical examination, 3 -day frequency-volume chart, and health-related quality of life questionnaires (King’s health questionnaire, overactive bladder symptom score, and OAB-questionnaire). Results: TOT treatment resulted in an overall significant improvement in OAB symp-toms including nocturia.

40|$|Purpose: The {{pathogenesis}} {{of lower}} urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is uncertain. We investigated the potential role of inflammation {{in the development}} of LUTS, with the use of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) as an inflammatory marker, in a pop-ulation-based study of aging men in Korea. Materials and Methods: Our study used a multistage stratified design to recruit a ran-dom sample of 1, 510 men aged 45 years or older in Chuncheon, Korea, in 2003. Men with urologic or neurologic diseases <b>that</b> <b>could</b> cause <b>voiding</b> dysfunction were excluded. Also, men with medical conditions <b>that</b> <b>could</b> affect inflammation, such as infection or the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, were excluded. LUTS were defined according to the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Various potential confounding factors were included in the analyses. Results: A total of 330 subjects were included in the final analyses. There were 155 (47. 0 %) with an IPSS＜ 8 and 175 (53 %) with an IPSS≥ 8. The mean age of all subjects was 69. 2 ± 8. 4 years. The mean hsCRP level of all subjects was 2. 30 ± 3. 27 (median, 1. 19) mg/l. The hsCRP levels in subjects with an IPSS≥ 8 differed significantly from those in subjects with an IPSS＜ 8. Also, IPSS, storage symptom, voiding symptom, and qual-ity of life (QoL) scores increased as hsCRP levels increased, respectively. The hsCRP level remained an independent risk factor of LUTS (IPSS≥ 8, storage symptom score≥ 4, incomplete voiding, intermittency, and QoL) after adjustment for variable possible confounding factors. Conclusions: Our results suggest that inflammatory processes may {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of LUTS and that hsCRP levels may indicate the severity of LUTS in aging men...|$|R

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to detect small voids in solid insulators due to the large statistical time lag. The use of pulsed x-ray irradiation is a practical method to detect small defects at lower electrical stress so that potentially harmful effects of high voltage testing can be minimized.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of sand {{was found to}} be governed by its chemical properties rather than its physical properties. Hence, it is important to determine the geochemistry properties of sand besides its physical properties. The thermal applied on the bentonite and kaolin is one of the important external elements for changing soil mechanical characteristics based on mineralogy and stress-strain relationship. It is for considering of mineralogy and mechanical properties of bentonite and kaolin to development a better construction material. To evaluation of bentonite clay and kaolin behavior when subjected to the thermal, several laboratory tests have been conducted to analysis of bentonite characteristics. This project aimed on determining the strength of sand, mixed with 0. 25 %, 0. 5 %, 1 % and 2 % of bentonite and kaolin with and without thermal added the bentonite and Kaolin for 300 'C for one hour. Bentonite and kaolin, in powdered forms, was mix with sand and compacted at optimum moisture content. The strength of the compacted samples was determined from direct shear test. It was observed that the material of bentonite and kaolin increased the cohesion of sand. The result shows that 1 % bentonite 300 'C gives higher shear strength of sand. This shows that the bentonite can be used to increase the strength soil than kaolin. This due to the fine nature of the materials <b>that</b> <b>could</b> fill the <b>voids</b> in the mixture but also contribute to decrease in friction angles...|$|R

40|$|Coal {{is one of}} the world’s most {{important}} sources of energy, fuelling almost 40 % of electricity worldwide. The burning of coal produced coal ash that mostly consists of Fly Ash and Bottom Ash. Bottom Ash (normally recognized as coal combustion residues from pulverized fuel power stations) has been categorized as solid garbage. However, the utilization of Bottom Ash in construction-related applications has received some attention within the last decade. This project aimed at determining the strength and compressibility of Kaolin, mixed with 25 %, 50 % and 60 % of bottom ash. Kaolin, in powdered forms, was mixed with Bottom Ash and compacted at optimum moisture content. The strength and compressibility of the compacted samples were determined from direct shear test, unconsolidated undrained triaxial tests, and one-dimensional consolidation test, besides the California Bearing Ratio and permeability tests. It was observed that the granular nature of Bottom Ash increased the friction angle of Kaolin, increased the permeability and expedite the consolidation rate. However, the addition of 25 % Bottom Ash gives the highest shear strength of Kaolin while the addition of 60 % Bottom Ash gives the highest permeability and coefficient of consolidation. This results show that Bottom Ash can be used to increase the strength of soil, in particular the soft soil and also could expedite the consolidation of the soil. This is due to the granular nature of the materials <b>that</b> <b>could</b> increase the <b>voids</b> in the mixtures and also contribute to increase in friction angles...|$|R

40|$|Parenting post re-settlement in a {{new country}} is {{challenging}} for many refugee families (Boehlein, et. al., 1995). They {{have to cope with}} a number of potential stressors (NCTSN, 2012) which can potentially impact their ability to parent effectively, increasing the likelihood that their children develop child behavioural and emotional problems (Neiderhiser, Reiss & Hetherington et. al., 1999). Currently Australia provides no parenting assistance or information for refugee parents about how to effectively parent in Australian communities. The Positive Parenting Program (Triple P) is a parenting program <b>that</b> <b>could</b> fill this <b>void</b> to offer strategies to increase parent self-efficacy and target problematic child conduct (Sanders, Kirby & Tellegen, 2013). The aim of the current study is to use a mixed-method design to investigate parenting experiences post resettlement, and whether a sub-set of Triple P strategies is perceived by the parents as acceptable and useful. Overall the sample of nine parents reported the Triple P strategies for promoting competency and development were highly acceptable and useful, they were highly likely to and currently engaged in them. In comparison the Triple P strategies for managing misbehaviour were rated significantly more poorly in acceptability and useability, parents reported they were unlikely to engage in the strategies. These quantitative finding are consistent with the qualitative data, where parents reported physical punishment was previously their main disciplinarian strategy preresettlement, and the only real effective method of discipline. An additional six themes extracted from the data describe a strong patriarchal culture and reliance on physical strength. Child protective policies and Centrelink {{have a significant impact on}} the family power hierarchy and ability for parents to discipline their children effectively. These finding have implications for how Triple P is presented and implemented with this group of parents, where additional educational components may be needed to address prevalent inaccurate beliefs that may undermine the acceptance of other, non-violent disciplinary techniques...|$|R
5|$|This decree allowed {{someone who}} {{purchased}} {{a contract to}} void the contract with a payment of only 3.5 percent of the contract price (or about 1/30 the contract).

40|$|Polymer matrix {{composites}} {{are used}} extensively for their exceptional mechanical properties. The effect of voids {{on the energy}} release rate of interface crack has been studied before; however none of the studies investigated the effect of voids on the kinking of a crack from the interface into the adhesive film. In the following report, a parametric study is conducted to understand {{the effect of the}} void size, the void shape and the void location on the kinking of an interface crack in single lap joint. An interface crack can originate from the maximum shear stress or the maximum normal stress that occurs at the interface between the adherend and the adhesive. A void is placed ahead of the crack tip at various distances in the Finite elements model to determine the critical distance. After determining the critical distance, the effect of the void radius and the void shape are examined on the crack kinking process. The interface crack is assumed to propagate a distance of 0. 1 mm at different angles ranging from 0 to 90 degrees with an increment of 10 degrees. The energy release rate is calculated by the revised virtual crack closure technique (RVCCT). The total energy release rate is calculated by adding Mode I and Mode II from the revised virtual crack closure technique (RVCCT) and justified by the J- integral method. Since the crack is an interface crack, the crack is expected to have a mixed mode behavior. A force boundary condition is applied. As the force increases, Mode I and Mode II increase. Moreover, it is evident from the results obtained <b>that</b> a <b>void</b> <b>could</b> lead an interface crack to kink into the adhesive, if the distance between the void and crack tip is significantly small to cause an interaction between the crack tip and the void...|$|R

The objective {{of the program is}} to develop multi-dimensional computer codes which can be used for the analysis of subassembly voiding incoherence under postulated accident conditions in the LMFBR. This work is expected to contribute to LMFBR safety analysis in two ways. First, it will provide a capability for obtaining more dependable information concerning the effects of subassembly voiding incoherence in LMFBR's of current design. Second, it will provide the calculational tools needed to develop new designs with features <b>that</b> <b>could</b> inhibit radial <b>void</b> growth and thus, enhance the reactor safety. Two codes are being developed in parallel. The first will use a two fluid (6 equation) model which is more difficult to develop but has the potential for providing a code with the utmost in flexibility and physical consistency for use in the long term. The other will use a "mixture" (< 6 equation) model which is less general but may be more amenable to interpretation and use of experimental data and therefore, easier to develop for use in the near term. To assure that the models developed are not design dependent, geometries and transient conditions typical of both foreign and U. S. designs are being considered. In addition to the code development, a study is being conducted which is aimed at obtaining a basic understanding of flow oscillations observed in low power, low flow sodium boiling experiments conducted at ORNL using the THORS test facility. This study includes water tests to simulate low power low flow sodium boiling flow oscillations and development of an analytical model to predict the oscillations. During FY 1979 an effort has also been made to coordinate this program with other related DOE sponsored programs and activities concerned with sodium boiling R&D. The objectives of this effort are: (1) to assure maximum use is made of data and information available from related programs and (2) to facilitate eventual acquisition and use of the codes being developed by the appropriate DOE contractors and laboratories.
