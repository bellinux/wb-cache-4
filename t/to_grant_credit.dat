The reforms also included the ability <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>credit,</b> as well as act as a reserve. The plan also focused on creating the Colombian Corporation of Credit, Development, and Savings. This would be divided into three different sectors: The Institute of Credit, Institute of Development, and the Institute of Saving. The Institute of Credit was proposed to afford loans to industrial and agricultural firms.

50|$|For {{more than}} three decades, this {{monetary}} regime successfully faced many shocks. However, {{the extent of the}} external debt crisis unleashed in 1981, the adjustments necessary to bring an unbalanced economy back into equilibrium, fiscal pressures, unbridled inflation and, above all, the need to reorder the whole economy to return to a more appropriate growth path, made yet more drastic changes necessary. To this end, in May 1992, the government issued the Law of Monetary Regime and State Bank, whereby the Central Bank of Ecuador was able to intervene in the financial system through open market operations. With this powerful instrument of policy, it has been possible to control inflation, unprecedented in the monetary history of Ecuador. Additionally, the need for new commitments for public sector austerity forced to violate the power <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>credit</b> to the Treasury. Finally, {{in order to protect the}} interests of customers of the banking system, the Central Bank of Ecuador was authorized to operate as a lender of last resort, within strict financial parameters.

30|$|The {{association}} between information-sharing bureaus and financial access {{can be seen}} from the view of adverse selection (from lenders) on the one hand and the perspective of moral hazard (from borrowers) on the other. Information-sharing agencies provide lenders of financial institutions with borrower information and credit histories that enable the reduction of substantial interest rates, which were the previous consequence of adverse selection on the part of financial institutions. When borrowers are <b>granted</b> <b>credit,</b> they automatically become liable to moral hazard, because their economic activities related <b>to</b> <b>granted</b> <b>credit</b> could be concealed in order to reduce compliance with their financial obligations towards the bank or lender. The responsibility therefore falls on the credit bureaus to discipline borrowers on the severe consequences of not complying with their periodic financial obligations. It is within this framework that information-sharing bureaus reduce moral hazard in borrowers, essentially by educating them on the perils of debt defaults and resorting to the informal financial sector as a sustainable alternative to the formal banking sector.|$|R
