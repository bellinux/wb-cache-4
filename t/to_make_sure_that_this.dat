Mandy Musgrave also auditioned {{for the role}} of Spencer, but Lynch liked her {{chemistry}} with Christian, so he paired the two up with Musgrave as Ashley. The pilot was first shot in October 2004 and directed by Rose Troche, but after the series was picked up by The N in January 2005, Lynch decided to recast many of the characters.

500|$|Soon, Shakira {{began work}} on her next studio album, titled She Wolf, which was, among other places, {{recorded}} at the Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shakira said that specifically chose the studio after she learned that it had previously been used for recording sessions by artists like Bob Marley, The Cure, and AC/DC, of whom she is a fan. Unlike most of her previous projects, which are predominantly composed of Latin and pop rock styles, She Wolf is an electropop album with world music influences. When asked why the album had electronic influences, Shakira responded, [...] "I felt very curious and intrigued about the electro-pop world and everything it has to offer. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> album was very bassy and that the kicks hit really hard, and I wanted {{to concentrate on the}} beat. But my music, to a certain extent, is very complex– because I always try to experiment with sounds {{from other parts of the}} world." [...] Explaining the meaning behind the title, Shakira said that [...] "'She Wolf' is the woman of our time. The woman who knows what she wants and is free of prejudice and preconceived notions. She defends her deepest desires with teeth and claws like a wild animal".|$|E

In 1982 Rustin adopted Naegle, 30 years old at the time, in order to legalize their union. Naegle explains, We actually had to go through a process as if Bayard was adopting a small child. My biological mother had to sign a legal paper, a paper disowning me. They had to send a social worker to our home.

[...] "It’s just gonna be a different album, but of course expressing the love that I feel now and the struggles and different situations that I’ve gone through in the past,...

He was a churchwarden, an {{overseer}} of the parish, and an important man locally. It is said that one night, he and two friends witnessed grave robbers at a local graveyard, and they vowed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would not happen to them. Trigg stated in his will that his body should be committed for a minimum of 30 years to [...] "the West end of my Hovel to be decently laid there upon a floor erected by my Executor, upon the purlin for the same purpose, nothing doubting but that at the general Resurrection, I shall receive the same again by the mighty power of God." [...] According to Gentleman's Magazine of 5 Feb 1751, Trigg's will stated that he supposed that he would return to life after 30 years and then his estate would revert to him, and that he ordered that the barn be locked with the key inside his coffin so that he could let himself out. Shortly before he died, Trigg had negotiated with the parish authorities to rent his barn as the town's workhouse.|$|E
2500|$|On March 7, 2007, Rosselló {{stated that}} he was no longer {{interested}} in the Senate Presidency and then focused his attention in preventing Resident Commissioner Luis Fortuño from winning the March 2008 gubernatorial primary, and allowed his name to be placed in nomination for the party's gubernatorial primary. McClintock and four other senators won in San Juan Superior Court a suit to nullify the sanctions and expulsions that the party leadership has levied against them. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court confirmed the lower court decision by a 5-to-1 vote. As a result, McClintock and his supporters were recognized as NPP members and free to run under the party banner. [...] Shortly after the primary polls closed on March 9, 2008, Pedro Rosselló conceded the victory to Luis Fortuño after a large margin of votes in favor of his opponent in the NPP party primaries for the presidency of the party and gubernatorial nomination. Rosselló admitted defeat even before the votes were completely tallied claiming Fortuño as the next candidate of the PNP party. In Rosselló's conceding speech he said [...] "Luis Fortuño has been selected by the people to be the new president of this party and the candidate for governor. I always say the people speak and I obey, Fortuño here is your party and here is your office (signaling the party's official headquarters). Now it's up to you, the loyal members of this party, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> new leadership works for statehood for Puerto Rico". After this conceding speech it was rumored and even announced at Fortuño's headquarters that the former Governor would arrive there along with his loyal supporter and mayor of the capital city of San Juan, Jorge Santini, but after Fortuño's followers waited for hours to see their leaders united neither Rosselló or Santini arrived. After the primary was over it was heavily rumored by many that Rosselló would not be campaigning for Fortuño and that he'd resign as senator {{to go back to his}} home in Virginia. On March 10, 2008, Rosselló sent the media a written statement regarding his future in which he confirmed he will be retiring from active politics and will not be campaigning for any candidate, however he would finish his term as senator for the Arecibo District, which he did.|$|E
