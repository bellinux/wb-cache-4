2500|$|After <b>the</b> war, <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> {{was faced}} with new opportunities. As the war greatly {{expanded}} <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> now had extra space. Thus, <b>the</b> Hingham <b>yard</b> was closed, and <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> diversified its interests. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> constructed a [...] blast furnace, a wind tunnel, draglines, and steel for an aqueduct of the Boston's Metropolitan District Commission, a transformer for Boston Edison, among other things. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> {{was faced with}} inflation, increasing material costs, and demands for higher wages.|$|R
2500|$|... 1963 {{brought an}} {{end of an era}} to <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> as Bethlehem put <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> up for sale. Fifty years of Bethlehem ownership, which began when <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> was near {{financial}} ruin, came to an end as <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> was one of <b>the</b> most established <b>yards</b> in <b>the</b> world.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>yard</b> is {{surrounded}} by old residential neighborhoods and some abandoned industrial facilities. To the north of <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> beneath <b>the</b> tracks, runs Hertel Avenue. An abandoned portion of <b>the</b> north <b>yard</b> is now an automobile junk yard; Austin Street runs under the center of <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> Most of <b>the</b> trackbed in <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> has been ripped up.|$|R
5|$|In 1971, {{the area}} bounded by Pershing Road, Ashland, Halsted, and 47th Street became The Stockyards Industrial Park. The {{neighborhood}} {{to the west}} and south of the industrial park is still known as Back of <b>the</b> <b>Yards,</b> and is still home to a thriving immigrant population.|$|E
5|$|Dainty {{was ordered}} on 2 February 1931 under the 1930 Naval Estimates and was laid down at <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> of the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Govan, Scotstoun on 20 April 1931. She was {{launched}} on 3 May 1932 and completed on 22 December 1932, {{at a total}} cost of £229,378, excluding equipment supplied by the Admiralty, such as weapons, ammunition and wireless equipment.|$|E
5|$|Diana {{was ordered}} under the 1930 Naval Estimates on 2 February 1931 from <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> of Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company, Hebburn-on-Tyne. She was laid down on 12 June 1931, {{launched}} on 16 June 1932 and finally commissioned into the Navy on 21 December 1932. She cost {{a total of}} £229,502, excluding the weapons and the communications equipment which were supplied by the Admiralty.|$|E
50|$|Military {{chain of}} command was {{strictly}} observed. During <b>the</b> <b>yard's</b> construction of Robert Fulton's steam frigate, , launched in 1815, the year of Fulton's death, <b>the</b> Navy <b>Yard's</b> chief officers were listed as: Captain Commandant, Master Commandant, Lieutenant of <b>the</b> <b>Yard,</b> Master of <b>the</b> <b>Yard,</b> Surgeon of <b>the</b> <b>Yard</b> & Marine Barracks, Purser of <b>the</b> Navy <b>Yard,</b> Naval Storekeeper, Naval Constructor, and a major commanding the Marine Corps detachment.|$|R
25|$|In 1964, <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> was {{purchased}} by General Dynamics Corporation. J. William Jones, President of the company, stated that <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> {{was purchased}} {{in order to provide}} its Electric Boat division with increased flexibility. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> was purchased for $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars), and Electric Boat managed <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> until its reorganization. Immediately, <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> was closed by Bethlehem Steel on 1 January 1964, and it was announced that thirteen hundred of <b>the</b> <b>yard's</b> employees would be retired or pensioned off immediately or within the next two years, leaving five hundred workers left. General Dynamics immediately invested $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) into various facilities in <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> improving it in many ways.|$|R
40|$|Since the New Globe Theatre {{opened in}} 1996, {{they have used}} <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> as an acting area or entrances. Even though the {{authenticity}} of using <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> is disputable, nobody denies that <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> must be a very effective tool for performing Shakespeare at the Globe Theatre. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> {{is an essential part}} of traditional Korean theatre, called “talchum (mask dance) ” or “talnori (mask play). ” <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> is its stage as well as the auditorium. Therefore, the players are surrounded by the audience, and the players can, and often do interact with the audience, speaking to the audience, or treating them as players, or acting as if they were some of the audience. The theatrical style of using <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> has much influenced the modern theatre of Korea. And many Korean directors including Oh Tae-suk, Yang Jung-ung, Sohn Jin-chaek, Park Sung-hwan, and myself, have applied <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> techniques to their Shakespearean productions. Korean Shakespearean productions, which use <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> actively, can be more evidence that <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> must be an effective tool for Shakespeare, not only at the Globe Theatre but also at any kind of theatres of today. No one knows whether Shakespeare actually used <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> or not. But the fact that many Shakespearean productions have used <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> successfully, implies that Shakespeare's texts themselves have enough room for <b>the</b> <b>yard...</b>|$|R
5|$|From the Civil War {{until the}} 1920s and peaking in 1924, more meat was {{processed}} in Chicago {{than in any}} other place in the world. Construction began in June 1865 with an opening on Christmas Day in 1865. <b>The</b> <b>Yards</b> closed at midnight on Friday, July 30, 1971, after several decades of decline during the decentralization of the meatpacking industry. The Union Stock Yard Gate was designated a Chicago Landmark on February 24, 1972, and a National Historic Landmark on May 29, 1981.|$|E
5|$|On October 28, 1978, Delaney {{carried the}} ball 28 times and gained 299 yards for Northwestern State against Nicholls State University with 263 of <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> {{coming in the}} game's second half. Delaney's rushing stats {{in the second half}} of the game are an NCAA record. In the same game, he scored four touchdowns, one of which was on a 90-yard run, as he led his team to a 28–18 victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosperity}} of the stockyards was due to both the concentration of railroads {{and the evolution of}} refrigerated railroad cars. Its decline was due to further advances in post-World War II transportation and distribution. Direct sales of livestock from breeders to packers, facilitated by advancement in interstate trucking, made it cheaper to slaughter animals where they were raised and excluded the intermediary stockyards. At first, the major meatpacking companies resisted change, but Swift and Armour both surrendered and vacated their plants in <b>the</b> <b>Yards</b> in the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>yard</b> {{is a key}} node on the BeltLine trail, whose {{northeast}} section terminates across Decatur Street/DeKalb Avenue {{from the}} west end of <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> and whose southeast section terminates at the east end of <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> and poses as issue as to how to connect the two sections of the trail across <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>yard</b> {{was formed}} by cutting a terrace into the hillside, with the {{excavated}} fill being dumped {{on the opposite side}} of <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> Further ground was levelled in the hillside above <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> on which houses were built. Over time, further ground was filled in on which to extend <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> and tracks.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>yard</b> {{continued}} to repair and build ships, {{particularly for the}} East India Company, throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> recovered under <b>the</b> management and later ownership of the Perry family. When the Navy again surveyed <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> in 1742, <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> had <b>the</b> greatest capacity on the Thames. In 1784 when Francis Holman painted it, it {{was said to be}} <b>the</b> biggest private <b>yard</b> in <b>the</b> world. It was at this time that the Perrys began construction of the large Brunswick Dock to the east of <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> opened in 1790.|$|R
5|$|The town {{continued}} to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment. During the next decades, <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square. In 1797, the manufacture of glass began.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} lower {{fittings}} of the rigging survives, a 1514 inventory {{and the only}} known contemporary depiction of the ship from the Anthony Roll {{have been used to}} determine how the propulsion system of the Mary Rose was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the foremast and mainmast had two and three square sails respectively; the mizzen mast had a lateen sail and a small square sail and the bonaventure mizzen had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the bowsprit flew a small square spritsail. According to the Anthony Roll illustration (see top of this section), <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> (the spars from which the sails were set) on the foremast and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.|$|E
5|$|Duchess {{was ordered}} on 2 February 1931 under the 1930 Naval Estimates and was laid down at <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> of the Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company, Jarrow on 12 June 1931. She was {{launched}} on 19 July 1932 and commissioned on 24 January 1933, {{at a total}} cost of £229,367, excluding equipment supplied by the Admiralty, such as weapons, ammunition and wireless equipment. The ship was initially assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean and made a brief deployment to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea in September–November 1933. Upon her return, her superheaters were repaired at Malta between 18 December and 6 January 1934. She was given a refit at Chatham Dockyard from 3 September to 23 October to prepare the ship for service on the China Station.|$|E
50|$|Another symbol {{found in}} “Everyday Use” is <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> plays an {{important}} role in the story, and is described as “an extended living room”. Mama and Maggie have both tidied up <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> in preparation of Dee’s visit, and sit out in <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> for hours, even after Dee’s departure. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> seems to be a place to think for Mama, where she can imagine herself being someone better than she actually is, but also remember just how much she has done for her family.|$|R
5000|$|In a lane off Moor Road to {{the south}} of <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> was <b>the</b> 'power house', along with <b>the</b> <b>Yard</b> Master's and Inspectors Offices and <b>the</b> <b>Yard</b> Master's House. At the time of opening the points within <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> {{controlled}} by [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] boxes, were controlled by electro-pneumatic power, this being extended to control points on the main line and signals. The compressed air was supplied from the 'power house' through a network of pipes running throughout <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> hauling parrel, [...] whose {{function}} is to hold <b>the</b> junk sail <b>yard</b> close to <b>the</b> mast. It runs from <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> around <b>the</b> mast, and then down to <b>the</b> deck. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> hauling parrel will control the lateral movement of the higher battens along the mast.|$|R
5|$|Lethbridge is {{near the}} Lethbridge Airport and the CPR rail yards in Kipp, Alberta. The airport {{provides}} commercial flights to Calgary and Edmonton, as well as private and charter flights elsewhere. The airport provides customs services for flights arriving from the United States. The rail yards were moved to Kipp, {{just west of the}} city, from downtown Lethbridge in 1983. <b>The</b> <b>yards</b> were planned for redevelopment with a mix of multi-family residential, commercial and light industrial land uses. The Park Place Mall is now located on the portion of the former rail yards north of 1Avenue South between Scenic Drive to the west and Stafford Drive to the east.|$|E
5|$|Not {{much had}} {{changed by the}} 1960s. The day began with a waking bell at 6:45am. After a {{prisoner}} count, they moved into the yard until 7:30, when they collected breakfast {{and headed back to}} their cells. The 8:00 bell signaled a parade, and then the start of work, which lasted until 11:15. They ate a meal, locked in their cells until 12:20pm, followed by some time in <b>the</b> <b>yards.</b> At 1:00 there was another parade, and another session of work which lasted to 4:15. Another meal was collected, and prisoners were locked away in their cells overnight. The lights stayed on until 9:30pm. On the weekends the routine featured no work, and included a film played for the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Rymkus {{was born}} in Royalton, Illinois, {{the son of a}} Lithuanian {{immigrant}} coal miner who owned a small grocery store. After his father was shot and killed outside the grocery store, Rymkus and his family moved to the Back of <b>the</b> <b>Yards</b> neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. With family finances tight, he took a number of odd jobs, including working as a laborer and delivering newspapers and groceries. At the suggestion of a friend, Rymkus attended Tilden Tech, now known as Tilden High School, and began to display talent as a lineman on the school's football team. He blocked a kick and scored a touchdown in a game at Chicago's Soldier Field in 1936 against rival Austin High, a play he later said was the most memorable of his high school career. Rymkus won seven letters at Tilden playing on the football, track and wrestling teams. As a senior, he defeated Rudy Mucha to win the Chicago prep-school wrestling title.|$|E
2500|$|After <b>the</b> war, <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> {{found itself}} faced with {{changing}} realities, and increasingly relied on merchant marine ships, including , the first chemical transport {{ship in the}} United States. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> also built passenger vessels, including , [...] and [...] The last ships built at <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> were <b>the</b> 2nd Lieutenant John P. Bobo Class of Maritime Prepositioning ships. With the building of , <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> closed for good.|$|R
50|$|Initially, <b>the</b> transom and <b>yard</b> are set so {{that the}} two are joined at their {{respective}} 45° settings. The instrument is held so that <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> is horizontal (<b>the</b> navigator can view the horizon along <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> to assist in this). The socket is loosened {{so that the}} transom is moved vertically until {{the shadow of the}} vane is cast at <b>the</b> <b>yard's</b> 90° setting. If the movement of just the transom can accomplish this, the altitude is given by the transom's graduations. If the sun is too high for this, <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> horizontal opening in the socket is loosened and <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> is moved to allow the shadow to land on the 90° mark. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> then yields <b>the</b> altitude.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Recreation <b>Yard</b> was <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> used by inmates of Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary between 1934 and 1963. It {{is located}} {{opposite}} the Dining Hall {{south of the}} end of D-Block on a raised level surrounded by a high wall and fence above it. Guard Tower #3 lay just to the west of <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> <b>The</b> gun gallery was situated in <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> mounted on one of the dining hall's exterior walls. <b>The</b> recreation <b>yard</b> faced <b>the</b> mainland.|$|R
5|$|Inmates were {{permitted}} {{out into the}} yard on Saturdays and Sundays and on holidays for a maximum of 5 hours. Inmates who worked seven days a week in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays. Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard access rights taken away from them on weekends. The prisoners of Alcatraz {{were permitted}} to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times and intellectual games such as chess. Because of the small size of the yard and the diamond at the end of it, a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded to cushion the impact of inmates overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Many of the inmates used weekends in <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> to converse with each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for a durable conversation.|$|E
25|$|Halyards (sometimes haulyards) {{are used}} to raise and lower <b>the</b> <b>yards.</b>|$|E
25|$|At the {{northeast}} {{side of the}} Main Arena are the livestock marshalling yards. Above <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> is a substantial formed concrete stand with a raked, open-air seating area. Between the concrete piers which support this structure are sets of sheeted metal gates opening from <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> onto the arena. At {{the back of the}} concrete stand is a small, detached, two-storey brick office building.|$|E
5000|$|The Haverton Hill {{shipyard}} {{opened in}} 1917 under a wartime construction programme. Shipbuilding {{took place at}} <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> from 1919 to 1969 as the Furness Shipbuilding Company under the shipping group Furness Withy. In 1968 <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> was acquired by Swan Hunter who operated <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> for a further decade, and finally by Smith's Dock Co. Ltd who built three ships at <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> in 1978. Shipbuilding ceased in 1979.|$|R
2500|$|Entry of the United States {{into the}} war brought twenty-eight {{destroyer}} orders to <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> Due to this sudden increase in production, <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> needed to expand. Soon, a suitable location was found on nearby Squantum Point, and the Victory Destroyer Plant started construction in 1917. Located on [...] of land, <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> exclusively built destroyers, with [...] being the last ship constructed at the plant. In 1920, <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> {{was turned over to}} the United States government and dismantled. This same year, Bethlehem Steel split off its shipbuilding division into the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, which was headquartered at <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b>|$|R
50|$|During {{the party}} hosted by Amster to inaugurate <b>the</b> <b>Yard,</b> Elsie De Wolfe, mentor to Amster, {{suggested}} {{him to put}} a mirror {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>Yard</b> to give <b>the</b> impression that it was bigger; the mirror is still in place at <b>the</b> <b>Yard</b> today.|$|R
