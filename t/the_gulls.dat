5|$|A gull colony {{has been}} present since 1984, {{although}} gulls were seen briefly {{on the shores}} of the new island only weeks after it first appeared. The gull colony has been particularly important in developing the plant life on Surtsey, and <b>the</b> <b>gulls</b> have had much more of an impact on plant colonisation than other breeding species due to their abundance. An expedition in 2004 found the first evidence of nesting Atlantic puffins, which are extremely common {{in the rest of the}} archipelago.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, 2016, Raymond {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} {{as a free agent}} with the Anaheim Ducks. After making the Ducks opening night roster for the 2016–17 season, Raymond appeared in 4 scoreless games in a depth role before he was reassigned to AHL affiliate, the San Diego Gulls. In declining to report to <b>the</b> <b>Gulls,</b> Raymond and the Ducks mutually agreed to terminate the remainder of his contract on November 3, 2016. In an interview with SportsNet on January 3, 2017, Raymond revealed that he refused to report to the AHL largely to spend time with his wife, who had been diagnosed with Lyme disease.|$|E

50|$|During the Dakota War of 1862, {{which began}} as treaty {{payments}} were due for distribution to the starving Sioux at Fort Ridgely, <b>the</b> <b>Gull</b> Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa rose to attack near-by Fort Ripley. Enmegahbowh prevented other Ojibwa bands from joining <b>the</b> <b>Gull</b> Lake Band, {{for which the}} rebels imprisoned him. Enmegahbowh escaped and traveled thirty miles at night to warn Fort Ripley. This discouraged <b>the</b> <b>Gull</b> Lake Band from attacking the fort. However, many Ojibwe resented Enmegahbowh's actions for years, even though he followed his people (and <b>the</b> <b>Gull</b> Lake band and other Ojibwa) when they were removed to the environs of the Leech Lake Indian Reservation and then eventually to the White Earth Indian Reservation.|$|R
5|$|Laridae is {{a family}} of medium to large seabirds, <b>the</b> <b>gulls,</b> terns, and skimmers. Gulls are {{typically}} grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. Skimmers are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of terns cannot {{accommodate}} under water, so {{they rely}} on accurate sighting from the air before they plunge-dive. Like other seabirds that feed at the surface or dive for food, terns have red oil droplets in the cones of their retinas; birds that have to look through an air/water interface have more deeply coloured carotenoid pigments in the oil drops than other species. The pigment also improves visual contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions, and helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed, or other feeding birds. The red colouring reduces ultraviolet sensitivity, which in any case is an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like <b>the</b> <b>gulls,</b> and this protects the eye from UV damage.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the next}} three matches against Southend, Cheltenham and Accrington Stanley only secured a total of two points, <b>the</b> <b>Gulls</b> could be {{relatively}} satisfied with the returns of a busy month which left them just four points outside of the play-offs and with games in hand {{on most of the}} teams around them.|$|E
25|$|Green {{then left}} the club, to be {{replaced}} at the helm, for the third time, by Frank O'Farrell. O'Farrell didn't stay in charge of team matters for long, bringing in ex-Scotland international Bruce Rioch to become player-coach.

25|$|Regional {{population}} control {{has been used}} on species that cannot be excluded from the airport environment. A nesting colony of laughing gulls at Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge contributed to 98-315 bird strikes per year, from 1979-1992, at adjacent John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). Though JFK had an active bird management program that precluded birds from feeding and loafing on the airport, it did not stop them from overflying the airport to other feeding sites. U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services personnel began shooting all gulls that flew over the airport, hypothesizing that eventually <b>the</b> <b>gulls</b> would alter their flight patterns. They shot 28,352 gulls in two years (approximately half of the population at Jamaica Bay and 5-6% of the nationwide population per year). Strikes with laughing gulls decreased by 89% by 1992. However this was more {{a function of the}} population reduction than <b>the</b> <b>gulls</b> altering their flight pattern (Dolbeer et al. 1993, Dolbeer et al. 2003, DeVault et al. 2013).|$|E

25|$|The auks are {{a family}} of seabirds related to <b>the</b> <b>gulls</b> and terns which {{contains}} several genera. The common murre {{is placed in the}} guillemot (murre) genus Uria (Brisson, 1760), which it shares with the thick-billed murre or Brunnich's guillemot, U. lomvia. These species, together with the razorbill, little auk and the extinct great auk make up the tribe Alcini. This arrangement was originally based on analyses of auk morphology and ecology.|$|E
25|$|In February 1993, with Torquay battling {{against a}} second {{successive}} relegation, {{from the new}} Division Three to the Football Conference, Fashanu applied for the vacant post of manager following Compton's departure, but was turned down in favour of Neil Warnock. Fashanu left Torquay, having scored 15 goals in 41 games for <b>the</b> <b>Gulls.</b> He went to play for Airdrieonians soon after {{but was unable to}} save them from suffering relegation from the Scottish Premier Division.|$|E
25|$|O'Farrell made {{a return}} to Plainmoor in 1976 when Malcolm Musgrove lost his job after a disappointing FA Cup defeat against non-league outfit Hillingdon Borough. He soon moved upstairs into the {{position}} of consultant manager, and ex-Plymouth Argyle promotion-winning captain Mike Green {{was brought in to}} control first team matters.

60|$|This {{was their}} {{answer to the}} South sandhead light, which, having fired three guns and sent up three rockets to attract the {{attention}} of <b>the</b> <b>Gull,</b> then ceased firing. It was also their first note of warning to the look-out on the pier of Ramsgate harbour. Of the three light-ships that guarded <b>the</b> sands, <b>the</b> <b>Gull</b> lay nearest to Ramsgate; hence, whichever of the other two happened to send up signals, <b>the</b> <b>Gull</b> had to reply and thenceforward to continue repeating them until the attention of the Ramsgate look-out should be gained, and a reply given.|$|R
25|$|Torquay {{started the}} 2014–15 {{season in the}} National League poorly losing to Gateshead 1–3 with Ryan Bowman missing a penalty. After that match Torquay had a {{brilliant}} unbeaten run, first beating Welling United 3–0 then drawing 0–0 with Southport and then with Dartford. Yet another draw came when they drew with Aldershot Town 1–1 at home. That was their last draw for a while as they went on a six-game unbeaten run. Starting with a 1–3 away win at Lincoln City then playing at home beating Nuneaton Town 4–0, they were 3–0 up after 30 minutes. <b>The</b> <b>Gulls</b> {{then went on to}} win two away games winning 0–2 in both of them. First winning at Chester then Grimsby (manager Chris Hargreaves' home town). The next game was a home game that was looking to be a 0–0 draw until the 90th minute when can <b>The</b> <b>Gulls</b> captain Luke Young scored an incredible 35 yard free kick to give Torquay the 3 points. A 2–0 win at home against Dover followed, however this was {{to be the end of}} Torquay's 10 game unbeaten run and an indifferent run-in would see United end the season in 13th position.|$|E
25|$|Torquay won {{promotion}} {{again on}} 31 May 1991, winning a play-off final on the club's second visit to Wembley against higher-placed Blackpool. Goals from Wes Saunders and Dean Edwards earned Torquay a 2–2 draw in normal time. No further goals in extra time {{resulted in a}} penalty shoot-out. Successful penalties by Micky Holmes, Wes Saunders, Paul Holmes, Chris Myers and goalkeeper Gareth Howells, combined with Dave Bamber's miss for the opposition, made Torquay winners 5–4 on penalties. <b>The</b> <b>Gulls</b> were promoted to Division Three due to this victory.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>gulls</b> are generalist feeders. Indeed, {{they are}} the least {{specialised}} of all the seabirds, and their morphology allows for equal adeptness in swimming, flying, and walking. They are more adept walking on land than most other seabirds, and the smaller gulls {{tend to be more}} manoeuvrable while walking. The walking gait of gulls includes a slight side to side motion, something that can be exaggerated in breeding displays. In the air, they are able to hover and they are also able to take off quickly with little space.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>gulls</b> have a {{worldwide}} cosmopolitan distribution. They breed on every continent, including {{the margins of}} Antarctica, and {{are found in the}} high Arctic, as well. They are less common on tropical islands, although a few species do live on islands such as the Galapagos and New Caledonia. Many species breed in coastal colonies, with a preference for islands, and one species, the grey gull, breeds in the interior of dry deserts far from water. Considerable variety exists in the family and species may breed and feed in marine, freshwater, or terrestrial habitats.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} season {{proved to}} be a massive disappointment, and Torquay only narrowly avoided relegation to the Football Conference. Matters improved in the 1999–00 season, with a finish of 9th, just three points off the play-offs. However, 2000–01 {{proved to be}} a dreadful season, and Saunders was sacked with the club adrift {{at the bottom of the}} table. He was replaced by Colin Lee, who improved results and gave the club a chance of survival. On 5 May 2001, the final game of the 2000–01 season saw United away to Barnet. Before the start of the game Barnet were bottom of the Third Division, one point behind Torquay. <b>The</b> <b>Gulls</b> needed to avoid defeat to keep their League status, Barnet needed to win. Thousands of fans were locked outside the tiny Underhill ground as United stormed to a 3–0 lead, with goals from Kevin Hill, Jason Rees, and David Graham. Barnet fought back to 3–2, but United held on for the win to condemn Barnet to the Football Conference.|$|E
25|$|Lee {{left at the}} end of {{the season}} and was {{replaced}} by Roy McFarland, who only managed to deliver a mediocre 19th-place finish the following season; McFarland subsequently quit {{at the end of}} the season, in protest of Mike Bateson's decision to sack assistant manager David Preece without consulting McFarland, who was replaced by Leroy Rosenior. 2002–03 would see a major improvement over the previous two campaigns and a finish of 9th place, with only a late run of bad results keeping Torquay out of the play-offs. The end of the 2003–04 season saw United win automatic promotion for the third time in their history, against all odds in a nail-biting finale at Southend. However their stay in the third tier of the football pyramid was only to last for one season, as a final day defeat against Colchester United condemned <b>the</b> <b>Gulls</b> to a return to the 4th division of the leagues after narrowly being edged out by Milton Keynes Dons for safety in Football League One. The fact that it was the MK Dons that had stayed up at Torquay's expense saw messages of sympathy from fans of other clubs, mainly out of a dislike for the franchising of football.|$|E
