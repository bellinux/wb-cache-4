Several proposals have arisen, including creating a [...] "spur" [...] from US41/M-28 through the east end of Ishpeming to meet CR480 west of Negaunee. This spur would pass through recently reopened former mining [...] "caving grounds", and to the south of the Mather A & B Mine complex. According to Gerry Corkin, Marquette County Board Chairman, [...] "the land that was purchased by Ishpeming and Negaunee, the mining company land, this has the potential to help in the development of that if this is compatible.

500|$|Certainly he {{must have}} been a very talented writer, gaining a {{reputation}} of eloquence while he still lived in London (Bethurum, 58). [...] In a letter to him, [...] "the writer asks to be excused from translating something Wulfstan had asked him to render into English and pleads as an excuse his lack of ability in comparison with the bishop’s skill" [...] (58). [...] Similarly, [...] "ne early student of Wulfstan, Einenkel, and his latest editor, Jost, agree in thinking he wrote verse and not prose" [...] (Continuations, 229). [...] This suggests Wulfstan's writing is not only eloquent, but poetic, and among many of his rhetorical devices is marked rhythm (229). [...] <b>Taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Wulfstan's actual manuscripts, presented by Volume 17 of Early English Manuscripts in Facsimile, it becomes apparent that his writing was exceptionally neat and well structured– even his notes in the margins are well organised and tidy, and his handwriting itself is ornate but readable.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Take Back" [...] {{was directed by}} Toku, and took one day to shoot and two days to edit. According to Figlerowicz, who reviewed the singers' DVD compilation 7 Spirits, the video opens with a [...] "young Koda Kumi that has long and black hair. She presents herself in this video in two different ways. In the first one, though wearing a leather dress, she looks natural, gentle and pretty. In the latter one, she is presented with disheveled hair and strange things plaited in it, but despite that, she still attracts the viewer's attention with her enthusiasm flowing out from the screen." [...] In the video, Kumi is accompanied by her three fellow background dancers; they're dancing in a white photo shoot room, while she {{is sitting in a}} white chair. Figlerowicz stated that the dancers complimented the early 2000s music video era: [...] "there are only three dancers near the singer, so it probably wouldn't distinguish from other PVs of the same era." [...] Scenes interspersed through the main video show Koda lying nude on a crimson red Ferrari and clutching a microphone in her hand. Figlerowicz commented that the video, in conjunction with her other videos on 7 Spirits, [...] "didn't appeal to the Japanese audience's tastes [...] With some time, people's opinions of them might change, but they are worth <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Searching for an {{experienced}} left-hander for their bullpen, the Oakland Athletics claimed Breslow off waivers on May 20, 2009.

[...] "I'm excited about <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him", A's Manager Bob Geren said. [...] "He's a left-handed guy that's experienced. He's had some success at this level."

2500|$|On 5 March 2009, Black {{contributed a}} piece to the online {{version of the}} {{conservative}} magazine National Review (NRO). Called Roosevelt and the Revisionists and based on his earlier biography of Roosevelt, it argued that FDR's New Deal was intended to save capitalism, and deserved conservative support. In her 9 March critique of this piece on NRO, author Amity Shlaes observed, [...] "I will be co-hosting, with Dean Thomas Cooley of NYU/Stern, a Second Look conference on March 30 to permit scholars to present the multiple studies that suggest the New Deal and Great Depression are worth <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> from every angle.

2500|$|Game Revolution's Brian Gee {{awarded the}} game a C+. He wrote, [...] "It's {{easy to tell}} what the {{developers}} focused on, because The Bouncer is obviously one of the best-looking games on a console to date. Near flawless animations and picture perfect visuals make it a great choice {{to show off the}} sleek Sony super machine to your friends. Once the game begins, though, The Bouncer sheds it's [...] pretty boy image and gets down and dirty." [...] He was critical of the controls and the absence of a lock-on feature. Like other critics, he also had problems with the camera and the ratio of cutscenes to gameplay. He concluded [...] "Though many will undoubtedly be disappointed by The Bouncers inability {{to live up to the}} hype, others will find a fancy beat 'em up to pass a few hours. Its flashy graphics are at least worth <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> but its many problems just might keep it from a place in the collection." ...|$|E

2500|$|Opinions varied on {{what made}} the public {{thoroughly}} invested in the trial. Safon argued the Anthonys having been a regular and [...] "unremarkable" [...] family with complex relationships made them intriguing to watch. In a special piece for CNN, psychologist Frank Farley described the circumstantial evidence as [...] "all over the map" [...] and that combined with [...] "the apparent lying, significant contradictions and flip-flops of testimony, and questionable or bizarre theories of human behavior, it is little wonder that this nation [...] glued to the tube". He {{said it was a}} trial that was both a psychologist's dream and nightmare, and believes that much of the public's fascination [...] to do with the uncertainty of a motive for the crime. Psychologist Karyl McBride discussed how some mothers stray away from [...] "the saintly archetype" [...] expected of mothers. [...] "We want so badly to hang onto the belief system that mothers don't harm children," [...] she stated. [...] "It's fascinating that the defense in the Anthony case found a way to blame the father. While we don't know what is true and maybe never will, it is worth <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the narcissistic family when maternal narcissism rules the roost.
