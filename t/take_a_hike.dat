5000|$|Kelly Higgins-Devine of the ABC {{joined the}} chorus of praise for the book, and in The Weekend Australian, {{reviewer}} Jack Marx described Mama as [...] "anything but a book about a baby", and described it as [...] "personal, magical, sublimely powerful, and medical jargon can <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hike.</b> Gambotto-Burke’s {{point is that the}} shared experiences of mothers are of a value no PhD can match." [...] He continued: [...] "To suggest a patriarchal plot is not to be a fringe conspiracy theorist. In his 2012 book Sex and Punishment, Eric Berkowitz argued convincingly that ancient lawmakers, spooked by what they saw as the possibility of blokes becoming biologically redundant, had created a society that would condemn motherhood to little more than a masculine factory in which women laboured. This society exists today, motherhood still regarded as a temporary vocation for which one must seek 'leave', presumably from something more important than the raising of emotionally nourished human beings. Together, the voices in Mama push this same barrow, and it makes for an arresting argument." ...|$|E
