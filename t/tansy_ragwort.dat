Effects of dietary <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> (Senecio jacobaea), comfrey (Symphytum officinale), bracken (Pteridium acquilinum) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) on hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes in rats were measured. <b>Tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> and bracken increased (P< 0. 05) the activity of glutathione transferase and epoxide hydrolase. Comfrey and alfalfa increased (P< 0. 05) the activity of aminopyrine Ndemethylase. Feeding bracken or St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) in conjunction with <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> did not influence chronic toxicity of <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> as assessed by rat survival time. Dietary <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> resulted in increased (P< 0. 05) hepatic copper levels; the other plants did not affect copper levels. The results do not suggest any major interaction in the toxicity of <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> with bracken or St. John's wort. Dietary supplementation of rats with branched chain amino acids (BCAA: leucine, isoleucine, valine) did not alter their susceptibility to chronic poisoning by <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> (Senecio jacobaea), which contains hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA).

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Senecio jacobaea (<b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort)</b> is a {{poisonous}} plant responsible for livestock {{deaths in the}} Pacific Northwest. Horses and cattle are susceptible, while sheep are resistant to the toxic action of the pyrrolizidine alkaloids which the plant contains. Hepatic enzymes {{are responsible for the}} biotransformation of pyrrolizidine alkaloids into tissue damaging pyrrole metabolites. The objective of this investigation was to determine the relationship between diet and the toxicity of <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort.</b> In Part A of the study, toxicity of <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> was not found to be significantly altered (P<. 05) after prolonged periods of storage in excess of 2 years, or after heating during the pelleting process. <b>Tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> flowers, leaves, stems and roots were found to differ in toxicity to rats. Flowers and leaves were most toxic to rats, followed by roots. Stems were devoid of toxicity during the 150 day feeding trial. Differences in the relative distribution of two major alkaloids, seneciphylline and jacobine were found in extracts of the plant parts after gas chromatographic analysis. Flowers were highest in seneciphylline while leaves were highest in jacobine. Roots and stems had lower total alkaloid levels. Seneciphylline was most abundant in roots and was the only alkaloid detectable in stems. In a trial where rats were fed diets containing ten percent <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> for varying lengths of time, the chronic nature of pyrrolizidine toxicity was demonstrated. A 1 week feeding period of the toxic diet was enough to kill sixty percent of the rats, some dying months after exposure. The chronic lethal dose for rats was determined to be between 10 and 53 g <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> per kg body weight (P<. 05). The experiments in Part B were designed to determine if <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> is detoxified in the sheep rumen. <b>Tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> was fermented in rumen fluid-buffer mixtures, freeze dried and then fed to rats at the ten percent level. As assessed by survival time of the rats, significant detoxification (P<. 05) did not occur, even after pretreatment of the rumen fluid donor with <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> for 1 or 5 weeks. Likewise, autoclaving the rumen fluid or the addition of iodoform to inhibit rumen methanogenic bacteria had no effect on survival of the rats. While pretreatment and addition of iodoform decreased the acetic:propionic ratio, favoring alkaloid reduction, no detoxification occurred. When incubated and unincubated rumen fluid-tansy ragwort extracts were compared using gas chromatography, neither reduction of alkaloid level or formation of metabolites could be detected as a result of rumen fermentation. These results indicate that <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> is not detoxified as a result of sheep rumen fermentation. In Part C, the interrelationship between nutritional status and the toxicity of <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> was examined. Addition of one percent dietary cysteine had a significant (P<. 05) protective effect against <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> toxicity while phenothiazine, a microsomal enzyme inducer was detrimental. The protective effect of cysteine was not enhanced by phenothiazine, suggesting that cysteine exerts its effect before pyrrole production. A high level of dietary fat (14 percent), significantly (P<. 05) decreased survival time in male and female rats consuming diets containing five percent <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort.</b> Rats fed either deficient amounts of low quality protein (12 percent gelatin) or large amounts of high quality protein (25 percent casein) were significantly (P<. 05) protected against <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> toxicity as assessed by survival time. This suggests that the activity of pyrrole forming enzymes are not as dependent on protein nutrition as are the detoxifying ehzymes. In another experiment, significant (P<. 05) accumulation of spleen and liver copper occurred in rats fed five percent <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> with added dietary copper (50 or 250 ppm). Zinc metabolism {{did not appear to be}} affected, while iron levels in spleen and liver tissue were changed significantly (P<. 05) between the treatments. The trend for iron in these tissues was to increase as <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> was increased.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{dynamics}} of <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort,</b> Senecio jacobaea L., and the cinnabar moth, Tyria jacobaeae (L.) were studied {{with the aid}} of a system simulation model. The model development and validation were based on knowledge of the plant and herbivore gathered from the literature, four years of data from previous studies in Oregon, and supplemental field studies conducted after early model development. Life table data for the herbivore, and growth and regrowth studies of the plant, provided information needed to estimate model parameters. Model-simulated annual changes in ragwort density and cinnabar pupae were within acceptable limits of field estimates made at a study site near Jordan, Oregon, during 1972 - 1977. After validation of the model, sensitivity analyses and simulation experiments were used to evaluate the potential of cinnabar moth as a biological control of <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort.</b> Model simulations were used to suggest conditions under which cinnabar moth can reduce ragwort to low levels and maintain control, and to define when the herbivore cannot control the weed without the aid of other tactics. Maintenance of ragwort at low levels is associated with: (1) defoliation above 95 %, (2) ragwort regrowth after defoliation of 90 % or less, (3) seed germination rate of 1 % or less if regrowth is good, (4) stage-specific herbivore mortalities of 25 % or less, and (5) an extended period of moth emergence with oviposition of 40 eggs per plant or higher. Significant deviation from these levels by any one of these factors suppresses the ability of cinnabar moth to maintain low levels of the ragwort. The five conditions are interrelated such that a change in one factor can be compensated for by an opposing change in another. Other control tactics were investigated in model simulations to evaluate their compatibility with cinnabar moth. Simulation experiments suggested that cinnabar moth used with cultural control or the flea beetle, Longitarsus jacobaea L., can reduce ragwort levels below the level achieved by cinnabar moth alone. These results are qualified by assumptions concerning the activities of flea beetle and the effects of cultural practices. Whether cinnabar moth has high potential as a biological control of <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort</b> depends upon site-specific environmental conditions and the desired level of control. In model simulations, ragwort biomass decreased sharply only when plant growth and regrowth was poor and defoliation level was high.

There are many cases of plant-related toxicoses suffered by ruminant animals {{where there are no}} microbes known to offer protection. Ergot alkaloids produced by the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium coenophialum have been shown to cause the syndromes of fescue foot and summer slump in animals grazing tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) grass varieties that carry the endophyte. Economic losses due to these diseases have been estimated to be about 1 billion per year. For this reason, it is economically desirable to find one or more microbes that could be introduced into the rumen environment to protect animals from fescue toxicosis and pyrrolizidine alkaloid toxicosis. Studies that have found protective microbes focused on identification of those microbes using mainly phenotyping and enrichment or isolation techniques. In the studies presented here, two different experimental and environmental systems were examined. Culture-independent molecular biology techniques were used to take advantage of differences found between bacteria in the 16 S small ribosomal subunit gene as a means of characterizing diversity. Analytical chemistry techniques were used to place diversity observations in the context of function. Microbes within a consortia culture derived from the rumen of a sheep were previously shown to metabolize pyrrolizidine alkaloids found in the invasive weed, <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort.</b> Thin layer chromatography was used to monitor microbial activity. The bacterial enrichment was characterized by molecular cloning techniques and by the molecular fingerprinting technique of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Phylogenetic analysis of the enrichment revealed that the consortium is composed of no more than five putative bacterial species which associated to the Anaerovibrio, Desulfovibrio, Megasphaera, Prevotella, and Synergistes generas. The DGGE results were directly compared to the cloning data by amplifying eight phylogenetically representative clones by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analyzing them by DGGE. Direct DGGE analysis of the enrichment displayed greater 16 S diversity than the clone library used in this study, suggesting {{that at least one of}} the organisms present in the enrichment comprises less than 1...|$|E
40|$|It has {{previously}} been demonstrated by others that acetone extracts of Senecio jacobaea (syn. Jacobaea vulgaris, common or <b>tansy</b> <b>ragwort)</b> test positive in the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test (Ames test). Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) {{are thought to be}} responsible for these mutagenic effects. However, it was also observed that the major PA present in common ragwort, jacobine, produced a negative response (with and without the addition of rat liver S 9) in Salmonella test strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535 and TA 1537. To investigate which compounds in the plant extracts were responsible for the positive outcome, the present study investigated the contents and mutagenic effects of methanol and acetone extracts prepared from dried ground S. jacobaea and Senecio inaequidens (narrow-leafed ragwort). Subsequently, a fractionation approach was set up in combination with LC-MS/MS analysis of the fractions. It was shown that the positive Ames test outcomes of S. jacobaea extracts are unlikely to be caused by PAs, but rather by the flavonoid quercetin. This study also demonstrates the importance of identifying compounds responsible for positive test results in bioassays. </p...|$|E
