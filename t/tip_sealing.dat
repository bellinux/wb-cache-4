5000|$|Blade <b>tip</b> <b>sealing</b> {{has been}} a {{challenging}} problem since {{the development of the}} gas turbine engine. It is such because the clearance between the blade tips and surrounding casing (shroud) tends to vary due primarily to changes in thermal and mechanical loads on the rotating (turbine wheel) and stationary (stator, turbine casing) structures.|$|E
5000|$|During normal cruise flight, {{the engine}} is exposed to many loads such as intense heat and {{centrifugal}} force. This causes expansion of certain components and alters {{the gap between the}} turbine casing and tips of the spinning turbine blades. The amount of air leaking around, past the edge of the blades without passing through them is critical to engine performance and fuel efficiency. For this reason since the late 1960s, blade <b>tip</b> <b>sealing</b> has taken on a prominent role in aircraft engine design. The ACC system dynamically controls the High Pressure Turbine (HPT) blade clearance. This can be achieved in numerous ways.|$|E
40|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in room air conditioning cycles, package air conditioning cycles, refrigeration, water heater and automobile air conditioning cycles as well as air compressors, helium compressors and vacuum pump. There are two main leakage paths in a compression chamber formed by a fixed scroll and an orbiting scroll. One is the leakage path through a radial clearance between the wraps of fixed and orbiting scroll. The leakage through the radial clearance is prevented by pressing the orbiting scroll radially against the fixed scroll by a mechanism such as a compliance mechanism. Oil inside the compression chamber also has the sealing effect and reduces the leakage through the radial clearance. Another leakage path is an axial clearance which is the clearance between a tip of the scroll wrap and a base plate. A <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> {{is often used to}} prevent the leakage through the axial clearance. Although there have been many studies on the <b>tip</b> <b>seal,</b> the seal mechanism of the <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> is not thoroughly clarified yet, and the influence of design parameters on efficiency of the <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> is unclear. In addition, the relationship between the sealing effect and a frictional loss of the <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> is also not validated well. In this study, a test apparatus which can evaluate the sealing effect and the frictional loss of the <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> simultaneously is developed. The influence of several design parameters on the sealing effect and the frictional loss is examined with the test apparatus. By measuring pressure distribution around the <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> in a <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> groove, the sealing mechanism of the <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> is clarified and a design guideline of the <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> groove is obtained...|$|R

Volumetric efficiency is calculated for three <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> configurations and presented {{as a function of}} pressure ratio. It is determined that a two piece seal that expands axially results in less leakage. Further, it is determined that fluid pressure activation of the <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> improves performance and eliminates the need for a highly loaded biasing spring.

50|$|The car {{developed}} an early reputation for unreliability. The Ro 80 engine in particular suffered from construction faults, {{among many other}} problems, and some early cars required a rebuilt engine before 50000 km, with problems arising as early as 24000 km. The three-piece rotor <b>tip</b> <b>seals</b> were made {{out of the same}} material. The design fault caused the center section to have higher abrasion at cold starts than the corner pieces and the <b>tip</b> <b>seals</b> could push together, allowing the gas to blow past. With a changed <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> design this was temporarily solved and with a <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> center piece made of Ferrotic, the problem was entirely resolved. The fact that the rotary engine design was inherently thirsty (typically 13-16 l/100 km) and a poor understanding of the Wankel engine by dealers and mechanics did not help this situation. By the 1970 model year, most of the reliability issues had been resolved, but a necessarily generous warranty policy and damage to the car's reputation had undermined NSU's financial situation irreparably. NSU was acquired by Volkswagen in 1969, and merged with Auto Union to create the modern day Audi company as it is known today.|$|R

The Legacy engine offers significant advances over conventional internal combustion engines in 1) power to weight ratio; 2) multiple fuel acceptance; 3) fuel economy; and 4) environmental compliance. These advances are achieved {{through a combination of}} innovative design geometry, rotary motion, aspiration simplicity, and manufacturing/part simplicity. The key technical challenge to the Legacy engineâs commercialization, and the focus of this project, was the development of a viable roton <b>tip</b> <b>seal.</b> The PST concept for the roton <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> was developed into a manufacturable design. The design was evaluated using a custom designed and fabricated seal test fixture and further refined. This design was incorporated into the GEN 2. 5 A prototype and tested for achievable compression pressure. The Decision Point at the end of Phase 1 of the project (described below) was to further optimize the existing <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> design. Enhancements to the <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> design were incorporated into the GEN 2. 5 B prototype and tested and evaluated using the iterative research strategy described below. Compression pressures adequate for compression ignition of diesel fuel were achieved, although not consistently in all combustion volumes. The variation in compression pressures was characterized versus design features. As the roton <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> performance was improved, results pointed toward inadequate performance of the housing side seals. Enhancement of the housing side seal system was accomplished using a custom designed side seal test fixture. The design enhancements developed with the test fixture were also incorporated into the GEN 2. 5 B prototype and tested and evaluated using the iterative research strategy described below.

Larger fiber size, higher density feltmetal showed greatly improved erosion resistance with a slight reduction in abradability compared to the baseline feltmetal. Pack aluminide coating of the honeycomb extended the oxidation resistance and slightly improved the abradability of this material. Evaluation through selected abradability, erosion and oxidation testing, and pertinent metallography led to selection of a plasma sprayed yttria stabilized zirconia (ZrO 2) /CoCrAlY layered system as the system with the most potential to meet the 1589 K requirement for blade <b>tip</b> <b>seals.</b> This system demonstrated structural integrity, erosion resistance, and some degree of abradability...|$|R

40|$|Improved blade <b>tip</b> <b>sealing</b> in {{the high}} {{pressure}} compressor (HPC) and high pressure turbine (HPT) can provide dramatic reductions in specific fuel consumption (SFC), time-on-wing, compressor stall margin, and engine efficiency as well as increased payload and mission range capabilities. Maintenance costs to overhaul large commercial gas turbine engines can easily exceed $ 1 M. Engine removal from service is primarily due to spent exhaust gas temperature (EGT) margin caused mainly by the deterioration of HPT components. Increased blade tip clearance {{is a major factor}} in hot section component degradation. As engine designs continue to push the performance envelope with fewer parts and the market drives manufacturers to increase service life, the need for advanced sealing continues to grow. A review of aero gas turbine engine HPT performance degradation and the mechanisms that promote these losses are discussed. Benefits to the HPT due to improved clearance management are identified.

40|$|Gas path sealing {{has always}} been a very {{important}} issue for jet engines, and in the last years the consciousness of the presence of a consistent improvement margin for turbine clearances pushed research investments in this direction. The improvement of <b>tip</b> <b>sealing</b> affects specific fuel consumption, service time, and most of the engine performances in general. Usually the main interest in this kind of studies is addressed to the axisymetric deformation of the casings, while in the last times a new concern on asymmetry and on the possibility to assess and control its development has been growing. This work is lined on this trend of research, since it regards the assessment of the thermally generated asymmetry of turbine casings. The study makes use of the nowadays unescapable mean of the finite element analysis, implemented via specific softwares. It is particularly concerned with the very preliminary assessment of the deformation, and it takes the form of the trial of a new methodology for the analysis, with comparison with other experienced techniques.

40|$|Improved blade <b>tip</b> <b>sealing</b> in {{the high}} {{pressure}} compressor and high pressure turbine can provide dramatic improvements in specific fuel consumption, time-on-wing, compressor stall margin and engine efficiency as well as increased payload and mission range capabilities of both military and commercial gas turbine engines. The preliminary design of a mechanically actuated active clearance control (ACC) system for turbine blade tip clearance management is presented along with {{the design of a}} bench top test rig in which the system is to be evaluated. The ACC system utilizes mechanically actuated seal carrier segments and clearance measurement feedback to provide fast and precise active clearance control throughout engine operation. The purpose of this active clearance control system is to improve upon current case cooling methods. These systems have relatively slow response and do not use clearance measurement, thereby forcing cold build clearances to set the minimum clearances at extreme operating conditions (e. g., takeoff, re-burst) and not allowing cruise clearances to be minimized due to the possibility of throttle transients (e. g., step change in altitude). The active turbine blade tip clearance control system design presented herein will be evaluated to ensure that proper response and positional accuracy is achievable under simulated high-pressure turbine conditions. The test rig will simulate proper seal carrier pressure and temperature loading as well as the magnitudes and rates of blade tip clearance changes of an actual gas turbine engine. The results of these evaluations will be presented in future works...|$|E

This work is concentrated on the development of self-adaptive clearance control systems for gas turbine engines. Researchers have targeted the high-pressure turbine (HPT) blade <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> location for following reasons: Current active clearance control (ACC) systems (e. g., thermal case-cooling schemes) cannot respond to blade tip clearance changes due to mechanical, thermal, and aerodynamic loads. As such they are prone to wear due to the required tight running clearances during operation. Blade <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> wear (increased clearances) reduces engine efficiency, performance, and service life.

40|$|Flow through {{tip shroud}} cavity in a {{representative}} axial turbine vane-rotor stage environment is assessed for {{its role in}} loss generation and turbine durability. Steady and unsteady three-dimensional flow computations, complemented by control volume analyses, for varying shroud configurations provided results for establishing quantitative links between loss and ow processes as well as loss level scalings. Specifically tip shroud cavity flow is dominated by two counter-rotating vortices upstream, and a free expansion leakage jet downstream, of the <b>tip</b> <b>seal,</b> followed by a mixing shear layer at cavity exit. One of the vortices, the cavity inlet toroidal vortex, sets the loss level within the cavity inlet and the mass ow recirculated out of the cavity into the main flow path. It is found that tip shroud cavity flow incurs a 0 : 85 % debit in stage eciency per 1 % of main flow fluid through the cavity with approximately 50 % generated in the free expansion of the <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> leakage jet and 50 % from cavity exit mixing. The proportion of total loss attributable to cavity exit mixing increases with <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> gap. In addition, vane-rotor unsteady interaction induces an additional 0 : 25 % debit in eciency per 1 % of main flow fluid through the cavity. The additional efficiency penalty induced by vane-rotor unsteady interaction results from an enhancement of the cavity inlet toroidal vortex and associated recirculated mass flow. Overall cavity loss is set by cavity mass flow fraction, stagnation pressure ratio across <b>tip</b> <b>seal,</b> velocity disparity between cavity exit flow and rotor exit flow, and cavity inlet vortex strength. These findings were used to formulate a modified tip shroud configuration that nearly eliminates cavity exit mixing loss, but it incurs a penalty associated with cavity flow low Reynolds number effects and induced mismatching between vane and modified tip shroud. In the process of designing this modified tip shroud, {{it was found that}} the turbine main flow perceives the cavity as a line sink-source pair, permitting estimation of flow redistribution in the main flow path. Finally, any operational transients which eliminate <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> clearance would lead to enhanced impingement heat transfer at blade tip due to recirculating ow from cavity inlet; this can increase the likelihood of blade failure. by Timothy R.

We made permeability measurements by inserting the <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> of an air permeameter in the matrix of these samples and compared them to the permeability of the composite sample determined by both water-based methods and theory. The air-permeameter measurements made in this way represent the permeability of the composite mixtures of coarser and finer grains and allow for the discernment of permeability between samples with different matrix compositions, ranging from fine to coarse sand. Furthermore, the collective results show that permeability differences in the pebbly sands and variably sorted sands with fine packing, however measured, are primarily {{due to differences in}} matrix permeability and not due to differences in the size or the percentage of the coarser grains...|$|R
40|$|Controlling {{interface}} clearances is {{the most}} cost effective method of enhancing turbomachinery performance. Seals control turbomachinery leakages, coolant flows and contribute to overall system rotordynamic stability. In many instances, sealing interfaces and coatings are sacrificial, like lubricants, giving up their integrity {{for the benefit of}} the component. They are subjected to abrasion, erosion, oxidation, incursive rubs, foreign object damage (FOD) and deposits as well as extremes in thermal, mechanical, aerodynamic and impact loadings. Tribological pairing of materials control how well and how long these interfaces will be effective in controlling flow. A variety of seal types and materials are required to satisfy turbomachinery sealing demands. These seals must be properly designed to maintain the interface clearances. In some cases, this will mean machining adjacent surfaces, yet in many other applications, coatings are employed for optimum performance. Many seals are coating composites fabricated on superstructures or substrates that are coated with sacrificial materials which can be refurbished either in situ or by removal, stripping, recoating and replacing until substrate life is exceeded. For blade and knife <b>tip</b> <b>sealing</b> an important class of materials known as abradables permit blade or knife rubbing without significant damage or wear to the rotating element while maintaining an effective sealing interface. Most such tip interfaces are passive, yet some, as for the high-pressure turbine (HPT) case or shroud, are actively controlled. This work presents an overview of turbomachinery sealing. Areas covered include: characteristics of gas and steam turbine sealing applications and environments, benefits of sealing, types of standard static and dynamics seals, advanced seal designs, as well as life and limitations issues...|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 57 - 64 Many of the {{mechanical}} drive steam turbines in service {{in the world today}} were designed without the demands for optimum efficiency. In order to meet the changing economic requirements that plants face, technological solutions have been developed to improve turbine performance that can be sustained during extended run times. This is in contrast to making conventional component replacements with short-lived or limited gains in performance. Another important consideration is that performance upgrades must be made without adversely impacting the turbine?s operating characteristics, especially those during startup. Turbine efficiency is significantly affected by the performance of shaft and <b>tip</b> <b>seals</b> that control steam leakage within the machine. Conventional seals {{have a long history of}} sacrificing operational characteristics by rubbing during unit startup and producing vibration problems that can result in aborted startups. Extended startups are the short-term loss, yet the loss of installed seal clearances has a cumulative financial impact over the operational run cycle.

40|$|This study {{presents}} an empirical method {{to calculate the}} bypass leakage mass flow rate along the <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> in a scroll compressor. The leakage flows through small axial and radial clearances between the orbiting and fixed scrolls of scroll compressor were previously studied by Ishii et al. In these earlier studies, the pressure decay in the pressurized vessel due to leakage through the axial and radial clearances was measured using a maximum pressure of 3 MPa for CO 2 and 0. 6 MPa for R 22. The Darcy-Weisbach equation for incompressible, viscous fluid flow through the thin rectangular cross-section was applied to calculate the leakage mass flow rate that matched the pressure decay characteristics. The empirical friction factors were determined and plotted on a Moody diagram. As a result, the empirical friction factors for both axial and radial clearance leakage flows have been determined and shown to take on essentially the same value for both CO 2 and R 22, despite the significantly different working pressures. In contrast, the flow patterns in bypass leakage along the <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> are so complicated that not even the leakage characteristics are known definitively. No method exists for calculating the bypass leakage mass flow rate. In the present study, a bypass leakage model was constructed, compatible with a production-type scroll compressor with a large cooling capacity. A similar test of the pressure decay in the pressurized vessel due to bypass leakages were conducted with the refrigerant gas R 410 A. The measured pressure decay characteristics were then simulated by the Darcy-Weisbach equation with the empirical friction factors from our previous study for the leakage flow through the axial clearance. In the present simulations of the measured pressure decay, the complicated flow patterns through bypass clearances were classified into two representative rectangular thin cross-section leakage passes, one with an equivalent width {{and the other with}} an equivalent length. Empirical friction factor values for the equivalent pass width and length were determined to match the measured pressure decays. As a result, the calculation of the bypass leakage flow rate along the <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> in scroll compressors can be accomplished using a simple scheme in terms of the equivalent pass width and equivalent pass length for two representative leakage passes forming a thin rectangular cross-section and applying empirically determined friction factors,...|$|R
40|$|Research to {{understand}} the mechanisms of wear within {{the main components of}} three different micro-CHP scroll expander systems was conducted. This was performed in order to identify the possible tribo-mechanical effects (abrasion, adhesion, cavitation, fatigue) which occur on the substrate of these components during the operation of the scroll which can seriously affect the lifecycle of the micro-CHP unit. Three-dimensional interferometer, surface scanning and scanning electron rnicroscopy (SEM) were used for surface analyses. The critical components for durability were identified on the <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> and the steel plate of the scroll expander. Abrasive wear derived from a two-body contact on the interface of the <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> and the steel plate. Three-body wear was found across the steel plate of the scroll. Finally, cavitation pits were revealed. Interestingly, cavitation was generated by the increment of pressure. It was found that sufficiently high pressure can liquefy instantaneously part of the refrigerant close to the bottom boundary, creating conditions for the generation of cavitation bubbles within the liquefied refrigerant. This finding resolves the puzzle of how the refrigerant which enters the scroll in gas phase produces cavitation. The wear mechanisms identified can significantly reduce the performance of the scroll. Specimens made from the steel plate (high carbon steel) and the <b>tip</b> <b>seal</b> (high performance reinforced fluoroelastomer) of the scroll expander were used for bench tests. The parts were used to perform sliding tribological tests using a special purpose-built modified micro-friction machine TE 57 in order to clearly identify the sliding wear and friction mechanisms. These tests were performed under a specific load and lubrication regime. The experimental conditions were adjusted to those of the industrial applications. Furthermore an experimental study using an ultrasonic transducer (submerged into the fluids) was utilised to produce cavitation bubbles. Using high-speed camera techniques the bubbles were observed within the working fluids. A thorough investigation of the dynamic behaviour of the bubbles and their cavitation mechanisms was conducted using the two scroll fluids (lubricant/refrigerant). The experimental results were effectively correlated with the computational ones. Additionally, the impact of the scroll fluid cavities across the surface of various commercial steel grades, including the actual steel plate of the scroll, was determined. Finally, their cavitation performance and durability, over a prolonged period of time was investigated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Features of the system include improved clearance control when blade tips preferentially wear the shrouds and a superior single crystal superalloy tip. The tip design, joint location, characterization of the single crystal tip alloy, the abrasive tip treatment, and the component and engine test are among the factors addressed. Results of wear testing, quality control plans, and the total manufacturing cycle required to fully process the blades are also discussed...|$|R

Methods of improvement of the cyclic thermal shock resistance of the sprayed zirconia seal system were investigated. The most promising method, reduction of the ceramic thickness and metallic substrate stiffness were selected based upon potential and feasibility. Specimens were fabricated and experimentally evaluated to: (1) substantiate {{the capacity of the}} geometry changes to reduce operating stresses in the sprayed structure; and (2) define the abradability, erosion, thermal shock and physical property characteristic for the sprayed ceramic seal system. Thermal stress analysis was performed and correlated with thermal shock test results...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 95 - 110 A {{case study}} of a remanufacture of a steam turbine is presented. The turbine has been in service for 20 years. Thermal and {{physical}} stresses have taken their toll on the turbine casing and supporting hardware. Remanufacture was planned with innovative processes and state-of-the-art component upgrades. A unique heat treatment process was designed to reshape the casing and relieve residual stresses thermally induced into the casing over its operating life. Using heat to reshape the case minimized the amount of remachining time required. A team of three vendors was combined to maximize technical and physical resources and accomplish this task in 24 days. The goals of the remanufacture included: ? Recovery of lost horsepower and efficiency due to steam path deterioration ? Increase efficiency {{through the application of}} packing, <b>tip,</b> and nozzle <b>seal</b> upgrades ? Elimination of chronic maintenance problems. Major topics include: ? Casing disassembly and damage assessment ? Weld restoration of erosion damage and steam path blading ? Distortion modelling and evaluation ? Heat treatment of case ? Assessment of heat treatment results ? Machining steps required ? Design and installation of retractable packing ? Design and installation of <b>tip</b> <b>seals</b> and nozzle seals ? Successful startup and operational histor...|$|R
