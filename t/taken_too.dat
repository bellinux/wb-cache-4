5|$|Since the Spanish Armament of 1790, the Royal Navy {{had been}} at sea {{in a state of}} {{readiness}} for over three years. The Navy's dockyards under First Lord of the Admiralty Charles Middleton were all fully fitted and prepared for conflict. This was quite unlike the disasters of the American Revolutionary War ten years earlier, when an ill-prepared Royal Navy had <b>taken</b> <b>too</b> long to reach full effectiveness and was consequently unable to support the North American campaign—which ended in defeat at the Battle of Yorktown due to lack of supplies. With British dockyards now readily turning out cannon, shot, sails, provisions and other essential equipment, the only remaining problem was that of manning the several hundred ships on the Navy list.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{intended to}} use other Batman characters in the game, but these were removed when it was decided they would not work within the story. For example, Batman's enemy Mr. Freeze did not fit because the character has different motivations to the Joker. Unlike the Riddler, who is obsessed with proving his superiority over Batman, Mr. Freeze does not hold a personal grudge against Batman, and Mr. Freeze would not care about the other villains' plans. A garden maze under Poison Ivy's control was considered as a location; she could grow it in different directions. In its center, Batman would find the Mad Hatter hosting a tea-party, but the developers decided these ideas would not match the game's tone. Batman's vehicles, the Batmobile and Batwing, were considered {{for inclusion in the}} game, but developing unique control mechanics and gameplay segments for them would have <b>taken</b> <b>too</b> much time, and compromised its quality; the vehicles appear in the game, but players cannot control them.|$|E
5|$|The programmers {{identified}} {{early on}} that pathfinding—the ability of the variable-sized characters to navigate through the environment—would be a problem. Huebner cited the difficulty of programming characters to navigate {{an environment in which}} level designers are free to add stairs, ramps, and other 3D objects. They came up with a temporary solution and planned to improve the pathfinding later into development. By the time they properly addressed the problem, many of the levels were almost complete and featured few markers the programmers could use to control movement. They could identify walkable tiles but not walls, cliffs, and other environmental hazards. Ideal solutions, such as creating zones for characters could walk through would have <b>taken</b> <b>too</b> much time to retroactively add into the 100 created levels, so the programmers spent several weeks making small, iterative fixes to conceal the obvious errors in the pathfinding and leave less obvious ones intact.|$|E

5|$|From exile on Elba {{fifteen years}} later, Napoleon {{analyzed}} the Battle of Stockach and the French defeat: its cause, he concluded, lay in Jourdan's division of force. Although Jourdan had increased concentration from his dispositions at Ostrach, the French force was still over-extended. Against a more concentrated force, the Austrians {{could not have}} moved troops from the left to reinforce the right flank when Saint Cyr and Vandamme attacked from front and rear. Furthermore, Napoleon averred, Ferino's force on the French right had not been concentrated sufficiently and d'Hautpoul's cavalry assault had <b>taken</b> <b>too</b> long to materialize, giving the Austrians the upper hand. The Austrian left had halted his assault, freeing men from the southern flank to reinforce the northern one. Importantly, the Austrian line was short enough that troops could move quickly from the southern flank to the northern one. Furthermore, Napoleon argued, Jourdan had retreated north-northwest, to the Black Forest to protect Alsace. He should have retreated south, to join with André Masséna's well-positioned Army of Helvetia, where in combination the Army of Helvetia and the Army of the Danube could have combined forces to defeat the Habsburg army. With Jourdan's misguided overall strategy, Napoleon asserted, the French snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.|$|E
25|$|Another theory {{explaining}} {{the existence of}} the seacoast in Bohemia offered by C. H. Herford is suggested in Shakespeare's chosen title of the play.

25|$|Christine El Mahdy, an Egyptologist, {{argues that}} Tutankhamun {{died of natural}} causes, which she {{believes}} was most likely a tumor of some sort. She uses the original assumption from Carter's examination that Tutankhamun had a quick burial ceremony since some elements of the mummification appeared rushed, as proof {{that he needed to}} be buried quickly following his unexpected death because the man who was next in line for the throne wanted to avoid a power struggle that might have occurred if the burial process had <b>taken</b> <b>too</b> long. By speeding up the burial ceremony, the new pharaoh maintained order in Egypt.|$|E
25|$|Planetesimals at a {{distance}} of 1astronomical unit (AU), the distance of the Earth from the Sun, probably did not contribute any water to the Earth because the solar nebula was too hot for ice to form and the hydration of rocks by water vapor would have <b>taken</b> <b>too</b> long. The water must have been supplied by meteorites from the outer asteroid belt and some large planetary embryos from beyond 2.5AU. Comets may also have contributed. Though most comets are today in orbits farther away from the Sun than Neptune, computer simulations show that they were originally far more common in the inner parts of the solar system.|$|E
25|$|Worth {{returned}} to Florida {{at the beginning}} of November 1842. He soon decided that Tiger Tail and Otiarche had <b>taken</b> <b>too</b> long to make up their minds on what to do, and ordered that they be brought in. Tiger Tail was so ill that he had to be carried on a litter, and he died in New Orleans waiting for transportation to the Indian territory. The other Indians in northern Florida were also captured and sent west. By April 1843 only one regiment, the Eighth Infantry, was still in Florida. In November 1843 Worth reported that the only Indians left in Florida were 42 Seminole warriors, 33 Mikasukis, 10 Creeks and 10 Tallahassees, with women and children bringing the total to about 300. Worth also stated that these Indians were all living on the reservation and were no longer a threat to the white population of Florida.|$|E

25|$|Docherty's {{transfer}} manoeuvrings initially paid off. Chelsea, with Osgood at {{the heart}} of the team, topped the league table in October 1966, the only unbeaten side after ten league games. But Osgood broke his leg in a League Cup tie and the side's momentum was disrupted. To replace Osgood, Docherty immediately signed striker Tony Hateley for a club record £100,000, but Hateley's aerial game did not suit Chelsea's style and he struggled to fit in. They drifted down the league and finished ninth. The highlight of that season was reaching the FA Cup final. En route to that final was a win over Leeds United in the semi-finals, the game widely seen as the one which kicked off the fierce rivalry between the two clubs. In his finest moment for Chelsea, Hateley headed in what proved to be the winner, but in a hotly contested match, Leeds had two goals disallowed, one for offside and one for a Peter Lorimer free-kick <b>taken</b> <b>too</b> quickly.|$|E
25|$|After {{evaluating}} AA's {{literature and}} observing AA meetings for sixteen months, sociologists David R. Rudy and Arthur L. Greil {{found that for}} an AA member to remain sober {{a high level of}} commitment is necessary. This commitment is facilitated by a change in the member's worldview. To help members stay sober AA must, they argue, provide an all-encompassing worldview while creating and sustaining an atmosphere of transcendence in the organization. To be all-encompassing AA's ideology places an emphasis on tolerance rather than on a narrow religious worldview that could make the organization unpalatable to potential members and thereby limit its effectiveness. AA's emphasis on the spiritual nature of its program, however, is necessary to institutionalize a feeling of transcendence. A tension results from the risk that the necessity of transcendence, if <b>taken</b> <b>too</b> literally, would compromise AA's efforts to maintain a broad appeal. As this tension {{is an integral part of}} AA, Rudy and Greil argue that AA is best described as a quasi-religious organization.|$|E
25|$|Although {{he was the}} long-time {{favourite}} for the 2011 Epsom Derby, stamina doubts {{meant that}} Frankel did not run in what many consider racing's Blue Riband race. Instead, his next start was in the St. James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot on 14 June. In the race, the pacemaker, Rerouted, set a furious pace and opened up a sizeable lead by half-way. Frankel was then asked by jockey Tom Queally {{to go after the}} leader and passed Rerouted shortly after the three-furlong marker, going on to open up a lead of six lengths {{on the rest of the}} field with two furlongs to go. However, in the final furlong, 20-1 shot Zoffany began to make up significant ground and Frankel eventually only won by three-quarters of a length. Following the race, Queally received criticism from a number of quarters for what some considered to be an ill-judged ride, since the mid-race move appeared possibly to have <b>taken</b> <b>too</b> much of a toll on the horse. Despite claims from Cecil and Queally that Frankel was merely idling in front, some observers saw the race as the first time the colt looked less than invulnerable.|$|E
