The engines were housed {{in what is now}} called the Engine Room, while the Lantern Room held multiple lead acid batteries. After <b>opening,</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> was made to relocate the estate's entire sawmill to the building, to enable better access to electrical power.

50|$|However, Hong Kong's Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) {{unexpectedly}} {{refused to}} endorse BCal because many influential {{people in the}} Crown Colony felt very upset that Cathay Pacific {{was going to be}} excluded from one of the world's most lucrative air routes. This caused a minor diplomatic row between the UK government and the colonial administration in Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific immediately began a back-door lobbying campaign in the Crown Colony as well as in London, stressing that it had invested millions of pounds in the British economy at a time of high unemployment in the UK by placing large orders for Rolls-Royce RB211-powered Boeing 747s. The UK government allowed Cathay Pacific and Laker to appeal to John Nott, the British Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, against the CAA's decision.

Using a new database that tracks <b>the</b> annual <b>opening</b> and closing <b>decisions</b> of 285 developed North American gold mines {{in the period}} 1988 - 1997, we confirm many of the predictions from real options models. As predicted, the empirical results demonstrate that {{the probability that a}} mine is open is related to market-wide factors (including the level and volatility of the gold price and the interest rate) as well as to mine-specific factors (including the mine's fixed costs, variable costs, and reserves.) These results are both statistically significant and economically material. There is strong evidence of hysteresis, which would result from non-zero opening and closing costs. Together, the data provide strong support for the real options model as a useful model to describe and predict a mine's <b>opening</b> and shutting <b>decisions.</b> In addition, we find that the decision whether to shut a mine is related to firm-specific managerial factors not normally considered within a strict real options model, most notably the profitability of other mines in the firm's portfolio and of the firm's other businesses.

40|$|River bed control {{structure}} what so called groundsill or bottom sill is built for controlling a river bed to remain stable against degradation. Unlike other river obstacles, {{the presence of}} groundsill might cause sediment retention upstream of the structure; hence it reduces the supply of sediment to the downstream part of the river. At some extent, the above situation might create unexpected negative impact, not only cease the sediment migration but also disable fish migration, {{as well as the}} utilization of river for navigation. This paper presents the hydraulic investigation on various models of groundsill, i. e. groundsill without <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> and groundsill with a certain type of <b>the</b> <b>opening.</b> Series of laboratory experiments were conducted on an open channel flow of 0. 75 m width and longitudinal slope of 0. 05 %. There were two types of groundsill, i. e. groundsill without <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> with 0. 75 m width and 0. 05 m height, and groundsill with <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of 0. 39 m width and 0. 005 m height of crest at <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> and 0. 05 m at the wings. Various flow rates were then introduced, necessary data were taken, and the hydraulic phenomena were studied. The results showed that groundsill without <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> produced non-dimensional (relative to the channel width) scour depth of 0. 036, and scour length of 0. 253. Groundsill with <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> produced scour depth of 0. 013 and 0. 024 near the downstream end of the wing section and <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> respectively. <b>The</b> scour length of the groundsill with <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> is 0. 080 and 0. 293 near the downstream end of the wing section and <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> section respectively. Moreover, it can be noted that the presence of the scour depth and scour length of the groundsill with <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> was generally much smaller rather than that of groundsill without <b>the</b> <b>opening.</b> <b>The</b> above results give the evidence that groundsill with <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> is much friendlier and also more suitable for the environment needs.
