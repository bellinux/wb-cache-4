40|$|This paper explores how contextual {{uncertainty}} {{and the use}} of the budgetary system explain cross-sectional variation in <b>the</b> organisational <b>role</b> <b>of</b> business unit controllers.

Thus, we explore both the direct effect <b>of</b> uncertainty on <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controller and the indirect effect through <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> budgetary control system. Using survey data from 134 business unit controllers, we find that uncertainty provides a partial explanation of the variation in <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> budgetary control systems and in <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> controllers. In particular, our data suggest alignment between the coercive (enabling) use of the budgetary control system and <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> controllers acting as corporate policemen (business partners).
