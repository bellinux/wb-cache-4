5|$|The {{approach}} in these sheep experiments involves irradiating a ram’s <b>testes</b> while placing {{stem cells from}} a second ram into the <b>testes</b> of the first, ram A. In the following weeks ram A produces semen the usual way, but is using the stem cells of ram B and therefore producing semen carrying the genetics of ram B rather than those of his own. Ram A therefore has effectively become a surrogate ram.|$|E

Um grupo de dez tenistas profissionais (GP) e um grupo de dez tenistas amadores (GA) foram submetidos a quatro sessões experimentais, a saber: 1) medidas antropométricas, familiarização com o <b>teste</b> de drop jump (DJ) e com o <b>teste</b> de contração voluntária isométrica máxima (CVIM) para membros inferiores, e um <b>teste</b> progressivo até a exaustão; 2) um <b>teste</b> de DJ e um <b>teste</b> de carga constante para avaliar a cinética on e off do consumo de oxigênio (VO 2); 3) um <b>teste</b> de CVIM para membros inferiores, outro <b>teste</b> de carga constante para avaliar a cinética on e off do VO 2 e familiarização com o <b>teste</b> de SR; 4) um <b>teste</b> composto por dez SR.

5|$|Adephaga {{contains}} about 10 families of largely predatory beetles, includes ground beetles (Carabidae), water beetles (Dytiscidae) and whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae). In these insects, the <b>testes</b> are tubular {{and the first}} abdominal sternum (a plate of the exoskeleton) is divided by the hind coxae (the basal joints of the beetle's legs).|$|E
5|$|Both sexes have genital slits on the {{underside}} of their bodies. The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit. The female's slit houses her vagina and anus. Females have two mammary slits, each housing one nipple, one {{on each side of the}} genital slit. The ability to stow their reproductive organs (especially in males) allows for maximum hydrodynamics. The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the <b>testes</b> enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large <b>testes</b> in relation to their body size.|$|E

5|$|Males have {{relatively}} small <b>testes</b> {{compared to other}} lemurs, and their canine teeth are {{the same size as}} those seen in females. During the dry season, females can weigh more than males. Both patterns of sexual dimorphism are consistent with the theory of sexual selection for monogamous species and female dominance respectively. Females have two pairs of nipples.|$|E
5|$|Other {{characteristics}} {{seen with}} the syndrome include developmental delay, growth retardation, pulmonary stenosis (an obstruction of blood-flow from the right ventricle of the heart to the pulmonary artery) with associated dyspnea (shortness of breath), and renal agenesis (failure of the kidneys to develop during the fetal period). Undescended <b>testes,</b> hyperactivity and aggressive behavior have also been noted.|$|E
5|$|Promiscuity, {{in which}} {{both males and females}} mate with {{multiple}} partners, also occurs in rodents. In species such as the white-footed mouse, females give birth to litters with multiple paternities. Promiscuity leads to increased sperm competition and males tend to have larger testicles. In the Cape ground squirrel, the male's <b>testes</b> can be 20 percent of its head-body length. Several rodent species have flexible mating systems that can vary between monogamy, polygyny and promiscuity.|$|E

5|$|Scent factors {{heavily into}} lemur reproduction. Scent-marking {{activity}} escalates during the mating season. Pheromones may coordinate reproductive timing for females coming into estrus. Mating {{can be either}} monogamous or promiscuous {{for both males and}} females, and mating can include individuals from outside the group. Monogamous lemurs include the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) and the mongoose lemur (E. mongoz), although the mongoose lemur has been observed mating outside of its pair bond. Monogamy is most common among nocturnal species, although some exhibit scramble competition, sexual suppression of subordinates, or competitions between males that avoid direct fighting. In mouse lemurs, males utilize sperm plugs, developed enlarged <b>testes</b> during the mating season, and develop size dimorphism (likely due to the enlarged <b>testes).</b> These indicate a mating system known as scramble competition polygyny, where males cannot defend females or the resources that might attract them.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s Antoine Lacassagne, using {{polonium}} provided by his colleague Marie Curie, showed that the element has a specific pattern of uptake in rabbit tissues, with high concentrations, particularly in liver, kidney, and <b>testes.</b> More recent evidence suggests that this behavior results from polonium substituting for its congener sulfur, also in group 16 of the periodic table, in sulfur-containing amino-acids or related molecules and that similar patterns of distribution occur in human tissues. Polonium is indeed an element naturally present in all humans, contributing appreciably to natural background dose, with wide geographical and cultural variations, and particularly high levels in arctic residents, for example.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, the warbler eats insects {{as well as}} berries, and {{the fruits}} of the {{introduced}} Spanish flag is a favourite where present. An increase in body mass occurs again before the northward migration, birds fattening even more rapidly than prior to their southward journey. Most internal organs (including the liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys and heart) and the flight muscles lose weight during the journey over the Sahara, although the <b>testes</b> quadruple in mass in preparation for the breeding season. Unlike drier-habitat species like the common whitethroat, they leave from savanna rather than the treeless Sahel further north.|$|E

5|$|In {{the male}} frog, the two <b>testes</b> are {{attached}} to the kidneys and semen passes into the kidneys through fine tubes called efferent ducts. It then travels on through the ureters, which are consequently known as urinogenital ducts. There is no penis, and sperm is ejected from the cloaca directly onto the eggs as the female lays them. The ovaries of the female frog are beside the kidneys and the eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through the cloaca to the exterior.|$|E
5|$|Male {{and female}} guinea pigs {{do not differ}} in {{external}} appearance apart from general size. The position of the anus {{is very close to}} the genitals in both sexes.

5|$|Nemerteans {{often have}} {{numerous}} temporary gonads (ovaries or <b>testes),</b> forming a row down {{each side of}} the body in the mesenchyme. Temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted), one per gonad, are built when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, some lay them in a burrow or tube, and some protect them by cocoons or gelatinous strings. Some bathypelagic (deep sea) species have internal fertilization, and some of these are viviparous, growing their embryos in the female's body.|$|E

5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the male}} and female in any particular species are adapted to fit each other like a lock (male) and key (female). In males, the ninth abdominal segment is divided into a dorsal 'tegumen' and ventral 'viniculum'. They form a ring-like structure for the attachment of genital parts and a pair of lateral clasping organs (claspers or 'harpe'). The male has a median tubular organ (called the aedeagus) which is extended through an eversible sheath (or 'vesica') to inseminate the female. The males have paired sperm ducts in all lepidopterans; the paired <b>testes</b> are separate in basal taxa and fused in advanced forms.|$|E
5|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} is {{considered}} overall sexually monomorphic, but seasonally fluctuating sexual dimorphism {{in terms of}} body mass has been recorded. While the body mass of both sexes fluctuates over the year {{as a function of}} food availability, being highest in the rainy season, the differing behavioral repertoires of the sexes lead to sex-specific patterns in this fluctuation. For example, male body mass increases prior to the mating season due to a substantial increase in <b>testes</b> volume that likely enhances the males' success in sperm competition.|$|E
5|$|Among harem-holding species, {{the adult}} females mate only with their harem stallion, while in other species, mating is more {{promiscuous}} and the males have larger <b>testes</b> for sperm competition. Estrous in female equines lasts 5–10 days; physical signs include frequent urination, flowing muscus, and a swollen, everted labia. In addition, estrous females will stand with their hind legs spread {{and raise their}} tails when {{in the presence of}} a male. Males assess the female's reproductive state with the flehmen response and the female will solicit mating by backing in. Length of gestation varies by species, it is roughly 11 to 13 months, and most mares will come into estrus again within a few days after foaling, depending on conditions. Usually, only a single foal is born, which is capable of running within an hour. Within a few weeks, foals will attempt to graze, but may continue to nurse for 8–13 months. Species in arid habitats, like the Grévy's zebra, have longer nursing intervals and do not drink water until they are three months old.|$|E
