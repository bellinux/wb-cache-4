Metcalfe told an Inside Soap reporter that this left Mercedes [...] "devastated" [...] as she has [...] "built up the courage to go through with it". Metcalfe went onto tease that <b>things</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> [...] "darker" [...] for her character. Mercedes became depressed and her sister Jacqui decided to help her. Mercedes attempted to seduce Jacqui's husband Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss), who told Jacqui. Cooper said Jacqui [...] "knows what state of mind" [...] Mercedes was in and [...] "lays into" [...] Mercedes, who revealed she has been working as a prostitute. Cooper explained Jacqui's reaction is [...] "pretty harsh" [...] and that she thought Mercedes was a [...] "promiscuous tart and a pathetic excuse for a woman" [...] with [...] "no morals". Cooper said Jacqui had [...] "given Mercedes chance after chance, and feels that she doesn't deserve anything more".|$|E
500|$|Paul Dini {{intended}} {{each of the}} flashbacks into Batman's {{love life}} to [...] "have a tendency to get worse, when you hope <b>things</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> better." [...] Bruce's relationship with Andrea, which at first shows promise, eventually turns into turmoil. At first, Bruce and Andrea are set for marriage, but then Bruce is given a farewell note from Andrea cutting off their relationship. This eventually leads into Bruce's decision to become Batman. Richard Corliss of Time felt this scene paralleled Andrea's decision to avenge her own parents and reject love, when she finds her own father murdered. Both events transform the two people (Bruce becomes Batman, Andrea becomes the Phantasm). One scene depicts Bruce Wayne at his parents' tombstone saying [...] "I didn't count on being happy." [...] According to Reaves, this scene {{was to be a}} pivotal moment in Bruce's tragic life, as he denies himself the opportunity to live a normal life. Reaves also stated: [...] "When Bruce puts on the mask for the first time, , and Alfred says 'My God!' he's reacting in horror, because he's watching this man he's helped raise from childhood, this man who has let the desire for vengeance and retribution consume his life, at last embrace the unspeakable." ...|$|E

However, you must give me until tomorrow." ...|$|R

It is unfortunate certainly, but <b>things</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> better in time. You can hardly expect to make the fugitives of a beaten army into heroes all at once. I have not the least doubt that if the Germans made an attack in full force they would meet with very slight resistance; but they won't do that. They will go to work in a regular and steady way. They will erect batteries, commanding every road out of the town, and will then sit down and starve us out, hastening the process, perhaps, by a bombardment. But all that will take time. There will be frequent fighting at the outposts, and if Trochu {{and the rest of them}} make the most of the material they have at hand, poor as much of it is, they will be able to turn out an army that should be strong enough to throw itself upon any point in the German line and break its way out; but it must be an army of soldiers, not a force composed of disheartened fugitives and half-drilled citizens." ...|$|E
