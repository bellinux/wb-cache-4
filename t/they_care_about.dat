Mobile beings are given higher protection than immobile ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses a being has, the more <b>they</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> non-injuring it.

2500|$|The Symposium is {{considered}} a dialogue – a form used by Plato in more than thirty works – {{but in fact it}} is predominantly a series of essay-like speeches from differing points of view.

[...] With dialogue, Socrates is renowned for his dialectic, which is his ability to ask questions that encourage others to think deeply about what <b>they</b> <b>care</b> <b>about,</b> and articulate their ideas. In the Symposium the dialectic exists among the speeches: in seeing how the ideas conflict from speech-to-speech, and in the effort to resolve the contradictions and see the philosophy that underlies them all.|$|E

For {{breaking}} the rules, the Prime Minister of Avalon (her brother Charon) exiles her, though the Chief Inspector (Fanta's brother Pain) offers parole if Medea helps Fanta deal with Ryang's evil affinities. Medea's recent plotting with rebels against the King of Avalon will probably end this deal. [...] Though she and Charon {{do not seem to}} always get along, <b>they</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> each great deal; Charon comforted her when she failed an exam miserably, partly from the pressure of having a brilliant faerie like Charon as a brother and the Prime Minister as her father, while Medea becomes visibly upset when Charon mysteriously disappears and agrees to help Pain find her brother and investigate the King of Avalon.|$|E

Rohan occasionally uses his younger sister Nikki for his personal gain, like when he uses her to make big tips while working for Kukkad Nukkad by saying that his mother was in the hospital when she actually worked there (customers just assumed she was ill). He dated Dolly's friend Maya, who like him is a scatterbrain, but they broke up in Rohan in the City, when Maya had to move to Mumbai because of her father's new job. He was originally intended to be named Rohan Singh, but Avatar was nervous as he was writing on his birth certificate, resulting in the legal name of [...] "Rohini Singh". Despite Avatar trying to correct this in the season two episode Can You Keep a Secret?, he accidentally changed the intended name to [...] "Rona Ping". In season three, Rohan moves into an apartment shared with Popi, but is still in the Singh house a lot. In Good Luck Charlie, Rohan is the equivalent of PJ Duncan who {{is played by}} Jason Dolley.|$|E
