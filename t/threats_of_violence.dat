5|$|The {{documentary}} proved controversial. Mainstream media reception was mixed, and it provoked particular {{criticism from}} figures within the United Kingdom's Islamic community, {{who argued that}} Holland ignored evidence supporting the orthodox account of early Islamic history. Government-approved regulatory authority Ofcom and the broadcaster Channel4 received an estimated 1200complaints regarding the program. Channel4 eventually cancelled a public screening of the documentary at their London headquarters after numerous <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some historians {{emphasize}} that the leagues were engaged in class struggle against a coalition of landowners and mafiosi and ignore evidence of strategic alliances between the Fasci and the Mafia. The leagues were not only led by socialists and anarchists; some were run by local gentry and mafiosi. The Mafia bosses Vito Cascioferro and Nunzio Giaimo led the Fasci in Bisacquino in alliance with Verro. The Mafia was sometimes needed to enforce flying pickets with credible <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> {{and to make the}} strike costly to landowners by destroying their property.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, {{a number}} of {{activities}} were proposed to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. A plan to hold a reenactment of the battle itself (as well as a reenactment of the subsequent French victory of 1760 at the Battle of Sainte-Foy) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder. Leaders of separatist parties described the event as {{a slap in the}} face for Quebecers of French ancestry and as an insult for the francophone majority. Some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats by stating that if the event took place, there could be violence. The movement against re-enactment and these <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> led the National Battlefields Commission to cancel the event.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} {{other areas of}} South Australia, and Australia as a whole, {{settlers}} on the frontier employed various tactics to deal with Aboriginal resistance to being forced off their traditional lands. Initially, these revolved around keeping them at a distance using <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> but they soon escalated to terrorising Aboriginal people to stop them interfering with stock and other property, tactics which sometimes included violent clashes. Violence by settlers towards Aboriginal people often went unreported to the authorities, and became more secretive after a settler was hanged in March 1847 for murdering an Aboriginal man in the south east of the colony, the only such sentence {{in the history of}} South Australia's early white settlement. This frontier violence has been described as an undeclared and covert war between settlers and Aboriginal people.|$|E
5|$|Free silver Democrats {{challenged}} Hunter's naturalization. It {{was finally}} concluded that Hunter, an Englishman, was naturalized under provisions {{of a federal}} law {{that allowed him to}} omit the standard preliminaries because of his service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army. Over the course of the contest, Hunter was also indicted for bribery, but was acquitted in short order for lack of evidence. Voting proceeded over several days, and demonstrators in the chamber galleries became disruptive in their support of various candidates. A Kentucky Post account from March 7, 1896, recorded that good-humored legislators began pelting each other with paper wads during the day's deliberations. This attempt at levity escalated until wrapped transcripts of the governor's message to the legislature were flying through the air. By March 11, tensions had reached the point that armed Democratic supporters were standing outside the state house in an attempt to intimidate Republican lawmakers and discourage them from entering. Attempts were made to unseat several legislators in the General Assembly, leading to <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b> Observers were banned from the gallery, and everyone entering the state house was searched for weapons.|$|E

5|$|Williamson {{and other}} members of Jamaica's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and {{transgender}} (LGBT) community decided to form an organisation to campaign for their rights, resulting in the establishment of the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All Sexuals, and Gays (J-FLAG) in December 1998. J-FLAG sought to enhance LGBT rights through advocacy and encouraging legal reform, as well as through educational and social service programs. They also kept a record of anti-LGBT hate crimes including assaults, home invasions, and the corrective rape of lesbians, further recording the murder of 30 gay men between 1997 and 2004. From the time of the group's foundation, its members were subjected to repeated death threats. Williamson became the public face of the group, appearing on radio talk shows and television shows such as Perspective and Nationwide in which he argued against homophobia and called for greater government investment to tackle the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Unlike most other LGBT rights activists in Jamaica, Williamson did not seek to protect himself by using a pseudonym, disguising his voice, or hiding his appearance. Facing hostility and <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> Williamson left Jamaica and moved to Canada and then England, before returning to the island in 2002. There, he moved into an apartment in his Haughton Street compound and decided to take a renewed role within Jamaica's LGBT rights movement. He lived in one room of his apartment block and rented out a number of others.|$|E
5|$|In March 1839, white {{settlers}} arrived from Adelaide, {{the capital of}} the colony of South Australia, to establish Port Lincoln on the east coast of the Eyre Peninsula. There were significant clashes between settlers and Aboriginal people in the years that followed, as settlers spread out to establish pastoral runs around the township. In 1842, soldiers were sent to Port Lincoln from Adelaide to help protect the settlers, but the remoteness from Adelaide, and the vaguely defined powers and limited policing resources of the Government Resident, the local representative of the colonial government, meant that there were serious limitations on the rule of law in the region. This was especially true with respect to Aboriginal people, who were supposed to be treated as British subjects {{in the same way as}} the settlers. In common with other areas of South Australia, and Australia as a whole, settlers on the frontier employed various tactics to deal with Aboriginal resistance to being forced off their traditional lands. Initially these revolved around keeping them at a distance using <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> but they soon escalated to terrorising Aboriginal people to stop them interfering with stock and other property, tactics which sometimes resulted in violent clashes. Violence by settlers towards Aboriginal people often went unreported to the authorities, and became more secretive after a settler was hanged in 1847 for murdering an Aboriginal man, the only such sentence in South Australia's pioneer history. This frontier violence has been described as an undeclared covert war between settlers and Aboriginal people.|$|E

25|$|The Sicilian Mafia in Italy is {{believed}} to have a turnover of €6.5 billion through control of public and private contracts.

25|$|The {{reaction}} of the Brazilian public was overwhelmingly negative.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1893, Corleone became the {{strategic}} center of the peasant movement and {{the epicenter of the}} strike wave, thanks to Verro’s charisma and to his hard-nosed choices, including a strategic alliance with a Mafia clan in Corleone and alliances with prominent Mafiosi in outlying towns, most notably Vito Cascioferro and Nunzio Giaimo in Bisacquino.

25|$|On May 12, 1902, the {{anthracite}} miners {{voting in}} Scranton, Pennsylvania, {{went out on}} strike. The maintenance employees, who had much steadier jobs and did not face the special dangers of underground work, walked out on June 2. The union {{had the support of}} roughly eighty percent of the workers in this area, or more than 100,000 strikers. Some 30,000 left the region, many headed for Midwestern bituminous mines; 10,000 men returned to Europe. The strike soon produced <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> between the strikers on one side and strikebreakers, the Pennsylvania National Guard, local police, and hired detective agencies on the other.|$|E
25|$|According to a Hindu American Foundation report, {{the rights}} and {{religious}} freedom of Kashmiri Hindus have been severely curtailed since 1989, when there was an organised and systematic campaign by Islamist militants to cleanse Hindus from Kashmir.

Sanjay Tickoo, who heads the KPSS, an organisation which looks after Pandits who remain in the Valley, says the situation is complex.
