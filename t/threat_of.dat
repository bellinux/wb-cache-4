5|$|Japan's {{rapid advance}} south had been unexpected, and the {{perceived}} <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> invasion led to a major expansion of the Australian military. By mid-1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions, three armoured divisions {{and hundreds of other}} units. Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps, which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively. However, Australia's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain these forces once the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> invasion had passed, and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} how social workers perceive and understand violence and <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> violence from clients, and how it effect their working environment. It seems that the respondents understand the violence and <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> violence from clients as a result of the clients background problems, vulnerability, dependency and from “the reason" that the client is currently in the contact with the organization. How respondents interpret the client´s behaviour based on the above-mentioned factors, seem to determine how the respondents perceive and define the violence and <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> violence by clients directed against them. Interestingly enough, although all respondents in the study experienced violence and <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> violence from clients, none of them perceived themselves as exposed at work.  The answer to this is consensual. The respondents argue that they “knew what they got into" and thus violence and <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> violence from clients can be considered as part of the work, that the social workers must be aware of in order to work within the organization.   A further aim of this study was to examine how the social workers views the matter of who’s responsible for the threats and violent incidents and how to "best" encounter the violence and <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> violence within the organization. The respondents argue that it is when the social workers communicate in a wrong way, use their power or give "bad decisions" to the clients that most threats and violent incidents occur. The role that the respondents construct for themselves can be understood as they need to,in their professional role "withstand a little bit" <b>of</b> violence and <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> violence from clients. The respondents then becomes mainly responsible for the threats and violent incidents, because they communicated in a wrong way, used the "unnecessary" exercise of power, or gave "bad decisions" to clients. The clients responsibility is then reduced due to the fact that the client merely reacts to how the respondent acted towards the client. The key element in the prevention of violence and <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> violence seems to be the way the respondents builds relations to the client.  However, it also appears that the respondents expect a certain amount of violence and <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> violence from clients. Violence and threats of violence therefore run the risk of becoming something that the respondents get used to and sometimes expect, and something that they to some extent can protect themselves from, but never fully avoid or prevent...|$|R
5|$|By 7:00a.m. Central Daylight Time, CAPE values began {{exceeding}} 4,000 j/kg, a {{level that}} climatologically favors the development of severe thunderstorms.

5|$|Due to {{the late}} 1950s-era <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs) that could threaten high-altitude aircraft, seen in practice in the 1960 U-2 incident, the intended use of B-52 was changed {{to serve as a}} low-level penetration bomber during a foreseen attack upon the Soviet Union, as terrain masking provided an effective method of avoiding radar and thus the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> the SAMs. Although never intended for the low level role, the B-52's flexibility allowed it to outlast several intended successors as the nature of aerial warfare changed. The B-52's large airframe enabled the addition of multiple design improvements, new equipment, and other adaptations over its service life.|$|E

In the face of the increasing <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> the Japanese Empire in the Pacific, he also put considerable effort into improving New Zealand's defences. After the Japanese entered the war, he considered the actual <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> invasion to be minimal but continued to encourage improvements in home defence as a means of boosting morale.|$|E
