5|$|Judah began boxing {{at the age}} of six and {{compiled}} {{an amateur}} record of 110–5. He was a two-time US national champion and three-time New York Golden Gloves Champion. He also won the 1996 PAL National Championship. Judah beat Ishe Smith and Hector Camacho, Jr., but lost to David Díaz in the finals of <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>trials,</b> thus failing to qualify for the Olympic boxing team.|$|E
5|$|On beam at the Visa Championships, Liukin {{scored a}} 15.1 on night one, {{followed}} by a 14.1 on night two to place sixth on the event. On bars, she placed 20th after scoring a 13.150 on night one and 13.650 on night two. Despite this, Liukin was chosen to compete at <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Trials.</b>|$|E
5|$|His {{performance}} at <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>trials</b> was in vain as Mr. Justice Mackay upheld the BOA ban in the High Court of Justice {{and stated that}} a right to work was not sufficient reason to remove it. The BOA chairman, Lord Moynihan, was satisfied with the outcome, stating that those abusing drugs did not deserve to represent Great Britain at the Olympics. However, he lamented that a sprinter of Chambers' calibre had in effect excluded himself from the competition.|$|E
50|$|Ansberry {{finished}} 7th in the 10000 meters at <b>the</b> 1984 <b>Olympic</b> <b>Trials</b> and 5th in the 10000 meters at <b>the</b> 1992 <b>Olympic</b> <b>Trials.</b>|$|R

25|$|Athletes {{qualified}} for <b>the</b> men's <b>Olympic</b> <b>Trials</b> by competing in preliminary tryouts. There were 14 preliminary meetings in total, including regional tryouts and major collegiate meets (the NCAA championship and the IC4A championship both served as tryouts). So many athletes {{qualified for}} <b>the</b> final <b>Olympic</b> <b>Trials</b> that {{three or more}} rounds were needed in all sprinting and hurdling events; for <b>the</b> next <b>Olympic</b> <b>Trials</b> in 1932 a more restrictive qualifying system was adopted. Athletes who {{finished in the top}} four in their events at the final <b>Trials</b> qualified for <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> team, with some exceptions. The marathon was not part of <b>the</b> main <b>Olympic</b> <b>Trials,</b> and a different qualifying system based on multiple races was used for that event.|$|R
5|$|In {{his final}} {{year as an}} amateur athlete, {{he spent much of}} early 2008 battling a {{hamstring}} injury. However, he returned in April to win his third 200m NCAA outdoor title, while placing fourth in the 100m. Although his personal bests rivalled those of top professional athletes, Dix decided to finish his degree in social science at FSU, as his graduation in May 2008 allowed him to focus on <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Trials</b> thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007–08 {{academic}} year, Sacramone {{continued to}} work with the Brown gymnastics team as a volunteer assistant coach. She remained a student at Brown, concentrated in sociology, but took the spring 2008 semester off to prepare for the Olympics. She competed well at the National Championships in Boston and <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Trials</b> in Philadelphia, and on July 19, she was named to the U.S. team for Beijing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1912, he started {{training}} for the Olympics. He had confined his efforts to jumps, hurdles and shot-puts, but now added pole vaulting, javelin, discus, hammer and 56lb weight. In <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>trials</b> held at Celtic Park in New York, his all-round ability stood out in all these events and so he riveted a claim to {{a place on the}} team that went to Sweden.|$|E
50|$|In {{his later}} career, Titus tried out for <b>the</b> 2012 <b>Olympic</b> <b>Trials,</b> coached <b>the</b> 2013 Deaflympic team, and is {{planning}} on returning {{to compete in}} <b>the</b> 2016 Rio <b>Olympic</b> <b>Trials.</b>|$|R
50|$|Until 1972 <b>the</b> Women's <b>Olympic</b> <b>Trials</b> {{were held}} separately. Also until 1972, <b>the</b> Men's <b>Olympic</b> <b>trials</b> {{conducted}} semi-final trials {{earlier in the}} season. Some events, including the Marathon and Racewalk frequently have separate <b>Olympic</b> <b>Trials.</b> <b>The</b> 1980 <b>Olympic</b> team was named but did not participate due to <b>the</b> 1980 <b>Olympic</b> Boycott declared by President Jimmy Carter.|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> 1992 <b>Olympic</b> <b>Trials,</b> Lakatos didn't make <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> team, {{finishing}} in 7th place.|$|R
5|$|Liukin {{was a key}} {{member of}} the U.S. senior team. She {{represented}} the United States at three World Championships and one Olympic Games. In October 2011, Liukin announced that she was returning to gymnastics with the hopes of making a second Olympic team. Liukin {{did not make the}} 2012 Olympic team, after several falls at <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Trials</b> and other pre-Olympic events, and retired from the sport in 2012.|$|E
5|$|While at Princeton, Harris {{excelled at}} intercollegiate athletics. Harris was a four-time NCAA Outdoor Track & Field All-American placing 7th, 5th, 4th and 1st in 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2002, respectively. He also was an NCAA Indoor All-American in 2002 when he placed 1st at the NCAA Championships. He did not {{participate}} in intercollegiate competition in 2000 in order to prepare for the 2000 United States Olympic trials. He failed to make the team after finishing seventh at <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>trials.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, Ohno would {{struggle}} at the 1997 World Championships in Nagano, Japan, finishing 19th overall. After this disappointing {{defeat at}} his first appearance at a world championships, Ohno returned home to Seattle. He did not train from April to August 1997, so he gained weight and was ill-prepared for the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics. As a result, he finished last in <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>trials</b> and did not qualify for the Olympic team. Because of his losses at the World Championships and his failure {{to qualify for the}} Olympic team, Ohno recommitted himself to the sport and returned to junior-level skating at Lake Placid, rather than at Colorado Springs.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Sacramone {{helped the}} U.S. win a team {{gold medal at}} the Pacific Alliance Championships in Honolulu and won the {{individual}} vault title. Her performances caught the attention of the media, which began to mention her as a contender for the American team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. However, at the 2004 U.S. Nationals, an error-filled performance dashed her hopes of an Olympic berth. Although she tied with Mohini Bhardwaj for the silver medal on the vault, she finished in 19th place overall and did not qualify to <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Trials.</b> She also injured her back and required time off to recover.|$|E
5|$|In the army, Nurmi quickly {{impressed}} in {{the athletic}} competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran the whole distances with a rifle {{on his shoulder and}} a backpack full of sand. Nurmi's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers, despite his refusal to take the soldier's oath. As the unit commander Hugo Österman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice. Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, holding on to the rear bumper, to stretch his stride, and used heavy iron-clad army boots to strengthen his legs. Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection. In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (alikersantti). On 29 May 1920, he set his first national record on the 3000 m and {{went on to win the}} 1500 m and the 5000 m at <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>trials</b> in July.|$|E
5|$|Martin's team {{directly}} {{qualified for}} the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials {{in his hometown of}} Edmonton. In his fourth Trials, Martin lost just one round robin game. After defeating the previously undefeated Glenn Howard rink in his final round robin game, Martin got a bye to the final, which was against Howard, whom he defeated 7–3. With the win, Martin earned the right to represent Canada for the second time at the Olympics. After <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Trials,</b> Martin's rink failed to qualify for the playoffs at the 2010 Swiss Chalet National. This would mark the first time Martin failed to make the playoffs at a Grand Slam since 2003. However, they proved they were worthy to represent Canada at the Olympics by winning the 2010 BDO Classic Canadian Open two weeks later.|$|E

5|$|Peters' show record {{before the}} 1992 Summer Olympics {{made him a}} hopeful {{to compete for the}} US team. However, his {{citizenship}} papers were not processed in time to compete in <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>trials,</b> and so he did not compete in Barcelona. Peters won his first Olympic medal when he rode with the US dressage team to a bronze medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, together with Robert Dover, Michelle Gibson and Guenter Seidel. Peters, riding Floriano, was an alternate for the US team at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and did not compete. In 2006, with an aging Floriano, Peters and the US team won bronze at the 2006 World Equestrian Games. Soon after, he began riding TC Ravel, who would become his most successful horse. Despite being gelded while in quarantine after his shipment from the Netherlands and suffering an injury in 2007 that prevented training, Ravel carried Peters to a qualification for the 2008 Summer Olympics. In individual dressage competition at the Games, Peters placed fourth, riding Ravel. The US team finished fourth at the 2008 Games, but was disqualified after team member Courtney King's horse tested positive for felbinac, a banned substance. In 2009, Peters and Ravel had the highest scores in all three portions of the prestigious German Aachen World Equestrian Festival Grand Prix competition, leading them to be the first American pair to be named the Aachen Grand Prix Champions.|$|E
