5|$|Chris Columbus—who {{had written}} the Spielberg-produced Gremlins, The Goonies, and Young Sherlock Holmes—was hired to write the script. His first draft, dated May 3, 1985, changed the main plot device to a Garden of Immortal Peaches. It begins in 1937, with Indiana battling the murderous ghost of Baron Seamus Seagrove III in Scotland. Indiana travels to Mozambique to aid Dr. Clare Clarke (a Katharine Hepburn type {{according}} to Lucas), who has found a 200-year-old pygmy. The pygmy is kidnapped by the Nazis during a boat chase, and Indiana, Clare and Scraggy Brier—an old friend of Indiana—travel up the Zambezi river to rescue him. Indiana is killed in the climactic battle but is resurrected by the Monkey King. Other characters include a cannibalistic African tribe; Nazi Sergeant Gutterbuhg, who has a mechanical arm; Betsy, a stowaway student who is suicidally in love with Indiana; and a pirate leader named Kezure (described as a Toshiro Mifune <b>type),</b> <b>who</b> dies eating a peach {{because he is not}} pure of heart.|$|E

Cunningham Dax described how he selected patients:"The operation was carried out with the primary object of relieving the most disturbed patients in the hospital quite independently of their poor prognosis.

Former Dodgers great Duke Snider acknowledged occasional run-ins with Alston, but he said that Alston excelled at utilizing the specific strengths of each team that he managed. Tommy Lasorda, who played and coached under Alston and ultimately succeeded him as manager, commented on {{how easy it was to}} play for Alston. Broadcaster Vin Scully said, [...] "I always imagined him to be the <b>type</b> <b>who</b> could ride shotgun on a stage through Indian territory. He was all man and two yards tall.

500|$|The {{region was}} {{originally}} settled by Kol people, an aboriginal {{people of the}} Austro-Asiatic physical <b>type</b> <b>who</b> were later joined by the Indo-Aryan Khasas tribe that arrived from the northwest by the Vedic period (1700–1100 BCE). At that time, present-day Uttarakhand {{also served as a}} habitat for Rishis and Sadhus. It is believed that the sage Vyasa scripted the Hindu epic Mahabharata in the state. Among the first major dynasties of Garhwal and Kumaon were the Kunindas in the 2nd century BCE who practised an early form of Shaivism and traded salt with Western Tibet. It is evident from the Ashokan edict at Kalsi in Western Garhwal that Buddhism made inroads in this region. Folk shamanic practices deviating from Hindu orthodoxy also persisted here. However, Garhwal and Kumaon were restored to nominal Hindu rule due to the travails of Shankaracharya and the arrival of migrants from the plains.|$|E
500|$|RZA sent several beats to West, {{including}} some that he cited as being edgy, {{because he felt}} that West was the <b>type</b> <b>who</b> could work well on more forceful production, including the brooding [...] "So Appalled". The song was nearly featured on Last Train to Paris, a studio album by Diddy. According to another producer on the song, No I.D., it was offered to both Jay-Z and Diddy before it leaked. West freestyled over the track for fun and found that he actually liked it enough to ultimately use it himself, stating {{that it would make}} a good group song. Cyhi the Prynce's verse only appeared on the song because he [...] "tricked" [...] West. Originally he was only supposed to deliver a quick hook, but at the time West was tired and let Cyhi record his verse alone. [...] When West awoke and played back the tape, he {{was surprised to find that}} Cyhi had recorded an entire verse. Impressed with it, West decided to include it on the track anyway. The song reportedly offended M.C. Hammer, who Jay-Z references on the line [...] "I spent another 30 / Cause unlike Hammer 30 million can't hurt me".|$|E
40|$|We look at {{a simple}} market with two-sided {{heterogeneity}} and pairwise meetings. On the supply side are two landlord <b>types</b> <b>who</b> differ {{in the quality of}} their apartments. On the demand side is a continuum of tentant <b>types</b> <b>who</b> differ in their valuations for apartment types and their patience. For infinitesimal search frictions and an atomless tanant type distribution, we full ycharacterize all possible steady stage equilibria in a typical region of the parameter space. Our main finding is that the heterogeneous discount factors can cause strong deviations from the Walrasian outcome even when we asymptotically remove all the search frictions. All conventional frictional models with non-Walrasian limits are qualitatively different from the model in this paper. ...|$|R

500|$|As a person, Kubrick was {{described}} by Norman Lloyd as [...] "a very dark, sort of a glowering <b>type</b> <b>who</b> was very serious". Marisa Berenson, who starred in Barry Lyndon fondly recalled: [...] "There was great tenderness in {{him and he was}} passionate about his work. What was striking was his enormous intelligence, but he also had a great sense of humor. He was a very shy person and self-protective, but he was filled with the thing that drove him twenty-four hours of the day." [...] Kubrick was particularly fond of machines and technical equipment, to the point that his wife Christiane once stated that [...] "Stanley would be happy with eight tape recorders and one pair of pants". Although Kubrick had obtained a pilot's license in August 1947, some have claimed that he later developed a fear of flying, stemming from an incident in the early 1950s when a colleague had been killed in a plane crash. Kubrick had been sent the charred remains of his camera and notebooks which, according to Duncan, traumatized him for life. Kubrick also had a strong mistrust of doctors and medicine, especially those he did not know, and on one occasion he had a dentist from the Bronx flown to London to treat him.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Popular Culture in Counseling, Psychotherapy, and Play-Based Interventions, Lawrence Rubin {{states that}} while Naruto has an optimistic and hyperactive personality, the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox (Kurama) within his body symbolizes his {{negative}} emotions. He comments that Naruto has a [...] attitude {{when dealing with}} intense conflicts and emotions. He also states that Naruto would use Kurama's chakra for battles he can not handle with his own chakra. Rubin further notes that the more Naruto uses Kurama's chakra, the more he puts his comrades and himself in danger. Rubin feels the reason Naruto is a troublemaker is because some villagers avoid him and others mistreat him. He states that children {{growing up in the}} real world who have development issues can relate to his character. Rubin states that the search for acceptance, and being acknowledged by his peers is what motivates Naruto to keep going until he reaches his life's goal, becoming the Hokage. Rubin feels that Naruto's fights with enemies who try to bring harm to the Leaf Village further motivate him to become a powerful shinobi, and a [...] "complete and mature person". Rubin concludes that Naruto's character development {{is similar to that of}} a modern American hero, the <b>type</b> <b>who</b> accidentally becomes better during a series and is able to build or restore peace.|$|E
