5|$|Queen Christina of Sweden's {{tendency}} to dress {{as a man}} was well known during her time, and excused because of her noble birth. She was brought up as a male and there was speculation at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a hermaphrodite. Even after Christina abdicated the throne in 1654 to avoid marriage, she was known to pursue romantic relationships with women.|$|E
5|$|Baeyertz {{was born}} as Emilia Louise Aronson on 29 March 1842 in Bangor, North Wales. Her family were wealthy {{orthodox}} Jews, {{and she was}} brought up to strict Jewish ideals. She attended school for a while but, by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> reached thirteen, her family removed her from formal education and she remained at home due to her ill health. Instead, she spent her time with her mother, who used to read Shakespeare to her, and would spend time in her family's library practising reading aloud.|$|E
5|$|Before he met Mrs. Jordan, William had {{an illegitimate}} son whose mother is unknown; the son, also called William, drowned off Madagascar in HMS Blenheim in February 1807.

5|$|She {{worked on}} several {{television}} series between 1993 and 2003 before joining The O.C.s writing staff, eventually leaving {{the show to}} write the 2006 film Step Up. From 2006 to 2009, she served as the head writer of the Showtime series Dexter, rising to executive producer by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> departed {{at the end of}} the fourth season. She wrote her second produced screenplay, a film adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's novel Twilight in 2007 and has since adapted the novel's three sequels, New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn.|$|E
5|$|From then on, Isabella used Castle Rising {{as one of}} {{her main}} residences until her death in 1358. Isabella was a wealthy woman, as the King granted her a yearly income of £3,000, which by 1337 had {{increased}} to £4,000. She enjoyed a regal lifestyle in Norfolk, maintaining minstrels, huntsmen and grooms, and received visits from Edward and the royal household on at least four occasions. Despite her large income, Isabella ran up long-standing debts with the local merchants near the castle. Around <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> took over the castle, a new set of buildings were constructed in the central bailey, including a west range containing a residential suite, a new private chapel, and a south range linking to various service buildings; the existing kitchen was reused. The great hall was reroofed, although Isabella lived in the west range, using the keep only for formal occasions or as accommodation for very senior guests. A brick wall around the outside of the inner bailey may have been built around this time to provide additional security.|$|E
5|$|Sharon Elizabeth Hall {{was born}} on November 30, 1939, in Independence, Missouri. When she was in junior high, Doris and Eugene Hall moved the family to Washington, {{but by the time}} Sharon was fifteen they had {{returned}} to Missouri, where Sharon attended William Chrisman High School. Sixteen-year-old Sharon met twenty-two-year-old college student James Kinne at a church function in the summer of 1956, and the couple dated regularly until Kinne returned to Brigham Young University in the fall. Sharon, reportedly deeply interested in finding a partner with prospects and who could take her away from Independence, soon wrote a letter to Kinne at school informing him that she was pregnant by him. Kinne took leave from his college and returned to Independence, where he married Sharon on October 18, 1956. The couple's marriage license identified sixteen-year-old Sharon as being eighteen and a widow; though she later refused to address the assertion, Sharon told people at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had been married when she lived in Washington, to a man who later died in a car accident. The new couple held a second, more formal wedding the next year in the Salt Lake Temple, after Sharon had completed the process of converting to Mormonism.|$|E

25|$|While it is {{generally}} accepted that Barnard was the more expressive writer of the two, and that Eldershaw contributed her acute critical sense, Rorabacher also states that in their early collaborative novels {{it is impossible to}} distinguish their separate contributions. Overall, Barnard did more of the creative writing while Eldershaw focused on the structure and development of their major works. However, because Eldershaw was the more outgoing and articulate of the two, it was frequently assumed, at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was the dominant partner. This did not spoil their partnership, which lasted two decades, bearing testament to the fact that both derived value from it.|$|E

25|$|Blavatsky {{taught that}} humans {{composed}} of three separate parts: a divine spark, an astral fluid body, {{and the physical}} body. Later Blavatsky proclaimed the septenary of Man and Universe. According to Blavatsky, man is composed of seven parts: Atma, Buddhi, Manas, Kama rupa, Linga sharira, Prana, and Sthula sharira. In Isis Unveiled, Blavatsky denied that humans would be reincarnated back on the Earth after physical death. However, by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had authored The Secret Doctrine, she had changed her opinion on this issue, likely influenced by her time in India. Here, she stated that the law of reincarnation was governed by karma, with humanity's final purpose being the emancipation of the soul from the cycle of death and rebirth. She believed that knowledge of karma would ensure that human beings lived according to moral principles, arguing that it provided a far greater basis for moral action that Christian doctrine.|$|E

Despite following her usual precautions, Linda became pregnant with the Director's son during their time together and was therefore unable to return to the World State by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> found her way to Malpais. Having been conditioned to the promiscuous social norms of the World State, Linda finds herself at once popular with every man in the pueblo (because she is open to all sexual advances) and also reviled for the same reason, seen as a whore by the wives of the men who visit her and by the men themselves (who come to her nonetheless). Linda is desperate to return to the World State and to soma, wanting nothing more from her remaining life than comfort until death.|$|E
25|$|The Maria Sharapova Foundation is {{committed}} to helping children around the world achieve their dreams. Sharapova has donated $100,000 to Chernobyl-related projects. In partnership with the UNDP, she launched a $210,000 scholarship program for students from Chernobyl-affected areas of Belarus that will award five-year scholarships to 12 students at the Belarusian State Academy of Arts and the Belarusian State University. At the 2004 US Open, Sharapova, along with several other Russian female tennis players, wore a black ribbon in observance of the tragedy after the Beslan school hostage crisis, which took place only days before. In 2005, she donated around US$50,000 to those affected by the crisis. On February 14, 2007, Sharapova was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and donated US$210,000 to UNDP Chernobyl-recovery projects. She stated at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was planning to travel back to the area after Wimbledon in 2008, though it didn't happen since she had to travel back to the US because of her shoulder injury. She fulfilled the trip in late June/early July 2010. Sharapova has helped to promote the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, {{and was the first}} torch bearer in the torch-lighting ceremony during the opening festivities. In addition, with Angela Haynes, Maria Kirilenko, Nicole Vaidišová, Rennae Stubbs, Governor Jeb Bush, and Jennifer Capriati, Sharapova participated in an exhibition in Tampa in December 2004, raising money for the Florida Hurricane Relief Fund. In July 2008, Sharapova sent a message on DVD to the memorial service of cancer victim Emily Bailes, who had performed the coin toss ahead of the 2004 Wimbledon final that Sharapova had gone on to win.|$|E

500|$|A {{biography}} of Sylvester was authored by Gamson {{and published in}} 2005. Writing for the London-based LGBT magazine Beige: The Provocative Cultural Quarterly, Stephen Brogan expressed his opinion that while Gamson's biography was well researched, it had a fragmented structure and as such was [...] "not a joy to read". Entertainment Weekly called the book [...] "playful and furious" [...] and awarded it a B+ rating, The Boston Globe suggested that it was [...] "as engaging as the times it so energetically resurrects", and The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the author [...] "carefully paints the shifting social tapestry into his subject's life story without ever taking Sylvester out of the foreground". The Fabulous Sylvester won the 2006 Stonewall Book Award for nonfiction. In 2015, Sylvester's publicist Sharon Davis published memoirs of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> spent with Sylvester, noting that she planned for it to appear in 2013 to mark the 25th anniversary of Sylvester's death.|$|E
500|$|Anna was married: Bede {{refers to}} the saint Sæthryth as [...] "daughter of the wife of Anna, king of the East Angles". In Abbott Folcard's Life of St Botolph, written in the 11th century, Botolph is {{described}} as having been at one time the chaplain to the sisters of a king, Æthelmund, whose mother was named Sæwara. Folcard names two of Sæwara's kinsmen as Æthelhere and Æthelwold. Since these are the names of two of Anna's brothers, Steven Plunkett {{suggests that it is}} [...] "tempting" [...] to consider that Sæwara was married to Anna, and that Æthelmund might either be Anna's full name, or the name of an otherwise unknown East Anglian sub-king. The Liber Eliensis names Hereswith, the sister of Hild, abbess of Whitby, as Anna's wife and the mother of Sæthryth, Seaxburh of Ely and Æthelthryth. [...] However, the Liber Eliensis is regarded with caution by historians: Rosalind Love says that the mediaeval writers who interpreted Bede's information about Hereswith made an [...] "erroneous assumption" [...] regarding her connection with Anna and his family. Historians now [...] believe that Hereswith was Anna's sister-in-law and that around <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> married into the East Anglian royal family, Anna had already been king for a decade.|$|E
500|$|In the Kentucky Oaks on May 3 at Churchill Downs, Beholder {{started at}} odds of 9–1 {{in a field}} of ten fillies, with the Gulfstream Oaks winner Dreaming of Julia the 6–4 favorite. [...] It {{was the first time she}} had been shipped outside of California. [...] Beholder tracked the leader, Midnight Lucky, before moving into the lead in the homestretch but was {{overtaken}} in the closing stages by the 39–1 outsider Princess of Sylmar and finished second, beaten by half a length. Her loss was attributed in part to her behavior in the post parade. Without her training earmuffs, she was anxious and upset by the crowd noise, fought to get away from the track pony that was leading her to the gate, and partially fell down, forcing Gomez to jump off. Sportswriters described her as [...] "angry" [...] and adrenaline-filled, while Mandella described her as [...] "rattled." [...] After the race, Gomez speculated that if Princess of Sylmar had been closer as she passed, instead of well to the outside, Beholder's fighting instincts still might have been enough to have held out for the victory. [...] However, he also commented at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> relied on speed to win, and if she was slowed down, she had difficulty regaining momentum.|$|E
