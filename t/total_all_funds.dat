5000|$|This brought {{consequences}} {{such as a}} large accumulated [...] "social debt" [...] (the sum tabulation {{of governmental}} neglect of a given area, such as the <b>total</b> of <b>all</b> <b>funds</b> {{that could have been}} spent on education, but instead were spent elsewhere), because the number of university matriculations stagnated, resulting in the exclusion of students originating from Venezuela's poorest sectors. Numerous studies agree that entrance to higher education predisposes students from any background to eventually earn greater incomes, both {{of the population of the}} cities and to students originating from elite private schools. On a par with this phenomenon, the tertiary education turning out official governmental managers reduced its participation in the education of private (corporate) management. From 1999, the National Government has dedicated efforts to strengthen the Venezuelan educational system, for which it has been indispensable to rescue the initiative of the State as a guarantor of high quality educational opportunities for all. With respect to the access to higher education, the National Government has achieved an expansion in matriculations to the Institutes and Schools and in good part to the Experimental National Universities, in a joint work with the authorities and the established communities of these institutions.|$|R

40|$|Upon {{accession}} to the European Union, the New Member State’s budget undergoes significant structural changes {{due to the}} appearance of new categories of revenues and expenditures. The aim {{of this paper is}} to estimate the possible effects of Croatian membership in the EU on changes in the structure and size of budget revenues and expenditures upon the country’s {{accession to}} the EU in the second half of 2013, as well as to indicate the possibilities for utilization of EU funds in the new financial perspective up to 2020. It is shown that in 2013 Croatia might realize a positive net financial position in transactions with the EU budget in the amount of approximately 0. 28 % of GDP, i. e. EUR 136 m. The total net financial position of Croatia due to EU accession, which includes some additional costs and benefits like different harmonization and the need for project co-financing at state and local levels, is also positive in 2013 and amounts to approximately 0. 15 % of GDP or equivalently EUR 72 m. <b>Total</b> amount of <b>all</b> <b>funds</b> that Croatia might receive in the new EU financial perspective covering the period from 2014 to 2020 amounts to EUR 6. 34 bn, whereby annual amounts increase from EUR 0. 7 bn in 2014 up to EUR 1. 2 bn in 2020. By using exponential regression analysis it is estimated that in 2020 Croatia should be a net recipient of funds from the EU budget in total amount of 1. 72 % of GDP, i. e. EUR 1. 13 bn...|$|R
