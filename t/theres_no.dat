A birthday party while everybody around him is starving and dying. <b>There's</b> <b>no</b> electricity, <b>there</b> are <b>no</b> roads, <b>there</b> are <b>no</b> jobs, <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> education, <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> medical, <b>there's</b> nothing.

5000|$|... "What is self? What {{lies beyond}} self? Self is the {{perception}} of perception. Beyond self <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> perception of perception. That's the riddle. The only way to answer the riddle is to go beyond perception and, of course, then <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> answer because <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> perception, <b>there's</b> only silence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> joy without danger"--Mrs. Brook took {{it up with}} spirit. [...] "Perhaps {{one should}} even say <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> danger without joy." ...|$|R
60|$|TANNER. But-- [he stops, utterly appalled; then resumes feebly] No: look here, Ann: if <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> harm in it <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> {{point in}} doing it.|$|R
60|$|JUGGINS. I assure you, sir, <b>theres</b> <b>no</b> {{correct way}} of jilting. It's not correct in itself.|$|E

5000|$|<b>There's</b> <b>no</b> {{economic}} model that justifies {{setting up a}} support team to support just five planes in the field. <b>There's</b> <b>no</b> critical mass to make it economically viable.|$|R
60|$|MRS. FARRELL. <b>Theres</b> <b>no</b> music halls nowadays: theyre Variety Theatres. Shes got {{an offer}} of {{marriage}} from a young jook.|$|E
60|$|THE SECRETARY. Oh, {{they wont}} come again: <b>theres</b> <b>no</b> lunch to-day. The advance copies {{of your book}} have come. [He {{indicates}} the new books].|$|E
6000|$|CROFTS. As to that, <b>theres</b> <b>no</b> {{resemblance}} {{between her and}} her mother that I can see. I suppose she's not y o u r daughter, is she? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But is <b>there</b> <b>no</b> redress {{for such}} iniquitous oppression," [...] said Morley, who had listened with astonishment to this complacent statement. [...] "Is <b>there</b> <b>no</b> {{magistrate}} to apply to?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{wish you}} would,' {{answered}} Susie, 'because he interests me enormously. <b>There's</b> <b>no</b> place like Paris for meeting queer folk. Sooner or later you run across persons {{who believe in}} everything. <b>There's</b> <b>no</b> form of religion, <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> eccentricity or enormity, that hasn't its votaries. Just think what a privilege it is to come upon {{a man in the}} twentieth century who honestly believes in the occult.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Afterwards, {{a police}} {{sergeant}} {{said that the}} main street in Marysville had been destroyed: [...] "The motel {{at one end of}} it partially exists. The bakery has survived. Don't ask me how. Everything else is just nuked." [...] Reports on 11 February estimated that around 100 of the town's population of approximately 500 had believed to have perished, and that only [...] "a dozen" [...] buildings were left. Premier Brumby described the situation: [...] "There's <b>no</b> activity, <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> people, <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> buildings, <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> birds, <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> animals, everything's just gone. So the fatality rate will be very high." ...|$|R
2500|$|Regarding his {{religious}} beliefs, Carolla has stated, [...] "I am not agnostic. I am atheist. I don't think <b>there</b> is <b>no</b> God; I know <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> God. I know <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> God {{the same way}} I know many other laws in our universe. I know <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> God and I know {{most of the world}} knows that as well. They just won't admit it because there's another thing they know: they know they're going to die, and it freaks them out. So most people don't have the courage to admit <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> God and they know it. They feel it. They try to suppress it. And if you bring it up they get angry because it freaks them out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not wanting}} to fight," [...] said Peter. [...] "It's Felix. If he don't {{interfere}} with my prayers <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> need of fighting. But if he does <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> other way to settle it." ...|$|R
60|$|BALSQUITH (ambling calmly to the hearth). This is the {{business}} of the Sergeant at Arms rather than of the leader of the House. <b>Theres</b> <b>no</b> use in my tackling Mrs. Banger: she would only sit on my head too.|$|E
60|$|MRS KNOX. [interrupting him] <b>Theres</b> <b>no</b> use {{going over}} it all again, Jo. If a girl hasnt {{happiness}} in herself, she wont be happy anywhere. Youd better {{go back to}} the shop and try to keep your mind off it.|$|E
60|$|DORA. Oh, aint we impatient! Well, it does you credit, old dear. And you neednt fuss: <b>theres</b> <b>no</b> disgrace. Bobby {{behaved like}} a perfect gentleman. Besides, it was all my fault. I'll own it: I took too much champagne. I was not {{what you might call}} drunk; but I was bright, and a little beyond myself; and--I'll confess it--I wanted to shew off before Bobby, because he was a bit taken by a woman on the stage; and she was pretending to be game for anything. You see youve brought Bobby up too strict; and when he gets loose <b>theres</b> <b>no</b> holding him. He does enjoy life more than any lad I ever met.|$|E
5000|$|... “While <b>there</b> are <b>no</b> {{shortage}} of design awards, {{we wanted to}} do it differently: not just a big dinner that everyone has to buy tables for,” says Festival Director Ben Evans. “So we took the Nobel Prize route - <b>there’s</b> <b>no</b> shortlist, just a winner. So that means <b>there’s</b> <b>no</b> losers either.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Archer {{went back}} to his home town of Staines, [...] "I moved back to Staines because I ran out of money and it was quite a shock," [...] he says. [...] "There's <b>no</b> record shops, <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> decent pubs, <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> venues, <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> decent clothes shops. Look around, it's quite {{pleasant}} but if you're a young person living here then you're into a certain type of music - chart house - and a certain fashion, and if you're not into that there is nothing here for you. Here, you can't get home if you're out in central London after eleven. <b>There's</b> <b>no</b> night bus, <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> late train, you have to get a cab if you can find one and that'll charge you eighty quid to get home from central London. A lot of people live like that." ...|$|R
