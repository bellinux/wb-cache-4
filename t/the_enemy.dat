5|$|Combat in Mother 3 {{includes}} a unique musical combo system {{not seen in}} previous Mother games. When one of the player's characters directly attacks an enemy with a weapon, they can repeatedly attack <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> by pressing the button {{in time with the}} beat of the background music, with each enemy possessing a musical theme with different rhythms. Using this system, the player can attack <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> up to sixteen times in a row. When the correct beat is not apparent, the player can put <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> to sleep to isolate the beat from the music.|$|E
5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} Chain Gauge, {{consisting}} of a percentage that increases from a base level of 100 when <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> is struck by attacks or spells. Different attacks have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the Chain Gauge resets to 100 percent. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it is applied to <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> becomes Staggered. In this mode, <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> has lowered defense and is easily interrupted, and some may even be launched into the air, preventing them from attacking and stopping their ATB gauges from replenishing.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the war, her encounters with <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> were infrequent. In fact, her next submarine contact did not occur until 17December and, like those before, resulted in no definite damage to <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> Although the opening months of 1918 brought no new U-boat contacts, Wadsworth worked hard escorting convoys and patrolling British waters.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to targeting <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> command and control, information warfare can {{be directed to}} <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> politicians and other civilian communications.|$|R

6000|$|... “Five: In {{order to}} capture <b>the</b> <b>enemy’s</b> ships, and {{confiscate}} <b>the</b> <b>enemy’s</b> merchandise and {{contraband of war}} under whatever form, the auxiliary cruisers will exercise the right of search on the high seas, and in the waters under <b>the</b> <b>enemy’s</b> jurisdiction, in accordance with international law and the regulations which will be published.|$|R
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{was given a}} {{customizable}} ship named the Nemesis, commanded by Sterling and his crew. The player's choices in the game would determine the crew they could hire, which in turn affected the ship's attributes. The vessel {{could be used to}} explore the Caribbean Sea and battle other crafts. During combat, the player could maneuver the ship, fire the cannons, or board <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> vessel for hand-to-hand combat. If <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> craft was boarded and <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> crew was eliminated, the player received more loot than if it was destroyed. Loot salvaged in these battles could be sold in markets.|$|E
5|$|In the legion, the velites were {{attached}} to each maniple of hastati, principes and triarii. They usually formed up {{at the front of}} the legion before battle to harass <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> with javelin throws and to prevent <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> doing the same before retiring behind the lines to allow the heavier infantry to attack. After they had fallen back, they would move up behind the attacking troops and throw darts at <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> They also sometimes carried wounded back to the rear, however usually a corps of deportates did this. In a pitched battle, the velites would form up {{at the front of the}} legion and cover the advance of the hastati, who were armed with swords. If the hastati failed to break <b>the</b> <b>enemy,</b> they would fall back and let the principes, similarly equipped though more experienced infantry, take over. If the principes failed, they would retire behind the triarii, well trained, heavily armoured, spear armed legionaries and let them attack.|$|E
5|$|On 10 April 1918, at El Kefr, Egypt, {{during an}} attack, Rifleman Karanbahadur Rana {{and a few}} other men crept forward with a Lewis gun under intense fire to engage an enemy machine-gun. No. 1 of the Lewis gun team opened fire but was shot almost immediately, whereupon the rifleman pushed the dead man off the gun, opened fire, knocked out <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> gun crew and then silenced the fire of <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> bombers and riflemen in front of him. During the {{remainder}} of the day he did magnificent work and finally assisted with covering fire in the withdrawal, until <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> were close on him.|$|E
50|$|This mode is {{very similar}} to the pencil and paper game, Battleship, however, there is a storyline to it. The storyline follows the player {{destroying}} <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> fleet on <b>the</b> first two levels and then proceeding to <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> headquarters on <b>the</b> third level. On the third level, <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> vessels are replaced with a large runway and tanks.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} {{political}} warfare {{can be traced}} to antiquity. The Chinese general and strategist Sun Tzu captures its essence in the ancient Chinese military strategy book, The Art of War: [...] "So to win a hundred victories in a hundred battles is not the highest excellence; the highest excellence is to subdue <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> army without fighting at all...The expert in using the military subdues <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> forces without going to battle, takes <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> walled cities without launching an attack, and crushes <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> state without protracted war." ...|$|R
50|$|The Islamic Curriculum draws heavily {{upon the}} Quranic verses {{and traditions of}} the Prophet to expose ISIS and other militant groups who have {{absolutely}} no authority or legitimacy for setting up an Islamic State. According to the curriculum, ISIS and other militant groups {{have nothing to do}} with Islam and Islam also curses those people who kill the innocent with no reason. Fatwa on Terrorism, also written by Dr. Tahir ul Qadri, has declared these militant group criminals, <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> of humanity, <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> of religion, <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> of morality, <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> of human values.|$|R
5|$|On 10, 12 and 13 April, {{the lines}} {{held by the}} 104th Infantry in Bois Brule (near Apremont), and by the French to the left, were heavily {{attacked}} by the Germans. At first <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> secured a foothold in some advanced trenches which were not strongly held, but sturdy counterattacks succeeded in driving <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> out with serious losses, and the line was entirely re-established.|$|E
5|$|Once the fleets {{were close}} enough, exchanges of {{missiles}} began, ranging from combustible projectiles to arrows and javelins. The aim {{was not to}} sink ships, but to deplete the ranks of <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> crews before the boarding actions, which decided the outcome. Once <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> strength was judged to have been reduced sufficiently, the fleets closed in, the ships grappled each other, and the marines and upper bank oarsmen boarded <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> vessel and engaged in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
5|$|One soon {{latched onto}} him and began firing. McCudden dived steeply but <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> pilot {{remained}} behind him. At 800 feet McCudden began a spinning dive until the German, now some distance behind, abruptly turned away. <b>The</b> <b>enemy</b> aircraft was fired at by British ground forces and McCudden, who by now had unjammed his Lewis machine gun, turned to give pursuit. <b>The</b> <b>enemy</b> pilot, apparently unaware of this, {{was already too}} high and McCudden watched as he re-joined his flight and departed the area.|$|E
5000|$|This {{claim by}} <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> created a chaos and doubt {{in the minds}} of some {{of the members of the}} community. However to all these claims by <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> he did not say a word. He just kept on {{performing}} his activities as a Da'i al-Mutlaq as if nothing had happened. But <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> tried very hard to make him say something against them but his patience and complacancy was hard to break. This silence by him broke the backbone of the contention of <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> as it had a two pronged effect: ...|$|R

5|$|One {{striking}} {{difference was}} that late army doctrine (and practice) aimed at avoiding open battle with <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> if possible, unlike the early doctrine from the Principate of seeking to bring <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> to battle as often and as quickly as possible. The main motivation was likely not a reduced ability to win such encounters. The late army continued to win {{the great majority of}} its battles with barbarians. Rather, the primary concern seemed to be the need to minimise casualties. Pitched battles generally resulted in heavy losses of high-grade comitatenses troops, which could not be easily replaced. This in turn supports the hypothesis that the late army had greater difficulty than the Principate in finding sufficient recruits, and especially high-quality recruits. The late army preferred to attack <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> by stealth or stratagem: ambushes, surprise attacks, harassment and manoeuvres to corner <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> in zones where they could not access supplies and from which they could not escape (e.g. by blocking mountain passes or river crossings).|$|E
5|$|Pitched battles were {{conducted}} in a similar fashion: the velites would gather at the front and fling javelins to cover the advance of the hastati. If the hastati failed to break <b>the</b> <b>enemy,</b> they would fall back on the principes, who along with the hastati, had been re-equipped with pila rather than spears. If the principes could not break <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> they would retire behind the triarii, who would then engage <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plan Tortue was a delaying {{operation}} aimed at <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> forces that would potentially reinforce Axis forces at Normandy.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>enemies</b> in Enter Electro {{are more}} {{realistic}} {{than the ones}} in the previous game, such as criminals, lizardmen and alien symbiotes. In the second game all <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> are criminals and robots.|$|R
2500|$|... "Twice charged through <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> lines and, {{taking a}} carbine from an enlisted man, shot <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> captain." [...] Captain John Quincy Marr {{was the first}} Confederate soldier killed in combat during the Civil War.|$|R
50|$|The player remains {{stationary}} in {{the middle}} of the map and is equipped with a shotgun. As <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> make their way towards the player there is a word hovering over them. In order to shoot at <b>the</b> specific <b>enemy</b> <b>the</b> player needs to type out the word and press Enter. The longer the player survives the longer the words that appear over <b>the</b> <b>enemies.</b>|$|R
5|$|Still {{in pursuit}} of the debris of <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> force, late on 13 February, Napoleon {{received}} reports that Marmont's Corps had been attacked and pushed out of his position at Étoges. The Emperor deduced that <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> force before him {{would have to be a}} much reduced one and promptly decided to go to Marmont's aid. The Emperor left Château-Thierry on 14 February, towards 3 o'clock in the morning, leaving a small portion of his forces with Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise, with orders to continue the pursuit of <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> Taking with him the cavalry of the Guard and Grouchy's Cavalry Reserve, Napoleon headed for the village of Vauchamps.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus and Diodorus, the king, {{having taken}} {{the measure of}} <b>the</b> <b>enemy,</b> threw his best troops into a second assault the same day, the Immortals, an elite corps of 10,000 men. However, the Immortals fared {{no better than the}} Medes, and failed to make any headway against the Greeks. The Spartans {{apparently}} used a tactic of feigning retreat, and then turning and killing <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> troops when they ran after them.|$|E
5|$|After Christmas 1914, {{sporadic}} {{attempts were}} made at seasonal truces; a German unit attempted to leave their trenches under a flag of truce on Easter Sunday 1915, but were warned off by the British opposite them, {{and later in the}} year, in November, a Saxon unit briefly fraternised with a Liverpool battalion. In December 1915, there were explicit orders by the Allied commanders to forestall any repeat of the previous Christmas truce. Individual units were encouraged to mount raids and harass <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> line, whilst communicating with <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> was discouraged by artillery barrages along the front line throughout the day. The prohibition was not completely effective, however, and a small number of brief truces occurred.|$|E
50|$|All of <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> in <b>the</b> game, {{including}} the slime drops, can be destroyed by triggering a wedge on them. Since the wedges appear slowly and <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> move fairly rapidly, {{this is not}} an easy task.|$|R

25|$|The goal of {{the player}} in Black Hole Rising, common {{to all of the}} Nintendo Wars series, is to defeat all of <b>the</b> <b>enemies,</b> {{sometimes}} by completing special objectives. Generally, the player can win by defeating all of <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> troops, or by capturing <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> headquarters. In certain campaign maps, there are special objectives, such as capturing or destroying certain key buildings, such as a Black Cannon, a new property found in Black Hole Rising.|$|R

5|$|As Khalid was the {{architect}} {{of most of the}} early Muslim military doctrines, he was also the pioneer of almost every major tactic that Muslims used during Early Islamic conquests. One of Khalid's major achievements in this context was utilizing the individual skills of Arab Bedouin warriors to a larger scale. He is believed to have developed them into an almost regular unit called Mubarizun ("champions"), who would issue personal challenges to <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> officers. These were highly trained and skilled swordsmen, whom Khalid utilized effectively to slay as many enemy officers as possible, giving a psychological blow to enemy morale. The Battle of Ajnadayn is perhaps the best example of this form of psychological warfare. Moreover, his biggest achievement was the conversion of Arab tactical doctrine into a strategic system. Until Khalid, the Arabs were basically raiders and skirmishers. Khalid turned those skirmishing tactics into something that could be used anywhere. Thus he would skirmish <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> to death: he would bring his army in front of his enemies and wait until the whole battle degenerated into a skirmishing affair between small units. Then, after exhausting <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> units, he would launch his cavalry at their flanks employing Hammer and Anvil tactics.|$|E
5|$|At 09:24 on {{the morning}} of 1 June, Howe sent his ships into action using the {{original}} tactic of turning each ship in his line northwest simultaneously, so that they would bear down individually on Villaret's fleet and each break <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> line separately. His intention was to cut the French line in 25 places, raking <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> vessels at both bow and stern and dividing their fire so they could be defeated piecemeal. Ultimately though this ambitious plan failed, due to ill-discipline among Howe's subordinates and the damage his fleet had sustained over the previous week. While six of Howe's ships did break the French line as ordered, and several others came close, many of his captains failed to follow orders and instead engaged <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> from a distance in desultory gun duels which had little effect.|$|E
50|$|In single player, {{the main}} {{objective}} is to defeat <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> that lurk in the cave and find the exit when done. There are two modes that can be selected before each new stage; Mode A, which requires the player to simply destroy all <b>the</b> <b>enemies,</b> and Mode B, which requires the player to defeat <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> in a certain order. When an area is cleared, the player earns a new ability to help them in later levels.|$|R
