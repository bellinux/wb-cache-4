On March 9, a solar eclipse in China, Mongolia and eastern Siberia allowed observers there to see the comet in the daytime. Hale–Bopp had its closest approach to Earth on March 22, 1997 {{at a distance of}} 1.315AU.|$|E
5|$|Several of the show's filming {{sets were}} changed between episodes. The Psych office was {{expanded}} and refurnished, afterwards becoming {{the second largest}} stage for the show. The house for Henry Spencer was changed, {{in order to be}} closer to the ocean. The set for Chief Vick's office was also changed, and was repainted <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> the scenes shot in it. Much of the episode was filmed on a sound stage, while several other scenes were filmed {{in the basement of the}} facility. Much of the installment was written to take place in Santa Barbara's Arlington Theater. Several of the episode's scenes were written by Franks while filming the pilot episode.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways held {{a celebration}} in 2009 {{to mark the}} increase in passenger numbers. They were joined by pupils from Parson Street Primary School who had provided artwork <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> up the station. This was done {{as part of the}} Severnside Schools Community Stations Programme, organised by the Severnside Community Rail Partnership. The Severnside CRP also installed plant displays in 2008, and in 2011 distributed leaflets advertising train services to local residents, in association with Bristol City Council and Passenger Focus. In January 2017 a group called Friends of Parson Street Railway Station was formed to lobby for improvements to facilities and services at the station.|$|E

5|$|The game {{needed a}} 32 megabit battery backed-up {{cartridge}} to work properly, and was expensive to produce. This factor deterred some publishers, alongside {{the fact that}} launching a new intellectual property was considered risky. WayForward {{tried to find a}} publisher for years, before Capcom eventually picked the game for release. Capcom, however, held back the release for months, during which the Game Boy Advance was released. It is rumored that the game had only one run of 20–25,000 copies. WayForward saw that the console's screen had a tendency to darken the colours, so they took back the game and made further developments on it, incorporating a feature <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> the screen if played on a Game Boy Advance, alongside some bonus features.|$|E
5|$|The offer, {{representing}} a 46 percent premium over the stocks selling price at the time, {{came as a}} surprise to Burger King CEO John Chidsey. The proposed sale was expected to help the company repair its fundamental business structures and continue working to close the gap with McDonald's. Analysts commenting on the transaction stated that 3G will have to invest heavily in the company to help reverse its fortunes. David Palmer from UBS stated the company will need to work with its large group of franchise owners <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> its locations and stabilize sales which could take several years and require significant reinvestment, while Steve West of Stifel Nicolaus stated that Burger King will need at least a year to right its fundamentals.|$|E
5|$|At Tabata's suggestion, Naora {{expanded}} the color palette {{to increase the}} game's realism and tie in with XVs art style. The original idea was to change the original red hue to a golden one to match the redone logo, but the graphics looked too dark on the large screen even with the adjustment, so blue tones were added <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> up the scenery. Additional bass sounds {{were added to the}} sound effects, as the original platform's speaker system had previously limited the range and strength of sounds. The original camera behavior needed to be developed from scratch, as the camera angles used in the original looked out of place on the large screen. During the run-up to release, the team made modifications to the camera after receiving negative comments during demonstrations, addressing scenery collisions and the visibility of player and enemy characters during active gameplay. Because of these modifications, character speed and movement could be increased and improved. By December 2014, the game was in its final stages of development and undergoing debugging.|$|E
40|$|Photometric {{observations}} of Venus during 1970 inferior conjunction, {{in contrast to}} observations made during the 1969 inferior conjunction, show {{no evidence of a}} Venus halo effect at 158 phase angle. The upper limit <b>to</b> <b>brightening</b> is about 0. 005 mag but can still be reconciled with earlier results. Because {{of the importance of the}} question of H 2 O-ice in the Venus clouds, further observations are encouraged to remove the marginality of most observations to date...|$|R

Weak radial darkening was seen at all four wavelengths near disk center. This reverses <b>to</b> <b>brightening</b> toward the limb in the 100 and 200 micron continuum. Radial darkening at 100 and 200 microns is not expected from smooth model chromospheres consistent with absolute brightness measurements. These results do not support a homogeneous model of the low chromosphere, where the temperature reversal occurs...|$|R

50|$|The Color Kids spread color {{across the}} {{universe}} from the Color Console inside the Color Castle. Each Color Kid {{is in charge of}} their respective color, has a personal sprite and manages a number of like-colored sprites that mine Color Crystals from the nearby Color Caves. These crystals are processed into Star Sprinkles which are the essential components <b>to</b> <b>brightening</b> and coloring any object or place. Rainbow Brite and the Color Kids' mission is often complicated by the likes of Murky Dismal, his sidekick Lurky, and other villains. Brian, a boy from Earth, sometimes assisted Rainbow Brite in her adventures.|$|R
25|$|From 1931 to 1934, Higson was {{a member}} of the Selection Committee, with Sir Pelham Warner and P. A. Perrin. He helped to choose the M.C.C. side which visited Australia in 1932–33 for the {{controversial}} bodyline tour. On this, his view was that such bowling was detrimental to cricket. He had strong views on many aspects of the game and in 1934 argued for two-day single innings county matches <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> the game.|$|E
25|$|Linked to {{the theme}} of God's {{creation}} is God's Order. The God of Genesis, who put the sun <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> the day and the moon for the night also caused the stars to shift overhead in a particular pattern which coincided with the changing seasons and could be seen as God's guidance as to when sowing and harvesting was to take place. The ancient identities of the Zodiacal signs continued in use and were often depicted in small carvings, particularly around arched doorways, and also in stained glass where, because the pattern is cyclic, they were particularly suited to small panels in rose windows.|$|E
25|$|The spiral and helical scan systems {{produced}} {{very different}} displays {{from the same}} basic data. With the helical-scan system, the radar dish was moving horizontally, producing a series of stripes across the screen while scanning up and down so subsequent lines were above or below the last pass. This created a raster scan display, not unlike a television. Echoes caused the signal <b>to</b> <b>brighten,</b> producing a spot, or blip on the display. The blip's location indicated the direction to the target relative {{the nose of the}} fighter, represented by the centre point of the display. The further the blip was from the centre of the screen, the further away the target was from the centreline. The range was not directly indicated in this sort of display.|$|E
60|$|The said fog {{prevented}} any {{semblance of}} sunset; {{but through the}} gray moonlit haze, Leonard kept {{his face to the}} window, pertinaciously clearing openings in the bedewed glass, as though the varying outline of the horizon had a fascination for him. At last, after ten minutes of glaring gas at a junction had by contrast rendered the mist impenetrable, and reduced the view <b>to</b> <b>brightened</b> clouds of steam, and to white telegraphic posts, erecting themselves every moment, with their wires changing their perspective in incessant monotony, he ceased his gaze, and sat upright in his place, with the same strange rigid somnambulist air.|$|R

25|$|This cave (35.7 m x 27.6 m) {{has one of}} {{the most}} {{elaborate}} carved façades, with relief sculptures on entablature and ridges, and most surfaces embellished with decorative carving. There are scenes carved from the life of the Buddha as well as a number of decorative motifs. A two pillared portico, visible in the 19th-century photographs, has since perished. The cave has a front-court with cells fronted by pillared vestibules on either side. These have a high plinth level. The cave has a porch with simple cells on both ends. The absence of pillared vestibules on the ends suggests that the porch was not excavated in the latest phase of Ajanta when pillared vestibules had become a norm. Most areas of the porch were once covered with murals, of which many fragments remain, especially on the ceiling. There are three doorways: a central doorway and two side doorways. Two square windows were carved between the doorways <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> the interiors.|$|E
25|$|Jewelry {{was also}} popular {{among those that}} could afford it. Necklaces were beaded gold or silver chains and worn in {{concentric}} circles reaching as far down as the waist. Ruffs also had a jewelry attachment such as glass beads, embroidery, gems, brooches or flowers. Belts were a surprising necessity: used either for fashion or more practical purposes. Lower classes wore them almost as tool belts with the upper classes using them as another place to add jewels and gems alike. Scarves, although not often mentioned, {{had a significant impact}} on the Elizabethan style by being a multipurpose piece of clothing. They could be worn on the head to protect desirable pale skin from the sun, warm the neck on a colder day, and accentuate the colour scheme of a gown or whole outfit. The upper class had silken scarves of every color <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> up an outfit with the gold thread and tassels hanging off of it.|$|E
500|$|Prints {{were made}} with blocks face up so the printer could vary {{pressure}} for different effects, and watch as paper absorbed the water-based sumi ink, applied quickly in even horizontal strokes. [...] Amongst the printer's tricks were embossing of the image, achieved by pressing an uninked woodblock on the paper to achieve effects, such as the textures of clothing patterns or fishing net. [...] Other effects included burnishing by rubbing with agate <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> colours; varnishing; overprinting; dusting with metal or mica; and sprays to imitate falling snow.|$|E
40|$|Soft {{proofing}} is {{a solution}} for print buyers and printers who want to decrease production cost and cycle time. When print buyers are increasingly specifying brightened papers, {{the use of the}} standard printer ICC profile, e. g., SWOP 3 and GRACoL 2006, as the source color space in the ICC-based color proofing workflow, no longer suffice. This is because the proof looks yellowish in comparison <b>to</b> the <b>brightened</b> print with a bluish white point that print buyers desire. To overcome the mismatch between the soft proof and the brightened print, this research builds a number of source ICC profiles, including profiles built using the substrate-corrected colorimetric aims (SCCA), and profiles built using full dataset. By conducting psychometric tests in a soft proofing environment, the results indicate that (1) the soft proof <b>to</b> <b>brightened</b> print match depends on the source ICC profile; (2) source ICC profiles, built from a fully characterized dataset or the substrate-corrected dataset, improve color match between the soft proof and the brightened print; and (3) the degree of color match between the soft proof and the print is image-dependent...|$|R

500|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, the term 'fairy' {{had been taken}} up as a utopian theme, and was used to {{critique}} social and religious values, a tradition which Tolkien along with T. H. White are seen to continue. One {{of the last of}} the Victorian Fairy-paintings, The Piper of Dreams by Estella Canziani, sold 250,000 copies and was well known within the trenches of World War I where Tolkien saw active service. Illustrated posters of Robert Louis Stevenson's poem Land of Nod had been sent out by a philanthropist <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> servicemen's quarters, and Faery was used in other contexts as an image of [...] "Old England" [...] to inspire patriotism.|$|E
500|$|The {{novel was}} picked {{to be part}} of the young adult fantasy genre due to its {{increasing}} popularity. Cherith Baldry feel that the growth of genre is due to the fact that [...] "fantasy is something very deeply rooted in the human mind, not just for children". Fantasy stories are able to deal with human emotions helping readers to deal with them in the real world. Another Erin Hunter, Kate Cary felt that fantasy books such as Harry Potter [...] "is a sign of a deepening need for fantasy <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> our lives". She describes how as a child she was far less restricted than today's children whose days are structured and scheduled. Cary feels that fantasy stories help kids [...] "escape into the world of the imagination, because it’s the only place they can be really free and un-judged".|$|E
