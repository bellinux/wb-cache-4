5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is relatively inelastic (-1 < Ed < 0), the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than that in price. Hence, when <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>is</b> raised, the total revenue increases, and vice versa.|$|E

50|$|If {{someone was}} selling {{information}} that guaranteed the accurate prediction {{of the future}} market direction, {{we would want to}} purchase this information only if <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>was</b> less than $350. If <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>was</b> greater than $350 we would not purchase the information, if <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>was</b> less than $350 we would purchase the information. If <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>was</b> exactly $350, then our decision is futile.|$|R

5|$|Mayfair is {{the most}} {{expensive}} property on the standard British Monopoly board at £400, and is part of the dark blue set with Park Lane. It commands the highest rents out of all properties; landing on Mayfair with a hotel costs £2,000. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> <b>is</b> a reference to the property values in the area, which have remained consistently high, with real-life rent as much as £36,000 per week. At the time the board was being designed in the 1930s, Mayfair still had a significant upper-class residential population.|$|E

50|$|When <b>the</b> {{current market}} <b>price</b> <b>is</b> less than <b>the</b> average <b>price,</b> <b>the</b> stock <b>is</b> {{considered}} attractive for purchase, {{with the expectation}} that <b>the</b> <b>price</b> will rise. When <b>the</b> current market <b>price</b> <b>is</b> above <b>the</b> average <b>price,</b> <b>the</b> market <b>price</b> <b>is</b> expected to fall. In other words, deviations from <b>the</b> average <b>price</b> <b>are</b> expected to revert to the average.|$|R

5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly elastic (Ed is − ∞), any increase in the price, no matter how small, will cause the quantity demanded for the good to drop to zero. Hence, when <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>is</b> raised, the total revenue falls to zero. This situation is typical for goods that have their value defined by law (such as fiat currency); if a 5 dollar bill were sold for anything more than 5 dollars, nobody would buy it, so demand is zero.|$|E
5|$|In his eighties, Nielsen {{performed}} serious roles {{on screen}} and stage (such as his one-man theatre show Darrow, {{in which he}} played Clarence Darrow), {{as well as providing}} voice-overs and appearances for commercials; cartoons like Zeroman where he had the leading role/voice; children's shows, such as Pumper Pups, which he narrated, in addition to comedic film roles. The sibling relationship with his elder brother, the Honourable Erik Nielsen, a former Deputy Prime Minister of Canada, served as the premise of an HBO mockumentary entitled The Canadian Conspiracy in which Leslie Nielsen appeared, along with other prominent Canadian-born media personalities. He was a celebrity contestant on CBS's Gameshow Marathon, where he played <b>The</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Is</b> Right, Let's Make a Deal, Beat the Clock, and Press Your Luck for charity.|$|E

5|$|One day, {{after trying}} to make the troublemaker Zhang {{apologize}} for bothering another student, Wei discovers that Zhang has left to go find work in the nearby city of Zhangjiakou. The village mayor is unwilling to give her money for a bus ticket to the city, so she resolves to earn the money herself, and recruits the remaining students to help. One girl suggests that they can make money by moving bricks in a nearby brickyard, and Wei begins giving the students mathematical exercises centered on finding out how much money they need to earn for the bus tickets, how many bricks they need to move, and how much time it will take. Through these exercises and working to earn money, her rapport with the class improves. After earning the money, she reaches the bus station but learns that <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>is</b> higher than she thought, and she cannot afford a ticket. Wei ends up walking most of the way to Zhangjiakou.|$|E

5|$|The daily {{syndicated}} {{version of}} Wheel premiered on September 19, 1983, {{preceded by a}} series of episodes taped on location at the Ohio State Fair and aired on WBNS-TV in Columbus, Ohio. From its debut, the syndicated version offered a larger prize budget than its network counterpart. The show came from humble beginnings: King World chairmen Roger, Michael, and Robert King could initially find only 50 stations that were willing to carry the show, and since they could not find affiliates for the syndicated Wheel in New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago, Philadelphia was the largest market in which the show could succeed in its early days. Only nine stations carried the show from its beginning, but by midseason it was airing on all 50 of the stations that were initially willing to carry it, and by the beginning of 1984 the show was available to 99 percent of television households. Soon,Wheel succeeded Family Feud as the highest-rated syndicated show, and {{at the beginning of the}} 1984–85 season, Griffin followed up on the show's success by launching a syndicated revival of Jeopardy!, hosted by Alex Trebek. The syndicated success of Wheel and Jeopardy! siphoned ratings from the period's three longest-running and most popular game shows, Tic-Tac-Dough, The Joker's Wild, and Family Feud, to the point that all three series came to an end by the fall of 1986. At this point, Wheel had the highest ratings of any syndicated television series in history, and at the peak of the show's popularity, over 40 million people were watching five nights per week. The series, along with companion series Jeopardy!, remained the most-watched syndicated program in the United States until dethroned by Judge Judy in 2011. The program has become America's longest-running syndicated game show and its second-longest in either network or syndication, second to the version of <b>The</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Is</b> Right which began airing in 1972. The syndicated Wheel has become part of the consciousness of over 90 million Americans, and awarded a total of over $200 million in cash and prizes to contestants.|$|E
