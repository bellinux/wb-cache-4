40|$|Abstract: In a {{charge-coupled}} device (CCD) -based fast steering mirror (FSM) <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> high <b>control</b> bandwidth {{is the most}} effective way to enhance the closed-loop performance. However, the <b>control</b> <b>system</b> usually suffers a great deal from mechanical resonances and time delays induced by the low sampling rate of CCDs. To meet the requirements of high precision and load restriction, fiber-optic gyroscopes (FOGs) are usually used in traditional FSM <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> In recent years, the MEMS accelerometer and gyroscope are becoming smaller and lighter and their performance have improved gradually, so that they can be used in a fast steering mirror (FSM) to realize the stabilization of the line-of-sight (LOS) of the <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore, a tentative approach to implement a CCD-based FSM <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> which uses MEMS accelerometers and gyroscopes as feedback components and contains an acceleration loop, a velocity loop and a position loop, is proposed. The disturbance suppression of the proposed method is the product of the error attenuation of the acceleration loop, the velocity loop and the position loop. Extensive experimental results show that the MEMS accelerometers and gyroscopes can act the similar role as the FOG with lower cost for stabilizing the LOS of the FSM <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractFlight {{technical}} error (FTE) {{combined with}} navigation system error (NSE) {{is the main}} part of total system error (TSE) in performance based navigation (PBN). The implementation of PBN requires pre-flight prediction and en-route short-term dynamical prediction of the TSE. Once the sum of predicted lateral FTE and NSE is greater than the specified PBN value, the PBN cannot operate. Thus, accurate modeling and thorough analysis of lateral FTE are indispensible. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) lateral <b>track</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> of a transport aircraft is designed using linear quadratic Gaussian and loop transfer recovery (LQG/LTR) method, and the lateral FTE of a turbulence disturbed approach operation is analyzed. The error estimation mapping function of latera FTE and its bound estimation algorithm are proposed based on singular value theory. According to the forming mechanism of lateral FTE, the algorithm considers environmental turbulence fluctuation disturbance, aircraft dynamics and control system parameters. Real-data-based Monte-Carlo simulation validates the theoretical analysis of FTE. It also shows that FTE is mainly caused by turbulence fluctuation disturbance when automatic flight control system (AFCS) is engaged and would increase with escalating environmental turbulence intensity...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{document}} was issued {{under the authority}} of another institution, not NPS. At the time it was written, a copy was added to the NPS Library collection for reasons not now known. It has been included in the digital archive for its historical value to NPS. Not believed to be a CIVINS (Civilian Institutions) title. The purpose of this thesis was to postulate a method of long-range inertial navigation, using only acceleration inputs, and to examine theoretically the responses of this system to external disturbances, using various types of mechanizations. The problem was divided into one of track control and of range indication, using a great-circular path between the points of departure and destination. The response of the <b>track</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> was examined with mechanization equations of as high an order as the fifth, and was found to improve as the order of the mechanization increased. Response to impulse type wind acceleration disturbances was satisfactory, but long-period sinusoidally varying winds caused excessive errors. It appears probable that additional feedback loops, in conjunction with a mechanization equation of the fifth or higher order, will solve the track control problem satisfactorily. In the range indication system, it was found to be impossible to remove any forcing function terms of higher order that the time rate of change of acceleration. It appears probable that the range indication system, as postulated, will prove to be satisfactory, especially if the sensitivities are made variable, {{as a function of the}} angle of the input pendulum.

This paper focuses on the implementation of the approximate dynamic programming algorithm in the network-based <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> of the two-wheeled mobile robot, Pioneer 2 -DX. The proposed discrete <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> consists of the globalised dual heuristic dynamic programming algorithm, the PD controller, the supervisory term, and an additional control signal.

The actor generates the suboptimal control law, while the critic evaluates the realised control strategy by approximation of value function from the Bellman’s equation.

40|$|Abstract—A {{position}} <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> {{is developed}} for a rotorcraft-based {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (RUAV) using robust in-tegral of the signum of the error (RISE) feedback and neural net-work (NN) feedforward terms. While the typical NN-based adap-tive controller guarantees uniformly ultimately bounded stability, the proposed NN-based adaptive <b>control</b> <b>system</b> guarantees semi-global asymptotic tracking of the RUAV using the RISE feedback control. The developed <b>control</b> <b>system</b> consists of an inner-loop and outer-loop. The inner-loop <b>control</b> <b>system</b> determines {{the attitude of the}} RUAV based on an adaptive NN-based linear dynamic model inversion (LDI) method with the RISE feedback. The outer-loop <b>control</b> <b>system</b> generates the attitude reference corresponding to the given position, velocity, and heading references, and controls the altitude of the RUAV by the LDI method with the RISE feed-back. The linear model for the LDI is obtained by a linearization of the nonlinear RUAV dynamics during hover flight. Asymptotic tracking of the attitude and altitude states is proven by a Lya-punov-based stability analysis, and a numerical simulation is per-formed on the nonlinear RUAV model to validate the effectiveness of the controller.
