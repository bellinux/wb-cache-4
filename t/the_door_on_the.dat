5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} {{clerestory}} {{was added to}} the nave, along with the Perpendicular two-storied south porch; these reconstruction works necessitated the repositioning of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south aisle, and the building of the present-day western wall of the nave, with a great window and door also in the Perpendicular style. Stained glass windows were installed in the clerestory, but their contents were not recorded, and only small fragments of the mediaeval glass survive today: the arms of the Cheyne family, a human figure, and a shield with fragments of coloured glass, possibly the impaled arms of Woburn and Leicester. A staircase in the porch led to a parvise above; local tradition holds that Thomas Harding was held in the parvise prior to his execution in 1532. The porch also contains a stoup dating from the late 14th century, which although much damaged has survived all subsequent restorations and remodellings unaltered.|$|E

A long, low passageway, which helped keep out outside weather, led to an entry room that had an interior buffalo-skin door on a hinge. It could be closed at night and wedged shut. Opposite <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west side of the central room, a buffalo skull with horns was displayed. This was considered great medicine.|$|E

500|$|The IOC's {{decision}} to shortlist Rio de Janeiro over Doha generated criticism, as the Doha bid committee accused the IOC of [...] "closing <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Arab world" [...] and {{of making a}} political decision rather than judging on technical grounds. Doha outperformed Rio de Janeiro {{in the majority of}} the categories assessed, but according to the IOC, Doha's desire to stage the Olympics in October because of high temperatures was the reason the bid was rejected. On May 3, 2009, the Rio de Janeiro bid committee accused the Madrid bid committee of sending a spy to Rio de Janeiro during the visit of the Evaluation Commission, and considered filing a formal ethics complaint with the IOC. Simon Walsh, who claimed to be a reporter working for EFE, omitted {{the fact that he was}} a paid consultant of the Madrid bid committee and was stripped of his media accreditation. Madrid officials denied the accusations.
