5|$|Significantly, {{the treaty}} {{did not mention}} or {{institute}} any social reforms that Madero had vaguely promised on previous occasions. It also left the Porfirian state essentially intact. Additionally, Madero supported the unpopular idea that all land disputes were to be settled <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts,</b> staffed by the old judges, a decision that led to outbreaks of sporadic violence, particularly in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|The French PACS is not included, nor {{are some}} other legal {{relationships}} – for example, the Dutch civil partnership {{and some of the}} domestic partnerships in the United States. The reason is that these kinds of relationships can be dissolved by agreement between the parties (that is by both parties signing a document with a lawyer), not <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Citing {{the trust}} {{relationship}} between {{the federal government and}} the tribes, the Court held that removal treaties could only be enforced against the tribes by the federal government, not private parties (whether through self-help or <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts).</b> In other words, the federal government retained the discretion not to enforce such treaties. At the same time, the Court held that enrolled treaties are conclusively valid, and refused to consider the plaintiffs claim that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838) was fraudulent.|$|E

5|$|The Civil Partnership Act {{came into}} effect on 1 January 2011. It had been {{expected}} that the first ceremonies would not take place until April 2011 due to a three-month waiting period required by law for all civil ceremonies. However, the legislation does provide a mechanism for exemptions to be sought <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts,</b> and the first partnership, which was between two men, was registered on 7 February 2011. While this ceremony was carried out publicly in the Civil Registration Office in Dublin, the mainstream media were not present.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} effect of Peterloo was {{a crackdown on}} reform. The government instructed the police and courts {{to go after the}} journalists, presses and publication of the Manchester Observer. Wroe {{was arrested and charged with}} producing a seditious publication. Found guilty he was sentenced to twelve months in prison and fined £100. Outstanding court cases against the Manchester Observer were rushed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> and a continual change of sub-editors was not sufficient defence against a series of police raids, often on the suspicion that someone was writing a radical article. The Manchester Observer closed in February 1820.|$|E
5|$|The {{safety of}} high energy {{particle}} collisions was {{a topic of}} widespread discussion and topical interest during {{the time when the}} Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and later the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)—currently the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator—were being constructed and commissioned. Concerns arose that such high energy experiments—designed to produce novel particles and forms of matter—had the potential to create harmful states of matter or even doomsday scenarios. Claims escalated as commissioning of the LHC drew closer, around 2008–2010. The claimed dangers included the production of stable micro black holes and the creation of hypothetical particles called strangelets, and these questions were explored in the media, on the Internet and at times <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts.</b>|$|E

5|$|Through 1935, as {{the breakup}} {{legislation}} wound through Congress, and litigation <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts,</b> Willkie was the industry's chief spokesman and lobbyist. When the Senate narrowly {{passed a bill}} for the breakup, Willkie {{made a series of}} speeches asking the public to oppose the legislation, and a storm of letters to congressmen followed. After the House of Representatives defeated the breakup clause, investigation proved that many of these communications were funded by the electric companies, signed with names taken from the telephone book, though Willkie was not implicated. Amid public anger, Roosevelt pressured Congress to pass a bill requiring the breakup to take place within three years.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi was cremated per the Hindu tradition. Gandhi's ashes were {{poured into}} urns which were sent across India for {{memorial}} services. Most of the ashes were immersed at the Sangam at Allahabad on 12 February 1948, but some were secretly taken away. In 1997, Tushar Gandhi immersed {{the contents of}} one urn, found in a bank vault and reclaimed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts,</b> at the Sangam at Allahabad. Some of Gandhi's ashes were scattered at {{the source of the}} Nile River near Jinja, Uganda, and a memorial plaque marks the event. On 30 January 2008, the contents of another urn were immersed at Girgaum Chowpatty. Another urn is at the palace of the Aga Khan in Pune (where Gandhi was held as a political prisoner from 1942 to 1944) and another in the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season saw Palace {{make the}} play offs {{for the third}} time in four seasons but they failed to progress to the final, losing to Watford. Palace also lost another manager, as Dowie left the club stating that he wanted to be closer to his family in Bolton. Jordan had accepted Dowie's reasons and waived a £1million compensation fee in the manager's contract. However, when Dowie was appointed as manager of Charlton Athletic Jordan pursued him <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts,</b> eventually settling the affair in April 2008. Former fans favourite Peter Taylor succeeded Dowie as manager for the 2006–07 season. Taylor was unsuccessful in getting Palace promoted, and was replaced by Neil Warnock two months into the 2007–08 season. Warnock guided the team to the 2008 Football League Championship play-offs where they lost in the semi-finals to Bristol City. Palace followed this with a fifteenth-place finish the next season.|$|E

25|$|It was not {{possible}} to sue the Crown in the UK for breach of contract before 1948.

Like his uncle, Jefferson Levy commissioned repairs, restoration and preservation of the grounds and house, which had been deteriorating seriously while the lawsuits wound their way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> in New York and Virginia.

Terranova together with PCI deputy Pio La Torre wrote the minority report of the Antimafia Commission that was published in 1976, which pointed to links between the Mafia and prominent politicians in particular of the Christian Democrat party (DC - Democrazia Cristiana).|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{surgical}} castration {{was used to}} lower sex drive by reducing testosterone. The emergence of pharmacological methods of adjusting testosterone has made it largely obsolete, because they are similarly effective and less invasive. It is still occasionally performed in Germany, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and a few U.S. states. Non-randomized studies have reported that {{surgical castration}} reduces recidivism in contact sex offenders. The Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers opposes surgical castration and the Council of Europe works to bring the practice {{to an end in}} Eastern European countries where it is still applied <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts.</b>|$|E
