On July 8, 1943, Kimball received {{a telephone call}} from J. Reuben Clark, the first counselor to church president Heber J. Grant, notifying him that he had been called to fill one of the vacancies. Kimball was initially so shocked by the call that he asked Clark's permission to ponder it for several days before he went to Salt Lake City to meet with him in person, as part of a previously-scheduled family trip. After <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call,</b> Kimball's desire to accept the calling was overwhelmed by feelings of self-doubt and incompetence.

After an intense emotional and spiritual struggle, Kimball had an unusual dream, which gave him peace on his ability to accept the calling.
