People with liver problems <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to medical attention earlier, generally as children or teenagers, than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, {{who tend to be}} in their twenties or older. Some are identified only because relatives have been diagnosed with Wilson's disease; many of these, when tested, turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but have not received a diagnosis.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the cost}} of {{developing}} these resources (they tend to be capital intensive), they <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> on stream later in the cycle of petroleum resource development in a given producing region. This is because oil companies tend to extract the light, high-value oils first. The more difficult-to-extract resources are developed later, generally during periods of high commodity prices, such as the extended period of higher prices which began in the early 1970s.|$|E

Her volleys <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> more from her forehand, her stronger side, which she executes by moving her racket {{in a straight}} line, also allowing her to disguise the shot well enough from her opponents. In the slice department, she {{has the ability to}} keep the ball low and performs the shot better on her backhand wing. Due to her tall frame, she is known to make up for her lack of speed by playing close to the baseline. Her game suits the fast courts and she cites grass as her favourite surface.|$|E

These dinners, also known as microwave meals, {{can be purchased at}} most supermarkets. They are stored frozen. To prepare them, the plastic cover is removed or vented, and the meal is heated in a microwave oven for a few minutes. They are convenient since they essentially require no preparation time other than the heating, although some frozen dinners may require the preparer to briefly carry out an intermediate step (such as stirring mashed potatoes midway through the heating cycle) to ensure adequate heating and uniform consistency of component items.|$|E
25|$|There {{are seven}} {{players in the}} water from each team at one time. There are six players that play out and one goalkeeper. Unlike most common team sports, there is little {{positional}} play; field players will often fill several positions throughout the game as situations demand. These positions usually consist of a center forward, a center back, the two wing players and the two drivers. Players who are skilled in all positions of offense or defense are called utility players. Utility players <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> off of the bench, though this is not absolute. Certain body types are more suited for particular positions, and left-handed players are especially coveted {{on the right-hand side}} of the field, allowing teams to launch two-sided attacks.|$|E

25|$|Thinking {{and feeling}} are the {{decision-making}} (judging) functions. The thinking and feeling functions are both {{used to make}} rational decisions, based on the data received from their information-gathering functions (sensing or intuition). Those who prefer thinking tend to decide things from a more detached standpoint, measuring the decision by what seems reasonable, logical, causal, consistent, and matching a given set of rules. Those who prefer feeling <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to decisions by associating or empathizing with the situation, looking at it 'from the inside' and weighing the situation to achieve, on balance, the greatest harmony, consensus and fit, considering {{the needs of the}} people involved. Thinkers usually have trouble interacting with people who are inconsistent or illogical, and tend to give very direct feedback to others. They are concerned with the truth and view it as more important.|$|E
25|$|A catcher {{nearly always}} throws {{with his right}} hand. Since most hitters are {{right-handed}} and stand {{to the left side}} of the plate when batting, a catcher who throws left-handed is forced to take some time to sidestep (or otherwise avoid) the right-handed hitter when he throws from behind the plate. In addition, a lefty's throw would <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in on the shortstop side of the bag, while a righty's throw would be on the second base side of the bag, which is where the runner is coming in. Consequently, players who are left-handed rarely play catcher. Left-handed catchers have only caught eleven big-league games since 1902, and Jack Clements, who played for 17 years at the end of the nineteenth century, is the only man in the history of baseball to play more than three hundred games as a left-handed catcher. However, some observers, including the famed statistician Bill James and ESPN writer Rob Neyer, have suggested that the real reason that there are no left-handed catchers is because left-handed players with strong throwing arms are almost always encouraged, at an early age, to become pitchers. Benny Distefano, the last lefty thrower to catch a big-league game (in 1989), noted that lefty catchers have difficulty on bunts up the third base line and on fielding throws home for plays at the plate.|$|E
25|$|Surfing is also {{a popular}} water {{activity}} in Indonesia and the sites are recognised as world class. The well-known sports are mostly located on the southern, Indian Ocean side of Indonesia, for example, the large oceanic surf breaks on southern Java. However, the north coast does not receive the same surf from the Java Sea. Surf breaks can be found all the way along Sumatra, down to Nusa Tenggara, including Aceh, Bali, Banten, Java, Lombok, the Mentawai Islands, and Sumbawa. Although Indonesia has many world-class surfing spots, the majority of surfers are came from abroad, especially Australia and United States. However, the seed of local surfing enthusiast began develop in Bali and West Java's Pelabuhan Ratu and Pangandaran beach, mostly came from nearby cities of Jakarta and Bandung. On Bali, there are about 33 surf spots, from West Bali to East Bali including four on the offshore island of Nusa Lembongan. In Sumbawa, Hu'u and Lakey Beach in Cempi Bay are popular surfing spots among surfing enthusiast. Sumatra is the second island, with the most number of surf spots, with 18 altogether. The common time for surfing is around May to September with the trade winds blowing from east to south-east. From October to April, winds <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from the west to north-west, so the east coast breaks get the offshore winds.|$|E

Stanton began writing the screenplay during the post-production of A Bug's Life. As a result, Finding Nemo began production with a complete screenplay, something that co-director Lee Unkrich called [...] "very unusual for an animated film".

He is nearly killed by comedic actor Jimmy Fallon, but is relieved when he learns that Pumpkin [...] "died".|$|E

500|$|Eco {{also noted}} that the Bond villains <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from Central Europe or from Slavic or Mediterranean {{countries}} and have a mixed heritage and [...] "complex and obscure origins". Eco found that the villains were generally asexual or homosexual, inventive, organisationally astute, and wealthy. Black observed the same point: [...] "Fleming did not use class enemies for his villains instead relying on physical distortion or ethnic identity... Furthermore, in Britain foreign villains used foreign servants and employees... This racism reflected not only a pronounced theme of interwar adventure writing, such as the novels of Buchan, but also wider literary culture." [...] Writer Louise Welsh found that the novel Live and Let Die [...] "taps into the paranoia that some sectors of white society were feeling" [...] as the civil rights movements challenged prejudice and inequality.|$|E
500|$|Most modern count-classifiers {{are derived}} from words that {{originally}} were free-standing nouns in older varieties of Chinese, and have since been grammaticalized to become bound morphemes. In other words, count-classifiers <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from words that once had specific meaning but lost it (a process known as semantic bleaching). Many, however, still have related forms that work as nouns all by themselves, such as the classifier (...) dài for long, ribbon-like objects: the modern word dàizi means [...] "ribbon". In fact, the majority of classifiers {{can also be used}} as other parts of speech, such as nouns. Mass-classifiers, on the other hand, are more transparent in meaning than count-classifiers; while the latter have some historical meaning, the former are still full-fledged nouns. For example, (bēi, cup), is both a classifier as in (yì [...] chá, [...] "a [...] of tea") and the word for a cup as in (jiǔbēi, [...] "wine glass").|$|E
