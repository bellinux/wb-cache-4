These and other recent developments have sparked interest in privacy-preserving methods: computational approaches which are able to utilise the data without leaking subjects' personal information. Classical encryption techniques have been used very successfully to protect data in <b>transit</b> <b>and</b> in <b>storage.</b> However, the process of encrypting data also renders it unusable in computation. Recently developed fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) techniques improve on this substantially. Unlike classical methods, which require the data to be decrypted prior to computation, homomorphic methods allow data to be simultaneously stored or transfered securely, and used in computation. However, FHE imposes serious constraints on computation, both arithmetic (e. g., no divisions can be performed) and computational (e. g., multiplications become much slower), rendering traditional statistical algorithms inadequate. In this thesis we develop statistical and machine learning methods for outsourced, privacy-preserving analysis of sensitive information under FHE. Specifically, we tackle two problems: (i) classification, using a semiparametric approach based on the naive Bayes assumption and modeling the class decision boundary directly using an approximation to univariate logistic regression; (ii) regression, using two approaches; an accelerated method for least squares estimation based on gradient descent, and a cooperative framework for Bayesian regression based on recursive Bayesian updating in a multi-party setting. Taking into account the constraints imposed by FHE, we analyse the potential of different algorithmic approaches to provide tractable solutions to these problems and give details on several computational costs and performance trade-offs. </p...|$|R

This study aims at {{the evaluation}} of a bambara groundnut protein isolate (BGPI) -alginate matrix designed for encapsulating a probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The response surface methodology was employed to gain the optimal concentrations of BGPI and alginate on encapsulation efficiency and survival of encapsulated cells. The capsules were prepared at the optimal combination by the traditional extrusion method composed of 8. 66 % w/v BGPI and 1. 85 % w/v alginate. The encapsulation efficiency was 97. 24 %, whereas the survival rates in an acidic condition and after the freeze-drying process were 95. 56 % and 95. 20 %, respectively—higher than those using either BGPI or alginate as the encapsulating agent individually.

In total, 88 consecutive collections from autologous (n = 25) and allogeneic (n = 63) donors were included. The mean collection volume was 1250 +/- 398 ml with RBC content of 341 +/- 113 ml. The MNC and CD 34 + cell recoveries were 83. 3 +/- 18. 5 and 88. 1 +/- 18. 9 %, respectively, volume depletion was 88. 2 +/- 4. 4 % and RBC depletion 98. 3 +/- 1. 8 %. Neutrophil engraftment was achieved in 20. 1 +/- 6. 4 days. Factors affecting MNC and CD 34 + cell recoveries were transit time (P = 0. 0060), overall age (P 0. 8161) or neutrophil engraftment (P = 0. 8959). This study demonstrates that time in transit, overall age, MNC and CD 34 + cell concentrations and RBC condition were important factors affecting processing.

40|$|Background Urothelium is {{generally}} considered to be impermeable to water and constituents of urine. The possibility that human urothelium expresses aquaporin (AQP) water channels as the basis for water and solute transport has not previously been investigated. Objective To investigate the expression of AQP water channels by human urothelium in situ, in proliferating urothelial cell cultures and in differentiated tissue constructs. Design, setting, and participants AQP expression by human urothelium in situ and cultured urothelial cells was assessed by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunolabelling. Expression screening was carried out on samples of freshly isolated urothelia from multiple surgical (bladder and ureteric) specimens and on proliferating and differentiated normal human urothelial (NHU) cells in culture. Urothelial tissue constructs were established and investigated for expression of urothelial differentiation markers and AQPs. Measurements Qualitative study. Results and limitations Transcripts for AQP 3, AQP 4, AQP 7, AQP 9, and AQP 11 were expressed consistently by freshly isolated urothelia as well as by cultured NHU cells. AQP 0, AQP 1, AQP 2, AQP 5, AQP 6, AQP 8, AQP 10, and AQP 12 were not expressed. Immunochemistry confirmed expression of AQP 3, AQP 4, AQP 7, and AQP 9 at the protein level. AQP 3 was shown to be intensely expressed at cell borders in the basal and intermediate layers in both urothelium in situ and differentiated tissue constructs in vitro. Conclusions This is the first study to demonstrate that AQPs are expressed by human urothelium, suggesting a potential role in transurothelial water and solute transport.

In this context, the European FP 6 SAFIR project (Safe and High Quality Food Production using Low Quality Waters and Improved Irrigation Systems and Management) investigates the geochemical quality of the root zone soil, knowing it is the main <b>transit</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> compartment for pollutants. The type of reaction (sorption, co-precipitation...) and the reactive mineral phases also determine the availability of trace elements for the plant and determine the passage towards crops and products. Reactions of the infiltrating water with the soil solid phase are important for the solute cycling, temporary fixation and remobilisation of trace pollutants. Therefore the soil water quality was directly or indirectly assessed. Direct measurements of soil water were made through porous cups. The experiments were carried out during the growing season of 2006, 2007 and 2008 in a vegetable commercial farm, located at 10 km north of Belgrade. The soil is silty clayey, and developed on alluvial deposits. It was classified as humogley according to USDA Soil Classification. The climate of the field side is a continental type with hot and dry summers and cold and rainy winters. As in the rest of Serbia, farm suffers from water deficits during the main growing season. The initial soil quality was assessed through a sampling campaign before the onset of first year irrigation; the soil quality was then monitored throughout three years. Soil sampling focused on the fully irrigated plots because the potential impact of irrigation water quality on soil and plant quality are expected higher for fully irrigated soils compared to other irrigation strategies. Samples were taken within the soil volume of potential influence around each of the drip emitters. Potato (Solanum tuberosum) variety Liseta was used for investigation. The seeds tubers were planted in the similar period in all three seasons (middle of Spring) at the depth of 10 cm. Two irrigation methods were used in all three seasons: drip and furrow systems. Water for irrigation was supplied from a channel which is located 100 m away from the experimental field. For all experiments, three sampling campaigns were foreseen {{for each of the three}} irrigation seasons: at pre-planting, at the end of irrigation, and at harvest. After three campaigns, the results show a variability of the elements concentrations in water and soil between the three years. The soil appears significantly depleted in CaO (a mean of - 40 %), MgO (- 20 %), Na (- 30 %), and Sr (- 10 %) and Pb (- 12 %). On the contrary, concentrations of Mn, Ni, V and Li slightly increase (+ 15 to 20 %) whereas SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3, Cu and Cr do not significantly increase (a mean of + 10 %). Knowing that potatoes do need between 40 to 50 kg per ha of CaO and 15 to 30 kg per ha of MgO (Soltner, 1999), potato absorption of Ca and Mg may be the main sink for both elements. A statistical analysis (ACP) shows precisely a Ca-Mg-Sr pole which explains more than 90 % of the second component; the first component being explained by Al 2 O 3, SiO 2, Fe 2 O 3 and TiO 2 at the same percentage...|$|E
