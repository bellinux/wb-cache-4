Currently because of its increasing rate, it has drawn the attention of psychologists, sociologists and criminologists both at the International and national scene. Not only it has given a strong blow to our social and cultural heritage but also affected the social structure of Indian society. Against this background, the present paper focusses attention on various causes of female criminality in India and its consequences upon our society. With the help of various theoretical models the authors have analysed the various factors which make women crime prone. Finally, some significant and relevant suggestion have been provided to prevent and control the increasing trend...|$|R

They are likely to be illiterate or poorly educated, unlikely to be employed, most likely to be widowed and dependent on others, and they suffer from malnutrition and disabilitating symptoms as well as report higher psychological distress. The vulnerability of the ageing women, special types of problems they are likely to encounter over the life span, and factors that marginalise them need to be better understood. There is no clear awareness as yet, of the potential contribution of ageing women to the development process as ageing women are stereotypically perceived as burdens on the national economy.

Originally a term used extensively in literary theory, “postcoloniality” seems suddenly to {{have been given a}} prominent part to play in research on translation in <b>Third</b> World <b>countries,</b> particularly <b>India.</b> Undoubtedly, postcolonial theory should have some relevance to all countries that were colonized in one way or another. That being the case, much thought ought to be given to the relevance of postcolonial translation to China. To be sure, China has not been formally occupied by a foreign power in the past century, so she has not experienced a “colonial” period as did her Southeast Asian neighbours, India and most African countries. Indeed, extraterritorial rights over certain parts of the country (like Shanghai and the Yangtze River) were claimed at certain times by foreign powers: Hong Kong was ceded to Britain (though she entered her postcolonial period with the 1997 Chinese takeover); and Taiwan was colonized by the Dutch and by the Japanese (from {{the end of the nineteenth}} century to the end of World War II). However, for mainland China, where the majority of translations are still carried out and published, the term “postcoloniality” may not mean much. What use do we have for postcolonial theories of translation in the Chinese context...|$|R

The present study was carried out to estimate the prevalence of various behavioural risk factors for chronic diseases, and to identify their biosocial correlates. Methods: A cross-sectional study was done in which the data were collected from a sample of 6579 individuals of age 30 to 74 yr, randomly selected following a stratified multi-stage cluster sampling design covering Kerala State. The important factors investigated include various behavioural risk factors, presenting chronic diseases and family histories among close relatives. The data were analysed using both univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: The two major risk factors observed among males were smoking and alcohol consumption. About two fifths (40 %) of them were current smokers as well as current users of alcohol (41 %). The median age at initiation was 21 yr for both smoking habits and for alcohol consumption...|$|R
