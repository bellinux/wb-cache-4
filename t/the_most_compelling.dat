5|$|There {{are several}} {{criticisms of the}} three-tiered {{scrutiny}} analysis, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> reason against its adoption arguably being {{that it does not}} control judicial discretion: the identification of classifications as suspect, quasi-suspect or non-suspect involves unconstrained balancing of public and private interests, and political and social interests.|$|E
5|$|Several unusual supernovae and impostors {{have been}} {{compared}} to Eta Carinae as examples of its possible fate. One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> is SN 2009ip, a blue supergiant which underwent a supernova impostor event in 2009 with similarities to Eta Carinae's Great Eruption, then an even brighter outburst in 2012 {{which is likely to}} have been a true supernova. SN 2006jc, some 77 million light years away in UGC 4904, in the constellation Lynx, also underwent a supernova impostor brightening in 2004, followed by a magnitude 13.8 type Ib supernova, first seen on 9 October 2006. Eta Carinae has also {{been compared to}} other possible supernova impostors such as SN 1961V, and to superluminous supernovae such as SN 2006gy.|$|E
5|$|Congress held {{hearings}} on the two bills {{in the summer of}} 1986. Admiral William J. Crowe Jr., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, led the Pentagon's opposition to the bills. He proposed, as an alternative, a new Special Operations Forces command led by a three-star general. This proposal was not well received on Capitol Hill—Congress wanted a four-star general in charge to give SOF more clout. A number of retired military officers and others testified in favor of the need for reform. By most accounts, retired Army Major General Richard Scholtes gave <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> reasons for change. Scholtes, who commanded the joint special operations task force in Grenada, explained how conventional force leaders misused SOF during the operation, not allowing them to use their unique capabilities, which resulted in high SOF casualties. After his formal testimony, Scholtes met privately with a small number of Senators to elaborate on the problems that he had encountered in Grenada.|$|E

5|$|His {{greatest}} {{and most}} famous wartime contribution was the Seventh Symphony. The composer {{wrote the first}} three movements in Leningrad and completed the work in Kuibyshev (now Samara) {{where he and his}} family had been evacuated. It remains unclear whether Shostakovich really conceived the idea of the symphony with the siege of Leningrad in mind, it was officially claimed as a representation of the people of Leningrad’s brave resistance to the German invaders and an authentic piece of patriotic art at a time when morale needed boosting. The symphony was first premiered by the Bolshoi Theatre orchestra in Kuibyshev and was soon performed abroad in London and the United States. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> performance was the Leningrad premiere by the Radio Orchestra in the besieged city. The orchestra had only fourteen musicians left, so the conductor Karl Eliasberg had to recruit anyone who could play a musical instrument to perform the symphony.|$|E

25|$|Of all {{the reasons}} Lori and Corey found for {{creating}} a bridge between Trial by Fire and Shadows of Darkenss, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> was {{the feeling that the}} Hero character simply hadn't matured enough to face the very grim challenges awaiting him in Transylvania.|$|E

25|$|Pre-existing {{disadvantage}} {{asks whether}} there was a pre-existing disadvantage or vulnerability experienced by the claimant. In Corbiere v.

25|$|She {{sent her}} first-person {{account of this}} {{experience}} months later to her sister Esther without rereading it, and it remains one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> early accounts of a mastectomy.

She survived and returned to England in 1812 to visit her ailing father and to avoid young Alexander's conscription into the French army, while still in recovery from her own illness.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> {{reason for}} {{increasing}} the emphasis on this southern drive {{had more to do}} with the actions of Americans than those of Germans. While Montgomery was carefully and cautiously planning for the main thrust in the north, complete with massive artillery preparation and an airborne assault, American forces in the south were displaying the kind of basic aggressiveness that Eisenhower wanted to see. On 7 March, Lieutenant General Courtney Hodges's U.S. 1st Army captured the last intact bridge over the Rhine at Remagen and steadily expanded the bridgehead.|$|E

G4TV editor Michael Leffler called her a wonderful addition to the series, adding that she balances Link out. Nintendo Power, in discussing the ending to Twilight Princess, describes the relationship between Link and Midna as one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> in The Legend of Zelda history.

25|$|The Journal {{claims to}} have sent the first news report, on the Dow Jones wire, of a plane {{crashing}} into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged {{by the collapse of}} the World Trade Center just across the street. Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue {{for the first time in}} the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick, N.J., corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor (and current Washington bureau chief) John Bussey, who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the Journal offices and filling them with dust and debris. The Journal won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories.|$|E
500|$|Scholar Paul Buhle asserted, [...] "More {{than a few}} {{readers have}} {{described}} [...] as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> of any [...] depiction, perhaps because only the caricatured quality of comic art {{is equal to the}} seeming unreality of an experience beyond all reason."

5000|$|Jason Heller, of The A.V.

The dynamic feels like it's lifted straight from Thor and Loki, and that archetypal resonance is what Weis and Hickman are obviously shooting for. And almost entirely hit." ...|$|R

500|$|Despite the mainly {{positive}} reviews, {{the novel}} has received some negative criticism. One critical review by Children's Literature writer Tina Gregory {{points out that}} [...] "the novel lacks at certain points necessary descriptive details of the characters and settings.

[...] The same School Library Journal review which praised the novel's [...] "exciting scenes and cliff-hanger chapters" [...] also had this to say: [...] "Gregor is not <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> figure at first, but as the story progresses he becomes more interesting, maturing through the challenges he faces." ...|$|E

According to Warner Bros., this covered {{the cost of}} the entire Midway asset acquisition. One year after the game's release, GameZone's Sanchez stated that Mortal Kombat has still remained [...] "the best fighter currently on the market," [...] calling it [...] "today's greatest modern fighter" [...] and [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> fighters to come along in years." ...|$|E

Though the painting's unusual composition was noted from its earliest viewings, initially its subject was interpreted simply as that of girls at play, but it has subsequently been viewed in more abstract terms, reflecting Freudian analysis and a greater interest in the ambiguities of adolescence.|$|R
50|$|Potential pitchers, who cannot {{already be}} {{established}} filmmakers, must submit {{a very brief}} description of their idea for a documentary film. <b>The</b> eight <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> ideas are selected, and the shortlisted directors must then pitch their idea to a panel of Channel 4 commissioners {{in front of an}} industry audience at the annual Sheffield International Documentary Festival.

5000|$|The reviews were {{unanimously}} negative, {{with particular}} disbelief at Peter Allen's attempts to play so totally against type as a suave lothario.

[...] The failure of the musical was so total that it compelled the Nederlander Organization to finally sell the beloved but flop-prone Mark Hellinger Theatre to the Times Square Church, which still owns it.|$|R
