40|$|Abstract—Automated <b>test</b> {{design is}} an {{approach}} to <b>test</b> design in which automata are utilized for generating <b>test</b> artifacts such as <b>test</b> cases and <b>test</b> data from a formal <b>test</b> basis, most often called <b>test</b> model. A <b>test</b> generator operates on such a <b>test</b> model to meet a certain <b>test</b> coverage goal. In the plethora of the approaches, tools and standards for model-based <b>test</b> design, the <b>test</b> design techniques to be applied and <b>test</b> coverage goals to be met {{are not part of}} the <b>test</b> model, which may easily lead to difficulties regarding comprehensibility and repeatability of the <b>test</b> design process. This paper analyzes current approaches to and languages for automated model-based <b>test</b> design and shows that they are lacking important information about the applied <b>test</b> design techniques. Based on this analysis, we propose to introduce another layer of abstraction for expressing <b>test</b> design techniques in a tool-independent, yet generic way.
