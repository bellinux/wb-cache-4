5|$|Four {{months after}} her proxy {{marriage}} <b>to</b> <b>Louis,</b> Sigismund entered Hungary and married Mary, but the reconciliation between the fractions {{turned out to be}} too late to forestall Charles' invasion. Sigismund fled to his brother's court in Prague in the autumn of 1385.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{marched to}} Dalmatia in July 1357. Split, Trogir, and Šibenik soon {{got rid of}} Venetian {{governors}} and yielded <b>to</b> <b>Louis.</b> After a short siege, Louis's army also captured Zadar {{with the assistance of}} its townspeople. Tvrtko I of Bosnia, who had succeeded Louis's father-in-law in 1353, surrendered western Hum <b>to</b> <b>Louis,</b> who claimed that territory as his wife's dowry. In the Treaty of Zadar, which was signed on 18 February 1358, the Republic of Venice renounced all Dalmatian towns and islands between the Gulf of Kvarner and Durazzo in favor of Louis. The Republic of Ragusa also accepted Louis's suzerainty. The Dalmatian towns remained self-governing communities, owing only a yearly tribute and naval service <b>to</b> <b>Louis,</b> who also abolished all commercial restrictions that had been introduced during the Venetians' rule. The merchants of Ragusa were explicitly entitled to freely trade in Serbia even during a war between Hungary and Serbia.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the nearly}} {{contemporaneous}} chronicle of John of Küküllő, Louis launched his first campaign against {{a group of}} Transylvanian Saxons, who had refused to pay taxes, and forced them to yield {{in the summer of}} 1344. During his stay in Transylvania, Nicholas Alexanderwho was the son of Basarab, the ruling prince of Wallachiaswore loyalty <b>to</b> <b>Louis</b> on his father's behalf in Brassó (now Brașov in Romania); thus the suzerainty of the Hungarian monarchs over Wallachia was, at least outwardly, restored.|$|E

5|$|During the 17th century, Cardinal Richelieu, chief {{minister}} of Louis XIII, {{was determined to}} make Paris the most beautiful city in Europe. He built five new bridges, a new chapel for the College of Sorbonne, and a palace for himself, the Palais Cardinal, which he bequeathed <b>to</b> <b>Louis</b> XIII. After Richelieu's death in 1642, it was the renamed as the Palais-Royal.|$|E
5|$|In 1809, he {{acquired}} the Chateau de Ville-au-Val at Meurthe-et-Moselle. In 1816, {{he was elected}} to the Chamber of Deputies by the Department of the Meurthe. He married Marie Isabelle Van Oldencel (died in Nancy, 13 June 1855). They had a daughter, Adelaide Ernestine Josephine, born 11 October 1805, who married <b>to</b> <b>Louis</b> Henry Gau, the son of Charles Louis Joseph Gau of Frégeville.|$|E
5|$|Libertine and unruly in conduct from {{an early}} age, her {{relations}} {{with her husband and}} his family were tempestuous and often bitter, with repeated appeals for mediation <b>to</b> <b>Louis</b> XIV.

5|$|Mary {{was born}} {{in the latter half of}} 1371 <b>to</b> <b>Louis</b> the Great, King of Hungary and Poland, and his second wife, Elizabeth of Bosnia. She was the second {{daughter}} of her parents. They had been childless for over a decade before Mary's older sister, Catherine, {{was born in}} 1370. Mary and Catherine gained another sibling, Jadwiga, in 1374.|$|E
5|$|Mary's fiancé Sigismund and {{his brother}} Wenceslaus, King of Germany and Bohemia, were also opposed to Elizabeth and Garai. The queen dowager and the Palatine, on the other hand, were not {{enthusiastic}} about Sigismund reigning together with Mary. Both Sigismund and Charles schemed to invade Hungary; the former intended to marry Mary and become her co-ruler, while the latter intended to depose her. Elizabeth was determined to allow neither and, in 1384, started negotiating Mary's marriage <b>to</b> <b>Louis</b> of France, notwithstanding her daughter's engagement to Sigismund. Had this proposal been made after Catherine's death in 1378, the Western Schism would have represented a problem, with France recognising ClementVII as pope and Hungary accepting UrbanVI. However, Elizabeth was desperate to avoid an invasion in 1384 and unwilling to let the schism {{stand in the way}} of the negotiations with the French. ClementVII issued a dispensation which annulled Mary's betrothal to Sigismund, and her proxy marriage <b>to</b> <b>Louis</b> was celebrated in April 1385, but it was not recognized by the Hungarian noblemen, who adhered to Urban VI.|$|E

50|$|Because of his {{dispute with}} King Rudolf {{concerning}} the Vaud and other Swiss regions, Philip granted it <b>to</b> his nephew <b>Louis,</b> who by September 1281 was receiving the homage of the vassals of the region. In May 1284 Louis's position {{was confirmed by}} Rudolf, who granted him the right to mint coin within the pays de Vaud. Another settlement was needed {{following the death of}} Philip I in 1285. Savoy fell <b>to</b> <b>Louis's</b> brother Amadeus V, who was forced <b>to</b> recognise <b>Louis's</b> possession of all the territories in the pays de Vaud formerly held by Count Peter (1286).|$|R
5|$|The Hôtel d'Alluye is a hôtel particulier in Blois, Loir-et-Cher, France. Built for Florimond Robertet {{when he was}} {{secretary}} and notary <b>to</b> <b>Louis</b> XII, the residence bears {{the name of his}} barony of Alluyes.

5|$|The War of Chioggia erupted {{between the}} old-time rival Republics of Venice and Genoa in 1378, and it soon {{involved}} Venice's neighbours. King Louis took Genoa's side; and Ragusa—subordinate to Hungary, and Venice's competitor in the Adriatic—did so as well. The Venetians, having taken Kotor in August 1378, {{made an effort}} to have Tvrtko join the war on their side, which caused panic in Ragusa. Tvrtko, however, offered the Ragusans help in fighting Venice, which they initially refused. The death of George I of Zeta warranted Tvrtko's involvement in Serbian affairs, which reduced his ability to take an active part in the conflict. The Ragusans started calling for the destruction of Kotor, whose officials promised to renounce fealty to Venice and return <b>to</b> <b>Louis.</b> Kotor failed to fulfill this promise, but instead promised fealty to Tvrtko, who laid claim to the city as part of his Nemanjić ancestors' heritage. The political climate was ideal, since he was to take Kotor from his overlord's enemy. The Ragusans were furious, and an embargo ensued. Tvrtko defended Kotor from Ragusa, but was betrayed in June 1379, when the city overthrew its Venetian governor and submitted again directly <b>to</b> <b>Louis.</b>|$|E

5|$|The next morning, Mulder shows Scully some tracks by {{the front}} door of the house that appear to be human. Based on the weight distribution, however, the assailant evidently travels on the balls of its feet rather than from heel to toe.

5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Louis</b> Philippe, the game's audio director, {{the team}} {{originally}} used intense music and sounds to create tension. However, the team decided to scrap this idea, {{realizing that the}} best way to create a tense atmosphere is to create the sounds of other players, which are often unexpected. The team created Navigation Sounds, in which the sound a player made is determined by their operators' weight, armor, and speed. Gadget deployment such as fortifying and breach-charging create louder sounds that may reveal the player's presence. The team thought that this would be enjoyable for players and influence their gameplay experience. The game's music was composed by Paul Haslinger, who had worked on the score of the previous Rainbow Six games and the Far Cry series. His co-composer was Ben Frost, who debuted his first video game soundtrack with Siege. Leon Purviance assisted Frost and Haslinger in composing the music.|$|E
5|$|After independence, modern {{buildings}} {{appeared in}} Ahmedabad. Architects given commissions {{in the city}} included Louis Kahn, who designed the IIM-A; Le Corbusier, who designed the Shodhan and Sarabhai Villas, the Sanskar Kendra and the Mill Owner's Association Building, and Frank Lloyd Wright, who designed the administrative building of Calico Mills and the Calico Dome. B. V. Doshi came to the city from Paris to supervise Le Corbusier's works and later set up the School of Architecture. His local works include Sangath, Amdavad ni Gufa and the School of Architecture. Charles Correa, who became a partner of Doshi's, designed the Gandhi Ashram and Achyut Kanvinde, and the Indian Textile Industries Research Association. Christopher Charles Benninger's first work, the Alliance Française, {{is located in the}} Ellis Bridge area.

5|$|As {{the decade}} progressed, Henry {{increasingly}} wanted {{to resolve the}} question of the inheritance. He decided that he would divide up his empire after his death, with Young Henry receiving England and Normandy, Richard being given the Duchy of Aquitaine, and Geoffrey acquiring Brittany. This would require the consent of Louis as king of France, and accordingly Henry and Louis held fresh peace talks in 1169 at Montmirail. The talks were wide-ranging, culminating with Henry's sons giving homage <b>to</b> <b>Louis</b> for their future inheritances in France, and with Richard being betrothed to Louis's daughter Alice.|$|E
