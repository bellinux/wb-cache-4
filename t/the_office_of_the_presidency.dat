Under {{the government of the}} Byelorussian SSR, the de facto leader of the Soviet Republic was the first secretaries of the Communist Party of Byelorussia, the only legal party in Soviet Belarus. From independence until passage of the Constitution in 1994, the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet was the head of state and the Prime Minister as the head of government. When <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> was created, the role of the prime minister was reduced to assisting the president and resulted in the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet, along with its Chairman, in 1996.|$|E

Taylor's cabinet, knowing this, resigned soon after. Webster {{was once again}} appointed Secretary of State, and he took office on July 23. With the Compromise unable to pass Congress as a whole, the parts were divided up and passed through separately, each receiving the support of moderates and partisans on either sides, with the votes of partisans {{on the other side}} being overruled. The bills were then signed into law by President Fillmore.|$|E
25|$|Women in Kosovo {{are women}} who live in or are from the Republic of Kosovo. As {{citizens}} of a post-war nation, some Kosovar (or Kosovan) women have become participants {{in the process of}} peace-building and establishing pro-gender equality in Kosovo's rehabilitation process. Women in Kosovo have also become active in politics and law enforcement in the Republic of Kosovo. An example of which is the election of Atifete Jahjaga as the fourth President of Kosovo, and as such she became the first female, the first non-partisan candidate, and the youngest to be elected to <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> in the country.

25|$|Despite {{being placed}} in a {{position}} to shape <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> via precedent, Hyde by and large opted for a quiet, conservative interpretation of the office. His age and health obligated him to schedule periods of rest throughout his days, and his lack of political experience caused him to defer to his advisers on questions of policy and discretionary powers, especially to his Secretary, Michael McDunphy. On 13 November 1938, just months after Hyde's inauguration, Hyde attended an international soccer match between Ireland and Poland at Dalymount Park in Dublin. This was seen as breaching the GAA's ban on 'foreign games' and he was subsequently removed as patron of the GAA, an honour he had held since 1902.|$|E

500|$|Because of {{his short}} tenure, Taylor is not {{considered}} to have strongly influenced <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidency</b> or the United States.

2500|$|In 1800, Jefferson {{was elected}} as President of the United States over Adams. He won more electoral votes than Adams, aided by {{southern}} power. The Constitution {{provided for the}} counting of slaves as 3/5ths of their total population, {{to be added to}} a state's total population for purposes of apportionment and the electoral college. [...] States with large slave populations, therefore, gained greater representation even though the number of voting citizens was smaller than that of other states. It was only due to this population advantage that Jefferson won the election. This advantage also aided southern states in their Congressional apportionment; thus, the planter class held disproportionate power nationally for decades, and southerners dominated <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> well into the 19th century.|$|E

2500|$|Also in {{that same}} year, on the Avenue de l'Observatoire in Paris, Mitterrand claimed to have escaped an assassin's bullet by diving behind a hedge, in {{what became known as}} the Observatory Affair. The {{incident}} brought him a great deal of publicity, initially boosting his political ambitions. Some of his critics claimed, however, that he had staged the incident himself, resulting in a backlash against Mitterrand. He later said he had earlier been warned by right-wing deputy Pesquet that he was the target of an AlgÃ©rie franÃ§aise death squad and accused Prime Minister Michel DebrÃ© of being its instigator. Before his death, Pesquet claimed that Mitterrand had set up a fake attempt on his life. Prosecution was initiated against Mitterrand but was later dropped. Nonetheless, the Observatory Affair cast a lasting shadow over Mitterrand's reputation. Years later in 1965, when Mitterrand emerged as the challenger to de Gaulle in the second round of the presidential elections, de Gaulle was urged by an aide to use the Observatory Affair to discredit his opponent. [...] "No, and don't insist" [...] was the General's response, [...] "It would be wrong to demean <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidency,</b> since one day he [...] may have the job." ...|$|E

In December 2006, a campus demonstration by Brotherhood students in uniforms, demonstrating martial arts drills, betrayed to some such as Jameel Theyabi [...] "the group's intent {{to plan for the}} creation of militia structures, and a return by the group to the era of 'secret cells'". Another report highlighted the Muslim Brotherhood's efforts in Parliament to combat what one member called the 'current US-led war against Islamic culture and identity', forcing the Minister of Culture (Farouk Hosny) to ban the publication of three novels on the ground they promoted blasphemy and unacceptable sexual practices. In October 2007, the Muslim Brotherhood issued a detailed political platform.
