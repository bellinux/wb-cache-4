5|$|The {{station has}} beige wall tiles with intertwining blue and orange stripes, {{representing}} the two {{colors of the}} New York City flag, and {{the colors of the}} IND Eighth Avenue and Sixth Avenue lines which serve the station. There are two fare control areas. The full-time area at the east end of the station, between 179th and 180th Streets, has a token booth and a bank of 12 <b>turnstiles</b> and two high-exit-only <b>turnstiles.</b> The part-time exit at 178th Street contains a nine-turnstile bank, two high exit entrance <b>turnstiles</b> (HEETs), and two high exit <b>turnstiles.</b> The two ends are connected by a full-length mezzanine, which features Our Spectrum of Support artwork by Reginald Polynice, a set of plywood cutout figures appearing to hold up the ceiling of the mezzanine. The station also features a control tower. The station is ADA-accessible via an elevator installed at 179th Place {{on the north side of}} Hillside Avenue.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} High Entry-Exit <b>Turnstiles</b> that allow {{entry to the}} station during late night hours, when the station booth is closed.|$|E
5|$|The stadium's clubhouse (named the Portway Suite) is also {{situated}} on this elevated side, {{just inside the}} <b>turnstiles.</b> The clubhouse houses a function suite and bar at first-floor level, and changing rooms, physio room, public announcement equipment, toilets and a tea bar at ground-floor level.|$|E
50|$|The {{drop arm}} optical <b>turnstile</b> is a {{combination}} of the security of a tripod or barrier <b>turnstile</b> and a fully optical <b>turnstile.</b> The lanes can have either single or double arms. When access is granted the arms drop into recesses in the cabinet. Once the arms drop out of the way, the <b>turnstile</b> functions as a fully optical <b>turnstile.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Shops {{and other}} {{businesses}} {{set up in the}} Great <b>Turnstile.</b> These included a bookseller, milliner, printer, sempster and shoemaker. [...] In 1829, Brayley says that the Great <b>Turnstile's</b> businesses then included a butcher, cutler, fruiterer, pastry-cook, tobacconist and manufacturer of bonnets, dresses and gloves, while the Little <b>Turnstile</b> had brokers and petty chandlers, and the New <b>Turnstile</b> had a variety of small shopkeepers.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, ground {{development}} {{continued with}} roofing enhancements to the North Stand {{and an increase}} in capacity to 31,500 by 1963. Dressing rooms were constructed in 1965 and new <b>turnstiles</b> were introduced two years later, including a separate entrance for juveniles at the Churchmans end. In 1968 the club agreed to a new 99-year lease on the ground with owners Ipswich Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|The other fare {{control area}} at the station's east (railroad north) end, {{accessed}} by a ramp to the platform, is unstaffed, containing full height <b>turnstiles</b> and two staircases {{going up to the}} northwest and southeast corners of East 205th Street and Perry Avenue. The token booth at this location was closed on July 30, 2005 and removed sometime afterward.|$|E
5|$|Previously, {{the club}} {{played at the}} Walled Meadow, near to the town centre. The ground had a main wooden stand along one side (which {{incorporated}} the changing rooms), and a bank of covered terracing on the opposite side. The ground was mainly accessed via the car park off London Road, with <b>turnstiles</b> also situated on Eastfield Road behind the main stand. Since the club left the Walled Meadow in 1989, the ground has been demolished and the site is now used for a housing development of the same name.|$|E
5000|$|In TeX, the <b>turnstile</b> symbol [...] is {{obtained}} from the command \vdash. In Unicode, the <b>turnstile</b> symbol (⊢) is called right tack and is at code point U+22A2. (Code point U+22A6 is named assertion sign (⊦).) On a typewriter, a <b>turnstile</b> can be composed from a vertical bar (|) and a dash (-). In LaTeX there is a <b>turnstile</b> package which issues this sign in many ways, and is capable of putting labels below or above it, in the correct places.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{implication}} and arrest of 15 employees (including <b>turnstile</b> operators, equipment mechanics and groundsmen), Everton introduced meticulously detailed gate books {{as well as}} new <b>turnstile</b> equipment.|$|R
50|$|During the season, {{attendance}} at the FedEx Forum for Tigers' games dropped significantly from prior years. The Commercial Appeal discovered via a FOIA request that the actual <b>turnstile</b> {{attendance at}} Tiger games had fallen below 6,000 by mid February. The Tigers had previously not announced <b>turnstile</b> attendance figures but rather used tickets sold as official attendance numbers. The <b>turnstile</b> attendance became an issue {{of interest in the}} City of Memphis for the Tigers' last three home games of the year because the Tigers' facility usage agreement with the Memphis Grizzlies specified that the Tigers receive an annual payment from the NBA franchise if their <b>turnstile</b> attendance averaged over 6,000 for the year. The Tigers ultimately did achieve an average <b>turnstile</b> attendance figure above 6,000 for the year.|$|R
5|$|The Rockaway-bound {{platform}} has two High Entry/Exit <b>Turnstiles</b> and one exit-only turnstile {{leading to}} a short staircase that goes down to the intersection of 159th Road and 103rd Street. The Brooklyn-bound platform has a set of emergency doors leading {{to the parking lot}} just north of the AirTrain JFK station; they are normally locked, but were in use from December 2012 to May 2013 as a connection to a temporary shuttle bus service instituted after Hurricane Sandy. Both platforms have stairs, escalators, and an elevator to the headhouse above the platforms.|$|E
5|$|The Stamford Bridge freehold, the pitch, the <b>turnstiles</b> and Chelsea's {{naming rights}} are {{now owned by}} Chelsea Pitch Owners, a {{non-profit}} organisation in which fans are the shareholders. The CPO was created to ensure the stadium could never again be sold to developers. As a condition for using the Chelsea FC name, the club has to play its first team matches at Stamford Bridge, which means that if the club moves to a new stadium, {{they may have to}} change their name.|$|E
5|$|A station {{house is}} located above both platforms, {{containing}} a crossover, waiting area and fare control. The single street staircase outside of fare control {{goes down to}} West Road by the intersection of Noel Road next to the Rockaway-bound platform. This platform also has a set of exit-only <b>turnstiles</b> leading directly to this staircase so riders exiting the station on this side {{do not have to}} go through the station house. The station house is heated, while the platforms feature passenger-activated heaters; these heaters, and the doors separating the station house and staircases, were not originally part of the station. The station house used to have 1950s-era signage at its front entrance reading, but now only has modern MTA entrance signs.|$|E
50|$|This {{station has}} a {{mezzanine}} with two separate <b>turnstile</b> banks. The northern <b>turnstile</b> bank leads to two staircases going to both northern corners of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street, and an elevator {{going to the}} NE corner of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street. The southern <b>turnstile</b> bank has two exits leading to both southern corners of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>turnstile</b> antenna {{was invented}} by George Brown in 1935 and {{described}} in scholarship in 1936. [...] The patent history reveals {{the popularity of the}} <b>turnstile</b> antenna over the years.|$|R
50|$|Both {{platforms}} have an unstaffed platform-level fare {{control at}} their north end, with no crossover. On the Church Avenue-bound side, one exit-only <b>turnstile</b> and one High Entry/Exit <b>Turnstile</b> {{lead to a}} single staircase {{going up to the}} northwest corner of Norman and Manhattan Avenues. On the Queens-bound side, a single full height <b>turnstile</b> leads to a staircase going up to the northeast corner of the same intersection.|$|R
5|$|Each {{platform}} has two same-level fare control areas, one {{at either}} end of the station, and there are no crossovers or crossunders. The full-time ones are at the north end and each has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to the northeast and southeast corners of Bergen and Smith Streets while those on the Coney Island-bound platform go up to the northwest and southwest corners. The fare control areas on the south end of the platforms are unstaffed, containing full height <b>turnstiles</b> and one street stair to the northeast corner of Warren and Smith Streets on the Manhattan-bound platform and the northwest corner for the Coney Island-bound platform. The south fare control area is more heavily used.|$|E
5|$|From the Lexington Avenue entrance, {{there are}} two short {{escalators}} and a stair from the northwest corner, a staircase from the southwest corner, and a short elevator hidden {{around the corner from}} the escalators. From the fare control, {{there are two}} long escalators and a stair to an intermediate level, and then two shorter escalators and a pair of stairs to a lower mezzanine. Here, the bank splits and there are two separate tubes of two escalators and a stair each to each platform. The platform elevator has its own two <b>turnstiles,</b> and makes three stops (mezzanine, upper platform, lower platform).|$|E
5|$|Fulfordgate did not {{initially}} have any covered stands, and the dressing rooms consisted {{of an old}} army hut, before open stands were bought from York Race Committee. The ground was gradually built up and improved, and covered accommodation was available after two years. In 1927, new <b>turnstiles</b> were installed and stronger fencing was built around the pitch, which {{made it more difficult}} for spectators to surmount it and access the pitch. Nine-tier terracing replaced the old banking behind one of the goals, the covered Popular Stand was extended to hold 1,000 supporters and there a small seated stand was erected.|$|E
40|$|A single-electron <b>turnstile</b> and {{electrometer}} circuit was fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator substrate. The <b>turnstile,</b> {{which is}} operated by {{opening and closing}} two metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) alternately, allows current quantization at 20 K due to single-electron transfer. Another MOSFET is placed at the drain side of the <b>turnstile</b> to form an electron storage island. Therefore, one-by-one electron entrance into the storage island from the <b>turnstile</b> can be detected as an abrupt change in the current of the electrometer, which is placed near the storage island and electrically coupled to it. The correspondence between the quantized current and the single-electron counting was confirmed...|$|R
5000|$|The full-height <b>turnstile</b> is {{a larger}} version of the <b>turnstile,</b> {{commonly}} 7 ft high, similar in operation to a revolving door, which eliminates the possibility (inherent in the waist-high style) of anyone jumping over the <b>turnstile.</b> However, this type of <b>turnstile</b> functions differently than a revolving door, in that it often does not allow someone to come in as someone else goes out. It is also pejoratively known as an [...] "iron maiden", after the torture device of the same name, or [...] "high-wheel". It is sometimes called a [...] "Rotogate", especially in Chicago, where it is used at unstaffed exits of Chicago 'L' stations, and is also used at many New York City Subway stations. In Europe, however, [...] "Rotogate" [...] refers to {{a different kind of}} gate that is not a <b>turnstile.</b>|$|R

5|$|In September 1978, the JFK Express began {{service and}} stopped at this station on racing days. The Aqueduct Specials ceased {{operation}} altogether in October 1981. At {{the time of their}} discontinuance the fare was $3, and it was being replaced by the more expensive $5 JFK Express fare. Between December 1991 and March 1992, after the JFK Express was discontinued, the Aqueduct Racetrack station was closed throughout the day, not reopening until the summer of 1997. The remaining service along the line would only be scheduled to stop on race days between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m., though some trains stopped here regardless of the time of day. In the summer of 1997 the station {{became one of the first}} in the system to have Metrocard-only High Entrance/Exit <b>Turnstiles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Increased {{service was}} {{provided}} during the 1960 spring meeting with Saturday and holiday service. During its first year, the service carried 341,000 riders. During the 1960s the extra fare was collected at special <b>turnstiles</b> {{at the three}} stations served by the special. Larger tokens were used. On July 5, 1966, the fare on the Aqueduct Special was raised to 75 cents. The fare was raised to $1 on January 4, 1970. The fare was raised from a $1 to $1.50 in February 1972. Later on the fare was lowered back to $1. The fare was raised back to $1.50 on June 28, 1980.|$|E
5|$|Small Heath Alliance {{played their}} first home games on waste ground off Arthur Street, Bordesley Green. As {{interest}} grew, {{they moved to}} a fenced-off field in Ladypool Road, Sparkbrook, where admission could be charged. A year later, they moved again, to a field adjoining Muntz Street, Small Heath, near the main Coventry Road, with a capacity of about 10,000. The Muntz Street ground was adequate for 1880s friendly matches, and the capacity was gradually raised to around 30,000, but when several thousand spectators scaled walls and broke down <b>turnstiles</b> {{to get into a}} First Division match against Aston Villa, it became clear that it could no longer cope with the demand.|$|E
40|$|A {{chemical}} <b>turnstile</b> is {{a device}} for transporting small, well-characterised doses of atoms from one location to another. A working <b>turnstile</b> {{has yet to}} be built, despite the numerous technological applications available for such a device. The key difficulty in manufacturing a chemical <b>turnstile</b> is finding a medium which will trap and transport atoms. Here we propose that ferroelastic twin walls are suitable for this role. Previous work shows that twin walls can act as two-dimensional trapping planes within which atomic transport is fast. We report simulations showing that a stress-induced reorientation of a twin wall can occur. This behaviour is ideal for chemical <b>turnstile</b> applications. Comment: 2 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the distribution of}} waiting times between electrons emitted from a periodically driven single-electron <b>turnstile.</b> To this end, we develop a scheme for analytic calculations of the waiting time distributions for arbitrary periodic driving protocols. We illustrate the general framework by considering a driven tunnel junction {{before moving on to}} the more involved single-electron <b>turnstile.</b> The waiting time distributions are evaluated at low temperatures for square-wave and harmonic driving protocols. In the adiabatic regime, the dynamics of the <b>turnstile</b> is synchronized with the external drive. As the non-adiabatic regime is approached, the waiting time distribution becomes dominated by cycle-missing events in which the <b>turnstile</b> fails to emit within one or several periods. We also discuss the influence of finite electronic temperatures. The waiting time distributions provide a useful characterization of the driven single-electron <b>turnstile</b> with complementary information compared to what can be learned from conventional current measurements.

5|$|Stations in {{the city}} center are located close to large {{employment}} centers as well as connection possibilities to other modes of transport, such as tram, rail and bus. All stations can be identified at ground level by signs with a blue T in a circle. Stations outside the center are unmanned since the 1995, with ticket machines for fare purchase; some stations feature kiosks. A system of <b>turnstiles</b> have been installed, but will never be activated due to security issues. All stations have step-free accessibility through at least one entrance (except the inbound platform at Frøen), and the platform height is aligned with the train cars.|$|E
5|$|The Bassett {{years of}} the late-50s to early-70s were marked by mediocrity on the field but {{consistent}} success at the <b>turnstiles.</b> An issue {{that has become a}} perennial concern in the city also emerged at this time: the possibility of a National Football League team in Toronto. Various machinations were entertained by Bassett including moving the Argos to the NFL, bringing an American expansion team to the city (e.g. the Toronto Northmen of the WFL), or expanding the CFL itself in the opposite direction. Other team owners steadfastly opposed Bassett's moves and almost rescinded his franchise in 1974; angered, he sold the team for $3.3 million to hotel magnate William R. Hodgson in the same year.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of the {{redevelopment}} involved the demolition of the North Stand, the concreting of all terraces and the building a block of <b>turnstiles</b> around the upper section of the East Terrace. This work, begun in October 1981 and completed in 1986, reduced the capacity to 74,370 and cost £3 million. A second phase had been planned to begin in 1988, but the release of the Taylor Report caused the plans to be redrawn and the proposed costs escalated to £25 million. Scotland hosted the 1989 FIFA Under-16 World Cup, with the Scots contesting the final against Saudi Arabia at Hampden.|$|E
50|$|On the {{northbound}} side, two staircases {{from the}} northeast corner of Longwood and Westchester Avenues go up to {{the north side of the}} station house, which has a now closed customer assistance booth, <b>turnstile</b> bank, waiting area, and doors leading directly to the platform. A high exit-only <b>turnstile</b> from the platform leads directly to the staircases.
