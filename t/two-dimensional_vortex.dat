5000|$|We {{note here}} {{some of the}} {{subtleties}} the established terminology. A rotating autowave in two-dimensional medium is called by various authors as spiral wave, reverberator, rotor, vortex or even scroll wave. However, one should {{take into account that}} these terms are not functionally interchangeable nevertheless (they are not entire synonyms). Briefly the differences between them are as follows.Ordinarily, the term [...] "spiral wave" [...] refers only to the autowaves rotating around a nonexcitable obstacle in the medium that is of sufficiently large size (that is, in this case, such extent, in which the obstacle is small compared with the size of the medium, and is, however, large enough to provide the autowave break). The tip of the spiral wave moves always along the border of the nonexcitable obstacles.The most important difference between an autowave reverberator and a close to it in the form spiral wave, which rotates around the obstacle, is that the reverberator is not tied to any structure in the medium. Due to this property reverberators can occur in different places of medium, not only in the absence of nonexcitable obstacles, but generally in a completely homogeneous medium (under appropriate initial conditions). In English scientific literature the most similar in meaning is the term [...] "rotor". However, we give preference to the term reverberator, although it is now less used (in English literature) than the term [...] "rotor", because it has two advantages being: 1) short enough and 2) not busy with other meaning (while the rotor is taken already to call the moving part of an electric motor, and, in addition, the term is used in the mathematical theory of the field). (...) As for the term [...] "autowave vortex", it can be asserted (at a some stretch, which is especially easy for mathematicians) that reverberator is a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>vortex</b> (and this is plain truth {{from the point of view}} of mathematics). For the natural sciences, which are also biophysics as well as modern medicine, two-dimensional objects do not exist in the real world, and therefore one can say only very conditionally about such two-dimensional objects in these sciences, implying that, in the context of the issues discussed, the thickness of the medium does not affect the behaviour of the phenomenon under consideration. Looking ahead, we say that a simple scroll is called a three-dimensional vortex that presents identical reverberators at any given time in each section perpendicular to its axis of rotation, and so its behaviour in each of the section is almost identical with behaviour of the reverberator. But this happens only in very limited circumstances, and, in common way, a simple scroll can easily be transformed into more complex objects. Therefore, the substitution of the terms [...] "scroll" [...] and [...] "reverberator" [...] in this case is completely irrelevant, and the term [...] "scroll", in opinion of the authors, is appropriate to use only for description of rotating autowaves in three-dimensional media — i.e., in the cases where you can not neglect the effects caused by the thickness of the medium.In light of these terminological remarks, we will write [...] "2D-autovortex" [...] ("two-dimensional autowave vortex") in the subsequent text, speaking generally about the autowaves rotating in two-dimensional medium and particularly, describing behaviour of 2D-autovortex, we will use the appropriate clarifying term - for example, [...] "spiral wave" [...] or [...] "reverberator".Отметим здесь же некоторые тонкости установившейся терминологии. Разные авторы называют вращающиеся в двумерной среде автоволны спиральными волнами (spiral wave), ревербераторами, роторами (rotor), автоволновыми вихрями (vortex) или даже свитками (scroll wave). Однако следует учитывать, что всё же эти термины не являются полными синонимами. Вкратце различия между ними следующие. Термином «спиральная волна» обозначают обычно лишь автоволны, вращающиеся вокруг невозбудимого препятствия в среде достаточно большой протяженности, то есть в данном случае такой протяженности, в которой препятствие является малым по сравнению с размером среды, однако достаточно большим, чтобы обеспечивать разрыв автоволны. В спиральной волне ее кончик движется по границе невозбудимого препятствия. Важнейшим отличием ревербератора от близкой к нему по форме спиральной волны, вращающейся вокруг отверстия, является то, что ревербератор не привязан к какой-либо структуре в среде. Благодаря этому свойству ревербераторы могут возникать в разных местах среды, причем не только при отсутствии невозбудимых препятствия, но и вообще в полностью однородной среде (при подходящих начальных условиях). В англоязычной литературе наиболее близким по смыслу является термин «ротор». Однако в своем изложении мы будем предпочтение отдавать термину ревербератор: хотя оно в настоящее время менее используется, чем термин «ротор», однако имеет два преимущества, одновременно являясь и достаточно коротким, и не занятым другими значениями (в то время как ротором, например, принято уже называть движущуюся часть электромотора, и, кроме того, этот термин широко используется в математической теории поля). (...) Что же до терминов «автоволновой вихрь», то с некоторыми натяжками (особенно легкими для математиков) можно утверждать, что ревербератор — это двумерный вихрь (и это с точки зрения математики абсолютно верно). Для естественных наук, каковыми являются и биофизика, и современная медицина, двумерных объектов не существует в реальном мире, и поэтому о двумерных объектах в этих науках говорят лишь очень условно, подразумевая при этом лишь то, что в контексте обсуждаемых вопросов толщина среды не сказывается на поведении рассматриваемого или изучаемого явления. Забегая вперед, скажем, что свитком (простым свитком) называют такой трехмерный вихрь, который в каждый момент времени в сечении, перпендикулярном своей оси вращения, являет собой идентичные ревербераторы, и поэтому его поведение в каждом из сечений практически тождественно поведению ревербератора. Но это происходит лишь в очень ограниченных условиях, а в остальных случаях простой свиток трансформируется в более сложные объекты. Поэтому в данном случае подмена терминов «свиток» и «ревербератор» является совершенно неуместной, и термин «свиток», по мнению авторов, уместно использовать лишь при описании автоволн, вращающихся в трехмерных средах, — то есть в тех случаях, когда нельзя пренебречь эффектами, обусловленными толщиной рассматриваемой среды. В свете этих терминологических замечаний мы в дальнейшем изложении, говоря вообще о вращающихся в двумерной среде автоволнах, будем использовать сокращение 2D-автовихрь (двумерный автоволновой вихрь), а в частных случаях описания поведения 2D-автовихря мы будем использовать соответствующий уточняющий термин: например, «спиральная волна» или «ревербератор».

40|$|A {{computational}} method is presented which describes the unsteady <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>vortex</b> generation and convection in stationary geometries with sharp edges. A second-order panel method {{is used to}} describe the motion of the <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>vortex</b> sheet, while the generation of vorticity at the sharp edges is enforced through a Kutta condition. In order to easily satisfy the normal-velocity boundary condition on the stationary walls, the flow domain is transformed to a half-plane (x 2 ̆ 6 gt; 0) by a Schwarz-Christoffel conformal mapping. In the computational plane the solid walls are situated on the vertical coordinate axis so that image vorticity can be utilized to satisfy the boundary condition in a simple way.
