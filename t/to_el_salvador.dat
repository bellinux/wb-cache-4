5|$|Takalik Abaj has various {{so-called}} Potbelly monuments representing obese {{human figures}} sculpted from large boulders, {{of a type}} found throughout the Pacific lowlands, extending from Izapa in Mexico <b>to</b> <b>El</b> <b>Salvador.</b> Their precise function is unknown but they appear to date from the Late Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} Takalik Abaj broke the ancient trade routes {{running along the}} Pacific coast from Mexico <b>to</b> <b>El</b> <b>Salvador,</b> these were {{replaced}} by a new route running up the Sierra Madre and into the northwestern Guatemalan highlands.|$|E
5|$|Finds {{from the}} site {{indicate}} contact with the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that shifted over time but allowed the city {{to participate in a}} trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico <b>to</b> <b>El</b> <b>Salvador.</b>|$|E

5|$|Potbelly sculptures are {{distributed}} along the Pacific slope of southern Mesoamerica from Chiapas in Mexico, through Guatemala <b>to</b> <b>El</b> <b>Salvador,</b> {{as well as}} in the Guatemalan highlands. A few examples have been found further afield in the Maya lowlands of Guatemala and Honduras. A ceramic potbelly figure was found as far away as Colha in northern Belize and has been dated to c.880600 BC, in the Middle Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} disturbance brought {{light to}} moderate rainfall <b>to</b> <b>El</b> <b>Salvador.</b> Many homes were damaged, roads were flooded, and several trees were downed. A 44-year-old woman died when a tree fell on her. Strong winds and high waves damaged four homes in Barrio Playa, in the municipality of Acajutla. As a result, shelters were opened, though only seven people sought refuge in them. This same disturbance brought landslides to Guatemala; consequently, 30 people moved to shelters.|$|E
5|$|On June 16, 2007, {{a rematch}} was {{scheduled}} between El Salvador and Hungary, {{the latter of}} which had delivered the biggest defeat <b>to</b> <b>El</b> <b>Salvador</b> in the national team's history. Many of the same players that had played the match between El Salvador and Hungary in the 1982 FIFA World Cup played again at the Estadio Cuscatlán. The stadium that filled 22,000 spectators saw a match tied at 2–2 with goals from Lázár Szentes and Ferenc Csongrádi for Hungary and two goals from Luis Ramírez Zapata for El Salvador.|$|E

5|$|The prickly shark {{is widely}} {{distributed}} around the Pacific Ocean. In {{the western and}} central Pacific, {{it has been reported}} off Japan, Taiwan, Victoria and Queensland in Australia, and New Zealand, as well as around the islands of Palau, New Caledonia, Tonga, Hawaii, and possibly the Gilberts. In the eastern Pacific, it is known to occur from Oregon <b>to</b> <b>El</b> <b>Salvador</b> (including the Gulf of California), around the Cocos and Galapagos Islands, and off Peru and Chile. This species generally seems to be uncommon; an exception is in Monterey Canyon off California, where sharks of both sexes are abundant throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|Sculptures of the Potbelly style {{are found}} {{all along the}} Pacific Coast from {{southern}} Mexico <b>to</b> <b>El</b> <b>Salvador,</b> as well as further afield at sites in the Maya lowlands. Although some investigators have suggested that this style is pre-Olmec, archaeological excavations on the Pacific Coast, including those at Takalik Abaj, have shown that this style began to be used {{at the end of}} the Middle Preclassic and reached its height during the Late Preclassic. The potbelly sculptures at Takalik Abaj all date to the Late Preclassic and are very similar to those at Monte Alto in Escuintla and Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|The Four Kings {{were very}} popular in Cuba, and the Japanese media were proud of the {{reputation}} they were bringing to judo and Japan. Consequently, on January 8, 1912, the Kodokan promoted Maeda to 5th dan. There was some resistance to this decision because there were those in Japan who did not approve of his involvement in professional wrestling. In 1913, Tokugoro Ito stayed in Cuba while Maeda and Satake went <b>to</b> <b>El</b> <b>Salvador,</b> Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In El Salvador, the president was assassinated while Maeda was there, and in Panama, the Americans tried to pay him to lose; in response, they kept moving south. In Peru they met Laku, a Japanese jujutsuka who taught the military, and invited him to join them. They were then joined by Okura in Chile, and by Shimitsu in Argentina. The troupe arrived in Brazil on November 14, 1914.|$|E

5|$|In the World Cup finals El Salvador {{was drawn}} into a group with Belgium, Mexico, and the Soviet Union. El Salvador lost their first game 3–0 to Belgium in Mexico City on June 3. The second match was played against the host nation, Mexico, on 7 June. The game was decided by a {{controversial}} call {{near the end of}} the first half, with the score still at 0–0. Egyptian referee Hussain Kandil awarded a free kick <b>to</b> <b>El</b> <b>Salvador</b> in their own half. However, a Mexican player took the free-kick, passing to another Mexican player who scored. The Salvadoran players protested vigorously, to the extent of physically jostling Bermudan linesman Keith Dunstan, but the goal was allowed to stand. El Salvador restarted the game by kicking the ball into the crowd in protest. They eventually lost the game 4–0. The team's third and final game occurred on June 10 with El Salvador losing 2–0 to the Soviet Union in Mexico City, to finish at the bottom of Group A with 0 points.|$|E
5|$|A 2010 {{study by}} Delton Hanson and colleagues used DNA {{sequence}} {{data from the}} mitochondrial gene cytochrome b (Cytb) and two nuclear markers, exon 1 of the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein gene (Rbp3) and intron 2 of alcohol dehydrogenase gene 1 (Adh1-I2) to study relationships among populations of the marsh rice rat and O.couesi. The Cytb data placed all studied specimens of O.couesi in a clade sister to the marsh rice rat; the mean genetic distance {{between the two groups}} was 11.30%, much larger than the distance between sister species in the related genera Melanomys and Nectomys (7.48% and 7.52%, respectively). Within the O.couesi clade, two populations from Panama and Costa Rica were successively basal to the other specimens, which fell into two large subclades—one containing animals from the Pacific seaboard from western Mexico <b>to</b> <b>El</b> <b>Salvador</b> and the other containing rats from the eastern seaboard from Texas to Nicaragua. The Panamanian and Costa Rican populations differed by 6.53% to 11.93% from the others and the western and eastern subclades differed by 4.41% on average. Data from both of the slower-evolving nuclear markers Rbp3 and Adh1-I2 also placed examples of Oryzomys in two main clades, but did not recover the western and eastern groups of O.couesi as separate clades. In addition, Adh1-I2 placed the Costa Rican population within the marsh rice rat clade and placed some western O.couesi specimens closer to the marsh rice rat than to the O.couesi group. The combined dataset supported the western and eastern clades within O.couesi and placed the Costa Rican population marginally closer to the marsh rice rat than to O.couesi. Using the genetic species concept, the authors suggested that the four groups they found within O.couesi should be recognized as distinct species. If this suggestion is followed, the eastern subclade would retain the name Oryzomys couesi, the western group would be named Oryzomys mexicanus, and the appropriate names for the Panamanian and Costa Rican species remain unclear.|$|E
