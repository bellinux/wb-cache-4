50|$|Fruehauf Trailer Corporation, {{previously}} Fruehauf Trailer Company (1918-1963) and Fruehauf Corporation (1963-1989), was an American company {{engaged in}} the manufacture and sale of truck trailers, and other machinery and equipment, with headquarters located in Detroit, Michigan. It was founded in 1918 in Detroit, after August Fruehauf created the semi-trailer and launched a new industry. The Fruehauf trailer company introduced revolutionary inventions to trucking and transportation with hydraulic dump trailers, bulk <b>tanker</b> <b>trailers,</b> and automatic fifth wheel coupling among their over one thousand patents, including the shipping container in 1956. Expanding across the country, Fruehauf had 16 plants and over 80 distributorships for parts and service. Globally, the company expanded into Europe, South America and Asia. Following a proxy battle in the late 1980s the company filed for bankrupt protection in 1997. International divisions became independent, U.S. subsidiaries like Kelsey Hayes, Pro-Par, Budd Wheels and Hobbs were sold; Wabash National acquired the crippled company in 1997.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, the ZIM {{navigation}} company Europe Lines {{were approached}} {{to help in}} providing fuel, once the boats had left Cherbourg. Assistance was provided by Edmond Wilhelm Brillant, a retired navy officer and a naval architect. He designated MV Lea to provide fuel at Gibraltar and MV Nahariya as a backup in the Bay of Biscay (both general cargo ships that were available at that time). The main difficulty {{at this stage of}} the plan was the conversion of MV Lea into a fuelling ship carrying 200,000 litres of light diesel fuel. This was solved by conversion of the ballast tank in the ship's bow and bottom into a fuel tank. The pump system was converted to operate as both a fire fighting and fueling pump. Special high pressure hoses were used and a fueling drill was developed prior sailing to the rendezvous point near Gibraltar. According to international maritime regulations, MV Lea could not sail since safety regulations banned ships from carrying fuel in the bow as fuel vapour may cause an explosion. This issue was solved by Brillant with the aid of Kirstine shipyards and a Lloyd's Register surveyor. Additionally, a special filter was needed to make sure no dirt from tanks would contaminate the boat's tanks and engines. This filter was improvised by Brillant. It was capable of fuelling five boats, but only two at a time were fueled at the ship's stern. The overall conversion and drill took twelve hours. Other Zim divisions provided the Dan, a Ro-Ro ship sister of MV Nili which would provide fuel near Lampedusa. Captain of MV Dan was Yosef Dror, a retired Navy officer (Commander) and Shayetet 13 commando frogman. In this case, <b>tanker</b> <b>trailers</b> were loaded in the ship's garage. These Zim ships sailed with additional crew made up of members of the Israeli Navy.|$|E

40|$|At {{space vehicle}} launch {{sites such as}} Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB), Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) and Kennedy Space Center (KSC), toxic vapors and {{hazardous}} liquid wastes result from the handling of commodities (hypergolic fuels and oxidizers), most notably from transfer operations where fuel and oxidizer are transferred from bulk storage tanks or transfer tankers to space launch vehicles. During commodity transfer at CCAFS and KSC, wet chemical scrubbers (typically containing four scrubbing towers) are used to neutralize fuel saturated vapors from vent systems on tanks and <b>tanker</b> <b>trailers.</b> For fuel vapors, a citric acid solution is used to scrub {{out most of the}} hydrazine. Operation of both the hypergolic fuel and oxidizer vapor scrubbers generates waste scrubber liquor. Currently, scrubber liquor from the fuel vapor scrubber is considered non-hazardous. The scrubber liquor is defined as spent citric acid scrubber solution; the solution contains complexed hydrazine I methylhydrazine and is used to neutralize nonspecification hypergolic fuel generated by CCAFS and KSC. This project is a collaborative effort between Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Space and Missile Center (SMC), the CCAFS, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to evaluate microwave destruction technology for the treatment of non-specification hypergolic fuel generated at CCAFS and KSC. The project will capitalize on knowledge gained from microwave treatment work being accomplished by AFSPC and SMC at V AFB. This report focuses on the costs associated with the current non-specification hypergolic fuel neutralization process (Section 2. 0) as well as the estimated costs of operating a mobile microwave unit to treat non-specification hypergolic fuel (Section 3. 0), and compares the costs for each (Section 4. 0). The purpose of this document is to assess the costs associated with waste hypergolic fuel.

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsArlo BiereThe {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to examine the}} factors that a producer will want to consider when choosing the milk cooling and storage system for the dairy farm. The two systems studied are the traditional, on-farm, bulk tank system and the more recently developed, direct tanker loading system that uses glycol chilling plates. As a long-term investment, the choice of the refrigeration and storage system {{will have an impact on}} at least four dimensions of the dairy business. The capital cost of the milk cooling/storage system can range from 2 % to 5 % of the total capital investment in the farm. Milk cooling costs can also account for as much as 25 % of the farm’s total electric costs. The system selected can also have an impact on the hauling charges and the hauling charges can account for as much as 10 % of the dairy’s gross revenue. Lastly, the storage system selected may influence the range of markets available to the producer as not all processors accept milk from farms using direct tanker loading. Using an economic engineering approach, three hypothetical farm sizes were considered: milking 700, milking 1, 400, and milking 2, 100 cows. Capital and operating cost data were collected from three major dairy equipment manufacturers that service the Upper Midwest. Capital expenses for each size farm were priced for conventional bulk tanks and then also priced for glycol plate chiller systems that load directly into <b>tanker</b> <b>trailers.</b> The comparison of annualized costs of ownership for all three farm sizes shows only minor differences in the two systems. For the 700 cow farm, a direct tanker loading system saved 0. 24 % over the total capital investment; for the 1, 400 cow farm, a direct tanker loading system saved 0. 97 %; and for the 2, 100 cow farm, a direct tanker loading system saved 1. 19 %. Thus, differences in hauling charges, which will vary with each situation, become critical to the choice. Because the overall cost of the two systems are so close, one can expect that the peripheral and non-economic issues may be much more influential on each producer’s decision. Given the known differences in hauling charges, one can conclude that for the 700 cow farm, conventional tanks would be the preferred choice. For the 1, 400 cow farm and the 2, 100 cow farm, the determining factors come down to the differences in hauling charges and long-term goals for the farm business...|$|E

40|$|River Terrace {{characterizes the}} daily {{life of the}} people in the {{pastoral}} town of Uenohara where Teikyo University of Science and Technology (TUST) was established in 1990. The author of this article was invited to lecture in the Management Engineering Department on industry and business economics based on his knowledge and experience as an industrial economist and a member of the corporate staff involved in promoting the commercialization of new products of Toray Industries Inc., an innovative company in the polymer science field. A few years after joining TUST, he began to realize the relentless depopulation of the remote areas of the town caused by the aging population and declining birthrate. He started to investigate ways to meet the challenges and help maintain the quality of life in this pastoral community. The first step was to count the total number of vehicles over a twenty- four hour period, both on weekdays and at weekends, not only big dump trucks, road <b>tankers,</b> <b>trailers</b> and buses but also passenger cars, commercial vehicles and very small family cars that passed in both directions along National Route 20, where people are unable to do their daily shopping without the risk of a traffic accident. The number of vehicles passing every ten minutes was reported to the municipal authorities and a plan to build a tunnel was proposed so that traffic could pass through the town but bypass the main shopping street. The second step was to count the total number of passengers using trains at JR Uenohara Station in both directions from the first train at 5 : 20 to the last train at 24 : 50, to know the exact number and direction of travelers every ten minutes both on weekdays and at weekends. These data were also reported to the municipal authorities and a plan was proposed for a new bus terminal in front of the south exit of the station. The author found these two proposals were shelved owing to an insufficient municipal budget and administrative regulations and so he became determined to take the opportunity to bring his ideas to the Koizumi Kouzoukaikaku platform hoping to open the window on improving the Quality of Life in this pastoral town of Uenohara. His first idea was to set up a "car-sharing scheme" based on a dating site system to let those people with almost no private transportation get a lift easily and legally by asking neighbors and by paying, not in legal tender, but inprivate local community currency. His second idea was to allow the divisional ownership of land for the first time in Japan just like those legalized in the case of an individual residence within a condominium. The author has observed over the last fifteen years that very large spaces in front of the south exit have not been utilized efficiently not only in terms of people 2 ̆ 7 s QOL but also with regard to municipal design and development. These two proposals were ranked "D" by government officials, which means they could be put into practice immediately under the existing laws and no new specific Kouzoukaikaku regulations would be necessary...|$|R

40|$|Issues {{related to}} global warming have moved {{hydrogen}} into the spotlight as a promising energy carrier. As hydrogen is considered as a promising energy carrier from concerns driven by global warming, {{the goal of this}} work was a development and optimization of an integrated modelling and optimization of hydrogen energy network for Texas. To achieve such goal, the hydrogen energy network formulation based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) was performed. In the hydrogen energy network, five raw materials and three electricity potential sources were introduced, and they highly affected on the technology availability when they are depleted. Hydrogen was produced from technologies such as SMR, coal and biomass gasification, and alkaline/PEM/solid oxide electrolysis. The produced hydrogen was compressed or liquefied to be ready for use. The produced hydrogen was sold at $ 5 /kg, and could be transported from one region to other through tube <b>trailers,</b> <b>tanker</b> trucks, tube railcars, and tank railcars to maximize the profit and meet hydrogen demand. Lastly, some possible scenarios were tested such as discounting electricity price scenarios and limiting raw material availability. When electricity price was reduced, there were technology transitions from SMR to the electrolysis at some geographical regions. Additionally, the electricity price discount triggered an increase in hydrogen autonomy of each geographical region as it decreased the amount of hydrogen transported. When the fossil fuel based raw material availability was gradually reduced over time period according to Horizon 2020, there were increased raw material transportations as the raw materials depleted faster in some geographical regions at certain time periods. The combined scenarios regarding both electricity price and raw material limitation were also tested, and it showed the competence of two technologies, biomass gasification and solid oxide electrolysis, as both required natural gas which was limited...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the unique pneumatic test {{requirements for the}} acoustic and shock separation testing of the Second Stage for the new Delta III Rocket at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The testing was conducted in the 45, 000 cu ft (25 -feet wide by 30 -feet deep by 50 -foot high) Acoustic Facility. The acoustic testing required that the liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (LH 2) tanks be filled with enough liquid nitrogen (LN 2) to simulate launch fuel masses during testing. The challenge for this test dealt with designing, procuring, and fabricating the pneumatic supply systems for quick assembly while maintaining the purity requirements and minimizing costs. The pneumatic systems were designed to fill and drain the both LOX and LH 2 tanks {{as well as to}} operate the fill/drain and vent valves for each of the tanks. The test criteria for the pneumatic sub-systems consisted of function, cleanliness, availability, and cost. The first criteria, function, required the tanks to be filled and drained in an efficient manner while preventing them from seeing pressures greater than 9 psig which would add a pressure cycle to the tank. An LN 2 tanker, borrowed from another NASA facility, served as the pre-cool and drain tanker. Pre-cooling the tanks allowed for more efficient and cost effective transfer from the LN 2 delivery tankers. Helium gas, supplied from a high purity tube trailer, was used to pressurize the vapor space above the LN 2 pushing it into the drain <b>tanker.</b> The tube <b>trailer</b> also supplied high pressure helium to the vehicle for valve control and component purges. Cleanliness was maintained by proper component selection, end-use particle filtration, and any on-site cleaning determined necessary by testing. In order to meet the availability/cost juggling act, products designed for LOX delivery systems were procured to ensure system compatibility while off the shelf valves and tubing designed for the semiconductor industry were procured for the gas systems...|$|R
