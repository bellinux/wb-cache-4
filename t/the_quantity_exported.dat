Although there was some work involved in planting the seeds, and cultivating or holding out the weeds, the critical labor input for cotton was in the picking. How much a cotton operation could produce depended on how many hands (men women and children) were available. Finally in the 1950s, new mechanical harvesters allowed a handful of workers to pick as much as 100 had done before. The result was a large-scale exodus of the white and black cotton farmers from the south. By the 1970s, most cotton was grown in large automated farms in the Southwest.|$|E

We find an evolving policy environment leading to structural changes in the export sector, including an elimination of vertical integration for most exporters. Ethiopia’s coffee export earn-ings improved dramatically over this period, i. e. a four-fold real increase. This has mostly been due to increases in international market prices.

40|$|In {{a system}} in which {{fertilization}} is recommended, diagnosis of soil K availability and the establishment of critical levels are made difficult by the possibility of a contribution of non-exchangeable forms of K for plant nutrition. Due to its magnitude, this contribution is well diagnosed in long term experiments and in those which compare fertilization systems with positive and negative balances in terms of replacement of the K extracted by plants. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate K availability in a Hapludalf under fertilization for sixteen years with the addition of K doses. The study was undertaken in an experiment set up in 1991 and carried out until 2007 in the experimental area of the Soil Department of the Federal University of Santa Maria (Universidade Federal de Santa Maria - UFSM), in Santa Maria (RS), Brazil. The soil was a Typic Hapludalf submitted to four doses of K (0, 60, 120 and 180 kg ha- 1 K 2 O) and subdivided in the second year, when 60 kg ha- 1 of K 2 O were reapplied in the subplots in 0, 1, 2 and 3 times. As of the fifth year, the procedure was repeated. Grain yield above ground dry matter and total K content contained in the plant tissue were evaluated. Soil samples were collected, oven dried, ground, passed through a sieve and submitted to exchangeable K analysis by the Mehlich- 1 extractor; non-exchangeable K by boiling HNO 3 1 mol L- 1 and total K by HF digestion. Potassium fertilization guidelines should foresee the establishment of a critical level as of which the recommended dose should accompany crop needs, which coincides with <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>exported</b> by the grain, without there being the need for the creation of broad ranges of K availability to predict K fertilization.

40|$|Lychee on the European markets. With {{approximately}} 2. 8 Mt {{of annual}} global production, lychee constitutes a minor fruit {{in terms of}} production. The world production is mainly located in the northern hemisphere (95 %). However, most of <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>exported</b> to the EU comes from the southern hemisphere. In this context, with its 100, 000 t of annual production, Madagascar is ranked fourth in the producing world and first in the southern hemisphere producing countries. This rank {{is due to the}} fact that supplies in the EU are seasonal and mainly concentrated during the end of the year holiday season. This market can only be supplied in quantity by the Malagasy lychee because of its earlier date of harvest in the Indian Ocean. The lychee industry in Madagascar. Lychee cultivation in Madagascar dates from the early twentieth century. It is primarily grown in wet tropical lowlands of the island with some production in areas with a subtropical climate with dry and cool winters. The stand is not structured into orchards. Therefore, the volumes currently exported are based on a stand established by a multitude of small producers. The characteristics of Malagasy lychee export and the consequences of the production context on export are analyzed. Changes in European legislation on lychee importation. The regulatory changes since 1987 and the commercial developments since 1994 are reviewed by analyzing the resulting effects on the Malagasy lychee exports. Learning experience from fifteen years of Malagasy lychee export campaigns. Data on Malagasy lychee export campaigns from 1996 to 2012 and the history of the changes in volumes exported allow a close analysis of the factors affecting the Malagasy lychee industry. Success factors of the Malagasy lychee exports. These factors are related to securing market position and to the components of a marketing campaign (supply date to the European market, exported volumes and competition from produce from other countries). Conclusions. Lychees from Madagascar, although marketed for a very brief period, currently occupy the first rank on the European markets and have managed, through the development of transport logistics using very large-capacity cargoes, to eliminate all competition. However, this sector is mainly structured downstream and its production, which comprises a network of 30, 000 small producers, has been neglected. This lack of intervention (boosting of production, improving crop management, etc.) upstream of the chain does not support sustaining the industry in the medium term. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
30|$|The {{interpretation}} of the sign obtained for the geometric mean of direct connections variable and the smallest number of carriers operating on any leg of a maritime route variable is not necessarily intuitive. Both variables {{are found to be}} negatively related to bilateral exports in the joint components estimation. As mentioned previously the Geom_Mean_Direct_C variable is found to affect positively bilateral exports when its impact is assessed separately from other components. The switch in sign when estimated jointly may be the consequence of the very high correlation existing between the latter variable and the Common_direct_C variable rather than an economic mechanism strictly speaking. However, if the latter variable is removed from the joint estimation then the Geom_Mean_Direct_C does enter positively in the estimation but its effect loses significance. Both variables are a reflection of the country pair in the network of maritime connections. However, while the Common_direct_C variable is a proper bilateral variable capturing the true degree of interconnectivity between the two countries, the Geom_Mean_Direct_C is bilateral only by construction and may instead capture the degree of diversification of each country forming the pair in the maritime network. This could explain both the opposite signed observed when these two variables are included in the same specification {{and the fact that the}} coefficient of Geom_Mean_Direct_C is not precisely estimated when included alone with the remaining three LSBCI components. The negative sign observed for the coefficient of Carriers could also be problematic in interpreting. We expect a larger number of companies operating on any leg of a maritime route to be synonymous of more competition on the market of maritime services and eventually in lower freight costs. Data used for bilateral exports are in cif units meaning that any change in the cost of freight is directly transmitted to exports values. This possibly direct pass-through effect may dominate any demand side effect that could lead to an increase in the value of exports. Indeed the relative change in the value of exports is equal to the relative change in <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>exported</b> plus the relative change in price. The relative change in quantity cannot be unequivocally estimated for aggregate export data as it is necessary to determine a common unit to significantly different quantities. If we take the quantity effect to be close to zero due to some lags in the reaction of the demand to changes in prices, the estimated coefficient can be seen as a pure price effect. The obtained sign would then be consistent with expectations about the relationship between competition amongst shipping companies and the cost of freight. The estimate could then be interpreted to suggest that adding one carrier on the least competitive leg of a maritime route would decrease the cost of freight by about 2 %. Results (not reported) obtained by implementing a Poisson estimator are similar both qualitatively and quantitatively for all variables except once again the Colony and the Currency ones.|$|E

With the liberalization of Indian economy and establishment of WTO it was expected that the WTO regime would increase the price level in the international market due to implementation of proposed heavy cut in agricultural subsidies by the developed countries and hence the export of potatoes from India may get a boost. Under this backdrop, the study has ascertained the effect of establishment of WTO on export of potatoes from India. The study has indicated a declining export competitiveness of Indian potatoes in the post-WTO era, which requires immediate attention of policymakers as well as researchers in India to improve the export competitiveness by increasing the productivity and decreasing the cost of production. A need has been emphasized on giving some export incentives and easing some of the major infrastructural bottlenecks. Frozen-potatoes export from India had depicted competitiveness in the post-WTO era which can be encouraged to capture the fast expanding market of the product.

The automotive industry is highly interconnected and barriers could severely impact the supply chain networks of automotive manufacturers. The topic was of particular interest due to the estimated implications of the Brexit and the substantial passenger car <b>quantities</b> that Germany <b>exports.</b> Methodology. The authors studied the current market structure {{through the use of}} a double-logarithmic gravity equation. The gravity model provided the foundation for a quantitative forecasting model which projected future trade quantities under different Brexit scenarios. The model was based on a sample representing 98 per cent of Germany’s total <b>export</b> <b>quantity</b> of passenger cars. Diagnostic tests suggest that the model was robust and efficient in estimating trade quantities. Findings. All Brexit scenarios were estimated to negatively impact <b>the</b> <b>export</b> <b>quantities</b> of passenger cars from Germany to the UK. Lower tariffs were projected to benefit <b>export</b> <b>quantities</b> of passenger cars from Germany, nevertheless, a weaker economy in the UK due to the Brexit is estimated to reduce demand for passenger cars and offset the benefits of trading with low tariffs. The most pessimistic scenario in 2030 forecasts a reduction of 15, 4 per cent in exported cars compared to a scenario in the absence of the Brexit. Originality.

We used autovial microcolumns incubated for a period ranging between 0 and 156 days. Our results showed that {{a large proportion of}} radioactivity remained extractable by methanol up to 64 days of incubation, amounting from 44. 5 to 80. 2 % of initial radioactivity. Mineralisation of 14 C-phenanthrene began tardily, after the decrease of mineralisation of the soil organic matter. Throughout incubation, mineralisation remained slow and weak, of co-metabolic type, and only 2 % of <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> applied was mineralised over a period of 156 days. The amount of radioactivity leached varied considerably during incubation. Under {{the effect of}} water percolation of 64 mm, <b>the</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>exported</b> in equivalent 14 C-phenanthrene went from 0. 90 to 0. 48 ng/g of soil between 0 and 35 days, then increased up to 1. 5 ng/g at 100 days. The radioactivity present in pore water displayed the same dynamic and the same variations. For pore water, this radioactivity represented, in equivalent phenanthrene, 0. 09 ng/g of soil up to 46 days, then increased rapidly to reach 0. 5 ng/g at 65 days. In both cases (leachates and pore water), enrichment in radioactivity due to the presence of a high proportion of polar compounds reached 89 %. Lastly, the formation of non-extractable residues progressed very slowly up to 45 days (5. 9 to 13 % of the amount applied), after which there was a marked increase, i. e. to 20. 7, 32. 2 and 35. 8 % at 52, 64 and 156 days, respectively. These increases in radioactivity in different compartments of soil are correlated with mineralisation of phenanthrene due to preliminary production of degradation products. Thus, the capacity of a soil to degrade and mineralise phenanthrene plays a determining role in the distribution of its residues between the soil solution and the solid matrix. Overall, our results suggest that in agricultural soils contaminated by strongly adsorbed organic compounds, water pollution and sequestration are primarily controlled by degradation...|$|R
