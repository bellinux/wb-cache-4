The space of DTL reconciliations and their parsimony costs—which can be extremely vast for large multi-copy gene family trees—can be efficiently explored through dynamic programming algorithms. In some programs, the gene <b>tree</b> <b>topology</b> can be refined where it was uncertain to fit a better evolutionary scenario {{as well as the}} initial sequence alignment. More refined models account for the biased frequency of HGT between closely related lineages, reflecting the loss of efficiency of HR with phylogenetic distance, for ILS, or {{for the fact that the}} actual donor of most HGT belong to extinct or unsampled lineages. Further extensions of DTL models are being developed towards an integrated description of the genome evolution processes. In particular, some of them consider horizontal at multiple scalesmodelling independent evolution of gene fragments or recognising co-evolution of several genes (e.g., due to co-transfer) within and across genomes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: There {{are several}} {{models for the}} {{evolutionary}} process forming a species tree. We examine the Birth-and-Death model (BDM), the Proportional-to-Distinguish-able Arrangements (PDA) model, the Kirkpatrick and Slatkin (KS) model, the Beta-Splitting (BS) model and a model where birth rates evolve according to a Geometric Brownian Motion Process (GBM). For testing and calibrating the models, we evaluate <b>tree</b> <b>topologies</b> from TreeBASE and a large tree provided by the Tree of Life project. In a simulation we compare the distribution of <b>tree</b> <b>topologies</b> generated by the models with <b>tree</b> <b>topologies</b> of observed <b>trees.</b> For describing the distribution of topologies we use the tree imbalance statistics B 1, Colless’C and Shao and Sokal’s N, and calculate the maximum-likelihood estimate of β from the BS model. Further we explore the splitting pattern of the generated trees. From the observed trees we show that trees generated by the BDM are too balanced and trees generated by the PDA model are too imbalanced. The BS model with β=− 1, the KS model with ratio 1 : 2 and an adjusted GBM model represent better fitted models for reproducing the imbalance in observed <b>tree</b> <b>topologies.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —Bayesian phylogenetic {{analyses}} are now {{very popular in}} systematics and molecular evolution because they allow the use of much more realistic models than currently possible with maximum likelihood methods. There are, however, {{a growing number of}} examples in which large Bayesian posterior clade probabilities are associated with very short edge lengths and low values for non-Bayesian measures of support such as nonparametric bootstrapping. For the four-taxon case when the true tree is the star phylogeny, Bayesian analyses become increasingly unpredictable in their preference for one of the three possible resolved <b>tree</b> <b>topologies</b> as data set size increases. This leads to the prediction that hard (or near-hard) polytomies in nature will cause unpredictable behavior in Bayesian analyses, with arbitrary resolutions of the polytomy receiving very high posterior probabilities in some cases. We present a simple solution to this problem involving a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that allows exploration of all of tree space, including unresolved <b>tree</b> <b>topologies</b> with one or more polytomies. The reversible-jump MCMC approach allows prior distributions to place some weight on less-resolved <b>tree</b> <b>topologies,</b> which eliminates misleadingly high posteriors associated with arbitrary resolutions of hard polytomies.

25|$|In fiber-optic communication, {{the path}} {{coloring}} {{problem is the}} problem of assigning colors (frequencies of light) to pairs of nodes that wish to communicate with each other, and paths through a fiber-optic communications network for each pair, subject to the restriction that no two paths that share a segment of fiber use the same frequency as each other. Paths that pass through the same communication switch but not through any segment of fiber are allowed to use the same frequency. When the communications network is arranged as a star network, with a single central switch connected by separate fibers to each of the nodes, the path coloring problem may be modeled exactly as a problem of edge coloring a graph or multigraph, in which the communicating nodes form the graph vertices, pairs of nodes that wish to communicate form the graph edges, and the frequencies that may be used for each pair form the colors of the edge coloring problem. For communications networks with a more general <b>tree</b> <b>topology,</b> local path coloring solutions for the star networks defined by each switch in the network may be patched together to form a single global solution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{successful}} {{deployment of}} multicast in the Internet requires {{the availability of}} good network management solutions. Discovering multicast <b>tree</b> <b>topologies</b> {{is an important component}} of this task. Network managers can use topology information to monitor and debug potential multicast forwarding problems. In addition, the collected topology has several other uses, for example, in reliable multicast transport protocols, in multicast congestion control protocols, and in discovering network characteristics. In this paper, we present a mechanism for discovering multicast <b>tree</b> <b>topologies</b> using forwarding state in the network. We call our approach tracetree. First, we present the basic operation of tracetree. Then, we explore various issues (e. g., scalability, security, etc.) related to its design and deployment of tracetree. Next, we provide a detailed evaluation by comparing it to the currently available alternatives. Finally, we discuss a number of deployment issues. We believe that tracetree provides an efficient and scalable mechanism for discovering multicast <b>tree</b> <b>topologies</b> and therefore fills an important void in the area of multicast network management...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper studies {{continuity}} of the normal form and the context operators as functions in the infinitary lambda calculus. We consider the Scott topology on the cpo of the finite and infinite terms with the prefix relation. We prove that the only continuous parametric trees are Böhm and Lévy–Longo trees. We also prove a general statement: if the normal form function is continuous then so is the model induced by the normal form; {{as well as the}} converse for parametric trees. This allows us to deduce that the only continuous models induced by the parametric trees are the ones of Böhm and Lévy–Longo trees. As a first application, we prove that there is an injective embedding from the infinitary lambda calculus of the ∞η-Böhm trees in D∞. As a second application, we study the relation between the Scott topology on the prefix relation and the <b>tree</b> <b>topologies.</b> This allows us to prove that the only parametric <b>tree</b> <b>topologies</b> in which all context operators are continuous and the approximation property holds are the ones of Böhm and Lévy–Longo. As a third application, we give an explicit characterisation of the open sets of the Böhm and Lévy–Longo <b>tree</b> <b>topologies.</b> ...|$|R

Most existing methods share the drawback of requiring {{a complete and}} exact mapping of terminal nodes between the compared trees. This severely limits the scope of genome-wide analyses, since trees containing duplications are pruned arbitrarily or discarded. To overcome this, we have developed treeKO, an algorithm that enables the comparison of <b>tree</b> <b>topologies,</b> even {{in the presence of}} duplication and loss events. To do so treeKO recursively splits gene trees into pruned trees containing only orthologs to subsequently compute a distance based on the combined analyses of all pruned tree comparisons.

25|$|Reconciliation of {{gene and}} species trees entails mapping {{evolutionary}} events onto gene trees {{in a way}} that makes them concordant with the species tree.

More recent ones also account for duplication (D), loss (L), incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) or homologous recombination (HR) events. The difficulty is that by allowing for multiple types of events, the number of possible reconciliations increases rapidly. For instance, a conflicting gene <b>tree</b> <b>topologies</b> might be explained in terms of a single HGT event or multiple duplication and loss events. Both alternatives can be considered plausible reconciliation depending on the frequency of these respective events along the species tree.|$|R

The <b>tree</b> <b>topologies</b> associated with the most highly conserved genes suggest that the endosymbionts form a sister group with Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., and Yersinia pestis. Our results indicate that deviant <b>tree</b> <b>topologies</b> result from high substitution rates and biased nucleotide patterns, rather than from lateral gene transfer, as previously suggested. A reinvestigation of the relative rate increase in the endosymbiont genomes reveals variability among genes that correlate with host-associated metabolic dependencies.
