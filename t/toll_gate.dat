5|$|The Bolton to Leigh {{road was}} turnpiked in about 1770 and a <b>toll</b> <b>gate</b> was {{installed}} on the Atherton boundary on Bolton Road. Shakerley Lane toll road emerged near Green Hall on Bolton Road, and was built to get coal from the Shakerley pits to the turnpike road.|$|E
5|$|The {{highway is}} known as National Pike because it follows the {{original}} alignment of the historic National Road. As a result, there are many historic sites along Alt US40, including the Casselman Bridge in Grantsville and the last remaining National Road <b>toll</b> <b>gate</b> house in Maryland, located in LaVale.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 18th century, plans {{were made to}} replace the old <b>toll</b> <b>gate</b> at Hyde Park Corner with a grander entrance, {{following}} the gentrification of the area surrounding it. The first design was put forward by Robert Adam in 1778 as a grand archway, followed by John Soane's 1796 proposal {{to build a new}} palace adjacent to the corner in Green Park.|$|E

5|$|The National Road, {{the first}} road {{funded by the}} U.S. federal government, was {{authorized}} by the United States Congress in 1806, and ran from Cumberland, Maryland, to Vandalia, Illinois. Construction started in 1811, and by 1837 the road reached Vandalia. Many sites from the National Road remain along Alt US40, in particular the LaVale <b>toll</b> <b>gate</b> house, built in 1836. Following {{the completion of the}} National Road in 1837, the federal government ceded the road to the states to operate as a toll road, and <b>toll</b> <b>gate</b> houses such as the one in LaVale were built along its path in preparation for the transfer. Tolls continued to be collected along the National Road at the LaVale toll house until the late nineteenth century. The LaVale toll house is {{the first of its kind}} to be built along the National Road, and it is the last standing toll house along the National Road in Maryland. The LaVale toll house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Before {{developing}} the route west of Aspen, the state turned its attention the other way. In 1927 it rebuilt the old stage road over Independence Pass to Twin Lakes and designated {{it part of}} Highway 82, closing it in winters to avoid the maintenance costs. Most of it followed the original route; however in some places it deviated. The largest section of the original remains three miles (5km) below the pass on the east approach. The foundation of the gatekeeper's house remains, {{as well as some}} of the original <b>toll</b> <b>gate.</b>|$|E
5|$|On March 22, 1989, three Will Rogers Turnpike tollbooth attendants made a {{surprise}} appearance at a Tulsans Against Turnpikes {{press conference to}} offer support to the opposition movement, expressing dissatisfaction with working conditions while manning the turnpike. The three attendants also gave examples of firsthand experience with turnpike customers that had convinced them that motorists were not as supportive of turnpikes as OTA executives believed. OTA responded to their employees' remarks by highlighting an Occupational Safety and Health Administration study that found that the <b>toll</b> <b>gate</b> that the three attendants worked at met all safety standards.|$|E

5|$|East of Eckhart Mines, Alt US40 {{passes through}} Clarysville, where it intersects MD55. It is near Clarysville that the terrain {{followed}} by Alt US40 changes: from Clarysville westward {{to the summit}} of Savage Mountain, the road runs uphill, while east of Clarysville, the road follows valleys, first following the valley around Braddock Run to Cumberland, and then following the valley around Wills Creek into Cumberland. Near the MD55 intersection is a stone arch bridge which was initially built in 1812 and rebuilt in the 1830s, and carried the National Road over Braddock Run, a tributary to Wills Creek. East of Clarysville, the highway passes through a gap carved by Braddock Run between Piney Mountain and Dan's Mountain. I-68, having been built later, {{is located on the}} hillside above Alt US40, on the Dan's Mountain side of the gap. Alt US40 then descends Red Hill into LaVale. At the bottom of Red Hill is the La Vale <b>toll</b> <b>gate</b> house. Built in 1836, tolls were collected there until the early 1900s, and it is the last original National Road <b>toll</b> <b>gate</b> house standing in Maryland. In LaVale, the route intersects MD53, which serves as a truck bypass for US 220 to Cresaptown. Alt US40 interchanges with westbound I-68 at exit 39, but eastbound access is only available via MD53 and MD658, which intersects Alt US40 east of the exit 39 interchange. The highway expands to a four-lane road near its intersection with MD53, then narrows to a two-lane road near its intersection with MD658. East of the intersection with MD658, Alt US40 turns northward, passing through LaVale toward the Narrows, bypassing Haystack Mountain to the north, as opposed to I-68, which passes directly over Haystack Mountain, paralleling Braddock Road (MD49).|$|E
5|$|On December 31, 2006, the Turnpike Authority {{released}} its proposals regarding Interchange 8. The old Interchange 8 {{was to be}} demolished and replaced with a new interchange. The new Exit 8 would end at the intersection with Route 33, Milford Road, and the 133 bypass (on {{the east side of}} the expressway, instead of the west). This new Exit 8 would grant direct access to the bypass (without going through any traffic lights), as well as to 33, using grade-separated interchanges. The new <b>toll</b> <b>gate</b> was to feature a total of 10 lanes at the new facility. The new interchange opened in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} third repulse of the Confederates on the western wing, the 2nd Kentucky and 9th Tennessee regiments arrived from the Mauckport Road and joined the battle, giving the attackers a {{numerical}} superiority. At about 12:40p.m., Capt. Byrnes arrived with the Confederate artillery and used his two ten-pound Parrott rifle cannons to pin down the defenders in the works. In the meantime, Morgan was leading his main body of troops far around {{the eastern edge of}} the defenses and up the Plank Road, threatening the town directly and bypassing the defenses entirely. As they moved onto the Corydon Pike, they shot and robbed a <b>toll</b> <b>gate</b> keeper who refused to throw down his gun.|$|E

5000|$|In most motorways, toll is {{proportional}} to the distance traveled and has to be paid on exit, where <b>toll</b> <b>gates</b> ( [...] caselli) are placed. On other motorways, however, <b>toll</b> <b>gates</b> are placed directly along the route ( [...] barriere). In such cases, it is required to pay a fixed amount, regardless of the distance traveled. A8, A9, A52 are good examples of that system.|$|R

5|$|The modern routing of NY317 was {{originally}} {{the northern part}} of the Jordan and Skaneateles Plank Road. Chartered in 1855, the Jordan and Skaneateles Plank Road Company was set to provide a plank road from Jordan southward to Skaneateles. This plank road was constructed in the 1850s in place of the Syracuse and Auburn Railroad and a small railroad from Skaneateles to Skaneateles Junction, two crude railroads that were in the area which had ended service in 1836 and 1850 respectively. On March25, 1853, the New York State Assembly proposed an additional <b>toll</b> <b>gate</b> to be constructed in Elbridge along the plank road. On June15, 1853, the bill was passed by the Legislature and went into effect.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth {{had been}} a {{significant}} border settlement since the Roman occupation of Britain, when it {{was the site of}} the fort of Blestium. The River Wye may have been bridged at this time but the Monnow, being easily fordable, appears not to have had a crossing until after the Norman Conquest. According to the local tradition, construction of Monnow Bridge began in 1272 to replace a 12th-century Norman timber bridge. Through the medieval era, the English Civil War, and the Chartist uprising, the bridge played a significant, if ineffectual, role in defending Monmouth. It also served as a gaol, a munitions store, a lodge, an advertising hoarding, a focus for celebrations and, most significantly, as a <b>toll</b> <b>gate.</b> Much of the medieval development of Monmouth was funded by the taxes and tolls the borough was entitled to raise through Royal Charter. The tolls were collected through control of the points of entry to the town, including the gatehouse on Monnow Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The Hampton and Whitehall Turnpike Road Company was {{initially}} financed through 800 {{shares of stock}} valued at $20 each. Under {{the text of the}} act establishing the entity, only one <b>toll</b> <b>gate</b> was permitted on the turnpike. The toll charged at the gate varied by person; the exact amount was based on the vehicle used and the number of livestock and horses that were brought onto the roadway. By 1920, the turnpike company ceased to exist and the state of New York had plans in place to improve the portion of the turnpike west of the hamlet of East Whitehall. The improved road would be part of a state highway extending from the village of Whitehall to the Vermont state line at Fair Haven, Vermont. The contract for the project was awarded on April5, 1921, and the highway was completed by 1926.|$|E

5|$|The Commissioners {{were given}} by the state {{additional}} powers to build and maintain approaches {{to the park and}} other parks as well, this allowed the commissioners to build a series of boulevards around the city. Western Avenue from the northwestern corner of Washington Park to the location of the <b>toll</b> <b>gate</b> of the Western Turnpike was under the purview of the commissioners. Work on the road began in late 1876 and was finished the next year. The total construction cost of the park, including purchasing the real estate and improving Western Avenue, was $1,073,020.91. In 1878 Northern Boulevard (today Manning Boulevard) was constructed by the commissioners, it extended from the western end of their jurisdiction on Western Avenue north and east to the intersection of Clinton and Central avenues. In 1896 the state legislature also gave the commissioners authority over Lake Avenue from the park corner at Madison Avenue south to New Scotland Avenue (then- Albany, Schoharie, and Rensselaerville Plank Road). In addition to boulevards the Commissioners of Washington Park also gained control of other existing parks, and built new ones throughout the city, including Academy Park, Bleeker Park, Hudson Avenue Park, Clinton Square, Rensselaer Park, St. Joseph's Park, Townsend Park, Beaver Park (later Lincoln Park), and the former grounds of the Dudley Observatory. In 1900 the board of commissioners was transformed into the Bureau of Parks in the Department of Public Works and later the bureau became a separate department.|$|E
25|$|The Parkway extends {{across the}} center of the {{township}} for , heading northeast from Elmwood Park to Rochelle Park.

25|$|Each tag {{can only}} be used with the {{registered}} number plate and has a unique account. All accounts on the M6 Toll are pre-paid, and must contain a positive balance, sufficient {{to cover the cost}} of the vehicle's toll, in order for the vehicle to be allowed through the <b>toll</b> <b>gate.</b> If the balance is sufficient, the tag will beep once and the barrier at the <b>toll</b> <b>gate</b> will automatically raise. If the balance is low (fewer than three journeys remaining), the tag will beep twice. If the balance of the account cannot cover the cost of the toll, the barrier will remain closed and an alternative method of payment must be used.|$|E
