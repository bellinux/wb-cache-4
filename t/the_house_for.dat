5|$|Dr. John Markway narrates {{the history}} of the 90-year-old Hill House, which was {{constructed}} by Hugh Crain as a home for his wife. She died when her carriage crashed against a tree as she approached <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> the first time. Crain remarried, but his second wife died in the house from a fall down the stairs. Crain's daughter Abigail lived in <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> the rest of her life, never moving out of the nursery. She died calling for her nurse-companion. The companion inherited the house, but later hanged herself from a spiral staircase in the library.

5|$|A second death, {{less than}} a week later, forced {{authorities}} to reconsider the cause of Nickell's death. On June 11, Susan Snow, a 40-year-old Auburn bank manager, took two Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules for an early-morning headache.

At 6:30 am, the Snows' fifteen-year-old daughter found Susan Snow collapsed on the floor of her bathroom, unresponsive and with a faint pulse. Paramedics were called and transported Snow to Harborview Medical Center, but she died later that day without regaining consciousness.|$|E
5|$|As House Speaker, Gingrich oversaw passage by the House {{of welfare}} reform and {{a capital gains tax}} cut in 1997.

5|$|He was bailed {{from the}} police station on 13 September, after which he went on holiday to Saint-Tropez.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify <b>the</b> {{characteristics}} of <b>house</b> designs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly and disabled. We devised a method for characterizing the plans of new houses and compared examples of new <b>houses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> disabled and ordinary non-adapted <b>houses</b> in <b>the</b> Hokkaido region of Japan. We examined 65 <b>houses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> disabled and 70 ordinary non-adapted <b>houses.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that the proportion of corridor type designs, in which there are two lines of flow in the bedroom, was significantly more in <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> disabled. In addition, more classifications were needed to categorize <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> disabled, some of which contained a toilet and/or bathroom for exclusive use by the disabled member of the household. 本研究の目的は，高齢者・障害者同居住宅の平面構成の特性を明らかにすることである。そのために，住宅平面の類型化を用いた手法を新たに考案し，北海道内の新築事例から障害者住宅と一般住宅とを比較検討した。得られたサンプル数は障害者住宅が 65 ，一般住宅が 70 だった。その結果，障害者住宅は，一般住宅に比べて本人の寝室に 2 つの動線をもつ「回廊型」が有意に多いことが示された。また，障害者住宅は類型化した全てのタイプに分散され，さらにトイレ・浴室が本人専用であることから疑似型が生じた。従って，障害者住宅の平面特性として「回廊型」が多く，多様性であることが示唆される...|$|R

5|$|A businessman, Blackmer, {{visits the}} reclusive Dr Orchard, a {{scientist}} {{who lives in a}} remote house on the Ambro River in South America. From the local plant Sidonicus americanus, Orchard has developed a food additive called Theramine; if administered to animals, the chemical causes them to grow beyond their original size. Enlargement of animal stock would offer a simple solution to world famine and present other economic advantages. Blackmer's boatman, Culp, eavesdrops on the meeting. After a storm forces Blackmer to stay at <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> the night, Culp resolves to steal the Theramine and sell it to the highest bidder. Waiting until the other occupants fall asleep, he steals the keys to Orchard's laboratory from the housekeeper, Mrs Files. While filling a vial with a quantity of the chemical, Culp accidentally knocks the rest of the supply into a sink, and the Theramine drains into the Ambro River.|$|E
