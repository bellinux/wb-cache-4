40|$|The Williams-Beuren {{syndrome}} (WBS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder {{characterized by}} mental retardation with unique cognitive and personality profile, distinctive facial features, supravalvular aortic stenosis, short stature, connective tissue anomalies, hypertension, infantile hypercalcemia, dental and kidney abnormalities and premature {{aging of the}} skin. Its incidence is estimated at 1 / 15, 000 and sporadic de novo inheritance is usual. Molecular basis of the syndrome is a heterozygous ~ 1. 5 Mb microdeletion or inversion at chromosome band 7 q 11. 23. While {{our understanding of the}} etiology of WBS has improved greatly, we are still ignorant as to the molecular basis of all except the cardiovascular phenotype. To define where the 31 WBS critical region genes exert their function and identify their possible role in the WBS phenotypes we performed a systematic analysis of the expression profile of all their murine orthologues. To obtain an high resolution expression pattern several complementary methods were combined: RT-PCR on a mouse cDNA panel of 12 adult tissues and 4 developmental stages; wholemount in situ of E 9. 5 and E 10. 5 embryos, section in situ of E 14. 5 embryos, brain section in situ of E 15. 5 embryos, P 7 and P 56 mouse. These stages correspond to mid and late embryonic and fetal human periods, when the major organs and body regions are organized, while the brain sections allow to correlate expression with neuroanatomical changes described in WBS patients. The <b>topographical</b> <b>catalogue</b> of expression of the murine orthologues of WBS genes will be instrumental {{to the understanding of the}} pathogenesis of this contiguous gene syndrome. The entire data set will be comprehensively documented on a freely accessible web page, which will lists the WBS genes, their murine orthologs and the probes used for ISH and displays images as well as annotation tables...|$|E
40|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS), {{caused by}} the presence of an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (HC 21), is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation with an incidence of approximately 1 / 700 live births. The sequence of the human chromosome 21 provided evidence for the presence of approximately 220 genes. An important challenge is now to understand how three normal copies of these genes are associated with the various DS phenotypes (mental retardation, congenital heart disease, early onset Alzheimers disease and an increased risk of leukemia). To define where HC 21 genes exert their function and identify their possible role in the DS phenotype we have decided to perform a systematic analysis of the expression profile of their murine homologues. We collected 150 murine cDNA clones from several sources. To obtain a high resolution expression pattern several complementary methods were combined: (i) RT-PCR on a mouse cDNA panel of 12 adult tissues and 4 developmental stages; (ii) wholemount in situ hybridisation of E 9. 5 and E 10. 5 embryos and (iii) section in situhybridisation of E 14. 5 embryos and of P 7 brains. This set of whole embryos and sections corresponds to mid and late embryonic and foetal human periods, when most of the major organs and body regions are organised. Genes showing an interesting and/or restricted expression pattern were analysed further on appropriate sections at more developmental timepoints. 87 % of the tested genes showed a clear expression pattern during murine development. In 37 % of the cases expression was ubiquitous while 50 % of the cDNAs showed a differential expression pattern in the embryonal tissues. The <b>topographical</b> <b>catalogue</b> of expression of the murine homologues of human chromosome 21 genes will be instrumental {{to the understanding of the}} pathogenesis of trisomy 21. Currently, approximately 100 genes have already been tested some of which display a pattern of expression relevant to the congenital heart disease and to the mental retardation observed in DS. The entire data set will be made available to the scientific community via a web site...|$|E
