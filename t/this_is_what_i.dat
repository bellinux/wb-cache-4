25|$|That you say as {{a theologian}} that I am a universalist is evident, {{in the sense}} that I believe that Jesus was sent into the world to save the sinners that we all are. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{understand}} Saint Paul to say when he mentions that sin has entered the world through one man, Adam, and spread to all men, and that he calls Jesus the second Adam through Whom redemption entered the world for all men, and even as he says 'all of creation,' that the redemption of Christ is the victory of God over the Fall. I believe that this great plan of salvation is universal, concerns not only all men but the universality of the world and that Jesus on the Cross has accomplished this Salvation, this reconciliation of men with God, that the 'chastisement' as Isaiah says is fallen upon Him to free men from the malediction of the Fall. This plan of God therefore seems to be collective, global, universal.|$|E

At {{the end of}} that year he was visited by Herman Gotthardt, a {{wholesaler}} from Malmö, who had recently taken up art collecting as a hobby. He studied Jolin's numerous works and, as at this time the artists sold very few paintings, it came as a surprise to him when Gotthardt bought 16 canvases. Jolin received seven thousand crowns (sek) for the paintings, and at home the same evening he was able to show his parents the money from his first major sales, saying: [...] "Look here, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> earned today".|$|E

The two became friends and quickly discovered their shared interest in punk. MacKaye and Nelson saw their first punk show in January 1979—a benefit concert by the Cramps for WGTB. The concert inspired the pair; MacKaye later admitted, [...] "It blew my mind because I saw {{for the first time}} this huge, totally invisible community that had gathered together for this tribal event.

Not just sexual, I just mean whatever—open your mouth. That's empowering to me. That's what the song is about." [...] In an interview with Perez Hilton, Hilson said that she cannot allow other people or the media to dictate what she can and what cannot do. She also dismissed the negative reviews, because she knew some women were [...] "empowered" [...] by its message. She added that listeners have to be fearless and stand for what they believe in and concluded by saying that [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] is not meant for children.|$|E

[...] The main idea behind the episode, was that God knows all the numbers, because they are his numbers and he is laying them down and is in [...] "charge of the big game".

While he was engaged in these and other pious works, a full year after his return, having provided much instruction and a great example, with much preparation, he piously passed on, leaving for his children by a special inheritance the propagation of the faith in his estate, {{and the protection of}} the religious (i.e. [...] "members of religious orders") in that kingdom. The King and all the nobles were greatly saddened by his passing, but especially the Christians and Religious, who knew very well the virtue and religious zeal of this man. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> heard by letters from the very Religious who administered the sacraments to him, and who had been present at his death, as well as from others."

500|$|The film cuts to {{the closing}} credits from {{a shot of the}} top {{apparently}} starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, [...] "I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny to me is that people really do expect me to answer it." [...] The film's script concludes with [...] "Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT".

The real point of the scene — and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> tell people — is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind.

500|$|Endorsed by meat {{production}} company Oscar Mayer, [...] "Sisters at Heart" [...] is a half-hour, color episode that aired on December 24, 1970, as the 213th episode of Bewitched to be aired. As an introduction and conclusion to the episode, Montgomery briefly {{spoke to the}} camera about the episode, saying that it [...] "was created in the true spirit of Christmas ... conceived {{in the image of}} innocence and filled with truth." [...] ABC aired the episode only once more, in December 1971. Unlike many of the other episodes in the season, it was neither a remake of an episode from a previous season nor part of the Salem, Massachusetts, story arc that was filmed in the area where the 17th-century Salem witch trials took place. Don Marshall, who made a guest appearance in [...] "Sisters at Heart" [...] as Keith Wilson, was known for his role in Land of the Giants, while Janee Michelle, who portrayed Dorothy Wilson in [...] "Sisters at Heart", later became best known for her role in the 1974 horror film The House on Skull Mountain. [...] "Sisters at Heart" [...] was Montgomery's favorite episode of the series. Reflecting on the episode in 1989, she said, [...] "Yeah, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want Bewitched to be all about." [...] Sony Pictures Home Entertainment eventually released the episode on a VHS collection called A Bewitched Christmas 2.
