500|$|In {{his opening}} speech on 26 September 2001, Garnham said that race {{may have played}} a part in the case, {{due to the fact that}} a black child was murdered by her black carers, and the social worker and police officer most closely {{involved}} in the case were black. He said that the fear of being accused of racism may have led to the inaction. In the hearings, Arthurworrey, who is African-Caribbean, admitted that her assumptions about African–Caribbean families influenced her judgement, and that she had assumed Climbié's timidness in the presence of Kouao and Manning stemmed not from fear, but from the African–Caribbean culture of respect towards one's parents. Ratna Dutt, director of the Race Equality Unit (now the Race Equality Foundation), a charity that provides race-awareness training to social workers, later said, [...] "the implicit message is that it's acceptable for ethnic minorities to receive poor services under the guise of superficial cultural sensitivity. This is absolutely shameful, as it allows people to argue that good practice is compromised by anti-racism"; and, contrasting the outcomes of the white and black staff members involved, [...] "for a large number of black frontline staff if the finger of blame is pointed at them they don't end up in jobs in other local authorities. That's how institutional racism operates". Jacqui Smith, Home Secretary from 2007, said: [...] "I have not seen widespread evidence <b>that</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> are not taking action", and, [...] "there are no cultures that condone child abuse. We are absolutely clear <b>that</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and social work departments have a responsibility to consider whether children are subjected to harm, and if they think they are, to take action".sic] correctness 'puts children at risk'"].

500|$|The inquiry {{heard that}} many of the councils were understaffed, underfunded, and poorly managed. The chief {{executive}} of Brent council said its social services department was [...] "seriously defective". The inquiry was told that many cases at Brent social services were closed inappropriately before inspection by the social services inspectorate, that children were being placed unaccompanied in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, and that children in need were turned away. The inquiry heard how Edward Armstrong had previously been ordered not to work with children over his handling of a case in 1993. Haringey and Brent councils diverted £18.7 million and over £26 million, respectively, in the two years 1997/98 and 1998/99, from its social services department into services such as education, for other purposes; both underspent their budgets for children's services, totalling £28m, by more than £10m in 1998–99, causing a deteriorating of child protection services. The inquiry heard how Haringey council failed to assign social workers to 109 children in May 1999, a short period before they took on Climbié's case. Again in January 2002, Haringey council failed to assign social workers to about 50 children. Haringey council wrote a letter to Laming claiming <b>that</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> who gave evidence were being questioned more harshly than other witnesses. Laming condemned the letter, saying [...] "I will not tolerate any covert attempt to influence {{the way in which the}} inquiry is conducted." [...] Mary Richardson, the director of social services at Haringey from 1 April 1998 until 31 March 2000, had been responsible for a restructuring of the department which, according to the union UNISON, had [...] "virtually paralysed" [...] the child protection service. She received contact from twelve senior practitioners and team managers criticising the proposals as [...] "potentially dangerous and detrimental to the people to whom we offer a service". Richardson provided no substantive response to the memorandum. She did, however, say in the inquiry that the blame lay on [...] "part of all of the line management responsibility". Gurbux Singh, the former chief executive of Haringey council (before becoming the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality), said that there was nothing he could have done to prevent Climbié's death. Garnham contrasted this with Rossiter's willingness to accept responsibility, saying, [...] "that willingness to acknowledge error is at least at the root, is it not, of progress?" ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} how <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> who works in social services in Sweden talk about and construct threats and violence from clients as a problem within their workgroup. The data in this study was collected through two focus group discussions with eleven <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> divided in two different work groups.

The findings in this study shows <b>that</b> the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>that</b> participated had difficulties in defining threats and violence from clients because it was considered to be individual for every <b>social</b> <b>worker.</b> Furthermore, the study also shows <b>that</b> the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> felt <b>that</b> threats and violence from clients came with the job and therefore had to accept it.

[...] The social worker argued {{that she was not}} bound by the Fourth Amendment restrictions against unreasonable search and seizure. [...] Furthermore, both the social worker and police officer claimed immunity from suits {{regardless of whether or not}} they violated a family's constitutional rights. [...] The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on August 26, 1999 that [...] "a social worker and a police officer are not entitled to qualified immunity for investigating a report of a child crying by making a nonconsensual entry into a home without a search warrant or special exigency and coercing a parent to aid them in strip-searching her child." [...] This ruling clarified <b>that</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> are government officials and are bound by the Fourth Amendment and may be sued for violations of that amendment and has been cited repeatedly in subsequent court rulings regarding searches in child abuse investigations.|$|E

Thirty-seven participants agreed to complete an on-line questionnaire on the topic. The study findings indicated <b>that</b> CWS <b>social</b> <b>workers???</b> most preferred coping resources were talking to co-workers, talking to family, and exercising. A small percentage of CWS <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> utilized smoking and alcohol as a coping resource. CWS <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> stated <b>that</b> having a supportive supervisor or agency support was beneficial in the prevention of burnout. This study also found that one???s personal history of trauma may contribute to burnout and <b>that</b> those <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> with positive outlooks in life were less likely to burn out. <b>Social</b> <b>workers</b> were asked about burnout prevention. <b>Social</b> <b>workers</b> provided a multitude of responses, including a smaller caseload, supportive supervisors, and agency support.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} how street-level bureaucrats, working with clients with mental illness, are implementing their statutory obligation of support for family carers who are caring for or supporting relatives with mental illness. The study are based on vignettes and qualitative interviews with <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> in three different municipalities in southern Sweden.   The questions of this study are: • How do the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> communicate their statutory obligation of support to family carers? • How do the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> distinguish the family carers? • How do the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> distinguish the family carers who are in need of support?   Metod: Vignettes and qualitative interviews has been used as methods to gather empirical data. Theory: Theories of street-level bureaucracy has been used as theory in the analyses of the empirical material. Results: The result of this study concludes <b>that</b> the <b>social</b> <b>workers,</b> in lack of policy introduction, communicate their obligation to support family carers within their discretion. The result shows that the majority of the municipalities do not have formalized support for family carers supporting relatives with mental illness. The study also concludes <b>that</b> the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> have different understandings of which family carer who is a carer in need of support.
