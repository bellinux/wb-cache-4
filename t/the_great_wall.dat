5|$|Europeans first {{witnessed}} <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> in {{the early}} 1600s. Perhaps the first recorded instance of a European actually entering China via <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> came in 1605, when the Portuguese Jesuit brother Bento de Góis reached the northwestern Jiayu Pass from India. Ivan Petlin's 1619 deposition for his Russian embassy mission offers an early account based on a first-hand encounter with <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall,</b> and mentions that {{in the course of}} the journey his embassy travelled alongside <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> for ten days.|$|E
5|$|The travelogues of {{the later}} 19th century in turn further contributed to the {{elaboration}} and propagation of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> myth. Examples of this myth's growth are the false but widespread belief that <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> of China is visible from the Moon or Mars.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the scholar-turned-bureaucrat Guo Moruo {{laid out}} the first modern {{proposal}} to repair <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall.</b> Five years later, the renovated Badaling became the first section to be {{opened to the public}} since the establishment of the PRC. The Badaling Great Wall has since become a staple stop for foreign dignitaries who come to China, beginning with Nepali prime minister Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala in 1960, and most notably the American president Richard Nixon in his historic 1972 visit to China. To date, Badaling is still the most visited stretch of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{usefulness}} of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> as a defence line against northern nomads became questionable under the Qing dynasty, since their territory encompassed vast areas {{inside and outside}} the wall: China proper, Manchuria, and Mongolia were all under Qing control. So instead, <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> became the means to limit Han Chinese movement into the steppes. In the case of Manchuria, considered to be the sacred homeland by the ruling Manchu elites, some parts of the Ming Liaodong Wall were repaired so it could serve to control Han Chinese movement into Manchuria alongside the newly erected Willow Palisade.|$|E
5|$|Wall {{construction}} {{continued until}} {{the demise of}} the Ming dynasty in 1644. In the decades that led to the fall of the Ming dynasty, the Ming court and <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> itself had to deal with simultaneous internal rebellions and the Manchu invasions. In addition to their conquest of Liaodong, the Manchus had raided across <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> {{for the first time in}} 1629, and again in 1634, 1638, and 1642. Meanwhile, the rebels led by warlord Li Zicheng had been gathering strength. In the early months of 1644, Li Zicheng declared himself the founder of the Shun and marched towards the Ming capital from Shaanxi. His route roughly followed the line of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall,</b> in order to neutralize its heavily fortified garrisons. The crucial defences of Datong, Xuanfu, and Juyong Pass all surrendered without a fight, and the Chongzhen Emperor hanged himself on 25 April as the Shun army entered Beijing. At this point, the largest remaining Ming fighting force in North China was in Shanhai Pass, where <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> meets the Bohai Sea. Its defender Wu Sangui, wedged between the Shun army within and the Manchus without, decided to surrender to the Manchus and opened the gates for them. The Manchus, having thus entered through <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall,</b> defeated Li Zicheng at the Battle of Shanhai Pass and seized Beijing on June5. They eventually defeated both the rebel-founded Shun dynasty and the remaining Ming resistance, establishing their rule over all of China as the Qing dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a useful}} {{deterrent}} against raids, at several points throughout its history <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> failed to stop enemies, including in 1644 when the Manchu Qing marched {{through the gates}} of Shanhai Pass and replaced the most ardent of the wall-building dynasties, the Ming, as rulers of China.|$|E

5|$|Culturally, the wall's {{symbolic}} {{role as a}} {{line between}} civilized society and barbarism was suppressed by the Qing, who were keen to weaken the Han culturalism that had been propagated by the Ming.

Under their ambitious and energetic management, 1200 brick watchtowers were built along <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> from 1569 to 1571. These included the first large-scale use of hollow watchtowers on the Wall: up until this point, most previous towers along <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> had been solid, with a small hut on top for a sentry to take shelter from the elements and Mongol arrows; the Ji–Chang towers built from 1569 onwards were hollow brick structures, allowing soldiers interior space to live, store food and water, stockpile weapons, and take shelter from Mongol arrows.|$|E

5|$|Since then, many {{scholars}} have operated under {{the belief that}} <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> continually defended China's border against the steppe nomads for two thousand years. For example, the 18th-century sinologist Joseph de Guignes assigned macrohistorical importance to such walls when he advanced {{the theory that the}} Qin construction forced the Xiongnu to migrate west to Europe and, becoming known as the Huns, ultimately contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire. Some have attempted to make general statements regarding Chinese society and foreign policy based on the conception of a perennial Great Wall: Karl Marx took the Wall to represent the stagnation of the Chinese society and economy, Owen Lattimore supposed that <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> demonstrated a need to divide the nomadic way of life from the agricultural communities of China, and John K. Fairbank posited that the Wall played a part in upholding the Sinocentric world order.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{war with}} the Western Xia, the Song also settled land {{disputes}} with them by referring to prior agreements, as with the Liao. However, soon after the Jin dynasty overthrew the Liao dynasty, the Jurchens sacked the Song capital in 1127 during the Jin–Song wars, causing the Song court to flee south of the Yangtze River. For the next {{two and a half}} centuries, <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> played no role in Han Chinese geopolitics.|$|E
5|$|Han Chinese power {{during the}} tumultuous post-Tang era was {{represented}} by the Song dynasty (9601279), which completed its unification of the Chinese states with the conquest of Wuyue in 971. Turning to the north after this victory, in 979 the Song eliminated the Northern Han, ultimate successors to the Later Jin, but were unable to take the Sixteen Prefectures from the Liao dynasty. As a result of Song's military aggression, relations between the Song and Liao remained tense and hostile. One of the battlegrounds in the Song–Liao War was <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> Gap (長城口), so named because the southern Yan wall of the Warring States period crossed the Juma River here into Liao territory. <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> Gap saw action in 979, 988989, and 1004, and a Song fortress was built there in 980. Intermittent wars between the Song and the Liao lasted until January 1005, when a truce was called {{and led to the}} Treaty of Chanyuan. This agreement, among other things, required the Song to pay tribute to the Liao, recognized the Song and Liao as equals, and demarcated the Song–Liao border, the course of which became more clearly defined in a series of subsequent bilateral agreements. Several stretches of the old Great Walls, including the Northern Qi Inner Wall near the Hengshan mountain range, became the border between the Song and the Liao.|$|E
