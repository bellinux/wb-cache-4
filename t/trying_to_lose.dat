25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} things to take into consideration when either <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> or put on weight is output versus input. It is important to know the amount of energy your body is using every day, so that your intake fits the needs of one's personal weight goal. Someone wanting to lose weight would want a smaller energy intake than what they put out. There is increasing research-based evidence that low-fat vegetarian diets consistently lead to healthy weight loss and management, a decrease in diabetic symptoms as well as improved cardiac health.|$|E
25|$|At 11:30, Tyrwhitt's {{squadron}} {{came upon}} another German cruiser, Mainz and the ships engaged for 20 minutes, {{before the arrival}} of Goodenough caused Mainz to attempt an escape. Goodenough gave chase and in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> him, Mainz came back across the path of Arethusa and her destroyers. Her steering was damaged, causing her to turn back into the path of Goodenough's ships and she was hit by shells and torpedo. At 12:20, her captain ordered his ship to be scuttled and the crew to abandon ship. Keyes had now joined the main body of ships and brought Lurcher alongside Mainz to take off the crew. Three British destroyers had been seriously damaged in the engagement.|$|E

500|$|When Richard Wallhead, the Labour MP for Merthyr, died on 27 April 1934, Davies was {{selected}} as the party's candidate for the June by-election, {{with the support of the}} MFGB. Wallhead had held the seat since 1922, with large majorities; in the 1931 general election he had defeated a single opponent, a candidate from Oswald Mosley's New Party who had received tacit support from the Conservative Party. Davies faced opposition from the Liberal Party, the Communist Party and the ILP. With no candidate from the ruling National Government in the field, Davies was denied an obvious target for attack; as the Manchester Guardian stated in its pre-poll analysis, he was put on the defensive: [...] "His is the dispiriting task of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> as few votes as possible". The paper predicted a close result.|$|E
500|$|Betty's two passions in {{life are}} darts and food. Playing darts brings out her {{competitive}} side, and she enjoys beating her male customers. Cyril frequently protests when Betty attempts to diet, as he prefers her [...] "homely and comfortable" [...] figure. Ultimately, Betty stops <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight, stating: [...] "I had to [...] between losing a few pounds or losing my marital partner. If my Cyril had wanted to marry a skinny rabbit he'd have married one." [...] Betty breaks down when Cyril dies from a heart attack, with Little noting that: [...] "Cyril had been the stabilizing force in Betty's life, and without him she relied heavily on her job and friends at the Rovers – she couldn't face life alone at home". Little has observed that Betty [...] "has a finely tuned {{sense of right and}} wrong and has never been afraid to stand up for her beliefs", citing Betty's shock at being mugged in 1982, and calling the NSPCC to report a female neighbour whose children were left outside until nightfall while their mother entertained her boyfriend.|$|E

500|$|... "Kingdom Come" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, calling it [...] "a particularly superficial addition to the series". Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode's lack of complexity was refreshing, but ultimately the [...] "awkward" [...] performances and [...] "cheesy" [...] approach to its subject matter detracted from it. Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B, describing it as [...] "an episode {{about a man who}} finds himself <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> his faith but being unable to do so". VanDerWerff felt that the episode suffered from [...] "the typical Millennium problems", including [...] "an overreliance on trite philosophical dialogue"; however, he found that it contained [...] "something pure and believable at its core that keeps the episode moving along nicely". The episode's thematic concern with {{the role of religion in}} society was noted as being [...] "the tension Millennium would build its best episodes on". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated [...] "Kingdom Come" [...] 5 out of 5, describing it as being [...] "classic Millennium". Gibron felt that the episode had [...] "an exceptional script that delightfully fails to spell everything out for us up front", and noted that it served as [...] "the blueprint for all better Millennium episodes to come".|$|E

2500|$|Gallinger had gambled on the Bruins {{from the}} time of his rookie year, {{although}} he later insisted he never bet on Boston to lose until he met Billy Taylor. Taylor, a 28-year-old center, had arrived to the Bruins in a trade to start the 1947–48 season and was living in the same boarding house as Gallinger. Taylor, who had a reputation for gambling, had heard Gallinger also gambled, and explained to Gallinger how he could double his yearly $7,500 salary by betting on his team to lose. Taylor and Gallinger rationalized that they were not deliberately <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> games, since they were only betting on games their team would probably lose anyway.|$|E

June, Maybelle, and Ezra Carter moved into Cash's mansion for a month to help him get off drugs. Cash proposed onstage to June on February 22, 1968, at a concert at the London Gardens in London, Ontario, Canada. The couple married a week later (on March 1) in Franklin, Kentucky.

60|$|They {{were singing}} Vespers when I entered, and I heard the shrill voices of choristers crying the responses; {{it did not}} sound like Christian music. The mosque was dimly lit, the air heavy with incense; and I saw this forest of pillars, {{extending}} every way, {{as far as the}} eye could reach. It was mysterious and awe-inspiring as those enchanted forests of one's childhood in which huge trees grew in serried masses and where in cavernous darkness goblins and giants of the fairy-tales, wild beasts and monstrous shapes, lay in wait for the terrified traveller who had lost his way. I wandered, keeping the Christian chapels out of sight, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> myself among the columns; and now and then gained views of horseshoe arches interlacing, decorated with Moorish tracery.|$|E
60|$|Caleb was not {{so eager}} after rabbits as Shepherd Gathergood, but he disliked the fox for another reason. He {{considered}} that the hunted fox was a great danger to sheep when the ewes were heavy with lambs and when the chase brought the animal near if not right into the flock. He had one dreadful memory of a hunted fox <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> itself in his flock of heavy-sided ewes and the hounds following it and driving the poor sheep mad with terror. The result was {{that a large number}} of lambs were cast before their time and many others were poor, sickly things; many of the sheep also suffered in health. He had no extra money from the lambs that year. He received but a shilling (half a crown is often paid now) for every lamb above the number of ewes, and as a rule received from three to six pounds a year from this source.|$|E
60|$|A {{few years}} ago, {{if any one}} in Fleet street had said that the day would come when I would devote my time to <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> my reputation, I would have smiled incredulously. That was before I had a reputation. To be as {{statistical}} as time will allow--for before I go to bed I have {{seven and a half}} yards of fiction to write--it took me fifteen years' hard work to acquire a reputation. For two years after that I worked as diligently to retain it, not being quite certain whether it was really there, and {{for the last five years}} I have done my best to get rid of it. Mr. R. L. Stevenson has a story of a dynamiter who tried in vain to leave an infernal machine anywhere. It was always returned to him as soon as he dropped it, or just as he was making off. My reputation is as difficult to lose. I have not given up the attempt yet, but I am already of opinion that it is even harder to lose a reputation in letters than to make one. My colleagues will bear me out in this.|$|E
