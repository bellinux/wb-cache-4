5|$|A {{dust devil}} (also {{known as a}} whirlwind) resembles a tornado in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{vertical}} swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion {{that can be seen}} near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.|$|E

5|$|A {{report in}} 1997 {{described}} use of sponges {{as a tool}} by bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay in Western Australia. A dolphin will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum, which is presumably then used to protect it when searching for food in the sandy sea bottom. The behavior, known as sponging, has only been observed in this bay, and is almost exclusively shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behavior to their daughters, and that all the sponge-users are closely related, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fairly recent innovation.|$|E

5|$|Archaeopteryx is a genus of {{theropod}} dinosaur {{closely related}} to the birds. Since the late 19th century, it has been accepted by palaeontologists, and celebrated in lay reference works, as being the oldest known bird, though a study in 2011 has cast doubt on this assessment, suggesting instead <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> non-avialan dinosaur {{closely related to}} the origin of birds.|$|E

Inevitably, Michael notices and tries to get Jim to admit that he's having a party, while Jim acts nonchalantly as if nothing is happening. In order to keep Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) from exposing the party, Jim tells him <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> surprise party for Michael.|$|E

5|$|Edinburgh Zoo's long {{association}} with penguins began in January 1914, {{with the arrival}} of three king penguins from the Christian Salvesen whaling expedition which docked in Leith. The subsequent successful hatching of a king penguin chick in 1919 was the first penguin to be hatched in captivity. These were the first penguins to be seen outside of the South Atlantic anywhere in the world. The now famous daily penguin parade started by accident in 1950 with the escape of several birds. This proved so popular with visitors and the penguins <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> daily feature of the zoo today.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{developed}} the James Bond character more in Goldfinger {{than in the}} previous six novels, presenting him as a more complex individual, whilst also bringing out a theme of Bond as Saint George.

5|$|It also {{provides}} a powerful toolkit for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories. Much of {{the usefulness of the}} duality results from the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable. This fact has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.|$|E

5|$|Love's Last Shift {{is today}} read mainly {{to gain a}} {{perspective}} on Vanbrugh's sequel The Relapse, which has by contrast remained a stage favourite. Modern scholars often endorse the criticism that was levelled at Love's Last Shift from the first, namely <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> blatantly commercial combination of sex scenes and drawn-out sentimental reconciliations. Cibber's follow-up comedy Woman's Wit (1697) was produced under hasty and unpropitious circumstances and had no discernible theme; Cibber, not usually shy about any of his plays, even elided its name in the Apology. It {{was followed by the}} equally unsuccessful tragedy Xerxes (1699). Cibber reused parts of Woman's Wit for The School Boy (1702).|$|E
