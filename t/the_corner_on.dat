5|$|When Virgil Earp {{learned that}} Wyatt {{was talking to}} the Cowboys at Spangenberg's gun shop, he went there himself. Virgil testified {{afterward}} that he thought he saw all four men, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury, buying cartridges. Virgil went around <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>on</b> Allen Street to the Wells Fargo office, where he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil hid the shotgun under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford's Saloon.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{that would take}} the life of Samuel Collyer came in July 1884. While responding to the fire alarm, hose carriage number one struck an upright stone post on <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>on</b> Mineral Spring and Lonsdale Avenue and tipped over. All six firefighters were injured in the accident, those less seriously were on the step and seat of the carriage, but Collyer who rode on the reel was crushed underneath. Collyer sustained a punctured lung and broken ribs, but managed to survive for almost three weeks before succumbing to his injuries. Contemporary accounts state that the funeral service and procession were the most elaborate of any in the town's history. Collyer's home, known as the Potter-Collyer House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Five Bristol Fighters in bombing formation, {{took off}} at 11:40 with eight bombs each, which were dropped on {{retreating}} columns between Et Tire and Tulkarm. They also fired hundreds of machine gun bullets, scattering the retreating force towards Kakon and Tulkarm. At this time, machine gun {{fire from the}} ground aimed at the aircraft was fairly heavy, causing a number of casualties to the air crews. At 12:30, a second formation of three aircraft repeated {{the attack on the}} same retreating Ottoman column, which had reached <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>on</b> the Tulkarm road. Six aircraft took off in the afternoon, two pursuing the retreating columns north of Kakon heading towards Baka, while four aircraft found soldiers, transport, artillery, horses, and camels moving from Tulkarm to Anebta. These they bombed and machine gunned, in a section of the road where it passed the little Wadi Zeimer, through a gorge with steep hills on either side. Before the column could escape, another formation of seven Bristol Fighters attacked them, at about 17:00 west of Anebta. The evening patrols reported the Ottoman Seventh Army headquarters still at Nablus, but the entire Eighth Army appeared to be in retreat, with their Tulkarm headquarters already captured. At the crossroads of the Afulah and the coast roads at Sumrah, a supply base with hospital and grain dump was in flames and its inhabitants were seen retreating into the hills.|$|E

They then walked a block north to an empty lot next to C. S. Fly's boarding house where Doc Holliday lived.|$|E
25|$|In 1322, {{the deaths}} of Dagi and Temüder enabled him to seize full power. He was able to {{dismantle}} the Khunggirad faction from the Shidibala-led new administration. The severe suppression of the powerful faction including the deprivation of Temüder's titles and estates, the execution of his son drove it into <b>the</b> <b>corner.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, he appointed Baiju as the grand councillor of the right. As the sole grand councillor {{throughout the rest of}} Shidebala's reign, Baiju became a powerful ally of Shidebala. They eliminated many offices subordinate to the personal establishments of the empress dowager and the empress. The increasing influence of Neo-Confucianism saw greater limits placed on Mongol women who were allowed to move about more freely in public.|$|E
25|$|Sponge {{filters and}} corner filters (sometimes called box filters) work by {{essentially}} the same mechanism as an internal filter. Both generally work by airlift, using bubbles from an air pump rising in a tube to create flow. In a sponge filter, the inlet may only be covered by a simple open-cell block of foam. A corner filter is slightly more complex. These filters are often placed in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>on</b> {{the bottom of the}} aquarium. Water enters slits in the box, passes through a layer of medium, then exits through the airlift tube to return to the aquarium. These filters tend to only be suitable for small and lightly stocked aquaria. The sponge filter is especially useful for rearing fry where the sponge prevents the small fish from entering the filter.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 6 July, three more people were murdered in Dnipropetrovsk. The first was Egor Nechvoloda, a {{recently}} discharged army recruit, who was bludgeoned while walking home from a nightclub. His mother found {{the body in the}} morning by their apartment building on Bohdan Khmelnytsky Street. Yelena Shram, a 28‑year-old night guard, was then murdered around <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>on</b> Kosiora Street. According to Sayenko's taped confession, as Shram walked towards them, Suprunyuk struck her with the hammer he had been hiding under his shirt and struck her several more times after she fell down. She had been carrying a bag filled with clothes. The men picked up the bag, used the clothes to clean the hammer, and threw the bag out. Later the same night, the men murdered a woman named Valentina Hanzha (no apparent relation to co-defendant Alexander Hanzha), a mother of three with a disabled husband.|$|E
25|$|Martínez out {{worked and}} out landed Chávez {{throughout}} the first 11 {{rounds of the}} fight, in dominating fashion. Though Chávez had his moments trapping Martínez in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>on</b> the ropes, Martínez fought Chávez and used his fast lateral movement to avoid and neutralize Chávez' offensive attack. Chávez hurt Martinez in the 12th round, sending him to the canvas halfway through the round. Martínez got up with a little over one minute left in the fight, and rather than clinch or hold on to Chávez, Martínez continued to throw and trade blows with the Mexican. Despite being fatigued and clearly hurt, Sergio Martínez managed to survive the thrilling 12th round without holding. Martínez won the fight by unanimous decision, by the scores of 117–110, 118–109, and 118–109. After the fight, {{it was revealed that}} Martínez had broken his left hand (as early as the 4th round) and torn his right meniscus, the latter of which would require surgery.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 23 September, {{the representatives of the}} CPPCC {{discussed}} the national flags, but came to no conclusion. Some disliked the symbolism which Zeng attached to the four smaller stars, and said it should not include the bourgeoisie. The design Mao and others liked had a giant golden star in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>on</b> a red flag that was charged with a golden horizontal bar. But this design was strongly opposed by Zhang Zhizhong, who saw the golden bar as symbolizing the tearing apart of the revolution from the country. In the night, Peng Guanghan (...) recommended Zeng's design to Zhou Enlai, Zhou was satisfied with it and asked for a larger copy of the design to be made. Tan Kah Kee also gave his advice to Mao and Zhou that the power characteristics are more important than Chinese geography characteristics, so {{there was no need to}} insist on the golden bar which stands for the Yellow River. Two days later, Mao had a meeting in his office about the flag. He persuaded everyone to adopt Zeng's design, with some slight modifications. According to earlier discussions at the Beijing Hotel, the hammer and sickle from Zeng's original design was removed since it was similar to the Flag of the Soviet Union. On 27 September 1949, Zeng's modified design was selected unanimously by the First Plenary Session of CPPCC, which changed the flag's name to [...] "Five-star Red Flag".|$|E
