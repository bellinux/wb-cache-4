5|$|Chardonnay {{is a major}} white grape, used in <b>the</b> <b>Vin</b> de Pays d'Oc and the {{sparkling}} Crémant de Limoux. Others include Chenin blanc and Mauzac, {{which is also the}} principal grape in {{the sparkling}} Blanquette de Limoux. The sweet fortified wines of the Muscat de Frontignan and Muscat de St-Jean Minervois regions are made with the Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains grapes. In the Muscat de Rivesaltes AOC, fortified wines are made from Muscat of Alexandria grapes.|$|E
5|$|The Bordeaux wine region {{accounts}} for more than 60% of the Cabernet Sauvignon grown in France. Outside of Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon is found in varying quantities throughout Le Midi and in the Loire Valley. In general, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are lighter and less structured, drinkable much earlier than Bordeaux wine. In the southwest French appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOCs) of Bergerac and Buzet it is used to make rosé wine. In some regions it is used to add flavor and structure to Carignan while it is blended with Négrette in Gaillac and Fronton as well as Tannat in Madiran. In Provence, the grape had some presence in the region in the mid 19th century, when viticulturist Jules Guyot recommended it as a blending partner with Syrah. In recent years, several Midi wine estates, such as Mas de Daumas Gassac have received international acclaim for their Cabernet Sauvignon blended in Hérault, with Rhône grapes like Syrah. It is often made as a single varietal in <b>the</b> <b>vin</b> de pays of the Languedoc. The influence of Australian flying winemakers has been considerable in how Cabernet Sauvignon is treated by some Languedoc wine estates, with some producers making wines that can seem like they are from the New World. Overall, the grape has not exerted it dominance of the region, generally considered less ideally situated to the dry climate than Syrah. The Languedoc producers who give serious consideration to Cabernet Sauvignon, generally rely on irrigation to compensate for the climate.|$|E

25|$|Tradition in Pomerol {{has been}} to {{separate}} the free-run wine and blend back in a proportion of <b>the</b> <b>vin</b> de presse as needed depending on the vintage.

The timing of the blending (such as during or after fermentation) will vary by estate with some houses such as Château Pétrus adding <b>the</b> <b>vin</b> de presse during fermentation in order to allow the wine components to mature together and, theoretically, reduce the harshness of the typically more tannic and phenolic press wine.|$|E

25|$|In France, Chardonnay is the second-most widely planted white grape variety {{just behind}} Ugni blanc and ahead of Sémillon and Sauvignon blanc. The grape first rose to {{prominence}} in the Chablis and Burgundy regions. In Champagne, it is most often blended with Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier, but {{is also used to}} produce single varietal blanc de blancs styles of sparkling wine. Chardonnay can be found in Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) wines of the Loire Valley and Jura wine region, as well as <b>the</b> <b>vin</b> de pays wines of the Languedoc.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century, Pinot Meunier {{was widely}} planted {{throughout}} northern France, {{especially in the}} Paris Basin.

Today, Pinot Meunier is found outside of Champagne in dwindling quantities in the Loire Valley regions of Touraine and Orleans {{as well as the}} Cotes de Toul and Moselle regions.

Other varieties are grown in the region-such as Folle blanche, Cabernet franc, Gamay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot noir and Chenin blanc, Pinot gris, Groslot, and Négrette-but must be used under different designations such as <b>the</b> <b>Vin</b> Délimité de Qualité Supérieure (VDQS) wines of Coteaux d'Ancenis, Fiefs Vendéens or Gros Plant du Pays Nantais.|$|E
