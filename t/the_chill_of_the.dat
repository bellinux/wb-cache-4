2500|$|Hirohito and {{all members}} of the {{imperial}} family implicated in the war such as Prince Chichibu, Prince Asaka, Prince Takeda and Prince Higashikuni were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by MacArthur, with the help of Bonner Fellers who allowed the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment. Some historians criticize this decision. According to John Dower, [...] "with the full support of MacArthur's headquarters, the prosecution functioned, in effect, as a defense team for the emperor" [...] and even Japanese activists who endorse the ideals of the Nuremberg and Tokyo charters, and who have labored to document and publicize the atrocities of the Showa regime [...] "cannot defend the American decision to exonerate the emperor of war responsibility and then, in <b>the</b> <b>chill</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War, release and soon afterwards openly embrace accused right-winged war criminals like the later prime minister Nobusuke Kishi." [...] For Herbert Bix, [...] "MacArthur's truly extraordinary measures to save Hirohito from trial as a war criminal had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on Japanese understanding of the lost war." ...|$|E

5|$|When {{disturbed}} while incubating, {{this bird}} usually (just under 50% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time) partly covers its eggs with nest material when the disruption is not sudden, but a bird with an incomplete clutch usually does {{not attempt to}} cover the eggs. When the disruption is sudden, on the other hand, the black-necked grebe usually (just under 50% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time) does not cover its eggs. In comparison, other species of grebes cover up their eggs when leaving the nest. Predation is usually not <b>the</b> primary cause <b>of</b> egg loss, with most nesting failures occurring after the chicks have hatched.

40|$|Fishing {{technology}} onboard {{fishing vessels}} fishing pelagic species has received increased attention, especially <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> storage method on fish {{quality and the}} vessel’s energy consumption. More flexible storage methods are needed to give higher quality to the landed pelagic species thereby lowering energy consumption and investment costs. Today, when sizing storage systems, high capacity in the pre-chilling period {{is used as a}} designing criteria resulting in large installed refrigeration capacity and limited flexibility. To analyse <b>the</b> demands <b>of</b> better fish quality and lower energy consumption of these systems, a new storage method is simulated to compare it with standard storage methods like refrigerated seawater (RSW) and <b>chilled</b> seawater (CSW). <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simulation is to analyse <b>the</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> catches and operational cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systems to see if combined system (RSW/CSW) gives better results. A mathematical model is developed and applied to simulate a periodic and quasi-steady fishing voyage including a pre-chilling period followed by <b>chilling</b> <b>of</b> one catch. <b>The</b> models are developed in a new software tool, called MarenEDT™, which can handle optimisation of non-linear and non-convex models and simulation of steady-state and transient models.

40|$|This paper studies <b>the</b> {{substitution}} <b>of</b> air condensation {{by water}} condensation in <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> <b>of</b> a university building. This building has a surface of about 30, 000 m 2, {{is located in}} a city <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish north coast, and refrigeration is needed for six months a year. In this paper, the novelty lies in <b>the</b> cooling system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> condensation water, since the typical cooling tower {{is not going to be}} considered; instead, the domestic cold water consumed in the building would be used to cool <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> condensing water. As the domestic water consumption in the building is neither constant nor coincident with <b>the</b> cooling requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chiller,</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire water tank as heat storage was proposed. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> is cooled by the water contained in the fire tank and this fire water is then cooled by the domestic water. With this solution, the reduction in the annual energy consumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> is around 18. 6...|$|R
