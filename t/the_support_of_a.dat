5|$|According to a post-war {{account by}} Karl Strölin, the Oberbürgermeister of Stuttgart at that time, {{he and two}} other conspirators, Alexander von Falkenhausen and Carl Heinrich von Stülpnagel, began efforts to bring Rommel into the anti-Hitler {{conspiracy}} in early 1944. On 15 April 1944 Rommel's new chief of staff, Hans Speidel, arrived in Normandy and reintroduced Rommel to Stülpnagel. Speidel had previously been connected to Carl Goerdeler, the civilian leader of the resistance, {{but not to the}} plotters led by Stauffenberg, and only {{came to the attention of}} Stauffenberg due to his appointment to Rommel's headquarters. The conspirators felt they needed <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> field marshal on active duty, and gave instructions to Speidel to bring Rommel into their circle.|$|E

As other elements from the brigade attacked from the east, No. 3 Commando, now under the command of Peter Bartholomew after Komrower had been posted to the Commando Training Depot, carried out a follow-up operation to the north. The operation was an attack on a factory that had been producing V-2 rockets and after No. 3 Commando had captured it with <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of tanks, a search found a number of these weapons, along with about 100 scientists who had been working in the factory.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ventilator. It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E

5|$|As {{a treaty}} {{document}} {{with a foreign}} nation, the Tyler-Texas annexation treaty required <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> two-thirds majority in the Senate for passage. But in fact, when the Senate voted on the measure on June 8, 1844, fully two-thirds voted against the treaty (16–35). The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted overwhelmingly in favor (15–8). The election campaign had hardened partisan positions on Texas among Democrats. Tyler had anticipated that the measure would fail, due largely to the divisive effects of Secretary Calhoun's Packenham letter. Undeterred, he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty. Congress adjourned before debating the matter.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{enemies in}} {{continental}} Europe had long recognised Ireland as a weak point in Britain's defences. Landing troops {{there was a}} popular strategic goal, not only because an invader could expect <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{large proportion of the}} native population, but also because at least initially they would face fewer and less reliable troops than elsewhere in the British Isles. Additionally, embroiling the British Army in a protracted Irish campaign would reduce its availability for other theatres of war. Finally, French planners considered that a successful invasion of Ireland might act as the ideal platform for a subsequent invasion of Great Britain.|$|E

The Persians, seeking to avoid a battle, beached their fleet below the slopes of Mycale, and, with <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Persian army group, built a palisaded camp.

5|$|Osorkon IV {{ascended to}} the throne of Tanis in c.730 BC, {{at the end of}} the long reign of his {{predecessor}} Shoshenq V of the 22nd Dynasty, who was possibly also his father. However, this somewhat traditional collocation was first challenged in 1970 by Karl-Heinz Priese who preferred to place Osorkon IV in a lower–Egyptian branch of the 23rd Dynasty, right after the reign of the shadowy pharaoh Pedubast II; this placement found <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> certain number of scholars. Osorkon's mother, named on a electrum aegis of Sekhmet now in the Louvre, was Tadibast III. Osorkon IV's realm was restricted only to the district of Tanis (Rˁ-nfr) and the territory of Bubastis, both in the eastern Nile Delta. His neighbors were Libyan princes and Meshwesh chiefs who ruled their small realms outside of his authority.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantines, on {{the other}} hand, were {{weakened}} {{by a series of}} catastrophic defeats against the Bulgars, followed in 820 by the Revolt of Thomas the Slav, which attracted <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large part of the Byzantine armed forces, including the thematic fleets. Despite its suppression, the revolt had severely depleted the Empire's defences. As a result, Crete fell between 824 and 827 to a band of Andalusian exiles. Three successive Byzantine recovery attempts failed over the next few years, and the island became a base for Muslim piratical activity in the Aegean, radically upsetting {{the balance of power in}} the region. Despite some Byzantine successes over the Cretan corsairs, and the razing of Damietta by a Byzantine fleet of 85 ships in 853, Arab naval power in the Levant was steadily reviving under Abbasid rule. Further Byzantine attempts to recover Crete, in 843 and 866, were complete failures.|$|E

The {{conflict was}} marked by a series of four separate Libyan interventions in Chad, taking place in 1978, 1979, 1980–1981 and 1983–1987. In all of these occasions Gaddafi had <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of factions participating in the civil war, while Libya's opponents found the support of the French government, which intervened militarily to save the Chadian government in 1978, 1983 and 1986.|$|E

The Tuscan garrison was heavily outnumbered, but received significant support from British Royal Navy forces who controlled the Mediterranean Sea and ensured that supplies reached the garrison and that French supply convoys were intercepted. The French began the siege with 1,500 men in May 1801, later reinforced to more than 5,000, but could not make an impression on the fortress's defences, instead seeking to starve the defenders into submission with <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> squadron of French Navy frigates operating off the coast.|$|E
