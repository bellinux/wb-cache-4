5|$|Despite the boasting of Mussolini and <b>the</b> <b>fury</b> of Churchill, {{the loss}} of Tug Argan and {{consequently}} Somaliland was not of the greatest strategic importance. Certainly it was a blow to British prestige and pride, but Somaliland was one of Britain's lesser regions of value and could be affordably lost. In fact, Britain incurred monetary gains after being relieved of the necessity to station an expensive garrison there. But the impact could have been far greater if the Italians had managed to move faster after the battle. Heavy rains and difficulties supplying the troops damaged these efforts, as well as removed any chance of a sizable strategic victory.|$|E

Lili also caused a little girl to be born in Massachusetts 2 weeks before her due date. Her mother named her after the storm, Lilly.

The adverts were removed soon after numerous complaints were made by players. In addition to the load time problems, there had been consternation about advertising being retroactively added into a game {{that had already been}} paid for.|$|E

5|$|At the 2012 Penny Arcade Expo (PAX), Game Director Todd Papy, Lead Game Designer Mark Simon, Principal Character Artist Patrick Murphy, {{and writer}} of the God of War series Marianne Krawczyk, hosted the first God of War panel, {{discussing}} the origins of Ascension, and provided {{an overview of the}} evolution of Kratos. <b>The</b> <b>Fury</b> Megaera was revealed, and Mark Simon discussed the new combat system. Papy said he had considered using the goddess Artemis as a playable female character, which would have offered the player alternative combat options. Artemis would have been depicted as half-human and half-feline, with the head and torso of a woman and the legs of a lioness. Artemis was ultimately cut from the game, but Papy {{said he would like to}} explore the possibility of using other gods in the future.|$|E

Continuing his pursuit of the Furies, Kratos reaches the door to Alecto's Chamber, but seemingly returns home {{to his wife and}} daughter: another illusion, this time cast by <b>the</b> <b>Fury</b> Queen Alecto. She tries to convince Kratos he can live within this illusion if he rejoins Ares, but he refuses. Enraged, Alecto and Tisiphone attack Kratos, who retrieves the eyes, and Alecto transforms into a giant sea monster. After a brutal battle, Kratos uses the eyes to break through the Furies' illusions before killing them both, which destroys the prison.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1590s, Lopez was wealthy and {{generally}} respected. He owned a comfortable house in Holborn {{and had his}} youngest son Anthony enrolled at Winchester College.

Learning of this from Pérez, Essex began to assemble evidence implicating Lopez as some sort of fifth columnist in the pay of King Philip II of Spain. The Lord High Treasurer Lord Burghley initially thought Essex's allegations against Lopez absurd; the Queen herself also rebuked Essex.|$|E

5|$|In 1543, several {{conservative}} clergymen in Kent {{banded together}} to attack and denounce two reformers, Richard Turner and John Bland, before the Privy Council. They prepared articles {{to present to the}} Council, but at the last moment, additional denunciations were added by Stephen Gardiner's nephew, Germain Gardiner. These new articles attacked Cranmer and listed his misdeeds back to 1541. This document and the actions that followed were the basis of the so-called Prebendaries' Plot. The articles were delivered to the Council in London and were probably read on 22 April 1543. The king most likely saw the articles against Cranmer that night. The archbishop, however, appeared unaware that an attack on his person was made. His commissioners in Lambeth dealt specifically with Turner's case where he was acquitted, much to <b>the</b> <b>fury</b> of the conservatives.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Dillon (Charles S. Dutton) is <b>the</b> <b>Fury</b> 161 {{preacher and}} {{chaplain}} to the prisoners.

Dillon {{is one of the few}} prisoners to whom Ripley speaks after her arrival; he asks if she has faith, and says that his men have faith enough to accept anyone. He delivers an eloquent eulogy during Newt and Hicks' funeral which touches Ripley. When prisoners try to rape her, Dillon bashes them with a crowbar. Ripley asks Dillon to kill her and the gestating Alien inside her, and he promises to do so when the Alien is dead. Shortly afterwards, Dillon organizes the remaining prisoners to lure the Alien into the foundry and drown it in molten lead. When the Alien attempts to follow Ripley out of the trap, Dillon baits it; when it attacks, Ripley submerges them both in the molten lead.|$|E

40|$|Early Imperial Roman Poetry {{has often}} been {{considered}} almost exclusively derivative of Virgil, and therefore essentially uncreative, on the one hand, and sychophantic towards its patrons, the Roman emperors, on the other. Nevertheless, three poets of this period, Seneca, Lucan, and Statius, possessed an awesome originality which militates against such assessment. To {{understand the nature of}} that originality, the dissertation focuses on one characteristic which these three poets have in common: <b>the</b> <b>Furies.</b> Beginning with a brief survey of <b>the</b> <b>Furies</b> in Greek literature and a consideration of their function in Virgil and Ovid as background, the dissertation analyzes the role of <b>the</b> <b>Furies</b> and how it changes and increases in Seneca 2 ̆ 7 s Tragedies, Lucan 2 ̆ 7 s Bellum Civile, and Statius 2 ̆ 7 Thebaid. It pays particular attention to the language associated with <b>the</b> <b>Furies</b> and how it can be used even when divine Furies are not present. The culmination of the study is Statius 2 ̆ 7 Thebaid, wherein <b>the</b> <b>Furies</b> emerge as <b>the</b> most powerful of all divinities. Jupiter, the ruler of the gods, is revealed as weak and ineffectual, and is ultimately chased from the epic {{along with the rest of}} the pantheon. While the poets increased the power of <b>the</b> <b>Furies,</b> they decreased <b>the</b> power of Jupiter and the rest of the gods. This in turn functioned as an implicit condemnation of the Roman emperors, whom the poets themselves equated with Jupiter. In the works of Seneca, Lucan, and Statius, it is Jupiter who suffers the most at the hands of <b>the</b> <b>Furies.</b> ...|$|R
