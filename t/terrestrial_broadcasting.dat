5|$|In 1995 {{the group}} {{released}} a report, Digital <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> in Australia, containing the preliminary {{conclusions of the}} group. It found that premature regulation of the new platform might stifle the market-driven development of the service, {{that it should be}} based upon existing standards, and should not restrict the ability of broadcasters to tailor local content. It was too early at the time to make decisions relating to what standard should be used, when transmissions should commence, and whether analog television should be phased out.|$|E

5|$|The final report, of {{the same}} name, was {{released}} in 1997. It recommended that Australia should adopt a single system following detailed trials of potential systems, {{that it should be}} implemented with high definition capabilities from the outset, that each licensed commercial or public service should have access to a full 7MHz channel for its services, and that the eventual termination of analog PAL services should be driven by market factors and subject to regular review. The year 2000 was highlighted as a potential target date for the commencement of permanent digital <b>terrestrial</b> <b>broadcasting.</b>|$|E

Network programmes were now classed as Carlton UK Productions and around 140 jobs were lost from the downgraded Birmingham operation.|$|E
25|$|The DRS {{undertook}} <b>terrestrial</b> <b>broadcasting</b> {{for large}} cities and direct broadcasting to SITE television sets for remote villages. However, {{it did not}} provide for small towns where the TV set density was {{higher than in the}} villages while not as much as in a city. The concept of a low-power limited rebroadcast (LRB) TV transmitter system was evolved to overcome such situations. The LRB consisted of a simple receiver system having a 4.5m chicken-mesh parabolic antenna with a low-noise block converter, that served as the front-end for a low-power TV transmitter at the same location. Two suitable locations, Sambalpur in Orissa (75 villages) and Muzaffarpur in Bihar (110 villages), were tentatively identified for implementing LRB transmitter systems. This experiment was expected to provide useful data on the trade-off between DRS and LRB. However, due to financial constraints, these two LRBs had to be shelved, and instead an LRB was set up at SHAR, Sriharikota.|$|E
