50|$|The {{body section}} of the Coni-Snap design has a <b>tapered</b> <b>rim</b> to {{facilitate}} encapsulation on high-speed capsule-filling machines. It has a dual snap-ring locking system that provides an initial attachment prior to capsule filling and a final closure of the filled capsule. The Coni-Snap design also includes air vents to avoid unwanted air compression within the capsule during high speed filling.|$|E
50|$|Trains and trams {{can turn}} corners without wheel-slip because the outer {{horizontal}} {{part of the}} wheels has a slightly <b>tapered</b> <b>rim.</b> The guide flange (ridge) is on the inside to prevent the vehicle from slipping sideways off the rails. The horizontal (cone-shaped) rim makes contact with the slightly convex top of a steel rail in different (horizontal) places so that the outer wheel has a larger effective diameter than the inner wheel.|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic spool valves {{are found}} in most {{hydraulic}} circuits in which flow is to be modulated. Therefore their dynamic performance {{is critical to the}} overall performance of the circuit. Fundamental to this performance is the presence of flow reaction forces which act on the spool. These forces can result in the necessity of using two stage devices to drive the spool and in some cases have been directly linked to valve and circuit instabilities. As such, a great deal of research and design has concentrated on ways to reduce or compensate for flow forces. In one particular series of studies conducted on flow divider valves, it was established that a rim machined into the land of the spool reduced the flow dividing error by approximately 70 - 80 %, and it was deduced that the main contribution to this error was flow forces. Direct verification of the claim regarding flow force reduction was not achieved and hence was the motivation for this particular study. This thesis will consider the reaction (flow) force associated with a conventional spool land and one with a rim machined into it, and a modified form of the rimmed land referred to as a “sharp edge <b>tapered</b> <b>rim</b> spool land”. The rim and the sharp edge <b>tapered</b> <b>rim</b> were specially designed geometrical changes to the lands of the standard spool {{in order to reduce the}} large steady state flow forces (SSFF) inherent in the standard spool valve. In order to analyze the flow field inside the interior passages of the valve, three configurations of the spool were considered for orifice openings of 0. 375, 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 05 mm. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was used to describe the fluid mechanics associated with the steady state flow forces as it provided a detailed structure of the flow through the valve, and to identify the flow mechanism whereby flow forces are reduced by the machining of a rim and <b>tapered</b> <b>rim</b> on the land of the spool. For all openings of the spool, the sharp <b>tapered</b> <b>rim</b> valve provides the largest reduction in SSFF. It was also observed that for all cases studied, the inflow SSFF’s were smaller than for the outflow conditions. The prediction of the steady state flow force on the rim spool was investigated in a flow divider valve configuration, and the results from the CFD analysis indicated a reduction by approximately 70 %...|$|E

5|$|The kulintang gong {{itself is}} {{believed}} to have been one of those foreign musical elements incorporated into kulintang music, derived from the Sundanese kolenang due to its striking similarities. Along with the fact that they play important roles in their respectively ensembles, both the kulintang and kolenang show striking homogeneity in <b>tapered</b> <b>rims</b> (as opposed to pronouncedly tapered Javanese bonang and non-tapered Laotian khong vong gongs). Even the word kulintang {{is believed to}} be just an altered form of the Sundanese word kolenang.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{pre-compression}} {{that develops}} in a press-fit multi-rim rotor suppresses tensile stresses {{caused by the}} curing process and high speed rotational centrifugal forces, increasing the overall performance of the flywheel rotor. In this study, the interferences and the rim thickness of up to five rims of graphite/Ep and glass/Ep are analyzed to maximize the specific energy density (SED) of a multi-rim composite flywheel rotor. Three states are considered: (a) cured rims with residual stress prior to press-fitting; (b) a stationary press-fitted rotor; (c) a rotor at maximum rotational speed. Two methods of press-fitting rims are presented. One method has each <b>rim</b> machined with <b>tapered</b> inner and outer rim surfaces. The other method uses a guiding rim to expand the outer rim and guide the inner rim into the expanded outer rim. An optimized multi-rim rotor, composed of one glass/Ep rim and one graphite/Ep rim, is scaled to have energy storage capability of 5 kWh, and is successfully manufactured by machining <b>tapered</b> <b>rims</b> and hydraulic pressing. KEY WORDS: flywheel rotor, filament winding, residual stresses, computational simulation...|$|R
5000|$|Clarence B. Moore, {{who visited}} the site in 1908, {{described}} Mound A as being 25 ft tall, although by the 1950s it had been significantly reduced in height. Mound B has been almost completely leveled, although a small rise can be discerned. Mound C is roughly 12 ft tall. Mounds A and C are both roughly 120 ft sq. Pottery sampling in the 1950s from Mound A gave the site a historical importance out of all proportion to its size. Test pits from a 1949 excavation of the Holly Bluff Site produced an important glimpse of a late [...] "transitional" [...] Coles Creek to Plaquemine assemblage featuring thin <b>tapered</b> <b>rims</b> of polished plain ware and carefully executed varieties of Coles Creek incised and associated types. Although intriguing as pottery, it was not sufficiently integrated strategraphically to postulate a distinct phase. Site sampling from the Kings Crossing Site in 1954 supplied the integration and gave the phase a name. Since then, especially in the Tensas Basin, it {{has become one of}} the firmest and most easily identifiable ceramic complexes in the Lower Mississippi area.|$|R

5000|$|Critical {{cartridge}} specifications include neck size, {{bullet weight}} and caliber, maximum pressure, headspace, overall length, case body diameter and <b>taper,</b> shoulder design, <b>rim</b> type, etc. Generally, every {{characteristic of a}} specific cartridge type is tightly controlled and few types are interchangeable in any way. Exceptions do exist but generally, these are only where a shorter cylindrical rimmed cartridge {{can be used in}} a longer chamber, (e.g., [...]22 Short in [...]22 Long Rifle chamber, and [...]38 Special in a [...]357 Magnum chamber). Centerfire primer type (Boxer or Berdan, see below) is interchangeable, although not in the same case. Deviation in any of these specifications can result in firearm damage and, in some instances, injury or death. Similarly, use of the wrong type of cartridge in any given gun can damage the gun, or cause bodily injury.|$|R
