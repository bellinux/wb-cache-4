In exploring parallel exemplar, it is possible to identify how the key characteristics of Live Projects were an attempt to create a more pedagogically as well as practically speculative space. This chapter will subsequently consider whether Live Projects provide by their very existence a critical checklist of missing professional learning from Design Studio, such as client engagement and teamwork. Furthermore, it will examine whether the validating criterion provided by the UK’s RIBA and the US’ NAAB and NCARB necessarily imposes limitations on Live Projects or whether they provide an <b>tacit</b> <b>mandate</b> for their wider adoption across architectural education...|$|E
