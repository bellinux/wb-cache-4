5|$|<b>The</b> <b>observed</b> {{power output}} of 4.7 gigawatts is {{challenging}} to explain from tidal heating alone, so {{the main source}} of heat remains a mystery.

5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon mounting bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in <b>the</b> <b>observed</b> manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that <b>the</b> <b>observed</b> damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|E

50|$|The preparative state, with {{unspecified}} phase, leaves {{room for}} the {{several members of the}} ensemble to interact in respectively several various ways with other systems. An example is when an individual system is passed to an observing device so as to interact with it. Individual systems with various phases are scattered in various respective directions in the analyzing part of <b>the</b> <b>observing</b> device, in a probabilistic way. In each such direction, a detector is placed, in order to complete the observation. When the system hits the analyzing part of <b>the</b> <b>observing</b> device, that scatters it, it ceases to be adequately described by its own wave function in isolation. Instead it interacts with <b>the</b> <b>observing</b> device in ways partly determined by the properties of <b>the</b> <b>observing</b> device. In particular, there is in general no phase coherence between system and observing device. This lack of coherence introduces an element of probabilistic randomness to the system-device interaction. It is this randomness that is described by the probability calculated by the Born rule. There are two independent originative random processes, one that of preparative phase, the other that of the phase of <b>the</b> <b>observing</b> device. <b>The</b> random process that is actually observed, however, is neither of those originative ones. It is the phase difference between them, a single derived random process.|$|R
