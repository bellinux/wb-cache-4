5|$|Meanwhile, an {{intrusive}} {{public works}} inspector (Carter Jahncke) tests {{the air quality}} at the squad room, but insists to an inquisitive Gee <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> fine. The next day, however, Gee goes upstairs and finds a team wearing protective respirator suits removing hazardous asbestos from the wall. Gee angrily confronts Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) for not informing the detectives about the work, and demands it be stopped until precautionary medical checks can be conducted. Barnfather and Granger insist the removal work is safe, but give in when Gee threatens {{to go to the}} media. Meanwhile, Lewis (Clark Johnson) brags repeatedly to Crosetti (Jon Polito) about his new Ford FE V8 engine and the car he plans to build. Crosetti feigns disinterest, but the next day presents Lewis with a rear-view mirror as a gift.|$|E
5|$|On {{the way to}} Seville, Kabir drops Natasha at the airport, while Arjun and Imran {{notice that}} {{something}} is wrong between them. Imran later reassures his friends <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> okay. The trio visit Seville for sky diving, Arjun's choice. During the task, Imran is forced to confront his acrophobia and hesitates to take part. However, they complete it without any obstacles. After skydiving, the three men go to a bar and get into a fight with a stranger on whom they had tried to pull a prank. They are jailed after the fight. After Laila and Nuria do not answer their calls to bail them out, Imran reluntantly proceeds to call Salman Habib. Salman bails them out and takes them to his home. While speaking to Imran, Salman reveals that he never wanted the responsibility of a married life with kids, while Imran's mother did, which is why he never contacted Imran. Imran, heartbroken, realises how his actions must have hurt Arjun four years back. He earnestly apologises to Arjun, and Arjun, seeing the genuineness of the apology, forgives him with a hug.|$|E

25|$|Peter Kreeft and Ronald Tacelli, SJ, both {{professors of}} {{philosophy}} at Boston College, have also expanded the argument into a tetralemma ("Lord, Liar, Lunatic or Legend") — or a pentalemma, accommodating the option that Jesus was a guru, who believed {{himself to be}} God in the sense <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> divine.|$|E

25|$|Panpsychism is the {{philosophical}} view held by many pantheists that consciousness, mind, or soul {{is a universal}} feature of all things. Some pantheists also subscribe to the distinct philosophical views hylozoism (or panvitalism), the view <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> alive, and its close neighbor animism, the view that everything has a soul or spirit.|$|E

With all the traffic passing by, the Inn is a perfect cover for Company {{research}} and other work. However, when Mendoza arrives, the main problem is lighting a fire to cook dinner, given <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> soaked by the rain.|$|E
25|$|During a {{greeting}} ritual, {{the person who}} has entered the contact answers a series of questions about his or her whole family, from the person who was already there. The answer is sewa, which means <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> fine. Then the Dogon who has entered the contact repeats the ritual, asking the resident how his or her whole family is. Because the word sewa is so commonly repeated throughout a Dogon village, neighboring peoples have dubbed the Dogon the sewa people.|$|E

25|$|In December 2015, British media buzzed {{about the}} group embarking on a stint in Las Vegas, {{starting}} 2017. Reports indicated the group impressed U.S. promoters and would headline their own residency show. Many venues circulated, including The AXIS at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino, The Foundry at SLS Las Vegas and the Linq Theater at The LINQ Hotel & Casino. Local newspaper, the Las Vegas Sun writes <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> still unconfirmed, despite Barlow confirming the rumour on Twitter.|$|E
25|$|As a {{religious}} position, some describe pantheism as the polar opposite of atheism. From this standpoint, pantheism {{is the view}} <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> part of an all-encompassing, immanent God. All forms of reality may then be considered either modes of that Being, or identical with it. Some hold that pantheism is a non-religious philosophical position. To them, pantheism is {{the view that the}} Universe (in the sense of the totality of all existence) and God are identical (implying a denial of the personality and transcendence of God).|$|E
25|$|With the way <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> being done, {{with people}} like Trent Reznor and Radiohead, it was very inspiring to us that when you're doing things on your own you can do {{whatever}} you want. Not that we're going to give records away but this time we're starting a label, we want to build it up first and have the freedom to release exclusive things whenever we want. That's something we've always been able to do until we were on Epic, so it's nice that we're able to do that again.|$|E

25|$|Causal determinism: The idea <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> {{caused by}} prior conditions, making it {{impossible}} for anything else to happen. In its most common form, nomological (or scientific) determinism, future events are necessitated by past and present events combined with the laws of nature. Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the thought experiment of Laplace's demon. Imagine an entity that knows all facts about the past and the present, and knows all natural laws that govern the universe. If the laws of nature were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.|$|E
25|$|First, the {{movement}} system (and turn structure with it) departs {{from the traditional}} 'everyone takes a turn in order' structure used {{in the vast majority}} of games. Instead a proportional movement system is used, where a little bit of the total movement (termed an impulse, 32 of which comprise each game turn) for all players is resolved simultaneously, so that each can see what is happening and respond to it. This avoids the usual problems with moving long distances without any fire or reactions happening, and keeps in mind <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> moving at the same time. This system produces two important and well-known effects for movement: on impulse #1 of the game turn no units move (starships are restricted to speed 31 or less) and on impulse #32 (the last) all units move. The former instance means that speed-32 seeking weapons one hex from their targets hit automatically without possibility of interception, and targets at the range limit of overloaded torpedoes (8 hexes) cannot escape before taking fire. The latter instance means that even the slowest units in play make a move on the turn's final impulse.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{hypothesis}} {{for the cause}} of motion sickness is that it functions as a defense mechanism against neurotoxins. The area postrema in the brain is responsible for inducing vomiting when poisons are detected, and for resolving conflicts between vision and balance. When feeling motion but not seeing it (for example, in a ship with no windows), the inner ear transmits to the brain that it senses motion, but the eyes tell the brain <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> still. As a result of the discordance, the brain will {{come to the conclusion that}} the individual is hallucinating and further conclude that the hallucination is due to poison ingestion. The brain responds by inducing vomiting, to clear the supposed toxin. Treisman's indirect argument has recently been questioned via an alternative direct evolutionary hypothesis, as well as modified and extended via a direct poison hypothesis. The direct evolutionary hypothesis essentially argues that there are plausible means by which ancient real or apparent motion could have contributed directly to the evolution of aversive reactions, without the need for the co-opting of a poison response as posited by Treisman. Nevertheless, the direct poison hypothesis argues that there still are plausible ways in which the body's poison response system may have played a role in shaping the evolution of some of the signature symptoms that characterize motion sickness.|$|E
