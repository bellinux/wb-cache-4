5|$|By September, several Blenheims were {{equipped}} {{with what was}} now officially known as AI Mk. I and training of the crews began with No. 25 Squadron at RAF Northolt. Robert Hanbury Brown, a physicist who would later work on radar in the US, and Keith Wood joined them in August 1939, helping fitters keep the systems operational, {{and coming up with}} useful methods for interception. Near the end of August, Dowding visited the base and saw the radars in the nose and pointed out to Bowen that the enemy gunners would see <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> CRTs and shoot the operator. The sets were re-fitted once again, returning {{to the rear of the}} fuselage, which caused more delays.|$|E

5|$|On March 22, 2005, NASA {{released}} {{news that}} infrared {{light from the}} planet had been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope, the first ever direct detection of light from an extrasolar planet. This was done by subtracting the parent star's constant light and noting the difference as the planet transited {{in front of the}} star and was eclipsed behind it, providing a measure of <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> planet itself. New measurements from this observation determined the planet's temperature as at least 750°C (1300°F). The circular orbit of HD 209458 b was also confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the universe, {{hydrogen}} is mostly {{found in the}} atomic and plasma states, with properties quite {{different from those of}} molecular hydrogen. As a plasma, hydrogen's electron and proton are not bound together, resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity (producing <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sun and other stars). The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind they interact with the Earth's magnetosphere giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora. Hydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the interstellar medium. The large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped Lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the Universe up to redshift z=4.|$|E
5|$|Depth and {{dimension}} are rendered {{by the use}} {{of linear}} perspective, by the overlapping of the layers of shapes, and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. The pictorial space in the midground and foreground is lit from two sources: by thin shafts of light from the open door, and by broad streams coming through the window to the right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic Michel Foucault observed that <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> window illuminates both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.|$|E

5|$|Galileo is lesser known for, {{yet still}} {{credited}} with, {{being one of}} the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We now know that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).|$|E
25|$|The Dwingeloo 1 galaxy was {{discovered}} in 1994 by the Dwingeloo Obscured Galaxy Survey (DOGS), which searched for neutral hydrogen (HI) radio emissions at the wavelength of 21cm from objects in the Zone of Avoidance.

25|$|The {{notion of}} path {{difference}} and constructive or destructive interference used above for the double-slit experiment applies {{as well to}} the display of a single slit of light intercepted on a screen. The main result of this interference is to spread out <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> narrow slit into a broader image on the screen. This distribution of wave energy is called diffraction.|$|E

25|$|The playing area used {{to feature}} pitches laid on an east–west axis.

25|$|Because {{a science}} target is often too faint {{to be used}} as a {{reference}} star for measuring the shape of the optical wavefronts, a nearby brighter guide star can be used instead. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> science target has passed through approximately the same atmospheric turbulence as the reference star's light and so its image is also corrected, although generally to a lower accuracy.|$|E
25|$|Walther Ritz's {{emission}} theory (or ballistic theory), {{was also}} consistent {{with the results of}} the experiment, not requiring aether. The theory postulates that light has always the same velocity in respect to the source. However de Sitter noted that emitter theory predicted several optical effects that were not seen in observations of binary stars in which <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> two stars could be measured in a spectrometer. If emission theory were correct, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stars should experience unusual fringe shifting due to the velocity of the stars being added to the speed of the light, but no such effect could be seen. It was later shown by J. G. Fox that the original de Sitter experiments were flawed due to extinction, but in 1977 Brecher observed X-rays from binary star systems with similar null results. Also terrestrial tests using particle accelerators have been made that were inconsistent with source dependence of the speed of light. In addition, Emission theory might fail the Ives–Stilwell experiment, but Fox questioned that as well.|$|E

25|$|Placing {{the flash}} {{away from the}} camera's optical axis ensures that <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> flash hits the eye at an oblique angle. The light enters the eye in a {{direction}} away from the optical axis of the camera and is refocused by the eye lens back along the same axis. Because of this the retina will not be visible to the camera and the eyes will appear natural.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the dome was possibly intended to symbolize the arched vault of the heavens. The oculus at the dome's apex and the entry door are the only natural sources {{of light in the}} interior. Throughout the day, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> oculus moves around this space in a reverse sundial effect. The oculus also serves as a cooling and ventilation method.

25|$|Color {{temperature}} can be {{indicated in}} kelvins or mireds (1 million {{divided by the}} color temperature in kelvins). The color temperature of a light source is the temperature of a black body that has the same chromaticity (i.e. color) as the light source. A notional temperature, the correlated color temperature, the temperature of a black body which emits light of a hue which to human color perception most closely matches <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lamp, is assigned.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century it was {{discovered}} that, when decomposing <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sun, a multitude of spectral lines were observed (regions where there was less or no light).

25|$|The major {{components}} of an ERS light are the casing {{in which the}} internal parts are mounted, an ellipsoidal reflector located {{in the back of}} the casing, a lamp mounted to position the filament at the rear focal point of the ellipsoid, a dual plano-convex lens (two plano-convex lenses facing each other in the barrel), and at the front, a gel frame to hold the color gel. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lamp is efficiently gathered by the ellipsoidal reflector and sent forward through the gate, shutters and lens system.|$|E
