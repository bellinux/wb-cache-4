5|$|AAC {{systems for}} this {{population}} generally begin with communication boards and/or object or picture exchanges such as the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). A 2009 descriptive review provided preliminary evidence that PECS is easily learned by most individuals with autism, provides communication to those {{with little or no}} functional speech, and has some limited positive impact on social interaction and challenging behaviours. A study that compared the use of a speech generating device <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> exchange system found that both were reasonable options for children with autism, as the ease and speed of acquisition of each system was similar.|$|E
5|$|The sitter is unknown, {{although}} some art historians have speculated on her identity. On {{the grounds of}} similarity of facial features, writer Wilhelm Stein suggested in the early 20th century {{that she might be}} Marie de Valengin, the illegitimate daughter of Philip the Good of Burgundy. However, this is a contentious assertion and not widely held. Because her hands are shown as resting on the painting's lower frame, art historians generally accept that this was an independent portrait, rather than a devotional work. It is possible that it was intended as a pendant <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of the woman's husband, however no other portrait has been suggested as a likely companion.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Nima Nourizadeh and released on 11 December 2006. It opens with an aerial shot of a piano which begins to play by itself, and then moves to reveal a film set. Allen stands on a lamppost, wearing a raincoat, with lights, a camera and directors surrounding her. The image zooms into the camera from the studio and turns the video black-and-white, with the story coming to life, as the singer begins the first verse. From the lamppost {{she is able to}} see her former self walking down the street with her boyfriend. While they enter a building, a light comes out in one of the windows, revealing their silhouettes kissing. The caption changes, with the two of them dancing, while a man plays the piano in the background; as he dips her and holds this position, she continues to sing. The camera zooms out to see a heart shaped window surrounding the two that opens and changes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> on Allen's wall. She is alone in a room, staring at a mirror. Her hair is let down and she is wearing a white nightgown. The piano is seen again playing itself, as the image shifts to the window, where Allen is again portrayed leaning against the lamppost in the street, as {{in the beginning of the}} video. She again looks at the silhouettes in the window of the building, as it collapses on her, once again changing the scene. This time, the singer is looking through another window, and then turns around to a mirror which captures a door. The former Allen with the raincoat walks through with her boyfriend, as their shadows are seen kissing. The image changes to Allen from the film set, zooming out from the camera's viewing piece, making the video in colour again.|$|E

5|$|The {{widespread}} use of conscription, the compulsory recruitment of soldiers' sons, the relaxation of age and height requirements and the branding of recruits all add up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of an army that had severe difficulties in finding, and retaining, sufficient recruits. Recruitment difficulties are confirmed in the legal code evidence: there are measures to deal with cases of self-mutilation to avoid military service (such as cutting off a thumb), including an extreme decree of 386 requiring such persons to be burnt alive. Desertion was clearly a serious problem, and was probably much worse than in {{the army of the}} Principate, since the latter was mainly a volunteer army. This is supported {{by the fact that the}} granting of leave of absence (commeatus) was more strictly regulated. While in the 2nd century, a soldier's leave was granted at the discretion of his regimental commander, in the 4th century, leave could only be granted by a far senior officer (dux, comes or magister militum). In addition, it appears that comitatus units were typically one-third understrength. The massive disparity between official and actual strength is powerful evidence of recruitment problems. Against this, Elton argues that the late army did not have serious recruitment problems, on the basis of the large numbers of exemptions from conscription that were granted.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{interesting}} to note that wood collage in a sense made its debut, indirectly, {{at the same time as}} paper collage, since (according to the Guggenheim online), Georges Braque initiated use of paper collage by cutting out pieces of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and attaching them to his own charcoal drawings. Thus, the idea of gluing wood <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> was implicitly there from the start, since the paper used in the very first paper collages was a commercial product manufactured to look like wood.|$|E

25|$|The troops {{surrounded}} the Prime Minister's residence and forced its guards {{to open the}} gates. Upon entering the compound and attempting to find the Prime Minister, however, they were fired upon by four policemen. All four were killed after wounding six of the rebel soldiers, but the gunfire succeeded in warning Okada of the danger. He was spirited into hiding by his brother-in-law, Col. Denzō Matsuo. Matsuo, who {{was said to have}} resembled Okada, was then discovered and killed by the troops. The soldiers compared Matsuo's wounded face <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of the Prime Minister and concluded that they had succeeded in their mission. Okada would escape the next day, but this fact was kept a secret and he played no further role in the incident. After Matsuo's death, Kurihara's men assumed guard positions around the compound. They were joined by 60 men from the 3rd Imperial Guard (see below).|$|E
25|$|Moments later, Gold asks Fiona {{to reopen}} the {{investigation}} into Belle’s disappearance. As Fiona tries {{to talk him out}} of it, she shows him pictures of Belle enjoying life in other countries, and wants Gold to move on from Belle. Back in the Enchanted Forest, Hook and David began their search for the magic beans and Hook finds one, only to encounter a dragon. The creature chases them down the beanstalk after they take the bean. At the hospital, Henry wakes up and discovers that Fiona is manipulating Emma during their visit. Afterwards, Fiona finally succeeds in convincing Emma to burn the storybook in the furnace as Fiona tells Emma it's the only way to keep Henry safe and to end the delusions. Thanks to Fiona's scheme, most of the realms depicted in the book are consumed by Darkness (at least 17 realms), and the Darkness arrives on the outskirts of the Enchanted Forest, in the form of a massive storm of Dark Magic. However, as the book is burning, the pages flip <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of Hook, and Emma stares at his image as the flames consume the page.|$|E

500|$|Patrick Henry College {{is located}} in the town of Purcellville in rural {{northern}} Virginia, approximately [...] northwest of Washington D.C. The campus currently consists of seven buildings arranged around a retention pond popularly called [...] "Lake Bob", as well as several athletic fields. The oldest structure, Founders Hall, opened in 2000 and contains three classrooms, the college library, and various administrative and faculty offices. It is also home to the offices of the Home School Legal Defense Association. Hanna Rosin, author of God's Harvard, described the campus as [...] "tiny, less like an Ivy League college than like a Hollywood set of an old Ivy League school." [...] The buildings are of Colonial Revival architecture. The artwork in Founders Hall consists of copies of portraits of the Founding Fathers placed along a staircase, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of Patrick Henry at the second Virginia convention which features a light from heaven guiding Henry's speech. The artwork is designed to, in the words of Hanna Rosin, [...] "remind the students that America was founded as a Christian nation." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{facts of}} {{what took place}} in the store are still disputed. [...] According to what Jones said at the time, the other boys {{reported}} that Till had a photograph of an integrated class at the school he attended in Chicago, and Till bragged to the boys that the white children in the picture were his friends. He pointed to a white girl in the picture, or referred <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of a white girl that had come with his new wallet, and said she was his girlfriend and {{one or more of the}} local boys dared Till to speak to Bryant. However, writing a personal account of the incident in a book released in 2009, Till's cousin Simeon Wright, who was also present, disputed Jones' version of what happened on that day. According to Wright, Till did not have a photo of a white girl in his wallet and no one dared him to flirt with Bryant. Speaking in 2015, Wright said, [...] "We didn't dare him to go to the store — the white folk said that. They said that he had pictures of his white girlfriend. There were no pictures. They never talked to me. They never interviewed me." [...] The FBI report completed in 2006 notes [...] "...Jones recanted his 1955 statements prior to his death and apologized to Mamie Till-Mobley".|$|E
500|$|John Knox's {{chaplaincy}} of {{the castle}} garrison was not to last long. While Hamilton was willing to negotiate with England to stop their support of the rebels and bring the castle back under his control, Mary of Guise decided {{that it could be}} taken only by force and requested the king of France, Henry II to intervene. On 29 June 1547, 21 French galleys approached St Andrews under the command of Leone Strozzi, prior of Capua. The French besieged the castle and forced the surrender of the garrison on 31 July. The Protestant nobles and others, including Knox, were taken prisoner and forced to row in the French galleys. The galley slaves were chained to benches and rowed throughout the day without a change of posture while an officer watched over them with a whip in hand. They sailed to France and navigated up the Seine to Rouen. The nobles, some of whom would have an impact later in Knox's life such as William Kirkcaldy and Henry Balnaves, were sent to various castle-prisons in France. Knox and the other galley slaves continued to Nantes and stayed on the Loire throughout the winter. They were threatened with torture if they did not give proper signs of reverence when mass was performed on the ship. Knox recounted an incident in which one Scot—possibly himself, as he tended to narrate personal anecdotes in the third person—was required to show devotion <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of the Virgin Mary. The prisoner was told to give it a kiss of veneration. He refused and when the picture was pushed up to his face, the prisoner seized the picture and threw it into the sea, saying, [...] "Let our Lady now save herself: she is light enough: let her learn to swim." [...] After that, according to Knox, the Scottish prisoners were no longer forced to perform such devotions.|$|E
