5|$|Stafford {{held the}} comital title for only three months. In July {{he was sent}} north to quell a {{rebellion}} instigated by the discontented Earl of Warwick. Even though he escaped <b>the</b> <b>disastrous</b> Battle of Edgecote, he was executed by a mob at Bridgwater on 17 August 1469. Considered an overambitious man by many, Stafford was nevertheless a capable administrator, who enjoyed the absolute confidence of the king.|$|E
5|$|The Continental Army, {{which had}} invaded Quebec in September 1775, {{suffered}} a severe blow in <b>the</b> <b>disastrous</b> attack on Quebec City on New Year's Eve in 1775. Following that loss, Benedict Arnold and {{the remnants of}} the army besieged Quebec until May 1776.|$|E

5|$|The later {{experiences}} of the Canadian Army during <b>the</b> <b>disastrous</b> Dieppe Raid of 1942, American forces on Omaha Beach on D-Day and taking on Japanese defenders on Pacific Islands showed that under the right conditions, a defender could exact a terrible price from assaulting forces, significantly depleting and delaying enemy forces until reinforcements could be deployed to appropriate places via the sea and inland.|$|E
5|$|Although San Francisco {{had sought}} Tuolumne River water {{as early as}} the 1890s, this project did not move forward until <b>the</b> <b>disastrous</b> {{earthquake}} and fire of 1906, which underscored the insufficiency of the existing water supply. The Hetch Hetchy Valley – then compared to Yosemite Valley for its scenic beauty – was chosen for its water quality and hydroelectric potential, but the location within the national park generated controversy. An act of Congress was required to circumvent federal protection of the Tuolumne River, with the reasoning that public land should be developed for the public benefit.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it allowed}} the militia men to draw Native American blood in revenge, {{the result of}} the battle was {{inconclusive}} with respect to its original purpose of stopping the Native American raids in the area. The men of the militia returned triumphantly to Galena, Illinois bearing the scalps of two Sauk warriors they had slain. The battle helped raise public opinion towards the militia. After <b>the</b> <b>disastrous</b> defeat at Stillman's Run in May, the battle at Yellow Creek coupled with the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, helped to demonstrate that the militia could stand up to and defeat Black Hawk's warriors.|$|E

5|$|An {{energetic}} and ambitious ruler, Michael Shishman led an aggressive but opportunistic and inconsistent foreign policy against the Byzantine Empire and the Kingdom of Serbia, {{which ended in}} <b>the</b> <b>disastrous</b> battle of Velbazhd which claimed his own life. He was the last medieval Bulgarian ruler who aimed at military and political hegemony of the Bulgarian Empire over the Balkans {{and the last one}} who attempted to seize Constantinople. He was succeeded by his son Ivan Stephen and later by his nephew Ivan Alexander, who reversed his policy by forming an alliance with Serbia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} end of the Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, cities in the {{highlands}} and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation in the production of stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline has been linked to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with <b>the</b> <b>disastrous</b> eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E
5|$|At this time, and {{following}} <b>the</b> <b>disastrous</b> Battle of Acheloos in 917, the Byzantines were mostly occupied in the Balkans in a protracted conflict against Bulgaria. Hence, Kourkouas's first task as Domestic of the East was {{the suppression of}} the revolt of Bardas Boilas, the governor (strategos) of Chaldia, a strategically important area on the Empire's northeastern Anatolian frontier. This was quickly achieved and his brother, Theophilos Kourkouas, replaced Boilas as governor of Chaldia. As commander of this northernmost sector of the eastern frontier, Theophilos proved a competent soldier and gave valuable assistance to his brother's campaigns.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{lacking the}} {{resources}} to defeat the US breakthrough and simultaneous British and Canadian offensives south of Caumont and Caen, Field Marshal Günther von Kluge, the commander of Army Group B, was not permitted by Hitler to withdraw but was ordered to conduct a counter-offensive at Mortain against the US breakthrough. Four depleted panzer divisions were not enough to defeat the First US Army. <b>The</b> <b>disastrous</b> Operation Lüttich drove the Germans deeper into the Allied envelopment.|$|E
5|$|Edward III (13 November 1312– 21 June 1377) was King of England from 25 January 1327 {{until his}} death; he is noted for his {{military}} success and for restoring royal authority after <b>the</b> <b>disastrous</b> and unorthodox reign of his father, EdwardII. EdwardIII transformed the Kingdom of England {{into one of}} the most formidable military powers in Europe. His long reign of 50 years was the second longest in medieval England and saw vital developments in legislation and government—in particular the evolution of the English parliament—as well as the ravages of the Black Death.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>disastrous</b> Battle of the Kasserine Pass, Eisenhower sent Smith {{forward to}} report on the state of affairs at the American II Corps.

On their advice, Eisenhower replaced Fredendall with Major General George S. Patton, Jr. Eisenhower also relieved his Assistant Chief of Staff Intelligence (G-2), Brigadier Eric Mockler-Ferryman, pinpointing faulty intelligence at AFHQ as a contributing factor in the defeat at Kasserine. Mockler-Ferryman was replaced by Brigadier Kenneth Strong.|$|E

5|$|In 1620 the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Osman II {{declared}} {{a war against}} the Commonwealth. At <b>the</b> <b>disastrous</b> Battle of Ţuţora Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski was killed and the Commonwealth's situation in respect to the Turkish-Tatar invasion forces became very precarious. A mobilization in Poland-Lithuania followed and when Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz's army withstood fierce enemy assaults at the Battle of Khotyn (1621), the situation improved on the southeastern front. More warfare with the Ottomans followed in 1633–1634 and vast expanses of the Commonwealth had been subjected to Tatar incursions and slave-taking expeditions throughout the period.|$|E

In 1317, however, while returning from a papal embassy to Avignon, he was captured by a Jean de Lamouilly, and held for ransom in Germany. The ransom of £10,400 was to cause Pembroke significant financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.|$|E
