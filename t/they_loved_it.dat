Bogdanovich's agent, Jeff Berg, set up a special screening of his client's soon-to-be released The Last Picture Show (1971) for Foster with McQueen in attendance. <b>They</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> and met with the director and a deal was made. However, Warner Bros. approached Bogdanovich with an offer to direct What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand, with the stipulation {{that he had to}} start right away. The director wanted to do both, and the studio refused. When McQueen found out, he became upset and told Bogdanovich {{that he was going to}} get someone else to direct The Getaway.|$|E
500|$|There {{was this}} huge scandal that {{originally}} [...] "Halo" [...] {{was meant to}} go to Leona. That was never the case... That song was written for Beyoncé. What happened was that Beyoncé waited long enough to record that song... I thought {{this would be a}} brilliant first single for Leona, which it would have... What I did was foolishly say to Leona's camp, [...] "I have it on hold for another A-list artist and I'm pretty sure they'll take it, but if they don't, I just {{want to know if you}} like it enough to consider it". I sent it to them and they flipped on it. <b>They</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> and instantly said they wanted to do it. I was like, [...] "Wait, wait, wait, no, it's not free yet!" ...|$|E
500|$|English {{rock group}} the Yardbirds {{recorded}} [...] "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] {{during their first}} American tour in 1965. [...] It is based on Johnny Burnette's adaptation, but Beck biographer Annette Carson comments their [...] "propulsive, power-driven version, however, deviated radically from the original... recording plucked the old Rock & Roll Trio number from obscurity {{and turned it into}} a classic among classics". [...] The Yardbirds' lead guitarist Jeff Beck, who is a fan of early rockabilly, said that he introduced the song to the group: [...] "They just heard me play the riff, and <b>they</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> and made up their version of it". [...] Giorgio Gomelsky, the group' first producer, states that Sonny Boy Williamson II's use of blues harp to imitate train sounds during his 1963 UK tour with the Yardbirds also inspired the band's adaptation of the song.|$|E

I’m ecstatic when people tell me <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>it,</b> but it still feels like a miracle that anyone gives the slightest shit about something I made." ...|$|R

500|$|Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is {{the first}} English {{language}} film and the first big studio production of Norwegian writer and director Wirkola, {{up to this point}} best known for his 2009 Nazi zombie-themed, independent horror comedy film Dead Snow. Wirkola said he was contacted by producer Kevin Messick from Gary Sanchez Productions after the screening of Dead Snow at the Sundance Film Festival: [...] "So my first meeting, my first day in LA was with those guys and I pitched Hansel and Gretel and <b>they</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it.</b> And they took me to Paramount two days after and we sold it." [...] In 2013, Wirkola commented, [...] "I’m still surprised that they went for it, because it’s a crazy, rock n’ roll script. It’s full throttle, there’s lots of blood and gore and bad language, I often wonder how I got this movie made. It’s all across the world now. But people really seem to respond to it, which is what we hoped, that people would enjoy this ride." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{movie was}} {{critically}} acclaimed but, in Hill's words, it [...] "didn't make a... nickel anywhere. Foreign domestic, anything... I {{was proud of}} the film... But I was disappointed in the lack of response. It was a universal audience failure... Usually you can say <b>they</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> in Japan or something. I don't think anybody loved it anywhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kelly {{sent the}} {{organizers}} of the 2006 Cannes Film Festival a rough cut of Southland Tales on DVD assuming {{that it would not be}} accepted. Much to his surprise, <b>they</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> and wanted the film entered in competition for the Palme d'Or. He stopped editing the film and was also unable to complete all of the visual effects in time for the screening. Kelly's film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2006 with a length of 160 minutes. Kelly describes the negative reaction at Cannes as a [...] "very painful experience on a lot of levels" [...] but ultimately felt that the film [...] "was better off because of it". After the film's festival release, Southland Tales was purchased by Sony Pictures.|$|E

2500|$|Manson often drew musical {{inspiration}} from his dreams, {{but the idea}} to cover this song came from his first experimentation with LSD at a house party, according to his autobiography. He says that he hallucinated a [...] "slower, meaner" [...] version of the dance hit playing, sung in his voice. He also stated that Nothing {{did not want to}} release this as a single. Daisy Berkowitz stated [...] "When the song was released it divided people – <b>they</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> or hated it. This was good. Just like us, as a band, if loved – you’re loved. If hated, people that hate you talk about you even more so". They wanted to release their cover of Screamin' Jay Hawkins' [...] "I Put a Spell on You", which, according to Manson, [...] "was far too dark, sprawling and esoteric, even for some of our fans." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Driver was {{financed by}} EMI Films who {{announced}} {{they would make}} a second film with Hill, a Western he wrote with Roger Spottiswoode, The Last Gun. However The Driver was a commercial failure in the US. [...] "To say it did not do well would be kind," [...] said Hill. [...] "Had I not been shooting The Warriors at the time, I don't think my career would have survived. <b>They</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> overseas, but in those days, that didn't matter that much. It made exactly zero dollars in the United States. I remember the studio had this huge sheaf of Xeroxed reviews they'd handed me — you could stop a fucking [...]45 slug with this stack, it was so thick. And of all the reviews in this six-inch thick pile, {{there was only one}} good one."

6000|$|Everybody was mad with {{happiness}} in the family. Home was home, and <b>they</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> {{with a passion}} of love, whatever the suffering had been.

30|$|Through {{kinship and}} {{community}} ties, {{there is a}} strong social element to transhumance.

(A communal herding system still exists in other parts of Romania.) Asked why they continue to walk with their sheep over long distances, Dan D and Dumitru S said that they do <b>it</b> because <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>it,</b> and it is in their blood.|$|R

60|$|Slowly {{the little}} craft crept {{farther and farther}} into the dim {{interior}} of the vast cavern, while its two passengers feasted {{their eyes on the}} beauties constantly revealed. Both the old seaman and the little girl loved the ocean in all its various moods. To them it was a constant companion and a genial comrade. If it stormed and raved, they laughed with glee; if it rolled great breakers against the shore, they clapped their hands joyfully; if it lay slumbering at their feet, they petted and caressed it, but always <b>they</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|These men, these boys, {{like her}} father and Jake, like Dorn and his comrades--how simple, natural, inevitable, {{elemental}} they were! They loved a fight. They might hate it, too, but <b>they</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> most. Life of men was all strife, and the greatness in them came out in war. War searched out {{the best and the}} worst in men. What were wounds, blood, mangled flesh, agony, and death to men--to those who went out for liberation of something unproven in themselves? Life was only a breath. The secret must lie in the beyond, for men could not act that way for nothing. Some hidden purpose through the ages! ...|$|E

5000|$|When Paul Eddington visited Australia {{during the}} 1980s, {{he was treated}} as a visiting British PM by the then Australian leader, Bob Hawke, who was a fan of the show. At a rally, Hawke said [...] "You don't want to be {{listening}} to me; you want to be listening to the real Prime Minister", forcing Eddington to improvise. In an interview to promote the first series of Yes, Prime Minister, Derek Fowlds said that [...] "both political sides believe that it satirises their opponents, and civil servants <b>love</b> <b>it</b> because it depicts them as being more powerful than either. And of course, <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> because it's all so authentic."

6000|$|There is {{no doubt}} that very many persons know and care as little about bird voices as this lady; but how about the others who do know and care a good deal--what do they think and feel about the song of the wood wren? I know two or three persons who are as fond of the bird as I am; and two or three recent writers on bird life have spoken of its song as if <b>they</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it.</b> The ornithologists have in most cases been {{satisfied}} to quote Gilbert White's description of Letter XIX.: [...] "This last haunts only the tops of trees in high beechen woods, and makes a sibilous grasshopper-like noise now and then, at short intervals, shaking a little with its wings when it sings." ...|$|E
60|$|The slope {{was hot and}} still, {{with only}} a {{rustling}} of leaves in the wind. The air was dry. Kurt missed the sweet fragrance of wheat. What odor there was seemed {{to be like that}} of burning weeds. The great, undulating open of the Bend extended on three sides. His parents had spent the best of their lives there and had now been taken to the bosom of the soil <b>they</b> <b>loved.</b> <b>It</b> seemed natural. Many were the last resting-places of toilers of the wheat there on those hills. And surely in the long frontier days, and in the ages before, men innumerable had gone back to the earth from which they had sprung. The dwelling-places of men were beautiful; it was only life that was sad. In this poignant, revealing hour Kurt could not resist human longings and regrets, though he gained incalculable strength from these two graves on the windy slope. It was not for any man to understand to the uttermost the meaning of life.|$|E
60|$|So the Umpondwana made {{ready to}} fight, not because <b>they</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it,</b> {{but because they}} must, for they knew that no humbleness would help them in face of the spears of Dingaan. The cattle were driven into the centre kraal, and great {{supplies}} of grass and green corn were cut to feed them. Except for one manhole the pass leading {{to the top of}} the mountain was closed, and the schanzes, or walls, which protected the mouth of the river that welled from the hillside between the eastern ridges were strengthened and garrisoned. Here, as Sihamba knew, was their weak place, for this river flowed out beneath the impregnable precipices of rock, and to it they must look for their main supply of water, since, although the spring upon the tableland, if husbanded, would suffice for a supply to the tribe, it was not sufficient for the cattle. It was for this reason that Sihamba wished to turn the kine loose and let the Zulus capture them if they would, for she knew that then they could never take the mountain or harm a hair of the head of one of its inhabitants. But the Umpondwana were greedy, and would not consent to the loss of their cattle, forgetting that cattle are of no value to dead men. They said that they could very well defend the schanzes which surrounded the source of the river, and that from it sufficient water could be carried to keep the beasts alive, even if the siege were long.|$|E
