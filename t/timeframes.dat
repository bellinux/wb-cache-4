25|$|Young Earth creationism is the {{religious}} {{belief that the}} Earth was created by God within the last 10,000 years, literally as described in Genesis, within the approximate timeframe of biblical genealogies (detailed for example in the Ussher chronology). Young Earth creationists often believe that the Universe has a similar age to the Earth's. Creationist cosmologies are attempts by some creationist thinkers to give the universe an age consistent with the Ussher chronology and other Young-Earth <b>timeframes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{development}} of modern scientific method, Catholic theology had allowed for biblical text to be read as allegorical, rather than literal, where it appeared to contradict that which could be established by science or reason. Thus Catholicism {{has been able to}} refine its understanding of scripture in light of scientific discovery. Among the early Church Fathers there was debate over whether God created the world in six days, as Clement of Alexandria taught, or in a single moment as held by Augustine, and a literal interpretation of Genesis was normally taken for granted in the Middle Ages and later, until it was rejected in favour of uniformitarianism (entailing far greater <b>timeframes)</b> by a majority of geologists in the 19th century. However modern literal creationism has had little support among the higher levels of the Church.|$|E

Yet it has managed to condense these entities to a volume of several dozen cubic metres (though much of the contents and the operating structure are continually in hyperspace). Minds also demonstrate reaction times and multitasking abilities orders of magnitude greater than any sentient being; armed engagements between Culture and equivalent technological civilizations sometimes occur in <b>timeframes</b> as short as microseconds, and standard Orbital Minds are capable of running all of the vital systems on the Orbital while simultaneously conversing with millions of the inhabitants and observing phenomena in the surrounding regions of space.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{the time}} lags {{inherent}} in the dynamic response of groundwater to development have been ignored by water management agencies, decades after scientific understanding of the issue was consolidated. In brief, the effects of groundwater overdraft (although undeniably real) may take decades or centuries to manifest themselves. In a classic study in 1982, Bredehoeft and colleagues modeled a situation where groundwater extraction in an intermontane basin withdrew the entire annual recharge, leaving ‘nothing’ for the natural groundwater-dependent vegetation community. Even when the borefield was situated close to the vegetation, 30% of the original vegetation demand could still be met by the lag {{inherent in the}} system after 100 years. By year 500, this had reduced to 0%, signalling complete death of the groundwater-dependent vegetation. The science has been available to make these calculations for decades; however, in general water management agencies have ignored effects that will appear outside the rough timeframe of political elections (3 to 5 years). Marios Sophocleous argued strongly that management agencies must define and use appropriate <b>timeframes</b> in groundwater planning. This will mean calculating groundwater withdrawal permits based on predicted effects decades, sometimes centuries in the future.|$|E
25|$|Grid Autosport {{comes in}} two {{versions}} – a standard edition {{and a special}} edition, the latter of which is called the Black Edition. It was announced on 8 May 2014 and it includes an extra vehicle (a Mercedes Benz SLS AMG Coupé Black Series), extra sponsors and extra liveries for both offline and online modes. Pre-orders for Grid Autosport by retailers began {{as soon as the}} initial game announcement was made. Steam pre-orders went online a week later than planned, on 30 May 2014, however, all of those who pre-ordered the title via Steam received the Black Edition at no extra cost compared to the standard edition. Those who owned Grid 2 received a 10% discount and a free copy of Dirt Showdown as well. Grid Autosport was officially released on 24 June 2014 in North America and 27 June 2014 in Europe across all three current-gen platforms, PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The OS X and Linux port was released on 10 December 2015 by Feral Interactive. Lead designer James Nicholls confirmed as early as the initial game announcement that the game would not make it onto next-gen platforms given the tight <b>timeframes</b> the team worked with during the development process.|$|E
25|$|The next emperor, Caracalla, {{in order}} to {{increase}} tax revenue and boost his popularity (at least to the historian Cassius Dio), extended the citizenship to all males throughout the empire, with the exception of slaves. In 213, {{on his way to the}} east to begin his Parthian campaign, Caracalla passed through Dacia. While there, he undertook diplomatic manoeuvrings to disturb the alliances between a number of tribes, in particular the Marcomanni and the Quadi. At Porolissum he had Gaiobomarus, the king of the Quadi, killed under the pretext of conducting peace negotiations. There may have been military conflict with one or more of the Danubian tribes. Although there are inscriptions that indicate that during Caracalla's visit there was some repair or reconstruction work undertaken at Porolissum and that the military unit stationed there, Cohors V Lingonum, erected an equestrian statue of the emperor, certain modern authors, such as Philip Parker and Ion Grumeza, claim that Caracalla continued to extend the Limes Transalutanus as well as add further territory to Dacia by pushing the border around 50 kilometres east of the Olt river, though it is unclear what evidence they are using to support these statements, and the <b>timeframes</b> associated with Caracalla's movements do not support any extensive reorganization in the province. In 218, Caracalla's successor, Macrinus, returned a number of non-Romanized Dacian hostages whom Caracalla had taken, possibly as a result of some unrest caused by the tribes after Caracalla's assassination.|$|E

500|$|The Kirkus Reviews {{described}} Middlesex as a [...] "virtuosic {{combination of}} elegy, sociohistorical study, and picaresque adventure", and Adam Begley in the New York Observer called it [...] "a hybrid form, epic crossed with history, romance, comedy, tragedy."

Covering {{the lives of}} three generations of the Stephanides family, Middlesex is considered a family saga by novelist Geraldine Bedell. The book {{is more than a}} mere family saga, according to Samuel Cohen in his paper for Twentieth Century Literature; it depicts the Stephanides' trials and tribulations through historical events. Cohen is not convinced by Eugenides' declaration that Middlesex was not conceived as a historical novel; he said the novel satisfied much of the criterion for the genre. Cal, narrating his story in 2002, describes events from the early 1920s to the mid-1970s.

500|$|In {{response}} to a wave of oil nationalizations and the high prices of the 1970s, industrial nations took steps to reduce their dependence on OPEC oil, especially after prices reached new peaks approaching US$40/bbl in 1979–1980 when the Iranian Revolution and Iran–Iraq War disrupted regional stability and oil supplies. Electric utilities worldwide switched from oil to coal, natural gas, or nuclear power; national governments initiated multibillion-dollar research programs to develop alternatives to oil; and commercial exploration developed major non-OPEC oilfields in Siberia, Alaska, the North Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. By 1986, daily worldwide demand for oil dropped by 5million barrels, non-OPEC production rose by an even-larger amount, and OPEC's market share sank from approximately 50 percent in 1979 to less than 30 percent in 1985. Illustrating the volatile multi-year <b>timeframes</b> of typical market cycles for natural resources, {{the result was a}} six-year decline in the price of oil, which culminated by plunging more than half in 1986 alone.

500|$|A {{subcommittee}} {{was set up}} in 1997 {{to undertake}} a review of rare bird records from the years immediately prior to BBRC's establishment. The purpose of the review was to ensure that all records from 1950 onwards (the cut-off date for Category A of the BOU British List of birds) have been subjected to a similar level of scrutiny. Not all of the 1,100 records of species considered to be rarities at that time were assessed, but only those related to species not recorded more than 100 times by 1997, as well as a few records of less rare species under particularly unusual circumstances, which were termed [...] "sore thumbs". Much of the original documentation was unavailable for the review, as it had been lost, and so for many records, the review was based solely on published accounts of the birds. The most notable outcome of this review was the reidentification of a frigatebird record from Tiree in 1953. Previously identified as a magnificent frigatebird, the BBRC review concluded that the bird was in fact an Ascension frigatebird, the only individual of this species ever identified in Europe (Walbridge, Small & McGowan 2003). The full results of the review were published in 2006. Of the 126 records reviewed, 37 were rejected as unacceptable. These included a claimed white-tailed eagle, which broke into a chicken-run in a garden and stole a chicken, three little crakes, three European scops owls, the only late December record of tawny pipit, three black-eared wheatears, a record of two White's thrushes together in April, a spring lanceolated warbler, two moustached warblers and a pine grosbeak. Furthermore, issues were found with the identification of Britain's first western sandpiper, on Fair Isle in 1956, and these led the BOURC to reject this record. The western sandpiper has been recorded several times subsequently in Britain however, and remains on the national list. The subcommittee's final report also hints at the prospect that some records from immediately prior to 1950 may be incorrect; because these fell outside the <b>timeframes</b> of the review they were not reassessed.|$|E

Understanding references to time is fundamental to comprehending the context and order of events within a narrative. This study examined the functioning of a central comprehension mechanism, suppression 1, 2, in narratives that cue a shift in <b>timeframe</b> in individuals with right hemisphere brain damage (RHD). The <b>timeframe</b> in normal narrative processing {{is assumed to be}} continuous 3 - 4. Shifts in the <b>timeframe</b> of events trigger the suppression mechanism, which reduces a comprehender’s mental activation of information that was processed before the time shift. When the <b>timeframe</b> of a narrative is disrupted (e. g., something happens “an hour later”), information that was mentally active before the time shift becomes less relevant and is suppressed. Suppression is a general comprehension mechanism that acts across language levels and domains (e,g, words, sentences, narratives, etc.) 1, 5. Based on evidence of RHD suppression deficit in lexical ambiguity processing 6 - 7, it was predicted that adults with RHD would also have difficulty suppressing information from a prior <b>timeframe</b> following a shift in narrative timeline.
