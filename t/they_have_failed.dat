5|$|Even by Sammarinese standards, {{qualification}} for the 1998 World Cup was disappointing. Losing {{every game}} by three goals or more, San Marino failed {{to score a}} single goal. This is the only World Cup qualifying tournament in which <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> to score. Qualification for Euro 2000 again resulted in defeats in every game. The closest game was against Cyprus, a 1–0 defeat on 18 November 1998.|$|E

Because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>failed,</b> Cavaldi is ordered to kill both the Grimms; but, after convincing Delatombe that the magic {{in the forest}} is {{actually}} caused by German rebels, he sends them back. While Cavaldi stays behind with Angelika in the village, the brothers attempt {{to get into the}} tower. Jake succeeds and discovers the Queen and the power of her mirror. Meanwhile, another girl, named Sasha, is captured despite Angelika and Cavaldi's efforts to save her.|$|E
5|$|A One Day International (ODI) is a cricket {{match between}} two {{representative}} teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by}} the International Cricket Council (ICC). The first ODI was played between Australia and England on January 5, 1971. The United States (U.S.) played its first ODI under the captaincy of Richard Staple at the Kennington Oval, London on September 10, 2004 against New Zealand. This match occurred during the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, which took place from September 10 to 25. The U.S. played a total of two matches during this tournament and lost both, failing to qualify for the semifinals. Since that tournament, the United States has not played any more ODIs as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> to regain their ODI status.|$|E

5|$|FreeSpace 2s {{story is}} brought out via {{narrative}} pre-rendered cutscenes, the pre- and post-mission briefings, {{as well as}} in-game chatter between non-player characters, and scripted mission events. The structure for the story is linear without any branching paths for alternate storylines, though there are optional covert missions which can further flesh out the story. The story can only be continued by clearing missions and progressing through the campaign. However, players are given the option to skip a mission if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> it five times in a row. This gives those {{who are interested in}} the story, but less skilled, the chance to continue on with the story without frustration.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Hordaland County Council {{decided that}} an {{extension}} of the Bergen Light Rail to Sotra was to be made part of the extension plans in the period until 2040. For the light rail to use existing infrastructure, a bridge would have to be chosen. The road project has been criticized by environmentalists because it uniformly bases growth in transport to the archipelago based on cars, and lacks any plans for inclusion of public transport, whether by light rail or as bus lanes. Criticism has also been raised against the Norwegian Public Roads Administration being responsible for planning the public transport, as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> to produce efficient public transport systems in Bergen.|$|E

Criticism has also focused on their rejection of blood transfusions, particularly in life-threatening medical situations, and claims that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> to report cases of sexual abuse to the authorities. Many of the claims are denied by Jehovah's Witnesses and some have also been disputed by courts and religious scholars.|$|E

50|$|The {{greatest}} service which Elder rendered {{to practical}} engineering was {{the adoption of}} the compound or combined high and low pressure engines. Various attempts at this combination had been made before, but <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed,</b> owing to causes which engineers either did not understand or could not overcome. Where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed,</b> Elder succeeded. Professor Macquorn Rankine, who has gone into all the details of the subject in his memoir of Elder, says that only one who had thoroughly studied and understood the principles of thermodynamics could have achieved this. A saving of fuel amounting to thirty or forty per cent was effected.|$|R

25|$|When {{the series}} began, all {{entrants}} took a conservative approach to {{their choice of}} chassis supplier and opted for the established Dallara F302/F303. Alternative chassis have been tested and/or raced on occasions, but {{for a variety of}} reasons, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> to become established. In the opening round of 2004, a pair of Anglo-Japanese Lola-Dome F106/03 chassis were entered by Coloni Motorsport before the team returned to the Italian F3 Championship. The two chassis builders later parted company, with Lola developing the B05/30 and Dome continuing with the F106. Dome announced its intention to promote its product to Euro Series teams in 2005, though it has not been raced in the series to date. In February 2005, AM-Holzer Rennsport announced its intention to enter a new F3 chassis from the French constructor Mygale – the 05F3. However, Holzer returned to the Dallara F305 by the start of the season.|$|E
25|$|Card users {{sometimes}} {{forget to}} touch in or touch out, {{are unable to}} find the yellow readers {{or it may be}} too crowded to touch out. Such card users have either received penalty fares by revenue inspectors, been charged a maximum cash fare, or been prosecuted in courts which can issue high penalties. Card users are also penalised for touching {{in and out of the}} same station within a two-minute period. The system applies two penalty fares (one for touching in, and one for touching out) to passengers who touch in, wait more than twenty minutes for a train, but are unable to travel because there are no trains, baulk at the waiting, and touch out. This is because the system assumes that, after such a long delay, the passenger has traveled to another station where <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> to touch out and failed to touch in, thus resulting in two penalty fares.|$|E
