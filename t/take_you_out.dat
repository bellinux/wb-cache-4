It featured a thumping dance beat with snippets of German words. The remix ended with the lyrics, [...] "I'll <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> tonight/say whatever you like." [...] On January 20, 2011, Mugler's creative director Nicola Formichetti premiered a short film featuring a remix of the song. Gaga commented on her website, Littlemonsters.com, {{that she wanted to}} release [...] "Scheiße" [...] as a single but her label did not want her to put it out. [...] "Scheiße" [...] was released as part of Gaga's second studio album, Born This Way, on May 23, 2011.|$|E
500|$|The song {{starts with}} Gaga saying, [...] "I don't speak German, but I can if you like", then {{immediately}} launches into a spoken verse in faux-German. She then {{moves to the}} hook of the song, [...] "I’ll <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> tonight, say whatever you like, scheiße be mine". Following the hook is a pre-chorus backed by syncopated synths, with influences of techno music. The chorus of the song, in which Gaga includes the word [...] "Scheiße", is backed by [...] "dueling screechy" [...] synths. It is broken up by Gaga repeatedly singing in-between lines [...] "oh oh oh oh oh" [...] in an electronically altered voice. The next verses, containing lyrics of Gaga being a strong woman, are all backed by [...] "growling, guttural" [...] synths, and are mixed with German and English. According to the sheet music published by Hal Leonard Corporation, [...] "Scheiße" [...] is written in the time signature of common time, with a tempo of 131 beats per minute. It is composed on the key of C minor, with Gaga's voice spanning from F3 to C5. The song follows in the sequence of Cm–Cm/Cm–Eb/Gm as its chord progression.|$|E
2500|$|Connolly {{revisited}} this tenement in Drumchapel during filming for the South Bank Show in 1992. [...] "It eventually {{started to}} pall. This dreadful atmosphere came about the place. It's like Siberia. And once you're out here, there's no {{getting out of}} it. You have to buy your way out, {{or some kind of}} talent has to <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>out,</b> or {{you have to be very}} bright and move away to university." [...] Also at fourteen, Connolly started to become interested in music— mainly Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry. At 15, he left school with two engineering qualifications, one collected by mistake which belonged to a boy named Connell.|$|E

2500|$|Several reviews {{mention that}} they found the AI to be, {{depending}} on discipline, too aggressive, {{so much so that}} [...] "having an AI <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> at least once a race is (…) to be expected." [...] Edge elaborated that [...] "they don’t always concede in the same way a human driver might, sticking to their chosen route even though you legitimately out-braked them into a corner." [...] Leaving out pit stops also left some of the critics puzzled. IGN said [...] "it’s a bizarre omission (…) that quietly undermines a lot of what Autosport does right", pointing out that suffering a puncture leaves the player with no option to repair the damage.|$|E
2500|$|April – The church {{published}} an extensive interview with Oaks and general authority Lance B. Wickman in April {{to clarify the}} church’s stance on homosexuality. In the interview, Wickman states that the church [...] "doesn't counsel against" [...] conversion therapy and that it [...] "may be appropriate" [...] for an individual to use clinical therapy to seek to diminish or eliminate homosexual feelings. However, Oaks states they [...] "can't endorse" [...] the [...] "aversive therapies" [...] recommended {{in the past to}} fix [...] "this affliction" [...] and they [...] "don’t accept responsibility for those abuses" [...] suffered by individuals who had experienced this now disavowed therapy method. On same-sex civil unions and domestic partnerships, Elder Oaks states that giving these couples the same government rights given to a man and woman marriage is [...] "not right" [...] and [...] "not appropriate". He added that a mixed-orientation marriage would be appropriate for a gay member who could [...] "deal with [...] feelings" [...] and [...] "put them in the background" [...] and felt a [...] "great attraction" [...] to someone of the opposite sex. They compared devout homosexual Mormons to those with physical or mental disabilities who will also not be able to marry, and adds that [...] "same-gender attraction did not exist in the pre-earth life and neither will it exist in the next life." [...] As far as family acceptance and inclusion of homosexual children they gave some example conversation lines like, [...] "don’t expect to stay overnight. Don’t expect to be a lengthy house guest. Don’t expect us to <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> and introduce you to our friends, or to deal with you in a public situation that would imply our approval of your 'partnership'." [...] He further stated [...] "the Lord’s way is to love the sinner while condemning the sin".|$|E
