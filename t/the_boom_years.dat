25|$|Robert Gould Shaw II (sometimes {{referred}} to as RGS II) (June 16, 1872 — March 29, 1930) was a wealthy landowner and socialite of the leisure class in the greater Boston area of Massachusetts.

30|$|To {{identify}} {{the effect of}} the crisis on the labour market, we look at who are the employees who moved out of employment (over a 12 -month period) during <b>boom</b> <b>years</b> and compare this situation with what happened {{at the start of the}} crisis. Overall, results are quite similar across all <b>boom</b> <b>years</b> available (2004 to 2007), in spite of inevitable year-to-year variation in the sample. But, data for 2004 does not include information on industries, and evidence suggests that employment in some industries started slowing down in 2007 although the total number of jobs kept on increasing up to Q 1 2008 (seasonally adjusted QNHS series). We therefore selected 2006 as <b>the</b> reference <b>boom</b> <b>year</b> in our analysis. This <b>year</b> is also <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> <b>year</b> with <b>the</b> lowest share of people staying in employment at the bottom of the wage distribution. Comparisons of labour market deterioration at the bottom of the wage distribution evaluated against this year are consequently useful because they represent lower bounds, relative to <b>the</b> other <b>boom</b> <b>years</b> in our sample. For comparison, results based on several combinations of <b>boom</b> <b>year</b> samples are reported in Table 7 in the Appendix.|$|R

Ahern declined to comment on the report.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century, Chile's {{commercial}} ties {{were primarily}} with Britain, {{a nation that}} had {{a major influence on}} the formation of the Chilean navy. The French influenced Chile's legal and educational systems and had a decisive impact on Chile, through the architecture of the capital in <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> <b>years</b> {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. German influence came from the organization and training of the army by Prussians.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} burdens on the government was the Canadian National Railway (CNR). The federal government had taken {{over a number of}} defunct and bankrupt railways during World War I and the 1920s. The debt the government assumed was over $2 billion, a massive sum at the time, but during <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> <b>years</b> it seemed payable. The Depression turned this debt into a crushing burden. Due to the decrease in trade, the CNR also began to lose substantial amounts of money during the Depression, and had to be further bailed out by the government.|$|E

25|$|While {{continuing}} to distribute films from other production companies, in 1969, {{the year in}} which the production company was founded, Million Film began producing films for Keitsū's theater chain. During <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> <b>years</b> of the pink film industry, in the mid- to late-1960s, dozens of small studios produced pink films. The major studios, including Toei, and especially Nikkatsu took over the sexploitation film in the early 1970s. This was a period of weeding-out of smaller independent studios, leaving only a few major pink studios. Along with Shintōhō Eiga and Ōkura Eiga (OP Eiga), Million {{was one of the few}} independent studios to survive this era.|$|E
25|$|Due to the 1973 {{spike in}} oil prices, {{the economy of}} Iran was flooded with foreign currency, which caused inflation. By 1974, the economy of Iran was {{experiencing}} double digit inflation, and despite the many large projects to modernize the country, corruption was rampant and caused large amounts of waste. By 1975 and 1976, an economic recession led to increased unemployment, especially among millions of youth who had migrated to the cities of Iran looking for construction jobs during <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> <b>years</b> of the early 1970s. By the late 1970s, {{many of these people}} opposed the Shah's regime and began to organize and join the protests against it.|$|E
25|$|During the Depression, {{not much}} money was {{available}} {{since the two}} banks had failed, but progress continued, and the town still looked prosperous because of the previous burst of new buildings during <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> <b>years.</b> The Artists and Writers Colony flourished and Delray Beach's fame as a resort town grew. This era is regarded as Delray Beach’s “golden age of architecture”; {{a period in which}} the city ranked 50th in population but 10th in building permits in Florida. Prominent architectural styles in Delray Beach from this period include Art Deco, Mediterranean Revival, Mission Revival, Monterey Colonial, Streamline Moderne, 'Key West style' cottages, and bungalows.|$|E

50|$|The Coal Valley Mining Company {{was formed}} in 1856. The men who {{incorporated}} the company were Holmes Hakes, Charles Buford, S.S. Guyer, Ben Harper and N.B. Buford. They gave the community its name. <b>The</b> <b>booming</b> <b>years</b> for coal mining in Coal Valley was from the 1850s to about {{the middle of the}} 1870s. Over the years other mining companies moved in. 1942 saw the end of coal mining in and around this community.|$|R
25|$|The ongoing {{demand for}} well-educated workers {{continued}}. Housing prices {{in urban areas}} continued to increase so that a modest home that in the 1960s cost $25,000, cost {{half a million dollars}} or more in urban areas by 2005. More people commuted longer hours to afford a home in more rural areas while earning larger salaries in the urban areas. Speculators bought houses they never intended to live in, expecting to make a huge profit in a matter of months, then rolling it over by buying more properties. Mortgage companies were compliant, as everyone assumed the prices would keep rising. The bubble burst in 2007-8 as housing prices began to crash and <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> <b>years</b> ended. Hundreds of billions in property values vanished and foreclosures soared as many financial institutions and investors were badly hurt.|$|E
25|$|Nationally, {{chapters}} of all fraternities existing {{at the start}} of the new century were wooed into increasingly expansive building projects in <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> <b>years</b> leading up to the Great Depression. The economic downturn became the great leveler; chapters who had extended themselves beyond their means were felled by sharply reduced revenues and growing debt. Within Phi Sig, closely tied as it was to its graduates, alumni were called in to support weakened balance sheets on buildings the undergraduate population alone could no longer afford. In one famous but probably not unique case, chapter advisor Sam Gale went door to door in 1931, successfully seeking alumni backing against the mortgage of Minnesota's newly built Tudor masterpiece. Not only was this impulse acted on at the alumni level: The Fraternity's undergraduate delegates, moved by the plight of their brethren, had fathered a plan at the 1930 Convention that channeled 25 cents each month from each active member (about $10 per month, per man, in 2013 dollars) into a fund to assist chapters stricken by the Depression; the principal of mutual helpfulness could not have been better illustrated. Low manpower, too, had brought about fraternal belt-tightening where possible, while still investing in tactical, significant national services - training in rushing techniques, a pledge manual, better accounting systems and visits by field representatives.|$|E

50|$|The Amoskeag Company is an American {{holding and}} {{operating}} company. It is {{the successor to}} the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company (AMC) of New Hampshire, and was the last owner of the Fieldcrest Mills in North Carolina. When the profits of AMC started going down in the mid-1920s, the new Amoskeag company was created, {{and all of the}} profits from <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> <b>years</b> were transferred into it so that in 1936, when AMC declared bankruptcy, that money would be untouchable. This allowed Amoskeag to continue.|$|R
500|$|By 1907, about 4,000people {{lived in}} Rhyolite, {{according}} to Richard E. Lingenfelter in Death Valley & the Amargosa: A Land of Illusion. Russell R. Elliott cites an estimated population of 5,000 in 1907–08 in Nevada's Twentieth-Century Mining Boom, noting that [...] "accurate population figures {{during the boom}} are impossible to obtain". Alan H. Patera in Rhyolite: <b>The</b> <b>Boom</b> <b>Years</b> states published estimates of the peak population have been [...] "as high as 6,000 or 8,000, but the town itself never claimed more than 3,500 through its newspapers". The newspapers estimated that 6,000people lived in the Bullfrog mining district, which included the towns of Rhyolite, Bullfrog, Gold Center, and Beatty as well as camps at the major mines.|$|E
500|$|Dawson City {{declined}} {{after the}} gold rush. When journalist Laura Berton (future mother of Pierre Berton) moved to Dawson in 1907 {{it was still}} thriving, but away from Front Street, the town had become increasingly deserted, jammed, as she put it, [...] "with the refuse of the gold rush: stoves, furniture, gold-pans, sets of dishes, double-belled seltzer bottles... piles of rusting mining machinery—boilers, winches, wheelbarrows and pumps". By 1912, only around 2,000 inhabitants remained compared to the 30,000 of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> <b>years</b> and the site was becoming a ghost town. By 1972, 500 people were living in Dawson whereas the nearby settlements created during the gold rush had been entirely abandoned. The population has grown since the 1970s, with 1,300 recorded in 2006.|$|E

In the NME, Tony Tyler derided Harrison for [...] "lay the entire Krishna-the-Goat trip on us", while Michael Watts of Melody Maker suggested that [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] {{might have been a}} better choice for the album's lead single. Writing in their 1975 book , Tyler and Roy Carr said that [...] "Give Me Love" [...] bore [...] "more than a distant resemblance" [...] to Dylan's [...] "I Want You", but praised the track for its [...] "excellent and highly idiosyncratic slide-guitar playing".|$|E

2500|$|Spain, as {{in other}} {{southern}} European nations, relies heavily on the inter-generational family structure for {{a significant portion of}} the social safety net. Employment expectations should be adjusted for this cultural ethos. The unemployment rate for the [...] "principal breadwinner" [...] is 12.4% less than the 25% overall rate (June 2012.)
