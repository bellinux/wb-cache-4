The process of envelopment within these inclusions differed in some respects from the process previously described for the envelopment of nucleocapsids at the plasma membrane of vertebrae cells.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{acoustic}} {{characteristics of the}} double elliptical vault, which overlooks the Grand Staircase of the Royal Palace of Caserta (Italy). The Royal Palace was built by the architect Luigi Vanvitelli in the Seventeenth Century {{and it is the}} largest royal building in Italy. The double elliptical vault presents a great scenography effect. Inside the vault, on the planking level, musicians used to play for the king and his guests when the royal procession, going up the grand staircase, entered the royal apartments, creating astonishment among the guests who heard the music without understanding from where it was coming. Since the musicians were inside the vault, the long reverberation made the listeners perceive the vault <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enveloped</b> by the music. To investigate this effect, the acoustic characteristics of the double vault were measured, putting the sound source on the planking level of the vault, while the microphones were put along the staircase and in the vestibule towards the royal apartments.

40|$|Abstract Background We have {{previously}} described an alternative invasion-independent pathway of cancer metastasis in a murine mammary tumor model. This pathway is initiated by intravasation of tumor nests enveloped by endothelial cells of sinusoidal vasculature within the tumor. In this study, we examined whether {{evidence for the}} invasion-independent pathway of metastasis is present in human cancers. Methods Archival specimens of 10 common types of human cancers were examined {{for the presence of}} sinusoidal vasculature enveloping tumor nests and subsequently generated endothelial-covered tumor emboli in efferent veins. Results A percentage of tumor emboli in all cancers <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enveloped</b> by endothelial cells, but these structures were particularly prevalent in renal cell carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas and follicular thyroid carcinomas. A common feature of the vasculature in these tumors was the presence of dilated sinusoid-like structures surrounding tumor nests. A high mean vascular area within tumors, an indication of sinusoidal vascular development, <b>was</b> significantly related <b>to</b> the presence of endothelial-covered tumor emboli. Conclusions These results suggest that an invasion-independent metastatic pathway is possible {{in a wide variety of}} human cancers.
