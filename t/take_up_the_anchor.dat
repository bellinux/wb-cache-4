60|$|But {{bad news}} came. The commandant of the Piraeus came in his boat, {{and said we}} must either depart or else get outside the harbor and remain imprisoned in our ship, under rigid quarantine, for eleven days! So we <b>took</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> and moved outside, to lie a dozen hours or so, taking in supplies, and then sail for Constantinople. It was the bitterest {{disappointment}} we had yet experienced. To lie a whole day in sight of the Acropolis, and yet be obliged to go away without visiting Athens! Disappointment was hardly a strong enough word to describe the circumstances.|$|R

60|$|To haul <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> {{would have}} been slow work. Slag--economical by nature--became extravagant for once. An axe made short work of cable and anchor.|$|R
60|$|The topmast was lowered, small jib and {{foresail}} got up, and two reefs {{put in the}} mainsail; {{then they}} began to get <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor.</b>|$|R

60|$|Half an {{hour after}} the Dutch Governor had left, orders were given to get <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> and loosen <b>the</b> sails, and the brig was shortly on her way north.|$|R
60|$|The {{windlass}} {{is simply}} a horizontal, instead of a perpendicular capstan. Its sole purpose is for heaving <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor,</b> and it is placed close to {{the bow of the}} ship.|$|R

60|$|At {{this point}} Karlsefin {{and the rest}} of the party came back to the shore and put an end to the conversation. Returning on board they drew <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor,</b> hoisted sail, and again put out to sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "We may as {{well get}} as near the {{entrance}} as we can before the fight begins," [...] the captain said. [...] "Get <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor,</b> {{and as soon as}} it is aboard, get out four oars on each side." ...|$|R

40|$|When a ship leaves <b>the</b> wharf heaving <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor,</b> {{it is very}} {{important}} for captain to estimate the tracks of bow and stern. Using Nansei Maru and Keiten Maru, I measured the tracks of bow and stern and got the following results: 1. The track of bow has no relation with the speed of heaving <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor.</b> 2. <b>The</b> ratio of the maximum length of swinging out of stern to ship’s length over all (K_{max}/L_{OA}) is proportional to the cable direction (θ) and its ratio is calculated by the following expression; Nansei Maru K_{max}/L_{OA}= 0. 00275 θ- 0. 0103. Keiten Maru K_{max}/L_{OA}= 0. 00271 θ- 0. 0182. 3. In case that the swinging out of stern is greatest, the turning angle of the ship (α) is as follows; Nansei Maruα= 0. 5554 θ- 0. 349. Keiten Maru α= 0. 5573 θ- 0. 418. and in practice we can get the turning angle by the following expression, α= 5 / 9 θ. 4. In case that the cable direction is 63 °~ 73 °, the trace of the bow is at the right angle with the bow and aft midship line in the early stage of heaving <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor.</b> ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Strike {{the tent}} there!"--was the next order. As I hinted before, this {{whalebone}} marquee was never pitched except in port; and {{on board the}} Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known {{to be the next}} thing to heaving <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor.</b>|$|R

60|$|And {{the master}} of the galley laughed, and, {{reaching}} out, he took the pearl, and when he saw it he pressed it to his forehead and bowed. 'It shall be,' he said, 'for the sceptre of the young King,' and he made a sign to the negroes to draw <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor.</b>|$|R

"This same {{quartermaster}} {{was celebrated}} among the English in Mesopotamia for an entry {{which he made}} in his log-book-after a perilous storm; 'The windy and watery elements raged.

6000|$|As I {{leaned over}} to heave <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor,</b> I saw <b>the</b> {{bonefish}} flashing nearer.

60|$|As {{soon as she}} {{had cleared}} the Irish coast a sullen gray-headed old wave of the Atlantic climbed leisurely over her {{straight}} bows, {{and sat down on}} her steam-capstan used for hauling <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor.</b> Now <b>the</b> capstan and the engine that drove it had been newly painted red and green; besides which, nobody likes being ducked.|$|R
