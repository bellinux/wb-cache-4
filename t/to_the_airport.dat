5|$|The initial {{plan was}} to {{evacuate}} via Mogadishu International Airport.

It also became apparent that the rebels had an ineffective command-and-control structure, making it impossible to negotiate any ceasefire or guarantee of safe passage. Likewise, government troops faced a command-and-control problem; reports indicated that army units were separating along clan lines, in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different clan when given orders they disagreed with. Thus, it became clear that safe passage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> would not be possible. Several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach Mogadishu, but faced the same problems of landing and transit of evacuees <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport.</b>|$|E
