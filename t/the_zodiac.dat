5|$|Designed by Burges for himself, <b>the</b> <b>Zodiac</b> settle was {{originally}} placed in his rooms at 15 Buckingham Street on The Strand in London, and later moved to The Tower House in Holland Park around 1878, when Burges first occupied the house. The Tower House {{was designed by}} Burges by himself. Burges continued to work on Tower House {{until his death in}} 1881, and <b>the</b> <b>Zodiac</b> settle was placed opposite the drawing room windows in Tower House. The decoration of the drawing room remained unfinished upon Burges's death. The Tower House was subsequently owned by Burges's brother-in-law, Pullan, and then by Colonel T.H. Minshall in the 1920s.

5|$|Within Final Fantasy Tactics, legends {{revolve around}} <b>the</b> <b>Zodiac</b> Brave Story, {{which deals with}} twelve knights who used the power of Zodiac Stones—magical stones {{engraved}} with symbols of the twelve Zodiac constellations—to fight against a demon summoned by an ambitious king to control Ivalice. This myth was twisted by the Glabados Church, as explained in the game's backstory, by including St. Ajora {{as the leader of}} <b>the</b> <b>Zodiac</b> Braves.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} myth of {{more recent}} origin {{is that of}} the Glastonbury Zodiac, a purported astrological zodiac of gargantuan proportions said to have been carved into the land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing Aquarius. The theory was first put forward in 1927 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist with an interest in the occult, who thought <b>the</b> <b>zodiac</b> was constructed approximately 5,000 years ago. But {{the vast majority of the}} land said by Maltwood to be covered by <b>the</b> <b>zodiac</b> was under several feet of water at the proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle {{believed}} that comets were atmospheric phenomena, {{due to the}} fact that they could appear outside of <b>the</b> <b>Zodiac</b> and vary in brightness over the course of a few days. Pliny the Elder {{believed that}} comets were connected with political unrest and death.|$|E
5|$|Around the planisphere {{moves the}} rete, a {{web-like}} metal cutout representing <b>the</b> <b>zodiac,</b> which {{also features a}} Julian calendar dial. Above the rete, a display indicates {{the day of the}} week. Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February. A moon dial circles the inner ring of <b>the</b> <b>zodiac,</b> displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the retes calendar dial. The larger one circles <b>the</b> <b>zodiac</b> at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.|$|E

5|$|Western astrology {{is founded}} on the {{movements}} and relative positions of celestial bodies such as the Sun, Moon and planets, which are analysed by their movement through signs of <b>the</b> <b>zodiac</b> (twelve spatial divisions of the ecliptic) and by their aspects (based on geometric angles) relative to one another. They are also considered by their placement in houses (twelve spatial divisions of the sky). Astrology's modern representation in western popular media is usually reduced to sun sign astrology, which considers only <b>the</b> <b>zodiac</b> sign of the Sun at an individual's date of birth, and represents only 1/12 of the total chart.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, Detectives Toschi, Armstrong, and Mulanax {{question}} Arthur Leigh Allen, {{a suspect}} in the Vallejo case. Allen behaves suspiciously during the interview. They ask to see his watch and notice that he wears a Zodiac brand wristwatch which has the same logo used by the killer. However, a handwriting expert insists that Allen did not write <b>the</b> <b>Zodiac</b> letters, even though Allen is said to be ambidextrous. Avery receives a letter threatening his life; becoming increasingly paranoid, he turns to drugs and alcohol. At one point, he shares information with the Riverside Police Department, angering both Toschi and Armstrong. The case's notoriety weighs on Toschi, who is bothered when Graysmith shows up at the theater where Toschi is watching a Hollywood film, Dirty Harry, loosely based on <b>the</b> <b>Zodiac</b> case, with his wife.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Avery {{leaves the}} Chronicle, {{and moves to}} the Sacramento Bee. Graysmith {{persistently}} contacts Toschi about <b>the</b> <b>Zodiac</b> murders, and eventually impresses the veteran detective with his knowledge of the case. While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access to the evidence, he provides contact names of other police departments in other counties where Zodiac murders occurred. Armstrong transfers from the San Francisco Police homicide division, and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a Zodiac letter. Graysmith continues his own investigation, which is profiled in the Chronicle, and he allows himself to be interviewed on television about his book-in-progress concerning the case. He begins receiving anonymous phone calls with heavy breathing. Because of his immersion in the case, Graysmith loses his job and his wife Melanie leaves him, taking their children with her. Graysmith acquires more information that points to Allen as <b>the</b> <b>Zodiac,</b> and although circumstantial evidence seems to indicate his guilt, the physical evidence, such as fingerprints and handwriting samples, do not implicate him.|$|E
