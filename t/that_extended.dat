Both vessels had two pole masts fitted with spotting tops. Nautilus and Albatross had different bows; Nautilus received a clipper bow, while Albatross had a ram bow like contemporary German light cruisers. Albatross also had a higher forecastle <b>that</b> <b>extended</b> {{to the base of the}} main mast, while Nautilus was completed with a superstructure deck that began just aft of the fore mast.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of their 1969 debut, the Allman Brothers Band toured the United States {{extensively}} to promote the album, which had little commercial success. Their performances, however, did create positive word of mouth exposure <b>that</b> <b>extended</b> to more famous musicians, such as Eric Clapton, who invited group leader Duane Allman to contribute to his 1970 album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs.|$|E
5|$|NY54 was a {{circuitous}} east–west route <b>that</b> <b>extended</b> from Utica, Oneida County, to Fonda, Montgomery County, via Speculator and Benson. It entered Hamilton County from Herkimer County {{on modern}} NY8 and proceeded east through Speculator to Wells, where it turned south to follow {{what is now}} NY30 to the Fulton County line. It was assigned in the mid-1920s and split into several routes, including NY8 and NY30, in the 1930 renumbering.|$|E

Once, when {{the building was}} closed for a state holiday, she gathered the class on the steps outside, led them through the woods, and lectured at a local coffee house. Later, after she had been dismissed by the Third Reich, she invited students into her home to discuss their {{plans for the future}} and mathematical concepts.|$|E
5|$|Poison {{was given}} a {{secondary}} outfit for Capcom Fighting All-Stars alongside her primary classic attire. Made of shiny, silvery material it consisted of boots <b>that</b> <b>extended</b> halfway up her thighs and a combined sleeveless shirt/short skirt with a plunging neckline. Gloves and a small hairband were also added, {{as well as a}} belt, with the handcuffs hanging off of it. Her arm straps were removed, though the strap around her neck remained.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat's {{absence of}} major {{conformation}} flaws was important, as horses with well made limbs and feet {{are less likely}} to become injured. Secretariat's hindquarters were the main source of his power, with a sloped croup <b>that</b> <b>extended</b> the length of his femur. When in full stride, his hind legs were able to reach far under himself, increasing his drive. His ample girth, long back and well-made neck all contributed to his heart-lung efficiency.|$|E

5|$|The Pipil used wooden weapons {{with stone}} blades. Their weapons {{included}} long spears, atlatls (spear-throwers), arrows, and the macana (a wooden sword with inset obsidian blades {{similar to the}} Aztec macahuitl). These weapons proved inferior to elements of Spanish warfare such as steel, the horse and firearms. The Spanish described how the natives of El Salvador wore thick cotton armour, described as three fingers thick, <b>that</b> <b>extended</b> down {{to their feet and}} significantly encumbered them.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{were moved}} {{on a system}} of wheeled trolleys running on Décauville rails <b>that</b> <b>extended</b> throughout each half-hangar to the quarterdeck {{at the rear of}} the ship.

The National Road was the first federally funded road built in the United States, authorized by Congress in 1806. Construction lasted from 1811 to 1837, establishing a road <b>that</b> <b>extended</b> from Cumberland to Vandalia, Illinois. Upon the establishment of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, {{the route of the}} National Road became part of US40.|$|E
5|$|After de l'Orme died in 1570, Catherine {{abandoned}} his {{design for a}} freestanding house with courtyards. To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion <b>that</b> <b>extended</b> the building towards the river. This was built in a less experimental style by Jean Bullant. Bullant attached columns to his pavilion, as advocated in his 1564 book on the classical orders, to mark proportion. Some commentators have interpreted his different approach as a criticism of de l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.|$|E

5|$|After {{landfall}} {{the storm}} rapidly weakened, and about eight hours after moving ashore, Ernesto deteriorated to tropical depression status. Interacting with a pre-existing frontal zone <b>that</b> <b>extended</b> eastward through Virginia, Ernesto quickly lost its tropical characteristics, and late on September 1 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. It re-intensified to a gale over the Mid-Atlantic states, only to weaken to an extratropical depression near Pennsylvania. With a large {{high pressure area}} to its east, the remnants turned to the north-northwest, reaching southern Ontario on September 3. After turning northeastward, the extratropical remnants of Ernesto were absorbed into a larger storm over Quebec on September 4.|$|E
5|$|All of Midler Avenue, {{including}} {{the portion of}} the street not currently part of NY598 in DeWitt, was originally designated as NY433 in the early 1950s. At the time, NY433 ended at the junction of Midler Avenue and Court Street Road (then NY298). By 1954, New Court Avenue, an east–west connector between NY298 and NY433 in DeWitt, was designated as NY436. In the late 1950s, construction began on a bypass of Court Street <b>that</b> <b>extended</b> from the western terminus of NY436 in Salina to the junction of NY298 and Thompson Road (modern NY635) in DeWitt. The bypass was opened to traffic as a realignment of NY298 by 1961. NY433 was then extended northeastward along NY298's former routing on Court Street to Carrier Circle, where it met the realigned NY298.|$|E
5|$|As the Allied {{offensive}} gained steam, Whitehead's {{main task}} was to shift his aircraft forward, advancing the bomb line incrementally towards Japan. When the P-38 Lightning arrived in the theater in late 1942, Whitehead at last received a fighter that could match the Japanese A6M Zero. To speed up the Allied advance, the Fifth Air Force developed a number of technical and tactical innovations <b>that</b> <b>extended</b> the range of its aircraft, thus increasing the distance of each Allied advance, which was dependent on the range of Whitehead's aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Before their {{defeat in}} 1697 the Itza {{controlled}} or influenced much of Petén {{and parts of}} Belize. The Itza were warlike, and their capital was Nojpetén, an island city upon Lake Petén Itzá. The Kowoj were the second in importance; they were hostile towards their Itza neighbours. The Kowoj were located around the eastern Petén lakes. The Yalain occupied a territory <b>that</b> <b>extended</b> eastwards to Tipuj in Belize. Other groups in Petén are less well known, and their precise territorial extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the Chinamita, the Icaiche, the Kejache, the Lakandon Ch'ol, the Manche Ch'ol, and the Mopan.|$|E
5|$|Carbon dating on ash mounds {{associated}} with Neolithic cultures in South India {{date back to}} 8000BCE. Artefacts such as ground stone axes, and minor copper objects {{have been found in}} the region. Towards the beginning of 1000BCE, iron technology spread through the region; however, there {{does not appear to be}} a fully developed Bronze Age preceding the Iron Age in South India. The region was in the middle of a trade route <b>that</b> <b>extended</b> from Muziris to Arikamedu linking the Mediterranean and East Asia. Trade with Phoenicians, Romans, Greeks, Arabs, Syrians, Jews and Chinese began from the Sangam period (c. 3rd century BC to c. 4th century AD). The region was part of the ancient Silk Road connecting the Asian continent in the East and the West.|$|E
5|$|Deep {{convection}} reformed the storm's center {{southwest of}} Haiti, near Jamaica's east coast. Under {{the influence of}} a mid-level ridge <b>that</b> <b>extended</b> from the Gulf of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean, Gustav picked up a westward motion. It was briefly disrupted by Jamaica as it passed over the mountainous island but rapidly strengthened when it moved over open water once again. Reaching Category4 strength less than 24 hours after having been a tropical storm, Gustav brushed the Isle of Youth and made landfall on Cuba's western's peninsula.|$|E
