5|$|A sequel, Wii Sports Resort, {{was first}} {{revealed}} at Nintendo's E3 2008 presentation. Development moved forward after {{the extent of}} the Wii MotionPlus was realized, though <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sequel existed sooner. The game was released in Japan on June 25, 2009 before releasing in other markets in July 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Richard Garfield {{approached}} Wizards of the Coast with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{new board}} game called RoboRally, but {{was turned down}} because the game {{would have been too}} expensive for Wizards of the Coast to produce. Instead, Adkison asked Garfield if he could invent a game that was both portable and quick-playing, to which Garfield agreed.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, Nomura {{expressed}} {{desire to}} release a high definition re-release of the game though {{he had yet to}} confirm such plans. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> high definition re-release preceded plans for Final Fantasy X re-release, and was a focus for two Square Enix programmers for over a year.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> tunnel under Loveland Pass {{existed at}} least since the 1940s. Serious {{discussion}} began when the state of Colorado lobbied for the Interstate Highway System to route a transcontinental highway across Colorado. After a round of negotiations with Utah officials, it was decided the best option was to follow the U.S. Route 6 corridor. Engineers recommended to tunnel under the pass, rather than attempt to build a route across it that conformed to Interstate Highway standards.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{video game}} centred on asylum seekers in Australia came to Katharine Neil, then an {{developer}} at Atari's Melbourne studio, {{in the aftermath}} of the 2001 Tampa affair. Neil spent a year and a half assembling a team to work on the game and securing initial funding for the project. Fourteen people contributed to the game, with a core development team of four. Many of the Australian members of the development team, including Neil, contributed to the project anonymously to protect their jobs.|$|E
5|$|Commander Keen is {{the final}} game in the series, {{released}} on May 30, 2001 for the Game Boy Color. Developed by David A. Palmer Productions and published by Activision, it was created as both a sequel and homage to the series as a whole, and {{does not have an}} episode number. Id was not a major partner in development, though it retained editorial control over the game, and Adrian Carmack contributed some artwork. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Game Boy Color Keen game came from John Carmack and id, who approached Activision, which in turn proposed Palmer as the developer.|$|E

5|$|For centuries, road users {{wishing to}} go from Saltash to Plymouth had two main choices. Travel by coach {{involved}} a long detour north either to Gunnislake New Bridge (a one-lane bridge constructed in 1520), or other bridges further north along the Devon – Cornwall border. The alternative was to catch a ferry across the Tamar. The Torpoint Ferry had been running successfully since 1791 (and is still in active service) while the Saltash Ferry ran near to the bridge's present location. While popular, the ferries did not have sufficient capacity by the 20th century to cater for motor traffic. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fixed crossing across the Tamar had been floated around since the early 19th century, and proposals had been discussed in Parliament as early as 1930.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Tina Fey, {{then head}} writer of Saturday Night Live (SNL), pitched <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> series about a {{cable news network}} to NBC, who {{rejected}} it. Two years later, Fey approached NBC with a similar idea: a behind-the-scenes look at The Girlie Show, a television show similar to SNL. NBC approved the series in May 2006 and production began shortly after. Although the episode received generally positive reviews, it finished third in its timeslot among all viewers and among adults aged 18 to 49. Critics praised the performances of Jack McBrayer and Jane Krakowski, who played Kenneth Parcell and Jenna Maroney, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Love Productions {{approached}} the BBC with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> programme that would feature a prominent {{member of the}} business community working with unemployed people, but the show did not come to fruition after the unnamed individual had to withdraw from it because of other commitments. The format for the series that would later become Benefits Street was then suggested, but the BBC declined to commission the series because it was producing a number of other programmes concerning similar issues, such as People Like Us and Nick and Margaret: We All Pay Your Benefits. Love Productions then suggested the format to Channel 4, who agreed to commission the programme.|$|E

50|$|The IAO was {{established}} after Admiral John Poindexter, former United States National Security Advisor to President Ronald Reagan, and SAIC executive Brian Hicks approached the US Department of Defense with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> information awareness program {{after the attacks}} of September 11, 2001.|$|R
5|$|Mells' war {{dead were}} first commemorated by a stone tablet {{on a wall}} in St Andrew's Church, {{designed}} by the Kensington School of Art and listing the names of 14 villagers. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> larger, public memorial originated with the Horner family, who called a public meeting to discuss the possibilities. The participants first considered whether the memorial should be something with a utilitarian function or something purely monumental. Suggestions for utilitarian memorials included benches, a fountain, a garden, and a children's playground, but they felt that the memorial should be something {{to be looked at}} and admired. After discussing various potential locations, including St Andrew's churchyard, they decided that the memorial should be on the road in a prominent position where it would be obvious to passers-by.|$|E
5|$|THX 1138 was {{released}} in March 1971 and Lucas was offered opportunities to direct Lady Ice (1973), Tommy (1975) or Hair (1979). He turned down those offers, determined to pursue his own projects despite his urgent desire to find another film to direct. During this time, Lucas conceived <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> space opera (as yet untitled) which later {{became the basis for}} his Star Wars franchise. At the May 1971 Cannes Film Festival, THX was chosen for the Directors' Fortnight competition. There, Lucas met David Picker, then president of United Artists, who was intrigued by American Graffiti and Lucas's space opera. Picker decided to give Lucas $10,000 to develop Graffiti as a screenplay.|$|E
5|$|The ACC Championship Game {{traditionally}} {{matches the}} winner of the Coastal and Atlantic Divisions of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Prior to 2005, no championship game existed. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> championship game originated with the league's 2004expansion, which added former Big East members Miami, Virginia Tech, and (in 2005) Boston College. A request to the National Collegiate Athletic Association by conference officials to hold a championship game following the 2004 season was rejected because the ACC lacked the requisite 12teams, and so the league's first championship game had to wait until after Boston College's addition, which had been delayed at the school's request. With the addition of Boston College, the ACC consisted of 12 teams, allowing it to hold a conference championship game under NCAA rules. Before the start of the 2005 season, both Virginia Tech and Florida State were picked as pre-season favorites to play in the championship game in an annual poll conducted by members of the media who cover the ACC.|$|E
50|$|The Pennsylvania Keystoners was <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> American {{football}} team thought up by then-Pittsburgh Pirates owner, Art Rooney, in 1939 {{to have a}} single National Football League franchise based in both Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The team would play half of its home games in each location.|$|R
50|$|In the Martian Manhunter series, the Guardians {{first get}} <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> intergalactic police force from the Martians' own Manhunters.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> indoor {{attraction}} like Granby Manor predates all MLA Industries and Entertainments attractions. Early concept {{art from}} 2012 shows floor plans and sets {{similar to those}} of Granby Manor and Forbidden. However, the project was scrapped because of permitting issues and lack of funding.|$|R
5|$|The first {{continental}} competition organised by CONMEBOL, {{the governing}} body of football in South America, was the 1960 Copa Libertadores. Before this official tournament, Chilean club Colo-Colo's President Robinson Alvarez had <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> South American Championship of Champions, which was eventually held in Santiago in 1948. In 1958, the new CONMEBOL president, José Ramos de Freitas, contacted South American football associations intending to introduce an annual competition for clubs on the continent. The following year, at a CONMEBOL congress in Caracas, {{the creation of}} a South American Champions Cup was decided, renamed as Copa Libertadores in honour of the heroes of South American liberation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Linguistic Institute {{was first}} {{proposed}} {{in the spring of}} 1927 by Reinhold Saleski. The fledgling Society was hesitant at first, but Edgar Sturtevant was keen on the idea. Sturtevant molded Saleski's idea into a model still used today: a gathering of scholars in conjunction with coursework. The Executive Committee voted to authorize the first Linguistic Institute, to be held 1928, along with authorization for a second institute in 1929. After the fourth Institute in 1931, the program took a four-year hiatus due to the great depression. Institutes were held every year concurrently with summer meetings of the LSA until 1988 when, due to increasing costs, the Society announced that the Linguistic Institutes would be held every other year. It was at that same time that the summer meeting of the LSA was also discontinued.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{remake of}} Hawaii Five-O first came about in 1996, when CBS {{commissioned}} a sequel starring Gary Busey and Russell Wong, {{along with a}} cameo appearance by James MacArthur, who portrayed the original Danny Williams, as Danny who was promoted to the state governor. Though the pilot was produced, it was never released. Twelve years later, on August 12, 2008, CBS commissioned another sequel to Five-O, with Criminal Minds executive producer Edward Allen Bernero appointed to write the pilot. The sequel would center on Steve McGarrett's son. However the sequel was never produced.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{electronically}} controlled {{four-wheel drive}} system emerged at BorgWarner in 1985. BorgWarner’s original design called <b>for</b> using both <b>a</b> software controlled electromagnetic multi-disc (also called multi-plate) clutch pack and a planetary or bevel geared center differential together. The first prototype system was crude, and its original clutch pack controller was a rheostat.|$|R
5|$|The {{third and}} current DeKalb County Courthouse was {{constructed}} in 1905 at an approximate cost of $137,000. The project reignited {{the debate over the}} county courthouse's location and, once again, the debate over which town would hold the coveted title of county seat. The county Board of Supervisors authorized the project in 1901 and appropriated $100,000 for the new building. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new courthouse originated as early as 1900, when the essential design elements of the Lee County courthouse were chosen as the model for the new DeKalb County Courthouse. Though the courthouse was modeled after the Lee County structure it does differ; the Lee County building, in Dixon, Illinois, has a rooftop dome and also is longer and wider than the DeKalb County building. By 1903, the appropriation had been upped to $140,000 and the battle over the county seat had begun.|$|E
5|$|According to game creator Steven Howse, he was {{inspired}} to create the game while he was experiencing financial problems. As {{a result of these}} financial issues, he had to move from Minneapolis to Michigan, where he realized the popularity of Agar.io. He had long wanted to create an online multiplayer game, but the only option for the development at the time was in Adobe Flash, and not wanting to use this method, he gave up <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while. Howse finally created the game when he realized that WebSocket, a low-latency protocol supported by most major browsers, was sufficient and stable enough to run an HTML game similar to other games such as Agar.io. The most difficult part of the development was in making each server stable enough to handle 600 players at a time. Howse struggled to find space on servers with enough space in regions where there was more demand and tried to avoid cloud services like Amazon Web Services, owing to the high cost that these services would incur based on the amount of bandwidth used.|$|E
5|$|Each summer (June, July, and August in the US), the {{producers}} would outline the storylines for the subsequent season. Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign. Unlike other storylines, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> relationship between Joey and Rachel was decided on {{halfway through the}} eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey's romantic interest in Rachel. The storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season's finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure {{about the amount of}} storyline to give to Rachel's baby, as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none. Crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they decided to do because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season. Kauffman and Crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even if all the cast members had wanted to continue.|$|E
