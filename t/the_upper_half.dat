Manuela Berchtold, the only female Australian representative in 2006, came 14th out of 30 competitors. In 2010, Begg-Smith won silver, while two other moguls racers, one male and one female, were outside the top half and did not pass the first round.|$|E
5|$|FITs {{were first}} {{formed in the}} early 1990s, {{as part of the}} Public Order Intelligence Unit (CO11), a section of the Public Order Branch of the Metropolitan Police. They {{initially}} targeted football fans, hunt saboteurs and political protesters (since at least 1996), using cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public. The police officers wear full uniform, and are intended to be a highly visible presence. Their uniform is sometimes different from normal police officers in that <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> of their yellow fluorescent jackets is blue. Civilian photographers are also employed by the police to work alongside FITs. According to Scotland Yard, the aim of FIT teams at protests is to record evidence of protesters in case disorder occurs later on at a protest.|$|E

The Council was made up of twelve appointees who were selected by the Governor of Virginia and was <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> of the Virginia General Assembly. The lower half was made up of the House of Burgesses. This position also gave Lee the rank of Colonel, a military rank that was second only to the governor. Members of the Council were advisers to the governor and judges in the General Court of the colony. Their work led them to spend about a third of the year in the capital Williamsburg.|$|E

They were formed into four rifle companies, designated A to D and corresponding to the Auckland, Hauraki/Bay of Plenty/Rotorua, Northland and Waikato districts.

5|$|Watford's weak {{financial}} position was exposed in 2002–03, following {{the collapse of}} ITV Digital. The club was facing administration, but an agreement by players and staff to a 12% wage deferral helped the club's cash flow, and a run to the FA Cup semi-final generated vital revenue. Financial constraints saw {{a large number of}} players released that summer. After consolidating in 2003–04, the following season started well, with the club in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> of the Championship at the end of September. Poor form, however, saw the club drop towards the relegation zone. Despite reaching the semi-final of the League Cup, Watford's league form did not improve, and Lewington was sacked in March 2005.

5|$|Between Tests, Bradman rested himself {{during the}} match against Northamptonshire, which started {{the day after}} the Test, as Hassett led Australia to victory by an innings. He {{returned}} for the match against Yorkshire. Bradman came in at 1/0 when Barnes fell for a duck and top-scored with 54 as Australia made 249. Bradman pulled many short balls and reached 50 in 76 minutes. After the hosts replied with 209, Bradman came in at 1/17 and put on 154 for the second wicket with Brown, ending with 86 as the match petered into a draw. His innings ended when Hutton caught him in the leg trap. Not wanting to tire his bowlers before the Second Test that started the day after next, Bradman showed little intent to win the match. The batsmen batted unhurriedly and set Yorkshire 329 for victory with only 70 minutes of play remaining and the hosts ended at 4/85. Yardley expressed his displeasure by allowing his part-timers to bowl and then promoting tail-enders to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> of the batting order in the second innings.

5|$|Boletus auripes {{somewhat}} resembles B.aurantiosplendens, but {{the latter}} species {{has a more}} variably colored cap that can be orange, brownish orange, or yellowish, and variable degrees of stem reticulation.

B.auripes bears a superficial resemblance in coloration to the Costa Rican species B.lychnipes, known only from a limited area in the northern Cordillera de Talamanca. The latter species may be distinguished {{by the lack of}} reticulations on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> of the stem, a brown or salmon-pink staining reaction on the stem in response to handling, and microscopically by a conspicuously sterile margin and prominent pseudocystidia. Retiboletus retipes is set apart from B.auripes by a darker cap, tubes that lack an olive tinge, and a stem that has more prominent reticulation extending down to the base.
