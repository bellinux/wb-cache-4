5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; the {{birthday}} {{is associated with}} <b>the</b> <b>self,</b> <b>and</b> hence the numbers in the birthday are preferred, {{despite the fact that}} they appear in many other contexts. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the birthday-number effect. A similar effect, the name-letter effect, has been found for letters: people tend to prefer the letters that are part of their name. The birthday-number effect and the name-letter effect are significantly correlated. In psychological assessments, the Number Preference Task is used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E

5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, and if he did, he would {{make up for it}} by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic in the formation of <b>the</b> <b>self,</b> <b>and</b> his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Henry Huxley defends in {{an essay}} titled On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History an epiphenomenalist theory of {{consciousness}} according to which consciousness is a causally inert effect of neural activity — “as the steam-whistle which accompanies {{the work of a}} locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery”. To this William James objects in his essay Are We Automata? by stating an evolutionary argument for mind-brain interaction implying that if the preservation and development of consciousness in the biological evolution is a result of natural selection, it is plausible that consciousness has not only been influenced by neural processes, but has had a survival value itself; and it could only have had this if it had been efficacious. Karl Popper develops in the book <b>The</b> <b>Self</b> <b>and</b> Its Brain a similar evolutionary argument.|$|E
50|$|The Upanishads {{teach that}} Brahman, 'the First Cause', {{in itself is}} devoid of attributes, devoid of any form (Brahma Sutra III.ii14).

5|$|Zhu Xi {{was one of}} {{many critics}} who argued that {{government}} schools did not sufficiently encourage personal cultivation of <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> molded students into officials who cared only for profit and salary. Not all social and political philosophers in the Song period blamed the examination system as {{the root of the problem}} (but merely as a method of recruitment and selection), emphasizing instead the gentry's failure to take responsibility in society as the cultural elite. Zhu Xi also laid emphasis on the Four Books, a series of Confucian classics that would become the official introduction of education for all Confucian students, yet were initially discarded by his contemporaries. After his death, his commentary on the Four Books found appeal amongst scholar-officials and in 1241 his writings were adopted as mandatory readings for examination candidates with the support of Emperor Lizong (r. 1224–1264).|$|E

25|$|The {{potency of}} <b>the</b> {{personal}} <b>self</b> <b>and</b> relational ties distinguish identity fusion from {{other forms of}} alignment with groups, such as “group identification”. In group identification, allegiance to the collective eclipses <b>the</b> personal <b>self</b> <b>and</b> relational ties to other group members. Because of this, <b>the</b> personal <b>self</b> <b>and</b> relational ties are not as involved in theories of group identification. Identity fusion theorizes that fusion measures should be more predictive of extreme pro-group behavior than previously proposed measures of identification. In fact, there is growing evidence of this. Measures of identity fusion are particularly powerful predictors of personally costly pro-group behaviors, including endorsement of extreme behaviors, such as fighting and dying for the group.|$|R

25|$|Sruti (scriptures), proper {{reasoning}} and meditation {{are the main}} sources of knowledge (vidya) for the Advaita Vedanta tradition.

5000|$|Concentration (Samadhi) is {{the state}} of {{equality}} of both <b>the</b> individual <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> highest <b>self.</b> It may also be defined as the abiding of <b>the</b> inner <b>self</b> in Brahman. ...In concentration <b>the</b> individual <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> supreme <b>self</b> become one. —Yoga Yajnavalkya 10.1-5 [...] Chapter 10 states meditation practice perfects one's ability to concentrate, wherein the object one concentrates on becomes the one of attachment, of oneness and one feels one's identity with it. Verses 10.6-15 suggest that one must concentrate on <b>self</b> as <b>the</b> supreme <b>self,</b> oneness with Brahman in everything, and this process of attachment of one's individual <b>self</b> to <b>the</b> supreme <b>self</b> leads to oneness and liberation.|$|R
25|$|Remembering {{with feeling}} {{ultimately}} leads {{the patient to}} understand {{that he or she}} had no opportunity to choose from a selection of possible ways of experiencing <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> of relating with others, and had few, if any, options other than to develop a schizoid stance toward others. The false self was simply the best way in which the patient could experience the repetitive predictable acknowledgment, affirmation, and approval necessary for emotional survival while warding off the effects associated with the abandonment depression.|$|E
25|$|In August 2007 Blanke's lab {{published}} research in Science demonstrating that conflicting visual-somatosensory input in virtual reality could disrupt the spatial unity between <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> the body. During multisensory conflict, participants {{felt as if}} a virtual body seen {{in front of them}} was their own body and mislocalized themselves toward the virtual body, to a position outside their bodily borders. This indicates that spatial unity and bodily self-consciousness can be studied experimentally and is based on multisensory and cognitive processing of bodily information.|$|E
25|$|If {{we accept}} pains as special qualia known {{absolutely}} but exclusively by the solitary minds that perceive them, {{this may be}} taken to ground a Cartesian view of <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> consciousness.

Against this, one might acknowledge the absolute fact of one's own pain, but claim skepticism {{about the existence of}} anyone else's pains.
