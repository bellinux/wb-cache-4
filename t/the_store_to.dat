5|$|The Gurdon Bill Store {{is named}} for Gurdon Bill, {{who was born in}} 1784. The land was {{originally}} purchased by Bill and his partner, Philip Gray, in 1818. Clouette notes that four years later, Bill was the sole owner of the property; a record from 1819 says Gray sold his interest in <b>the</b> <b>store</b> <b>to</b> Bill for $500. Bill continued to run the store until shortly before his death in 1856. At age 21, Bill went to Plainfield Academy and later went on to work with various merchants before setting up the store in North Groton, later incorporated as Ledyard, Connecticut. Clouette notes a brief passage of the store out of the Bill family, soon reacquired, before it was sold to the Congregational Society in 1875. The Congregational Society has made limited use of the store, preserving its historical integrity. Local historians speculate that the store's final transaction was made in 1868; afterwards the store was boarded up and left essentially unused.|$|E

25|$|The {{programming}} language {{to be employed}} by users was akin to modern day assembly languages.

There were three separate readers for {{the three types of}} cards.|$|E
