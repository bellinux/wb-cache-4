On 9 September 1944, No.410 Squadron RCAF was again moved to RAF Hunsdon. Thirteen days later, <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> was relocated back to their sixth base, RAF Coleby Grange. On 3 November 1944 <b>the</b> <b>Squadron</b> moved to RAF Amiens-Glisy in northern France. Two months later, <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> was relocated to RAF Lille-Vendeville in northern France, the first movement of <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> in 1945. From 5 April 1945 the Cougars were back at RAF Amiens-Glisy, and the final move of the war occurred on 9 June 1945, when <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> relocated to RAF Gilze-Rijen in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|In November, <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> was {{transferred}} to the Balkans to help the Greek Air Force oppose the Italian invasion. On 8 November, <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> and its new Gladiator IIs moved from their base at Sidi Haneish to Abu Suweir. There the pilots were granted two days leave. On 16 November 1940, <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> arrived in Athens and moved to airfields north of the capital. Pattle's aerodrome was situated at Eleusis. They stayed to organise <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> into flights but moved to the Albanian–Greek border town of Trikkala hours later.|$|E
5|$|Around 15 RAF squadrons {{received}} various {{marks of}} Phantom, {{many of them}} based in Germany. The first to be equipped was No. 6 Squadron at RAF Leuchars in July 1969. One noteworthy deployment was to No. 43 Squadron where Phantom FG1s remained <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> equipment for 20 years, arriving in September 1969 and departing in July 1989. During this period <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> was based at Leuchars.|$|E

5|$|C Squadron {{completed}} its training in New Zealand and {{was attached to}} the Second Echelon of the 2NZEF, in adherence with plans to send one squadron of the regiment to Egypt with the Second Echelon. <b>The</b> <b>squadron</b> was diverted to Britain, while en route to Egypt, when Italy entered the war, and arrived on 16 June. <b>The</b> <b>squadron</b> was based near Aldershot and conducted further training there. C Squadron became part of the Second Echelon's Headquarters Covering Force, defending Britain against German invasion. In early September, <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> was moved to Westwell, Kent; it underwent further training and was sent back to Aldershot in November. C Squadron left Britain for Egypt on 4 January 1941.|$|E
5|$|During its existence, No. 351 Squadron flew 227 combat missions: 119 {{ground attack}} sorties, 87 {{reconnaissance}} missions, 19 maritime interdictions, and two search-and-rescue missions. Of the 23 pilots that passed through <b>the</b> <b>squadron,</b> four {{were killed and}} one captured. <b>The</b> <b>squadron</b> lost nine aircraft, and 38 others suffered damage, mainly from anti-aircraft fire. <b>The</b> <b>squadron</b> was released from RAF control on 16 May 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, {{the ship}} {{was sent to the}} Mediterranean to {{reinforce}} the Second Special Mission Squadron as it escorted Allied troop convoys across the Mediterranean. In November, she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Kōzō Satō, <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> commander, as the bulk of <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> sailed to Constantinople, arriving on 6 December. The ship then sailed to Portland to escort the surrendered German submarines allocated to Japan back home. She arrived on 5 January 1919 and <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> departed for Malta at the end of March. After refitting some of the submarines there, <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> arrived at Yokosuka on 18 June.|$|E
50|$|The {{regiment}} was {{organised into}} four squadrons, {{each of which}} perpetuates one of the antecedent regiments: <b>the</b> 16th Lancer <b>Squadron,</b> <b>the</b> 17th Lancer <b>Squadron,</b> <b>the</b> 21st Lancer <b>Squadron</b> and <b>the</b> 5th Lancer <b>Squadron.</b>|$|R
50|$|In March 1958 the C-119Gs of <b>the</b> three <b>squadrons</b> were {{returned}} to CONUS, and <b>the</b> <b>squadrons</b> were inactivated.|$|R

5|$|In 1956 growing {{diplomatic}} {{tensions in}} the Middle East, tensions that would soon culminate in the Suez Crisis, resulted in the resurrection of 69 Squadron. On April 19 the IAF issued an order reactivating <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> at Ramat David, with Nahum Efrat as its commanding officer. <b>The</b> <b>squadron</b> was soon tasked with its first mission, allocating two B-17s for search and rescue operations during Dassault Mystère delivery flights from France to Israel. The reformed squadron once again began training personnel and equipping the aircraft for possible hostilities. As Israel purchased more jet fighters, however, room {{had to be made}} for the new arrivals, and in September 1956 the IAF ordered <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> to send its aircraft into storage and changed its status to reserve. By October 3 the aircraft had been stored at Bedek Aviation (later Israeli Aircraft Industries) at Lod, but only three weeks later, on October 25, the IAF activated <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> once more.|$|E
5|$|In May 1950, Bolt was {{reassigned to}} VMF-224 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, and he {{remained}} there until May 1951. <b>The</b> <b>squadron</b> flew the F2H Banshee and {{within three months}} of joining the unit he had flown more hours on the aircraft than any other pilot in <b>the</b> <b>squadron.</b> This {{was followed by a}} quick four-month tour on the staff at the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing. During this time, the US Air Force was operating its first squadron of F-86 Sabre aircraft. The Sabres were the only U.S. aircraft which performed well against the MiG-15s operated by China and North Korea in the Korean War. Bolt used his connections to enter an exchange program with the USAF in September 1951, becoming an exchange officer with the 318th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at McChord Air Force Base in Washington flying the F-94 Starfire. Soon after, he began piloting the F-86F Sabre which had been transferred to <b>the</b> <b>squadron.</b> He continued training with <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> and was promoted to major in December 1951.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} in September 1941 that <b>the</b> <b>Squadron</b> {{received}} the proto-type Lancaster bomber, the first squadron of the RAF to receive the new aircraft. On a visit to <b>the</b> <b>Squadron</b> in December, Guest and Meredith were taken on a flight in the new plane. Although the order was given in December to cease operations in the Hampdens, {{it was not until}} 3 March 1942 that the Lancaster was put on active service on its first battle mission for the entire RAF. <b>The</b> <b>Squadron,</b> with its Lancasters, was given key targets to bomb: on 17 April 1942, six Lancasters from 44 Squadron alongside six from 97 Squadron, bombed the MAN diesel engine factory, which produced {{more than half of the}} German U-boats, as well as engines for ships, tanks and transport vehicles. The success – at a cost of five planes and crew to 44 Squadron – earned the thanks of the Prime Minister himself. <b>The</b> <b>Squadron</b> was further involved in the obliteration of Rostock on 8 May and took part in the 1,000-aircraft attack on Cologne on 30 May.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Insignia of <b>the</b> 303 Polish <b>Squadron,</b> during World War II, {{would be}} {{identical}} {{with that of}} <b>the</b> Kościuszko <b>Squadron.</b> <b>The</b> 303 <b>Squadron</b> honour badge had [...] "303" [...] added to <b>the</b> original Kościuszko <b>Squadron</b> emblem.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> two <b>squadrons,</b> a CAF Directorate of Air Services was formed, {{which was a}} branch of the General Staff of the Overseas Military Forces of Canada. The CAF's first commander, Lt. Col. W. A Bishop began setting up <b>the</b> <b>squadrons</b> in August 1918. <b>The</b> two <b>squadrons</b> never fought during the war, which ended on 11 November 1918. <b>The</b> <b>squadrons</b> were administered by No. 1 Wing CAF, which was formed in March 1919.|$|R
50|$|The Armoured Battalion (Panserbataljonen) has the {{majority}} of its constituents labeled eskadroner.

5|$|On 14 September, <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> began flying {{missions}} to escort B-24 Liberator bombers. The Japanese had 200 aircraft at Kahili Airfield and Balalae Island, opposed by only 50 aircraft from the U.S. squadrons in the area. The {{first couple of}} missions that <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> undertook were relatively quiet but, on 16 September, VMF-214 was attacked {{by a group of}} 35 Japanese A6M Zeros. <b>The</b> <b>squadron</b> repelled the strike, destroying 11 Japanese aircraft for the loss of only one of their own. Several costly engagements with the strong Japanese forces in the area followed. Bolt did not score any victories during this time, but was promoted to first lieutenant that month.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October MacLachlan was {{promoted}} to flying officer, and undertook an attack mission. During {{the course of the}} flight his wingtip made contact with the ground but he was able to return to base. <b>The</b> <b>squadron</b> settled down into winter quarters until March when they were reassigned to the French border region with Spain. On 1 April he celebrated his 21st birthday and took the opportunity of driving from Perpignan across the frontier into the Pyrenees to celebrate it. On 9 April <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> was put on alert when the Germans invaded Denmark and Norway and <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> were soon relocated to northern France at Mourmelon. On 10 May the Phoney War came to a close with the German invasion of Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, she was assigned to the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet. On 28 August 1914 she was present, but played no significant role, in the Battle of Heligoland Bight, Several months later, the Germans bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 16 December and the 1st LCS was escorting Vice-Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers in response when it encountered a German light cruiser and a half-flotilla of torpedo boats. Falmouth was not in range to engage before <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> turned away to follow the battlecruisers. On 28 December, the ship was transferred to the 3rd LCS and became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Trevylyan Napier, <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> commander. During the Battle of Dogger Bank on 24 January 1915, <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> escorted the Grand Fleet, but was not engaged. After the battle was over, <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> escorted the battlecruisers on their way back to Cromarty, Scotland.|$|E
50|$|The 1st Weather Group is {{organized}} into three continental United States <b>squadrons.</b> Each of <b>the</b> <b>squadrons</b> produces forecasts for a specified {{area of the}} United States. <b>The</b> <b>squadrons</b> also serve as training hubs for new weather professionals - both enlisted and officers.|$|R
50|$|The new base {{houses the}} Republic of Singapore Air Force's 145 <b>Squadron,</b> which {{comprises}} <b>the</b> extended-range, attack oriented F-16D Block 52+ Fighting Falcons, {{as well as}} <b>the</b> 208 <b>Squadron,</b> <b>the</b> 808 <b>Squadron</b> and <b>the</b> 508 <b>Squadron.</b>|$|R

Surviving squadron members founded a squadron association in 2011 to preserve the heritage of the unit.|$|E
5|$|The Hammers flew 28 support, 13 {{reconnaissance}} and 6 combat air patrols during Operation Litani, Israel's March 1978 {{invasion of}} Lebanon. In 1976 <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> had received two additional RF-4Es, {{and was soon}} flying high-altitude reconnaissance. This led to its participation in the preparations for the 1981 Operation Opera to destroy Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor, which the Hammers were initially planned to conduct. <b>The</b> <b>squadron</b> trained for the raid using the Tadmit, but these plans were dropped when the F-16 entered IAF service in 1980. On November 12, 1980, <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> carried out the IAF's longest fighter mission hitherto, when two reconnaissance birds photographed the reactor near Baghdad. The mission witnessed three aerial refuelings, including one over enemy territory. Tensions over Lebanon flared once more in 1981, and on May 29, 1981, <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> carried out Operation Mole 9, striking Libyan SA-9 batteries protecting PLO bases near Beirut.|$|E
5|$|The largest plant task {{undertaken}} {{during the}} deployment was {{the construction of}} an airstrip at Opuwo. <b>The</b> <b>squadron</b> commander, Major David Crago, described how the road network in Namibia was better than expected; in retrospect, <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> brought too much heavy road-making equipment. <b>The</b> <b>squadron</b> deployed 20 members of the Plant Troop (under Captain Nigel Catchlove) to Opuwo. Over a period of four months, Sergeant Ken Roma constructed an all-weather airstrip {{in one of the most}} remote parts of Namibia.|$|E

50|$|There {{were several}} episodes {{involving}} space combat between the Interplanetary Space Force and various enemies. After the Space Angel {{and his crew}} had discovered the villains' plans or forces, he would call in reinforcements made up {{of one or more}} <b>squadrons</b> of <b>the</b> ISF. <b>Squadrons</b> were organized by planetary patrol areas such as <b>the</b> Venusian <b>Squadron,</b> Mars <b>Squadron,</b> etc. <b>The</b> identifying <b>squadron</b> symbols on <b>the</b> ISF ships were the ones used in astronomy charts of the time to identify the planets, such as the Female symbol for <b>the</b> Venusian <b>Squadron,</b> <b>the</b> Male symbol for <b>the</b> Mars <b>Squadron</b> and a circle with an enclosed plus sign for <b>the</b> Earth <b>Squadron.</b>|$|R
5|$|The ships had a {{standard}} crew of 38 officers and 726 enlisted men. Scharnhorst, as <b>the</b> <b>squadron</b> flagship, had a larger crew, including an additional 14 officers and 62 men.
