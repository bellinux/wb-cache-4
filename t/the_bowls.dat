5|$|The ACC's {{representatives to}} these bowls were picked in a {{hierarchical}} system {{that allowed the}} Chick-fil-A Bowl to have the first selection after the Orange Bowl's automatic pick of {{the winner of the}} ACC Championship Game. Following the Chick-fil-A Bowl were the Gator Bowl, Champs Sports Bowl, Music City Bowl, Meineke Car Care Bowl, Emerald Bowl, and Humanitarian Bowl, in that order. The ACC's agreement with <b>the</b> <b>bowls</b> dictated that <b>the</b> <b>bowls</b> would select the highest-ranking ACC team left after <b>the</b> <b>bowls</b> with higher selections made their pick. Bowls would be allowed to skip the highest remaining team only if the next team was within one conference win of the highest remaining team. Therefore, a bowl could select a 53 team over a 62 team, but could not select a 44 team over a 62 team.|$|E

5|$|The Sydney punchbowls, made in China during Emperor Chia Ch'ing's {{reign in}} 1796–1820, {{are the only}} two known {{examples}} of Chinese export porcelain hand painted with Sydney scenes and dating from the Macquarie era. <b>The</b> <b>bowls</b> were procured in Canton about three decades after the First Fleet's arrival at Port Jackson where the British settlement at Sydney Cove was established in 1788. They also represent the trading between Australia and China via India at the time. Even though decorated punchbowls were prestigious items used for drinking punch at social gatherings during the 18th and 19th centuries, it is not known who originally commissioned these bowls or what special occasion they were made for.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} part of the commune is hilly but relatively favorable to agriculture, while the southern part is flat and characterized by sand dunes. Sixteen caves are found within the area. The earth is mainly composed of stony rocks, sandy loam soils, and clay loam soils in the beds of wadis in the area. The soils in the hills have pockets of alluvium and sandy loam suitable for crop development, particularly on the hillsides and {{at the foot of the}} hills. Clay loam soils are found in <b>the</b> <b>bowls</b> and beds of wadis, which although suitable for farming are susceptible to gully and water erosion during the rainy season.|$|E

5|$|In Miami, first-ranked Maryland {{faced the}} team Tatum had coached {{prior to his}} arrival at College Park: fourth-ranked Oklahoma under former {{assistant}} Bud Wilkinson. The Sooners handed Maryland their only defeat, 0–7, but—as had happened in 1951 to the Terrapins' detriment—the final rankings were released before <b>the</b> <b>bowls,</b> and {{for the third time}} in four years, AP's national champion was defeated in their postseason game. However, unlike Tennessee, who retained their top-rank despite losing to Maryland in 1951, the Terrapins (10–1–0) did indeed finish with the best record, better than the Orange Bowl victor, Oklahoma (9–1–1). Maryland ranked first nationally in terms of rushing defense (83.9 yards allowed per game) and scoring defense (3.1 points allowed per game). At the same time, the Terps scored a record combined total of 298 points, a number not exceeded until 1967.|$|E
5|$|The punchbowls are a 'harlequin pair', {{similar but}} not exactly matching. <b>The</b> <b>bowls</b> have been donated independently, {{one to the}} State Library of New South Wales (SLNSW) in 1926 {{and the other to}} the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM) in 2006. The Library bowl is the more widely known of the pair. Its {{earliest}} provenance places it in England in the late 1840s, where it is said to originally have been commissioned for William Bligh; another source suggests Henry Colden Antill. It passed through several owners in Britain before it was presented to the State Library. The Museum bowl's first provenance is from England in 1932 and {{it has been suggested that}} it was made to the order of Arthur Phillip. Its whereabouts were unknown until it appeared in the Newark Museum, United States, in 1988, on loan from Peter Frelinghuysen Jr.. Through donations, the Maritime Museum later acquired the punchbowl from Frelinghuysen.|$|E
5|$|Whilst the {{drinking}} of punch from punchbowls was an actual social {{practice of the}} times, the Sydney Cove punchbowls were specially commissioned and expensive items which had other purposes. Such punchbowls were prestigious items owned by individuals of high rank in society, such as John Hosking Sydney's first elected Mayor, and New York's fourth Governor Daniel Tomkins, who also acquired a punchbowl. The two punchbowls, previously owned by Hosking, are the first Chinese objects acquired by the Australiana Fund. <b>The</b> <b>bowls</b> could also have been commissioned as commemorative gifts, like the 1812 Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania Union Lodge punchbowl gift. and the New York City punchbowl presented to the City of New York on 4July 1812. It has also been suggested that, given the Aboriginal marriage motif, the Sydney punchbowls {{may have been a}} marriage gift. Punchbowls were also regarded as exotic souvenirs at the time.|$|E

5000|$|Hot stone pot bibimbap (dolsot-bibimbap (돌솥 비빔밥)) is a {{variation}} of bibimbap served in a very hot dolsot (stone pot) in which a raw egg is cooked against the sides of <b>the</b> <b>bowl.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bowl</b> is so hot that anything that touches it sizzles for minutes. Before the rice is placed in <b>the</b> <b>bowl,</b> <b>the</b> bottom of <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> is coated with sesame oil, making the layer of the rice touching <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> cook to a crisp, golden brown (누릉지).

5|$|The International Bowl had {{contracts}} with the Big East and Mid-American Conferences {{that allowed them to}} select one team from each conference to participate in their annual game. By virtue of being the Big East champion Cincinnati was awarded an automatic Bowl Championship Series berth; they would play in the 2009 Orange Bowl. The Gator Bowl and Sun Bowl shared the second pick of Big East teams; after the Gator Bowl opted to select Big 12 member Nebraska and the Sun Bowl learned {{that they would not be}} allowed to select Notre Dame, Pittsburgh received the Sun Bowl invitation. The Meineke Car Care Bowl, which had the third selection, picked West Virginia. The fourth, fifth, and sixth selections of Big East teams belonged collectively to the International Bowl, PapaJohns.com Bowl, and St. Petersburg Bowl, which, in consultation with the Big East, decided which schools were the best fit for each bowl. There were three remaining bowl-eligible Big East teams: Connecticut, Rutgers, and South Florida. The previous season, Rutgers had played in the International Bowl and South Florida had appeared in the PapaJohns.com Bowl; bowls in general dislike inviting the same team in consecutive years, on the theory that fans are less likely to want to travel to the same destination they were at the year before. Additionally, the St. Petersburg Bowl, in its inaugural year, sought to have local team South Florida play in their game to drive local attendance. Therefore, the teams were apportioned among <b>the</b> <b>bowls</b> as follows: South Florida to the St. Petersburg Bowl, Rutgers to the PapaJohns.com Bowl, and Connecticut to the International Bowl. On December7,2008, UConn formally accepted the bowl invitation, the third in their history.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the pick}} order usually {{corresponds}} to the conference standings, <b>the</b> <b>bowls</b> {{are not required to}} make their choices strictly according to the won-lost records; many factors influence bowl selections, especially the likely turnout of the team's fans.

50|$|The {{effect of}} the {{secondary}} flow can be demonstrated using a circular <b>bowl.</b> Partly fill <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> with water and sprinkle dense particles such as sand or rice into <b>the</b> <b>bowl.</b> Set <b>the</b> water into circular motion with one hand or a spoon. The dense particles quickly sweep into a neat pile {{in the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>bowl.</b> This is <b>the</b> mechanism that leads to the formation of point bars and contributes to the formation of oxbow lakes. The primary flow of water in <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> is circular and the streamlines are concentric with the side of <b>the</b> <b>bowl.</b> However, <b>the</b> secondary flow of the boundary layer across the floor of <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> is inward toward the center.
