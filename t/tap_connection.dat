40|$|Abstract—Multilayer superconducting {{quadrature}} hybrids for diplexer {{applications are}} {{reported for the}} first time in this paper. The hybrids employ highly miniature lumped element components embedded within four metal layers. The thin dielectric layers be-tween the metal layers and the small feature size of the process allow for the miniaturization of lumped element capacitors and in-ductors. Hybrid-coupled diplexers using lumped element hybrids and filters have been developed, fabricated, and tested. A novel filter configuration that employs inter-resonator <b>tap</b> <b>connections</b> is also demonstrated for implementation in wideband filter appli-cations. The whole integrated high (quality factor) diplexer is highly miniaturized being approximately in size at a fre-quency of 1. 0 GHz. The diplexer structures are amenable to su-perconductor microelectronics technology and can be integrated monolithically with a superconducting receiver on a single chip.

The liner pressure rating declined significantly when geometrical imperfections in the form of longitudinal folds coincided with the gap in the host pipe. The integrity of an internally reconnected <b>tap</b> <b>connection</b> subjected to high, prolonged, monotonic internal pressure was found to be sound. However, the lateral reconnection method used appeared to result in a measurable reduction in the cross-sectional area of the connection at the tap-main. 1...|$|E

A tap water connection is found to add from 10 per cent to 52 per cent to sales values of homes in our sample. The estimated mean values of gaining tap water access represent 1 – 5 per cent of real household income, differing by city and with generally higher values in El Salvador. On average this gain eliminates between 1 per cent and 3 per cent of the initial difference in real incomes between the groups of connected and unconnected households. We also find large differences {{in the value of}} a <b>tap</b> <b>connection</b> depending on the main source of non-tap water, with lowest values when the source is a private well in El Salvador. ...|$|E

In this paper, mitigation techniques that can lower the error floor are adopted in both encoder and decoder. Optimum tap connections are listed for codes with constraint lengths 3, 4, and 5. Performance variations achieved by changing different parameters are investigated. Simulation results show that (1) using 10 decoding iterations is adequate; (2) the S-random interleaving provides the best performance among the interleaves investigated; (3) using codes with constraint lengths greater than 3 does not buy any additional coding gain for short block size (in the vicinity of 100); (4) for block size greater than 500, no significant improvement is noticed by increasing the constraint length from 4 to 5 in the range of bit error rate (BER) < 1 o– 6; and (5) the punctured rate 1 / 2 code structure degrades the performance by only 0. 5 to 0. 7 dB in comparison with the classic rate 1 / 3 turbo code for constraint lengths 3, 4, and 5. ...|$|E

The reflectometry technique involves the excitation of the circuit under test with either a fast edge step function or a well-defined impulse confined in time and frequency domains, and thereafter detection of the amplitude and time of the reflections.

40|$|With {{population}} growth and urbanization, demand for improved water services has been growing. It is imperative therefore to examine different factors that influence demand for improved water services and the resultant welfare changes. Using cross-sectional household survey data collected through structured questionnaire from ten administrative units in Mekelle City, we estimate household willingness to pay models and identify major determinant factors of demand for improved water service. In order to help us do this, we considered selection issues and estimated models using the Heckman Two-Step Estimator. Our {{results show that the}} amount of bid (amount of money households {{would be willing to pay}}) that households (already connected to private taps) would be willing to pay is positively associated with household income, ownership of the house, price of vended water and the practice of water purification. For households who are not connected to private taps, the amount they would be willing to pay for (improved) private <b>tap</b> <b>connection</b> is positively associated with formal education, housing status and gender. We also investigate the welfare gains and losses as a result of improved water service.

40|$|In {{the light}} of global {{environmental}} change, aridity in the South of Morocco {{is expected to increase}} while water availability is projected to decrease. Human activities, especially irrigation agriculture, are further impacting on resource degradation. Though the government has attempted to respond to these challenges, the rural South remains poorly developed. Water institutions are created on national and regional level to improve drinking water supply in rural settlements, but seem unable to respond to the most pressing problems. The access to safe drinking water is not guaranteed and water management is ineffective. Katharina Graf, supervised by Professor Dr. Bernd Diekkrüger (Department of Geography, University of Bonn) and Professor Dr. Martin Rössler (Department of Ethnology, University of Cologne), studies the drinking water supply in rural southern Morocco and explores the local options for action against a background of institutional constraints and increasing water scarcity. In 1995 a new water policy was adopted to improve the access to safe drinking water in rural Morocco. Since then, household water management has been based on two water facilities: a conventional draw well and a domestic <b>tap</b> <b>connection.</b> Assuming a scenario of increased water usage, Katharina Graf compares two villages located in the arid Middle Drâa Valley to assess to what extent rural water withdrawal and management are influenced by the above mentioned global, national and regional trends. She looks at these factors and their inter-linkages through an actor-oriented approach to investigate the options local actors have in managing the scarce resource. Drawing on both New Institutionalism and the Natural Resource Management approach, she analyses rural patterns of drinking water management. The analysis suggests that water management is dysfunctional due to the prefabrication of water institutions outside of the village context, while the rising withdrawal is determined by a local adaptation to it. The latter process draws on existing informal institutions which fill the gaps left by formal ones, and together these institutions constitute a flexible but fragile water management solution. The options for local action subject to these constraints appear reduced and leave doubts on the ability of rural households to flexibly manage an ever scarcer water availability. Michael J.

In many cases it is desirable to monitor the data traffic flowing between two points in a copper or fiber based Operational or Onboard Network System (ONS) for Flight Test Instrumentation (FTI) purposes because these ONS systems may carry important data {{which can be used}} without duplicating/installing a specific FTI data acquisition system to receive this data. The two types of network taps that can be used are Inline Network Taps and network end-point taps. This paper examines the usage of Inline Network Taps for FTI applications and how they can support network access strategies and objectives. An Inline Network Tap is a hardware device which allows access to data flowing across a network. These devices are typically active/powered and have a number of ports: a first tap port, a second tap port, and one or more mirror ports. An in-line network tap inserted {{between the first and second}} tap port passes all data traffic through unimpeded but also copies that same data to one or more mirror ports. Some Inline Network Tap devices may also pass packets when the tap is not powered or a malfunction is detected on the device via an integrated by-pass function. If the Inline Network Tap device goes offline the unit automatically bypasses the <b>tap</b> <b>connection</b> and data traffic is directed through the bypass directly to network devices. This capability is crucial for inline usage on mission critical network segments that cannot afford the risk of losing the network connection. An in-line network tap can either be based on copper or fiber technology and as a "filterable" network tap can also provide advanced packet filtering capabilities. These filterable network taps can selectively pass data, e. g., based on VLAN ID or other parameters, to a mirror port for deep analysis, monitoring and recording. Another advanced tap function that is presented in this paper is the support for inserting time stamps at the tap level in monitored packets which provides a reference time when the data content of a given packet was generated at a data source. This capability is a significant feature for FTI applications as most ONS systems do not provide time stamped data...|$|E
