Other venues could include <b>the</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>of</b> Fides or <b>the</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>of</b> Concord, or, if the meeting was outside of the formal boundary of the city, at <b>the</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>of</b> Apollo or (if a war meeting) at <b>the</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>of</b> Bellona. In addition, the Senate operated while under various religious restrictions. For example, before any meeting could begin, a sacrifice to the gods was made, and a search for divine omens (the auspices) was taken. The auspices were taken in order to determine whether that particular Senate meeting held favor with the gods. The Senate was only allowed to meet in a building of religious significance, such as the Curia Hostilia.|$|E

The Eblaite deity Kura was also venerated in Nagar, and the monarchs are attested visiting <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> <b>of</b> the Semitic deity Dagon in Tuttul.
