5000|$|Based on the <b>Tlower</b> {{equation}} it can {{be found}} that the screw is self-locking when the coefficient of friction is greater than the tangent of the lead angle. An equivalent comparison is when the friction angle is greater than the lead angle (...) [...] When this is not true the screw will back-drive, or lower {{under the weight of the}} load.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the ovule and the embryo sac of five of the 17 species of Lycium and of one hybrid, recorded for southern Africa, was investigated. All specimens of four of the species and the hybrid (between a hermaphroditic and a functionally dioecious species) {{were found to be}} functionally dioecious: they express only one sex, although both male and female organs are present in the same <b>tlower.</b> One species was hermaphroditic. The embryo sacs of all species, and of the hybrid, were of the normal eight-nucleate Polygonum type. The structure of the ovary and the {{development of}} the embryo sac {{are similar to those of}} L europaeum L. The absence of unreduced embryo sacs indicates that apomixis does not occur at any ploidy level in the species studied. </p...|$|E
40|$|The spotted-wing {{drosophila}} (D rosophila suzukii Matsumura) is an {{invasive species}} of Asian origin {{that is now}} widely distributed in North America and Europe. Because of the female’s serrated ovipositor, eggs are laid in preharvest fruit, causing large economic losses in cultivated berries and stone fruit. Modeling D. suzukii population dynamics and potential distribution will require information on its thermal tolerance. Large summer populations {{have been found in}} regions with severe winter conditions, though little is known about responses to prolonged low-temperature exposure. We used controlled chambers to examine D. suzukii fecundity, development rate, and mortality across a range of temperatures encompassing the upper and lower thresholds (5 – 35 °C). Optimal temperatures (Topt) were found to be 28. 2 °C {{for the development of the}} egg-to-adult stage, and 22. 9 °C for reproductive output. No adult eclosion occurred below 8. 1 °C (<b>Tlower)</b> or above 30. 9 °C (Tupper). We also investigated survival outcomes following prolonged (42 -d) low-temperature exposure to a simulated cold winter (− 5, − 3, − 1, 1, 3, and 5 °C). Adult survival was dependent on temperature, with a mean LT 50 of 4. 9 °C. There were no effects of sex, mating status, geographic strain, and photoperiod preexposure on overwintering survival. Thirty-eight percent of females that were mated prior, but not after, prolonged low-temperature exposure produced viable offspring, suggesting that this species may undergo sperm storage. This study provides data on the thermal tolerances of D. suzukii, which can be used for models of D. suzukii population dynamics, degree-day, and distribution models...|$|E
