5|$|In 1996, Mugabe was {{appointed}} {{chair of the}} defence arm of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Without consulting parliament, in August 1998 he ordered Zimbabwean troops into the Congo to side with President Laurent Kabila in the Second Congo War. He initially committed 3000 <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> operation, although this gradually rose to 11,000. He also persuaded Angola and Namibia to commit <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conflict. Involvement in the war cost Zimbabwe an approximate US $1 million a day, contributing to its economic problems. Opinion polls demonstrated that it was unpopular among Zimbabwe's population. However, several Zimbabwean businesses profited, having been given mining and timber concessions and preferential trade terms in minerals from Kabila's government.|$|E

50|$|Opponents also {{claim that}} without ground <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> secure <b>the</b> border, top Ba'athist regime members {{fled the country}} with vast Iraqi funds and foreign insurgents moved into the country. There were not enough <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> defend <b>the</b> Iraqi border from foreign-backed insurgents.|$|R
5|$|As the Byzantine Empire {{continued}} {{the conquest of}} Latin territory, the Turks under Osman I began their raids into Byzantine Anatolia; Söğüt and Eskişehir were taken in 1265 and 1289 respectively. Michael Palaeologus was unable {{to deal with these}} early setbacks due to the need to transfer <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West.|$|E
5|$|Bridgwater {{became the}} first town in Britain to {{petition}} the government to ban slavery, in 1785.

Travel far and wide, with associated opportunities for engineer support, construction and parachuting continued as ever. At times, troops carried out annual camps in direct {{support of their}} battalions, such as 299's 1972 camp with 4 Para in Jamaica, whilst on other occasions the squadron exercised as a whole. In 1973, the squadron undertook Exercise Sacristan in the United Arab Emirates, which saw 180 members of the squadron deploy for between two and six weeks, carrying out a variety of construction tasks and desert training exercises.

5|$|Despite {{the initial}} success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, {{amassing}} new funds and recruits. The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings {{showed that the}} Taliban had returned. In 2006, the Taliban insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success. As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country in March 2007.|$|E

5|$|Even though several special police {{units were}} {{transformed}} into the Croatian National Guard (later renamed the Croatian Army) in 1991, the special police continued to operate throughout the war as special forces units supporting virtually all army operations. The last large deployment of the special police in the war occurred in Operation Storm in August 1995, when the force contributed 3,100 <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> offensive.

5|$|In August, Wartensleben's {{autonomous}} corps {{united with}} Charles' imperial troops {{and turned the}} tide against the French.

France, the former colonial power, also assisted the operation by airlifting AU <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|E
5|$|Moving <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front {{ahead of}} the attack was {{nonetheless}} extremely difficult, as {{the only means of}} approaching the front line were narrow boardwalks made of wood planking, which wound between the shell-holes. Slipping off the duckboards could often be deadly with unfortunate soldiers frequently drowning in mud under the weight of their own equipment. On account of the exhausting nature of the trip, the leading assault units entered the support line four days before the battle, to ensure soldiers would be as fresh as possible for the attack.|$|E
5|$|Romania's own {{armistice}} {{with the}} Central Powers put the recruitment project on a complete standstill, and diminished {{the effort to}} move Transylvanian-Bukovinan soldiers into the single new force.
