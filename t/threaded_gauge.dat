40|$|The article {{presents}} a methodology for modelling {{the control of}} a <b>threaded</b> plug <b>gauge.</b> There had been examined works of scientists who had studied the aspects of the average thread diameter control and studied the problems of providing and {{improving the quality of}} threaded joints. At a modern machine-building enterprise, <b>threaded</b> <b>gauges</b> are important in controlling threaded joints of parts. There had been built a functional model of the caliber life-cycle. The article shows possible applications of <b>threaded</b> <b>gauges</b> and examines the method of automating the average thread diameter control on a universal three-axis measuring video microscope. The application of this method is expedient in the conditions of modern production, since that usage reduces time expenses and requirements for the operators' qualification, as well as increases the reliability {{of the results of the}} average thread diameter control...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for the calibration of <b>thread</b> <b>gauges</b> on coordinate measuring machines. The procedure involves scanning of thread profiles using a needle-like probe, achieving traceability by substitution of different thread portions with corresponding paths on a calibrated sphere. The feasibility of applying the method to calibrate a parallel <b>thread</b> <b>gauge</b> {{with respect to}} all the relevant thread parameters was demonstrated experimentally using a precision CMM. Application of the comparator approach as described in ISO DTS 15530 - 3 gave measuring uncertainties comparable to the values from usual calibration methods on dedicated equipment, e. g. a measuring uncertainty of 1. 8 mum was achieved for measurement of the pitch, and 2 - 2. 5 mum for diameter measurements...|$|R

40|$|For {{measurement}} of existing thread parameters using profile scanning, system error increases as pitch diameter, {{difference between the}} calibrating thread and measuring thread increases with the single gauge calibration method. There are several alignment deviations affecting the {{measurement of}} pitch diameter. To reduce the system error, a compensation method using two standard <b>thread</b> <b>gauges</b> to calculate the alignment deviations is proposed here. Finally, the theoretical and experimental comparisons between the single gauge calibration method and the proposed method are presented. The results demonstrate that the two gauges calibration method can effectively reduce the system error...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} a novel optical <b>thread</b> plug <b>gauge</b> (OTPG) for internal thread inspection using machine vision. The OTPG {{is composed of}} a rigid industrial endoscope, a charge-coupled device camera, and a two degree-of-freedom motion control unit. A sequence of partial wall images of an internal thread are retrieved and reconstructed into a 2 D unwrapped image. Then, a digital image processing and classification procedure is used to normalize, segment, and determine {{the quality of the}} internal thread. The proposed OTPG provides an orientation-free and convenient method for detecting defects such as scratches, collapses, and flaws in an internal thread. Keywords Internal thread.

50|$|ISO 1502 sets a {{standard}} for <b>threads</b> and <b>gauging</b> to test them. It establishes the attribute T as go for the major diameter and the attribute Z as no-go for the pitch diameter. The inspection tool has two threaded components. For example, there would be two female sections on a gauge to test a threaded male workpiece such as a screw. If the major diameter of a screw is too large, it will not fit in the T test thread at all (fail). If the major diameter is too small, the fit is sloppy (fail). If the thread has been cut too deep, it screws into the Z test thread (fail). If the fit is right and only does about three turns, the fit is right (pass).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{introduction}} of Highly Accelerated Life Testing (HALT) in a multinational corporation as part of a reliability improvement process for printed circuit boards (PCBs). More specifically, the thesis focuses on drafting a standard operating procedure (SOP) to standardize the fixture setup process so as to minimize variation in vibrational responses attributed to fixture setup. This study proposes a three phase approach to meet the objective. The first phase aims to minimize variation in the gauges and the vibration table. A gauge repeatability and reproducibility (gauge R&R) test is conducted on two triaxial accelerometers to determine the most suitable gauge for HALT. Next, a spatial uniformity test is conducted on the vibration table using design of experiments (DOE) method to determine the region with the most consistent vibration levels for testing. The second phase aims to reduce variation in fixture usage by introducing a generic fixture design base on fixture design principles. The last phase involves proposing a short-run statistical process control (SPC) method to detect setup variability. The results from the gauge R&R test show that mechanically mounted accelerometers have the least gauge variance. Using an SOP, switching from wax-mounting to <b>threaded</b> stud-mounting reduces <b>gauge</b> variance by approximately 90 %. However, wax-mounted accelerometers are still relevant for measuring vibrational responses from PCBs due to its non-invasive properties. The drawback will be that the gauge becomes a key contributor to measurement variation. The spatial uniformity test reveals that the center of the vibration table has the least variation and is selected for the fixture setup. Further limitations on the HALT chamber are highlighted. Evaluation on the proposed generic fixture demonstrates that the fixture has met the key design criteria and manage to induce consistent failures to the PCBs. Limitations on the fixture design are also considered. The proposed SPC method is able to detect at least 88 % of the assignable sources of variation in a simulation test. Finally, a custom SOP for the fixture setup is drafted for the company. by Dexter Chew Xuan Han. Thesis: M.
