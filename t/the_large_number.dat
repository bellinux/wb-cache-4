5|$|Ann Arbor has a {{long history}} of {{openness}} to marijuana, given Ann Arbor's decriminalization of cannabis, <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of medical marijuana dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called People's Co-op, was directly across the street from Michigan Stadium until zoning forced it to move one mile to the west), <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual Hash Bash: an event that is held on the first Saturday of April. Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan's medical marijuana law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property, which does not fall under the city's progressive and compassionate ticketing program.|$|E
5|$|During an October5 cabinet meeting, Minister of Education Genji Matsuda {{recommended}} {{schools to}} be built with steel in light of <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of children killed. Reconstruction of the affected areas required an estimated 100,000tons of steel. The National Diet held a special meeting in November to address issues regarding the typhoon's aftermath.|$|E
5|$|For {{those who}} are {{disturbed}} {{by the appearance of}} lentigines, cryosurgery may be beneficial. Due to <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of lentigines this may prove time consuming. An alternative treatment with tretinoin or hydroquinone creams may help.|$|E

Israel is the foreign country with <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>number</b> of nominations (10) without winning an award, while Portugal has <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>number</b> of submissions (30) without a nomination.|$|R
50|$|The {{percentages}} of never-married men (52.6%) and women (38.6%) {{were among the}} county's highest. Both statistics are likely due to <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> of LGBT {{members of the community}} and <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> of young hipsters.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of people killed during this time, over 100,000people {{were forced to}} evacuate. The eruption of the Santa Ana Volcano on October 1 contributed to the destruction in Central America {{as a result of}} the floods and mudslides caused.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} the categories which own <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>number</b> of Facebook pages {{as well as the}} Romanian Facebook pages which have <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>number</b> of fans. Another aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the categories generating <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>number</b> of fans on their official Facebook pages, the increase of the number of fans in the last month and the Facebook pages generating the biggest feedback among their fans. The data was collected by using Social Media analysis sites, such as www. socialbakers. com and www. facebrands. ro. The study sample comprises 20 Facebook pages with <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>number</b> of fans...|$|R

5|$|The Victoria Cross {{has been}} awarded 1,358 times to 1,355 {{individual}} recipients. <b>The</b> <b>largest</b> <b>number</b> of recipients for one campaign is the First World War, for which 628 medals were awarded to 627 recipients. <b>The</b> <b>largest</b> <b>number</b> awarded for actions on a single day was 24 on 16 November 1857, at the Second Relief of Lucknow, during the Indian Mutiny. <b>The</b> <b>largest</b> <b>number</b> awarded for a single action was 18, for the assault on Sikandar Bagh, during the Second Relief of Lucknow. <b>The</b> <b>largest</b> <b>number</b> awarded to one unit during a single action was 7, to the 2nd/24th Foot, for the defence of Rorke's Drift (22–23 January 1879), during the Zulu War.|$|R
5|$|Poet and {{translator}} Peter McMillan says <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of Narihira's poems {{included in}} the Kokinshū and later court anthologies is {{an indicator of the}} high regard in which his poetry was held.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} {{continued}} to Antwerp. Some 12–30 German fighters attacked the airfield from 09:25 to 09:40. The ground defences were alert and the German formations attacked in a disorganised manner. 145 Wing RAF was missed completely and considering <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of targets the destruction was light; just 12 Spitfires were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a wealth}} of Iron Age burial sites in Hertfordshire, making it a place of {{international}} importance in Iron Age study. <b>The</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of sites of all types indicates dense and complex settlement patterns immediately prior to the Roman invasion.|$|E

50|$|Nottale {{noticed that}} {{reasoning}} about scales was a promising road to explain <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> hypothesis. This was elaborated in more details in a working paper. The scale-relativistic {{way to explain}} <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> hypothesis was later discussed by Nottale and by Sidharth.|$|R

5|$|According to Transport for London (TfL), {{the station}} is at {{capacity}} because of <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of passengers leaving and entering the station, {{as well as the}} large numbers of passengers changing between lines. Currently, everyone who uses the station has to pass through the intermediate concourse {{at the bottom of the}} main escalators. This causes congestion and delays.|$|E
5|$|According to the Nice model, {{after the}} {{formation}} of the Solar System, the orbits of all the giant planets continued to change slowly, influenced by their interaction with <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of remaining planetesimals. After 500–600million years (about 4billion years ago) Jupiter and Saturn fell into a 2:1 resonance: Saturn orbited the Sun once for every two Jupiter orbits. This resonance created a gravitational push against the outer planets, possibly causing Neptune to surge past Uranus and plough into the ancient Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the higher Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike receives fewer visitors. When climbing from the west many people traverse the western slopes on their way to Helvellyn. Despite this the summit does still receive a large number of walkers, who use a large number of footpaths. <b>The</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of footpaths causes significant disturbance to the summit vegetation, which could be greatly reduced by using fewer footpaths.|$|E
50|$|Population {{reviews of}} each electoral {{district}} are conducted before each general election, {{which can lead}} to certain districts being granted a smaller or greater number of parliamentary seats.

5|$|Before {{the discoveries}} of the Voyager missions, Jupiter's moons were {{arranged}} neatly into four groups of four, based on commonality of their orbital elements. Since then, <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of new small outer moons has complicated this picture. There are now {{thought to be}} six main groups, although some are more distinct than others.|$|E
5|$|Bob {{finds the}} action and higher pay rejuvenating; he begins {{rigorous}} training while awaiting more work from Mirage {{for the next two}} months. Discovering a tear in his suit, he visits superhero costume designer Edna Mode. Mode, assuming that Helen knows what Bob is doing, makes new suits for the entire family. However, she rejects Bob's request for a cape, citing <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of Supers who perished when their capes got caught in something.|$|E
5|$|Brussels' hosting of {{institutions}} {{has made it}} a major centre for the EU. Together with NATO it has attracted more journalists and ambassadors than Washington D.C. However the three-city agreement has been criticised, notably concerning the Parliament due to <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of people that move between the cities. The European Green Party estimated that the arrangement costs 200million euro and 20,268 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Brussels is preferred by some due {{to the presence of}} other institutions and other groups whereas Strasbourg is supported due to its historical importance to European unity.|$|E

5|$|Conditions {{in camps}} varied {{considerably}} geographically and over time. Conditions were particularly {{poor in the}} summer of 1940, when facilities proved insufficient to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of new POWs, and in the particularly cold winter that same year. Gradually, as prisoners were repatriated, relieving overcrowding, conditions generally improved. From 1943, however, as the war on the Eastern Front turned against Germany, conditions worsened and the food supply became more precarious. Some camps were purpose-built, like Stalag II-D, but others could be former barracks, asylums or fortresses.|$|E
5|$|D'Avalos, having {{waited for}} the arrival {{a large body of}} landsknechts {{dispatched}} by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, set off from Asti towards Carignano. His total force included 12,500–18,000 infantry, of which perhaps 4,000 were arquebusiers or musketeers; he was only able to gather about 800–1,000 cavalry, of which less than 200 were gendarmes. D'Avalos recognized the relative weakness of his cavalry, but considered it to be compensated by the experience of his infantry and <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of arquebusiers in its ranks.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, {{the seat}} of the European Parliament remains controversial. The work of Parliament is divided between Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, which is seen as a problem due to <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of MEPs, staff, and {{documents}} which need to be moved. As the locations of the major seats have been enshrined in the treaties of the European Union, Parliament has no right to decide its own seat, unlike other national parliaments.|$|E
