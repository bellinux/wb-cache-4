5|$|After Bardulf's death, a {{legal case}} was brought against Bardulf's {{chaplain}} and constable, alleging that Bardulf had allowed his two servants {{to hear a}} case <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been heard by the justice. The litigants charged that the two servants had wrongly decided the case, and after hearing the allegations, the royal justices at Westminster agreed and restored the disputed property to the litigants.|$|E
5|$|During this episode, {{the dogs}} had to {{interact}} with the main characters, which proved difficult. Actor Sean Bean reported that for the final scene where he has to sacrifice Lady, the animal was too scared to remain still. They had to keep rehearsing the scene until the dog felt comfortable, making a shot <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> taken a few minutes about three hours long.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the Hurricane Protection Project of New Orleans has {{prompted}} many government officials to call for many congressional committee hearings and investigations. The group Levees.org led by Sandy Rosenthal called for 8/29 Commission to investigate both the engineering and decision-making behind {{the collapse of a}} flood protection system <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> held against Katrina's storm surge.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, Ishiba reiterated <b>that</b> Japan <b>should</b> <b>have</b> the {{capability}} to build nuclear weapons, stating <b>that</b> “Japan <b>should</b> <b>have</b> the technology {{to build a nuclear}} weapon if it wants to do so”.|$|R

5|$|The {{reason for}} the attack is unknown, with {{theories}} that Centaur was in breach of the international conventions <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> protected her, that I-177s commander was unaware that Centaur was a hospital ship, or that the submarine commander knowingly attacked a protected vessel. The wreck of Centaur was found on 20 December 2009; a claimed discovery in 1995 had been {{proven to be a}} different shipwreck.|$|E
5|$|In Mississippi Republican Executive Opinion v. Brooks (1984), the Supreme Court summarily affirmed, {{without a}} written opinion, a lower court's {{decision}} that 1982 amendment to Section 2 is constitutional. Justice Rehnquist, joined by Chief Justice Burger, dissented from the opinion. Their reasoning {{was that the}} case presented complex constitutional issues <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> warranted a full hearing. In later cases, the Supreme Court {{is more likely to}} disregard one of its previous judgments that lacks a written opinion, but lower courts must respect the Supreme Court's unwritten summary affirmances as being as equally binding on them as Supreme Court judgments with written opinions. Partially due to Brooks, the constitutionality of the Section 2 results test has since been unanimously upheld by lower courts.|$|E
5|$|Later, Gladwell compares Langan with Oppenheimer, {{the father}} of the atomic bomb. Noting that they typify innate natural {{abilities}} <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> helped them both succeed in life, Gladwell argues that Oppenheimer's upbringing made a pivotal difference in his life. Oppenheimer grew up in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Manhattan, {{was the son of a}} successful businessman and a painter, attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School on Central Park West, and was afforded a childhood of concerted cultivation. Outliers argues that these opportunities gave Oppenheimer the chance to develop the practical intelligence necessary for success. Gladwell then provides an anecdote: When Oppenheimer was a student at University of Cambridge he attempted to poison one of his tutors. He avoided punishment, and continued his studies by using the skills gained from his cultivated upbringing in his negotiation with the university's administrators, who had wanted to expel him.|$|E

5|$|On 6 May 1910, Edward VII died. Mary's husband {{ascended the}} throne as King George V, {{and she became}} queen consort. When her husband asked her to drop one of her two {{official}} names, Victoria Mary, she chose to be called Mary, preferring {{not to take the}} name of her husband's grandmother, Queen Victoria. Queen Mary was crowned with the King on 22 June 1911 at Westminster Abbey. Later in the year, the new King and Queen travelled to India for the Delhi Durbar held on 12 December 1911, and toured the sub-continent as Emperor and Empress of India, returning to Britain in February. The beginning of Mary's period as consort brought her into conflict with her mother-in-law, Queen Alexandra. Although the two were on friendly terms, Alexandra could be stubborn; she demanded precedence over Mary at the funeral of Edward VII, was slow in leaving Buckingham Palace, and kept some of the royal jewels <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been passed to the new Queen.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939, Bessie left her union post and joined G Division of the Liverpool Ambulance Service, as a driver. Initially her main job was to train other drivers, mostly young women. She became a section leader and then a deputy leader of G Division, an administrative post <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> kept her at headquarters. However, she records that she drove her ambulance through all the 68 major air raids that struck Liverpool during the war years. It was dangerous work; on a single day, 3May 1941, 14 drivers lost their lives. Bessie remained with the ambulance service almost {{until the end of}} the war in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Initial police {{speculation}} {{was that}} Kinne had bribed guards {{to look the}} other way while she escaped the prison—an unusual blackout had been reported at the prison on the evening of and at the approximate time of her escape, and investigation showed that a door <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been locked had been left unsecured—but further questioning of prison guards and administration showed that oversight at the prison was generally lax and that it was staffed by fewer guards than it should have been. News reports of the time reported numerous theories about Kinne's escape, including that she had bribed prison guards, that she may have enlisted the help of a supposed boyfriend who was a Mexico City policeman, that Kinne's mother had been involved in the escape plan, that a former Mexican secret service agent had assisted in her escape, and that Kinne may have disguised herself as a man to effect her escape. A more modern theory speculates that the family of Francisco Parades Ordoñez had helped her escape and then killed her.|$|E

60|$|It was unfortunate {{for them}} both <b>that</b> he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> switch in his hand at such a time, but more unfortunate still was it <b>that</b> Fletcher <b>should</b> <b>have</b> had a pistol in his belt. The Scot dropped the bridle at last; dropped it to pluck forth the weapon.|$|R
60|$|Neale felt <b>that</b> this {{proposition}} <b>should</b> <b>have</b> put another {{light on the}} question, <b>that</b> it <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been received appreciatively if not enthusiastically. But he was somewhat {{taken aback by the}} fact that it was not.|$|R
5|$|The {{substance}} Rhoca-Gil {{was used}} to fix the leakages, but the substance failed to work properly. Not only did it fail to polymerize and stop the leaks, it also contaminated the surroundings with acrylamide. The entire process of fixing the leak and cleaning up the toxicity delayed {{the process of building}} the tunnel by one year; and it was first opened on 22 August 1999. Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during incidents <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been addressed in 1995, and were never taken seriously. About sixty houses received damage due to the construction of the tunnel. An evaluation performed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was used on fixing the leaks; however, the report claimed this was, to a large extent, a waste of money due to inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the entire construction of the railway.|$|E

25|$|The presidential {{elections}} <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been organized in 2005 were postponed until November 2010.

25|$|The {{contribution}} from the integral term {{is proportional to}} both {{the magnitude of the}} error and the duration of the error. The integral in a PID controller is the sum of the instantaneous error over time and gives the accumulated offset <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been corrected previously. The accumulated error is then multiplied by the integral gain (Ki) and added to the controller output.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of ASFA {{argued that}} the real reason {{children}} languished in foster care was that too many were taken needlessly from their parents in the first place. Since ASFA did not address this, opponents said, it would not accomplish its goals, and would only slow {{a decline in the}} foster care population <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> occurred anyway because of a decline in reported child abuse.|$|E
25|$|Offensively, {{this play}} {{demonstrates}} how {{both types of}} passes can divide and stretch a defence. Jairzinho's running and cross {{was set up by}} an excellent forward pass, and his centre to Pelé capped a move <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> resulted in a goal, {{were it not for the}} extraordinary skill of English keeper, Gordon Banks. Offside traps are one way to defend against both pass types, but the ultimate solution is defensive depth and sound goalkeeping.|$|E

Hudson said <b>that</b> Nifong <b>should</b> <b>have</b> resigned immediately, saying that defense attorneys could challenge Nifong's authority. Easley, a former prosecutor and state attorney general, also felt <b>that</b> Nifong <b>should</b> <b>have</b> resigned immediately.|$|R
60|$|Considering, {{however, the}} declamatory {{nature of the}} French dialogue, and the {{peremptory}} rule of their drama, that love, or rather gallantry, must be the moving principle of every performance, it is more astonishing <b>that</b> Corneille <b>should</b> <b>have</b> chosen so masculine and agitating a subject, than <b>that</b> he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> failed in treating it with propriety or success.|$|R
