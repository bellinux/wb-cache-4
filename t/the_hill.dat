5|$|On June 2, C Company {{moved to}} capture Hill 543 {{near the village}} of Chipo-ri. <b>The</b> <b>hill</b> was {{protected}} by heavily entrenched Chinese infantry as well as mortars at the top of <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> During their first attempt to advance up <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> the company took heavy casualties, and the 3rd Platoon leader was mortally wounded. Charlton took command of the platoon and reorganized it for another attack. Heavy fire eventually forced the company back down <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{about two}} hours, Marines reached and climbed Hill 148. Working from the top, the Marines began {{clearing}} the Japanese fighting positions on <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> {{most of which}} still remained, with explosive charges, grenades, and hand-to-hand combat. From the top of <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> the Marines were also able to put increased suppressive fire on Tanambogo. The Marine battalion commander on Gavutu radioed General Rupertus with a request for reinforcements before attempting to assault Tanambogo.|$|E
5|$|At 02:45, the Chinese began a {{sixth and}} final attack {{with a heavy}} mortar barrage which inflicted heavy {{casualties}} on the remaining Rangers, including Cummings, who was killed instantly by a mortar shell and Puckett, who was severely wounded. The Chinese then sent a reinforced battalion of 600 infantry at <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> while simultaneously striking other elements of Task Force Dolvin, preventing artillery from providing effective support. Without artillery support of their own, and low on ammunition, they were overwhelmed by the subsequent Chinese attack. The Chinese forces swarmed <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> in overwhelming numbers, {{and many of the}} Rangers were shot and killed in their foxholes or stabbed with bayonets. The company was destroyed in the fighting, with the survivors retreating from <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> Three Rangers later chased away Chinese troops as they tried to capture the severely wounded Puckett. The remaining Rangers gathered at an assembly area at the base of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> under First Sergeant Charles L. Pitts, the highest ranking unwounded member of the company, and withdrew. The Rangers suffered over 80 percent casualties on Hill 205; of the 51 who captured <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> 10 were killed or missing and another 31 wounded.|$|E

5|$|Jump {{distance}} is measured {{from the edge}} of the table to the placement of landing by increments of 0.5m. This is done using electronic and video monitoring systems together with event personnel assigned to observe jumps by the side of <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> known as 'distance measurers'. If enough jumps are deemed to be too far beyond <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> size, or near the 'fall line' as determined by the jury – the zone where the slope begins to flatten out – an immediate meeting is held between the jury and race director, which usually results in the start gate being lowered so as to check inrun speeds and therefore distances. For spectators and judges, increments of 5m are clearly indicated by rows of fir across the hill; a painted red line is used for the K-point, and a dashed red line for <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> size. Both sides of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> are also marked highly visible in red to indicate the 'landing zone', while the point beyond <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> size is marked in green on the sides.|$|E
5|$|Mel learns {{from her}} spy Azmus that {{northern}} mercenaries {{have been seen}} near the border – allies of the Marquise of Merindar – and that other allied forces are planning on eradicating <b>the</b> <b>Hill</b> Folk to take their colorwoods for payment. Mel sends Azmus to tell Shevraeth and rides out to warn <b>the</b> <b>Hill</b> Folk, but is shocked to encounter Shevraeth already on the road. Initially, he assumes she is plotting with Merindar against him, but lets her go when she tells him about the plans against <b>the</b> <b>Hill</b> Folk. An outnumbered Mel bravely tries to stop a group of mercenaries marching towards nearby forests, and is only saved by forces sent by Shevraeth. <b>The</b> <b>Hill</b> Folk now safe, Mel returns to Shevraeth, where she learns that he successfully put down Merindar's revolt. She also learns {{that he has been}} her secret admirer. After finally calling him by his first name, Vidanric, they kiss. The two return to Remalna-city, and find that Flauvic has secretly bewitched the entire capitol. As Flauvic prepares to complete his victory, <b>the</b> <b>Hill</b> Folk come to Mel's rescue and turn him into a tree. With the realm now secure, Shevraeth and Mel marry and are crowned as king and queen.|$|E
5|$|Monte Testaccio {{also had}} a {{religious}} significance; it was formerly used on Good Friday to represent <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> of Golgotha in Jerusalem, when the Pope would lead a procession to the summit and placed crosses to represent those of Jesus and the two thieves crucified alongside him. Monte Testaccio is still crowned with a cross in commemoration of the event. It was not until after World War II that the area around <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> was redeveloped as a working class neighbourhood.|$|E

5|$|Skilful use of {{headwind}} {{and thermal}} updrafts along various sections of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> {{is used to}} generate additional lift, creating pressure under the oversized skis and enabling athletes to effectively ride on a 'cushion of air'. A reasonable amount of headwind is favourable to a long jump as it {{has the effect of}} keeping the athlete aloft and delaying their descent back onto <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> whereas a tailwind or no wind at all is highly unfavourable and tends to shorten a jump by pushing the athlete downwards towards <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> too early. In particular, the presence of a tailwind forms one of the most challenging aspects of clearing the knoll and achieving a competitive distance. A crosswind is just as challenging, as it can create dangerous instability in the air. Conversely, in ideal headwind conditions, an athlete can 'catch' an updraft along various points of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> – which always involves some degree of luck – and use it to glide even further, making for an impressive visual effect for audiences.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{air strike}} and {{artillery}} bombardment pushed North Korean forces off <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> After the strike, at 15:30, the infantry attacked up <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> unopposed and secured it by 16:30. The combined strength of E and F Companies on <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> was about 60 men. The artillery {{and the air}} strike killed and wounded an estimated 500 enemy troops on Hill 303, with survivors fleeing in complete disorder. Two of the massacre survivors making their way down <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> to meet the counterattacking force were fired upon before they could establish their identity, but not hit.

5|$|The {{division}} continued patrol activity around Old Baldy Hill and Pork Chop Hill into 1953, digging {{tunnels and}} building a network of outposts and bunkers on and around <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> In April, the North Korean Army began stepping up offensive operations against UN forces. During the Battle of Porkchop Hill, the Chinese 67th and 141st divisions overran Pork Chop Hill using massed infantry and artillery fire. <b>The</b> <b>hill</b> had been {{under the control of}} the 31st Infantry. The 31st counterattacked with reinforcements from the 17th Infantry and recaptured the area the next day. On 6 July the North Koreans and Chinese launched a determined attack against Pork Chop resulting in five days of fierce fighting with few meaningful results. By the end of July, five infantry battalions from the 31st and 17th were defending <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> while a Chinese division was in position to attack it. During this standoff, the UN ordered the 7th Infantry Division to retreat from <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> in preparation for an armistice, which would end major hostilities.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>hill</b> {{stands at}} a {{strategic}} location overlooking {{the point where the}} River Tone and the old course of the River Cary join the River Parrett. Although there is some evidence of Roman visitation, the first fortification of the site was the construction of a Norman motte. It has been called King Alfred's Fort, however there is no proof of use by Alfred the Great. A medieval church was built on <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> in the 15th century. The current ruined church on top of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> was built in 1793. The land and ruin were donated to the National Trust in 1946 as a war memorial.|$|E
5|$|The most {{challenging}} {{stage of the}} takeoff is carrying the speed from the inrun with sufficient height over the 'knoll', and achieving the correct trajectory down <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> The knoll is the highest point of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> itself, from which it begins to slope downwards. On modern ski flying hills the table is placed considerably far back from the knoll, so as to reduce the steepness of the flight curve. A skilled athlete is able to aggressively 'snap' into the transition so as to clear the knoll with ease, thereby allowing them to focus completely on using their specialised aerodynamic flying technique to maximise distance further down <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> Athletes of the highest skill level can consistently compensate for any lack of inrun speed with perfect timing {{off the table and}} an excellent transition.|$|E
