5|$|Henry {{joined the}} revolt of Edward's wife Isabella of France and her lover Mortimer in 1326, {{pursuing}} and capturing Edward at Neath in South Wales. Following Edward's deposition at the Parliament of Kenilworth in 1326 and reputed murder at Berkeley Castle, Thomas's conviction was posthumously reversed and Henry regained {{possession of the}} Earldoms of Lancaster, Derby, Salisbury and Lincoln that had been forfeit for Thomas's treason. His restored prestige led to him knighting the young King Edward III of England before his coronation. Mortimer lost support over the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton that formalised Scotland's independence, and his developing power in the Welsh Marches provoked jealousy from the barons. When Mortimer called a parliament to make his new powers and estates permanent with the title of Earl of March in 1328, Henry led the opposition and held a counter-meeting. In response, Mortimer ravaged the lands of Lancaster and checked the revolt. Edward III was able to assume control in 1330 but Henry's further influence was restricted by poor health and blindness for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>years</b> of his life.|$|E

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{assessment of}} the animal’s requirements is of utmost importance for a balanced nutrition of farm animals. In this review we describe the results {{from a series of}} experiments, performed during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> years by our research group, aiming at assessing the utilization of dietary protein by the Iberian pig throughout the different stages of its productive cycle. Nutritional doseresponse studies involving several isoenergetic treatments differing in proteinconcentration -all with similar aminoacid profile following the ideal proteinconcept- along with comparative growth and metabolic studies with conventional breeds have been performed. Our observations reveal that the capacity of this breed for protein accretion is rather limited compared to that of conventional or lean breeds at similar stages of growth. They also suggest the need for reducing the concentration of protein in the diet of the Iberian pig to comply with the metabolic profile of this native pig breed. We summarise all the information gathered during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>year</b> sand provide recommendations on the level and composition of dietary protein in the diet for pure breed animals during the different phases of growth. An adequate nutritional management, particularly dietary protein provision, improves the efficiency of utilization of dietary protein and results in relevant economic, environmental and animal welfare benefits...|$|R

25|$|Much about Canadian {{federalism}} has undoubtedly {{changed in}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>years,</b> {{although it is}} also true that much remains the same. The foundations of Canadian federalism were laid at the Quebec Conference of 1864. The Quebec Resolutions were a compromise between those who wanted sovereignty vested in the federal government and those who wanted it vested in the provinces. The compromise based the federation on the constitution of the British Empire, under which the legal sovereignty of imperial power was modified by the conventions of colonial responsible government, making colonies of settlement (such as those of British North America) self-governing in domestic affairs. A protracted political process ensued before the Quebec Resolutions became the British North America Act of 1867. This process was dominated by John A. Macdonald, who joined British officials in attempting to make the federation more centralized than that envisaged by the Resolutions.|$|E

Although called annals, these are closer to narrative history and are derived {{from a number of}} sources. The basic framework is from the Chronicle of Ireland, but to this has been added a variety of material whose source is unknown, perhaps including early sagas, which concerns Cerball. The Fragmentary Annals were intended to magnify Cerball's achievements, and to present his dealings with Vikings and Norse–Gaels in a favourable light.|$|E
