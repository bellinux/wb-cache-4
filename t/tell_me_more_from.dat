They spend {{a significant amount of}} time sifting through documents and finding new information such as facts, opinions or stakeholders (i. e. people, places and organizations that have a stake in the news). Spotting them is a tedious and cognitively intense process. One task, essential to this process, is to find and keep track of stakeholders. This task is taxing cognitively and in terms of memory. <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> offers an automatic aid to this task. <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> is a system that, given a seed story, mines the web for similar stories reported by different sources and selects only those stories which offer new information with respect to that original seed story. Much like a journalist, the task of detecting named entities is central to its success. In this paper we briefly describe <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> and, in particular, we focus on <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More’s</b> entity detection component. We describe an approach that combines off-the-shelf named entity recognizers (NERs) with WPED, a publicly available NER that uses Wikipedia as its knowledge base. We show significant increase in precision scores with respect to traditional NERs. Lastly, we present an overall evaluation of <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> using this approach...|$|R
