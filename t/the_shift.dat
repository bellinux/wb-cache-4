40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the control {{strategy}} of shifting time involving multigroup clutches for a hydromechanical continuously variable transmission (HMCVT). The dynamic analyses of mathematical models are presented in this paper, and the simulation models are used to study the control strategy of HMCVT. Simulations are performed in Simulation X platform to investigate <b>the</b> <b>shifting</b> time of clutches under different operating conditions. On this basis, simulation analysis and test verification of two typical conditions, which play the decisive roles for <b>the</b> <b>shifting</b> quality, are carried out. The results show that {{there are differences in}} <b>the</b> <b>shifting</b> time of <b>the</b> two typical conditions. In <b>the</b> <b>shifting</b> process from <b>the</b> negative transmission of hydromechanical ranges to the positive transmission of hydromechanical ranges, the control strategy based on <b>the</b> <b>shifting</b> time is switching <b>the</b> clutches of <b>shifting</b> mechanism firstly and then disengaging a group of clutches of planetary gear mechanism and engaging another group of the clutches of planetary gear mechanism lastly.

5|$|The state's {{conservative}} {{white voters}} began to support Republican presidential candidates by the mid-20th century.

5|$|Another {{brute force}} {{approach}} is to match up the frequency distribution of the letters. By graphing the frequencies of letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot the value of <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> {{by looking at the}} displacement of particular features of the graph. This is known as frequency analysis. For example, in the English language the plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive. Computers can also do this by measuring how well the actual frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.|$|E

As a result, strikes to vital points by tori, entering (irimi) and initiation of techniques by tori, the distinction between omote (front side) and ura (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners feel that lack of training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness.|$|E

5|$|Another {{development}} {{that lead to}} <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> to modern globalization was {{the development of a}} more politicized system. Proto-globalization period marked a steady expansion of larger states from the Indonesian islands to northern Scandinava. The settlement of these individuals made it easier for governments to tax, develop an army, labor force, and create a sustainable economy. The development and streamlining of these cultural aspects lead to an increase in peripheral players in the game of globalization. The stable legal institutions developed in the late proto-globalization and early modern globalization period established economic advances, intellectual property rights (more predominantly in England), general geographical stability, and generational societal improvement.|$|E

5|$|Evidence of {{abstract}} thinking {{can be seen}} in the archaeological record as early as the Acheulean-Middle Stone Age transition, approximately 300,000-250,000 years ago. This transition involves a shift in stone tool technology from Mode 2, Acheulean tools, to Mode 3 and 4, which include blades and microliths. The manufacture of these tools requires planning and the understanding of how striking a stone will produce different flaking patterns. This requires abstract thought, one of the hallmarks of modern human behavior. <b>The</b> <b>shift</b> from large cutting tools in the Acheulian to smaller and more diversified toolkits in the MSA represents a better cognitive and conceptual understanding of flintknapping, as well as the potential functional effects of distinct tool types.|$|E
