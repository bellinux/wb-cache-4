Fellow voice actor Tom Kenny found it amusing, leading to Lawrence's decision to use it when auditioning for roles on SpongeBob. Lawrence initially tried out for the role of SpongeBob during the series' pre-production, but Stephen Hillenburg wanted a more innocent voice for the character and turned him down. Lawrence continued to work on the show, voicing minor characters, eventually leading to him being offered the role of Plankton for the [...] "Plankton!" [...] episode.

This small book contains three chapters, each of which {{he claimed to have}} written in exactly one hour, beginning at noon, on April 8, April 9, and April 10, 1904. Crowley claims that he took dictation from an entity named Aiwass, whom he later identified as his own Holy Guardian Angel.

500|$|The strongest {{element of}} style noted by critics and reviewers is Lee's talent for narration, which {{in an early}} review in Time was called [...] "tactile brilliance". Writing a decade later, another scholar noted, [...] "Harper Lee has a {{remarkable}} gift of story-telling. Her art is visual, and with cinematographic fluidity and subtlety we see a scene melting into another scene without jolts of transition." [...] Lee combines the narrator's voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown woman's reflecting on her childhood, using the ambiguity of <b>this</b> <b>voice</b> combined with the narrative technique of flashback to play intricately with perspectives. This narrative method allows Lee to tell a [...] "delightfully deceptive" [...] story that mixes the simplicity of childhood observation with adult situations complicated by hidden motivations and unquestioned tradition. However, at times the blending causes reviewers to question Scout's preternatural vocabulary and depth of understanding. Both Harding LeMay and the novelist and literary critic Granville Hicks expressed doubt that children as sheltered as Scout and Jem could understand the complexities and horrors involved in the trial for Tom Robinson's life.|$|E

500|$|Clarke's {{style has}} {{frequently}} {{been described as}} a pastiche, particularly of nineteenth-century British writers such as Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and George Meredith. Specifically, the novel's minor characters, including sycophants, rakes, and the Duke of Wellington, evoke Dickens' caricatures. Laura Miller, in her review for Salon, suggests that the novel is [...] "about a certain literary voice, the eminently civilized voice of early 19th century social comedy", exemplified by the works of Austen. The novel even uses obsolete spellings—chuse for choose and shewed for showed, for example—to convey <b>this</b> <b>voice</b> as well as the free indirect speech made famous by Austen. Clarke herself notes that Austen's influence is particularly strong in the [...] "domestic scenes, set in living rooms and drawing rooms where people mostly chat about magic" [...] where Dickens's is prominent [...] "any time there's more action or description". While many reviewers compare Clarke's style to that of Austen, Gregory Feeley argues in his review for The Weekly Standard that [...] "the points of resemblance are mostly superficial". He writes that [...] "Austen gets down to business briskly, while Clarke engages in a curious narrative strategy of continual deferral and delay." [...] For example, Clarke mentions Jonathan Strange on the first page of the novel, but only in a footnote. He reappears in other footnotes throughout the opening but does not appear as a character in the text proper until a quarter of the way through the novel.|$|E
500|$|When {{production}} first started, Clement and {{his crew}} would spend six hours applying Haley's make-up; eventually, the crew was able to streamline their process. According to Haley, the make-up crew would apply individual prosthetics to him, from his head {{all the way down}} his back, which were glued to his body. The appliances were then blended together to create a seamless appearance. Haley spent approximately three hours and twenty minutes in the make-up chair to apply the prosthetics, each day; on occasion, it would take almost four and a half hours when the crew needed to apply the prosthetic skull cap, which Haley did not need to worry about most days as he was able to wear the fedora hat on top of his head. Haley also had to wear contact lenses, one that was bloody and another that was cloudy, with the latter one making it difficult for the actor to see out of. Haley also had to work on developing Freddy's [...] "voice" [...] for the film. According to Haley, the process of coming up with the perfect voice for Freddy is [...] "this organic process of embodying the character", and not about just [...] "sitting around the table and going, 'Let me try <b>this</b> <b>voice</b> and this voice'". Haley and Bayer admitted that some of the voice would be digitally enhanced in the end to give it a [...] "supernatural quality" [...] and get it away from the voice Haley used as Rorschach in Watchmen.|$|E
500|$|Following [...] "The Puppy Episode", Ellen was renewed {{for another}} season. ABC prefaced each episode of season five with a parental {{advisory}} warning. DeGeneres strongly criticized ABC for including the warnings, saying {{in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "It was like <b>this</b> <b>voice</b> like you're entering some kind of radiation center. It was very offensive, and you don't think that's going to affect ratings?" [...] DeGeneres further noted demonstrable hypocrisy on the part of ABC, citing episodes of ABC series The Drew Carey Show and Spin City which included two men kissing (the Carey episode was even promoted using the kiss). [...] "There's no disclaimer on [...] at all, because it's two heterosexual men, and they're making fun of heterosexuality... because neither (Michael J. Fox nor Michael Boatman) is really gay in real life." [...] Episodes after [...] "The Puppy Episode" [...] dealt with Ellen's coming out to her parents and boss, quitting her job at the bookstore and finding a series of new jobs. Other episodes dealt with her search for a romantic partner and learning more about the LGBT community. Even some gay people began criticizing the amount of gay content in the series, including Chaz Bono, formerly known as Chastity Bono, who was at the time working for GLAAD. Bono was quoted as saying, [...] " [...] is so gay it's excluding a large part of our society. A lot of the stuff on it is somewhat of an inside joke. It's one thing to have a gay lead character, but it's another when every episode deals with specific gay issues." [...] Bono would later say that the comments were taken out of context. Ellen was canceled after its fifth season.|$|E
25|$|Scriabin's early {{harmonic}} {{language was}} specially {{fond of the}} thirteenth dominant chord, usually with the 7th, 3rd, and 13th spelled in fourths. <b>This</b> <b>voicing</b> {{can also be seen}} in several of Chopin's works. According to Peter Sabbagh, <b>this</b> <b>voicing</b> would be the main generating source of the later Mystic chord. More importantly, Scriabin was fond of simultaneously combining two or more of the different dominant seventh enhancings, like 9ths, altered 5ths, and raised 11ths. However, despite these tendencies, slightly more dissonant than usual for the time, all these dominant chords were treated according to the traditional rules: the added tones resolved to the corresponding adjacent notes, and the whole chord was treated as a dominant, fitting inside tonality and diatonic, functional harmony.|$|R

[...] For instance, in the episode [...] "House Fancy", television personality Alton Brown guest starred as the character of Nicholas Whithers, the host and judge of a show of the same name. In an interview, Brown described the work as [...] "a blast." [...] He said [...] "I came up with <b>this</b> <b>voice</b> that didn't sound anything like me. I channeled this very strange person. Only three people I know figured out it was even me when they saw it." [...] Actor and musician Johnny Depp guest starred in the episode [...] "SpongeBob vs. The Big One" [...] {{as the voice of}} Jack Kahuna Laguna, a surf guru that taught SpongeBob how to surf. According to Sarah Noonan, vice president of talent and casting for Nickelodeon, Depp accepted the role because he and his kids are fans of the show. The episode was also guest starred by musician and The Monkees' Davy Jones who starred in the episode as himself, appearing {{at the bottom of the}} sea with his locker, and Bruce Brown providing vocal cameo as the episode's narrator. Brian Doyle-Murray also reprised his role as the Flying Dutchman for the episode. In [...] "The Card", Ernest Borgnine returned, reprising his role as Mermaid Man. Borgnine later reappeared in the episodes [...] "Ditchin'" [...] and [...] "Shuffleboarding", voicing his recurring role, with Tim Conway as Barnacle Boy. In [...] "Dear Vikings", English actor Ian McShane voiced Gordon, the leader of the large group of Vikings outside of Bikini Bottom. Dennis Quaid also appeared in the [...] "Grandpappy the Pirate" [...] as Grandpa Redbeard, Mr. Krabs' grandfather. Furthermore, Dee Snider, the frontman of the heavy metal band Twisted Sister, guest starred in [...] "Shell Shocked" [...] as Angry Jack. Snider said [...] "I knew they must be fans [...] because in the SpongeBob movie, they took my song 'I Wanna Rock' and changed it to 'Goofy Goober Rock.' I flipped at the opportunity to be in the show. I have four kids, and everybody loved SpongeBob." [...] In the entry [...] "The Clash of Triton", English singer Victoria Beckham guest starred in the episode as the wife of King Neptune, Queen Amphitrite. The writers created the role of a Queen Amphitrite especially for Beckham. The former Spice Girl accepted the role because her sons, Brooklyn, Romeo, and Cruz, love the show, were excited when their mother told them of the role, and looked forward to watching the episode with her. Beckham recorded the voice-over in late-2008 in a day, and claimed that she was [...] "thrilled" [...] to provide the vocal cameo. Other guests in the episode included Seinfeld actor John O'Hurley as King Neptune and Skid Row heavy metal vocalist Sebastian Bach as the voice of Triton.|$|E
2500|$|Description: The Italian {{version of}} this fach is the spinto, which {{literally}} translated means pushed. However this is not accurate in terms of these singers' vocal production.
