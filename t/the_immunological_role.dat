5000|$|There is however, a {{twist in}} <b>the</b> <b>immunological</b> <b>role</b> of HSP60. As {{mentioned}} above, {{there are two}} different types of HSP60 proteins, bacterial as well as mammalian. Since they are very similar in sequence, bacterial HSP60 wouldn’t be expected to cause a large immune response in humans. The immune system is “designed to ignore ‘self’, that is, host constituents; however, paradoxically, {{this is not the case}} with chaperonins”. It has been found that many anti-chaperonin antibodies exist and are associated with many autoimmune diseases. According to Ranford, et al. experiments have been performed which have shown that antibodies which are “generated by a human host after exposure to bacterial chaperonin 60 proteins” can cross-react with human chaperonin 60 proteins. [...] Bacterial HSP60 is causing the immune system to create anti-chaperonin antibodies, even though bacterial and human HSP60 have similar protein sequences. These new antibodies are then recognizing and attacking human HSP60 which causes an autoimmune disease. This suggests that HSP60 may play a role in autoimmunity, however more research needs to be done in order to discover more completely its role in this disease.|$|E

40|$|How fish embryos {{that develop}} {{externally}} survive microbial attacks is poorly understood. Here, we clearly {{demonstrated that the}} embryo extract of zebrafish and its early embryo both displayed antimicrobial activity against microbes, including pathogenic Aeromonas hydrophila, and phosvitin (Pv), a nutritional protein abundant in eggs, was related to this antimicrobial activity. We also showed that recombinant Pv (rPv) acted as a pattern recognition receptor capable of recognizing the microbial signature molecules LPS, lipoteichoic acid, and peptidoglycan, as well as binding the Gram-negative and -positive microbes Escherichia coli, A. hydrophila, and Staphylococcus aureus and functioned as an antimicrobial agent capable of killing the microbes. Furthermore, we revealed that its C-terminal 55 residues (Pt 5) with the functional sites Arg 242 and Ala 201 /Ile 203 were indispensable for Pv antimicrobial activity. Importantly, microinjection of rPv or Pt 5 into early embryos significantly enhanced their resistance to A. hydrophila challenge, and this enhanced bacterial resistance was markedly reduced by co-injection of anti-Pv antibody plus rPv (or Pt 5) but not by injection of anti-actin antibody plus rPv. Moreover, the generated mutants with in vitro antimicrobial activity, when injected into the embryos, could also promote their resistance to A. hydrophila, but those without in vitro antimicrobial activity could not. It is thus proposed that Pv participates in the protection of early embryos against pathogenic attacks via binding and disrupting potential pathogens.

40|$|Autophagy is a {{fundamental}} biological process that endows eukaryotic cells {{with the ability to}} autodigest portions of their own cytoplasm.

Autophagy acts both as an effector and a regulator of pattern recognition receptors, it supports MHC II presentation of cytosolic (self and microbial) antigens, it shapes central tolerance via thymic selection of the T cell repertoire, is an effector of Th 1 /Th 2 polarization, affects homeostasis of T, B, and specialized immune cells such as Paneth cells, and – when defective – can be a contributing factor to chronic inflammatory conditions in human populations such as Crohn's disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{mineralocorticoid}} receptor (MR) is a ligand dependent transcription factor. MR {{has been}} traditionally {{associated with the}} control of water and electrolyte homeostasis {{in order to keep}} blood pressure through aldosterone activation. However, there is growing evidence indicating that MR expression is not restricted to vascular and renal tissues, as it can be also expressed by cells of the immune system, where it responds to stimulation or antagonism, controlling immune cell function. On the other hand, aldosterone also has been associated with proinflammatory immune effects, such as the release of proinflammatory cytokines, generating oxidative stress and inducing fibrosis. The inflammatory participation of MR and aldosterone in the cardiovascular disease suggests an association with alterations in the immune system. Hypertensive patients show higher levels of proinflammatory mediators that can be modulated by MR antagonism. Although these proinflammatory properties have been observed in other autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate these effects remain unknown.

40|$|Dysbiosis {{resulting}} in gut-microbiome alterations with reduced butyrate production {{are thought to}} disrupt intestinal immune homeostasis and promote complex immune disorders. However, whether and how dysbiosis develops {{before the onset of}} overt pathology remains poorly defined. Interleukin- 15 (IL- 15) is upregulated in distressed tissue and its overexpression is thought to predispose susceptible individuals to and have a role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although <b>the</b> <b>immunological</b> <b>roles</b> of IL- 15 have been largely studied, its potential impact on the microbiota remains unexplored. Analysis of 16 S ribosomal RNA-based inventories of bacterial communities in mice overexpressing IL- 15 in the intestinal epithelium (villin-IL- 15 transgenic (v-IL- 15 tg) mice) shows distinct changes in the composition of the intestinal bacteria. Although some alterations are specific to individual intestinal compartments, others are found across the ileum, cecum and feces. In particular, IL- 15 overexpression restructures the composition of the microbiota with a decrease in butyrate-producing bacteria that is associated with a reduction in luminal butyrate levels across all intestinal compartments. Fecal microbiota transplant experiments of wild-type and v-IL- 15 tg microbiota into germ-free mice further indicate that diminishing butyrate concentration observed in the intestinal lumen of v-IL- 15 tg mice is the result of intrinsic alterations in the microbiota induced by IL- 15. This reconfiguration of the microbiota is associated with increased susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Altogether, this study reveals that IL- 15 impacts butyrate-producing bacteria and lowers butyrate levels in the absence of overt pathology, which represent events that precede and promote intestinal inflammatory diseases...|$|R

While the latter 2 strains lack all IL- 12 homologues, IL- 12 p 35 (-/-) mice still produce IL- 12 p 80 homodimers and IL- 23.

Interferon (IFN) -gamma production in IL- 12 -deficient mice was strikingly reduced during the acute and chronic stages of infection, coinciding with significantly reduced chronic-stage hepatocellular damage, as demonstrated by histological analysis and plasma aspartate transaminase measurements. In contrast, IL- 10 production was not affected {{by the absence of}} IL- 12. Taken together, these results show that, during T. congolense infection, the absence of IL- 12, but not the IL- 12 p 80 homodimer or IL- 23, leads to a reduction in IFN-gamma production, which reduces hepatic pathology and improves host survival in conjunction with IL- 10 without negatively affecting parasitemia control...|$|E

Both proliferation and interferon-γ secretion were enhanced in T cells activated in the context of antigen-presenting cells from E 0 mice. Since the macrophage–T-cell interaction depends on interactions between cell surface molecules, we assessed the expression of such molecules after in vivo stimulation with interferon-γ. This treatment caused an increased expression of the co-stimulatory surface proteins CD 40 and CD 80, and also of the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules I-Ab on macrophages of E 0 mice compared with ApoE+/+. Our data suggest that ApoE inhibits T-cell activation by reducing the density of immune stimulatory proteins on antigen-presenting cells...|$|E
40|$|Chapter summary T-cell {{activation}} requires {{interaction of}} T-cell antigen receptors with proteins {{of the major}} histocompatibility complex (antigen). This interaction {{takes place in a}} specialized cell–cell junction referred to as an <b>immunological</b> synapse. <b>The</b> <b>immunological</b> synapse contains at least two functional domains: a central cluster of engaged antigen receptors and a surrounding ring of adhesion molecules. The segregation of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) and adhesion molecules is based on size, with the TCR interaction spanning 15 nm and the lymphocyte-function-associated antigen- 1 (LFA- 1) interaction spanning 30 – 40 nm between the two cells. Therefore, the synapse is not an empty gap, but a space populated by both adhesion and signaling molecules. This chapter considers four aspects of <b>the</b> <b>immunological</b> synapse: <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of migration and stop signals, the role of the cytoskeleton, the role of self-antigenic complexes, and the role of second signals...|$|R
40|$|International audienceABSTRACT: <b>The</b> <b>immunological</b> <b>roles</b> of B-cells {{are being}} {{revealed}} as increasingly complex by functions that are largely beyond {{their commitment to}} differentiate into plasma cells and produce antibodies, the key molecular protagonists of innate immunity, and also by their compartmentalisation, a more recently acknowledged property of this immune cell category. For decades, B-cells have been recognised by their expression of an immunoglobulin that serves the function of an antigen receptor, which mediates intracellular signalling assisted by companion molecules. As such, B-cells were considered simple in their functioning {{compared to the other}} major type of immune cell, the T-lymphocytes, which comprise conventional T-lymphocyte subsets with seminal roles in homeostasis and pathology, and non-conventional T-lymphocyte subsets for which increasing knowledge is accumulating. Since the discovery that the B-cell family included two distinct categories - the non-conventional, or extrafollicular, B 1 cells, that have mainly been characterised in the mouse; and the conventional, or lymph node type, B 2 cells - plus the detailed description of the main B-cell regulator, FcγRIIb, and the function of CD 40 + antigen presenting cells as committed/memory B-cells, progress in B-cell physiology has been slower than in other areas of immunology. Cellular and molecular tools have enabled the revival of innate immunity by allowing almost all aspects of cellular immunology to be re-visited. As such, B-cells were found to express "Pathogen Recognition Receptors" such as TLRs, and use them in concert with B-cell signalling during innate and adaptive immunity. An era of B-cell phenotypic and functional analysis thus began that encompassed the study of B-cell microanatomy principally in the lymph nodes, spleen and mucosae. The novel discovery of the differential localisation of B-cells with distinct phenotypes and functions revealed the compartmentalisation of B-cells. This review thus aims to describe novel findings regarding the B-cell compartments found in the mouse as a model organism, and in human physiology and pathology. It must be emphasised that some differences are noticeable between the mouse and human systems, thus increasing the complexity of B-cell compartmentalisation. Special attention will be given to the (lymph node and spleen) marginal zones, which represent major crossroads for B-cell types and functions and a challenge for understanding better the role of B-cell specificities in innate and adaptive immunology...|$|R
40|$|To {{continue}} <b>the</b> {{search for}} <b>immunological</b> <b>roles</b> of breast milk, cDNA microarray analysis on cytokines and growth factors was performed for human milk cells. Among the 240 cytokine-related genes, osteopontin (OPN) gene ranked {{top of the}} expression. Real-time PCR revealed that the OPN mRNA levels in colostrum cells were approximately 100 times higher than those in PHA-stimulated {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMNCs), and 10 000 times higher than those in PB CD 14 + cells. The median levels of OPN mRNA in early milk or mature milk cells were more than three times higher than those in colostrum cells. Western blot analysis of human milk showed appreciable expression of full-length and short form proteins of OPN. The concentrations of full-length OPN in early milk or mature milk whey continued to be higher than those in colostrum whey and plasma as assessed by ELISA. The early milk (3 – 7 days postpartum) contained the highest concentrations of OPN protein, while the late mature milk cells (1 years postpartum) had the highest expression of OPN mRNA of all the lactating periods. The results of immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical staining indicated that OPN-producing epithelial cells and macrophages are found in actively lactating mammary glands. These results suggest that the persistently and extraordinarily high expression of OPN in human milk cells plays a potential <b>role</b> in <b>the</b> <b>immunological</b> development of breast-fed infants...|$|R
