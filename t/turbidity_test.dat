Crude direct bilirubin was extracted from the jaundiced urine in the cases of liver diseases and fractionated into ester-form bilirubin by Kosaka-Hara's method and fractionated into three bilirubin fractions by the cellulose powder column chromatography with the solvent system of n- butanol, ethanol and water (4 : 1 : 2).

40|$|Regeneration {{technologies}} such as androgenesis, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and nuclear transfer require that handling conditions do not alter oocyte ability to sustain embryo development. One important parameter in the maintenance of oocyte quality in fish is the possibility to prevent oocytes activation during manipulation. In Cyprinid, such activation {{is known to be}} delayed when Salmonid coelomic fluid is used as incubation medium. Coelomic fluid however is a biological fluid whose ability to sustain oocyte quality during in vitro incubation may be variable. The purpose of the present work was to explore this variability using Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) coelomic fluid (TCF) and Goldfish (Carassius auratus) oocytes, and to set up a test which would reflect TCF suitability for Goldfish oocyte incubation. We showed that different TCF induced very different development rates after oocyte incubation for 30 min at 20 degrees C: at 24 h post fertilization (pf) and at hatching, rates ranged between 35 % and 110 % of the non-incubated controls. When TCF (1 volume) was mixed with tap water (9 volumes), a precipitate developed whose extent was measured by spectrophotometry. This <b>turbidity</b> <b>test</b> proved to be highly correlated to development rates after Goldfish oocyte incubation in TCF (r(2) = 0. 83 at hatching, n = 150) : TCF with the highest turbidity (> 1. 5 absorbance unit at 400 nm) were the ones which altered the most the development rates after incubation (less than 50 % at hatching). This easy and rapid <b>turbidity</b> <b>test</b> can therefore be used as a reliable estimator of TCF suitability for Goldfish oocyte incubation and manipulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Background Failure {{of passive}} {{transfer}} of maternal immunity via colostrum {{can occur in}} the bovine, {{and a number of}} blood tests have been developed to test calves for this failure. It is not clear which test is most suitable for this purpose. The objective was to examine the most commonly used tests for failure of passive transfer and to decide which is most suitable for routine laboratory use. 126 serum samples were taken from calves of dairy cows after birth but prior to colostrum feeding, and at 48 h of age. Five different tests were compared against radial immunodiffusion which is considered the appropriate reference method. These tests were serum gamma-glutamyltransferase levels, serum protein levels, serum globulin levels, an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and the zinc sulphate <b>turbidity</b> <b>test.</b> Results The tests examined displayed high sensitivity but widely varying specificity. Examination of the use of different cut-off points allowed some improvement in specificity at the expense of sensitivity, but the tests which had performed best at the original cut-off points still displayed the best performance. Gamma-glutamyltransferase levels as a measure of colostrum absorption returned, in this study, the best balance between sensitivity and specificity. The ELISA used in this study and serum globulin levels displayed performance similar to the gamma-glutamyltransferase levels. Serum total protein was less successful than others examined at providing both sensitivity and specificity but may, when performed via refractometer, be useful for on-farm testing. As currently performed the poor sensitivity for which the zinc sulphate <b>turbidity</b> <b>test</b> is most often criticized is evident. Modification of the cut-off point to increase specificity is less successful at balancing these parameters than the ELISA, gamma-glutamyltransferase levels, and globulin levels.

The {{most common}} {{neurodegenerative}} disease that causes dementia in humans is Alzheimer’s disease. This degeneration of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex {{is characterized by}} the loss of memory and other very important human skills like reasoning, abstraction and language. Nowadays, around 30 million people are affected by this disease. Histologically, Alzheimer’s disease {{is characterized by the}} presence of two microscopic lesions: extracellular senile (amyloid) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The senile plaques, also known as neuritic plaques, are made of deposits of amyloid beta peptide (ABeta), which derives from beta amyloid precursor protein (APP) by consecutive proteolytic cleavages. In a previous study, four chemical compounds were found to act as inhibitors of the in vitro and in vivo aggregation of ABeta peptide. In order to develop novel inhibitors that, furthermore, are capable of being used as diagnostic tools in medicine, we have synthesized two compounds derived from one of them in which we have joined a fluorescent dye through two linkers of different length. Our later HTS <b>turbidity</b> <b>tests</b> have shown that this two new compounds keep the inhibitor activity of their predecessor, especially that one in which the linker is longer, what is considered a satisfactory starting point for coming studies.

40|$|A {{survey to}} {{determine}} the prevalence rate of hepatitis-associated antigen (HAA) was carried out among 6, 577 atomic-bomb survivors and controls in Japan. The overall prevalence rate of positive cases, determined by the micro-Ouchterlony technique, was 0. 68 %, a rate {{similar to that of}} Tokyo blood donors, and about fivefold higher than ambulatory persons in the United States and northern European countries. Younger subjects (20 - 29 years) of both sexes showed the highest rates, and a trend toward higher rates during the spring and summer was noted. History of liver disease, injections and vaccination within 12 months, acupunctures within six months, or ingestion of raw shellfish were not more prevalent among subjects with positive HAA responses. A significant relationship was shown between positive cases and a history of multiple blood transfusions. There was no statistically significant relationship between antigenemia and ex-posure to the A-bomb. Higher values for serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase activity and thymol <b>turbidity</b> <b>tests</b> were noted among those who were HAA positive compared with those who were HAA negative. However, these are differences in distribution only, since there are no significant increases in rate of HAA among those who had abnormal values for liver function tests. In 1965, Blumberg et al. reported a newly dis-covered isoprecipitin that they named Australia antigen [1]. Subsequent intensive study has fur-Received for publication January 28, 1972, and in revised form February 12, 1973. This study was supported with funds provided by th...|$|R
