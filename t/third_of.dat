5|$|The <b>Third</b> <b>of</b> May {{is cited}} as an {{influence}} on Pablo Picasso's 1937 Guernica, which shows {{the aftermath of the}} Nazi German bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. An exhibition in 2006 at the Prado and the Reina Sofía showed The <b>Third</b> <b>of</b> May, Guernica, and the Execution of the Emperor Maximilian in the same room. Also in the room was Picasso's Massacre in Korea, painted in 1951 during the Korean War—an even more direct reference to the composition of The <b>Third</b> <b>of</b> May. The perpetrators in this painting were intended to be the United States Army or their United Nations allies.|$|E

40|$|This {{communication}} hypothesises a rule <b>of</b> two <b>thirds</b> {{which seems}} to operate in Indian diabetes epidemiology. Two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> all persons with dysglycemia are prediabetic; two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> all persons with diabetes are diagnosed to have the condtion; and two thirds are diagnosed {{before the age of}} 50 years. Two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> people with diabetes have concomitant hypetension or dyslipidemia; two thirds do not get their HbA 1 c assessed; and two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> those who do, do not achiev target values. Yet, two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> people with diabetes report satisfactory psychosocial health and quality of life, and adherence to dietary therapy and medication. Only one thirds adhere to exercise and self monitoring advice, however. Two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> persons on oral glucose lowering drugs receive metformin; two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> those on insulin receive premixed insulin or twice daily isnuslin, and a similar proportion uses pens for delivery. Thus, the rule <b>of</b> two <b>thirds,</b> rather than <b>of</b> halves, operates in modern Indian diabetes practice...|$|R
