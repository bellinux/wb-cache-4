5|$|The {{remaining}} {{members of the}} Sicilian aristocracy who still inhabit their ancestral palazzi are unable to make opening their houses to tourism {{a major source of}} income, unlike some Northern, especially English, counterparts. The local equivalent of the National Trust is very small, and there is much less local interest among the general population. The Princes, Marquesses, and Counts of Sicily still living in their houses dwell in splendid isolation, surrounded often by beauty and decay. It is only today both owners and the state are awakening to the possibility that if action is not taken soon it will be too late <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>this</b> particular part of the Sicilian heritage.|$|E
5|$|This was a storyline that Russell T Davies {{thought up}} {{as a final}} one-part special for David Tennant on Doctor Who, (this was going to air around Easter 2010, near the time Series 5 would be airing.). The plot would have been that the Doctor finds a {{spaceship}} with an alien family on board (Russell mockingly titled them 'The Proestix Family'.) where the ship was broken, in the special {{he would have to}} sacrifice his life <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>this</b> family. This was a choice of a plotline which was also brought up with a two part special that then became The End of Time that he told to Jane Tranter and Julie Gardner. The Proestex family was kept in the special but were changed to be the Vinvocci, Aaddams and Rossiter.|$|E

25|$|The Atlantic {{humpback}} dolphin (Sousa teuszii) is {{endemic to}} West Africa. Several stocks {{have been identified}} with numbers ranging from tens to a few hundred. Abundance estimates are lacking. Gaps in the species range and hence distribution is evident. Bycatch is only documented in a few West African countries. Surveys and evaluations need to be conducted to determine the presence/ absence of humpback dolphins in their historical range. Conservation measures need to be implemented <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>this</b> species. Because many people live off the sea, it is not feasible to have complete gillnet closures. Some areas may be designated as off-limits to gillnet fisheries. Eco-tourism may be implemented successfully because of high species diversity.|$|E
25|$|However, {{these laws}} {{focus on the}} {{protection}} of individuals, rather than their habitat, and so may do little to mitigate the greatest threat that populations face. Fortunately, {{there are a number}} of projects specifically working <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>this</b> vulnerable insect. A conservation programme in Pieniny National Park saved a subspecies of the Apollo butterfly that had declined to just 20 individuals in the early 1990s, through a combination of captive breeding and habitat protection. In south-west Germany, conservationists are working with shepherds to ensure favourable conditions for the butterflies, which share their grassland habitat with sheep. For example, grazing periods have been shifted to avoid the Apollo butterfly larvae stage, which is vulnerable to being trampled.|$|E

25|$|On flight day 11, {{the crew}} of Space Shuttle Endeavour {{conducted}} a late inspection of the orbiter's Thermal Protection System. On most previous flights, this inspection was performed after the shuttle undocked from the ISS. However, {{in this case it}} was done early, because the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) was to be left on board the ISS after Endeavours departure. The joint Expedition 28/STS-134 crew held a news conference with reporters on the ground at NASA centers around the country and ISS partner agencies. Commander Mark Kelly also spoke to reporters from four Tucson, Arizona television stations. Later in the crew day, the joint crew held an EVA procedure review for the fourth and final spacewalk of STS-134. Astronauts Mike Fincke and Greg Chamitoff spent the night in the Quest Airlock with the air pressure reduced to 10.2 Psi, so as to avoid decompression sickness during their spacewalk. The crew and flight controllers on the ground opted not to use the In-suit Light Exercise (ISLE) protocol that was tested during EVA 3 earlier in the mission, opting instead to go with the standard campout protocol, since it was discovered that ISLE used more carbon-dioxide scrubbing capability. They wanted <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>this</b> capability, since a CO2 sensor in Chamitoff's suit had failed during EVA 1, cutting that spacewalk short.|$|E
500|$|Overture – The {{original}} overture, used in all stage productions up to 1946 (and {{heard on}} the three-disc EMI/Angel CD {{for the first time}} in nearly 50 years), is based chiefly on the deleted song [...] "Mis'ry's Comin' Round", as Kern wanted <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>this</b> song in some form. The song was restored in the Harold Prince 1994 revival of the show. The overture also contains fragments of [...] "Ol' Man River", [...] "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man", and a faster arrangement of [...] "Why Do I Love You?" [...] The overtures for the 1946 revival and the 1966 Lincoln Center revival consist of medleys of songs from the show. All three overtures were arranged by the show's orchestrator, Robert Russell Bennett, who orchestrated most of Kern's later shows.|$|E

Burnham observed that fewer than 150 of these sheep still lived in the Arizona mountains. He called George F.

Burnham put it this way, [...] "I want you <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>this</b> majestic animal, not only because it is in danger of extinction, but of more importance, some day it might provide domestic sheep with a strain to save them from disaster {{at the hands of a}} yet unknown virus." ...|$|E
2500|$|Belaney's {{first book}} called The Men of the Last Frontier was {{published}} in 1931, and it traced the devastating story of the beaver as well as posed some very valid concerns {{about the future of}} Canada and its forests. Beaver pelts had become such a hot commodity in Canadian industry that the beaver {{was on the verge of}} extinction when Anahareo helped Belaney understand the desperate need for protecting the animal instead of trapping it. According to Belaney in The Men of the Last Frontier, trappers swarmed to the forests in higher numbers than ever before in 1930 because of the beaver's scarcity, and he argued that the only way <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>this</b> animal was to remove all of the trappers from the forests. This was an extremely difficult feat however because their pelts were so valuable and the job economy was so poor in the 1930s that he described their role in the economy as [...] "beavers [...] to the north what gold was to the west". Though much of his focus in his writings were on the beaver, he also believed that this animal could be used as a symbol for the disappearing future of Canadian wilderness in a broader sense. Belaney believed that Canada's wilderness and vastly open nature was what made it unique from other countries of the world, and this was disappearing at an extremely fast rate due to consumerism and the modernist emphasis on capital.|$|E
