5|$|A person under 21 who {{is convicted}} of driving with a BAC level {{of at least}} 0.01%, but less than 0.08% will have their driver's license {{suspended}} for 1 to 3 months, be required to perform 15–30 hours of community service, and take part in an alcohol education program. Penalties for refusal <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>a</b> breath sample {{are the same as}} driving with a BAC over 0.15%. The holder of a commercial driver's license (CDL) is subject to a one-year suspension of their CDL for the first offense, and a lifetime CDL suspension for repeat offenses if they drive a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or greater, drive an automobile with a BAC of 0.08% or greater, or refuse <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>a</b> breath sample. More severe penalties may be imposed if the DUI took place within 1000 feet of a school, or if there was a juvenile in the vehicle. DUI accidents resulting in serious injury or death are considered indictable crimes.|$|E

5|$|HMS Swordfish was {{developed}} to meet a requirement of Royal Navy's Submarine Committee for a large submarine capable of operating with the fleet at a surfaced speed of 20 knots. Most of the earlier British submarines had been single-hulled vessels built by Vickers, and the Navy was interested in evaluating other designs. Captain Roger Keyes, Inspecting Captain of Submarines, had previously served as naval attaché in Italy and had kept abreast of Italian submarine developments, which notably included double-hulled submarines designed by Cesare Laurenti of Fiat-San Giorgio. Three boats of the S class were ordered first and Laurenti was invited <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>a</b> design to meet the RN requirement.|$|E

The medal was to be given in gold to the heads of state and in silver to the victorious generals. Others to be honoured would receive the medal in bronze. The usual procedure for the time was followed: the Royal Academy were asked <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>a</b> design. They proposed work by one of their members, John Flaxman.|$|E

Thompson initially received a Silver Star Medal for the action, but after Blair changed his mind he began pushing the paperwork through, personally locating the witnesses who could attest to Thompson's valor. Blair hoped Thompson's recognition would improve other commanders' views on the 24th Infantry Regiment. Eventually, though, that unit was disbanded and its personnel integrated into other units.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{new ideas}} about the {{treatment}} of alcoholism, the lifetime suspension was downgraded to a 10-year suspension in 1952. DUI prosecutions remained difficult in cases when drivers refused to take a Breathalyzer test, and so in 1966, the state authorized the suspension of a person's driver's license for refusing <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>a</b> breath sample. In 1977, the BAC limit was reduced to 0.10%, but the law was modified to differentiate between {{the second and third}} offenses, with lesser penalties for first and second convictions. In 1983, the state established a per se rule wherein a person over the limit was considered drunk in all cases (that is, not merely a presumption). Nine years later, the 0.01% BAC limit for drivers under 21 was instituted, and in 2003, the 0.10% BAC limit was reduced to 0.08% to comply with federal highway funding requirements.|$|E

From March to August 1999, Interplay also held a Descent 3 tournament in the United States consisting of three phases where numerous players could compete against each other in multiplayer matches.
