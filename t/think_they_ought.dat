6000|$|... "He's not hating them now," [...] said Mrs. Johnson, [...] "you may {{be sure of}} that. It's {{just because}} of that I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to come--all of them--even your Aunt Mildred." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{order to}} this, I must offer my countrymen and fellow-citizens some reasons why I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> {{to be more}} than ordinarily careful, at this juncture, upon whom they bestow their votes.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{some trouble}} over that new {{road to the}} fort," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "I understand Colonel Washington is awfully cut up over it. He <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to use the old Braddock road and polish up the Frenchmen in short order." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know that, and I {{have been}} meaning {{to talk with you}} about it. Why can't we give Mr. Simpson and him an equal share with us? I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> really <b>ought</b> to have it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will make}} you happy {{to know that you}} are making your mother happy, and the dear girls--and--and I have no doubt you will very soon get used to it. Many clergymen, you know, <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> not to marry." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{would act}} as a {{stimulus}} to them to keep up their position and show themselves worthy of the honor?--Yes. I do not <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to be mixed at all as they are now.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am not a}} {{classical}} scholar," [...] said Mr. Vigo, [...] "but {{there are two things}} which I think I understand--men and horses. I like to back them both when I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to win." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Askew good humoredly. [...] "It's {{curious that}} Mr. Thorn hinted {{something}} like that. Anyhow, I'm not {{a champion of}} the otter's right to destroy useful fish. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to be shot." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "To {{paint in}} earth's dull colours the forms clothed {{in the living}} light of other worlds, — Besant writes in the foreword, — is a hard and thankless task." [...] The authors claim that the images in the book [...] "are not {{imaginary}} forms, prepared as some dreamer <b>thinks</b> that <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to appear." [...] Rather, [...] "they ...|$|R
60|$|It was Matilda {{who paid}} {{the cost of}} that stone, Miss Selby who drew the pattern of it, and 'Mother' who chose the words, as what Alfred himself loved best. At the bottom of Ellen's best work-box is a copy of verses about that very cross. She <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to have been carved out upon it, but Paul knows a great deal better, so all she could do was to write them out on a sheet of note-paper with a wide lace border, and keep them as her {{greatest}} treasure. Perhaps she prizes them even more than the handsome watch that Mr. Shaw gave Paul, though less, of course, than the great Bible and Prayer-book, in which Mr. Cope has waited till this morning to write the names of Paul and Ellen Blackthorn.|$|R
6000|$|A fourth {{quality of}} Chaucer is his broad tolerance, his {{absolute}} disinterestedness. He leaves reforms to Wyclif and Langland, and can laugh with the Shipman who turns smuggler, {{or with the}} worldly Monk whose [...] "jingling" [...] bridle keeps others as well as himself from hearing the chapel bell. He will not even criticize the fickle Cressida for deserting Troilus, saying that men tell tales about her, which is punishment enough for any woman. In fine, Chaucer is content to picture {{a world in which}} the rain falleth alike upon the just and the unjust, and in which the latter seem to have a liberal share of the umbrellas. He enjoys it all, and describes its inhabitants as they are, not as he <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to be. The reader may think that this or that character deserves to come to a bad end; but not so Chaucer, who regards them all as kindly, as impersonally as Nature herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot see," [...] said he, {{speaking}} to the company in general, [...] "why babies are not brought to the table. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to be taught {{from the very beginning}} how to behave themselves at meals." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Honestly, honestly,--how I {{hate that}} word! It's always used by prigs," [...] cried Evelyn. [...] "Honestly I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to be. That's what's so disappointing. Every time one thinks it's {{not going to}} happen, and every time it does." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{they say}} {{that you are going to}} marry that horrible man Mulready. It is monstrous, isn't it? I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to be prosecuted and punished for such a wicked thing, and father only a year in his grave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, I don't know. My {{grandfather}} {{or someone}} {{was a bit}} of a pro at verse in his day, I believe, and <b>they</b> <b>think</b> it <b>ought</b> to run in the family.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well;--you {{had better}} go to her. You see, Mr. Gibson, young ladies, {{when they are}} going to be married, <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to have their own way a little, just for the last time, you know." [...] He took no notice of the joke, but went with slow steps up to the drawing-room. It would be inquiring too curiously to ask whether Camilla, when she embraced him, discerned that he had {{fortified}} his courage that morning with a glass of curacoa.|$|R
6000|$|... "Personally," [...] the Professor exclaimed, {{his eyes}} {{sparkling}} with appreciation {{of his own}} wit, [...] "I <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to have got it round the neck! However, let us be thankful that they are disposed of. Their attack upon you, Mr. Quest, introduced rather a curious factor into our troubles. Even now I find it a little difficult to follow the workings of our friend French's mind. It seems {{hard to believe that}} he could really have imagined you guilty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never knew}} an honest-minded Mingo,--one {{that you could}} put faith in, {{if he had a}} temptation to deceive you. Cheating seems to be their gift, and I {{sometimes}} <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to be pitied for it, rather than persecuted." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, I {{started off}} to {{interview}} Mrs. Darrell, and, believe me, I didn't like the prospect. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to train A. D. T. messengers {{to do this}} sort of thing. I found her alone. The rush hour of clients hadn't begun.|$|E
6000|$|HIGGINS. What they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> {{to think}} is bad enough, Lord knows; {{but what they}} really think would break up the whole show. Do you suppose {{it would be really}} {{agreeable}} if I were to come out now with what I really think? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Little Sarah is--let me see--quite a child. Her {{father did}} teach her, {{but he has}} less time in his new parish, and <b>they</b> <b>think</b> she <b>ought</b> to have more accomplishment, polish, and such like.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Candidates {{that helped}} the two finalists were {{brought back to the}} final {{boardroom}} session to give their comments. Yuen Wai did not turn up. When asked to choose who <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>ought</b> to win, Masami, Ridzuan, and Jeniffer chose Dian, while Kian You picked Ain.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why don't <b>they</b> <b>think</b> he <b>ought</b> to be captain? The {{head of the}} House {{is always}} captain of the House team unless he's too bad {{to be in it}} at all. Don't the chaps think Gethryn's good at cricket?' ...|$|R
60|$|The circus {{men were}} vastly {{surprised}} {{when they learned}} that it was Tommy who had captured the chimpanzee. At first they did not <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to pay the lad the reward, but Shep told them {{they could not have}} Abe unless they did so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{suppose you}} would say that a man ought {{to get as much}} for his work as an {{employer}} gets for his capital. If you think one has as much at stake as the other, you must <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to be paid alike." ...|$|E
60|$|Some {{time the}} boys watched for Toby's return, {{and just as}} they were {{beginning}} to <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to go in search of him, and fearing lest he had been hurt by the vicious pony, they saw him coming from among the trees, alone and on foot.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} he makes anything. And then think of his father! He is--illegitimate!" [...] Sir Thomas seemed rather to sneer at this. [...] "And if you knew the way the old man lives in Rome! He plays cards all Sunday!" [...] Again Sir Thomas sneered. Sir Thomas was fairly {{submissive}} to the conventionalities himself, but did not <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> {{to stand in the}} way of a provision for a young lady who had no provision of her own. [...] "You wouldn't wish to have him at Queen's Gate?" [...] asked Lady Tringle.|$|R
60|$|A. They would {{certainly}} object to it, as an excise is unconnected with any service done, and {{is merely an}} aid, which <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>ought</b> to be asked of them and granted by them, {{if they are to}} pay it, and can be granted for them by no others whatsoever, whom they have not empowered for that purpose.|$|R
60|$|Such {{a terrible}} letter {{it was in}} its import, though couched in the gentlest language. In his absence Grace had grown to regard him with toleration, and her {{relation}} to him with equanimity, till she had almost forgotten how trying his presence would be. He wrote briefly and unaffectedly; he made no excuses, but informed {{her that he was}} living quite alone, and had been led to <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to be together, if she would make up her mind to forgive him. He therefore purported to cross the Channel to Budmouth by the steamer on a day he named, which she found to be three days after the time of her present reading.|$|R
6000|$|... "Asking your pardon, Mr. Tyrrwhit," [...] said Mr. Hart, [...] "but, {{as this is}} {{a meeting}} of {{creditors}} who 'ave a largish {{lot of money to}} deal with, I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to part without expressing their opinions in the way of British commerce. I say crucifying 'd be too good for 'im." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! she {{may well}} look over-worked to-night,' said Sir Edward; 'she has a spirit in her {{which would not}} let her rest on such a day as this.--Come here, Miss Lizzie,' said he, beckoning to her, 'I want you to account for those two red spots upon your cheeks. Do you <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to be there?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I help {{thinking}} it? You can't deny, nor can uncle, that the houses belong to him. The papers got into uncle's hands {{when he and}} father were together, and I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to be given up now. Father thinks that the Trendellsohns should have them. Even though they are Jews, {{they have a right}} to their own." ...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the way in}} which neoliberalism is conceptualized in human geography. It argues that, in theorizing neoliberalism as `a political project’, critical human geographers have ended up reproducing the same problem that they ascribe to the ideas they take to be driving forces behind contemporary transformations: they reduce the social to a residual effect of more fundamental political-economic rationalities. Proponents of free markets think that people should act like utility-maximizing rational egoists, despite much evidence that they don't. Critics of neoliberalism tend to assume that increasingly people do act like this, but <b>they</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> not to. For critics, this is what's wrong with neoliberalism. And it is precisely this evaluation that suggests that {{there is something wrong with}} how neoliberalism is theorized in critical human geography...|$|R
