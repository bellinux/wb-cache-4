5|$|Several {{sources have}} {{reported}} 610 officers as {{being involved in}} or ordering the <b>torture</b> <b>of</b> Falun Gong adherents in custody. In a letter to Chinese leaders in 2005, prominent human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng relayed accounts of 610 officers beating and sexually assaulting Falun Gong practitioners: “of all the true accounts of incredible violence that I have heard, of all {{the records of the}} government’s inhuman <b>torture</b> <b>of</b> its own people, what has shaken me most is the routine practice {{on the part of the}} 6–10 Office and the police of assaulting women’s genitals,” wrote Gao. Defector Hao Fengjun described witnessing one of his 610 Office colleagues beating an elderly female Falun Gong practitioner with an iron bar. The event helped catalyze Hao's decision to defect to Australia. The 2009 report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Killings relayed allegations that the 610 Office was involved in the torture deaths of Falun Gong practitioners ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.|$|E

5|$|Gao Zhisheng, once {{recognized}} as one of China's ten most promising lawyers, was an advocate for a range of disenfranchised individuals and minorities. In 2006, after he wrote a series of letters to the Chinese leadership concerning the <b>torture</b> <b>of</b> Falun Gong adherents, Gao had his legal license revoked and his law firm was shut down. His family was placed under house arrest, and he was detained for six months. Gao was sentenced, with a five-year reprieve, to four years in prison.

5|$|Mayor Daley and all law {{enforcement}} officials who had been deposed {{were excluded from the}} report. Also, the 75 credible abuse cases were overlooked; the report focused on doubts about the <b>torture</b> <b>of</b> the four pardoned death row inmates. Among the final costs were $6.2 million for the investigation and $7 million to hire outside counsel for Burge and his cohort. Many activists were disappointed to learn that the statute of limitations meant that Burge would not be prosecuted for torture. Debates in the op-ed pages continued for days. Egan explained his report to the public with legal theories and federal jurisdiction issues.|$|E
5|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, creatures known as Sarnathians ruled the Earth, {{centring}} their values on <b>torture</b> <b>of</b> other creatures that {{were opposed to}} their rule.

Thousands of years later, the orb became too powerful and eventually caused a tear in the inter-dimensional fabric of the Realm of Reality and the Realm of Unreality, thus rendering the Sarnathians extinct.|$|E

5|$|The {{first ten}} months of Nayyouf's {{sentence}} were served in Sednaya Prison outside Damascus. While at Sednaya, Nayyouf tried {{to organize a}} prisoner revolt. He was moved to Palmyra prison near Tadmur. In 1993, Nayyouf went on a thirteen-day hunger strike at Palmyra in order to protest the <b>torture</b> <b>of</b> prisoners. While at Palmyra, Nayyouf was able to pass evidence that the prisoners were being tortured to the press outside, which led to another transfer to Mezzeh prison, a military prison outside Damascus. Most of his ten-year sentence was spent in solitary confinement in Mezzeh.|$|E

40|$|Objectives To {{measure the}} {{frequency}} <b>of</b> people reporting <b>torture</b> among {{patients in a}} medical outpatient clinic and to determine primary care physicians' awareness of their patients' exposure to torture. Design Cross-sectional survey followed by selected in-depth interviews of participants reporting a history <b>of</b> <b>torture.</b> Medical record review and interview <b>of</b> <b>torture</b> survivors' primary care physicians. Setting The internal medicine clinic of a large, urban medical center. Participants A convenience sample of 121 adult patients who were not born in the United States and who were attending the adult ambulatory care clinic. Interventions All participants were interviewed using the Detection <b>of</b> <b>Torture</b> Survivors Survey, a validated instrument that asks about exposure to torture according to the World Medical Association definition <b>of</b> <b>torture.</b> Participants who reported a history <b>of</b> <b>torture</b> were interviewed in depth to confirm {{that they had been}} tortured. We reviewed the medical records of participants who reported a history <b>of</b> <b>torture</b> and interviewed their primary care physicians. Main outcome measures Self-reported history <b>of</b> <b>torture.</b> The awareness <b>of</b> primary care physicians of this history. Results Eight of 121 participants (6. 6 % [95 % confidence interval: 3. 1 %- 13. 1 %]) reported a history <b>of</b> <b>torture.</b> None <b>of</b> the survivors <b>of</b> <b>torture</b> had been identified as such by their primary care physician. Conclusions Physicians of patients who have not been born in the United States and who attend urban general medical clinics frequently are unaware that their patients are survivors <b>of</b> <b>torture.</b> Primary care physicians can be the locus of intervention in the care <b>of</b> <b>torture</b> survivors. The first step is for physicians to recognize the possibility <b>of</b> <b>torture</b> survivors among their patients...|$|R

5|$|While {{some were}} {{executed}} quickly, others were tortured before being killed. The public <b>torture</b> <b>of</b> prisoners was a traditional ritual in many tribes of the Eastern Woodlands. Captives {{might have to}} endure excruciating torture for hours and even days. The British Indian Department used its influence to discourage the killing and torturing of prisoners, with some success, but in 1782 the Indians revived the practice of ritual torture in order to exact revenge for the slaughter at Gnadenhütten.|$|E
5|$|After the war, five Croatian {{fighters were}} charged and convicted of eleven counts of murder, one of {{attempted}} murder, {{and one of}} <b>torture</b> <b>of</b> Serb civilians found in the JNA barracks, which surrendered on 15 September 1991. They received prison sentences of between five and eight years. Glavaš, who was tried alongside them for the same crimes, received a ten-year sentence. Before the conviction became final in 2009, and to avoid extradition, Glavaš fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he had granted citizenship. His sentence was reduced to eight years and became final in 2010, {{when he was arrested}} and imprisoned in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In January 2015, the conviction was set aside by the Constitutional Court of Croatia, pending a new trial before the Supreme Court of Croatia.|$|E

He used this position of respect to lobby for fair treatment of those interned. He successfully petitioned the Japanese overlords to exempt nuns from the paramilitary draft {{and allow them to}} work at hospitals. He and the Catholic populace also gathered food and other supplies for interned clergy, and Soegijapranata kept in contact with the prisoners, supplying and receiving news, such as recent deaths, and other information.|$|E

5|$|The first {{allegations}} of detainee abuse came in early February 2007, when University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran produced documents {{he had received}} through an access-to-information request showing that three prisoners {{in the custody of}} Canadian military police were brought in by their Afghan interrogator for treatment of similar injuries to the head and upper body, all on the same day. Attaran argued this could be evidence of torture {{on the part of the}} interrogator and should be investigated. Attaran has maintained these allegations, stating in 2010 that the documents show <b>torture</b> <b>of</b> detainees was an actual tactic used to obtain information during interrogation.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{histories}} of the Bastille were published immediately after July 1789, usually with dramatic titles promising the uncovering of secrets from the prison. By the 1830s and 1840s, popular histories written by Pierre Joigneaux and by the trio of Auguste Maquet, Auguste Arnould and Jules-Édouard Alboize de Pujol presented {{the years of the}} Bastille between 1358 and 1789 as a single, long period of royal tyranny and oppression, epitomised by the fortress; their works featured imaginative 19th-century reconstructions of the medieval <b>torture</b> <b>of</b> prisoners. As living memories of the Revolution faded, the destruction of the Bastille meant that later historians had to rely primarily on memoires and documentary materials in analysing the fortress and the 5,279 prisoners who had come through the Bastille between 1659 and 1789. The Bastille's archives, recording the operation of the prison, had been scattered in the confusion after the seizure; with some effort, the Paris Assembly gathered around 600,000 of them in the following weeks, which form the basis of the modern archive. After being safely stored and ignored for many years, these archives were rediscovered by the French historian François Ravaisson, who catalogued and used them for research between 1866 and 1904.|$|E
5|$|Although Evans {{had led the}} {{kidnapping}} and <b>torture</b> <b>of</b> a black man while leader of the Dallas Klan, as Imperial Wizard he publicly discouraged vigilante actions, fearing that they would hinder his attempts to gain political influence. In 1923, Evans presided over the largest Klan gathering in history, attended by over 200,000, and endorsed several successful candidates in 1924 elections. He moved the Klan's headquarters from Atlanta to Washington, D.C., and organized a march of 30,000 members—the largest march in the organization's history—on Pennsylvania Avenue. Evans' efforts notwithstanding, the Klan was buffeted by damaging publicity in the early 1920s, partially because of leadership struggles between Evans and his rivals, which hindered his political efforts. In the 1930s, the Great Depression significantly decreased the Klan's income, prompting Evans {{to work for a}} construction company to supplement his pay. He resigned his position with the Klan in 1939, after disavowing anti-Catholicism. He was succeeded by his chief of staff, James A. Colescott. The next year, Evans faced accusations of involvement in a government corruption scandal in Georgia; he was fined $15,000 after legal proceedings.|$|E
