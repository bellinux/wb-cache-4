Her Campuss Kelly Tierney noted the enthusiasm displayed by Oliver's fans during the segment and wrote: While John Oliver simply considers himself a comedian, it is apparent that he is doing much more than comedy. [...] He informs us of real issues we otherwise wouldn't hear or think deeply about, which in and of itself is brilliant, but what really sets him apart is his way of calling his audience to action about these issues. He shows us <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> something we can do and helps us to see how we can enact change.|$|E

In {{an interview}} on HLN's The Joy Behar Show, she said: [...] "As I was writing the book, I thought, this word, it kept sitting wrong with me. But I used it {{for lack of a better}} word. Since then, I've been schooled by thousands of incest survivors all across the world <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> no such thing as consensual incest due to the inherent power a parent has over a child. So, I wouldn't necessarily call it a consensual relationship at this time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{ubiquitous}} rubric [...] "criticism of Israel", however, {{has also}} come to designate another kind of discourse—one that has almost become a politico-rhetorical genre unto itself, with its own identifiable vocabulary, narrative conventions, and predictable outcomes. At its ideational core is what the British scholar Bernard Harrison calls a [...] "dialectical scam". It goes something like this: (1) Spot an Israeli action that can serve as the ground of [...] "criticism of Israel" [...] (e.g., Israel's military incursion into the area near Jenin in April 2002 in response to Palestinian terrorist massacres); (2) Then [...] "dissent" [...] in the strongest possible terms, for instance by likening the [...] "razing of Jenin" [...] {{to the destruction of}} the Warsaw Ghetto, while anticipating that [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "repressive" [...] Jewish institutions will try to [...] "silence" [...] the critics by calling them anti-Semites; (3) When taken to task by more sober-minded critics who find that, contrary to your charge, {{there was no such thing}} as [...] "the razing of Jenin" [...] and that the IDF has nothing in common with the SS, cry [...] "foul" [...] and claim their censure perfectly illustrates the point <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a Jewish organizational conspiracy to silence [...] "criticism of Israel" [...] by branding the authors of such criticism [...] "antisemites".|$|E

60|$|Now, the {{evidence}} of history and that of human nature combine, by a striking instance of consilience, to show <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> one social element which is thus predominant, and almost paramount, among the agents of the social progression.

60|$|I never {{realized}} so much <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> no natural prejudice against {{color in the}} human mind.

I have never seen {{in any of the}} persons to whom I have presented her the least indications of suppressed surprise or disgust, any more than we should exhibit on the reception of a dark-complexioned Spaniard or Portuguese. Miss Greenfield bears her success with much quietness and good sense.|$|E
60|$|Almost all the {{processes}} {{employed in the}} arts and manufactures fall within the range either of physics or of chemistry. In order to improve them, one must thoroughly understand them; and no one has a chance of really understanding them, unless he has obtained that mastery of principles and that habit of dealing with facts, which is given by long-continued and well-directed purely scientific training in the physical and the chemical laboratory. So <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> no question as to the necessity of purely scientific discipline, even if the work of the College were limited by the narrowest interpretation of its stated aims.|$|E

So, I pass to my hotel, enchanted; sup, enchanted; go to bed, enchanted; pushing back this morning (if it really were this morning) into the remoteness of time, blessing the South-Eastern Company for realising the Arabian Nights in these prose days, murmuring, as I wing my idle flight into the land of dreams, 'No hurry, ladies and gentlemen, going to Paris in eleven hours. It is so well done, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> no hurry!' ...|$|E

5000|$|Defense: Corona’s Answer quoted Justice Roberto Abad’s {{concurring opinion}} in Navarro to better explain <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> no flip-flopping in the League of Cities case: “Of 23 Justices who {{voted in the}} case at any of its various stages, 20 Justices stood by their {{original}} positions.

60|$|But the {{difficulty}} {{in the case of}} the cat is nothing compared to {{the difficulty}} in the case of human beings. When human beings speak--that is, when we hear certain noises which we associate with ideas, and simultaneously see certain motions of lips and expressions of face--it is very difficult to suppose that what we hear is not the expression of a thought, as we know it would be if we emitted the same sounds. Of course similar things happen in dreams, where we are mistaken as to the existence of other people. But dreams are more or less suggested by what we call waking life, and are capable of being more or less accounted for on scientific principles if we assume <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a physical world. Thus every principle of simplicity urges us to adopt the natural view, that there really are objects other than ourselves and our sense-data which have an existence not dependent upon our perceiving them.|$|E
6000|$|Just so. But {{the fatal}} {{truth is that}} these things are capital; and <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> no {{fundamental}} distinction between land and capital. Is it denied that a fertile field, a rich vein of ore, or a falling stream, may form part of a man's stock, and that, if they do, {{they are capable of}} yielding revenue? Will not somebody pay a share of the produce in kind, or in money, for the privilege of cultivating the first royalties for that of working the second; and a like equivalent for that of erecting a mill on the third? In what sense, then, are these things less [...] "capital" [...] than the buildings and tools which on page 27 of [...] "Progress and Poverty" [...] are admitted to be capital? Is it not plain that if these things confer [...] "advantages equivalent to the possession of capital," [...] and if the [...] "advantage" [...] of capital is nothing but the yielding of revenue, then the denial that they are capital is merely a roundabout way of self-contradiction? ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{told that}} it is a maxim among the {{improvers}} of cattle that you may breed to any degree of nicety you please, and they found this maxim upon another, which {{is that some of the}} offspring will possess the desirable qualities of the parents in a greater degree. In the famous Leicestershire breed of sheep, the object is to procure them with small heads and small legs. Proceeding upon these breeding maxims, it is evident that we might go on till the heads and legs were evanescent quantities, but this is so palpable an absurdity that we may be quite sure that the premises are not just and <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a limit, though we cannot see it or say exactly where it is. In this case, the point of the greatest degree of improvement, or the smallest size of the head and legs, may be said to be undefined, but this is very different from unlimited, or from indefinite, in Mr Condorcet's acceptation of the term. Though I may not be able in the present instance to mark the limit at which further improvement will stop, I can very easily mention a point at which it will not arrive. I should not scruple to assert that were the breeding to continue for ever, the head and legs of these sheep would never be so small as the head and legs of a rat.|$|E
5000|$|Knight {{undertook}} his own research, {{which established}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> a coachman named John Netley; that an unnamed child was knocked {{down in the}} Strand in October 1888 and that a man named [...] "Nickley" [...] attempted suicide by drowning from Westminster Bridge in 1892.

60|$|Of course I don't {{believe in}} the old legend about James I; and as for you, you don't believe in anything, not even in journalism. The legend, you'll {{probably}} remember, was about the blackest business in English history--the poisoning of Overbury by that witch's cat Frances Howard, and the quite mysterious terror which forced the King to pardon the murderers. There {{was a lot of}} alleged witchcraft mixed up with it; and the story goes that a man-servant listening at the keyhole heard the truth in a talk between the King and Carr; and the bodily ear with which he heard grew large and monstrous as by magic, so awful was the secret. And though he had to be loaded with lands and gold and made an ancestor of dukes, the elf-shaped ear is still recurrent in the family. Well, you don't believe in black magic; and if you did, you couldn't use it for copy. If a miracle happened in your office, you'd have to hush it up, now so many bishops are agnostics. But that is not the point The point is <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> something queer about Exmoor and his family; something quite natural, I dare say, but quite abnormal. And the Ear is in it somehow, I fancy; either a symbol or a delusion or disease or something. Another tradition says that Cavaliers just after James I began to wear their hair long only to cover the ear of the first Lord Exmoor. This also is no doubt fanciful.|$|E
60|$|From Gloucester I {{took the}} rail for Basingstoke before noon. The {{first part of}} the journey was through an uncommonly {{beautiful}} tract of country, hilly, but not wild; a tender and graceful picturesqueness,--fine, single trees and clumps of trees, and sometimes wide woods, scattered over the landscape, and filling the nooks of the hills with luxuriant foliage. Old villages scattered frequently along our track, looking very peaceful, with the peace of past ages lingering about them; and a rich, rural verdure of antique cultivation everywhere. Old country-seats--specimens of the old English hall or manor-house--appeared on the hillsides, with park-scenery surrounding the mansions; and the gray churches rose {{in the midst of all}} the little towns. The beauty of English scenery makes me desperate, it is so impossible to describe it, or in any way to record its impression, and such a pity to leave it undescribed; and, moreover, I always feel that I do not get from it a hundredth or a millionth part of the enjoyment <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> in it, hurrying past it thus. I was really glad when we rumbled into a tunnel, piercing for a long distance through a hill; and, emerging on the other side, we found ourselves in a comparatively level and uninteresting tract of country, which lasted till we reached Southampton. English scenery, to be appreciated and to be reproduced with pen and pencil, requires to be dwelt upon long, and to be wrought out with the nicest touches. A coarse and hasty brush is not the instrument for such work.|$|E
6000|$|... § 5. So {{much for}} the first of Dr. Whewell’s conditions, that conceptions must be appropriate. The second is, that they shall be “clear:” and let us {{consider}} what this implies. Unless the conception corresponds to a real agreement, it has a worse defect than that of not being clear: it is not applicable to the case at all. Among the phenomena, therefore, which we are attempting to connect by means of the conception, we must suppose <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> an agreement, and that the conception is a conception of that agreement. In order, then, that it may be clear, the only requisite is, that we shall know exactly in what the agreement consists; that it shall have been carefully observed, and accurately remembered. We are said not to have a clear conception of the resemblance among a set of objects, when we have only a general feeling that they resemble, without having analyzed their resemblance, or perceived in what points it consists, and fixed in our memory an exact recollection of those points. This want of clearness, or, as it may be otherwise called, this vagueness in the general conception, may be owing either to our having no accurate knowledge of the objects themselves, or merely to our not having carefully compared them. Thus a person may have no clear idea of a ship because he has never seen one, or because he remembers but little, and that faintly, of what he has seen. Or he may have a perfect knowledge and remembrance of many ships of various kinds, frigates among the rest, but he may have no clear but only a confused idea of a frigate, because he has never been told, and has not compared them sufficiently to have remarked and remembered, in what particular points a frigate differs from some other kind of ship.|$|E
