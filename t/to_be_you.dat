She appeared in the television movies Revenge of the Stepford Wives, No Other Love and A Fine Romance, and shot a television pilot. She also starred in several stage plays, including a play called It Had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>You</b> at a dinner theater in Canada, Particular Friendships in New York City in 1981, and Two for the Seesaw, directed by Burt Reynolds. Woody Allen first saw Kavner one night while he was watching Rhoda in the 1970s. He thought that she was remarkable and later offered her a role in his 1986 film Hannah and Her Sisters. Kavner agreed, and credits Allen and the film with rejuvenating her career.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} verse, Beyoncé {{continues}} to dismiss her former lover as she sings, [...] "So sad, you're hurt / boo hoo ...", over a tinkling piano riff and bass drums. She then chants the ascendant chorus, which this time features soaring strings and an uplifting aggressive piano accompaniment. Nadine Cheung of AOL Radio noted that though Beyoncé rips through the verses, she sings the chorus and bridge with restraint; on the latter, she affirms {{that she has}} moved on in life. The song ends as Beyoncé repeatedly sings, [...] "What goes around comes back around / I bet it sucks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>you</b> right now".|$|E

500|$|A pop and R ballad, the {{subjects}} of [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] are revenge and karma. Not wanting to feel broken-hearted, the female protagonist sings that she feels happy to have left her lover, who did not recognize {{the potential for a}} happy life with her. Some critics viewed it as a sequel to Beyoncé's 2006 single [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] as the two songs are thematically similar. However, some lyrics, including [...] "showed your ass" [...] and [...] "sucks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>you</b> right now", were criticized. The ballad was also likened to Vanessa Carlton's 2002 single [...] "A Thousand Miles" [...] (2002).|$|E
500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} about the {{breakdown}} of a relationship between Beyoncé and her lover, a situation that suits both of them. They also touch on revenge and karma, particularly the opening line, [...] "What goes around comes back around", the lines [...] "Best thing I never had", [...] "Best thing you never had", and the closing line, [...] "Sucks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>you</b> right now". Happy to have avoided heartbreak, Beyoncé continues to sing about her ex-lover, who did not recognize {{the possibility of a}} happy relationship with Beyoncé until the relationship broke down. Beyoncé no longer desires her lover after discovering his deceit; as shown in the pre-chorus and chorus lines, [...] "When I think of the time that I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you / Thank God you blew it, I thank God I dodged a bullet / I’m so over you, so baby good looking out / I wanted you bad / I’m so through with that / Because honestly / You {{turned out to be the}} best thing I never had / And will always be the best thing you never had." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] also {{received}} a few mixed and negative reviews. Amos Barshad of New York magazine wrote that the ballad borrows more heavily from Beyoncé's own 2006 single [...] "Irreplaceable", and that [...] " [...] can't be a bad thing". However, he noted that [...] "this time in language ('Sucks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>you</b> right now') agreeable to a nation of tweens and in a manner agreeable to anyone who likes yelping along in unison to ascendant pop choruses." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters wrote that lines like [...] "showed your ass" [...] and [...] "it must suck to be you" [...] exemplify lame lyrics. He concluded that, [...] " [...] are wondering how such lame lyrics could be sung with such earnestness." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that {{the most interesting thing}} about [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] is the curious image evoked by the chorus' lyric, noting that everything seemed fine until [...] "the protagonist's former amorata 'showed your ass'". Music Weeks Ben Cardew commented that its 1980s sound is [...] "not a highlight". A negative review came from Al Shipley of The Village Voice who wrote that [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and [...] "Party" [...] were [...] "among the album's worst and most unrepresentative songs".|$|E

500|$|Castiel {{typically}} displays {{very little}} emotion and always exhibits an extremely somber disposition. Although {{it has been}} suggested angels possibly do not possess the ability to truly feel emotion, Castiel frequently exhibits affection towards Dean. This attachment and growing ability to feel even causes him to be [...] "demoted", as his superiors fear emotions are clouding his judgment. Throughout his appearances in the fourth season, he also seems to, at the very least, come close to expressing regret, hesitance, and anger several times, and has once quietly laughed at a joke Dean made in [...] "It's the Great Pumpkin, Sam Winchester". Actor Misha Collins feels, through Dean, [...] " [...] learning a little bit about humanity and re-learning something about [...] own humanity from that exposure. So...there's a humanizing of Castiel going on." [...] Castiel begins having an internal struggle between what is right and what is wrong, and whether or not to obey orders from Heaven. Collins feels this is because interactions with Sam and Dean have made the angel [...] "uncertain" [...] and [...] "more fragile". Collins believes Castiel envies Dean's decisiveness and desires to emulate him. Having lost his connection to Heaven in the fifth season, Castiel's humanization seems to have quickened by the episode [...] "Free <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>You</b> and Me", as he appears extremely anxious while in a whorehouse, is visibly distraught when asking Dean for help, and refers to the Archangel Raphael as [...] "my little bitch". Despite becoming very arrogant when he becomes the [...] "new God", Castiel still shows his caring side and ultimately returns the souls to Purgatory and shows remorse for his actions, promising to Dean {{to find a way to}} redeem himself in Dean's eyes, showing that he cares about how Dean views him. After losing his memory, Castiel is more human than ever, but still displays some of his emotionless side. [...] After his memory returns, he shows real regret when he can't undo the damage he did to Sam and essentially sacrifices himself to save him out of remorse for his actions. After Castiel wakes up from his catatonic state, he is now depicted as insane with tendencies to ramble about random topics. [...] However, parts of Castiel's original personality are still shown with him still being happy to help Sam and Dean out and still knowledgeable about various supernatural things, but not willing to actually fight anymore even when his life is threatened. Castiel describes himself as [...] "bad luck" [...] and doesn't believe he should be around the Winchesters as a result. After traveling to Purgatory, Castiel regained his sanity, but still carries a lot of guilt about his previous actions. He is also now less distant from Sam and Dean and more appreciative of human things such as television.|$|E

Following this, Beyoncé sent Minaj a new version she wanted and told Minaj, [...] "I want you <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>you.</b> I don't want you to hold back.", according to the rapper. Minaj began writing the verse in New York and Beyoncé visited her in the studio, encouraging her. Beyoncé later revealed to Minaj that she would release the song sometime during her On the Run Tour. Following this both of the singers began sending each other photos of themselves to create the song's artwork.|$|E
2500|$|Although Liz {{is happy}} to be TGSs head writer, she envies Jenna {{achieving}} the performing career they both hoped for when working at Second City. Liz confesses to Jenna, [...] "there's still this sad little {{part of me that}} wants {{to be the center of}} attention ... that wants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>you,</b> I guess". Liz gets the chance to be on camera as host of Dealbreakers, but the pilot is a failure. Despite their frustrations and occasional rivalries, however, the show often reveals that the two women appreciate their friendship and do their best to be supportive of the other's careers. [...] When the phrase [...] "That's a deal breaker, ladies" [...] is coined by Jenna thanks to Liz's writing, Jenna surrenders the spotlight with a surprisingly short sulking period. [...] She later encourages Liz to write a book and take on a talk show gig based on the catch phrase (though the talk show is very short-lived).|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, Wilson met Tony Asher at a {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles. Asher {{was at the time}} a 26-year-old lyricist and copywriter working in jingles for an advertising agency. The two exchanged ideas for songs, and soon after, Wilson heard of Asher's writing abilities from mutual friends. In December 1965, he contacted Asher about a possible lyric collaboration, wanting to do something [...] "completely different" [...] with someone he had never written with before. Asher accepted the offer, and within ten days, they were writing together. Wilson played some of the music he had recently recorded and gave a cassette to Asher containing the backing track to a piece called [...] "In My Childhood". The result of Asher's tryout was eventually retitled [...] "You Still Believe in Me", and the success of the piece convinced Wilson that Asher was the wordsmith he had been looking for. When Wilson was asked why he felt Asher was the right collaborator: [...] "Oh, a lot of reasons. One, I thought he was a cool person. Two, anybody that hung out with [...] Loren Schwartz was a very brainy guy, a real verbal type person. I just felt that there was something there that had <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>you</b> know, that really had to be." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hip hop {{culture has}} spread to both urban and {{suburban}} communities throughout the United States and subsequently the world. These elements were adapted and developed considerably, particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the 1990s and subsequent decades. Even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms, including hip hop theater and hip hop film, the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hip hop culture. [...] Hip hop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon; the importance of sampling tracks, beats and basslines from old records [...] to the art form means {{that much of the}} culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings, attitudes, and experiences for modern audiences. Sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called [...] "flipping" [...] in hip hop culture. Hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier African-American-rooted musical genres such as blues, jazz, rag-time, funk, and disco {{to become one of the}} most practiced genres worldwide. It is the language of urban environments and the youth around the world, many who do not know what Hip Hop (the consciousness which makes up the collective culture of Hip Hop) is or what it means to [...] "Be Hip Hop" [...] , have recently begun to attribute being Hip Hop with being black, however that is race , not culture and not consciousness. as KRS-One says [...] "Hip Hop is the only place where you see Martin Luther King Jr. s; 'I have a dream speech' in real life" [...] and [...] "To be Hip Hop you have to have the courage <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>you</b> and be Hip Hop all the time not just when it's popular or convenient, and have repped it when it wasn't and you were the only one repping it." [...] He also notes that Hip Hop is beyond something as simple minded as race or gender or nationality, it belongs to the world.|$|E
