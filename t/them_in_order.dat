5|$|Beetle {{antennae}} {{are primarily}} organs of sensory perception and can detect motion, odour and chemical substances, {{but may also}} be used to physically feel a beetle's environment. Beetle families may use antennae in different ways. For example, when moving quickly, tiger beetles {{may not be able to}} see very well and instead hold their antennae rigidly in front of <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to avoid obstacles.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather dissipate <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to perform work or send a signal. Probably {{the most familiar}} and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons. All ion pumps {{have some sort of}} trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can be activated by binding a molecular agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of conquest, encomienda rights {{effectively}} meant rights to pillage and round up slaves, usually {{in the form of a}} group of mounted conquistadores launching a lightning slave raid upon an unsuspecting population centre. Prisoners would be branded as slaves, and taken to a port to be sold, in order that the conquistadores could purchase weapons, supplies, and horses. In some cases the conquistadores would round up the elders, chain them up, whip them and set their war dogs upon <b>them,</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to force the natives to hand over tribute such as food and clothing.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} Pokémon games, Diamond and Pearl chronicle {{the adventures}} of a young Pokémon trainer as he/she trains and battles Pokémon while also thwarting the schemes of a criminal organization. The games add many new features, such as Internet play over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and changes to battle mechanics and Pokémon Contests, along with addition of 107 new Pokémon. The games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and while both can be played separately, {{it is necessary to}} trade between <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to complete the games' Pokédexes.|$|E

Nevertheless, he requested that his brother, Joaquín Eulogio Estanislao Belgrano, who was appointed as his heir, should look after his newborn daughter.|$|E

5|$|Abramson was {{a leading}} {{architect}} of synagogue-centers at that time. He designed a number of New York examples, including the original synagogue-center, the Manhattan Jewish Center (1918), {{as well as the}} Brooklyn Jewish Center, the Flatbush Jewish Center, and the Ocean Parkway Jewish Center (all constructed in Brooklyn between 1920 and 1924). While the Flatbush Jewish Center has been completely remodeled, the Brooklyn and Ocean Parkway Jewish Centers are visually similar to the East Midwood Jewish Center, and the Brooklyn Jewish Center in particular has an identical layout. The written evidence consists of an entry in a souvenir journal commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the Flatbush Jewish Center, stating that Abramson drew East Midwood's plans. The NRHP nomination form speculates that Abramson drew the basic plans for the East Midwood Center, and that the Building Committee completed <b>them,</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to save money.|$|E
5|$|Al-Jamri {{has written}} two books in Arabic, Memories of Childhood (2007) and Interventions on Thought and Politics (2008). The former is a {{narrative}} of al-Jamri's childhood in Iraq, the experiences he had and the events he witnessed. He was motivated to write it by people's reactions {{following the death of}} his father and dedicated the book to his memory. The latter deals with political and ideological concepts in Europe and the Muslim world, and how Muslim countries can benefit from <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to consolidate the political pluralism within the Islamic theme. Al-Jamri also writes a daily column in Al-Wasat and regular articles on politics and human rights for other publications such as Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower 3 is a {{survival}} horror game played from a fixed third-person camera perspective in which players control 14-year-old school girl Alyssa Hamilton. Clock Tower 3 {{is the first}} game in the series to incorporate direct control over the protagonist, {{as opposed to the}} point-and-click gameplay used in the previous games. To progress through the game, the player must find items to unlock new areas, solve puzzles, and flee and hide from enemies ("Subordinates"). Eventually, each Subordinate must be defeated in battle. Throughout each level, the player also encounters the spirits of innocent people slain by the Subordinates. These spirits will attack Alyssa if she approaches <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>order</b> to pacify them, an item of sentimental value must be found and returned to the spirit's corpse.|$|E

5|$|Cosades inducts {{the player}} into the Blades on the Emperor's orders, {{and sets the}} player on various quests to uncover the mysterious disappearances and revelations that the {{citizens}} of Vvardenfell have experienced, particularly the Sixth House and the Ashlander prophecies of the Nerevarine. It is later revealed that the induction under Cosades, and the player's release from prison, {{was due to the}} Emperor's suspicion that the player might be the Nerevarine – a reincarnation of the legendary Dunmer hero Indoril Nerevar – or at least someone would make a convincing imposter to use for political gain. The PC is tasked with uncovering the prophecies regarding the Nerevarine, and to fulfil <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to finally defeat Dagoth Ur and his Sixth House cult.|$|E
5|$|Further {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} the Kuiper belt later emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been known for some time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their volatile surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually dispersing <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>order</b> for comets to continue to be visible over the age of the Solar System, they must be replenished frequently. One such area of replenishment is the Oort cloud, a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 AU from the Sun first hypothesised by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. The Oort cloud is thought to be the point of origin of long-period comets, which are those, like Hale–Bopp, with orbits lasting thousands of years.|$|E
5|$|Levels in {{the game}} include a mixture of platforming, {{swimming}} and on-rails levels. They are based around several returning themes including forests, cliff-sides, factories and mountain tops. The level design is more diverse compared to its predecessors, which includes more complex puzzles and obstacles. Every level has an enemy called a Koin; each of these enemies bears the DK Coin of their respective level, holding it as a shield. As these enemies always face towards the player, they must be defeated by throwing a steel barrel over them so it bounces off a wall behind <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to strike them from behind. The game overworld is also more complex, allowing players to explore between each area instead of forcing them along a linear path. To achieve this, the game includes several vehicles such as a speedboat and hovercraft {{which can be used}} to traverse the overworld and access different worlds.|$|E

5|$|Like other white-eyes, {{the golden}} white-eye is diurnal. In {{contrast}} to the bridled white-eye, which forages in groups and is not territorial, the golden white-eye occurs in pairs or small family groups consisting of a breeding pair and fledged young. The golden white-eye is also territorial, and pairs will sing throughout the day in response to neighbouring pairs. Groups can become aggressive when they encounter one another. The golden white-eye is also aggressive towards the smaller bridled white-eye, chasing it away from food and perches and flying through flocks of <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to disperse them. While it chases other forest passerines, it is less aggressive towards them, {{and in fact the}} rufous fantail seeks out the golden white-eye, foraging behind it to snatch insects flushed by the latter species. The golden white-eye is socially dominant over the bridled white-eyes and rufous fantails, but it is subordinate to the Micronesian myzomela and is chased by that species. It is also occasionally chased by the fantails if it approaches their nests too closely.|$|E
5|$|Shantae is a {{platform}} adventure game, in which players play as the eponymous Shantae, a half-genie who must travel across various areas {{in order to}} stop the evil lady pirate Risky Boots. Shantae's default attack involves using her hair like a whip. Shantae can also use gems obtained from defeated enemies to purchase items, such as life-restoring potions and damaging items with various uses, as well as learn upgraded combat moves. The game features five towns, with various areas filled with enemies and obstacles in between <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>order</b> to progress through the game, Shantae must seek out various characters who will open up dungeons, with each dungeon containing a guardian genie that will teach Shantae a new dance. By using these dances, Shantae can transform herself into different animals, including a monkey that can climb on walls, an elephant that can smash objects such as boulders and tree stumps, a spider that can climb across webbing in the background, and a harpy that can fly in mid-air. Shantae must use these abilities to reach new areas or find hidden items.|$|E

On 8 April, despite bad weather, Pattle led an attack on Petrich in Yugoslavia and left a number of enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground.|$|E
