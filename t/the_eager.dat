5|$|Another {{major change}} was {{the arrival of}} foods from the Americas in Early Modern times (around the sixteenth century), notably the {{incorporation}} of the potato into Northern European cuisine, and <b>the</b> <b>eager</b> adoption of the tomato into Mediterranean cuisine. The tomato, so central now to that cuisine, was first described in print by Pietro Andrea Mattioli in 1544. Similarly, many of the species of Phaseolus beans now used around the Mediterranean, including P. vulgaris (the French or haricot bean), were brought back from the Americas by Spanish and Portuguese explorers.|$|E
5|$|The other {{executives}} decide to produce Norville's invention {{in hopes that}} it will flop and depress the company's stock. The invention {{turns out to be}} the hula hoop, which initially fails but then turns into an enormous success. Norville allows success to go to his head and becomes yet another uncaring tycoon. Amy, who had fallen for his naive charm, is infuriated over Norville's new attitude and leaves him. Buzz, <b>the</b> <b>eager</b> elevator operator, pitches a new invention: the flexi-straw. Norville dismisses it and fires Buzz. Meanwhile, Aloysius, a Hudsucker janitor, discovers Amy's true identity and informs Mussburger. Mussburger reveals Amy's secret identity to Norville and tells him he will be dismissed as president after the new year. Mussburger also convinces the board that Norville is insane and must be sent to the local psychiatric hospital.|$|E

25|$|In 1288 Albert II {{applied at}} King Rudolph I for the {{enfeoffment}} {{of his son}} and heir Duke Rudolph I with the Palatinate of Saxony, which ensued a long lasting dispute with <b>the</b> <b>eager</b> clan of the House of Wettin. When the County of Brehna was reverted to the Empire after the extinction of its comital family the king enfeoffed Duke Rudolph. In 1290 Albert II gained the County of Brehna and in 1295 the County of Gommern for Saxony. King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia succeeded in bringing Albert II in favour of electing Adolf of Germany as new emperor: Albert II signed an elector pact on 29 November 1291 that he would vote the same as Wenceslaus. On 27 April 1292 Albert II, with his nephews still minor, wielded the Saxon electoral vote, electing Adolf of Germany.|$|E
60|$|A change came at last, when Dolly was {{ten years}} old.

25|$|Each {{party has}} two goals, {{ten or fifteen}} yards apart. The parties, ten or fifteen on a side, stand in line, facing each other at about ten yards’ {{distance}} midway between their goals and that of their adversaries. An indifferent spectator throws up a ball {{the size of a}} cricket ball midway between the confronted players and makes his escape. The rush is to catch the falling ball. He who first can catch or seize it speeds home, making his way through his opponents and aided by his own sidesmen. If caught and held or rather in danger of being held, for if caught with the ball in possession he loses a snotch, he throws the ball (he must in no case give it) to some less beleaguered friend more free and more in breath than himself, who if it be not arrested in its course or be jostled away by <b>the</b> <b>eager</b> and watchful adversaries, catches it; and he in like manner hastens homeward, in like manner pursued, annoyed and aided, winning the notch or snotch if he contrive to carry or throw it within the goals. At a loss and gain of a snotch a recommencement takes place.|$|E
500|$|The {{screenplay}} {{itself was}} written by Andrew Bergman, who also directed. According to one critic, the novel's plot is [...] "quite faithfully followed" [...] by the screenplay, but in bringing the complicated story to the screen, [...] "Bergman forgets to explain persuasively what a nice girl like Erin — smart, spunky and a former FBI employee — is doing in a dump called <b>the</b> <b>Eager</b> Beaver." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Clark, in Aces High: The War in the Air Over the Western Front, found Ball the [...] "perfect public schoolboy" [...] with [...] "the enthusiasms and all <b>the</b> <b>eager</b> {{intelligence}} of that breed" [...] {{and that these}} characteristics, coupled {{with a lack of}} worldly maturity, were [...] "the ingredients of a perfect killer, where a smooth transition can be made between the motives that drive a boy to 'play hard' at school and then to 'fight hard' against the King's enemies". Biographer Chaz Bowyer considered that [...] "to label Albert Ball a 'killer' would be to do him a grave injustice", as his [...] "sensitive nature suffered in immediate retrospect whenever he succeeded in combat".|$|E

500|$|The album's lyrics {{generally}} {{deal with}} themes of adult love, meaningful sex, and romance. Andrew Ryce from Pitchfork interprets its [...] "overarching theme" [...] to be [...] "the highly sexualized {{seen through the}} lens of <b>the</b> <b>eager</b> and innocent." [...] Miguel's lyrics express modesty, yearning, vulnerability, and cheeky humor. Kelley likens his songwriting to Tony! Toni! Toné! and observes [...] "Little Richard-level insinuations" [...] and [...] "absurd provocations in the style of Akinyele". Music journalist Jim DeRogatis views that Miguel eschews braggadocio and is [...] "man enough to admit his own insecurities and question whether he's worthy of love—or lustful indulgence." [...] Kaleidoscope Dream also explores the anxiety and momentary nature of sex and clubbing. Consequence of Sound's Jeremy D. Larson views that Miguel employs a [...] "fangs-out approach to R" [...] similar to Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, writing that [...] "nothing shrouds Miguel and his directives, and worries, and prayers, and cat calls– it's all there, full of light and love, refracting through a kaleidoscope of rocks glasses, rainy windshields, and blood-shot eyes." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{writing on}} her {{personality}} in [...] "Alice on the Stage" [...] (April 1887), Carroll described her as [...] "loving and gentle", [...] "courteous to all", [...] "trustful", and [...] "wildly curious, and with <b>the</b> <b>eager</b> enjoyment of Life that comes {{only in the}} happy hours of childhood, when all is new and fair, and when Sin and Sorrow are but names — empty words signifying nothing!" [...] Commentators characterise her as [...] "innocent", [...] "imaginative", introspective, generally well-mannered, critical of authority figures, and clever. Others see less positive traits in Alice, writing that she frequently shows unkindness in her conversations with the animals in Wonderland, takes violent action against the character Bill the Lizard by kicking him into the air, and reflects her social upbringing in her lack of sensitivity and impolite replies. According to Donald Rackin, [...] "In spite of her class- and time-bound prejudices, her frightened fretting and childish, abject tears, her priggishness and self-assured ignorance, her sometimes blatant hypocrisy, her general powerlessness and confusion, and her rather cowardly readiness to abandon her struggles {{at the ends of}} the two adventures— many readers still look up to Alice as a mythic embodiment of control, perseverance, bravery, and mature good sense." ...|$|E
500|$|The three cannot {{return to}} the present right away since the [...] "return pad" [...] to Stewie's time machine fails to activate. [...] They decide to go to England where Mort, who is Jewish, will be safe from the Nazis. While {{attempting}} to cross the border, German officers find out that Mort is Jewish (while doing a poor impersonation of a Catholic priest), resulting in their being chased by the Nazis. [...] Mort, Stewie and Brian make a getaway on a motorbike, followed by an elaborate undersea pursuit in a hijacked U-boat. The chase scene on the motorbike re-enacts the skateboard chase scene in Back To The Future. [...] Like Biff, the Nazi officers' car ends up slamming into a manure truck ("Das Poop!"). [...] The three make it to England safely, and see Winston Churchill. Stewie examines the return pad and discovers it has run out uranium fuel. [...] Brian states that the only place they can find the needed uranium in this time is at a [...] "secret" [...] nuclear testing facility in Berlin, Nazi Germany. The three join the Royal Air Force and fly a Lancaster bomber as they participate in a dogfight against a squadron of Luftwaffe Me-109 fighters, eventually reaching Berlin. After finding the nuclear research lab, Stewie disguises himself as Adolf Hitler, while the other two disguise themselves as Nazi Officers, and obtains the needed uranium. They then run into the real Hitler, who orders their execution, but they escape on the return pad back to their time (Hitler offered to spare them if they performed a charming musical number, but Mort cuts <b>the</b> <b>eager</b> Stewie and Brian off at the first line).|$|E

2500|$|Eddie Redmayne also {{received}} considerable praise for his performance with Bloomberg News saying that [...] "Eddie Redmayne—most recently seen as <b>the</b> <b>eager</b> young production assistant in My Week with Marilyn—delivers {{by far the}} most moving and memorable performance in the film as the young firebrand Marius, who, along with his fellow students, is caught up in France's political upheavals in the 19th century." ...|$|E

2500|$|Smart {{phones and}} social {{networking}} services {{enable us to}} stay connected continuously with people around us or far away from us, which however is sometimes the root of our anxiety in social life. <b>The</b> <b>eager</b> to know what everyone was saying and the tendency {{to see if anyone}} shared new things are typical [...] "symptoms" [...] of this anxiety called FoMO. There is a study that examined possible connections between FOMO and social media engagement indicating that FoMO was associated with lower need satisfaction, mood and life satisfaction.|$|E

Construction started in 1899, but the sharp winter slowed construction; Mrs. Oelrichs' sister had married William K. Vanderbilt II that winter season, {{and the house was}} required for parties in the following Newport season; <b>the</b> <b>eager</b> Mrs. Oelrichs moved in July 1900, sending the workmen out in order to give a first party in August, a dinner for one hundred and twelve to outdo Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish's Harvest Festival Ball at Crossways. Ferns and floral arrangements concealed the unfinished areas. The house was not completed until 1902.|$|E
2500|$|The message: [...] "Air Raid, Pearl Harbor. This is no drill" [...] came at 07:55 on 7 December 1941, as Japanese planes swept {{overhead}} in {{an attempt}} to cripple the Pacific Fleet. Taney, moored alongside Pier 6, Honolulu harbor, manned her anti-aircraft guns swiftly when word of the surprise attack reached her simultaneously. As no Japanese attacks were directed at Honolulu harbor, the Coast Guard cutter was only given the opportunity to fire at stray aircraft which happened to venture into her vicinity. She was firing upon unidentified aircraft as late as noon, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>eager</b> Coast Guardsmen were probably shooting at American planes—not Japanese. Coast Guardsmen from the Taney were ordered to take up defensive positions around Aloha Tower and protect it from being occupied.|$|E
2500|$|Tom Ewing of Pitchfork Media said, [...] "Lennon's {{anger and}} the band's rediscovery of rock 'n' roll mean For Sales {{reputation}} as the group's meanest album is deserved". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph commented that [...] "if this is a low point, they still sound fantastic", adding that [...] "the Beatlemania pop songs are of a high standard, {{even if they are}} becoming slightly generic." [...] Writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rob Sheffield said that the album contains some poor cover versions yet [...] "I'm a Loser" [...] and [...] "What You're Doing" [...] indicate that the band were continuing to progress. He added: [...] "The harmonies of 'Baby's in Black,' the hair-raising 'I still loooove her' climax of 'I Don't Want to Spoil the Party,' <b>the</b> <b>eager</b> hand claps in 'Eight Days a Week' – it all makes 'Mr. Moonlight' easy to forgive." ...|$|E
