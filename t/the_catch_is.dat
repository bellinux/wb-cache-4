25|$|Alaskan {{king crab}} fishing {{is carried out}} during the fall months in the waters {{off the coast of}} Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.

Large numbers of king crab are also caught in Russian and international waters.|$|E
25|$|Since 1832, the Faroe Islands {{have been}} divided into several whaling districts, {{although}} {{there is reason to}} believe that these districts already existed in some form prior to this date. These whaling districts are the basis for the distribution of the meat and blubber of the pilot whales caught. <b>The</b> <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> distributed in such a way that all the residents of the whaling district are given the same amount of the catch, regardless of whether they took part in the hunt or not.|$|E

25|$|The game ends {{after the}} snitch {{has been caught}} through what is called by a clean catch. <b>The</b> <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> {{determined}} by the Snitch Referee, The Head Referee, and the Snitch Runner. The team that caught the snitch is awarded 30 points, regardless if they are winning or losing the game. The winner is determined not by the snitch catch but {{by the number of}} points earned throughout the entirety of the game play. Depending on the score teams will delay the snitch catch in order to better their chances of winning. Teams that are losing will defend the snitch by placing themselves between the Snitch Runner and the opposing seeker.|$|E
25|$|George Leavitt Sr. died at Queen's Hospital in Honolulu on March 1, 1925. Today Oliver Leavitt, an Inupiaq {{descendant}} of Capt. Leavitt, continues to hunt whales in the Beaufort Sea, as did his ancestor. Each {{spring and fall}} Leavitt joins other Inupiaq in the whaling hunts. When the crew captures a bowhead whale, <b>the</b> <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> shared, as is the tribal custom, with the entire community. When not hunting whales, Oliver Leavitt, an Army veteran of the Vietnam War, helped oversee the investments of the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, set up by Congress in 1971 under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Leavitt helped lead the fight for the historic legislation in the 1970s. Leavitt lives in Barrow, where he volunteers for the Barrow Volunteer Search & Rescue.|$|E
25|$|Much of <b>the</b> <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> {{shrimp and}} sardines, with about three {{quarters}} exported to the United States. In 2002, the catch totaled 456,805 tons of seafood with {{a value of}} about 2,031 million pesos. In addition to what is caught at sea, there is active fish farming which raises mostly oysters and shrimp. Much of the commercial and sports fishing is essentially unregulated and has had a very pronounced impact on the Gulf of California, with commercially important species such as shrimp, groupers, snappers, corvinas, yellowtail, billfishes have been harvested well above sustainability. Two species which have been particularly hard hit are sharks and manta rays. In addition, shrimp trawling catches {{a large amount of}} non target species, which are discarded, and have destroyed large areas of the Gulf’s seafloor. All this has led to rapidly declining harvests.|$|E

The captains and crew members swap stories about the experiences and sights while fishing the Bering Sea. The spin-off series is produced in partnership with Original Productions and Silent Crow Arts. The first season aired in 2007, filmed at the Lockspot Cafe, a bar in Seattle Ballard neighborhood, hosted by Deadliest Catch narrator Mike Rowe. After the Catch II aired in 2008, filmed at Pratty's Bar in Gloucester, Massachusetts and hosted by Rowe. The third season, titled After the Catch III, aired in 2009 and was filmed at RTs Longboard Bar and Grill in San Diego with Cash Cab Ben Bailey hosting. After the Catch IV aired in 2010, and was filmed at the Blue Nile bar in New Orleans, with Rowe returning as host.|$|E
25|$|If {{the catch}} taken is {{pronounced}} or obvious, the players need not {{appeal to the}} umpire; the batsman normally chooses to acknowledge the dismissal himself. However, {{in the event that}} the ball brushes the edge of the bat, or <b>the</b> <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> taken very close to the ground, or the ball appears to have bounced off the batsman's foot (so it has not touched the ground), or the ball appearing to come off the bat very close to the pitch surface (bump ball), or if the batsman is reluctant to accept that he has been dismissed, the fielding team has to appeal to the umpire for this decision. In international competition, if neither field umpire can clearly decide if a catch has been made or not, they may refer to the third (television) umpire for a review. The third umpire may also be used if the Umpire Decision Review System is available and a team wishes to dispute a call concerning a possible catch.|$|E
25|$|The bitter {{rivalry between}} the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers {{has been going}} on since the 1970s. The NFL Top 10 ranked this rivalry to be the tenth best {{in the history of the}} NFL. San Francisco has played Dallas in seven postseason games. The Cowboys {{defeated}} the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC Championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC Championship Game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' Joe Montana complete a game-winning pass to Dwight Clark in the final minute (now known as <b>The</b> <b>Catch)</b> <b>is</b> one of the most famous games in NFL history. The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992–1994 seasons. San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC Championship Game three separate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers are second all time in Super Bowl victories to the Pittsburgh Steelers with five each. The 49ers-Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas. The all-time series is tied with a record of 17–17–1.|$|E

25|$|The stout whiting, Sillago robusta (also {{known as}} the yellow-cheek whiting and school whiting), is a species of benthic marine fish in the smelt-whiting family Sillaginidae. Like other sillaginids, it is an elongate, {{slightly}} compressed fish, growing to a maximum known length of 30 cm. The stout whiting is endemic to Australia, with the species divided into western and eastern populations, with the western population ranging from Shark Bay to Fremantle and the eastern population from Bustard Head, Queensland to northern New South Wales. The species inhabits deep, sandy continental shelf regions {{to a depth of}} at least 70 m. The stout whiting is a benthic carnivore, consuming a variety of polychaetes and crustaceans. The species grows rapidly, and sexual maturity is reached at a length of 13cm, with spawning occurring between December and March. Juveniles of the eastern population move to protected inshore waters, while those of the western population remain offshore their entire life. Stout whiting are the subject of a major export fishery operating out of southern Queensland {{and to a lesser extent}} New South Wales, with fishery authorities limiting the yearly catch to 1000 tonnes in Queensland. Most of <b>the</b> <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> exported frozen to a number of Asian countries, although small quantities are sold in Australia, with the net worth of the fishery values at around 3 million Australian dollars per year.|$|E
25|$|In the semi-finals India {{faced the}} English cricket team. Kapil helped curtail the lower-order after England lost regular wickets to Roger Binny and Mohinder Amarnath. He took 3 wickets as India limited England to 213 {{and the middle}} order of Mohinder Amarnath (46 runs), Yashpal Sharma (61), Sandeep Patil (51*) ensured victory and entry into the finals {{to take on the}} mighty West Indies cricket team who were looking for a hat-trick of World Cup titles. West Indies {{restricted}} India for 183 runs, with only Kris Srikkanth (38 runs) providing some scoring relief. Despite losing Gordon Greenidge, West Indies steadied their innings to 57/2 on the back of quick scoring by Viv Richards and looked comfortable. Richards played one too many aggressive shots when he skied a pull shot from Madan Lal that Kapil caught at deep square leg after running for over 20 yards running backwards. <b>The</b> <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> attributed as the turning point in the 1983 WC Final and is {{regarded as one of the}} finest in ODI Cricket. West Indies collapsed from 50/1 to 76/6 and finally were bowled out for 140 with Kapil picking up the wicket of Andy Roberts. Kapil Dev had upset Clive Lloyd's West Indies to win India's maiden World Cup and he led from the front with 303 runs (Average: 60.6), 12 wickets (Average: 20.41) and 7 catches in 8 matches – a truly all-round performance.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the fishing}} vessels used to capture M.challengeri are [...] long, with [...] "double or triple trawl rigs of low {{headline}} height". There is considerable variation in the catch per unit effort between different depths, between different geographical areas and between different years.

2500|$|Grasshoppers {{are known}} to use elastic energy storage to {{increase}} jumping distance. As noted above, power output is a principal determinant of jump distance, but physiological constraints limit muscle power to approximately 375 Watts per kilogram of muscle. To overcome this limitation, grasshoppers anchor their legs via an internal [...] "catch mechanism" [...] while their muscles stretch an elastic apodeme (similar to a vertebrate tendon). When <b>the</b> <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> released, the apodeme rapidly releases its energy. Because the apodeme releases energy more quickly than muscle, its power output exceeds that of the muscle that produced the energy.|$|E

[...] Royals outfielder Mitch Maier fouled back a pitch from Twins pitcher Brian Duensing. [...] The ball traveled over the protective net behind the home plate area.
