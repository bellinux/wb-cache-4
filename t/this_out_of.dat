As Rambabu, Jyothi and Anju are {{severely}} injured, Geetha's husband, Prabhakar, asks her {{to put a stop}} to <b>this.</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> fear, Anu reveals what she saw and Varun's friend describes the transgression at the camp. After digging up the compost pit, the police find the carcass of a pig instead of Varun's body, indicating that Rambabu had already moved it. Jyothi's brother, Rajesh, and her father call the media and Anu complains to them about Veerabhadram's ill-treatment of her family. After Veerabhadram manhandles Rambabu and his relatives, he is beaten by the local people who learn about him from the media. Rambabu's goodwill remains intact and all the locals extend their support to him. Veerabhadram is suspended, the remaining staff transferred, and Geetha resigns from her post as IG.|$|E

The consortium has rarely commented upon the profitability of the bridge, but during the structure's 10th anniversary, {{it was revealed that}} there had been a 30% cost overrun in construction ($330 million), The consortium is forced to cover <b>this</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> toll revenue since the federal government ferry subsidy is used to pay for the original tendered price ($1 billion). Operating costs for the bridge have also proven expensive, with warranty repairs for asphalt adherence and the complete replacement of all bridge deck lighting cutting into profits. Toll revenues have fallen over 30% since the bridge opened, largely because of declining tourism traffic and domestic travel and currently range from $25 to $30 million annually. After expenses in 2003, the consortium received a year-end dividend of $2.6 million.|$|E

500|$|Tom Noonan, {{who played}} killer Francis Dollarhyde, {{initially}} researched other serial killers {{to study for}} the role, but was repulsed by it.

[...] "I wanted to feel this guy was doing the best he could", Noonan explained, [...] "that he was doing <b>this</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> love". Noonan credits his casting to improvisation during his audition, recalling that he was reading lines alongside a young woman. During a reading of the scene featuring the torture of Freddy Lounds, Noonan noticed that the woman began to seem frightened, and deliberately tried to scare her more. He believed that this is what secured the role for him.|$|E

Thompson said that looking after Sol has [...] "taken a toll on [...] ". Although he initially feels optimistic about moving to Walford, he loses perspective and makes a mistake by sleeping with Naz. Thompson deemed <b>this</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> character for Asher, as he loves his brother so much, but opined that despite his mistakes, Asher is still a good brother: [...] "At heart, he's like anyone trying to do well.

Surprisingly, the Burmans managed to collect a full cup of tiny flies but it seemed impossible to find a takok plant that was 54 feet long. As fate, luck and destiny play important roles in our everyday lives, the Burmans at last found a 54-foot-long takok, {{on top of a}} huge dead jungle tree. They cut down the tree to get the takok and paid the final ransom for their anxious king. At last Pu Tong Seal released La King as a gesture of upholding his promise.|$|E
