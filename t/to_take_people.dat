There is no state law against public consumption of alcohol in other locations, but most municipalities have open container laws prohibiting or restricting public consumption. The fine for alcohol possession in a state park is $71, whereas municipal fines for public consumption violations can {{be as high as}} $2000, although they are generally much lower. Per the Alcoholism Treatment and Rehabilitation Act (ATRA), public intoxication without accompanying disorderly behavior is not a criminal offense, and municipalities are prohibited from making ordinances against public intoxication.

500|$|British {{comic book}} writer Paul Jenkins {{was drafted by}} Crystal Dynamics to help refine the game's script. Though Soul Reaver {{features}} a variety of boss encounters, Soul Reaver 2 does not; this was a conscious decision {{on the part of}} the staff, to ensure the game's pacing more closely emulated that of a novel or a film. While expanding the series' fiction, Hennig sought <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>people</b> back to the characters and mythology of the original Blood Omen, and built on its latent themes, including issues of fatalism, ethical dilemma and morality. In an interview, she stated that [...] "the game will have a proper ending this time", and said [...] "it has a conclusion. It's the end of a chapter. There won't be a cliffhanger". However, the story needed to be restructured several times before its completion, and, like the original Soul Reaver, many planned areas and abilities were excised, including three elemental forges (earth, water and spirit), more Reaver enhancements, and nine [...] "spell-type things". She explained that the project's small programming crew, its switch to the PlayStation 2, and its limited 17 month production schedule had forced the team to [...] "pick their battles", leading numerous features to be simplified or eliminated. Commenting on the final product, lead designer Richard Lemarchand said that Soul Reaver 2 [...] "fell short of what the team had wanted to accomplish. In particular, some puzzles were too opaque, the combat was rather one-dimensional, [...] ended without a decent resolution".|$|E

2500|$|The next 5 years {{witnessed}} numerous cases of intimidation, arson, torture {{and murder of}} the Haitian population by U.S. Marines and their local enforcers, the Gendarmerie d'Haiti. The U.S. Marines were instilled with a special brand of paternalism allowing them to behave this way. Mary Renda writes that [...] "paternalism was an assertion of authority, superiority, and control expressed in the metaphor of a father's relationship with his children." [...] This mindset allowed the marines to act highly authoritatively in Haiti and carry out atrocious acts. It {{has been estimated that}} up to 15,000 Haitians lost their lives {{at the hands of the}} occupying forces, either through armed opposition or through the 'corvee' system of forced labor. This system allowed the occupying forces <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>people</b> from their homes and farms, at gunpoint if necessary, to build roads, bridges, etc. Many resisted and were killed on the spot while others died working or due to disease and malnutrition while living in squalid work camps.|$|E

2500|$|The {{village of}} Georgetown in what {{later became the}} District of Columbia was founded in 1745.

Aquila Wheeler had a ferry there which he used <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>people</b> across the river to the Upper Marlboro Turnpike (now Pennsylvania Avenue SE). This ferry was known as the Upper Ferry, distinguishing it from the Lower Ferry (which ran from Barry's Wharf near the intersection of New Jersey Avenue SE and O Street SE across the Anacosita to Poplar Point). Wheeler died in 1796, and his widow, Elizabeth, operated the ferry until she was declared insane in 1799.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 April 2011 Mexican {{authorities}} found 59 {{bodies in}} eight clandestine mass graves in San Fernando, Tamaulipas.

2500|$|When Radio London {{closed down}} on 14 August 1967, John Peel joined the BBC's new pop music station, BBC Radio 1, which began {{broadcasting}} the following month.

At first he was obliged to share presentation duties with other DJs (Pete Drummond and Tommy Vance were among his co-hosts) but in February 1968 he was given sole charge of Top Gear; he continued to present the show until it ended in 1975.
