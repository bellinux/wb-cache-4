25|$|In {{in-vitro}} experiments THC at {{extremely high}} concentrations, {{which could not}} be reached with commonly consumed doses, caused competitive inhibition of the AChE enzyme and inhibition of β-amyloid peptide aggregation, implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Compared to currently approved drugs prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, THC is a considerably superior inhibitor of A aggregation, and <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>provides</b> a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism through which cannabinoid molecules may impact the progression of this debilitating disease.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} by Pedersen et al. indicates that TNFα increase {{in response to}} sepsis is inhibited by the exercise-induced production of myokines. To study whether acute exercise induces a true anti-inflammatory response, a model of ‘low grade inflammation’ was established in which a low dose of E. coli endotoxin was administered to healthy volunteers, who had been randomised to either rest or exercise prior to endotoxin administration. In resting subjects, endotoxin induced a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of TNFα. In contrast, when the subjects performed 3 hours of ergometer cycling and received the endotoxin bolus at 2.5 h, the TNFα response was totally blunted. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>provides</b> some evidence that acute exercise may inhibit TNF production.|$|E
25|$|Social {{behavior}} and wound healing: Oxytocin is also thought to modulate inflammation by decreasing certain cytokines. Thus, the increased release in oxytocin following positive social interactions {{has the potential}} to improve wound healing. A study by Marazziti and colleagues used heterosexual couples to investigate this possibility. They found increases in plasma oxytocin following a social interaction were correlated with faster wound healing. They hypothesized this was due to oxytocin reducing inflammation, thus allowing the wound to heal more quickly. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>provides</b> preliminary evidence that positive social interactions may directly influence aspects of health. According to a study published in 2014, silencing of oxytocin receptor interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of female mice resulted in loss of social interest in male mice during the sexually receptive phase of the estrous cycle. Oxytocin evokes feelings of contentment, reductions in anxiety, and feelings of calmness and security when in the company of the mate. This suggests oxytocin may be important for the inhibition of the brain regions associated with behavioral control, fear, and anxiety, thus allowing orgasm to occur. Research has also demonstrated that oxytocin can decrease anxiety and protect against stress, particularly in combination with social support.|$|E

50|$|Overall, <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>provides</b> solid {{research}} {{for which the}} previous findings regarding deindividuation can be solidified. The finding that deindividuation was associated with stronger group polarization and identification corresponds with the basis of deindividuation: individuals that are more polarized and identified with a group will be more apt to act out of character and display anti-normative behavior.|$|E
50|$|In Europe {{and parts}} of the U.S., a study has been {{conducted}} collecting DNA sequence data over a range of commonly encountered forensically important Calliphoridae species. One species observed was the C. mortuorum. This specimen was collected in Durham, UK. Flies used in this study were caught with liver-baited sticky traps. High quality DNA was extracted from these flies, and the genetic marker used in this study was the large sub-unit (lsu) ribosomal RNA gene. (This lsu rRNA gene has also been used in studies of evolutionary analysis of other organisms.) The DNA analysis collected in <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>provides</b> insight to different evolutionary patterns apparent in the Calliphoridae family, which can possibly provide a measure of the degree of genetic variation likely to be encountered within taxonomic groups of different forensic usefulness. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>provides</b> the first documented molecular based phylogenic analysis of the blowfly species. This research and more studies to come in the future will greatly assist the identification of larvae and adult insect species, which may play a great role in medicocriminal forensic entomology.|$|E

They reported statistically significant differences in mRNA for genes specific to production of actin. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>provides</b> evidence of the mechanisms for both immediate and delayed myofilament response to exercise at the molecular level.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{in a study}} {{conducted}} by Spindler et al., KRAS/BRAF mutations from plasma samples were monitored in 108 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer before and after cycles of the chemotherapeutic drugs cetuximab and irinotecan. The concentration of KRAS mutations from plasma samples decreased with successive cycles of treatment, and loss of detectable mutations was associated with treatment benefit. Remarkably, researchers also observed the appearance of new mutations, which may be representative of acquired resistance. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>provides</b> evidence that ctDNA may be a suitable biomarker for monitoring colorectal cancer progression.|$|E
