40|$|At present {{chemical}} {{sources of}} electricity {{are used as}} power supplies for low-powered electronic equipment. Despite continuous quality improvement (CQI) of chemical sources of electricity they still have some critical faults, such as: relatively high specific overall dimensions, presence of self-discharge, short life and limited shelf life under low temperature storage. Moreover, the chemical source of electricity production is power-consuming, costly and environmentally harmful. The plurality of facts given above stipulates the search for new sources of electric energy eliminating the faults chemical ones possess. Therefore, thermoelectric power supply sources are especially prospective in this respect as thermoelectric generators in general have a long operational life, they are reliable for use in extreme conditions and do not need being changed periodically.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this chapter is the {{presentation}} of micro and nanodevices for <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>converters.</b> Examples of applications for these converters are (1) in the conversion of electrical energy from temperature gradients and (2) in cooling devices. These converters are of solid-state type and use pairs of thermoelectric pand n-type materials, which were obtained by thin-films depositions.

The materials selected to serve as p- and n-type structures were the antimony telluride (Sb 2 Te 3) and the bismuth telluride (Bi 2 Te 3).
