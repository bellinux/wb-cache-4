40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{evidence that}} when an analyst makes an out-of-consensus forecast of a company’s quarterly earnings {{that turns out}} to be incorrect, she escalates her commitment to maintaining an out-ofconsensus view on the company. Relative to an analyst who was close to the consensus, the out-of-consensus analyst adjusts her forecasts for <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>year’s</b> earnings less in the direction of the quarterly earnings surprise. On average, this type of updating behavior reduces forecasting accuracy, so it does not seem to reflect superior private information. Further empirical results suggest that analysts do not have financial incentives to stand by extreme stock calls in the face of contradictory evidence.

Large organizations {{suffer from the}} problem of insufficient resources to complete all project requests submitted throughout the year. With the high volume of project requests received and the limited resources available, picking those projects to fund that return the highest value to the organization can be a daunting task. The purpose {{of this research is}} to help management make an optimal decision, and determine whether the introduction of an Excel-based optimization model would benefit an organization in its selection process. This research focuses on the project selection process for the Department of Public Works for the Presidio of Monterey Army instillations in the Monterey area.

This demonstrates how analytical tools, specifically an optimization model, can add value to an organization by increasing the number of projects selected.

Therefore, this research recommends that the optimization model be used, but only as a non-biased opinion on which projects should be selected. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R

60|$|The {{report of}} the Secretary of the Treasury, which by law is made {{directly}} to Congress, and forms no part of this message, will show the receipts and expenditures of the Government for the last fiscal year, the amount received from each source of revenue, and the amount paid out {{for each of the}} Departments of Government. It will be observed from this report that the amount of receipts over expenditures has been but $2,344,882.30 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1874, and that for <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>year</b> the estimated receipts over expenditures will not much exceed $9,000,000. In view of the large national debt existing and the obligation to add 1 per cent per annum to the sinking fund, a sum amounting now to over $34,000,000 per annum, I submit whether revenues should not be increased or expenditures diminished to reach this amount of surplus. Not to provide for the sinking fund is a partial failure to comply with the contracts and obligations of the Government. At the last session of Congress a very considerable reduction was made in rates of taxation and in the number of articles submitted to taxation; the question may well be asked, whether or not, in some instances, unwisely. In connection with this subject, too, I venture the opinion that the means of collecting the revenue, especially from imports, have been so embarrassed by legislation as to make it questionable whether or not large amounts are not lost by failure to collect, to the direct loss of the Treasury and to the prejudice of the interests of honest importers and taxpayers.|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In 2010, the Department of Defense (DOD) estimated that corrosion costs the DOD over $ 22. 9 billion annually. Corrosion negatively affects all military assets, including both equipment and infrastructure, and {{is defined as the}} unintended destruction or deterioration of a material due to its interaction with the environment. Corrosion also affects military readiness, taking critical systems out of action and creating safety hazards. Congress has enacted several legislative requirements to address the high cost of corrosion on military equipment and infrastructure, including legislation that created the Office of Corrosion Policy and Oversight (Corrosion Office) within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. The Corrosion Office is responsible for the prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military equipment and infrastructure and, according to officials, manages funding for DOD-wide corrosion prevention and control (CPC) activities and CPC projects proposed by the Military Departments. Section 2228 (e) of Title 10 of the United States Code requires DOD to annually report on CPC funding to Congress. Additionally, the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Year</b> 2009 required each Military Department's corrosion control and prevention executive to submit an annual report with recommendations pertaining to his or her Department's CPC program, including corrosion-related funding levels to carry out all of the duties of the executive. In <b>fiscal</b> <b>year</b> (FY) 2011, Congress expanded the requirement for DOD to report on its CPC efforts by adding to or revising existing elements. Section 2228 (e), as recently amended, requires DOD to annually submit a report to Congress on corrosion funding as part of its annual budget submission. In the report, DOD is to address funding requirements for its long-term corrosion reduction strategy, the return on investment (ROI) that would be achieved by implementing <b>the</b> strategy, <b>the</b> <b>current</b> and previous <b>fiscal</b> <b>year</b> funds requested in the budget compared to funding requirements, an explanation if funding requirements are not fully funded in the budget, and <b>the</b> <b>current</b> and previous <b>fiscal</b> <b>year</b> amount of funds requested in the budget for each project or activity described in its long-term strategy compared to the funding requirements for the project or activity.

Accordingly, our objectives were to: (1) {{determine the extent to which}} DOD's corrosion report addressed the mandated requirements, (2) assess the extent to which the CPC budget request met total estimated CPC funding requirements for activities and preliminary project proposals as stated in the FY 2012 DOD corrosion report, and (3) calculate the potential cost avoidance for DOD's CPC budget request and reported budget shortfall identified in the FY 2012 DOD corrosion report. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{examination}} {{of the history of}} budget reform in the United States indicates a perpetual tug of war between the executive and legislative branches of government for power. But surprisingly, in spite of this highly charged political process, there exists a consistent and common thread of concern for improving government performance and a desire to inject more “rationality” (measurement and evaluation) into budgeting decisions. In the past century, U. S. federal budget reforms have been centralizing (the Budget Act of 1921), activity-based (performance budgeting of the 1950 s), focused on program evaluation (PPBS in the 1960 s), management-oriented (MBO in the early 1970 s), bottom-up (ZBB in the mid- 1970 s), draconian (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings of the 1980 s), and concerned with results (GPRA in the 1990 s). Unfortunately, establishing a direct link between and among performance measurement, program evaluation and final appropriations remains elusive. In the U. S. today, the stakes have become too significant and entrenched. The sheer size of the U. S. federal budget as well as the dramatic change in the nature of federal expenditures (from predominantly supporting government administration to funding transfer payments to individuals) ups the ante of the politics of the public budgeting process. Perhaps more importantly, the overwhelming U. S. federal deficit and debt simply overshadow consideration of performance as the President and Congress mull over literally billions of dollars in cuts to <b>the</b> <b>current</b> and next <b>fiscal</b> <b>year</b> budgets. ...|$|R

This means the states are spending less than two cents of every dollar in tobacco revenue to fight tobacco use. States have failed to reverse deep cuts that reduced tobacco prevention funding by 36 percent, or $ 260. 5 million, from FY 2008 to FY 2012. The $ 459. 5 million the states have allocated this year represents essentially flat funding compared to the $ 456. 7 budgeted in FY 2012.
