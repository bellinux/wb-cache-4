5|$|The {{predominant}} club colours {{are green}} and white, {{which have been}} used since {{the formation of the}} club in 1875. The strip typically has a green body, white sleeves and a white collar. The shorts are normally white, although green has been used in recent seasons. <b>The</b> <b>socks</b> are green, usually with some white detail. Hibs have used yellow, purple, black, white and a dark green in recent seasons for their alternate kits. In 1977, Hibs became the first club in Scotland to bear sponsorship on their shirts. This arrangement prompted television companies to threaten a boycott of Hibs games if they used the sponsored kit, which resulted in the club using an alternate kit for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The club is {{associated}} with two very different colour schemes—white and black (first permanently adopted in 1920), and orange, navy and white (first used in 1973, and worn by the team as of the 2015–16 season). Luton mainly wore a combination of light blue and white before 1920, when white shirts and black shorts were first adopted. These colours were retained for over half a century, with the colour of <b>the</b> <b>socks</b> varying between white and black, until Luton changed to orange, navy and white {{at the start of}} the 1973–74 season. Luton began playing in white shirts, shorts and socks in 1979, with the orange and navy motif reduced to trim; navy shorts were adopted in 1984. This palette was retained until the 1999–2000 season, when the team played in orange shirts and blue shorts. From 2000 to 2008, Luton returned to white shirts and black shorts; orange was included as trim until 2007. The white, navy and orange palette favoured in the 1980s was brought back in 2008, following the results of a club poll, but a year later the colours were changed yet again, this time to a predominantly orange strip with white shorts. Navy shorts were readopted in 2011. Luton are wearing orange shirts, navy shorts and white socks during the 2015–16 season.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> dousing <b>sock,</b> [...] "spinnaker sleeve", snuffer, or just sock, is {{a device}} {{used to make}} {{deploying}} and retrieving the spinnaker a much easier task. <b>The</b> <b>sock</b> is a long fabric tube with a ring in one end to hold it open. Since the spinnaker is stored in <b>the</b> <b>sock,</b> <b>the</b> {{first step is to}} set up <b>the</b> <b>sock.</b> Two lines are attached to the sock; one is attached to a bridle on the ring, for pulling <b>the</b> <b>sock</b> down, and one is up the inside, from the ring, through the top, and back down, for raising the sock; these lines may be two ends of the same line, to form a loop. The head of the spinnaker is attached the top of <b>the</b> <b>sock</b> and <b>the</b> ring runs down to the tack. The resulting bundle is stuffed into the spinnaker bag. The top of <b>the</b> <b>sock</b> will have provisions for attaching to the spinnaker halyard.|$|R
50|$|The {{spinnaker}} {{is raised}} as normal, but with <b>the</b> <b>sock</b> in place <b>the</b> spinnaker {{is unable to}} catch the wind. Once the spinnaker is raised and the guys are ready to set, <b>the</b> <b>sock</b> is raised, releasing <b>the</b> spinnaker. <b>The</b> <b>sock</b> remains bundled up {{at the head of}} the sail while the spinnaker is deployed. To retrieve the spinnaker, the sheet or the tack is released and <b>the</b> <b>sock</b> is pulled down, gathering the sail. The halyard is then dropped and the sail may be packed away.|$|R
25|$|The women {{forced to}} work at Ravensbrück {{concentration}} camp's industries used their skills in sewing and their access to the factory to make soldiers' socks. They purposely adjusted the machines to make the fabric thin at the heel and the toe, which made <b>the</b> <b>socks</b> easily broken when the German soldiers marched. This gave the soldiers sore feet (ref).|$|E
25|$|From 1980 to 1988, the Kings {{modified}} {{their uniforms}} {{to include a}} contrasting yoke that extends from sleeve to sleeve. White was also added to <b>the</b> <b>socks,</b> on the tail stripes, and {{at the bottom of}} the yoke, but the color was removed from the pants. The names and numbers were also modified to a standard NHL block lettering.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the new 1912–13 Southern League Division One season, Portsmouth changed to a 'new' military-looking theme of navy blue shirts, white shorts and black socks. This was to become Portsmouth's home strip colour {{combination}} until {{the start of}} the 1947–48 season, when <b>the</b> <b>socks</b> were changed to red; this coincided with the club's most successful period and has remained the favoured colours {{for the majority of the}} time since.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} years the club had two kits, one with blue and white {{horizontally}} striped jerseys and white shorts, and a red kit in the same fashion. These were used interchangeably up until at least 1906. It is unclear exactly when the current kit was adopted, {{but it was in}} use by the time Lyn had claimed their first Norwegian Cup in 1908. <b>The</b> <b>socks</b> have traditionally been red. White socks have also been used, most recently {{from the beginning of the}} 1990s until 2004, when the red socks were brought back.|$|E
25|$|The modern uniform {{was first}} issued {{at the start}} of the 1999 season. The overshirt was changed to the grey base with red piping and sleeves {{shortened}} so the undershirt was visible and pants were changed to grey with red piping. Also <b>the</b> <b>socks</b> changed to a plain red. The cap changed slight as the 'P' was thinned, giving a more stylistic look. In the 2002–2003 season, the Major A team wore a black undershirt and socks, as well as a black with red brimmed cap instead of the traditional red for night games played on a Friday night. The night uniform was scrapped by 2004 and the singular uniform for all senior teams returned.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Hearts football strip was {{all white}} shirts and trousers with maroon trimmings, and a heart sewn onto the chest. For one season they played in red, {{white and blue}} stripes. These were the colours of a club called St. Andrew, who had taken their name and colours from the University of St Andrews, that Hearts had absorbed. Since then the predominant club colours have been maroon and white. The strip typically has a maroon top and a white collar, although the strip was predominantly white in the 2010–11 season. The shorts are normally white, although maroon {{was used in the}} 2008–09 season. <b>The</b> <b>socks</b> are normally maroon with some white detail.|$|E

25|$|The club colours of Rangers F.C. are royal blue, {{white and}} red. However, for the {{majority}} of the first forty-eight years of Rangers existence the club played in a plain lighter blue home shirt. The only deviation from this was a four-season period from 1879 when the side wore the lighter shade of blue and white in a hooped style. Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. Rangers moved from the lighter shade of blue to royal blue in 1921, and have had a royal blue home shirt every year since. Black socks were first included in 1883 for five seasons before disappearing for eight years but became a more permanent fixture from 1896 onwards. When the red turn-downs were added to <b>the</b> <b>socks</b> in 1904, the strip began to look more like the modern day Rangers home kit. Occasionally the home kit will be altered by the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks.|$|E
25|$|For the 1998–99 season, the Kings {{unveiled}} new logos, {{uniforms and}} color scheme, restoring the purple – albeit a lighter shade compared to Forum Blue – as grey and black had become associated with gang colors. The new primary logo was a shield and crest featuring three royal symbols, a lion, a crown and the Sun. The jerseys featured the shield logo with hints of purple on the yoke, sleeve stripes and tail. By coincidence, {{this was the}} same color scheme as the NBA's Sacramento team which is also called the Kings. The bottom of the jerseys read the city name. A purple alternate jersey featuring the updated secondary crown logo was unveiled for the 1999–2000 season. In 2002, the crown logo became the primary while the shield logo was demoted to alternate status. <b>The</b> <b>socks</b> on the black and purple uniforms also switched designations to match their counterparts. Upon moving to the Reebok Edge design in 2007, the jerseys were updated without the tail stripes. The purple-tinged road jerseys were used until the 2010–11 season, while the home jersey was demoted to alternate status in 2011 and remained in use until 2013.|$|E

500|$|The current, 2016-17, England strip {{is made by}} Canterbury. It {{features}} {{plain white}} shorts and a plain white shirt featuring an embossed St. George's Cross pattern on the chest and upper back. The crest is 3D injection moulded on a raised pouch, and a new redesigned deconstructed neckline. [...] The current alternative kit is dark sapphire and features the same embossed St. George's Cross but in red, Shorts are also dark sapphire. Home socks are midnight blue with a white top and this is reversed for the alternative socks. In 2013-14, the strip featured plain white shorts and a plain white shirt, but with an added black stripe on each sleeve. The alternative kit had a red and white striped shirt, with blue shorts.In 2014/15, the home shirt was white, with a [...] "V-Neck" [...] around the collar. The kit also had little Victoria Crosses on the main chest. It also had the O2 sponsorship marking on the chest. The shorts were plain white with the sponsorship marking on them. <b>The</b> <b>socks</b> were dark blue and had a white stripe at the top. The alternate shirt was exactly the same but was red instead of white. The shorts were navy blue and <b>the</b> <b>socks</b> were red with a white stripe on top. The 2015/16 strip was similar but didn't have the small crosses on the shirt. The Canterbury logo was straight and not diagonal it had white lines going horizontally across the chest. For the 2015 Rugby World Cup, the kit remained the same just with the Rugby World Cup logo {{on the right and}} no O2 logo in the centre. For the home strip, the shorts and socks remained the same. The away 2015/16 strip and World Cup strip was red, with dark red and maroon sleeves. The shorts were maroon and <b>the</b> <b>socks</b> were red with a maroon stripe on top.|$|E

500|$|Another Michigan {{writer from}} SB Nation {{described}} {{the film as}} thorough {{in its ability to}} provide the viewer with the answers to natural intrigues such as: [...] "How was the recruiting class assembled? Who pushed for the baggy shorts? The black socks? How did a stodgy University of Michigan culture react to this bold, brash and outspoken team?" [...] Other columnists were also satisfied to learn that Rose came up with the shorts and Jackson came up with <b>the</b> <b>socks.</b> He also commended the film on its detail surrounding Chris Webber's infamous timeout in the 1993 NCAA championship. The same reviewer enumerated his five biggest omissions from the film: Michigan athletic director Bill Martin, 1991–92 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team, 1992–93 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team, Michael Talley and Webber. He was also critical of Mitch Albom's involvement with the Fab Five.|$|E

500|$|As Quartermaster, Foster {{attempted}} to secure supplies from every source. In December 1862, according to University of Georgia professor and historian Kenneth Coleman, Foster [...] "appealed to every {{woman in the}} state of Georgia to send him a pair of socks for the army." [...] Another notable effort was the campaign to secure 50,000 socks from organizations such as the [...] "Young Ladies' Patriotic Society" [...] (pledging one garment a week from each member) as well as from individual girls and women of Georgia. In October 1863, Foster placed announcements in newspapers throughout the state, asking for contributions. He pledged to make available an ample supply of yarn, for those knitters willing to undertake the task, but lacking in material. Foster also asked them to attach their names to their work, so that a complete and detailed record could be maintained of each contribution and contributor.

500|$|The new {{script was}} then pitched to the BBC. The pitch tape they made {{was based on}} the same pitch used by The Muppet Show. This was done as a tribute to it, with Miller arguing that when The Muppet Show did it, [...] "it just must have just knocked <b>the</b> <b>socks</b> off the people who saw it, because it's like nothing you've ever seen before, and we thought: 'Why fix what ain't broke, so we did our own very British version of that." [...] The {{producers}} liked it but did not fully understand what the show was about. Miller, Brown and a third writer, Daniel Peak began to write scripts over a period of four years. A pilot was eventually filmed and the BBC commissioned a full series, targeted at adults. Despite the adult nature, Miller did not want to make the show too crude. Eight episodes were filmed so as to spread the cost of making the series over each episode.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{variously}} {{described his}} writing as [...] "forthright," [...] "chatty", and [...] "charming". In a review in The Globe and Mail Brian Brett admires [...] "Suzuki's disarming candour" [...] and labels it [...] "a strange, fascinating book". While Brett's review is positive, {{he calls it}} [...] "clunkily written" [...] and sometimes repetitive. The Edmonton Journal review notes that Suzuki could [...] "charm <b>the</b> <b>socks</b> off the most hardened soul", but {{that many of his}} stories fall flat. The review in the Quill & Quire notes Suzuki [...] "has not written an indulgent autobiography" [...] and that he [...] "is too polite to dish on his enemies". Writing for The Vancouver Sun, Robert Wiersema states that while [...] "his life is an open book... ou get the sense of meeting the real Suzuki for the first time." [...] Wiersema calls him [...] "a natural storyteller". The New Zealand Listener review states, [...] "as a writer, he has the charm of a high-school geek desperately trying to get a date... but ultimately it's what allows his story to convince". Several critics find Suzuki's writing on death to be particularly well-done.|$|E
