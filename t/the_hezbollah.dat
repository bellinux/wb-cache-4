5|$|Argentina {{suffered}} {{a terrorist attack}} in 1994, the AMIA bombing targeting a Buenos Aires Jewish center, that killed 85 people and wounded 300. The investigation remained open for years, and prosecutor Alberto Nisman {{was appointed to the}} case. He accused Iran of organizing the attack, and <b>the</b> <b>Hezbollah</b> group of carrying it out. He intended to prosecute five Iranian officials, including former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, but Argentina signed a memorandum of understanding with Iran for a joint investigation. Nisman accused the president of signing that memorandum for oil and trade benefits, according to hundreds of hours of wiretaps. On 19 January 2015 he was found dead at his home, a day before a congressional hearing to explain his accusation, which caused a great controversy. As of 2016, both the cases of the AMIA bombing and the death of Nisman remain unresolved, and the courts declined at the time to investigate his denunciation of Kirchner.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} tactics used by <b>the</b> Turkish <b>Hezbollah</b> to recruit college students into joining their terrorist organization. This study {{based on the}} assumptions that social networks and institutional structures are two main tools that are used effectively by <b>the</b> Turkish <b>Hezbollah</b> to recruit college educated students. In this sense, the researcher claims that Social Learning theory and Social Control Theories {{can be used to}} provide theoretical explanation to <b>the</b> <b>Hezbollah’s</b> recruitment strategy. Parallel to these theories assumptions, while having militants within social networks increases the likelihood of being recruited through social learning theory assumptions, college students who are away from their families {{are more likely to be}} recruited through social control theory assumptions. The researcher uses individual level secondary data related to members of <b>the</b> Turkish <b>Hezbollah.</b> <b>The</b> data comprised of self reports that each member submitted to <b>the</b> Turkish <b>Hezbollah</b> as part of their recruitment process. The data are derived from the Turkish National Police’s database. Initially, frequency table is used to determine which structure and which theory best explain <b>the</b> Turkish <b>Hezbollah’s</b> recruitment strategies. Then, to decide which demographic factors increase or decrease the likelihood of being recruited through social networks (social learning theory) or institutional structures (social control theory), logistic regression is used. Eight independent variables are used {{to identify}} those factors such as having Hezbollah militants within social networks, pursuing college education while being away from family, family’s religious ideology, having online or campus education, family size, income level, college student’s religiosity level, and reason for attending <b>Hezbollah.</b> <b>The</b> findings indicated that social networks and institutional structures are two important tools that are used by <b>the</b> Turkish <b>Hezbollah.</b> Social networks are more effectively used structures comparing to institutional structures.
