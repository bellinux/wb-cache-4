50|$|Early screw-propelled steamships used a {{thrust block}} or thrust box {{composed}} of perhaps a dozen lower-rated plain thrust journal bearings stacked {{on the same}} shaft. These were problematic in service: they were bulky, difficult to dismantle, wasted power through friction {{and they had a}} tendency to overheat. The thrust box was built of a box-like cast iron housing with a radial bearing at each end and a number of collars formed on the shaft between them. This shaft was often a short section of removable shaft called the <b>thrust</b> <b>shaft,</b> linking the engine ahead to the propeller shaft astern. A series of iron horseshoe-shaped collars fitted over the small diameter of the shaft and bore against the forward face of the shaft's collars. Each horseshoe was faced with a low-friction pad of babbitt metal. Lubrication was by an oil bath in the box and a plentiful volume was important for cooling purposes too.|$|E

However, {{there is no}} proper selection of test bed available for the performance evaluation, testing {{and analysis of the}} UAV propulsion system. This project has two major objectives which are to design and fabricate a test bed for the UAV propulsion system and to conduct detail performance experimentations of the UAV propulsion system run at various speed. In this study, test bed model is designed to test the nitro engine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) which is model of Thunder Tiger Pro 36 Engine Series of aircraft performance. In addition, six performance parameters are recorded for testing of the engine performance, which are <b>Thrust,</b> <b>shaft</b> brake power, available power, propulsive efficiency, specific fuel consumption and thrust coefficient. Furthermore, the method used in this project is to identify the unknown variables in parameters by using some sensors. The results show that the fabricated test bed can be used to study the engine performance. Specifically, performance parameters are directly proportional to the engine speed. These results show that the performance parameters are increasing along with the speed. In conclusion, the fabricated test bed can be used for the testing of engine performance analysis. Outcomes of this experiment can be successful by using the test bed because it helps to reduce the cost and time for UAV propulsion performances testing...|$|E
40|$|Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) {{equations}} with blade blockage and blade force {{source terms}} are solved in the meridional plane of complete axial flow turbomachinery using a finite-volume scheme. The equations of the compressible actuator disk (AD) {{are introduced to}} modify {{the evaluation of the}} convective fluxes at the leading and trailing edges (LEs and TEs). An AD behaves as a compact blade force which instantaneously turns the flow with no production of unphysical entropy. This avoids unphysical incidence loss across the LE discontinuity and allows for application of all of the desired deviation at the TE. Unlike previous treatments, the model needs no handmade modification of the throughflow (TF) surface and does not discriminate between inviscid and viscous meridional flows, which allows for coping with strong incidence gradients through the annulus wall boundary layers and with secondary deviation. This paper derives a generalized blade force term that includes the contribution of the LE and TE ADs in the divergence form of the TF equations and leads to generalized definitions of blade load, blade <b>thrust,</b> <b>shaft</b> torque, and shaft power. In analyzing a linear flat plate cascade with an incidence of 32 deg and a deviation of 21 deg, the proposed model provided a 105 reduction of unphysical total pressure loss compared to the numerical solution with no modeling. The computed mass flow rate, blade load, and blade thrust showed excellent agreement with the theoretical values. The complete RANS TF solver was used to analyze a four-stage turbine in design and off-design conditions with a spanwise-averaged incidence of up to 2 deg and 43 deg, respectively. Compared to a traditional streamline curvature solution, the RANS solution with incidence and deviation modeling provided a 0. 1 to 0. 7 % accurate prediction of mass flow rate, shaft power, total pressure ratio, and adiabatic efficiency in both the operating conditions. It also stressed satisfactory agreement concerning the spanwise distributions of flow angle and Mach number at LEs and TEs. In particular, secondary deviation was effectively predicted. The RANS solution with no modeling showed acceptable performance prediction only in design conditions and could introduce no deviation...|$|E

The main focus {{of this paper is}} to develop a framework for analyzing ice loads on a propeller blade using probabilistic methods based on experimental results. The Poisson distribution is used for the events of the propeller-ice interactions and the cumulative density function for extreme ice loads is modeled by a double exponential form (Gumbel Type).

Three configurations were tested: (1) empty tunnel; (2) test stand body (fuselage) and support system; and (3) fuselage and support system with rotor installed. Empty tunnel wall pressure data are evaluated as a function of tunnel speed to understand the baseline characteristics. Aerodynamic interaction effects between the fuselage and the walls of the tunnel are investigated by comparing wall, ceiling, and floor pressures for various tunnel velocities and fuselage angles-of-attack. Aerodynamic interaction effects between the rotor and the walls of the tunnel are also investigated by comparing wall, ceiling, and floor pressures for various rotor <b>shaft</b> angles, rotor <b>thrust</b> conditions, and tunnel velocities.
