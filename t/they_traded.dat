A qualitative study involving extensive literature search and case studies are used to inform this study. The findings indicate a lack of a theoretical framework to explain internationalisation by SBEs. Most {{of the literature on}} internationalisation is based on large corporations. As new opportunities are unfolding for some SBEs, many find differences in cultures/ languages /and business practices, finding reliable business partners, getting paid promptly and fluctuating exchange rates as big challenges as <b>they</b> <b>trade</b> overseas.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} trading {{activity}} of the mutual fund industry from 1975 through 1994 to determine whether funds “herd ” when <b>they</b> <b>trade</b> stocks and to investigate the impact of herding on stock prices. Although we find little herding by mutual funds in the average stock, we find much higher levels in trades of small stocks and in trading by growth-oriented funds. Stocks that herds buy outperform stocks that they sell by 4 percent during the following six months; this return difference is much more pronounced among small stocks. Our {{results are consistent with}} mutual fund herding speeding the price-adjustment process. DO INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS “F LOCK TOGETHER ” ~or “herd, ” as it is often called! when <b>they</b> <b>trade</b> securities?

5|$|At {{least as}} far back as the mid-1600s, the Sihanaka were {{established}} as a technologically sophisticated and prosperous people who provided slaves to slave traders supplying the plantations of the Mascarene Islands. To protect themselves and their wealth, Sihanaka villages were often fortified by earthen walls (tamboho) of the type also prevalent in the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina. Around 1700, the Sihanaka were a major trading partner of the Betsimisaraka, to whom <b>they</b> <b>traded</b> rice and zebu. The Betsimisaraka, desirous of greater access to Sihanaka wealth, successfully negotiated for French assistance to bring the Sihanaka under their control. French militiamen launched several attacks against Sihanaka communities. This incursion was foiled through a combination of firepower - the Sihanaka having obtained numerous firearms through trade with the Sakalava to the west - and the prevalence of malaria and other tropical diseases that decimated the French soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Casey Stengel, {{the manager}} of the New York Yankees, sought to acquire Turley.

To complete the trade, the Yankees sent Bill Miller, Kal Segrist, Don Leppert, and Ted Del Guercio to the Orioles, and the Orioles sent Mike Blyzka, Darrell Johnson, Jim Fridley and Dick Kryhoski to the Yankees.
