5|$|Careful {{measurement}} of {{the positions of the}} planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational perturbations, and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as celestial mechanics. More recently the tracking of near-Earth objects will allow for predictions of close encounters or potential collisions of <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>with</b> those objects.|$|E
5|$|Climate models use {{quantitative}} methods {{to simulate the}} interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface and ice. They are used {{for a variety of}} purposes; from the study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system, to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> <b>with</b> outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.|$|E

5|$|In {{models of}} the {{expanding}} universe, the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. This receding is not due to motion through space, but rather {{to the expansion of}} space itself. For example, galaxies far away from Earth appear to be moving away from <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>with</b> a speed proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called the Hubble sphere, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes greater than the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{atmosphere}} of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium by volume. The proportion of helium is significantly deficient {{compared to the}} abundance of this element in the Sun. The quantity of elements heavier than helium (metallicity) is not known precisely, but the proportions are assumed to match the primordial abundances from {{the formation of the}} Solar System. The total mass of these heavier elements is estimated to be 19–31 times the mass of <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> <b>with</b> a significant fraction located in Saturn's core region.|$|E
5|$|A termite nest can be {{considered}} as being composed of two parts, the inanimate and the animate. The animate is all of the termites living inside the colony, and the inanimate part is the structure itself, which is constructed by the termites. Nests can be broadly separated into three main categories: subterranean (completely below ground), epigeal (protruding above the soil surface), and arboreal (built above ground, but always connected to the ground via shelter tubes). Epigeal nests (mounds) protrude from <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> <b>with</b> ground contact and are made out of earth and mud. A nest has many functions such as providing a protected living space and providing shelter against predators. Most termites construct underground colonies rather than multifunctional nests and mounds. Primitive termites of today nest in wooden structures such as logs, stumps and the dead parts of trees, as did termites millions of years ago.|$|E

5|$|Batman & Robin is a 1997 American superhero film {{based on}} the DC Comics {{characters}} Batman and Robin. It is the fourth and final installment of Warner Bros.' initial Batman film series. The film was directed by Joel Schumacher and written by Akiva Goldsman. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Clooney, Chris O'Donnell, Alicia Silverstone, and Uma Thurman. Batman & Robin {{tells the story of}} Batman and Robin as they attempt to prevent Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy from freezing all mankind to death and repopulating <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> <b>with</b> mutant plants, {{while at the same time}} struggling to keep their partnership together.

5|$|Ideas {{from the}} Deep convened {{to come up}} with the design for the game, and Hall {{suggested}} a console-style platformer in the vein of Super Mario Bros., as they had the technology made for it; he further recommended a science fiction theme. John Carmack added the idea of a genius child protagonist saving the world, and Hall quickly created a short summary for the game: a dramatic introduction about eight-year-old genius Billy Blaze, defending <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>with</b> his spaceship. When he read out the summary in an over-dramatic voice to the group, they laughed and applauded, and the group agreed to begin work on Commander Keen in the Invasion of the Vorticons.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Walter Sydney Adams, using a 60-inch (1.5m) {{reflector}} at Mount Wilson Observatory, {{observed the}} spectrum of Sirius B and determined {{that it was a}} faint whitish star. This led astronomers to conclude that it was a white dwarf, the second to be discovered. The diameter of Sirius A was first measured by Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss in 1959 at Jodrell Bank using their stellar intensity interferometer. In 2005, using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers determined that Sirius B has nearly the diameter of <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> , <b>with</b> a mass 102% of the Sun's.|$|E

5|$|It {{was thought}} at the time that empty space was filled with a {{background}} medium called the luminiferous aether in which the electromagnetic field existed. Some physicists thought that this aether acted as a preferred frame of reference for the propagation of light and therefore {{it should be possible to}} measure the motion of <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>with</b> respect to this medium, by measuring the isotropy of the speed of light. Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is the experiment performed by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in 1887. The detected motion was always less than the observational error. Modern experiments indicate that the two-way speed of light is isotropic (the same in every direction) to within 6 nanometres per second.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-4b orbits {{its host}} star in 3.213 {{days at a}} {{distance}} of 0.046 AU. This places it almost 10 times closer to its star than Mercury is to the Sun. Consequently, Kepler-4b is thought to be extremely hot, with an equilibrium temperature greater than 1700 kelvins (2600°F). The planet is estimated to be 25 times more massive than <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>with</b> a radius that is 4 times greater than the Earth. This makes it similar to Neptune in terms of size and mass, but with a temperature that is not comparable to any planet in the Solar System (Venus, the hottest planet, is only 735 kelvins). Kepler-4b's eccentricity was assumed to be 0, however an independent reanalysis of the discovery data found a value of 0.25 ± 0.12, and a later reanalysis of the light curve discovered a secondary eclipse with depth 7.47 ± 1.82ppm at a phase of about 0.7.|$|E
5|$|Nu Phoenicis is a yellow-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type F9V and magnitude 4.96. Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun, {{and likely to}} be surrounded by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint to be seen with the naked eye. White dwarfs are extremely dense stars compacted into a volume the size of <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> <b>With</b> around 85% of the mass of the Sun, Gliese 915 has a surface gravity of 108.39 ± 0.01 (2.45 · 108) cm·s−2, or approximately 250,000 of Earth's.|$|E

5|$|Storm petrels {{normally}} nest in crevices between {{or under}} rocks, or burrow in the soil. When {{they make their}} own tunnels, they loosen <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> <b>with</b> their bills and kick out the debris with their feet. The birds less commonly nest in walls, under buildings or down rabbit burrows. Disused or occupied burrows of Atlantic puffins and Manx shearwaters are sometimes used, and the petrel pair may share a common entrance with those seabirds, rabbits or other pairs of its own species. Where other occupants are present, the petrels dig a side burrow or use an existing low-roofed tunnel which the larger birds or rabbits cannot easily enter. Even so, puffins and shearwaters will sometimes access and destroy nests, and adult petrels may be killed by their larger neighbours. Human-made plastic nesting tubes are readily used, and may provide protection against predators. Birds usually mate for life and use the same hole every year.|$|E
5|$|Timmy {{wakes up}} in what looks like his bedroom; in reality he is still inside The Darkness, {{and the world is}} merely an {{illusion}} to him. Timmy's fairy godparents and Jorgen come to rescue him, and they exit The Darkness successfully. Back on Earth, the Lead Eliminator uses Jorgen's wand to poof Timmy's friends and family away into The Darkness. Military Extraterrestrial Research Facility (M.E.R.F.) agents launch an array of military weapons at the Eliminator, but he absorbs the ordnance and turns into a more powerful version, the Destructinator.

5|$|Unlike Earth, Venus lacks a {{magnetic}} field. Its ionosphere separates the atmosphere {{from outer space}} and the solar wind. This ionised layer excludes the solar magnetic field, giving Venus a distinct magnetic environment. This is considered Venus's induced magnetosphere. Lighter gases, including water vapour, are continuously blown away by the solar wind through the induced magnetotail. It is speculated that the atmosphere of Venus up to around 4billion years ago was more like that of <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>with</b> liquid water on the surface. A runaway greenhouse effect may {{have been caused by}} the evaporation of the surface water and subsequent rise of the levels of other greenhouse gases.|$|E

5|$|After Ernest died in 1971, Ruth succeeded him {{as their}} group's leader and primary channeler. She {{subsequently}} began publishing accounts of her experiences and revelations. In early 1974, she predicted that a space fleet of benevolent extraterrestrials, the Space Brothers, would land on Earth later that year, which led the Unarius Academy {{to purchase a}} property {{to serve as the}} landing site. After the extraterrestrials failed to appear, Norman said that trauma she had suffered in a past life had caused her to make an inaccurate prediction. Undaunted, she rented a building for Unarius' meetings and sought publicity for the movement, claiming to have united <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>with</b> an interplanetary confederation. She revised the Space Brothers' expected landing date several times, before finally settling on 2001. Her health declined in the late 1980s, prompting her students to try to heal her with rituals of past-life regression. Despite predicting that she would live to see the extraterrestrials land, Norman died in 1993. Unarius has continued to operate after her death, and formed a board of directors. Since the 2000s, leaders have concentrated on individual transformation leading to spiritual change in humankind.|$|E
5|$|From the {{earliest}} times, the Chinese {{were concerned with}} the destructive force of earthquakes. It was recorded in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian of 91BC that in 780BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers. It was not known {{at the time that}} earthquakes were caused by the shifting of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou Dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic yin and yang, along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty. These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the Yijing (Book of Changes), in its fifty-first hexagram. There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the ancient Greeks. Anaxagoras (c.500–428BC) believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface crust of the earth bursting into the Earth's hollows; Democritus (c. 460–370BC) believed that the saturation of <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>with</b> water caused them; Anaximenes (c.585–c.525BC) believed they were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying; and Aristotle (384–322BC) believed they were caused by instability of vapor (pneuma) caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} theories for forces {{developed from}} the unification of disparate ideas. For example, Isaac Newton unified, with his universal theory of gravitation, the force responsible for objects falling near the surface of <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>with</b> the force responsible for the falling of celestial bodies about the Earth (the Moon) and the Sun (the planets). Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through a theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons. This standard model of particle physics assumes a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory, which was subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations suggest that the standard model is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory that allows for {{the combination of the}} electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything. Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory.|$|E
