40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the paper}} is to derive the exact {{analytical}} expressions for torsion and bending creep of rods that obey the Norton–Bailey, Prandtl–Garofalo and Naumenko–Altenbach–Gorash constitutive models. The common secondary creep constitutive model is the Norton–Bailey law which gives a power law relationship between creep rate and stress. The closed form solutions for fractional Norton–Bailey creep law are derived. The analytical formulas express the torque and bending moment as functions of {{the time for the}} period of relaxation. Other formulas express the twist rate and curvature as functions of the time for the duration of engineering creep experiment. The derived formulas are suitable for the practically important problems of machinery. Namely, the formulas are relevant for calculation of hereditary effects for helical, leaf and disk springs and <b>twisted</b> <b>shafts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Bobosaurus forojuliensis, gen. et sp. nov., {{is a large}} sauropterygian {{from the}} Alpine Late Triassic (Early Carnian, northeastern Italy). The holotype is a {{moderately}} disarticulated skeleton consisting of {{the tip of the}} rostrum, part of the neck (including the atlas-axis complex), the trunk, most of the tail, parts of the limbs, and the pelvic girdle. The new taxon is characterized by a mosaic of "nothosaurian" and "plesiosaurian" features. It exhibits characters that were previously considered autapomorphies of different sauropterygian taxa. Dorsal neural spines are very high as in Nothosaurus mirabilis, and each dorsal rib has a distinct uncinate process, a diagnostic feature of the placodont Paraplacodus. The atlas-axis complex has the plesiosaurian pattern but is peculiar in several details. The neural spines of the anterior cervicals have an arched anterior margin. The spade-shaped pubis lacks an obturator foramen and an articulation with the ilium, and is associated with a stout, "hourglass-shaped" ilium that has a <b>twisted</b> <b>shaft.</b> Apomorphic characters include: cervical centra higher than wide and "pear-shaped" in anteroposterior view, a peculiar zygapophyseal articulation of pectoral to "caudal" vertebrae like that found in the dorsal vertebrae of Simosaurus, but with a reversed anteroposterior polarity, high neural spines on all vertebrae, neural spine of "sacral" to mid-caudal vertebrae with a bottle-shaped profile in lateral view, peculiar mid-posterior cervical ribs, lightened skeleton, and a comparatively large humerus. The new taxon was a specialized surface swimmer with a stiffened trunk and large forelimbs. It represents one of very few Late Triassic eusauropterygian taxa.

In its interior are five skulls and bones, as well as coffin boards and pieces of badana of the linings that covered them. It has been assumed that Queen Eleanor was buried in the tombstone of María of Almenara, whose mortal remains could be transferred to another tomb placed in the same nave, and inside which a female mummy, corpulent and of mature age.

Next to him, where also depositred the remains of a young man, identified as the Infante Ferdinand, son of Alfonso IV, and those of an adult woman, who were identified as those of Queen Eleanor de Castile, second wife of Alfonso IV. The remains of Alfonso IV, who had been transferred to the Old Cathedral of Lleida in 1781, remained in the crypt until 1986, when they were placed in a stone tomb, located next to the door of San Berenguer of the cathedral.In the Church of Nuestra Señora del Manzano of Castrojeriz a tomb is conserved, attributed to the Queen Eleanor de Castile, that is located at the feet of the church, near the baptistery, and was discovered in June 1970, hidden behind a wall of adobe, by the Rescue Mission Group Marqués de Camarasa School Group. From the moment of his discovery, the grave was attributed by the experts to the Queen Eleanor de Castile, daughter of Ferdinand IV, because the fashion of the sepulcher corresponds with other tombs realized in the middle of the 14th century, as well as by the fact that on its cap appears the sculpted figure of a woman. The assumption that Queen Eleanor was buried in this tomb is supported by the fact that certain documents found mention that Queen Leonor was buried in that church.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Torque measurement of a rotating shaft is a method of monitoring machine performance. Steady transmission of mechanical power from the prime mover to the load is vital to avoid gear and bearing wear, shaft fatigue failure, bearing and coupling failure and noise. Mean and fluctuating torque are fundamental quantities of interest. The laser torquemeter is capable of providing a non-contact measurement of time-resolved torque through a driven system. The laser torquemeter depends upon laser speckle produced from coherent light illuminating a diffuse object and the speckle pattern {{may be used in}} determining the angular position of a rotating object. When the object rotates the backscattered speckle pattern, which changes continuously but repeats exactly with every revolution, is sampled by a suitably positioned photo detector. The photo detector output signal is periodic and one period is recorded in memory as a reference and the angular position of a shaft can then be determined by a comparison of this recorded reference signal with the current photo detector output signal. The speckle pattern from two axially separated points on the shaft are monitored and under low or, ideally, zero torque the photo detector outputs are recorded into the laser torquemeter electronics. The laser torquemeter then tracks the live photo detector output and determines the angle at the two points on the shaft. Relative angular displacement in the two angle outputs appears when torque is applied and the <b>shaft</b> <b>twists.</b> When the <b>shaft</b> is displaced, for example by vibration, the backscattered speckle pattern changes on the photo detector and the similarity between the recorded, reference signal and the live, current signal is reduced. In this thesis, the cross-correlation of the real-time photodetector output signal and the recorded reference signal as a function of shaft position is examined. The effects of various shaft motions - rotation, axial translation, pitch and yaw, and radial translation are theoretically and experimentally examined and the results can then be used in the design of an optical head for the laser torquemeter. A review of the current torquemeter technology allows for discussion of the broad spectrum of typical torquemeter operating conditions. The optical head of the laser torquemeter may vary significantly for various torque measurement scenarios. A design procedure for the optical head of the laser torquemeter is summarised. The holy grail of torquemeter manufacturers is to produce a cheap, easy to use, robust, accurate, reliable and non-contacting torquemeter. The laser torque meter has great potential to meet these requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{fracture}} of a turbine shaft {{in the case}} of overloading can exhibit brittle or plastic failure, depending on the material properties, the turbine-shaft geometry and the form of loading. Usually, when the toughness increases, the stiffness of the shaft material is reduced, which can lead to the plastic <b>twist</b> of the <b>shaft.</b> If the fatigue crack appears in the critical region of the shaft then the low impact-toughness value may induce a brittle fracture. During the retrofit of a hydro-power plant a new turbine shaft was produced by quenching-and-tempering technology. Charpy impact-toughness tests showed lower values for the shaft material than those prescribed by the project documentation. Since the turbine shaft for a hydro-power plant is a massive and expensive component, it is necessary to determine a sufficient impact toughness for the material in terms of the geometry and the manner of loading for the turbine shaft. Since only the yield strength and the impact toughness of the material were prescribed, the level 0 of the SINTAP should be applied. The minimum impact toughness values that ensure the ductile {{fracture of}} the shaft, cracked circumferentially was also estimated.

40|$|An optical {{diagnostic}} system capable of measuring angular displacements in a torsionally loaded shaft through noncontact means has been developed. Conven-tional torsion diagnostic mechanisms must {{come in contact}} with the shaft to be analyzed. The signal-to-noise ratio response of conventional systems is compro-mised by dirt and wear. Another consequence of these devices is that the shaft being diagnosed must be cut in half to implement the mechanism. In this work, the <b>shaft</b> angle of <b>twist</b> (4) is measured utilizing precision optics and HeNe laser light. Accuracy in the placement and orientation of mirrors on the shaft surface is shown to be crucial, since precise bending of the laser light is required to effectively measure twisting distortions. A CdS photoresistor was augmented with a high gain operational amplifier for light sensing. This system was then implemented as the receiving source of optically measured torsional displacements. Experimental results confirm that the voltage response of the amplifier varies linearly with 4. It is shown that the amplifier output voltage varies {{as a function of the}} amount of optical energy received from the shaft reflected laser light.
