5|$|Poison {{was given}} a {{secondary}} outfit for Capcom Fighting All-Stars alongside her primary classic attire. Made of shiny, silvery material it consisted of boots that extended halfway up her <b>thighs</b> <b>and</b> a combined sleeveless shirt/short skirt with a plunging neckline. Gloves and a small hairband were also added, {{as well as a}} belt, with the handcuffs hanging off of it. Her arm straps were removed, though the strap around her neck remained.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{concerns}} are hypothyroidism, allergies, epilepsy, diabeties and glandular disorders which may cause baldness. The hair loss occurs at around {{six months of}} age, affecting the neck, <b>thighs</b> <b>and</b> tail; however the frequency has been reduced through work conducted by the breed clubs. Hip dysplasia is seen in around 8.3% of the breed, according to surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals over a twenty five-year period between 1974 and 1999. This {{was one of the}} lower results of the sporting breeds, with Greyhounds coming lowest with 3.4%, and the related Boykin Spaniel coming in second highest at 47%. There was no evidence of elbow dysplasia found. The breed has an average life span of 1013 years.|$|E
5|$|Herrerasaurus {{was fully}} bipedal. It had strong hind limbs with short <b>thighs</b> <b>and</b> rather long feet, {{indicating}} {{that it was}} likely a swift runner. The foot had five toes, but only the middle three (digits II, III, and IV) bore weight. The outer toes (I and V) were small; the first toe had a small claw. The tail, partially stiffened by overlapping vertebral projections, balanced the body and was also an adaptation for speed. The forelimbs of Herrerasaurus were {{less than half the}} length of its hind limbs. The upper arm and forearm were rather short, while the manus (hand) was elongated. The first two fingers and the thumb ended in curved, sharp claws for grasping prey. The fourth and fifth digits were small stubs without claws.|$|E

[...] When standing free, obtuse angles are formed between the dog's upper <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> the hip bone, the upper <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> the lower <b>thigh,</b> <b>and</b> the lower <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> metatarsal. The upper thigh is moderately long, broad and strongly muscled. The lower thigh is long, strongly and broadly muscled, sinewy. The hocks are sturdy, well angulated, not steep. The hind feet are slightly longer than the front feet. [...] Toes are strong, arched, as tight as the front feet.|$|R
5|$|On 13 March 1995, {{a pair of}} legs, severed at the knees, {{was found}} in a plastic bag {{floating}} off Clifford Pier. Three days later, a pair of <b>thighs</b> <b>and</b> a torso were found in the same area, also in a plastic bag. Initially, Singapore police could only determine that the body parts belonged to a Caucasian, and they had a possible name after receiving a missing person report for Lowe from the South African High Commission. Vanessa Lowe filed the report because she was distressed that her husband, who used to make daily contact with his family when overseas, had not called home or returned to South Africa by 12 March. Lowe's colleagues at work also tried to determine his whereabouts through personal contacts in Singapore. On 1 April, she confirmed that the body parts were her husband's through visual identification. However, his arms and head were never found.|$|E

25|$|As {{subcutaneous}} fat accumulates, dimpling, or cellulite, becomes more apparent on the <b>thighs</b> <b>and</b> buttocks. Stretch marks (striae distensae) may {{appear on the}} skin in these areas. Susceptibility to sunburn increases, possibly because the skin is thinner and less pigmented.|$|E
25|$|Men {{are more}} likely to have fat stored in the abdomen due to sex hormone differences. Female sex hormone causes fat to be stored in the buttocks, <b>thighs,</b> <b>and</b> hips in women. When women reach {{menopause}} and the estrogen produced by the ovaries declines, fat migrates from the buttocks, hips and thighs to the waist; later fat is stored in the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|The figurine {{is roughly}} biconical. Typical of other venus figures, the {{feminine}} features are overemphasized: the <b>thighs</b> <b>and</b> hips are large while the belly, breasts and buttocks are protruding. The head is a cone, the arms are barely sketched, {{and there are}} no hands, feet, or shoulders at all. The back is concave. In some points a few traces of red ochre paint are still visible.|$|E

25|$|It is {{advised to}} {{maintain}} a degree of muscle tension in this asana. Moderate tension in the <b>thighs</b> <b>and</b> hips can help develop positive habits and can increase the musculature in those areas which can help prevent injury. Additionally maintaining a degree of tension requires awareness, which can help prevent injury itself. Though in this asana {{it is unlikely to}} injure one's self, this habit can be beneficial throughout yoga practice.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of adipose (fat) tissue changes slowly over months and years. HRT causes {{the body to}} accumulate new fat in a typically feminine pattern, including in the hips, thighs, buttocks, pubis, upper arms, and breasts. (Fat on the hips, <b>thighs,</b> <b>and</b> buttocks has a higher concentration of omega-3 fatty acids and {{is meant to be}} used for lactation.) The body begins to burn old adipose tissue in the waist, shoulders, and back, making those areas smaller.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{remaining}} nonvisceral fat is found just below the skin in a region called the hypodermis. This subcutaneous fat {{is not related to}} many of the classic obesity-related pathologies, such as heart disease, cancer, and stroke, and some evidence even suggests it might be protective. The typically female (or gynecoid) pattern of body fat distribution around the hips, <b>thighs,</b> <b>and</b> buttocks is subcutaneous fat, and therefore poses less of a health risk compared to visceral fat.|$|E

25|$|She was {{comatose}} for 12 days. She suffered severe hypothermia, severe brain damage, Class 4 (the most severe) hemorrhagic shock, {{and loss}} of 75–80 percent of her blood from five deep stab wounds and a gash {{on one of her}} <b>thighs,</b> <b>and</b> internal bleeding. Her skull had been fractured so badly that her left eye was dislodged from its socket, which in turn was fractured in 21 places, and she suffered as well from facial fractures.|$|E
25|$|When {{dining in}} a {{traditional}} tatami room, sitting upright on the floor is common. In a casual setting, men usually sit with their feet crossed and women sit with both legs to one side. Only men are supposed to sit cross-legged. The formal way of sitting for both sexes is a kneeling style known as seiza. To sit in a seiza position, one kneels {{on the floor with}} legs folded under the <b>thighs</b> <b>and</b> the buttocks resting on the heels.|$|E
25|$|In males, {{the first}} pubic hair {{appears as a}} few sparse hairs that are usually thin on the scrotum or at the upper base of the penis (stage 2). Within a year, hairs {{around the base of}} the penis are {{abundant}} (stage 3). Within 3 to 4 years, hair fills the pubic area (stage 4) and becomes much thicker and darker, and by 5 years extends to the near <b>thighs</b> <b>and</b> upwards on the abdomen toward the umbilicus (stage 5).|$|E

25|$|At {{low ambient}} {{temperatures}} the common ostrich utilizes feather flattening, which conserves body heat through insulation. The low conductance coefficient of air allows less heat {{to be lost}} to the environment. This flattening behavior compensate for common ostrich's rather poor cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL). These feather heavy {{areas such as the}} body, <b>thighs</b> <b>and</b> wings do not usually vary much from ambient temperatures due to this behavioural controls. This ostrich will also cover its legs to reduce heat loss to the environment, along with undergoing piloerection and shivering when faced with low ambient temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Midler {{made her}} first motion picture in 1979, {{starring}} in the 1960s-era rock and roll tragedy The Rose, as a drug-addicted rock star modeled after Janis Joplin. That year, she also released her fifth studio album, <b>Thighs</b> <b>and</b> Whispers. Midler's first foray into disco was a commercial and critical failure {{and went on to}} be her all-time lowest charting album, peaking at No. 65 on the Billboard album chart. Soon afterward, she began a world concert tour, with one of her shows in Pasadena being filmed and released as the concert film Divine Madness (1980).|$|E
