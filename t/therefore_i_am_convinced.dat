60|$|The rush of an enraged Animal is {{far more}} easily avoided than is usually supposed. The way the Spanish bull-fighters play with the bull, is well known: any man can avoid a mere headlong charge. Even {{the speed of a}} racer, which is undeniably far greater than any wild quadruped, does not exceed 30 miles an hour or four times the speed of a man. The speed of an {{ordinary}} horse is not more than 24 miles an hour: now even the fastest wild beast is unable to catch an ordinary horse, except by crawling unobserved close to his side, and springing upon him; <b>therefore</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> that the rush of no wild animal exceeds 24 miles an hour, or three times the speed of a man. (See Measurements of the rate of an animal's gallop, p. 37.) It is perfectly easy for a person who is cool, to avoid an animal, by dodging to one side or other of a bush. Few animals turn, if the rush be unsuccessful. The buffalo is an exception; he regularly hunts a man, and is therefore peculiarly dangerous. Unthinking persons talk of the fearful rapidity of a lion or tiger's spring. It is not rapid at all: it is a slow movement, as must be evident from The following consideration. No wild animal can leap ten yards, and they all make a high trajectory in their leaps. Now, think of the speed of a ball thrown, or rather pitched, with just sufficient force to be caught by a person ten yards off: it is a mere nothing. The catcher can play with it as he likes; he has even time to turn after it, if thrown wide. But the speed of a springing animal is undeniably {{the same as that of}} a ball, thrown so as to make a flight of equal length and height in the air. The corollary to all this is, that, if charged, you must keep cool and watchful, and your chance of escape is far greater than non-sportsmen would imagine. The blow of the free paw is far swifter than the bound.|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies of}} {{bereavement}} {{deal with the}} mourning process. Through this process, the relationship is built between the bereaved and the dead. This paper focuses on what the relationship is. How can we be with the dead when we are left alive and alone? I researched what {{a relationship with a}} dead father or mother is by the "Nine-In-One Drawing Method" and interviews with two subjects as cooperators. In these interviews, I asked about their mourning processes and found them to be very individual. I asked them to draw about their dead father or mother. While they were drawing, their relationship with the deceased parent appeared. They could feel warmth, and they felt cared for in the relationship. I believe that such experiences play important roles in the mourning process, enabling them to have an individual relationship with the dead. The relationship was not realistic. But it was true in the intermediate area. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> that a relationship with the dead can take form in the intermediate area, and it should be grasped and understood in relation to the mourning process...|$|E
40|$|The {{database}} collected {{using the}} Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) operated by SAHFOS covers {{a long time}} span (surveys are on-going since 1946) and the whole North Atlantic, including the North Sea. It is therefore a unique tool to investigate changes in the planktonic community composition. Key publications have documented, for example, changes in zooplankton and chlorophyll abundance over the past decades. However, the data on calcareous plankton archived in the CPR database {{have not yet been}} exploited. The publication of the "Atlas of Calcifying Plankton" by SAHFOS and EPOCA begins to fill this gap and <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> most timely. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> that the scientific community will use this short preliminary description of the data available to investigate the drivers of the changes (or lack of thereof) reported in the Atlas...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty years there has been a {{remarkable}} theoretical flourishing in the field of environmental philosophy, with the development of biocentric ethics, animal rights theories, deep ecology, ecofeminism, modified utilitarianism, moral pluralism and theories drawing on numerous religious and cultural traditions. These theories explore the intellectual and moral causes for the environmentally destructive practices of the dominant western industrial and economic culture, and propose alternatives that might avoid these consequences. This symposium raises a worthy question: to what extent have these theories had practical impact on environmental law and policy. I come to this question as a lawyer and not a philosopher. My interest in environmental philosophy has grown out of the belief that environmental law cannot and will not succeed unless there is strong public commitment to conserving nonhuman nature. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> that environmental law will not endure or have lasting effect unless environmental philosophy does indeed come down to earth successfully to affect how people view the world. Several of the participants in this symposium have contributed over the years to the important work of trying to ensure that this happens. I will argue that this work is vitally important for the future of environmental law {{as well as for the}} success of environmental philosophy itself...|$|E
40|$|Readers {{are invited}} to reflect upon their own {{research}} with reference to conversation analysis, discourse segment analysis, centering theory, corpus analysis, and computer-mediated communication. As regards the overall structure and {{the contents of the}} volume, some readers might feel that the amount of information and theoretical density is sometimes overwhelming, including the profuse bibliographical references to justify the author’s assertions. Readers may also wonder why some topics appear in more than one chapter. My impression in both cases is that each chapter is conceived as autonomous, with the potential to be used independ-ently, so that some repetition is necessary to provide complete description without reference to other chapters. In sum, one of the outstanding merits of this book is that the author presents the discipline not only as an academic exercise, undoubtedly interesting for applied linguists, but also {{as a response to the}} social quandaries of everyday interaction, and it will thus appeal to researchers in disciplines such as social psychology, media studies or language acquisition. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> that Kecskes ’ volume is likely to become a classic in pragmatics, due to both its respectful debate with traditional theories, and also its exploration of innovative niches of research in language, culture, and society.
