5|$|Evans and {{his agents}} set about aggressively {{collecting}} royalties from those using his designs. Furthermore, Evans significantly raised the license fees for {{his use of}} his patented technology, raising claims of extortion from those being asked to pay, and a great many cases ended up in court. The 1808 act had indemnified those who had adopted Evans's technologies from 1805 to 1808, but did not specify whether this indemnity was perpetual (as defendants argued) {{or whether it was}} only for the three years in question (as Evans argued). Evans by this stage of his life had also established a poor reputation for himself amongst <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> community, and his abrasive and often petty pursuit of patent rights stiffened resistance. Several major legal cases questioned whether laws to extend private patents in this manner were even constitutional, but Evans ultimately prevailed in each case.|$|E
5|$|Uranium ore is mined {{in several}} ways: by open pit, underground, in-situ leaching, and {{borehole}} mining (see uranium mining). Low-grade uranium ore mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25% uranium oxides. Extensive measures must {{be employed to}} extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, Canada can contain up to 23% uranium oxides on average. Uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali. The leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange. The resulting mixture, called yellowcake, contains at least 75% uranium oxides U3O8. Yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> process before refining and conversion.|$|E
5|$|The most bitter {{legal battle}} began in 1809. Evans sued Samuel Robinson—a miller near Baltimore who was using Evans's {{improvements}} {{without a license}} to produce a very modest amount of flour—for damages of $2,500. That sum was deemed unjustifiably high and harsh by many, and Evans's actions rallied the Baltimore community against him, and when the case was finally heard in 1812 many appeared {{in support of the}} defendant. Evans's detractors presented evidence and witnesses at the trial to press the argument that Evans did not truly invent much of what his patents protected. Although the hopper-boy was undoubtedly original, the use of bucket chains and Archimedean screws had been used since ancient times and Evans had only modified some of their features and adapted them for use in a milling context. A now retired Thomas Jefferson weighed into the debate in letters to both Evans and his detractors, questioning the philosophy of patent law and what truly defined 'invention' and 'machine' (and to some extent the validity of his claims) but ultimately defended the purpose of patent law, which was to incentivize innovation by rewarding inventors for their development and sharing of new technology. And Jefferson noted that though Evans's designs consisted of devices that had long existed beforehand, everyone had access to these and yet only Evans had thought to modify and use them in conjunction to build an automatic mill. Ultimately the jury found in favor of Evans, but it was a pyrrhic victory as Evans had put most of <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> community offside in the process, and ultimately reduced his claim against Robinson to $1,000. In response, prominent Evans critic Isaac McPherson, made submission to Congress {{in the wake of the}} trial entitled Memorial to the Congress of Sundry Citizens of the United States, Praying Relief from the Oppressive Operations of Oliver Evans' Patent, seeking to limit the compensation Evans could seek for his patent's use or for Congress to void it altogether. Although the Senate drafted a bill that would roll-back some of Evans's patent rights, it did not pass, and he continued to vigorously pursue his patent fees. It would not be until the Patent Act of 1836 that many of these issues, including what constituted originality in the context of a patent, would be addressed.|$|E

Although the gains were small, it proved those who thought <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> would quickly fold to be wrong. A small-scale strike hampered <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> in 1890. In 1891 and 1892, <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> reported losses. However, in 1893 <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> recovered and in 1894, <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> took in substantial gains. 1895 appeared to be another solid year, when suddenly, <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> was sold and moved.

25|$|There are 20 rice {{mills in}} Santa María that {{accommodate}} <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> and storage {{needs of the}} farmers for their palay harvest. The rice brunts (darak production) of these mills complement the feed requirements of the livestock raisers.|$|E
25|$|The first {{recorded}} attempt to extract useful work from a Manitoba river was in 1829 at a flour mill (known as Grant's Mill) located on Sturgeon Creek {{in what is}} now Winnipeg. This was not successful and <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> equipment was later operated by a windmill.|$|E
25|$|An unusual {{feature of}} Kilmaurs Mill was a carved stone showing a {{millstone}} drive spider or rind (often used on Miller's tombstones {{as a symbol}} of <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> trade) on which the upper grindstone rested, a ring of rope, a bill for dressing millstones, and a grain shovel.|$|E
50|$|In 1902, <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> {{was sold}} to Jan Rietema of Leens. A Deutz petrol engine was {{installed}} in that year as auxiliary power.
