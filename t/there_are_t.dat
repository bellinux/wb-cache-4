5000|$|Many Taiwanese {{immigrants}} have recently settled in Vancouver, B.C., forming a growing and stable Taiwanese Canadian community; however, {{it is often}} overlooked due {{to the presence of}} a larger Hong Kong Chinese immigrant base. Many of these immigrants from Taiwan, especially those without family or relatives in United States, find it easier to immigrate to Canada. These Taiwanese immigrants are also relatively wealthy and like many of the Hong Kong Chinese can afford Vancouver's high cost of living. The Greater Vancouver metropolitan area offers comfortable living and the conveniences of modern Chinese shopping centers with a vast array of restaurants, eateries, and grocery stores that provide the foods and entertainment that reflect the modern trends that the Hong Kong Chinese and Taiwanese were accustomed to prior to arriving in Canada. Because Vancouver has more Hong Kong Chinese than Taiwanese, the fashions and products available largely reflect the modern trends of Hong Kong more so than Taiwan. This is in contrast to the Santa Clara Valley/Silicon Valley and San Gabriel Valley in California where there are concentrated communities with larger proportions of people of Taiwanese heritage and where many [...] "Chinese" [...] shopping centers, restaurants, supermarkets, and other retail businesses tend to reflect more of the modern Taiwanese trends. (Note: Both Taiwan and Hong Kong have long held powerful influences on the Chinese-speaking communities around the world regarding trends in food, popular culture, and fashions). <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>T</b> & T Supermarkets in Canada as opposed to 99 Ranch Markets in the United States.|$|E
