25|$|This {{was always}} my life, {{but now it}} takes up {{so much of my}} life that it's very difficult. In fact {{survival}} is very, very hard. My flat's nothing special – two rooms – and I live as frugally as I possibly can to make sure I can campaign. I'm not trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> out to be a martyr because this is my choice.|$|E
25|$|If {{somebody}} kept a {{very accurate}} {{record of a}} human being, going through the era from the Gay 90s, from {{a very different kind}} of world through the turn of the century—as far into the twentieth century as you might live. I decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> a good case history of such a human being and it meant that I could not be judge of what was valid to put in or not. I must put everything in, so I started a very rigorous record.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} in the German daily Die Welt on April 24, 2015, concerning the Fourteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Burke renewed his criticism on German Cardinal Walter Kasper, whose “merciful” solution for remarried divorcees who wish to receive communion was discussed at the 2014 Extraordinary Synod. “We are bound by the Magisterium. But some Synod Fathers, above all Cardinal Kasper, want to change it. So I had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> very clear. Clashes at Synods, incidentally, are nothing unusual. Think of the early Councils, the Arian heresy, for instance, when Athanasius even became physically aggressive”, Burke recalled. He also recalled that Pope John Paul II had ruled out women’s ordination “once and for all”.|$|E

Maybe if I put answers <b>to</b> really <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> look risky then I might qualify for some.’ [...]...|$|R

I am bound to Aoste, and should be happy to do your bidding with the worthy Giacomo.

500|$|In one of {{his first}} interviews, Cobain told Sounds {{journalist}} John Robb, [...] "When I write a song the lyrics are the least important thing. I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all. Sometimes I try to make things harder for myself, just to try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> a bit more angry. I try out a few subconscious things I suppose, like conflicts with other people. Most of the lyrics on the Bleach album are about my life in Aberdeen." ...|$|E
500|$|DeJoseph left, {{leaving the}} band without a drummer. Mark O'Connell, {{a friend of}} Reyes, heard about the vacancy and joined the group. After {{recording}} Taking Back Sunday's self-titled EP, Longo left the band and eventually played with Guilt Like Gravity and the Mirror. In December 2000, Lazzara switched from bass to lead vocals. He never thought he would become the group's singer: [...] "I remember getting into [...] Windstar with that [...] and just driving around singing those songs, just <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> actually do it." [...] O'Connell suggested that the group needed a bassist, and brought in Shaun Cooper of Breaking Pangaea. In February 2001, Taking Back Sunday released a five-track demo before touring for a year.|$|E
500|$|... "It Girl" [...] {{was written}} by Jason Derulo, E. Kidd Bogart, Lindy Robbins and Emanuel [...] "Eman" [...] Kiriakou, who also {{produced}} the track. The engineering process was handled by Jens Koerkmeier. It was mixed by Serban Ghenea at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The song's keyboards, whistle, guitars, bass, percussion and drum programming were provided by Eman, with additional keyboards and drum programming by Koerkmeier and Andrew Goldstein. On July 29, 2011, the audio of [...] "It Girl" [...] was uploaded to Derulo's official YouTube account. When speaking of the song, Derulo told The Daily Telegraph, [...] "I wanted to put myself in a position as if I'd found my It Girl, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> feel like if I found that one true love. I've basically described {{what it would be}} like if I found her." [...] Derulo further elaborated about the concept of the song in another interview with Matt Elias of MTV News: ...|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from the}} romantic theme in her storyline Ruby {{has been shown}} as an {{aspiring}} singer. Breeds is classically trained in real life and said she doesn't mind singing on camera. Discussing this she stated: [...] "When you're playing a character you can hide behind them. I know it's still my voice, [...] I was more confident singing from Ruby's point of view. Even {{though there was a}} storyline where she was terrified about singing in a school play, I wasn't nervous at all. I had to try really hard <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> feel nervous." [...] She revealed she had to play down her voice and make it [...] "a bit cleaner" [...] and a [...] "bit more inexperienced". This was due to the fact {{it was meant to be}} that she had never sung before – [...] "I have to pull her back a bit." [...] She added the storyline was realistic because there are no set guidelines for discovering vocal talent.|$|E
500|$|Williams {{declared}} {{his intention to}} stand for election on 15 May 1860, one day after Müller. In his written submission to Convocation, he emphasised his suitability for appointment {{in the light of}} Boden's missionary wishes. After giving details of his life and career, particularly his experience in Sanskrit obtained at Haileybury, he stated that for the past 14 years [...] "the one idea of my life has been <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> thoroughly conversant with Sanskrit, and by every means in my power to facilitate the study of its literature." [...] He assured voters that, if elected, [...] "my utmost energies shall be devoted to the one object which its Founder had in view;—namely The promotion of a more general and critical knowledge of the Sanskrit language, as a means of enabling Englishmen to proceed in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion. Unlike Müller, he regarded the study of Sanskrit [...] "as chiefly a means to the missionary conversion of the Hindus rather than as an end in itself", as Dowling puts it. In this way, Dowling says, he could attempt to deflect attention from his [...] "modest abilities in classical Sanskrit" [...] when compared to Müller's [...] "internationally acknowledged achievements". Moreover, the appeal to Boden's original intentions came during a period when Convocation tended to pay little attention to the expressed wishes of benefactors.|$|E
2500|$|Ah, by Bacchus, {{with this}} aria / I'll have {{universal}} applause. / They'll say to me, [...] "Bravo, Maestro! / I, with a sufficiently modest air, / Will go around {{with my head}} bent... / [...] I’ll have eulogies in the newspaper / I know how <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> immortal.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor to disgrace me; nor <b>to</b> <b>make</b> me feel <b>myself</b> disgraced {{in my own}} judgment?" [...] Then {{there was}} a pause for some moments as though he had left her without another word to say. [...] "Shall I go now?" [...] he asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} think me ungrateful or churlish, Mr. Fentolin," [...] he begged. [...] "I have {{a habit of}} keeping {{promises}} which I <b>make</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> and to-night I have made myself a promise that I will {{be back at the}} Tower by ten o'clock." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{retired as}} a school teacher in 2006. I plan to use my {{experience}} and talent <b>to</b> <b>make</b> music for <b>myself</b> and other folks as a producer. Instead of me being the center of attention, I would like to help other folks get {{a bit of the}} spotlight." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although multi-faceted and complex, Casanova's personality, as he {{described}} it, was dominated by his sensual urges: [...] "Cultivating whatever gave pleasure to my senses was always the chief business of my life; I never found any occupation more important. Feeling that I was born for the sex opposite of mine, I have always loved it and done all that I could <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> loved by it." [...] He noted that he sometimes used [...] "assurance caps" [...] to prevent impregnating his mistresses.|$|E
2500|$|None of {{the five}} Blackwell sisters ever married. Elizabeth thought {{courtship}} games were foolish early in her life, and prized her independence. When commenting on the young men trying to court her during her time in Kentucky, she said: [...] "...do not imagine I am going <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> a whole just at present; the fact is I cannot find my other half here, but only about a sixth, which would not do." [...] Even during her time at Geneva Medical College, she rejected advances from a few suitors.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the long}} {{production}} of Ashes of Time, Wong faced a two-month break {{as he waited}} for equipment to re-record sound for some scenes. He was in a negative state, feeling heavy pressure from his backers and worrying about another failure, and so decided to start a new project: [...] "I thought I should do something <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> feel comfortable about making films again. So I made Chungking Express, which I made like a student film." [...] Conceived and completed within only six weeks, the new project ended up being released two months before Ashes of Time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said her}} cousin, [...] "so do I {{remember}} him. He has crossed my path many times since, Virginia. And mark what I say--it was he whom {{you had in}} mind on that birthday when you implored me <b>to</b> <b>make</b> something of <b>myself,</b> It was Stephen Brice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then it shall, Miss St. Just. Then it shall, {{once and}} for all: {{formally}} and deliberately, it shall end now. Suppose,--I only say suppose,--that I could, without failing in my own honour, my duty <b>to</b> my calling, <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> such a name among good men that, poor parson though I be, your family need be ashamed of nothing about me, save my poverty? Tell me, now and for ever, could it be possible--" ...|$|R
60|$|Now I {{had made}} up my mind to gainsay Sihamba, not that I could find any fault with her plan, but because if such {{arrangements}} are to be made, I like <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them <b>myself,</b> as is the business of the head of the house. I think Sihamba guessed this; at any rate she answered me before I spoke, and that in an odd way, namely, by looking first at the swallow's nest, then at the blooming bough of the peach tree, and lastly into the far distances of air.|$|R
2500|$|Vandenbroucke said in 2004: [...] "I've {{never done}} {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> popular. In fact, the opposite. Sometimes I think it's all a dream. I've thrown up a marriage, I've been on bad terms with my parents for a long time, all of which has troubled and exhausted me." [...] He said he had disappointed sponsors, managers and directeurs sportifs, even though they continued to show confidence in him. [...] "I had become schizophrenic," [...] he said. Without psychiatric help, he would [...] "have followed the same path as Pantani", the Italian rider found dead on a hotel floor. After 450,000 French francs a month at Cofidis, he earned 220,000 at Lampre in 2001 and then half that at Fasso Bortolo.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the artistic}} depth of Earle's backgrounds, it was decided for the {{characters}} to be stylized so they could appropriately match the backgrounds. While the layout artists and animators were impressed with Earles's paintings, they eventually grew depressed at working with a style {{that many of them}} regarded as too cold, too flat, and too modernist for a fairy tale. Nevertheless, Walt insisted on the visual design claiming that the inspirational art he commissioned in the past had homogenized the animators. Frank Thomas would complain to Ken Peterson, head of the animation department, of Earles's [...] "very rigid design" [...] because of the inhibiting effect on the animators that was less problematic than working with Mary Blair's designs, in which Peterson would respond that the design style was Walt's decision, and that, like it or not, they had to use it. Because of this, Thomas developed a red blotch on his face and had to visit the doctor each week to have it attended to. Production designer Ken Anderson also complained: [...] "I had to fight myself <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> draw that way." [...] Another character animator on Aurora claimed their unit was so cautious about the drawings that the clean-up animators produced one drawing a day, which translated into one second of screen time per month.|$|E
2500|$|Riegel found {{humor in}} the {{situation}} and said, [...] "Unfortunately, we only got the script like three days ahead of time! But hey! We're old pros." [...] When asked if they were intimidated by {{the challenge of the}} reveal scenes, Riegel asserted that she [...] "wasn't scared at all," [...] and clarified that it [...] "was a good challenge" [...] and [...] "one of those things where it's like, 'This is what I do. This is what I love.'" [...] She said, [...] "To have all that material and to be there in the moment ... I didn't want to be in any other place." [...] She found it exciting. Having waited for the moment [...] "for a long time," [...] {{it turned out to be}} [...] "a big pay-off." [...] She added: But I was a little nervous because this was definitely a very, very special episode. That was the biggest challenge to me; I was going in there knowing, 'This is the moment.' I kept having <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> laugh and leave set and play with my friends in the hair and makeup room and just sort of try to view the day as though it was just an average taping day because the last thing those scenes needed from my character's perspective was that sense of gravity, that feeling of, 'This is so important.' Because it was not a big deal for my character — she had no idea what was coming.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, Harry,' said he, 'you {{have some}} plot to ruin {{me by my}} own conceit; <b>to</b> <b>make</b> me blow <b>myself</b> out and destroy myself, poor frog that I am, in trying to loom as largely as that great cow, Fidus Neverbend.

The sacrifice which I yearn <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of <b>myself,</b> my hopes, my everything, is coldly put aside.
