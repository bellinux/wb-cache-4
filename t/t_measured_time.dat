40|$|The {{time scale}} Δ t parameter, which {{appears in the}} Bose-Einstein Correlations (BEC) treated in term of the Heisenberg {{uncertainty}} relations, is reexamined. Arguments are given {{for the role of}} Δ <b>t</b> as a <b>measure</b> of the particles' emission time rather than representing the strength property of the correlated particles. Thus in the analyzes of the Z^ 0 hadronic the Δ t given value of 10 ^- 24 seconds is the particles' emission time prescribed by the Z^ 0 lifetime. In heavy ion collisions Δ <b>t</b> <b>measures</b> the emission <b>time</b> duration of the particles produced from a nucleus of atomic number A which is here shown to be equal to Δ t =(m_πa^ 2) /(ħ c^ 2) *A^ 2 / 3 where a is about 1 fm, that is, proportional to the nucleus surface area.

40|$|Background. To assess upper {{extremity}} (UE) capabilities following stroke, the Wolf Motor Function <b>Test</b> (WMFT) <b>measures</b> <b>time</b> to complete 15 UE tasks and 2 strength tasks, but takes 30 to 45 {{minutes for the}} clinician to complete. Objective. In an effort to streamline the WMFT, this study evaluated the association between the magnitude of improvement on any timed task of the WMFT and the change score on all other tasks among participants in the Extremity Constraint Induced Therapy Evaluation (EXCITE) trial. Methods. This asso-ciation was evaluated using regression methods according to chronicity and controlling for key covariates (functional level, gender, concordance) for log mean WMFT scores. Results. After controlling for covariates, 6 tasks (hand to table [front], hand to box [front], reach and retrieve, lift can, lift pencil, and fold towel) influenced the overall WMFT score for survivors meeting EXCITE criteria and treated within 3 to 9 months poststroke. Six different tasks (extend elbow weight, hand to box [front], lift can, lift pencil, turn key in lock, and fold towel) influenced the overall WMFT score for those receiving constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) 1 year later. The importance of certain tasks relative to others may best represent overall UE function, but this streamlining enables the clinician to pri-oritize these tasks in the evaluation. Conclusions. The delineation of those tasks depends on the time poststroke from enrollment to CIMT. This study demonstrates that the WMFT can be streamlined from 17 to 6 tasks...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{extension}} of DUAL-STATIS to the sliced-inverse regression (SIR) framework is proposed to analyze multi-table datasets {{with respect to}} a numeric variable of interest. The method is designed to analyze the case where a data set X, which corresponds to a set of p variables <b>measured</b> <b>T</b> <b>times</b> on the same n subjects is related to a real target variable y, measured on the same n subjects. The approach is an exploratory method which aims at understanding the evolution of the relation between X and y through time. The method proceeds in two steps: 1) an inter-structure analysis studies the resemblance between the different time steps by computing similarities between estimates of the covariance of the mean of X_ [...] t conditional to y. Similarly to SIR, the conditional expectation is estimated by slicing the range of y. The result of this analysis is a compromise covariance matrix Γ^c, which captures a compromise correlation structure of E(X_ [...] t|y) over t; 2) an intra-structure analysis which is a generalized PCA of the compromise. This second step results in graphical outputs which can be used to explore the covariance structure between variables and time steps conditional to y. The method is illustrated on a real problem related to the consequences of a low calorie diet on obese persons in which the target variable of interest is the weight gain/loss...|$|R

A thin InGaAs stain reducing layer (SRL) is adopted which extends the emission wavelength to 1. 3 mu m {{and the influence of}} strain on QDs is investigated. The SRL releases the strain between the wetting layer and QDs, and enlarges the size of QDs, as shown by atomic force microscopy measurements. As the thickness of InAs layer decreases to 1. 7 ML, the QDs with the SRL are chained to strings and the density of QDs increases significantly, which leads to an abnormal redshift of 1. 3 mu m PL peak at room temperature. PL peaks of InAs QDs with the SRL show redshift compared with the QDs directly deposited on GaAs matrix. The dependences of PL lifetime on the QD size, density and temperature (T) are systematically studied. It is observed that the PL lifetime of QDs is insensitive to T below 50 K. Beyond 50 K, increases and then drops at higher temperature, with a peak at T(C), which was determined by the SRL and the thickness of InAs. We have also observed an obvious PL spectral redshift of the QDs with 1. 7 ML InAs coverage on SRL at low <b>T</b> as the <b>measuring</b> <b>time</b> delays. The PL lifetime of QDs with the SRL is smaller than that of QDs without the SRL. The QDs with different densities have different PL lifetime dependence on the QDs size.

40|$|We use a multi-taper method (refs. S 1,S 2) to {{estimate}} the coherence between climate proxy records and insolation. In particular, the climate proxy records are first linearly interpolated to a uniform spacing of 1 ka and the corresponding insolation intensity is calculated using the orbital solution of Berger and Loutre (ref. S 3). Although estimation of the coherence and phase is straightforward (ref. S 2), estimation of the uncertainty accompanying these estimates requires that the peculiarities of the time-series be accounted for. Significance levels for the coherence statistic have been tabulated for the case of stationary bivariate Gaussian processes (ref. S 4), but in the present context {{we are interested in}} the significance of the coherence between a red-noise climate signal and a narrow-band insolation signal, for which we are unaware of a theoretical treatment of the significance level. Thus, we resort to a Monte Carlo procedure {{to estimate}} the 95 % significance level between climate proxies and changes in insolation intensity.

40|$|Individual {{gamma ray}} bursts (GRBs) have very diverse time {{behavior}} - {{from a single}} pulse to a long complex sequence of chaotic pulses of different timescales. I studied light curves of GRBs {{using data from the}} CGRO's BATSE experiment and found that the average post-peak time history for a sample of 460 bursts obeys an unique and simple analytical law: I ∼(-(t/t_ 0) ^ 1 / 3) where <b>t</b> is <b>time</b> <b>measured</b> from the peak of the event and t_ 0 is a constant ranging from 0. 3 sec for strong bursts to ∼ 1 sec for weak bursts. The average peak aligned profile follows this law with good accuracy in the whole range availible for analysis (from fractions of a second to ∼ 150 seconds after the peak). Such a law with a single time constant characterising the overall sample of GRBs should have important physical meaning. The dependence of t_ 0 versus brightness of GRBs is presented. The fact that t_ 0 depends on the brightness apparantly confirms the recently discovered effect of time dilation of weak bursts which has a possible cosmological interpretation. The time dilation is detected at a confidence level of 7 σ and it is slightly larger than was previously reported.
