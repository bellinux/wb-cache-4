5|$|Romano and Senior {{argue that}} Antara's {{relationship}} with the government puts the agency at risk of engaging in self-censorship in recent years. Internal reforms immediately after 1998 did not completely eliminate the culture of cronyism {{that had come to}} characterize the relationship {{between the government and the}} press. The two note, however, that Antara journalists were given greater rights to affiliate and organize into unions <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> in other news organizations.|$|E
5|$|Thrasher and Blastus are {{two teenage}} robots {{who live on}} the planet of Insanus. Their planet is {{inhabited}} by murderous robots who seek to kill one another for no apparent reason. Slightly less horrific <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers,</b> the duo seek to make it through high school, and navigate their lives with mixed results. Thrasher (Patton Oswalt), a tall and lanky robot, wishes to gain the affections of an attractive female robot named Maimy (Jessie Cantrell). Meanwhile, Blastus (John Gemberling), a small and rotund robot, just wants to be popular. As with Blastus, unlike most robots on Insanus, he is mostly sensitive and non-criminal, much to the disapproval of his mother. In his quest to be cool, however, he is incredibly impulsive and overconfident in his abilities. Thrasher, though calm and reserved, often falls prey to Blastus' badly-thought out plans.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{these issues}} {{and the fact that}} Vietnamese {{children}} attend urban public schools that many middle-class families have abandoned, they are making significant progress in education. Vietnamese adolescents are less likely <b>than</b> <b>their</b> American <b>peers</b> to drop out of high school, and Vietnamese young adults were more likely <b>than</b> <b>their</b> American <b>peers</b> to attend college.|$|R
50|$|LGBT {{students}} {{report a}} higher prevalence of violence at school <b>than</b> <b>their</b> non-LGBT <b>peers.</b> In New Zealand, for example, lesbian, gay and bisexual students were {{three times more}} likely to be bullied <b>than</b> <b>their</b> heterosexual <b>peers</b> and in Norway 15-48 per cent of lesbian, gay and bisexual students reported being bullied compared with 7 per cent of heterosexual students.|$|R
50|$|Second, severe {{homesickness}} {{is associated}} with significant distress and impairment. There is evidence that homesick persons present with non-traumatic physical ailments significantly more <b>than</b> <b>their</b> non-homesick <b>peers.</b> Homesick boys and girls complain about somatic problems and exhibit more internalizing and externalizing behaviors problems <b>than</b> <b>their</b> nonhomesick <b>peers.</b> First-year college students are {{three times more likely}} to drop out of school <b>than</b> <b>their</b> nonhomesick <b>peers.</b> Other data have pointed to concentration and academic problems in homesick students. And maladjustment to separation from home has been documented in hospitalized young people and is generally associated with slower recovery. See Thurber & Walton (2012) for a review.|$|R

40|$|Much {{work has}} {{documented}} that African-American {{students are more}} likely to receive expulsions and suspensions <b>than</b> <b>their</b> white <b>peers.</b> These disparities are troubling, but researchers and policymakers need more information to fully understand this issue. We use three years of student level discipline data for an entire state to assess whether non-white students are receiving different disciplinary consequences from <b>their</b> white <b>peers</b> in the same schools, for similar infractions and with similar behavioral history. We find that Black students received more severe (longer) punishments <b>than</b> <b>their</b> White <b>peers</b> in the state for the same types of infractions. These differences are due primarily to school-level differences, but even within the same schools, Black students receive slightly longer punishments <b>than</b> <b>their</b> White <b>peers...</b>|$|R

25|$|During World War I, {{about eight}} million men {{surrendered}} and {{were held in}} POW camps until the war ended. All nations pledged to follow the Hague rules on fair treatment of prisoners of war, and in general the POWs had a much higher survival rate <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> who were not captured. Individual surrenders were uncommon; usually a large unit surrendered all its men. At Tannenberg 92,000 Russians surrendered during the battle. When the besieged garrison of Kaunas surrendered in 1915, 20,000 Russians became prisoners. Over half the Russian losses were prisoners {{as a proportion of}} those captured, wounded or killed. About 3.3 million men became prisoners.|$|E
25|$|When Cruzado {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} of Montana State University, the Board of Regents {{expressed concern about the}} faculty. Faculty generally taught 23 percent more courses <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> elsewhere in the nation (although classes were generally small, just 10 to 29 students), spending on students was 17.7 percent below the national average of $15,094 per student, just 72 percent of its freshmen returned for their sophomore year, and more than half its students failed to graduate. A troubling trend, the regents said, was MSU's over-reliance on adjunct faculty. in the 2009-2010 school year, MSU had 469 tenured or tenure-track faculty, but its 345 adjunct faculty accounted for 42 percent of all faculty.|$|E
2500|$|One area of {{criticism}} {{that has gone}} silent is the mis-perception that Greek students' grades suffer. [...] Rather, the contrary is true. [...] Fraternity Men's grades nationally were cited in a 1986 study by the Center for the Study of the College Fraternity as trending above the men's average, with the women's groups trending even higher in comparison to their baseline. This trend has continued: A survey of both men's and women's grades {{over the past three}} years at Minnesota confirms the same result - Greeks perform academically better <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>peer</b> averages.|$|R

40|$|Adolescence {{constitutes}} a major transition for extremely {{low birth weight}} (ELBW) teenagers. Recent studies of ELBW teenagers born in the 1980 s have provided information about the growth and developmental characteristics of these individuals in adolescence and in early adulthood. ELBW teenagers are shorter and lighter <b>than</b> <b>their</b> full-term <b>peers,</b> and have a smaller head circumference. Cognitive and academic vulnerabilities documented during the school years, particularly difficulties with nonverbal intelligence and arithmetic, persist into late adolescence. Many ELBW children struggle in school and have lower academic achievement levels. The self-concept of ELBW teenagers is generally {{similar to that of}} <b>their</b> full-term <b>peers,</b> but <b>their</b> parents perceive them to be more vulnerable over a wide range of behavioural and psychosocial dimensions, particularly depression and attention. ELBW teenagers perceive themselves as needing more assistance in job seeking <b>than</b> do <b>their</b> <b>peers.</b> Physical activity levels and fitness in late adolescence are significantly lower in ELBW teenagers <b>than</b> in <b>their</b> full-term <b>peers,</b> constituting a potential additional health hazard in later life. The outcomes of ELBW teenagers are significantly influenced by socioeconomic, family and parenting factors...|$|R
25|$|Private higher {{education}} institutions cannot operate {{if they are not}} recognized by the Ministry of Education. Access is regulated by the same procedures as those for state {{higher education}} institutions. The two systems of higher education (university and polytechnic) are linked and it is possible to transfer {{from one to the other}} by extraordinary competition. It is also possible to transfer from a public institution to a private one and vice versa. Admission to public university programmes are often more demanding and selective than to their equivalent in public polytechnic and private institutions. Many specific university institutions and degrees are also regarded as more prestigious and reputed <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> from the polytechnic system or from certain less notable university institutions.|$|E
25|$|Aché {{demography}} {{has been}} extensively studied and analyzed {{in the framework of}} evolutionary life history theory. Major causes of death in the forest period were in-group homicides (especially of infants and children), external warfare, respiratory disease, tropical fevers, and accidents. Over 40% of all adult deaths, and more than 60% of all child deaths, were due to violence by other Aché or by outsiders. In the forest period, about 65% of all children born survived to adulthood (age 15), and life expectancy for those young adults was an additional 40 years on average. Fertility was high, with completed family sizes of post reproductive women being just over 8 live births. Analyses indicate that high return hunters, and large bodied women, had higher lifetime reproductive success <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers.</b> More detailed information relevant to theories about body size variation, age at menarche, menopause, life history tradeoffs, etc. are presented in Hill and Hurtado's 1996 Aché Life History.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} puberty can have {{important}} {{psychological and social}} consequences. Early maturing boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends. They have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming hand-picked for sports. Pubescent boys often {{tend to have a}} good body image, are more confident, secure, and more independent. Late maturing boys can be less confident because of poor body image when comparing themselves to already developed friends and peers. However, early puberty is not always positive for boys; early sexual maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that affect them. Because they appear older <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers,</b> pubescent boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms; society may view them as more emotionally advanced, despite the fact that their cognitive and social development may lag behind their appearance. Studies have shown that early maturing boys {{are more likely to be}} sexually active and are more likely to participate in risky behaviors.|$|E

500|$|Engs {{notes that}} missionaries {{struggled}} {{to reconcile the}} task of assimilating discriminated peoples into a society that defined itself by that active discrimination. Engs portrays Armstrong as a natural politician, administrator, and [...] "risk-taker" [...] who sought broad-based support from opposed parties, including African Americans, the [...] "anti-Negro white South", and white philanthropists of the North, which made Armstrong into a [...] "master prevaricator". As a [...] "realist", Armstrong adopted the subtleties of his patrons to keep Hampton open, and did not confuse [...] "the uplift of African Americans" [...] with [...] "promoting their equality with whites". Hampton's curriculum was ultimately set by federal and donor money. In time, Armstrong's goals for the school were derailed by increased costs and the school's Northern industrialist backers, who made manual labor education the focus {{and end of the}} curriculum, rather than a means. Engs concludes that Armstrong's black graduates lived in better circumstances <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers.</b> Many became teachers in the South and were [...] "grateful" [...] for their opportunities. Reversely, Hampton's Native American graduates suffered in health at the school and had little job opportunity back out West. Engs also concluded that Armstrong's work was limited by his reliance on the elite, emphasis on white men deciding black lives, and inability to change his philosophy when his assumptions became outdated. Still, Engs thought that Armstrong succeeded in his intent to [...] "civilize" [...] students at Hampton, though this mattered little, Engs wrote, when white society was unprepared to accept them [...] "no matter how civilized they might be".|$|E
2500|$|One {{result of}} the {{prevalence}} of the [...] "mateship" [...] culture is that Australian society is stringently anti-hierarchical. Australians are expected to behave with humility and not {{think of themselves as}} better <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers.</b> Any disloyalty to their [...] "mates" [...] is treated harshly, and is known as the tall poppy syndrome, where people who grow greater <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> are harshly criticised as being narcissistic, or [...] "up themselves". Even the most successful and beautiful Australians are eager to proclaim how ordinary they are, to the extent that two-thirds of the highest earning households define themselves as middle class, lower middle class or even working class. This egalitarian social system makes Australian society appear [...] "laid-back" [...] or relaxed to visitors. Most forms of address are by first name or nickname, and only children regularly use titles such as [...] "Sir" [...] or [...] "Ma'am" [...] for authority figures.|$|E
