30|$|Nanowires of two {{different}} morphologies are recalled here: in one case, we have the tapering just restricted to the base, as seen in Figure 4 b, and another where we see a continuous decrease in nanowire diameter with length, as in Figure 3 b–e; both morphologies can be explained {{on the basis of}} the rate at which the Zn atoms are deposited/delivered to the substrate if the temperature is kept constant. The concentration of the Zn adatoms at the substrate will increase as the Ar carrier gas flow rates are increased. Due to the concentration gradient between the substrate surface and the nanowire, diffusion of the adatoms becomes prominent at flow rates > 140 sccm. Excess growth species are available at the base of the ZnO nanowire, where the mobility of Zn atoms diffusing from the substrate surface to the nanowire tip is impeded and allows radial tapering of the base [13]. The base diameter thus increases steadily with an increase in flow rates. This gives rise to tapered, as in Figure 4 b, but not needle-shaped nanowires, as in Figure 3. Further, it is to be noticed that the <b>tapered</b> <b>segment</b> of the nanowire in Figure 4 b is very small. This is probably due to the limitation of adatom diffusion via the nanowire sidewall, since the upward adatom mobility via the nanowire sidewalls decreases at high temperatures [14]. However, as the flow rates are increased further, the tapered nanowires give way to needle-like nanowires, obtained in this case at a flow rate of 160 sccm as shown in Figure 3 b–e where there is a constant decrease in diameter with length. Such observations have been reported previously in the growth of InAs nanowires [13]. The tapering also indicates that adatom surface diffusion from the substrate up the nanowire sidewalls forms a path for the growth species reaching the alloy droplet other than the direct impingement of the atoms on the droplet, as has been reported previously [13]. A theoretical study [15] investigating the shape of the nanowires {{on the basis of the}} contact angle β of the liquid droplet at the nanowire tip found surprisingly that tapered nanowire growth (∂ > 0) is more likely for a wide range of contact angles β compared to nanowires with uniform diameters.|$|E

Root branching and <b>tapering</b> rates, <b>segment</b> <b>taper,</b> classical (P) and new architectural parameters related to branching patterns were computed.

40|$|A new {{technique}} on friction aided deep drawing has been proposed. A metal blank holder {{was designed to}} be of two layers: stationary layer or base with four planes of 5 degrees taper angle and moving layer divided into four <b>tapered</b> <b>segments.</b> Under appropriate blank holding force, these four segments can move radially to the die opening with a constant speed by using a specially designed compression tool. The main function of this developed blank holding device is adopting the frictional force between the blank and the blank holder to work in the useful drawing direction likewise the function of the rubber ring used in Maslennikov's process. Drawing deformation is efficiently performed by using an assistant metal punch, which is supplemented with a hydraulic cylinder to provide a constant punch force during the drawing process. The drawing mechanism and the effects of drawing conditions are mainly investigated to characterize the merits and defects of the proposed process. Since successful deep cups of drawing ratio 3. 76 have been produced the possibility of the present technique is already confirmed, however, further investigations are needed to enhance the drawing efficiency.

40|$|Quarter {{wavelength}} resonator (QWR) based deflecting cavities {{with the}} capability of supporting multiple odd-harmonic modes {{have been developed for}} an ultrafast periodic kicker system in the proposed Jefferson Lab Electron Ion Collider (JLEIC, formerly MEIC). Previous work on the kicking pulse synthesis and the transverse beam dynamics tracking simulations show that a flat-top kicking pulse can be generated with minimal emittance growth during injection and circulation of the cooling electron bunches. This flat-top kicking pulse can be obtained when a DC component and 10 harmonic modes with appropriate amplitude and phase are combined together. To support 10 such harmonic modes, four QWR cavities are used with 5, 3, 1, and 1 modes, respectively.

Although stent post-dilatation to larger diameter is commonly done, typically {{in the setting of}} long <b>tapering</b> <b>segment</b> or left-main PCI, there is an increasing recognition that information with regard to the different stent model designs has a critical impact on overexpansion results. This study aims to provide an update on stent model designs for contemporary DES platforms as well as test overexpansion results under with oversized post-dilatation. Methods and resultsWe studied 6 different contemporary commercially available DES platforms: Synergy, Xience Xpedition, Ultimaster, Orsiro, Resolute Onyx and Biomatrix Alpha. We investigated for each platform the difference in stent designs across different sizes and results obtained after post-expansion with larger balloon sizes. The stents were deployed at nominal diameter and subsequently over expanded using increasingly large post dilatation balloon sizes (4. 0, 5. 0 and 6. 0 mm at 14 ATM). Light microscopy was used to measure the changes in stent geometry and lumen diameter after over-expansion. For each respective DES platform, the MLD observed after overexpansion of the largest stent size available with a 6. 0 mm balloon was 5. 7 mm for Synergy, 5. 6 mm for Xience, 5. 2 mm for Orsiro, 5. 8 mm for Ultimaster, 5. 5 mm for 4 mm Onyx (5. 9 mm for the 5 mm XL size) and 5. 8 mm for BioMatrix Chroma. ConclusionThis update presents valuable novel insights that may be helpful for careful selection of stent size for contemporary DES based on model designs.

In general, the finding in the current study points to a region in the neighbourhood of 50  % of total height as being the best point to measure an upper stem diameter to be included in a DH+ taper model, similar to what some previous studies have found (e.g. Kozak 1998; Arias-Rodil et al. 2015).

60|$|According to {{a popular}} impression, {{the absence of a}} tail is eminently {{distinctive}} of man; but as those apes which come nearest to man are destitute of this organ, its disappearance does not especially concern us. Nevertheless it may be well to own that no explanation, as far as I am aware, has ever been given of the loss of the tail by certain apes and man. Its loss, however, is not surprising, for it sometimes differs remarkably in length in species of the same genera: thus in some species of Macacus the tail is longer than the whole body, consisting of twenty-four vertebræ; in others it consists of a scarcely visible stump, containing only three or four vertebræ. In some kinds of baboons there are twenty-five, whilst in the mandrill there are ten very small stunted caudal vertebræ, or, according to Cuvier,[218] sometimes only five. This great diversity in the structure and length of the tail in animals belonging to the same genera, and following nearly the same habits of life, renders it probable that the tail is not of much importance to them; and if so, we might have expected that it would sometimes have become more or less rudimentary, in accordance with what we incessantly see with other structures. The tail almost always tapers towards the end whether it be long or short; and this, I presume, results from the atrophy, through disuse, of the terminal muscles together with their arteries and nerves, leading to the atrophy of the terminal bones. With respect to the os coccyx, which in man and the higher apes manifestly consists of the few basal and <b>tapering</b> <b>segments</b> of an ordinary tail, I have heard it asked how could these have become completely embedded within the body; but there is no difficulty in this respect, for in many monkeys the basal segments of the true tail are thus embedded. For instance, Mr. Murie informs me that in the skeleton of a not full-grown Macacus inornatus, he counted nine or ten caudal vertebræ, which altogether were only 1·8 inch in length. Of these the three basal ones appeared to have been embedded; the remainder forming the free part of the tail, which was only one inch in length, and half an inch in diameter. Here, then, the three embedded caudal vertebræ plainly correspond with the four coalesced vertebræ of the human os coccyx.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{internal}} variables (e. g. temperature, {{consistency and}} fiber residence time) are introduced and defined as physical states obtained {{in different parts}} of the refining zones. In short, they differ from the traditional external variables (e. g. dilution water feed rate and specific energy), which are not available as distributed variables from refining zone measurements.

40|$|In {{hydraulic}} systems with multiple actuators, difficulty can arise with matching the load requirements with the supply {{power from the}} system's pump. To get the desired performance at the individual loads, restrictive type valves are used to control pressure or flow by throttling the flow over a spool orifice, creating considerable power loss. This causes {{hydraulic systems}} powered off the same pump to be inefficient. Switched inertance hydraulic systems are a new technology {{in the field of}} fluid power that convert pressure and flow more efficiently than using restrictive type hydraulic valves. The step-down, or "buck", converter considered exclusively in this thesis has the ability to reduce pressure and increase flow rate to a load. The system is constructed using a digital hydraulic valve and check valve connected to the pressure supply and system reservoir respectfully. Following the valves, the system has an inertance tube, a long piece of uniform hydraulic line where fluid inertia is built up. The inertance tube also causes pressure wave propagation effects to occur since the length of the line is typically long. The performance of switched inertance converters are largely governed by the performance of the switching valve. An ideal switched inertance converter is 100 % efficient at converting pressure and flow, however this would require the valve to actuate at extremely high frequency and switch instantaneously fast. This is not realizable as real valves operate up to a maximum of a couple hundred Hertz, and take a finite time to open and close, on the order of milliseconds. One of the main losses of a buck converter is the power loss across the switching valve as it transitions from open to closed and vice versa. This loss arises from the throttling of flow over the valve opening during actuation. The research presented in this thesis looks at mitigating this loss, as well as the viscous friction loss within the inertance tube. These losses can be reduced by using an inertance tube of variable shape, a new idea introduced very recently. A shaped inertance tube is a fluid pipeline with varying cross sectional area over its length, as compared to uniform inertance tubes which have constant cross sectional area. The current gap in the research is that the tube design is not fully optimized leaving room for potential improvements in identifying better dimensions, or perhaps finding a more optimal shape. Models for computing fluid transients in uniform lines are well developed, however modelling fluid dynamics in shaped inertance tubes is an area that has not been studied as extensively. The research presented proposes a computer model for simulating fluid transients in <b>tapered</b> transmission line <b>segments</b> using the transmission line method (TLM). The current research gap in modelling tapered transmission lines is that previous models are difficult to simulate in the time domain, have poor accuracy, and have a limited range of applicability. The proposed TLM model looks to mitigate these shortcomings. When connected in succession, the tapered TLM can model shaped inertance tubes for application to hydraulic buck converters. The proposed model shows improved agreement to a numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations than the previous models on the topic. Validation of the model is also gained though analysis of the dynamic response in the frequency domain. With the model now available to simulate shaped inertance tubes, a buck converter system is defined with equations presented for dynamic simulation. Initial simulations of the buck converter using parameters and design from previous research showed unoptimized performance operating at an efficiency of 47. 8 % for a system using a uniform inertance tube. The main objective was to optimize the shape of the inertance tube to realize increased performance using simulation studies. Genetic and pattern search algorithms were used to optimize the dimensions of the inertance tube with the goal of maximizing system efficiency while maintaining the same load. As a baseline, the uniform intertance tube design was optimized, and realized an efficiency of 64. 1 %, performing significantly better than the unoptimized uniform inertance tube. Further optimizations added an increasing number of tapered sections to describe the arbitrary shape of an inertance tube, up to 4 <b>tapered</b> <b>segments.</b> Significant efficiency increases were realized when using shaped inertance tubes. The best tube design increased system efficiency over 6 % compared to the uniform design at a value of 70. 2 %. Other optimizations showed improvements in efficiency over the traditional design by reducing both valve and frictional losses in the system. The research presents a novel inertance tube design, containing a uniform section of high inertance followed by a diverging tapered section followed by another uniform section at larger diameter and low resistance. This design also proposes the idea of potential noise reduction due to the suppression of pressure fluctuations at the load...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To present our {{experience}} of laparoscopic ureteral reimplantation using intracorporeal ureteral tapering for management of distal ureteral stricture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 2005 and October 2008, six patients, including 3 children and 3 adults, underwent laparoscopic modified Lich-Gregoir type extravesical ureteral reimplantation for distal ureteral stricture. Significant dilatations of proximal segment in these patients were repaired with intracorporeal ureteral tapering. Stricture etiologies were congenital ureterovesical megaureter and iatrogenic gynecologic injury in 4 and 2 patients, respectively. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 29. 3 years (range, 2 to 62 years). Mean operation time and hospital stay was 185 minutes (range, 150 to 240 minutes) and 4 days (range, 2 to 6 days), respectively. No significant complications were noted intra-operatively. Surgical procedure was performed in all the subjects laparoscopically and no conversion to open surgery happened. Postoperatively, 2 patients were complicated with febrile urinary tract infection that were managed medically. No urinary leakage occurred in early postoperative period. All the patients had patent ureterovesical junction anastomosis in follow-up imaging and recurrence of obstruction was noted in no cases. Two patients (33. 3 %) developed grade II vesicoureteral reflux.

It can provide two different types of products, a non-wood product (benzoin resin) and timber. In Laos, the most important product is currently resin, and the use of timber for commercial purposes is rare. One reason is that information about the timber is not available. In Vietnam, on the other hand, the species is an import pulpwood species. Data used in this study came from 73 trees. Trees were purposely selected to ensure coverage of a full range of tree sizes. Measurement was undertaken only on over-bark diameters due to some constraints, limitations and problems during the field data collection. However, due to the importance of under-bark volume for this species, a small available dataset was used to build a bark model as an interim guide to the errors associated with using over-bark models for estimating under-bark volumes. From this bark model, errors in estimating under-bark volumes of trees with diameters at breast height between 10 cm and 17 cm were approximately 18 %. Nineteen individual volume models, and 7 individual taper functions were compared for bias and precision. Collective names for the volume equations tested include single-entry, double-entry, logarithmic, combined variables. Most volume models had similar bias but a few were clearly biased. The models with similar bias were further evaluated by four common statistics including bias, standard error of estimates, standard deviation of residuals and mean absolute deviation. The results showed that a five parameter model was ranked first, and was the most precise model. However, the magnitudes of difference in prediction errors between this model and other models, particularly the three parameter model were not significant. For practical purposes, the simpler model was preferred. Seven taper functions tested here belong to three different groups including single taper equations, compatible <b>taper</b> equations and <b>segmented</b> <b>taper</b> equations. Evaluation of taper equations used the same residual analysis procedures and criteria as those applied with volume equations. Graphical residual analysis showed that most taper models had similar precision with their errors in diameter predictions being similar in range. However, some models showed obvious bias. The most highly ranked taper model was a compatible taper model of polynomial form. It was the least biased model. The second ranked model was a single, simple model. This latter model is relatively simple to apply, but it is not compatible with the volume model, yielding slightly different estimates of volume if it is integrated and rotated around the longitudinal axis of a tree. However, if the sole purpose is to describe tree taper, it is the best model to use...|$|R
30|$|Similar to {{the results}} with the <b>segmented</b> <b>taper</b> model in Sabatia and Burkhart (2015), use of the best upper stem diameters in the {{polynomial}} model {{in the current study}} mainly improved the performance of the taper model in the upper half of the tree bole (Figs.  3 and 4). Consequently, volumes of tree boles that are longer than 50  % of the tree’s total height will be predicted more precisely by a DH+ taper model than they would be predicted by a DH model. On the other hand, tree boles that do not include, or only include a small part of, the stem portion above 50  % of total height are unlikely to be predicted differently by a DH+ taper model compared to how they would be predicted by a DH one. This explains the observation that the decrease in volume prediction error, due to use of the M 3 _HABH taper model, was largest for total aboveground volume and smallest for sawtimber volume (Table  4). Sawtimber top diameter limits were, on average, at a relative height of 60  % for trees in the split-validation data set and at a relative height of 67  % for those in the independent-validation data set. Pulpwood top diameter limits were, on average, at a relative height of 78 and 81  % for trees in the split-validation and for those in the independent-validation data sets, respectively.|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{assessed}} {{the performance of}} different types of taper equations for predicting tree diameters at specific heights and total stem volumes for mixed stands of Taurus cedar (Cedrus libani A. Rich.) and Taurus fir (Abies cilicica Carr.). We used data from mixed stands containing a total of 131 cedar and 124 Taurus fir trees. We evaluated six commonly used and well-known forestry taper functions developed by a variety of researchers (Biging (1984), Zakrzewski (1999), Muhairwe (1999), Fang et al. (2000), Kozak (2004), and Sharma and Zhang (2004)). To address problems related to autocorrelation and multicollinearity in the hierarchical data associated with the construction of taper models, we used appropriate statistical procedures for the model fitting. We compared model performances based on the analysis of three goodness-of-fit statistics and found the compatible segmented model of Fang et al. (2000) to be superior in describing the stem profile and stem volume of both tree species in mixed stands. The equation used by Zakrzewski (1999) exhibited the poorest fitting results of the three taper equations. In general, we found <b>segmented</b> <b>taper</b> equations to provide more accurate predictions than variable-form models for both tree species. Results from the non-linear extra sum of squares method indicate that stem tapers differ among tree species in mixed stands. Therefore, a different taper function should be used for each tree species in mixed stands in the Bucak district. Using individual-specific taper equations yields more robust estimations and, therefore, will enhance the prediction accuracy of diameters at different heights and volumes in mixed stands...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prices of}} fossil fuels during the last decades have sparked increasing interest and investments in wind power plants to expand their share of electricity production and improve windmill technology with new and more economical inventions and sustainable solutions. A RFCS (research fund for coal and steel) research project called HISTWIN has the aim to improve the competitiveness of the windmill towers made of steel. The towers for high power wind generators often consist of several cylindrical slightly <b>tapered</b> steel <b>segments</b> connected by bolted flanges. This is a traditional and well established solution. One {{part of the project}} is to examine if a friction connection can be used instead of the traditional flange connection, because the friction connection will introduce two mprovements: it is expected to have higher fatigue class, leading to less steel consumption and the tower will be faster to assemble. The proposed friction connection is a lap connection bolted with tension control bolts, TC-bolts. One plate of the connection has normal sized holes while the other plate has long open slots. This solution is expected to reduce the total cost of the tower with at least 10 %. The main objective of this report is to establish structural characteristics of static behavior and the ks factor for this type of connection according to Eurocode and to investigate the performance of TC-bolts in the connection. The ks factor is a factor that reduces the slip resistance for friction connections in EN 1993 - Part 1 - 8 regarding size of holes used in the connection. There are no specific rules for long open slots in EN 1993 - Part 1 - 8 which are used in the proposed connection. Another aim of this report is to evaluate different ways to control the preload. The objective is to evaluate properties of TC-bolts and its competitiveness. The ks factor is evaluated from four groups of specimens. The tested specimens have two types of surfaces and have three different configurations of bolt placement in the specimens. Design of the tower connections are done with the experimentally obtained ks factor for a lap connection and comparison is made with an ordinary flange connection. The results in this report shows that the use of TC-bolts is a very competitive method to control the preload with respect to speed of installation, and that the bolts perform well under various conditions and treatments. The experiments done in this report shows that the proposed connection has a ks factor equal to 0, 75 as the connections are prevented from in-plane rotation, this can be compared with the ks factor for long slotted holes which is equal to 0, 63. Economical calculations show that if a lap connection with long open slots is used instead of an ordinary flange connection, the cost will be reduced by more than 85 % per connection in a wind tower. These calculations are done with respect to price of flanges and bolts provided by HISTWIN partners. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
