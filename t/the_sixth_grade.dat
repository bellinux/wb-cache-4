5|$|In {{the public}} school system of Baltimore city, music {{education}} is a part of each grade level to high school, at which point it becomes optional. Beginning in first grade, or approximately six years old, Baltimore students begin to learn about melody, harmony and rhythm, and are taught to echo short melodic and rhythmic patterns. They also begin to learn about different musical instruments and distinguish between different kinds of sounds and types of songs. As students progress through the grades, teachers go into more detail and require more proficiency in elementary musical techniques. Students perform rounds in second grade, for example, while movement (i.e. dance) enters the curriculum in third grade. Beginning in middle school in <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>grade,</b> students are taught to make mature aesthetic judgements, and to understand and respond to a variety of forms of music.

5|$|Maho is Shuichi's sister. She is {{one year}} older than Shuichi is, and at the {{beginning}} of Wandering Son, she is in <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>grade</b> of elementary school. Maho shows a strong interest in clothes, and spends much of her money on new apparel. She is a big fan of a teen fashion model named Maiko, and to meet her, Maho auditions for the same modeling agency as Maiko.

While her modeling career initially starts out slowly, Maho soon gains confidence in her abilities, and becomes friends with Maiko and two other models, Anna Suehiro and Tamaki Satō. In contrast to her younger sibling, Maho is very out-spoken and tends to be rough with Shuichi, even hitting or slapping Shuichi on occasion, and she often forces things on Shuichi with little consideration of Shuichi's opinion. She does not like Shuichi's cross-dressing and gets angry and disturbed when she finds Shuichi dressed as a girl.

40|$|Objective This article tested whether {{disordered eating}} in <b>the</b> spring of <b>sixth</b> <b>grade</b> can be {{predicted}} by the behaviors of fifth grade elementary school children. Method Measurements of disordered eating were col-lected from 1906 children (mean age 10. 86 years) at Time 1 (spring of fifth grade), Time 2 (fall of <b>sixth</b> <b>grade),</b> and Time 3 (spring of <b>sixth</b> <b>grade).</b> Results A number of fifth grade children reported disordered eating during the previous 2 weeks: 12. 1 % reported objective binge episodes, 4. 8 % reported purging food, and 9. 8 % reported restricting food intake. These behaviors predicted disordered eating during <b>the</b> spring of <b>sixth</b> <b>grade.</b> In addition, fifth grade pubertal onset predicted higher levels of restricting for girls. Conclusion A substantial number of fifth grade children reported disordered eating behaviors, and these behaviors predicted disordered eating behaviors in <b>the</b> spring of <b>sixth</b> <b>grade.</b> Disordered eating can be studied at least as early as fifth grade.
