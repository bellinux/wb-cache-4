On the island, the unemployment rate continued to rise and many Puerto Ricans who were unable to find a job looked to the Armed Forces of the United States as a source of employment.

5|$|He {{opened his}} first Butlin's camp at Ingoldmells, near Skegness, on 11 April 1936 (Easter eve). It was officially opened by Amy Johnson, {{the first woman}} to fly solo from England to Australia. An {{advertisement}} costing £500 (2011:£) was placed in the Daily Express, announced the opening of the camp, inviting the public to book for a week's holiday. The advertisement offered holidays with <b>three</b> <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> and free entertainment with a week's full board cost anything from 35 shillings to £3 (2011:£), according to the time of year. When the camp opened, Butlin realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had planned; most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman Bradford (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests, which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By {{the end of the night}} the camp was buzzing and the Butlin's atmosphere was born. From that point on, entertainment was the very heart of Butlins and Bradford became the first of the Butlin's Redcoats. The same night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require many more people to carry out the same job as Bradford, and the role of Redcoat was conceived.|$|E

During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, the eating patterns change to sehri and iftar. It is considered proper to eat only with the right hand as per Islamic tradition (also a tradition in many other Asian cultures). Many Pakistani families, particularly when guests are too many to fit at a table, eat sitting at a cloth known as Dastarkhān, which is {{spread out on the}} floor. In Pakistan, many street eateries serve food on a takht, in a style similar to what is seen in Afghanistan.

Pakistanis often eat with their hands, scooping up solid food along with sauce with a piece of baked bread (naan) or rice.|$|E

500|$|Although {{all of the}} orphanage's {{residents}} were given a dose of Epsom salts once {{a week in the}} morning, some former residents have given accounts of brutal punishments and mistreatment. One states that because there were 200 boys and only 12 toilets, some would defecate in the urinals, drains, on the grass, or in their pants. As a result, the boys would receive beltings for doing this. Another account by a boy who stayed at the orphanage states that when he arrived there, he was separated from his brother and was given a set of clothes to wear despite having his own. Anyone who did not comply would receive a belting. The boys were issued no underwear and clothes were [...] washed only once a week. Beatings were common, and not just for punishment; sometimes it may have been more for mental scarring. Other accounts claim there were beatings, and repetitive rape, not only by the staff but also by older boys and the orphanage caretaker.
