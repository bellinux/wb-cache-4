5|$|<b>The</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> make {{teaching}} or research models of mathematical forms naturally creates objects that have symmetries and surprising or pleasing shapes.

5|$|Some {{of those}} who have {{attempted}} to find an escape from <b>the</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> power have resorted to forms of quietism or pacifism. One major proponent of such approaches was the philosopher Laozi. From Russell's perspective, such views are incoherent, since they only deny themselves coercive power, but retain an interest in persuading others to their cause; and persuasion is a form of power, for Russell. Moreover, he argues that the love of power can actually be a good thing. For instance, if one feels a certain duty towards their neighbours, they may attempt to attain power to help those neighbours (Russell 1938:215–216). In sum, the focus of any policy should not be on a ban on kinds of power, but rather, on certain kinds of use of power (Russell 1938:221).|$|E

50|$|The {{process of}} {{understanding}} how sound {{travels to the}} brain is imperative in understanding how and why disease can cause a person to develop hearing loss. The process is as follows: sound waves are transmitted to the outer ear, sound waves are conducted down to ear canal, bringing the sound waves to the eardrum which they cause to vibrate, these vibrations are now passed through the 3 tiny ear bones in the middle ear, which transfer the vibrations to the fluid in the inner ear, the fluid moves the hair cells, {{the movement of the}} hair cells cause the vibrations to be converted into nerve <b>impulses,</b> <b>the</b> nerve <b>impulses</b> are taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain by the auditory nerve, the auditory nerve takes <b>the</b> <b>impulses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> medulla oblongata, the brainstem send <b>the</b> <b>impulses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> midbrain, which finally goes to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe to be interpreted as sound.|$|R
5|$|From the mid-twentieth century, public {{architecture}} {{became more}} utilitarian, {{as part of}} <b>the</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> produce a comprehensive welfare state {{and the influence of}} modernism. The main thrust of post-war planning was in clearance and rebuilding. The process began in Paisley, where from 1955 the populations of districts were decanted, the buildings demolished and rebuilding began. The result in the first district, George Street/ Canal Street, were low flats built in render and reused rubble around landscaped courtyards, with a 15-storey tower at one end. As the post-war desire for urban regeneration gained momentum it would focus on the tower block, championed in Glasgow by David Gibson, convener of the city housing committee. Projects like the brutalist Red Road Flats (1964–69) originally offered hope of a new beginning and an escape from the overcrowded nineteenth-century tenements of the city, but lacked a sufficient infrastructure and soon deteriorated. They also made extensive use of asbestos as a fire retardant, leading to long term health problems for builders and residents. Robert Matthew (1906–75) and Basil Spence (1907–76) were responsible for redeveloping the Gorbals in Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion and {{the movement}} of arms and legs – is generated in the motor cortex, divided into three parts: the primary motor cortex, found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary motor area. The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit <b>the</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.|$|E

25|$|Beginners tend {{to point}} with the rod {{to where they}} want to throw, but the {{movement}} of the hand has to be a controlled speed-up and then come to an abrupt stop. The rod will then start to unfurl and the tip of the rod will reach a high speed in the required direction. The high speed of the rod tip toward the target gives <b>the</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> make the cast, the abrupt stop and retreat of the rod tip is essential for the formation of a loop. Experienced fishermen also improve the speed of the line leaving the rod tip by a technique called hauling, applying a quick fast pull with the hand holding the line. At the end of the cast when the line is stretched the line as a whole will still have speed and the fisherman can let some extra line through their fingers making a false throw, either forward or backward or to finish the cast and start fishing.|$|E

25|$|Pendulums (unlike, for example, quartz crystals) have a {{low enough}} Q that the {{disturbance}} caused by <b>the</b> <b>impulses</b> <b>to</b> keep them moving is generally the limiting factor on their timekeeping accuracy. Therefore, {{the design of the}} escapement, the mechanism that provides these impulses, has a large effect on the accuracy of a clock pendulum. If <b>the</b> <b>impulses</b> given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pendulum by the escapement each swing could be exactly identical, the response of the pendulum would be identical, and its period would be constant. However, this is not achievable; unavoidable random fluctuations in the force due to friction of the clock's pallets, lubrication variations, and changes in the torque provided by the clock's power source as it runs down, mean that the force of <b>the</b> <b>impulse</b> applied by <b>the</b> escapement varies.|$|R

The {{will of the}} customer may be thwarted through fraud or deception, but this at least may be beneficial in providing the customer with the symbolic pleasure of some material goods. Voluntary organisations are able to threaten , such as expulsion, on its members. Voluntary organisations serve the positive function of providing relatively benign outlets for the human passion for drama, and for <b>the</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> power.

In Glasgow, with its central gridiron plan, this followed the practice in the United States of filling up entire blocks and building steel framed buildings {{as high as the}} fire marshal would allow, as in the heavily American-influenced Union Bank building (1924) at St Vincent Street. From the mid-twentieth century, public architecture became more utilitarian, as part of <b>the</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> produce a comprehensive welfare state. Thomas S. Tait (1882–1954) was among the most important modernist architects of the era, using pyramidal stepped designs for buildings like the St Andrew's House, Edinburgh (1935–39) built for the Scottish Office, and the 1939 [...] "Tower of Empire" [...] for the Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938, held in Bellahouston Park.|$|E

500|$|The {{violence}} of the fight clubs serves not to promote or glorify physical combat, but for participants to experience feeling {{in a society where}} they are otherwise numb. The fights tangibly represent a resistance to <b>the</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "cocooned" [...] in society. Norton believed that the fighting between the men strips away the [...] "fear of pain" [...] and [...] "the reliance on material signifiers of their self-worth", leaving them to experience something valuable. When the fights evolve into revolutionary violence, the film only half-accepts the revolutionary dialectic by Tyler Durden; the Narrator pulls back and rejects Durden's ideas. Fight Club purposely shapes an ambiguous message, the interpretation of which is left to the audience. Fincher elaborated, [...] "I love this idea that you can have fascism without offering any direction or solution. Isn't the point of fascism to say, 'This is the way we should be going'? But this movie couldn't be further from offering any kind of solution." ...|$|E
500|$|Written by Philip Martin, {{this story}} was {{submitted}} on 28 December 1983 and dealt with an alien race returning to Earth to discover their [...] "humanity" [...] experiment has failed. The story involved the TARDIS alerting the Doctor {{to the fact that}} a regeneration is in progress nearby, suggesting the presence of a fellow Timelord. The Doctor instead find the elite of the Doomwraiths emerging, reconstituted, as shimmering metal columns with many moving strips and a deadly purpose. The Wraiths find that human evolution has failed, and mankind has not taken on their form; they will thus release a plague to destroy humanity, relocate the missing section of genetic code and repopulate Earth themselves. The Doctor and Peri discover that the Doomwraiths themselves have a genetic flaw which gives them <b>the</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> destroy. The Doctor manages to destroy the discovered code block, but says that the Doomwraiths may have left their legacy on other worlds. On 9 March 1984, Saward noted that the story idea would need further development before he could assess it for commissioning.|$|E
500|$|Focusing on {{the quality}} of the poem, Stuart Sperry, argued in 1973, [...] "'Ode to a Nightingale' is the supreme {{expression}} in all Keats's poetry of <b>the</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>to</b> imaginative escape that flies in the face of the knowledge of human limitation, the impulse fully expressed in 'Away! away! for I will fly to thee.'" [...] Wolf Hirst, in 1981, described the poem as [...] "justly celebrated" [...] and claimed that [...] "Since this movement into an eternal realm of song is one of the most magnificent in literature, the poet's return to actuality is all the more shattering." [...] Helen Vendler continued the earlier view that the poem was artificial but added that the poem was an attempt to be aesthetic and spontaneous that was later dropped. In 1983, she argued, [...] "In its absence of conclusiveness and its abandonment to reverie, the poem appeals to readers who prize it as the most personal, the most apparently spontaneous, the most immediately beautiful, and the most confessional of Keats's odes. I believe that the 'events' of the ode, as it unfolds in time, have more logic, however, than is usually granted them, and that they are best seen in relation to Keats's pursuit of the idea of music as a nonrepresentational art." ...|$|E
