40|$|<b>Tasosartan</b> is a long-acting {{angiotensin}} II (AngII) receptor blocker. Its long {{duration of}} {{action has been}} attributed to its active metabolite enoltasosartan. In this study we evaluated the relative contribution of <b>tasosartan</b> and enoltasosartan to the overall pharmacological effect of <b>tasosartan.</b> AngII receptor blockade effect of single doses of <b>tasosartan</b> (100 mg p. o. and 50 mg i. v) and enoltasosartan (2. 5 mg i. v.) were compared in 12 healthy subjects in a randomized, double blind, three-period crossover study using two approaches: the in vivo blood pressure response to exogenous AngII and an ex vivo AngII radioreceptor assay. <b>Tasosartan</b> induced a rapid and sustained blockade of AngII subtype- 1 (AT 1) receptors. In vivo, <b>tasosartan</b> (p. o. or i. v.) blocked by 80 % AT 1 receptors 1 to 2 h after drug administration and still had a 40 % effect at 32 h. In vitro, the blockade was estimated to be 90 % at 2 h and 20 % at 32 h. In contrast, the blockade induced by enoltasosartan was markedly delayed and hardly reached 60 to 70 % despite the i. v. administration and high plasma levels. In vitro, the AT 1 antagonistic effect of enoltasosartan was markedly influenced by the presence of plasma proteins, leading to a decrease in its affinity for the receptor and a slower receptor association rate. The early effect of <b>tasosartan</b> is due mainly to <b>tasosartan</b> itself with little if any contribution of enoltasosartan. The antagonistic effect of enoltasosartan appears later. The delayed in vivo blockade effect observed for enoltasosartan appears to be due to a high and tight protein binding and a slow dissociation process from the carrier...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{pharmacokinetics}} and pharmacodynamics of angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists (AIIRA), with particular {{focus on the}} novel compound irbesartan. Irbesartan has the highest oral bioavailability in its class (60 % to 80 %) and, unlike valsartan, its absorption is not affected by food. Irbesartan displays linear, dose related pharmacokinetics and, {{with the exception of}} tasosartan's active metabolite, has the longest elimination half-life of the AIIRA (11 to 15 h). Irbesartan exhibits the lowest amount of protein binding, limiting its potential for drug interactions. No drug interactions with irbesartan have been identified. Unlike losartan, candesartan, and <b>tasosartan,</b> irbesartan does not require biotransformation for AII blockade. The pharmacokinetics of irbesartan are not altered in renally or hepatically impaired patients, probably owing to excretion characteristic by both biliary and renal routes, or by differences in gender or age. Within its therapeutic dose range (150 to 300 mg), irbesartan shows sustained, dose related blockade 24 h after dosing. Irbesartan lowers blood pressure in a dose related manner up to 300 mg daily. Some clear differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics exist among the AIIRA, which may have clinical implications.
