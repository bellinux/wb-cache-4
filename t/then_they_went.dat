Not long after, he and other new inductees went to Minter Field in Bakersfield, California for more physical examinations, and <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> north to Visalia for primary training in January23. The class (which had to wear coveralls {{due to the lack of}} standard uniforms) first trained in Ryan PT-22 Recruits before moving back to Minter Field for basic flight training in BT-13 Valiants. Along with his brother Robert, who had also enlisted, Hagerstrom spent about six weeks in basic training. Hagerstrom and his classmates then went to Luke Field near Phoenix, Arizona for advanced flight training in the North American AT-6. On July 26, 1942, he was commissioned a second lieutenant and received his wings from Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, as two new {{teams were}} added to the IPL, the IPL Governing Council {{declared}} that each franchise could retain a maximum of four players of their squad, only three of whom can be Indian players, {{and the rest of the}} international players would be put in the mega-auction. The Chennai franchise, keen to have the same set of core players, retained captain MS Dhoni, vice-captain Suresh Raina, Murali Vijay and all-rounder Albie Morkel for a total of $4.5 million. The retention left them with the power of spending only $4.5 million at the mega-auction. At the auction, they bought back some of their star players of previous seasons such as Hussey, Ashwin, Bollinger and Subramaniam Badrinath. In the 2011 IPL, they lost three of their first five games which placed them at the bottom of the ten-team points table. But <b>then,</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> on to win seven of their next eight games to finish second and register a spot in the knockout stages. They faced the top-ranked team Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Qualifying final which they won by 6 wickets thanks to an unbeaten 73 from Suresh Raina. In the final, they faced the same opponents again, which was held at their home ground Chepauk. Vijay and Hussey put on a 133-run first-wicket partnership that helped the Super Kings to post a total of 205/5. Their bowlers, then, restricted Bangalore to only 147 to take the Super Kings to second consecutive title in the IPL. Vijay was awarded Man of the Match for his match-winning innings of 95. CSK also won all their home games that season becoming the first team in IPL to achieve the feat. However at the Champions League later that year, they won only one out of their four group matches and finished at the bottom.|$|E

25|$|The Super Kings {{won their}} first game against Kings XI Punjab by 33 runs, after scoring 240/5 {{which was the}} highest total of the tournament, a record surpassed by {{themselves}} in 2010 by scoring 246 runs. Chennai also managed to win a close match against Mumbai Indians by 6 runs despite Mumbai batsman Abhishek Nayar scoring an unbeaten 45. <b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> on to beat Kolkata Knight Riders comforatbly by 9 wickets and Royal Challengers Bangalore by 13 runs in their next two games. But their winning run in the tournament took a hit when their overseas stars Matthew Hayden, Michael Hussey and Jacob Oram had to leave for national duties. Their departure immediately affected their performance as they lost their next three games. The batting, although inconsistent, eventually adjusted to the losses of Hayden and Hussey with contributions from Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina and Albie Morkel. In the home game against Delhi Daredevils, CSK were unable to defend a target of 170 due to half-centuries by Delhi openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir. At Jaipur against the home team Rajasthan Royals, the Super Kings batsmen struggled against Pakistani fast-bowler Sohail Tanvir who picked up the best bowling figures in the IPL 2008 (6/14). This was also the best bowling figures in a Twenty20 match until 2011, when Somerset spinner Arul Suppiah took figures of 6 for 5 against Glamorgan. CSK lost another home game to Deccan Chargers which was only the second victory for the latter in the tournament. Chennai beat Delhi Daredevils in their next game by chasing a target of 188, mainly due to the cameos by Vidyut Sivaramakrishnan, Fleming and Morkel. In their next game, Chennai defeated Kings XI Punjab by 18 runs after Subramaniam Badrinath and skipper Dhoni scored half-centuries. The match also witnessed Chennai's Lakshmipathy Balaji claiming the first hat-trick of the tournament {{and in the process}} also getting the first five-for (5/24 in 4 overs) in IPL history. However, they were crushed by the Mumbai Indians in Mumbai as opener Sanath Jayasuriya struck an unbeaten 114 of just 48 balls for the home team, to hand a 9-wicket defeat to the Super Kings. In their eleventh match of the season, they beat the Kolkata Knight Riders by 3 runs (D/L method) in a rain-affected match at the Eden Gardens. In the same match, Makhaya Ntini took the third hat-trick of the tournament and won the Man of the match award for his 4/32 in 4 overs. The Super Kings were unable to chase down a modest total of 127 despite being 60/0 at one stage and suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Royal Challengers Bangalore. In another home game, against Rajasthan Royals, CSK went down by 10 runs chasing 212. Albie Morkel's all-round efforts (2/35 in 4 overs and 71 off 40 balls) went in vain as the Super Kings succumbed to a second straight defeat. In their last league fixture, the Super Kings could easily beat the struggling Deccan Chargers by 7 wickets, with Raina scoring an unbeaten half-century. The Super Kings managed to get a semi-final spot with this win as they finished in third place in the league table with 16 points.|$|E

500|$|Turning this {{argument}} about, the RBIG delivered {{a report to}} McElroy that agreed with the Air Force's original claims on the ineffectiveness of ABMs based on cost. But <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> on to consider the Zeus system itself, and noted that its use of mechanically steered radars, with one radar per missile, meant that Zeus could only launch {{a small number of}} missiles at once. If the Soviets also deployed MRV, even a single ICBM would cause several warheads to arrive at the same time, and Zeus would simply not have time to shoot at them all. They calculated that only four warheads arriving within one minute would result in one of them hitting the Zeus base 90% of the time. Thus one or two Soviet missiles would destroy 100 Zeus's. The RBIG noted that an ABM system [...] "demands such a high rate of fire from an active defense system, in order to intercept the numerous reentry bodies which arrive nearly simultaneously, that the expense of the required equipment may be prohibitive". They went on to question the [...] "ultimate impossibility" [...] of an ABM system.|$|E

However, other Church staff were still encouraged to avoid contact with the inmates: [...] "You didn't talk to them, you looked the other way, you'd leave the area if you saw them, it's like the black plague."
