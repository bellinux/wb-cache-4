40|$|This study {{investigates the}} institutional-legal {{discourse}} of the European Union on food safety. <b>The</b> <b>Summaries</b> of European legislation are investigated {{as a form of}} popularisation stepping from the specialised genre of Directives. In particular, this study develops according to the following steps: providing a contextual framework to the analysis of <b>the</b> <b>Summaries</b> of EU legislation with a view to defining the language of popularisation vs. specialised language; analysing the main features of <b>the</b> EU <b>summary</b> as a genre; exploring the value(s) of modal auxiliaries in <b>the</b> <b>Summaries</b> investigated, specifically shall, in association with forms of citation. The main research questions concern a) the function and value of the modal shall in the citations migrating from the Directives to <b>the</b> <b>Summaries</b> and <b>the</b> consequences of this discursive choice; b) the forms of citation used in <b>the</b> <b>Summaries</b> and modals typically associated with specialised legal discourse, whether they are in line with the function and nature of <b>the</b> <b>Summaries</b> as outlined on <b>the</b> <b>Summaries</b> of EU legislation??? website. The purpose is to investigate the role of power and control {{on the part of the}} EU in addressing a non-specialist audience on such a spiny area as food safety...|$|R

5|$|A second full telling (even {{shorter than}} <b>the</b> <b>summary</b> of Hesiod) is in a Roman-era {{collection}} of myths; {{the account of}} Orion is based largely on the mythologist and poet Pherecydes of Leros. Here Orion is described as earthborn and enormous in stature. This version also mentions Poseidon and Euryale as his parents. It adds a first marriage to Side before his marriage to Merope. All that is known about Side is that Hera threw her into Hades for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a different version of Orion's death than the Iliad: Eos, the Dawn, {{fell in love with}} Orion and took him to Delos where Artemis killed him.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{from the}} Deep convened {{to come up}} with the design for the game, and Hall {{suggested}} a console-style platformer in the vein of Super Mario Bros., as they had the technology made for it; he further recommended a science fiction theme. John Carmack added the idea of a genius child protagonist saving the world, and Hall quickly created a short summary for the game: a dramatic introduction about eight-year-old genius Billy Blaze, defending the Earth with his spaceship. When he read out <b>the</b> <b>summary</b> in an over-dramatic voice to the group, they laughed and applauded, and the group agreed to begin work on Commander Keen in the Invasion of the Vorticons.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} to the automatic creation of extractive summaries of literary short stories. <b>The</b> <b>summaries</b> are produced with a specific objective in mind: to help a reader decide whether she {{would be interested in}} reading the complete story. To this end, <b>the</b> <b>summaries</b> give <b>the</b> user relevant information about the setting of the story without revealing its plot. The system relies on assorted surface indicators about clauses in the short story, the most important of which are those related to the aspectual type of a clause and to the main entities in a story. Fifteen judges evaluated <b>the</b> <b>summaries</b> on a number of extrinsic and intrinsic measures. The outcome of this evaluation suggests that <b>the</b> <b>summaries</b> are helpful in achieving the original objective. 1...|$|R
5|$|In the 1990s, {{a series}} of Historical Public Exposure Studies were {{conducted}} to assess past releases and public exposures. For example, the figure at right illustrates the calculated lifetime cancer risk to a laborer from the 1957 Rocky Flats fire. The key shows the cancer risk due to exposure during the 1957 event per million persons. This figure means that an outdoor laborer in the reddest part of Arvada would have roughly a two-in-a-million risk of contracting cancer (0.000002) from being outside during the 1957 fire. The original, complete figure - {{as well as many}} others showing the risks of past exposures - can be viewed in <b>the</b> <b>Summary</b> of Findings from the Historical Public Exposure Studies.|$|E
5|$|The first sixteen {{issues of}} Unknown had cover paintings, but from July 1940 the cover style {{was changed to}} a table of contents, with a small ink drawing usually {{accompanying}} <b>the</b> <b>summary</b> of each story, {{in an attempt to}} make the magazine appear more dignified. The cover art came almost entirely from artists who did not contribute to many science fiction or fantasy magazines: six of the sixteen paintings were by H. W. Scott; Manuel Islip, Modest Stein, Graves Gladney, and Edd Cartier provided the others. Cartier {{was the only one of}} these who regularly contributed to sf and fantasy periodicals; he painted four of Unknowns last six covers before the change to a text-heavy design.|$|E

In 2011, five former Croatian military personnel were convicted of war crimes for <b>the</b> <b>summary</b> execution of five Bosnian Serb soldiers and an unknown civilian during the offensive.|$|E

5|$|Although Orion has a {{few lines}} in both Homeric poems and in the Works and Days, {{most of the stories}} about him are {{recorded}} in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend. The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly notes in the margins of ancient poets (scholia) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias; even the legend from Hesiod's Astronomy survives only in one such compilation. In several cases, including <b>the</b> <b>summary</b> of the Astronomy, although the surviving work bears the name of a famous scholar, such as Apollodorus of Athens, Eratosthenes, or Gaius Julius Hyginus, what survives is either an ancient forgery or an abridgement of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence; editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on the works of the scholars.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President {{is divided}} into four chapters, the first two of which {{summarize}} the Bible from a New Monastic perspective. <b>The</b> <b>summary</b> of the Old Testament argues that the Israelites had a unique political philosophy, but that they {{failed to live up}} to its implications. The New Testament summary considers Jesus' politics and the qualities of the Christian Church. The third chapter suggests implications of this narrative for citizens of the United States, who the authors describe as members of an empire similar to that of the Romans. This chapter argues that the Book of Revelation has more to do with living faithfully in an evil empire than with eschatology. The chapter also asserts that Constantinianism had generally negative consequences for the Church. The fourth chapter tells of Christians living in countercultural ways that model divine redemption towards others. Other stories involve heterodox economics, defending the homeless, Amish forgiveness, dumpster diving, missional robotics, Martin Luther King Jr., anti-war protests, and The Simple Way.|$|E
5|$|Reports of {{the brutal}} {{policies}} of the organization soon {{made their way to}} Phnom Penh and into the population foretelling the violence that was about to consume the nation. There were tales of the forced relocations of entire villages, of <b>the</b> <b>summary</b> execution of any who disobeyed or even asked questions, the forbidding of religious practices, of monks who were defrocked or murdered, and where traditional sexual and marital habits were foresworn. War was one thing, the offhand manner in which the Khmer Rouge dealt out death, so contrary to the Khmer character, was quite another. Reports of these atrocities began to surface during the same period in which North Vietnamese troops were withdrawing from the Cambodian battlefields. This was no coincidence. The concentration of the PAVN effort on South Vietnam allowed the Khmer Rouge to apply their doctrine and policies without restraint for the first time.|$|E
