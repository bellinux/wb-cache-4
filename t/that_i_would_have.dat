25|$|The {{statement}} “I’m {{a believer}} in social Darwinism,” {{did not come from}} me. In fact, I had to look up the expression to learn what was being referred to. This attack appears to be calling me a Nazi, nothing less. I demand that Mr. Storr refer me to the original sources to which we assume he has referred. Until then, I’ll only say that he has carefully selected phrases and statements out of context, not the sort of referencing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> expected from him.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, I {{was officially}} demanded {{to join the}} National Socialist Party. At this time I was already Technical Director at the Army Rocket Center at Peenemünde (Baltic Sea). The {{technical}} work carried out there had, in the meantime, attracted more and more attention in higher levels. Thus, my refusal to join the party would have meant <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to abandon the work of my life. Therefore, I decided to join. My membership in the party did not involve any political activity.|$|E
25|$|The reason I didn't {{review the}} book is that it perhaps would have taken me three weeks. My {{appreciation}} {{of it is that}} diverse and that complicated... John is perhaps the only contemporary writer who I know now who gives me the sense of the fact that life is—the life that we perform is in an environment that enjoys a grandeur that escapes us. Rabbit is very much possessed of a paradise lost, of a paradise known fleetingly perhaps through erotic love and a paradise that he pursues through his children. It's the vastness of John's scope <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> described if I could through a review.|$|E

500|$|James Cameron said: [...] "I enjoyed Prometheus. I {{thought it}} was great. I {{thought it was}} Ridley {{returning}} to science fiction with gusto, with great tactical performance, beautiful photography, great native 3D.

500|$|In {{a wide-ranging}} {{interview}} with American novelist Bryan Malessa in 1998, LeMond {{was asked if}} his career had not been interrupted by the hunting accident, how did he feel he would compare to five time Tour winners such as Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain. LeMond responded: [...] "Of course you can't rewrite racing history, but I'm confident <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> won five Tours." ...|$|E
500|$|George Bernard Shaw {{sat for a}} {{portrait}} and gave an idea of Rodin's technique: [...] "While he worked, he achieved a number of miracles. At {{the end of the}} first fifteen minutes, after having given a simple idea of the human form to the block of clay, he produced by the action of his thumb a bust so living <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> taken it away with me to relieve the sculptor of any further work." ...|$|E

500|$|Obama raised {{enough money}} to remain {{competitive}} with Rush. However, he neither connected with the working-class African Americans of the district nor provided a convincing reason for them to vote against Rush. Obama later wrote: [...] "Less than halfway into the campaign, I knew in my bones that I was going to lose. Each morning from that point forward I awoke with a vague sense of dread, realizing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{to spend the day}} smiling and shaking hands and pretending that everything was going according to plan." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith {{received}} his first political office in November 1958, following that month's Federal election (in {{which he was}} returned as MP for Gwanda), after one of Welensky's Federal Cabinet ministers requested Smith's appointment as a Parliamentary Secretary in the new United Federal Party (UFP) government. Welensky turned this down, saying that while he appreciated Smith's relative seniority on the back benches after 10 years in parliament, {{he did not think}} he had [...] "shown the particular drive <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> expected" [...] for such a role. He decided to instead give Smith [...] "a run as Chief Whip, which is generally the step to a ministerial appointment, and... see how he works out".|$|E

I will look in your eyes and tell you that I'm not dumb enough or moronic enough to think that you are dumb or moronic enough not to see <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> stolen a melody. If you put the songs next to each other, side by side, the only {{similarities}} are the chord progression. It's the same one that has been in disco music for the last 50 years. Just because I'm the first fucking artist in 25 years to think of putting it on Top 40 radio, it doesn't mean I'm a plagiarist, it means I'm fucking smart. Sorry." ...|$|E

"Faith Won't Fail" [...] was {{inspired}} by faith always sufficing in Bible situations and chapters; and Hudson commented on [...] "Search Me": [...] "I was struggling with the fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> the huge responsibility of how others would be affected through what I was doing or saying on stage. I don't want to put {{on some kind of}} front that everything is good when it's not. I wanted to keep it real, but still give people hope." [...] The record closes with [...] "When There's Nothing Left", which {{has been described as a}} [...] "crisp and clean 'love note' to God". The album was described as not being in the vein of the bubble gum pop variety rather evoking comparisons to the Christian pop songstresses Rachel Lampa and Jaci Velasquez.|$|E
500|$|Gerard George Lowe {{came from}} Johannesburg, South Africa. He was a {{chemical}} engineer with South African Breweries. He went to Singapore {{to shop for}} electrical and electronic goods. Before he left Johannesburg on 7 March 1995, he told his wife Vanessa, a local airlines employee, his exact schedule, saying: [...] "I will call you the moment I check into the hotel {{to give you the}} contact number. If you do not hear from me on 10 March, it would mean <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a seat on the plane to return to South Africa and would arrive home on 11 March. But if I do call you on 10 March, that would mean that I have not managed to get a seat and would return on 12 March." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} directed by Brett Ratner, who had shot Carey's previous two videos. However, Jake Nava {{was used as the}} director instead, as Ratner had other obligations regarding one of his films. It was filmed during the end of June 2005. When describing the video's concept to MTV News, Carey said [...] "I actually just got the treatment. We came up with some cool concepts." [...] When asked for a more detailed synopsis, Carey declined and responded [...] "It's [...] "really technical. It's a new approach <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to let [...] explain. It's new territory." [...] During a scene in the video in which Carey had to wear very high-heeled pumps, she had the video crew carry her to various sections of the set. When Nava suggested she wear a pair of sensible flat footwear in between shoots, Carey jokingly replied [...] "my feet repel them dahling." [...] When recalling the moment in a later interview, Carey claimed her feet were [...] "in agony" [...] and said [...] "My high heels had left my feet bleeding. Laugh all you want, my feet hurt." ...|$|E

500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done it either. I think of all the things that I still want to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] the idea that people assume that he is either gay or straight. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Hayes admitted that people believe he is Jack [...] "24 hours a day".|$|E
500|$|During August and September 1987, Echo & the Bunnymen co-headlined {{a tour of}} the United States {{with popular}} {{electronic}} group New Order. Despite the tour passing without incident, the performances were deemed to be of poor quality. Although American audiences were apparently satisfied by the shows, when the group returned to the United Kingdom for an autumn tour the British music press and audiences were not as equally enthusiastic. Shortly thereafter the band announced plans to record a self-produced album of [...] "savage rock" [...] when there was more free time. The group toured the UK and the US again in early 1988. These concerts were more positively received than their tour the previous year, with guitarist Will Sergeant being singled out for praise– BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel said, [...] "Will Sergeant was superb, moving in a trice from squalls of angry sound to playing with such care and subtlety that there were whispered asides from his guitar <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> sworn only he and I had heard." [...] In March 1988, the band released a cover version of The Doors' song [...] "People Are Strange". However, this failed to impress critics; music paper Melody Maker called it a [...] "rancid effort" [...] and Q said the band had [...] "thrown in the towel".|$|E
500|$|... "The Variable" [...] was the {{hundredth}} {{episode of the}} show to be produced and aired on television. Josh Holloway, who {{plays the role of}} Sawyer, said, [...] "Just statistically speaking, to hit a hundred episodes doesn't happen very often, especially on a show where everyone is saying 'Lost on an island? What are you gonna do after a season or two?', so the fact that we've lasted not only a season or two but flourishing still at this time... it's shocking... it's amazing to me." [...] In an interview with The News & Observer, Lindelof recalled meeting with the ABC executives in 2004 to pitch the idea of a plane crash and survivors stranded on an island full of mystery and danger. When Lindelof was asked by the executives where the Lost saga would stand in the future, he replied, [...] "We're probably not going to get past episode thirteen. Let's all be honest about that up front." [...] Lindelof added that if he had [...] "traveled back in time to tell myself after that meeting {{that we were going to}} make it to a hundred and still have a season beyond <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> laughed in my face." [...] The hundredth episode milestone was celebrated by the cast and crew on location in Oahu, Hawaii. Duff Goldman and his crew from the Food Network's American television show Ace of Cakes made a special Lost cake for the party to commemorate the milestone. The cake featured replicas of a Dharma beer bottles, the computer from the Swan station, a suitcase and a miniature Oceanic Flight 815. The Ace of Cakes episode ("LOST in Hawaii") featuring the making of the cake aired on the Food Network in the United States on May 9, 2009.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{withdrawal}} of Tom Daschle's nomination for the position, Dean had been touted by many for the post of Secretary of Health and Human Services.
