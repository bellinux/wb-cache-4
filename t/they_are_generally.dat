5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{sometimes}} used for obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> believed ineffective for this indication.

5|$|Interesting, perhaps, {{in the use}} {{of weapons}} in these recent “revolutionary” works is that <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> <b>generally</b> speaking, not reenactments of {{traditional}} folk dances. The introduction of weaponry into Chinese ballet—regardless of the revolutionary message—was, itself, a revolution.|$|E

5|$|Emus are diurnal {{birds and}} spend their day foraging, {{preening}} their plumage with their beak, dust bathing and resting. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> gregarious birds {{apart from the}} breeding season, and while some forage, others remain vigilant to their mutual benefit. They are able to swim when necessary, although they rarely do so unless the area is flooded or they need to cross a river.|$|E

5|$|The Cracidae {{are large}} birds, similar in general {{appearance}} to turkeys.

5|$|Trained {{cockatoos}} {{are sometimes}} seen in bird shows in zoos. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> less motivated by food than other birds; some may more respond to petting or praise than food.

5|$|Additionally, {{the actual}} piano sheet music {{from each of}} the ten Final Fantasy Piano Collections albums has been {{published}} as ten corresponding music books by Yamaha Music Media. Each book contains the original music, exactly as arranged and performed on the albums. Unlike the Original Score arrangements, these pieces are intended only for advanced players as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> more difficult. Sheet music for the Final Fantasy XI Piano Collections album included in the Final Fantasy XI OST Premium Box Set was included in that box set, and, like the album itself, is unavailable for purchase elsewhere; sheet music for the identically named standalone piano album is published by Yamaha.|$|E

5|$|Autocannons have an {{automatic}} firing mode, {{similar to that}} of a machine gun. They have mechanisms to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a higher rate of fire than artillery, often approaching, or, in the case of rotary autocannons, even surpassing the firing rate of a machine gun. While there is no minimum bore for autocannons, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> larger than machine guns, typically 20mm or greater since World War II and are usually capable of using explosive ammunition even if it isn't always used. Machine guns in contrast are usually too small to use explosive ammunition.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} few decades, these paper targets have been {{gradually}} replaced by electronic target systems, immediately displaying the results on monitors. When using these systems, actual scoring lines are not printed, but {{the location of the}} impact hole (which can be determined acoustically) is automatically converted into corresponding scores by a computer. ISSF rules now require the use of these systems in top-level competitions. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> used in other international competitions as well, and in some countries they are even common in national competitions.|$|E
5|$|Exsudoporus frostii {{mushrooms}} can {{be recognized}} by their dark red sticky caps, the red pores, the network-like pattern of the stipe, and the bluing reaction to tissue injury. Another characteristic of young, moist fruit bodies is the amber-colored drops exuded on the pore surface. Although the mushrooms are considered edible, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> not recommended for consumption {{because of the risk}} of confusion with other poisonous red-pored, blue-bruising boletes. E.frostii may be distinguished from other superficially similar red-capped boletes by differences in distribution, associated tree species, bluing reaction, or morphology.|$|E
