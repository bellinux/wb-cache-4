5|$|Dinitrogen {{is able to}} {{coordinate}} to metals in five different ways. The more well-characterised ways are the end-on M←N≡N (η1) and M←N≡N→M (μ, bis-η1), in which the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms are donated to the metal cation. The less well-characterised ways involve dinitrogen donating electron pairs from the <b>triple</b> <b>bond,</b> either as a bridging ligand to two metal cations (μ, bis-η2) or to just one (η2). The fifth and unique method involves triple-coordination as a bridging ligand, donating all three electron pairs from the <b>triple</b> <b>bond</b> (μ3-N2). A few complexes feature multiple N2 ligands and some feature N2 bonded in multiple ways. Since N2 is isoelectronic with carbon monoxide (CO) and acetylene (C2H2), the bonding in dinitrogen complexes is closely allied to that in carbonyl compounds, although N2 is a weaker σ-donor and π-acceptor than CO. Theoretical studies show that σ donation is a more important factor allowing {{the formation of the}} M–N bond than π back-donation, which mostly only weakens the N–N bond, and end-on (η1) donation is more readily accomplished than side-on (η2) donation.|$|E
5|$|Many industrially {{important}} compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong <b>triple</b> <b>bond</b> in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), {{the second}} strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, {{but at the}} same time means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the great}} {{reactivity}} of atomic nitrogen, elemental nitrogen usually occurs as molecular N2, dinitrogen. This molecule is a colourless, odourless, and tasteless diamagnetic gas at standard conditions: it melts at −210°C and boils at −196°C. Dinitrogen is mostly unreactive at room temperature, {{but it will}} nevertheless react with lithium metal and some transition metal complexes. This is due to its bonding, which is unique among the diatomic elements at standard conditions in that it has an N≡N <b>triple</b> <b>bond.</b> Triple bonds have short bond lengths (in this case, 109.76pm) and high dissociation energies (in this case, 945.41kJ/mol), and are thus very strong, explaining dinitrogen's chemical inertness.|$|E
50|$|Two atoms can be bonded {{by sharing}} {{more than one}} pair of electrons. The common bonds to carbon are single, double and <b>triple</b> <b>bonds.</b> Single bonds are most common and are {{represented}} by a single, solid line between two atoms in a skeletal formula. Double bonds are denoted by two parallel lines, and <b>triple</b> <b>bonds</b> are shown by three parallel lines.|$|R
40|$|We study alpha, beta, and gamma graphyne, a {{class of}} {{graphene}} allotropes with carbon <b>triple</b> <b>bonds,</b> using a first-principles density-functional method and tight-binding calculation. We find that graphyne has versatile Dirac cones and it is due to remarkable roles of the carbon <b>triple</b> <b>bonds</b> in electronic and atomic structures. The carbon <b>triple</b> <b>bonds</b> modulate effective hopping matrix elements and reverse their signs, resulting in Dirac cones with reversed chirality in alpha graphyne, momentum shift of the Dirac point in beta graphyne, and switch of the energy gap in gamma graphyne. Furthermore, the <b>triple</b> <b>bonds</b> provide chemisorption sites of adatoms which can break sublattice symmetry while preserving planar sp 2 -bonding networks. These features of graphyne open new possibilities for electronic applications of carbon-based two-dimensional materials and derived nanostructures. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R

5|$|Hydrogen, {{like some}} of the alkali metals, reacts explosively with fluorine. Carbon, as lamp black, reacts at room {{temperature}} to yield fluoromethane. Graphite combines with fluorine above 400°C (750°F) to produce non-stoichiometric carbon monofluoride; higher temperatures generate gaseous fluorocarbons, sometimes with explosions. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide react at or just above room temperature, whereas paraffins and other organic chemicals generate strong reactions: even fully substituted haloalkanes such as carbon tetrachloride, normally incombustible, may explode. Although nitrogen trifluoride is stable, nitrogen requires an electric discharge at elevated temperatures for reaction with fluorine to occur, due to the very strong <b>triple</b> <b>bond</b> in elemental nitrogen; ammonia may react explosively. Oxygen does not combine with fluorine under ambient conditions, but can be made to react using electric discharge at low temperatures and pressures; the products tend to disintegrate into their constituent elements when heated. Heavier halogens react readily with fluorine as does the noble gas radon; of the other noble gases, only xenon and krypton react, and only under special conditions.|$|E
25|$|As an alkyne, {{acetylene}} is unsaturated {{because its}} two carbon atoms are bonded {{together in a}} <b>triple</b> <b>bond.</b> The carbon–carbon <b>triple</b> <b>bond</b> places all four atoms in the same straight line, with CCH bond angles of 180°.|$|E
25|$|Retention time {{increases}} with hydrophobic (non-polar) surface area. Branched chain compounds elute {{more rapidly than}} their corresponding linear isomers because the overall surface area is decreased. Similarly organic compounds with single C–C bonds elute later than those with a C=C or C–C <b>triple</b> <b>bond,</b> as the double or <b>triple</b> <b>bond</b> is shorter than a single C–C bond.|$|E
50|$|The {{degree of}} {{unsaturation}} (also {{known as the}} index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) or rings plus double bonds) formula is used in organic chemistry to help draw chemical structures. The formula lets the user determine how many rings, double <b>bonds,</b> and <b>triple</b> <b>bonds</b> {{are present in the}} compound to be drawn. It does not give the exact number of rings or double or <b>triple</b> <b>bonds,</b> but rather the sum of the number of rings and double bonds plus twice the number of <b>triple</b> <b>bonds.</b> The final structure is verified with use of NMR, mass spectrometry and IR spectroscopy, as well as qualitative inspection.|$|R

25|$|In {{systematic}} chemical nomenclature, alkynes {{are named}} with the Greek prefix system without any additional letters. Examples include ethyne or octyne. In parent chains with {{four or more}} carbons, {{it is necessary to}} say where the <b>triple</b> <b>bond</b> is located. For octyne, one can either write 3-octyne or oct-3-yne when the bond starts at the third carbon. The lowest number possible is given to the <b>triple</b> <b>bond.</b> When no superior functional groups are present, the parent chain must include the <b>triple</b> <b>bond</b> even if it is not the longest possible carbon chain in the molecule. Ethyne is commonly called by its trivial name acetylene.|$|E
25|$|In organic chemistry, an alkyne is an {{unsaturated}} hydrocarbon containing {{at least one}} carbon—carbon <b>triple</b> <b>bond.</b> The simplest acyclic alkynes with only one <b>triple</b> <b>bond</b> and no other functional groups form a homologous series with the general chemical formula n2n−2. Alkynes are traditionally known as acetylenes, although the name acetylene also refers specifically to C2H2, known formally as ethyne using IUPAC nomenclature. Like other hydrocarbons, alkynes are generally hydrophobic but {{tend to be more}} reactive.|$|E

25|$|Alkyne protons by {{contrast}} resonate at high field in a 2–3ppm range.

5000|$|The suffix follows IUPAC nomenclature, and {{is mainly}} used in organic chemistry.

25|$|The <b>triple</b> <b>bond</b> is {{very strong}} with a bond {{strength}} of 839 kJ/mol. The sigma bond contributes 369kJ/mol, the first pi bond contributes 268kJ/mol and the second pi-bond of 202kJ/mol bond strength. Bonding usually discussed {{in the context of}} molecular orbital theory, which recognizes the <b>triple</b> <b>bond</b> as arising from overlap of s and p orbitals. In the language of valence bond theory, the carbon atoms in an alkyne bond are sp hybridized: they each have two unhybridized p orbitals and two sp hybrid orbitals. Overlap of an sp orbital from each atom forms one sp–sp sigma bond. Each p orbital on one atom overlaps one on the other atom, forming two pi bonds, giving a total of three bonds. The remaining sp orbital on each atom can form a sigma bond to another atom, for example to hydrogen atoms in the parent acetylene. The two sp orbitals project {{on opposite sides of the}} carbon atom.|$|E
