[...] When people ask how they can help the skeptical movement, Gerbic is quick to suggest that they, too, learn to edit Wikipedia: [...] "We rewrite Wikipedia, and proof the pages, we remove citations that are not noteworthy, we add citations, we do just about everything in Wikipedia to improve content."

2500|$|As a [...] "wheeler-dealer", Mickey bonded {{particularly}} well with another dodgy dealer on the Square, Mo Harris (Laila Morse). Swash has commented, [...] "It's natural for Mickey and Mo {{to be close}} because they're so similar. They're into the same things and doing business." [...] Their interaction was mostly used for comedic purposes. In 2004, the duo were featured in a special plot to highlight the BBC's fundraising event, Sport Relief, which tackles poverty and disadvantage, both in the UK and internationally. On-screen, Mickey competed in the Fitness First Sport Relief Mile, to raise money via sponsoring.

2500|$|Bob Minton, at {{the time}} a {{prominent}} critic of Scientology, received the first award in 2000 as the Alternative Charlemagne Award. [...] In her speech at the event, Scientology Task Force of the Hamburg Interior Authority Commissioner Ursula Caberta cited Minton's recognition of [...] "what dangers could arise for people and liberal democracy from Scientology." [...] Minton had provided former members of Scientology with financial and legal assistance after they had left the organization. [...] At the awards ceremony, Sect Commissioner of the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg Thomas Gandow stated [...] "By holding this ceremony, we intended to give a sign that, in spite of the Clinton administration, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> America who think differently and who do not swim with the Scientology tide." [...] Gandow cited Minton's actions as chairman of the Lisa McPherson Trust helping former members of Scientology make claims against the organization in court. [...] The Church of Scientology was critical of Minton being honored, and formed its own organization opposed to the Leipzig Human Rights Award, and on May 29, 2000 sent letters to bishops of the Evangelical State Churches in Berlin-Brandenburg and Saxony. [...] The letter stated that Sect Commissioner Thomas Gandow should be dismissed, and said that the Saxon state church should [...] "distance itself from the [...] procedure." [...] In response, Gandow stated that Clinton had received the Charlemagne Award despite his affair with Monica Lewinsky. [...] The awards ceremony took place at the old stock exchange in the Old City of Leipzig. [...] The award given to Minton was presented as a sculpture of the St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig, and was created by Leipzig artist Ruediger Bartels. [...] The award presentation was held on June 3, 2000, one day after the presentation of the official Charlemagne Award to President Bill Clinton by Aachen Mayor Jürgen Linden.|$|E
