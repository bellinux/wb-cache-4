40|$|The {{arginine}} vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) hormone pathways {{are involved in}} a multitude of physiological processes, and their receptor genes (AVPR 1 A and OXTR) have been implicated in increased partner preference and pair bonding behavior in mammalian lineages. This observation is of considerable importance for understanding social monogamy in primates, which is present in only a small subset of primate taxa, including Azara 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>owl</b> monkeys (Aotus azarai). Thus, it is the goal of this dissertation to examine the molecular evolution of AVPR 1 A and OXTR in owl monkeys to better understand how the pro-social behaviors related to those loci may have evolved. ^ However, in order to properly contextualize functional neurogenetic variation related to such sociobehavioral patterns, it is necessary to first establish the range of molecular variation occurring at non-related genetic loci. To address this issue, we sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome of two species of Aotus (A. azarai and A. nancymaae), and analyzed 39 haplotypes of the mitochondrial COII gene from ten different owl monkey taxa. Next, to understand the recent evolutionary history and genetic structure of our focal owl monkey population, we assessed variation of the mtDNA control region (D-loop) in 118 wild individuals. Furthermore, to establish our knowledge of genetic kinship and individual identity within the wild population, we investigated autosomal variation in the form of 24 short tandem repeat (STR) microsatellite loci. ^ In concert with these analyses, we characterized the molecular features of AVPR 1 A and OXTR in A. azarai and other platyrrhines through direct sequencing, and demonstrated that there are substantial sequence differences at both loci across primate species. These data provide new clues on the possible basis of pair bonding in New World species, and may help to explain the sporadic appearance of monogamy in this infraorder. Specifically, despite a common molecular origin, we argue that the AVP and OT pathways have evolved in markedly different ways, due in part to their chromosomal locations and their relative proximity to regions of molecular instability. This study reinforces the notion that neurogenetic loci in primates have undergone significant evolutionary changes, and suggests that monogamy has arisen multiple times in the primate order through different molecular mechanisms. ...|$|R
40|$|Grid {{environment}} is a service oriented infrastructure {{in which many}} heterogeneous resources participate to provide the high performance computation. One of the bug issues in the grid {{environment is}} the vagueness and uncertainty between advertised resources and requested resources. Furthermore, in an environment such as grid dynamicity is considered as a crucial issue which must be dealt with. Classical rough set {{have been used to}} deal with the uncertainty and vagueness. But it can just be used on the static systems and can not support dynamicity in a system. In this work we propose a solution, called Dynamic Rough Set Resource Discovery (DRSRD), for dealing with cases of vagueness and uncertainty problems based on Dynamic rough set theory which considers dynamic features in this environment. In this way, requested resource properties have a weight as priority according to which resource matchmaking and ranking process is done. We also report the result of the solution obtained from the simulation in GridSim simulator. The comparison has been made between DRSRD, classical rough set theory based algorithm, and UDDI and <b>OWL</b> <b>S</b> combined algorithm.

40|$|Hundreds {{of species}} of wild-caught birds are {{offered for sale}} in the bird markets of Java and Bali, Indonesia, to meet the demand for the largely-domestic pet and {{songbird}} trade. In the past, owls were offered only in very small numbers in these bird markets but since the release of the Harry Potter series in Indonesia in the early 2000 s their popularity as pets has increased. Whereas in the past owls were collective known as Burung Hantu (“Ghost birds”), in the bird markets they are now commonly referred to as Burung Harry Potter (“Harry Potter birds”). We made a retrospective quantitative assessment of the abundance of owls in the bird markets (1979 – 2010) and conducted 109 surveys in 20 bird markets in 2012 – 2016 to quantify owls in trade. In the 1980 s, 1990 s and early 2000 <b>s</b> <b>owls</b> were rarely recorded in Indonesia's bird markets, typically one or two and up to five per survey, and frequently no owls were recorded at all. The trade was largely confined to small scops owls. In the late 2000 s more species were offered for sale, including barn and bay owls, and larger owl species such as wood-owls, eagle-owls and fish-owls; typically 10  + owls were observed per survey. In recent years, the number of owl species increased even more, and on average we recorded 17 owls per survey, yielding a total of 1810 owls, and in > 90 % of the surveys owls were present. In the larger bird markets in Jakarta and Bandung typically 30 to 60 owls are on offer of up to 8 species at a time. The number of owls as a proportion of all birds in the markets increased from 0. 43 % post 2008, suggesting a delayed Harry Potter effect. Over this period, common species have become cheaper and less common ones have become more expensive. The owls are largely, if not exclusively, wild-caught and are sold into the domestic pet market. The release of Harry Potter films and novels in Indonesia coincided with the rise of the Internet and social media and, with some delay, the emergence of pet owl interest groups on Java and Bali, thus preventing us to demonstrate a causal Harry Potter effect on the owl trade. The overall popularity of owls as pets in Indonesia has risen {{to such an extent that}} it may imperil the conservation of some of the less abundant species. Inclusion of owls on Indonesia's protected species list, alongside all diurnal raptors, may be a first step to mitigate the negative effects of this emerging trend...|$|R
40|$|Hierarchical genetic {{structure}} was {{examined in the}} three geographically-defined subspecies of spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) to define relationships among subspecies and quantify variation within and among regional and local populations. Sequences (522 bp) from domains I and II of the mitochondrial control region were analyzed for 213 individuals from 30 local breeding areas. Results confirmed significant differences between northern spotted owls and the other traditional geographically defined subspecies but did not provide support for subspecific level differences between California and Mexican spotted owls. Divergence times among subspecies estimated with a 936 bp portion of the cytochrome b gene dated Northern and California/Mexican spotted owl divergence time to 115, 000 – 125, 000 years ago, whereas California/Mexican spotted owl divergence was estimated at 15, 000 years ago. Nested clade analyses indicated an association between California spotted owl and Mexican spotted owl haplotypes, implying historical contact between the two groups. Results also {{identified a number of}} individuals geographically classified as northern spotted <b>owls</b> (<b>S.</b> o. caurina) that contained haplotypes identified as California spotted <b>owls</b> (<b>S.</b> o. occidentalis). Among all northern spotted owls sampled (n = 131), 12. 9 % contained California spotted owl haplotypes. In the Klamath region, which is the contact zone between the two subspecies, 20. 3 % (n = 59) of owls were classified as California spotted owls. The Klamath region is a zone of hybridization and speciation for many other taxa as well. Analyses of population structure indicated gene flow among regions within geographically defined subspecies although there was significant differentiation among northern and southern regions of Mexican spotted owls. Among all areas examined, genetic diversity was not significantly reduced except in California spotted owls where the southern region consists of one haplotype. Our results indicate a stable contact zone between northern and California spotted owls, maintaining distinct subspecific haplotypes within their traditional ranges. This supports recovery efforts based on the traditional subspecies designation for the northern spotted owl. Further, although little variation was found between California and Mexican spotted owls, we suggest they should be managed separately because of current isolation between groups...|$|R

5000|$|Barred owls {{are partly}} {{responsible}} for the recent decline of the northern spotted owl, native to British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. The 2011 Revised Recovery Plan for the Northern Spotted Owl (p. vi) states “Based on the best available scientific information, competition from the barred <b>owl</b> (<b>S.</b> varia) poses a significant and complex threat to the spotted owl.” Since the 1960s, barred owls have been expanding their range westward from the eastern US and Canada (see “Distribution and habitat” section above). When spotted owls and barred owls share the same area, the barred owls generally are more aggressive and out-compete the spotted owls, leading to decreased populations of the native owls. Barred owls may even kill spotted owls. Barred owls and spotted owls occasionally interbreed, creating hybrids ("sparred owl" [...] or [...] "botted owl"). Only 47 hybrids with barred owls were found in an analysis of more than 9000 banded spotted owls; consequently, hybridization between these two species is considered by the authors of that analysis to be “an interesting biological phenomenon that is probably inconsequential compared with the real threat—direct competition between the two species for food and space” (p. 808).|$|R
40|$|Eight {{subspecies}} {{have been}} proposed within the Tawny Owl (Strix aluco) species. However, recent molecular data have challenged this view, encouraging further work in this species complex. Here we reevaluated the taxonomic status between the North-Western African Tawny <b>Owl,</b> <b>S.</b> a. mauritanica, and its closest Iberian Tawny Owl population (from the S. a. sylvatica to S. a. aluco clade) separated by the Strait of Gibraltar. The Tawny Owl is a non-migratory and territorial species, and juvenile dispersal is restricted to a few kilometers around the natal site. This limited dispersal and the barrier imposed by the Strait of Gibraltar predicted a strong differentiation between the two populations. We tested this using DNA barcoding, Bayesian phylogenetic and species delimitation analysis. We found that an 81. 1 % of variation {{is due to the}} intergroups variation. In addition, the inter-intraspecific distances distribution revealed a barcoding gap among the two subspecies. Also, posterior probabilities and the PAB value allowed to reject the hypothesis that observed degree of distinctiveness is due to random coalescence processes. These findings clearly support the Strait of Gibraltar as an isolating barrier for this species. The subspecific status is confirmed and species status is even suggested for S. a. mauritanica.

An unaddressed threat is whether Barred Owls could {{be a source of}} novel strains of disease such as avian malaria (Plasmodium spp.) or other blood parasites potentially harmful for Spotted Owls. Although Barred Owls commonly harbor Plasmodium infections, these parasites have not been documented in the Spotted Owl. We screened 111 Spotted Owls, 44 Barred Owls, and 387 owls of nine other species for haemosporidian parasites (Leucocytozoon, Plasmodium, and Haemoproteus spp.). California Spotted Owls had the greatest number of simultaneous multi-species infections (44 %). Additionally, sequencing results revealed that the Northern and California Spotted Owl subspecies together had the highest number of Leucocytozoon parasite lineages (n = 17) and unique lineages (n = 12). This high level of sequence diversity is significant because only one Leucocytozoon species (L. danilewskyi) has been accepted as valid among all owls, suggesting that L. danilewskyi is a cryptic species. Furthermore, a Plasmodium parasite was documented in a Northern Spotted Owl for the first time. West Coast Barred Owls had a lowe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAvian trichomonosis, {{caused by}} the flagellated {{protozoan}} parasite Trichomonas gallinae, has variable pathogenicity among bird species ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe disease periodically manifesting in epidemic mortality. Traditionally, columbids are identified as highly susceptible to infection with occasional spillover into raptors that prey on infected birds. We identified avian trichomonosis in two dead California spotted owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) and three dead northern spotted <b>owls</b> (<b>S.</b>  o. caurina) in California during 2011 – 2015; infection was confirmed in four owls by PCR. Pathologic lesions associated with trichomonosis in the owls included caseonecrotic lesions of the upper palate accompanied by oropharyngitis, cellulitis, myositis, and/or sinusitis. Spotted owls are known to mainly feed on small mammals; therefore, the source of infection {{as well as the}} significance of the disease in spotted owls is unclear. These owl trichomonosis cases coincided temporally and spatially with three trichomonosis epidemics in band-tailed pigeons (Patagioenas fasciata monilis). The same parasite, T.  gallinae subtype A 2, was isolated from the spotted owls and band-tailed pigeons, suggesting the owls became infected when opportunistically feeding on pigeons during mortality events. Avian trichomonosis {{is an important factor in}} the decline of the Pacific Coast band-tailed pigeon population with near-annual mortality events during the last 10 years and could have conservation implications for raptor species at risk, particularly those that are facing multiple threats...|$|R
40|$|Understanding how {{survival}} {{is affected by}} the environment is essential to gain insight into population dynamics and the evolution of life-history traits as well as to identify environmental selection pressures. However, we still have little understanding of the relative effect of different environmental factors and their interactions on demographic traits and population dynamics. Here we used two long-term, individual-based datasets on Tawny Owl Strix aluco (1981 - 2010) and Ural <b>Owl</b> <b>S.</b> uralensis (1986 - 2010) to undertake capture-mark-recapture analysis of annual survival of adult females in response to three biologically meaningful environmental variables and their two-way interactions. Despite the similar ecology of these two species, their survival was associated with different and uncorrelated environmental drivers. The main correlate of Tawny Owl survival was an inverse association with snow depth (winter severity). For Ural Owl, high food (vole) abundance improved survival during years with deep snow, but was less important during years with little snow. In addition, Ural Owl survival was strongly density-dependent, whereas Tawny Owl survival was not. Our findings advise caution in extrapolating demographic inferences from one species to another, even when they are very closely related and ecologically similar. Analyses including only one or few potential environmental drivers of a species' survival may lead to incomplete conclusions because survival may be affected by several factors and their interactions...|$|R
40|$|The Powerful Owl (Ninox strenua) is Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> largest <b>owl.</b> Considering {{their large}} size {{they are a}} very cryptic species, with limited sexual dimorphism, silent fight and a highly camouflaged {{presence}} amongst secluded canopy vegetation. These features enable Powerful Owl presence to often go unnoticed and even for the trained eye, extremely difficult to study. Our {{research has focused on}} monitoring the behaviour of individual Powerful Owls in urban Melbourne, Australia. The leg banding of Powerful Owls is a somewhat contentious issue in Australia and here we report on the suitability of different types of legs bands placed on the tarsus of juvenile Powerful Owls. There has been some debate over the band size that should be used and the consequent effects bands may pose for the owls as they mature. We also investigate the usefulness of bands as a technique to identify Powerful Owls once they have dispersed from the natal territory. Radio-tracking juvenile Powerful Owls was also undertaken during this study, primarily to determine individual behaviour from post fledging until dispersal. This is the first study in Australia to attempt radio-tracking juvenile Powerful Owls and the results from this research highlight behavioural characteristics, mortality rates post fledging and dispersal movements for the twelve months post fledging. Overall we found that aluminium legs bands are a useful tool for individual identification of juvenile Powerful Owls post fledgling, however, their presence is somewhat difficult to determine on mature adults as the tarsus feathers tend to cover the band and make vision from the ground difficult. Aluminium leg bands are also useful as an identification tool for deceased birds. Leather leg bands are more suitable than aluminium bands when attaching radio-transmitters as these provide more flexibility and can be removed by the owl if they become irritating. Radio-tracking juvenile Powerful Owls provided invaluable information relating to juvenile behaviour and movements, showing that juveniles actually remain in territories adjacent to their natal territory for the twelve months post fledging. This information is vital for the successful conservation of this species, particularly in relation to habitat conservation and home-range modelling. <br /...|$|R
40|$|We report {{here the}} {{successful}} {{assembly of the}} complete mitochondrial genomes of the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) and the barred <b>owl</b> (<b>S.</b> varia). We utilized sequence data from two sequencing methodologies, Illumina paired-end sequence data with insert lengths ranging from approximately 250 nucleotides (nt) to 9, 600 nt and read lengths from 100 – 375 nt and Sanger-derived sequences. We employed multiple assemblers and alignment methods to generate the final assemblies. The circular genomes of S. o. caurina and S. varia are comprised of 19, 948 nt and 18, 975 nt, respectively. Both code for two rRNAs, twenty-two tRNAs, and thirteen polypeptides. They both have duplicated control region sequences with complex repeat structures. We {{were not able to}} assemble the control regions solely using Illumina paired-end sequence data. By fully spanning the control regions, Sanger-derived sequences enabled accurate and complete assembly of these mitochondrial genomes. These are the first complete mitochondrial genome sequences of owls (Aves: Strigiformes) possessing duplicated control regions. We searched the nuclear genome of S. o. caurina for copies of mitochondrial genes and found at least nine separate stretches of nuclear copies of gene sequences originating in the mitochondrial genome (Numts). The Numts ranged from 226 – 19, 522 nt in length and included copies of all mitochondrial genes except tRNAPro, ND 6, and tRNAGlu. Strix occidentalis caurina and S. varia exhibited an average of 10. 74 % (8. 68 % uncorrected p-distance) divergence across the non-tRNA mitochondrial genes...|$|R
40|$|Although {{research}} on spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) {{has increased dramatically}} in the last decade, factors influencing owl reproduction still are poorly known. This ongoing study uses 9 years of demographic data to analyze associations between owl reproduction and weather, cone crop abundance, and nest-site structure. Initial results indicate no correlation between cone crop abundance and owl reproduction, but significant associations between owl reproductive success and spring weather conditions and nestsite structure. The management of many western forests has been directly influenced by legal and biological requirements for maintaining viable populations of the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). Although most of the controversy has focused on protecting the old-growth habitat associated with the owl, the long-term viability of the species will also depend on its reproductive success. It {{has been difficult to}} assess owl population trends because owls disperse over large areas, and demographic studies rarely have a closed population in which a thorough, longterm census has been done. In the absence of better demographic data, identifying factors that may influence reproduction can be an important tool for inferring population response to changing environmental conditions. Several studies of the spotted owl have inferred that habitat quality, prey abundance, and weather are likely influences on reproduction (Franklin and others 2000, Thomas and others 1990, Zabel and others 1996). Reproduction by the northern spotted <b>owl</b> (<b>S.</b> occidentalis caurina) may be negatively correlated with current winter precipitation (Wagner and others 1996, Zabel et al 1996). I...|$|R

It is at this point of the text that Coulter draws a parallel between the narrator 2 ̆ 7 s distress and Sadegh Hedayat 2 ̆ 7 s personal angst, both of which stem from an inability to reconcile Western and Eastern influences and modes of existence and culture. Moreover, the narrator 2 ̆ 7 s inability to completely accept or disregard the notion of metaphysics is a macrocosmic manifestation of his cultural dilemma. Coulter concludes her argumentation with a discussion of how one of perhaps the most important fault lines of post-colonial discourse is very real in present-day Iran, precisely because Iranians still do not agree on how to reclaim their cultural past and assert their own identity in the real context of Western cultural omnipresence...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{population}} {{expansion of}} Barred Owls (Strix varia) into western North America {{has led to}} concern that they may compete with and further harm the Northern Spotted <b>Owl</b> (<b>S.</b> occidentalis caurina), which is already listed as threatened under the U. S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Because they hybridize, there is a legal need under the ESA for forensic identification of both species and their hybrids. We used mitochondrial control-region DNA and amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses to assess maternal and biparental gene flow in this hybridization process. Mitochondrial DNA sequences (524 base pairs) indicated large divergence between Barred and Spotted Owls (13. 9 %). Further, the species formed two distinct clades with no signs of previous introgression. Fourteen diagnostic AFLP bands also indicated extensive divergence between the species, including markers differentiating them. Principal coordinate analyses and assignment tests clearly supported this differentiation. We found that hybrids had unique genetic combinations, including AFLP markers from both parental species, and identified known hybrids as well as potential hybrids with unclear taxonomic status. Our analyses corroborated the findings of extensive field studies that most hybrids genetically sampled resulted from crosses between female Barred Owls and male Spotted Owls. These genetic markers {{make it possible to}} clearly identify these species as well as hybrids and can now be used for research, conservation, and law enforcement. Several legal avenues may facilitate future conservation of Spotted Owls and other ESA-listed species that hybridize, including the ESA similarity-of-appearance clause (section 4 [e]) and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act appears to be the most useful route at this time...|$|R
40|$|The {{range of}} the barred owl (Strix varia) has {{expanded}} westward {{over the past century}} and now entirely overlaps the {{range of the}} federally threatened northern spotted <b>owl</b> (<b>S.</b> occidentalis caurina) in the Pacific Northwest. We compared Haemoproteus blood parasite assemblages among northern spotted owls in their native range and barred owls in both their native and invasive ranges to evaluate predictions of five hypotheses about parasites and biological invasions: (1) Enemy Release, where hosts benefit from a loss of parasites in their invasive range, (2) Enemy of My Enemy, where invasive hosts introduce parasites to naı¨ve native hosts, (3) Parasite Spillback, where invasive hosts act as a new reservoir to native parasites, (4) Increased Susceptibility, where native hosts introduce parasites to naı¨ve invasive hosts, and (5) Dilution Effect, where invasive species act as poor hosts to native parasites and decrease the density of potential hosts in their invasive range. We used haplotype network analyses to identify one haplotype common to both owl species throughout North America, three more haplotypes that appeared to be isolated to the barred owl’s historic range, and a fifth haplotype that was only found in California. Based on infection status and parasite diversity in eastern and western barred owl populations, we found strong support for the Enemy Release Hypothesis. Northern spotted owls had higher parasite diversity and probability of infection than sympatric barred owls, offering some support for the Parasite Spillback and Dilution Effect Hypotheses. Overall, this study demonstrates the complexity of host-parasite relationships and highlights some {{of the ways in which}} species’ range expansions may alter such relationships among both invasive and native hosts...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Wildlife, 1998 Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis) appear heat intolerant. One of the {{hypotheses}} {{to explain the}} close association of Spotted Owls with old-growth coniferous forests is that the multilayered and complex structure of these forests provides a cooler microclimate for roosting owls than early seral-stage forests. Therefore, I compared temperatures at summer roosts of 22 Northern Spotted <b>Owls</b> (<b>S.</b> o. caurina) with temperatures at random sites within stands where owls roosted and at random sites within adjacent younger forests on the Willow Creek Study Area (WCSA) {{in the interior of}} northwestern California. Temperatures at actual roost sites within mature/old-growth forests were significantly lower than those at random sites within adjacent younger stands. Temperatures at random sites within owl roost stands were intermediate between roost site temperatures and those at random sites within younger forests. Spotted Owls selected cooler microclimates each time they changed their roost when ambient temperatures were above their upper critical temperature of 25. 2 ??C. In an effort to explain the use of second-growth forests by Spotted Owls in the coastal redwood zone of northwestern California, I also examined temperature differences and temperature profiles between microsites in mature/old-growth and younger forests at both WCSA and Redwood National Park (RNP). Forests, including mature/old-growth and younger forests, at RNP were much cooler than those at WCSA. Due to the marine influence on summer climate, there was little variation in temperature profiles between mature/old-growth and younger forests at RNP. In addition, mature/old-growth forests at WCSA had a cooler microclimate and a less variable temperature profile than younger forests at WCSA. My study demonstrated microclimate selection in Spotted Owls, and the importance of multilayered stand structure in creating cool microclimates and stable thermal environments from the forest floor to canopy level. Finally, in comparison with the interior, the much cooler summer climate at the coast may account for the relaxed Spotted Owl roost selection in early successional stage forests...|$|R

The article is copyrighted by the Wildlife Society and published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. It can be found at: [URL] federally threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is the focus of intensive conservation efforts that have led to much forested land being reserved as habitat for the owl and associated wildlife species throughout the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Recently, however, a relatively new threat to spotted owls has emerged {{in the form of an}} invasive competitor: the congeneric barred <b>owl</b> (<b>S.</b> varia). As barred owls have rapidly expanded their populations into the entire range of the northern spotted owl, mounting evidence indicates that they are displacing, hybridizing with, and even killing spotted owls. The range expansion by barred owls into western North America has made an already complex conservation issue even more contentious, and a lack of information on the ecological relationships between the 2 species has hampered recovery efforts for northern spotted owls. We investigated spatial relationships, habitat use, diets, survival, and reproduction of sympatric spotted owls and barred owls in western Oregon, USA, during 2007 – 2009. Our overall objective was to determine the potential for and possible consequences of competition for space, habitat, and food between these previously allopatric owl species. Our study included 29 spotted owls and 28 barred owls that were radio-marked in 36 neighboring territories and monitored over a 24 -month period. Based on repeated surveys of both species, the number of territories occupied by pairs of barred owls in the 745 -km² study area (82) greatly outnumbered those occupied by pairs of spotted owls (15). Estimates of mean size of home ranges and core-use areas of spotted owls (1, 843 ha and 305 ha, respectively) were 2 – 4 times larger than those of barred owls (581 ha and 188 ha, respectively). Individual spotted and barred owls in adjacent territories often had overlapping home ranges, but interspecific space sharing was largely restricted to broader foraging areas in the home range with minimal spatial overlap among core-use areas. We used an information-theoretic approach to rank discrete-choice models representing alternative hypotheses about the influence of forest conditions, topography, and interspecific interactions on species-specific patterns of nighttime resource selection. Spotted owls spent a disproportionate amount of time foraging on steep slopes in ravines dominated by old (> 120 yr) conifer trees. Barred owls used available forest types more evenly than spotted owls, and were most strongly associated with patches of large hardwood and conifer trees that occupied relatively flat areas along streams. Spotted and barred owls differed in the relative use of old conifer forest (greater for spotted owls) and slope conditions (steeper slopes for spotted owls), but we found no evidence that the 2 species differed in their use of young, mature, and riparian-hardwood forest types. Mean overlap in proportional use of different forest types between individual spotted owls and barred owls in adjacent territories was 81...|$|R
