40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} outcome in 1000 women at term with one lower {{transverse}} Caesarean that was suitable for a <b>trial</b> <b>of</b> labour. Methods: One thousand consecutive women with one previous scar suitable for a <b>trial</b> <b>of</b> labour delivering in our centre from June 2002 to December 2005 were identified from the labour ward register. Data were retrieved from patients' charts, and neonatal admissions were determined. Results: In the study, 76. 8 of women underwent a <b>trial</b> <b>of</b> labour, with a 71. 2 vaginal birth rate. Hospital stay was shorter with a <b>trial</b> <b>of</b> labour. The three perinatal deaths (0. 4; P = 1. 0) occurred in the <b>trial</b> <b>of</b> labour group. Compared to elective repeat Caesareans, successful vaginal births after <b>trial</b> <b>of</b> labour were associated with less neonatal admission, reduced blood transfusion requirement and shorter hospital stay; emergency Caesarean deliveries after a <b>trial</b> <b>of</b> labour were associated with more neonatal admissions and operative complications. Conclusions: <b>Trial</b> <b>of</b> labour {{was associated with a}} shorter hospital stay. A successful <b>trial</b> <b>of</b> labour after one Caesarean was associated with the best outcome underscoring the importance of patient selection for a <b>trial</b> <b>of</b> labour...|$|R
