5|$|Early in the morning, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Penny {{wake up to}} find Sheldon {{playing a}} bongo drum, as Richard Feynman played bongos. <b>They</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him stop but he leaves the apartment, {{eventually}} falling asleep on Amy's couch. The next morning, Penny convinces him to let her cut his hair, although she ends up accidentally shaving off part {{of the back of}} his hair.|$|E
5|$|The hunt of {{the pilot}} whale is known by the locals as the Grindadráp. There are no fixed hunting seasons. As soon as a pod close enough to land is spotted, the locals set out to begin the hunt, after {{approval}} from the sysselman. The animals are driven into a bay which is approved for whaling by the Faroese government, and then <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the whales to beach themselves. The only way out is being blocked off {{by some of the}} boats, which stay there until men who have been waiting on shore have slaughtered all the whales.|$|E
5|$|When cats become aggressive, <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{themselves}} appear {{larger and}} more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting. Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth {{in an effort to}} further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.|$|E

25|$|The live {{rock with}} mantis shrimp burrows are {{actually}} considered useful by {{some in the}} marine aquarium trade and are often collected. It {{is not uncommon for}} a piece of live rock to convey a live mantis shrimp into an aquarium. Once inside the tank, they may feed on fish and other inhabitants. They are notoriously difficult to catch when established in a well-stocked tank, and there are accounts of them breaking glass tanks. While stomatopods do not eat coral, smashers can damage it if <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a home within it.|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 9 December 1993, {{this episode}} {{describes}} {{the migration of}} most animals northwards (some from the Antarctic continent, others from the few islands surrounding it) as the continent and surrounding sea freeze over {{at the end of}} summer. At Cape Royds, the most southernly colony of Adelie penguins is virtually emptied as adults lead their newly feathered young to the sea. Young penguins often fall prey to leopard seals as <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their way across the already partially frozen water — and their stripped remains become food for isopods and meter-long nemerteans. However, before going to the sea, the adult penguins must moult their coats. The freezing sea ice usually does not reach South Georgia, and seal pups are still fed there by their mothers in autumn to be ready for the winter. They use their remaining time for play and mock fights in the ocean. Those who do not survive become food for the predator birds — the skuas and the giant petrels. Elephant seals also undergo moulting while on the island. Albatrosses nesting on South Georgia continue to feed and mate, but the ever harsher weather forces most animals further northwards.|$|E

We're already enjoying a lot of the new stuff. We want to make the strongest album we can do.

500|$|The typical mission {{given by}} the King of All Cosmos is the [...] "Make a Star" [...] mode, where the player needs to grow the katamari to a {{specific}} size within a given timeframe. Other missions have more specific collecting rules, such as collecting as many items (swans, crabs, pairs) as possible within a given time, or collecting the largest item possible (such as a cow or bear). [...] The player can attempt a score attack mode for any level, in which <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the greatest katamari possible in the time allotted. [...] Certain levels can unlock an [...] "eternal mode" [...] by creating an exceptionally large katamari. In eternal modes, the player can explore the level with no time limit.|$|E

He said that [...] "the whole joke is that Homer is cast to play a guy who's an everyman and <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him into this physically fit guy." [...] Rogen {{also noted that the}} plot mirrors the situation he was in while working on the film The Green Hornet, when he had to lose weight and do physical training for his role. Show runner Al Jean commented that the writers tried not to repeat the comic book film theme from the [...] "Radioactive Man" [...] episode. Instead they decided to parody the fact that almost every comic book {{has been turned into a}} film. Jean commented that that scene in the episode in which the studio executives [...] "are trying to think up an idea that hasn't been done really is what they are doing these days [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The police detain Brandon {{on charges}} that arose prior to his relocation; they place him in the women's section of the Falls City prison. Lana bails Brandon out and asks why he {{was placed in a}} women's prison. Brandon {{attempts}} to lie to her, saying he was born a hermaphrodite and will soon receive a sex change; but Lana stops him, declaring her love for Brandon regardless of his gender. However, while Brandon is in prison, Candace finds a number of documents listing Brandon's birth name, Teena Brandon, and she and her friends react upon these news with shock and disgust. Tom and John violently confront Brandon, forcing him to remove his pants and reveal his genitals. <b>They</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Lana look, but she shields her eyes and turns away. After this confrontation, Tom and John drag Brandon into John's car and drive to an isolated location, where they brutally beat and gang rape him. Afterwards, they take Brandon to Tom's house. Though injured, Brandon escapes through a bathroom window. Although his assailants threaten Brandon and warn him not to report the attack to the police, Lana persuades him to do so. This, however, is of no help whatsoever, as the police chief focuses not on the crime but on Brandon's 'sexual identity crisis.' ...|$|E

500|$|Back in Scranton, Jim and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) {{have been}} named the {{reluctant}} heads of the Party Planning Committee by Michael due to previous fights between Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) and Angela (Angela Kinsey). Jim and Dwight prove terrible at the job, especially when an upset Kelly (Mindy Kaling) chastises them for forgetting her birthday. <b>They</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it up to her by throwing a party but they do a poor job, choosing horrible decorations and forgetting Kelly's age. Dwight reads her file and learns Kelly spent time in juvenile hall, but is disappointed to learn it does not affect her job performance. Meanwhile, Andy (Ed Helms) finds himself attracted to Julia, a female potential client who is talking with Stanley (Leslie David Baker). Andy repeatedly acts awkwardly in front of Julia, and accidentally sets off her car alarm while trying to look inside {{and find out what}} music she likes. Andy admits his attraction to her to Stanley, who then gives the potential client over to Andy in exchange for two of his clients. [...] After walking her out to the car, Andy tries to kiss her, but is immediately rebuked. Andy apologizes and mentions that he just got out of a relationship. The client claims she also just got out of a relationship and Andy starts feeling a connection, but she still rejects him and he loses the account.|$|E
2500|$|Theory: Sometimes {{the subject}} matter of the affirmative's case will create an uneven playing field from the beginning. In these cases, the {{negative}} can resort to making objections as to the procedure or content of the affirmative case.

2500|$|McTavish {{was also}} {{instrumental}} {{in a major}} but still popular retroactive continuity (retcon) storyline in 1993. Shortly after being introduced, the audience soon learns Kendall Hart (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is actually Erica's long-lost daughter. Kendall was conceived after Erica was raped on her 14th birthday by her father's actor friend Richard Fields. After she became pregnant, Erica gave her baby up for adoption to the Harts, a couple from Florida. Kendall comes to Pine Valley after finding out her birth mother is the famous Erica Kane. Kendall longs for Erica's approval but is also angry over her perceived feelings of being 'abandoned' at birth and comes to want payback against her mother. Though <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their family work at first, Kendall acts out [...] and mother and daughter experience a painful, strained, and complicated relationship during {{this time in the}} series. The popular Gellar was proclaimed by some [...] "as the second coming of Erica" [...] in her two years as Kendall Hart from 1993–1995 but left the show to pursue other acting opportunities. Producers ended up waiting at least six years before even contemplating to recast the role (which eventually went to Alicia Minshew in 2002).|$|E
