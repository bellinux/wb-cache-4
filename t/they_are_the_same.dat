5|$|The oceangoing (anadromous) form, {{including}} those returning for spawning, {{are known as}} steelhead in Canada and the U.S. In Tasmania they are commercially propagated in sea cages and are known as ocean trout, although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> species.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of DNA sequences from Australian collections labeled Macrolepiota konradii, M.gracilenta, M.mastoidea, and M.procera {{has shown that}} <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> species as Macrolepiota clelandii. Similarly, several New Zealand collections were historically misidentified as Macrolepiota dolichaula. These names, given originally to European species, were erroneously applied to Australian collections. Else Vellinga subsequently emended the species concept of Macrolepiota clelandii to include specimens with four-spored basidia and pale fruitbody colouring. Phylogenetically, M.clelandii is in a clade with closely related species such as M.procera, M.dolichaula, and M.mastoidea. This clade is sister to a group containing Leucoagaricus and Leucocoprinus species. The presence of clamp connections in the hyphae place M.clelandii in the section Macrolepiota of genus Macrolepiota.|$|E

5|$|Chao {{have also}} made {{occasional}} appearances in Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog comic book series. They debuted in an Sonic Adventure-based story arc, where they work together with Tikal to defeat Chaos. At one point, Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles find a Chao garden and one Chao followed Sonic home, and after spending time around his Roboticized father came to resemble Omochao. However, Eggman destroys the garden, and the Chao migrate to a lake. Much later, Cream and her mother Vanilla protect a frightened but incompetent group of Chao from Eggman's assistant, Snively. Cream's friend Amy Rose realizes <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> group from the lake and, to Cream's delight, suggests that the lake {{can be converted to}} a Chao garden. Following the comic reboot, Cheese continued to accompany Cream while Chocola was revealed to live with her mother Vanilla and Gemerl (from Sonic Advance 3). The heroes would also discover a Chao Garden hidden in an undersea cavern whose inhabitants included an ancient Chao named Aquarius and a guard dog-like Chao named Crusher.|$|E

25|$|And {{there are}} other variations. In most traditions at least three Marys are present at the Crucifixion and at the Resurrection, but again traditions differ as to the identities of these three, and as to whether <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> three at these two events.|$|E
25|$|Autocrine {{signals are}} {{produced}} by the target cell, are secreted, and affect the target cell itself via receptors.

25|$|However, one can {{determine}} if two manifolds are different {{if there is}} some intrinsic characteristic that differentiates them. Such criteria are commonly referred to as invariants, because, while they may be defined in terms of some presentation (such as the genus in terms of a triangulation), <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> relative to all possible descriptions of a particular manifold: they are invariant under different descriptions.|$|E

25|$|Dizygotic twins, {{like any}} other siblings, have an {{extremely}} small chance of having the same chromosome profile.

Like any other siblings, dizygotic twins may look similar, particularly given that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> age. However, dizygotic twins may also look very different from each other.|$|E
25|$|Simple point {{processes}} are completely characterized by their void probabilities. In other words, complete information {{of a simple}} point process is captured entirely in its void probabilities, and two simple {{point processes}} have the same void probabilities if and if only if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> point processes. The case for Poisson process is sometimes known as Rényi's theorem, which is named after Alfréd Rényi who discovered the result for {{the case of a}} homogeneous point process in one-dimension.|$|E

25|$|Every {{electronic}} {{hearing aid}} has at minimum a microphone, a loudspeaker (commonly called a receiver), a battery, and electronic circuitry.

25|$|In both traditions, the Kālacakra and its related commentaries (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Bodhisattvas Corpus) were returned to India in 966CE by an Indian pandit.

Scholars such as Helmut Hoffman have suggested <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> person. The first masters of the tradition disguised themselves with pseudonyms, so the Indian oral traditions recorded by the Tibetans contain a mass of contradictions.|$|E
25|$|While Matthew groups Jesus' teachings into sets {{of similar}} {{material}}, {{the same material}} is scattered when found in Luke.

25|$|This logical {{addressing}} structure {{permits the}} selective routing of IP packets across multiple networks via special gateway computers, called routers, to a destination host if the network prefixes of origination and destination hosts differ, or sent {{directly to a}} target host on the local network if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Routers constitute logical or physical borders between the subnets, and manage traffic between them. Each subnet is served by a designated default router, but may consist internally of multiple physical Ethernet segments interconnected by network switches or network bridges.|$|E
25|$|Other {{researchers}} {{describe the}} nature connectedness construct in a simpler manner. For instance, nature connectedness {{can be thought}} of as a love of nature (also referred to as emotional affinity toward nature). Similarly, nature connectedness can be defined as how much a person believes <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as nature (more specifically, a person's connectivity with nature) or it {{can be thought of}} as simply feeling emotionally connected with nature. Nature connectedness (as a construct) is also known as nature relatedness, connectivity with nature, emotional affinity toward nature, or inclusion of nature in self.|$|E
