5|$|The {{project was}} revived in January2008 with Eros International and <b>the</b> <b>London-based</b> {{production}} company Ayngaran International willing {{to produce the}} film. The state government of Tamil Nadu granted tax exemptions for films titled in Tamil, resulting in the new production being renamed Enthiran. While Sujatha Rangarajan was originally assigned to write the dialogue for the film, Madhan Karky took over after Rangarajan's death in February2008.|$|E
5|$|In various recipes, other substitutions and {{additions}} are suggested. The Hairy Bikers (Dave Myers and Si King) suggest Welsh cheddar as {{an alternative}} to Caerphilly and propose that it should be served with a red onion and chilli pepper relish. An Australian recipe suggests Lancashire cheese {{as an alternative}} ingredient. Regarding the breadcrumbs, chef Bobby Freeman suggests using half brown and half white breadcrumbs, while the cookbook for <b>the</b> <b>London-based</b> restaurant Canteen proposes using a combination of boiled potatoes and breadcrumbs for the coating of the sausage.|$|E

5|$|Led Zeppelin's next album, Houses of the Holy, was {{released}} in March 1973. It featured further experimentation by the band, who expanded their use of synthesisers and mellotron orchestration. The predominantly orange album cover, designed by <b>the</b> <b>London-based</b> design group Hipgnosis, depicts images of nude children climbing the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Although the children are not shown from the front, the cover was controversial {{at the time of}} the album's release. As with the band's fourth album, neither their name nor the album title was printed on the sleeve.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the staff}} from the Ludlow {{incarnation}} of Hibiscus agreed to move to London to continue working at the restaurant, including head chef Marcus McGuinness and sommelier Simon Freeman. Hibiscus re-opened in October 2007 in its new location after following building works and planning delays. The interior of <b>the</b> <b>London-based</b> restaurant was decorated in orange and shades of brown. The walls were covered in pale-coloured wooden panels, and a chandelier designed {{as a series of}} globes hungs {{from the middle of the}} main dining room's ceiling.|$|E
5|$|The art {{department}} {{made sure}} that the 2035 underground world would only use pre-1996 technology {{as a means to}} depict the bleakness of the future. Gilliam, Beecroft, and Crispian Sallis (set decorator) went to several flea markets and salvage warehouses looking for materials to decorate the sets. The majority of visual effects sequences were created by Peerless Camera, <b>the</b> <b>London-based</b> effects studio that Gilliam founded in the late 1970s with visual effects supervisor Kent Houston (The Golden Compass, Casino Royale). Additional digital compositing was done by The Mill, while Cinesite provided film scanning services.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} of Nazi Germany announced {{the discovery of}} mass graves in the Katyn Forest in 1943. When <b>the</b> <b>London-based</b> Polish government-in-exile asked for {{an investigation by the}} International Committee of the Red Cross, Stalin immediately severed diplomatic relations with it. The USSR claimed that the victims had been murdered by the Nazis in 1941 and continued to deny responsibility for the massacres until 1990, when it officially acknowledged and condemned the perpetration of the killings by the NKVD, as well as the subsequent cover-up by the Soviet government.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} {{is located}} {{in front of the}} main entrance to Government House, {{one of the most prominent}} buildings in Adelaide, on the corner of North Terrace and King William Street. It was constructed with a budget of £2500 raised through public donations, and was designed by <b>the</b> <b>London-based</b> sculptor Adrian Jones. While the statue itself was not intended to represent any particular soldier, there is evidence suggesting that the head of the rider was based on that of George Henry Goodall.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{arm of the}} Polish Underground State consisted {{primarily of}} various branches of the Armia Krajowa (AK) and, until 1942, the Union of Armed Struggle. This arm of the state was designed to prepare the Polish society for a future fight for the country's liberation. Apart from armed resistance, sabotage, intelligence, training, and propaganda, the state's military arm was responsible for maintaining communication with <b>the</b> <b>London-based</b> government in exile, and for protecting the civilian arm of the state.|$|E

5|$|Among other {{inhabitants}} of London are 10,000 red foxes, {{so that there}} are now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into the Houses of Parliament, where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another broke into the grounds of Buckingham Palace, reportedly killing some of Queen ElizabethII's prized pink flamingos. Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. A survey in 2001 by <b>the</b> <b>London-based</b> Mammal Society found that 80 percent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around. This sample cannot be taken to represent Londoners as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal had {{a better}} European record, {{compared}} to Galatasaray going into the match; they defeated Anderlecht with a 4–3 aggregate winning result, in {{the final of the}} 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. <b>The</b> <b>London–based</b> club reached the Cup Winners' Cup finales three times, in 1980, where they suffered a 4–5 defeat in a penalty shoot-out to Valencia, following a 0–0 stalemate; Arsenal also reached the 1994 final, winning 1–0 over Parma, and the following edition, losing 1–2 at the hands of Real Zaragoza. Their 1994 success led to them qualifying for that year's European Super Cup, where they were beaten 2–0 by Milan on aggregate in two games. This was Arsenal's first UEFA Cup (sixth in total) European final. The club were considered favorites to win the match.|$|E
5|$|As more {{information}} about Burge's reign was published, activists worked to save some Chicago inmates on death row {{who claimed to have}} been wrongfully convicted. In 1998, representatives from the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Chicago Law School, <b>the</b> <b>London-based</b> International Center for Criminal Law and Human Rights, law professor Anthony Amsterdam, former federal judges George N. Leighton and Abner Mikva, Illinois judge R. Eugene Pincham, and British activist Bianca Jagger, called for a stay of execution for Aaron Patterson, a death row inmate from Chicago. His conviction for murder was based primarily on a confession which he claimed was coerced by torture from Burge and his officers.|$|E

5|$|David Scott's (1806–49) {{most ambitious}} {{historical}} work was the triptych Sir William Wallace, Scottish Wars: the Spear and English War: the Bow (1843). He also produced etchings for versions of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress and J. P. Nichol's Architecture of the Heavens (1850). Because of this early death {{he was known}} to, and admired by, the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood mainly through his brother William Bell Scott (1811–90), who became {{a close friend of}} founding member D. G. Rossetti. <b>The</b> <b>London-based</b> Pre-Raphaelites rejected the formalism of Mannerist painting after Raphael. Bell Scott was patronised by the Pre-Raphaelite collector James Leathart. His most famous work, Iron and Coal {{was one of the most}} popular Victorian images and one of the few to fulfill the Pre-Raphaelite ambition to depict the modern world.|$|E
5|$|Ford's {{first step}} into {{organised}} team football came with local Swansea based side Tower United, joining the club {{at the age}} of 15 as a full-back. Despite his young age, he played for the senior men's side in local amateur leagues where he attracted scouts from several clubs. The scouts included Albert Lindon of Arsenal, who invited Ford and teammate Frank Davies to attend a trial in Cardiff. Ford impressed enough to be offered an amateur contract with <b>the</b> <b>London-based</b> side, which was initially to be withheld until the end of hostilities in the Second World War. However, Ford himself rejected the contract as he felt he was too young too move away from his home and family.|$|E
