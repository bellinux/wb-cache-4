500|$|In 1908, {{his final}} season, {{the team was}} christened as the Zanesville Infants and joined the Central League. [...] According to Sporting Life, the [...] "schedule meeting" [...] for the Central League that year was {{to be held in}} Zanesville on March 17 (St. Patrick's Day). [...] "According to the plans of the magnates the season <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>will</b> consist of 140 games, not any of the club owners being willing to return to the 154-game schedule", the paper reported. [...] The paper added that Hogan was [...] "making light of his task" [...] of signing up players for his team. [...] "His {{acquaintance}} with players, especially in the independent ranks, gives him an advantage which few managers have". [...] Sporting Life also reported that by March, Hogan had [...] "signed his outfield, the players accepting terms being [...] Elson, Blount, and Miller". [...] Further {{research is needed to determine}} the Zanesville Infants' league ranking at the close of the 1908 season, but available information shows that the team neither won the championship nor placed as a runner-up. [...] More information is available on Hogan's dissatisfaction with his situation in Zanesville, which evidently stemmed from increasing limits on his control over the club. [...] An article that appeared in The (Pittsburgh) Gazette Times in December 1908 described Hogan's reasons for leaving the organization. [...] "There were too many directors connected with the Zanesville club to suit Hogan, as each one had his own idea of how a club should be run", the paper reported. [...] "As Hogan has his own, which did not exactly coincide with the numerous directors, he resigned". [...] The Gazette Times praised Hogan's performance in Zanesville, stating that his club [...] "was a pennant contender at all stages of the championship race". [...] The paper added: [...] "He did not have a very good team, but kept the men playing the game at all times and was really the wonder of the [...] league".|$|E
2500|$|In 1916 {{the young}} {{engineer}} Louis Waldman was approached {{at a meeting}} of his Socialist Party branch and was drafted into becoming a candidate of the party for the New York State Assembly.

Who said anything about campaigning? We just want someone to run for office. If you get more than seven hundred votes we'll be lucky. The real campaigns <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>will</b> be for Meyer London and Morris Hillquit." [...] And thus was born a Socialist Party politician. Waldman did actually campaign, however, mounting the platform to give public speeches, at which he gradually improved.

6000|$|The money must be found, and we {{hold that}} Parliament, in {{imposing}} the inevitable taxes, is entitled {{not only to}} lay a heavier proportionate burden upon the rich than on the poor, but also to lay a special burden upon certain forms of wealth which are clearly social in their origin, and have not at any point been derived from a useful or productive process {{on the part of}} their possessors. But it may be said, [...] "Your plans include other expenditure besides the Navy and Old-age Pensions. What about Insurance, Labour Exchanges, and economic development?" [...] Those objects, at least, it may be urged are not inevitable or indispensable. It is quite true that the taxation which we seek to impose this year, and which is sufficient, and only sufficient for the needs of <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> <b>will</b> yield more abundant revenues in future years, and if {{at the same time a}} reduction in the expenditure on armaments becomes possible, we shall have substantial revenues at our disposal. That is perfectly true, but is that a reason for condemning the Budget? When we see on every hand great nations which cannot pay their way, which have to borrow merely to carry on from year to year, when we see how sterile and unproductive all the dodges and devices of their protective tariffs have become, when we remember how often we have ourselves been told that under Free Trade no more revenue could be got, is it not a welcome change for our country, and for our Free Trade policy, to find our opponents complaining of the expansive nature of a Free Trade revenue? I don't wonder that Tory Protectionists have passed a resolution at Birmingham declaring that the Budget will indefinitely postpone--that was the phrase--the scheme of Tariff Reform.|$|E
6000|$|A Colonel Wunsch (Lieutenant-Colonel of the Free Corps WUNSCH) {{distinguished}} {{himself in}} this Expedition; The beginning of notably great things {{to him in}} the few following months. Wunsch is a Wurtemberger by birth; has been in many services, always in subaltern posts, and, <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> <b>will</b> testify strangely how worthy he was of the higher. What a Year, this of 1759, to stout old Wunsch! In the Spring, here has he just seen his poor son, Lieutenant Wunsch, perish in one of these scuffles; in Autumn, he will see himself a General, shining suddenly bright, to his King and to all the world; before Winter, he will be Prisoner to Austria, and eclipsed {{for the rest of this}} war!--Kleist, of the GREEN HUSSARS, also made a figure here; and onwards rapidly ever higher; to the top of renown in his business:--fallen heir to Mayer's place, as it were. A Note says: [...] "Poor Mayer of the Free Corps does not ride with the Prince on this occasion. Mayer, dangerously worn down with the hard services of last Year, and himself a man of too sleepless temper, caught a fever in the New-year time; and died within few days: burnt away before his time; much regretted by his Brethren of the Army, and some few others. Gone in this way; with a high career just opening on him at the long last! Mayer was of Austrian, of half Spanish birth; a musical, really melodious, affectionate, but indignant, wildly stormful mortal; and had had adventures without end. Something of pathos, of tragedy, in the wild Life of him. [Still worth reading: in Pauli (our old watery BRANDENBURG-HISTORY Friend). Leben grosser Helden (Halle, 1759-1764, 9 vols.), iii. 142-188;--much the best Piece in that still rather watery (or windy) Collection, which, however, is authentic, and has some tolerable Portraits.] A man of considerable genius, military and other:--genius in the sleepless kind, which is not the best kind; sometimes a very bad kind. The fame of Friedrich invites such people from all sides of the world; and this was no doubt a sensible help to him."--But enough of all this.|$|E
6000|$|So, {{the freight}} on these bars {{probably}} averaged {{something more than}} $25 each. Small shippers paid two per cent. There were three stages a day, each way, and I have seen the out-going stages carry away {{a third of a}} ton of bullion each, and more than once I saw them divide a two-ton lot and take it off. However, these were extraordinary events. [Mr. Valentine, Wells Fargo's agent, has handled all the bullion shipped through the Virginia office for many a month. To his memory--which is excellent--we are indebted for the following exhibit of the company's business in the Virginia office since the first of January, 1862: From January 1st to April 1st, about $270,000 worth of bullion passed through that office, during the next quarter, $570,000; next quarter, $800,000; next quarter, $956,000; next quarter, $1,275,000; and for the quarter ending on the 30th of last June, about $1,600,000. Thus {{in a year and a}} half, the Virginia office only shipped $5,330,000 in bullion. During the year 1862 they shipped $2,615,000, so we perceive the average shipments have more than doubled in the last six months. This gives us room to promise for the Virginia office $500,000 a month for the year 1863 (though perhaps, judging by the steady increase in the business, we are under estimating, somewhat). This gives us $6,000,000 for the year. Gold Hill and Silver City together can beat us--we will give them $10,000,000. To Dayton, Empire City, Ophir and Carson City, we will allow an aggregate of $8,000,000, which is not over the mark, perhaps, and may possibly be a little under it. To Esmeralda we give $4,000,000. To Reese River and Humboldt $2,000,000, which is liberal now, but may not be before the year is out. So we prognosticate that the yield of bullion <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>will</b> be about $30,000,000. Placing the number of mills in the Territory at one hundred, this gives to each the labor of producing $300,000 in bullion during the twelve months. Allowing them to run three hundred days in the year (which none of them more than do), this makes their work average $1,000 a day. Say the mills average twenty tons of rock a day and this rock worth $50 as a general thing, and you have the actual work of our one hundred mills figured down [...] "to a spot"--$1,000 a day each, and $30,000,000 a year in the aggregate.--Enterprise.
