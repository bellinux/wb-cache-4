5|$|At the {{transport}} layer, most communication adopts either the <b>Transmission</b> <b>Control</b> Protocol (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP is used {{when it is}} essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP is used when it is merely desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers. With UDP, packets are not ordered or retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP packets carry port numbers with them to specify what application or process the packet should be handled by. Because certain application-level protocols use certain ports, network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning priority.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Development of {{efficient}} <b>transmission</b> power <b>control</b> algorithms providing {{both high}} energy efficiency and good link quality is the current major focus in wireless sensor networks research. In the paper, we propose an efficient <b>transmission</b> power <b>control</b> algorithm for wireless sensor networks, namely, the on-demand <b>transmission</b> power <b>control</b> (ODTPC) algorithm. This new algorithm attempts to reduce the initialization overhead in determining the optimal transmission power level while providing good link qualities. Our testbed experiment results show that ODTPC consumes much less energy than previous <b>transmission</b> power <b>control</b> algorithms (PCBL [11] and ATPC [12]) and is easily implemented with routing protocols like AODV [15] and Directed Diffusion [16].

25|$|The Internet {{protocol}} suite is the conceptual model and set of communications protocols {{used on the}} Internet and similar computer networks.

25|$|By {{the summer}} of 1973, Kahn and Cerf had worked out a {{fundamental}} reformulation, in which the differences between local network protocols were hidden by using a common internetwork protocol, and, instead of the network being responsible for reliability, as in the ARPANET, this function was delegated to the hosts. Cerf credits Hubert Zimmermann and Louis Pouzin, designer of the CYCLADES network, with important influences on this design. The protocol was implemented as the <b>Transmission</b> <b>Control</b> Program, first published in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Real-time {{multimedia}} streaming applications require timely {{delivery of}} information and often can tolerate some packet loss to achieve this goal. For example, loss of a packet in audio application may result in loss of {{a fraction of a}} second of audio data, which can be made unnoticeable with suitable error concealment algorithms. The <b>Transmission</b> <b>Control</b> Protocol (TCP), although standardized for RTP use, is not normally used in RTP applications because TCP favors reliability over timeliness. Instead the majority of the RTP implementations are built on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Other transport protocols specifically designed for multimedia sessions are SCTP and DCCP, although, , they are not in widespread use.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—To extend an {{available}} {{period of}} wireless sensor networks, <b>transmission</b> power <b>control</b> {{is regarded as}} one of the promising schemes. In most of the previous studies on the <b>transmission</b> power <b>control,</b> it is assumed that a transmitter has power consumption of O(dn), where d and n denote a maximum communication distance and a pass loss factor. This assumption would substantially hold under the condition that the transmission efficiency is always constant at any transmission power (efficiency-fixed model). In practice, however, the trans-mission efficiency degrades as the transmission power is reduced. We analytically verify that an actual power amplifier with the efficiency degradation has a power consumption of O(dr), where n/ 2. 8 ≤ r ≤ n/ 2 (efficiency-degradation model). The efficiency-degradation model gives the negative impact against the <b>transmission</b> power <b>control.</b> Index Terms—Wireless sensor network, <b>transmission</b> power <b>control,</b> <b>transmission</b> efficiency, pass loss factor.
