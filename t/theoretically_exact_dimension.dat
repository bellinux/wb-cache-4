50|$|In {{technical}} drawing, a {{basic dimension}} is a <b>theoretically</b> <b>exact</b> <b>dimension,</b> given from a datum to {{a feature of}} interest. In Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing, basic dimensions are defined as a numerical value {{used to describe the}} theoretically exact size, profile, orientation or location of a feature or datum target. Allowable variations from the theoretically exact geometry are indicated by feature control frames, notes, and tolerances on other non-basic dimensions.|$|E
40|$|A {{frequently}} used geometrical tolerance is the position tolerance. When it is assigned at the maximum material condition (MMC), {{an increase in}} the position tolerance is allowed, equal to the departure of the particular feature from the maximum material condition size. Neither concept - position tolerance and maximum material condition - analytically related with the <b>exact</b> coordinate <b>dimensions</b> that locate the feature. A feature position is usually allocated {{on the basis of its}} <b>theoretically</b> <b>exact</b> co-ordinate <b>dimensions,</b> whereas positional accuracy is pursued through an appropriate planning of the machining process in conjunction with appropriate machine tool(s) and/or jig(s). Exploitation of the MMC tolerance bonus is taken into account mainly during part inspection in order to reduce rejects. Such an approach is not systematic, considering that the MMC benefits are not taken directly into account in the process planning stage in order to control the overall process cost. In this paper, the permitted manufacturing errors of a feature size and position are considered and studied simultaneously in an analytical way. It is shown that a lower process capability (PC) requirement can then be established that leads to a significant process cost reduction. An application example demonstrates the use of the method and the obtained results are discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{considers}} structured matrix {{methods for}} {{the calculation of}} the <b>theoretically</b> <b>exact</b> roots of a polynomial whose coefficients are corrupted by noise, and whose exact form contains multiple roots. The addition of noise to the exact coefficients causes the multiple roots of the exact form of the polynomial to break up into simple roots, but the algorithms {{presented in this paper}} preserve the multiplicities of the roots. In particular, even though the given polynomial is corrupted by noise, and all computations are performed on these inexact coefficients, the algorithms ‘sew’ together the simple roots that originate from the same multiple root, thereby preserving the multiplicities of the roots of the <b>theoretically</b> <b>exact</b> form of the polynomial. The algorithms described in this paper do not require that the noise level imposed on the coefficients be known, and all parameters are calculated from the given inexact coefficients.

40|$|State-of-the-art {{filtered}} backprojection (FBP) algorithms often {{define the}} filtering operation {{to be performed}} along oblique filtering lines in the detector. A limited scan field of view leads to the truncation of those filtering lines, which causes artifacts in the final reconstructed volume. In contrast to the case where filtering is performed solely along the detector rows, no methods are available for the case of oblique filtering lines. In this work, the authors present two novel truncation correction methods which effectively handle data truncation in this case. Method 1 (basic approach) handles data truncation in two successive preprocessing steps by applying a hybrid data extrapolation method, which {{is a combination of}} a water cylinder extrapolation and a Gaussian extrapolation. It is independent of any specific reconstruction algorithm. Method 2 (kink approach) uses similar concepts for data extrapolation as the basic approach but needs to be integrated into the reconstruction algorithm. Experiments are presented from simulated data of the FORBILD head phantom, acquired along a partial-circle-plus-arc trajectory. The <b>theoretically</b> <b>exact</b> M-line algorithm is used for reconstruction. Although the discussion is focused on <b>theoretically</b> <b>exact</b> algorithms, the proposed truncation correction methods can be applied to any FBP algorithm that exposes oblique filtering lines...|$|R
