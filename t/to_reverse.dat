40|$|Precast {{concrete}} {{structures are}} not {{widely used in}} severe seismic regions due the limited knowledge of the response of these systems <b>to</b> <b>reversed</b> cyclic loading. A series of four precast concrete wall panels were tested to evaluate their response <b>to</b> <b>reversed</b> cyclic loading. These units represent the wall panels of a typical single storey precast concrete structure. In order to achieve improved ductility and energy absorption characteristic, {{it was found that}} the horizontal sliding of the wall panel along the grout-wall interface must be controlled. Due <b>to</b> the <b>reversed</b> cyclic loading and the increased wall panel participation from limiting the horizontal sliding of the wall, it was determined that shear reinforcement of each precast specimen was separated into three separate component parts, joint rotation, wall panel deformations and horizontal wall panel sliding, to compare and evaluate the seismic performance of the wall panels...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} most recent wave of a nationally {{representative}} dataset to examine the factors associated with elderly homeowners' decision <b>to</b> obtain <b>reverse</b> mortgage loans.

However, homeowners who were risk averse, and homeowners in the two highest quartiles of net worth were more likely <b>to</b> have <b>reverse</b> mortgage loans. Further analyses reveal that among the reverse mortgage participants, homeowners with long-term care insurance coverage were less likely <b>to</b> have <b>reverse</b> mortgage loans.
