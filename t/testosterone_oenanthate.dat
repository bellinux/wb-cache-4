40|$|Summary. Serum {{prolactin}} {{levels in}} intact, castrated, and castrated adrenalec-tomized normal and male pseudohermaphrodite (Tfm) rats were compared {{before and after}} administering <b>testosterone</b> <b>oenanthate</b> and oestradiol benzoate. Without steroids, castration alone and castration plus adrenalectomy effected a drop in pro-lactin titres which was greater in the castrated=n-. Although testosterone did not raise the prolactin titres {{in any of the}} animals studied, oestrogen raised them far above normal in all. The fall in prolactin following castration and castration + adrenalectomy could be the result of removal of organs that were pro-ducing oestrogen...|$|E
40|$|A. Evidence for {{carcinogenicity}} {{to humans}} (limited) Cases of benign hepatoma, peliosis hepatis, primary hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic cholangiocarcinoma have aIl {{been linked to}} the use of androgenic steroids, mostly oxymetholonel- 13. At least 25 cases ofliver-cell tumour have been reported in patients with Fanconi's anaemial- 6, 11, 12, aplastie anaemial, 4, 7, 8, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinurial, 12, 13, panmyelopathy 9 or megaloblastic anaemia 10 treated with oxymetholone alone or in combination with other androgenic steroid drugs. Usually, treatment was given for years, but cancer has occurred within as little as two months of therapy 6, and there have been well-documented instances of remission following the withdrawal of oxymetholone treatment 8, 9, 1 1. Hepatocellular carcinomas were also reported after extended treatment with oxymetholone of one patient with nephrolithiasisl 4 and of another with chronic renal failurel 5; and hepatocellular carcinomasl, 16, cholangiocarcinomasl 5 and adenomasl 6 were reported after extended treatment of patients with methyItestosterone, <b>testosterone</b> <b>oenanthate</b> and nandrolone decanoate for hypogonadisml 6, hypopituitarism 13, chronic renal failurel 5 and generalized weaknessl 5...|$|E
40|$|The {{androgenic}} {{effects of}} testosterone and dihydrotestosterone on the bovine seminal vesicles {{have been evaluated}} by (i) introducing the steroid directly into one seminal vesicle in situ, while retaining the other vesicle as a control or for the introduction of another steroid, or (ii) injecting the steroid subcutaneously into a whole animal, and examining the seminal vesicles after autopsy. When introduced directly into a seminal vesicle dihydrotestosterone oenanthate stimulated growth {{and the formation of}} fructose and citric acid, but the magnitude of the effect was not greater than that of a similar dose of <b>testosterone</b> <b>oenanthate.</b> When twin calves were injected subcutaneously, one with dihydrotesto-sterone propionate, and the other with the same dose of testosterone propionate, only the latter responded with increased output of fructose, citric acid and =amannosidasein electro-ejaculated semen. But the seminal vesicles grew to approximately the same size in both twins. Parenterally administered bovine growth hormone produced a sudden but transient burst of secretory activity in the seminal vesicles, resulting in the appearance of fructose and citric acid in electro-ejaculated semen...|$|E
40|$|The {{secretory}} {{activity of}} male accessory organs of reproduction {{such as the}} prostate, seminal vesicle, Cowper's gland and similar organs, differs in many ways from that of other secretory organs in the animal body. DEPENDENCE ON ANDROGENS One of the characteristics, which is perhaps most remarkable {{and in some ways}} unique, is the specific dependence of the function of organs such as the prostate and seminal vesicle upon the presence of androgenic stimuli. In its extreme form this dependence is clearly reflected in the well documented and much studied set of phenomena of post-castrate involution and testosterone-induced resump-tion of growth in the accessory organs. Testosterone acts on the male accessory organs directly, without having first to undergo metabolic alteration in the animal body. Convincing proof of such direct action was provided by an experi-ment recently carried out on bull seminal vesicles in vivo, in which testosterone was injected locally into one seminal vesicle in situ, while the other was left as an untreated control: 3 weeks after local introduction of 10 mg <b>testosterone</b> <b>oenanthate,</b> the treated seminal vesicle was twice as large and contained four times as much fructose and citric acid as the untreated control (Mann, Rowson, Baronos & Karagiannidis, 1971). In the course of the same investigation we have also compared the stimulating potency of testosterone with that of 5 a-dihydrotestosterone, an androgenic steroid to which testosterone is known to be converted in the male accessor...|$|E
40|$|The obstructive sleep apnoea {{syndrome}} occurs predominantly in men. To {{determine the}} effect of testosterone on ventilatory function and whether testosterone {{may play a role in}} the development of obstructive apnoea, we performed waking ventilatory drive studies and sleep studies in five hypogonadal men. These androgen-deficient subjects were studied both while receiving no treatment and after six weeks of testosterone replacement therapy (<b>testosterone</b> <b>oenanthate</b> 200 mg i. m. every 2 weeks). Hypoxic ventilatory drive decreased significantly, from 158 +/- 39 (mean +/- SEM) off testosterone to 88 +/- 19 on testosterone therapy (P less than 0. 05). Hypercapnoeic ventilatory drive did not change significantly on testosterone. Obstructive sleep apnoea developed in one man and markedly worsened in another man in association with testosterone administration. Both of these subjects also exhibited marked decreases in oxygen saturation with the development of cardiac dysrhythmias during sleep and large increases in haematocrit. The remaining three hypogonadal men did not demonstrate significant sleep apnoea either on or off testosterone. The percentage of sleep time spent in REM sleep increased from 14 +/- 3 % to 22 +/- 2 % when the men were receiving testosterone (P less than 0. 01), but the episodes of sleep apnoea tended to occur during non-REM sleep. We conclude that in some hypogonadal men, replacement dosages of testosterone may affect ventilatory drives and induce or worsen obstructive sleep apnoea. The obstructive {{sleep apnoea syndrome}} is a potential complication of testosterone therapy. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ...|$|E
