5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This article {{presents}} a local control approach to linear vehicle platooning. Linear platoon systems are sets of vehicles that use local or global perception capabilities <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> configuration, without any hard grip element. Public transportation {{is beginning to}} interest in pla-toon systems as a technological base to conceive new services. The main problem related to platoon system’s control corresponds with maintain-ing inter-vehicle distance. In literature, the platoon’s geometry control problem is treated according to two approaches: global or local vehicle control. This paper focuses on a local approach which does not require sophisticated sensors and/or costly road equipment. This local control approach intends to obtain very good global matching to arbitrary tra-jectories, only from local perception which consists in measuring the vectorial distance between a given vehicle and its predecessor. The be-havior of each platoon vehicle is determined from a physics inspired multi agent interaction model based on a virtual spring-damper. Furthermore, stability, platoon safety properties are checked using physics and math-ematical proofs. Finally, simulation is used to measure trajectory error and inter-vehicle distance evolution. Key words: Platoon, local control, stability proof, simulation...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to quantify Hsp 70 proteins and mRNAs in non-stressed bovine tissues, skeletal muscle undergoing heat shock and during cardiac muscle anoxia. Antibodies that show specificity against the inducible Hsp 70 were developed and used in immunofluorescence and quantitative ELISA experiments. Tissue surveys using the ELISA assay demonstrated Hsp 70 {{to be present in}} all tissues, with skeletal muscle about three fold higher than the other tissues at about 9 ng/μg. Immunofluorescence results in non-stressed ovine skeletal muscle showed Hsp 70 to be mostly located in the sarcoplasm and a small but specific staining pattern suggestive of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) staining was observed. Skeletal muscle fractionation studies demonstrated about 1 % of Hsp 70 to be localized in the SR. Skeletal muscle heat shock and cardiac muscle anoxia determined that Hsp 70 could be elevated by either of these insults, with heat shock increasing Hsp 70 levels about two fold. Temporary cardiac anoxia experiments demonstrated that Hsp 70 could be partially increased by initial handling of the heart, but after 3 hours following the release of a complete aortic clamp, Hsp 70 levels had increased about four fold over basal levels. A cDNA for bovine skeletal muscle Hsp 70 was isolated and used for RNAse protection assays and expression experiments. Results from RNAse protection assays demonstrated the presence of the complete cDNA in all tissues examined with a pattern of expression between tissues similar to Hsp 70 protein profiles. Skeletal muscle contained the highest level of Hsp 70 mRNA, about three fold higher than brain. Skeletal muscle heat shock experiments demonstrated about a four fold increase in the level of Hsp 70 mRNA from 0. 4 pg/μg total RNA to about 1. 65 pg/μg total RNA. Bacterial expression and purification of the cDNA product demonstrated the recombinant protein to have identical mobility in polyacrylamide gels containing SDS and crossreactivity to Hsp 70 antibodies as the inducible Hsp 70. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the recombinant protein encodes a minor isoform in skeletal muscle, and carbamylation of the recombinant protein showed the carbamylated protein <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> similar to bovine skeletal muscle heat shock protein...|$|E
