5000|$|Daly and Wilson {{report that}} this parental love can explain why genetic {{offspring}} are more immune <b>to</b> <b>lashing</b> <b>out</b> by parents. They assert that, [...] "Child-specific parental {{love is the}} emotional mechanism that permits people to tolerate—even to rejoice in—those long years of expensive, unreciprocated parental investment". They point to a study comparing natural father and stepfather families as support for the notion that stepparents do not view their stepchildren {{the same as their}} biological children, and likewise, children do not view their stepparents the same as their biological parents. [...] This study, based on a series of questionnaires which were then subjected to statistical analyses, reports that children are less likely to go to their stepfathers for guidance and that stepfathers rate their stepchildren less positively than do natural fathers.|$|R

25|$|Mal Loye and Brad Hodge helped Lancashire Lightning {{to recover}} after Stuart Law was stumped {{in the second}} over off Durham Dynamos medium-pacer Neil Killeen. Loye and Hodge paired up for 169 for the second wicket, as Loye became the second Lancastrian to score a Twenty20 century this season before he was {{eventually}} caught off Nathan Astle's bowling for 100. Lancashire closed on 208 for 4, and only Killeen conceded less than 30 runs of Durham's six bowlers. Astle got the best bowling figures, with two for 37, but his batting helped little - 55 for 37 was never enough {{to keep up with}} the asking rate of 10.5. When Durham realised that, they tried <b>to</b> <b>lash</b> <b>out,</b> and a result, wickets tumbled to Glen Chapple and Dominic Cork and Durham finished their 20 overs with the score on 171 for 7.|$|E
25|$|During {{the final}} {{few years of}} his life Guthrie was largely alone except for family. The {{progression}} of Huntington's threw Guthrie into extreme emotional states causing him <b>to</b> <b>lash</b> <b>out</b> at those nearby and to damage a prized book collection of Anneke's. These actions mirrored common symptoms of Huntington's including uncharacteristic aggression, emotional volatility, and social disinhibition. Guthrie's illness was essentially untreated, {{because of a lack of}} information about the disease. His death helped raise awareness of the disease and led Marjorie to help found the Committee to Combat Huntington's Disease, which became the Huntington's Disease Society of America. None of Guthrie's three remaining children with Marjorie have developed symptoms of Huntington's. Mary Guthrie's son Bill died in an auto-train accident in Pomona, California, at the age of 23. Mary's other children, Gwendolyn and Sue, suffered from the disease and both died at 41years of age.|$|E

50|$|The show's {{affiliation}} with Tom Green (a notoriously confrontational prankster), coupled with its internet-only fanbase {{leads to the}} majority of the calls being pranks, insulting Hamburger or his guest(s), shouting racial slurs, or quoting internet memes.

25|$|After {{an opening}} ten overs which yielded 46 runs for Sri Lanka, Sanath Jayasuriya was trapped lbw by Deighton Butler {{with the last}} {{delivery}} of the tenth over, following which Daren Powell and Dwayne Smith tied the Sri Lankans down with good pace bowling.

Mahela Jayawardene gave an heave to Powell, and Sri Lanka were five down for 92, after 25 overs. Banks finished with 26 runs from his ten overs, securing the wicket of Chandana, following which Sri Lanka felt were compelled <b>to</b> <b>lash</b> <b>out</b> {{in order to have}} a go at reaching the target. The part-timer Deonarine got two wickets, including the final one of Russel Arnold, who made a slow 59, before bowling Sri Lanka out to 193 at the end of the 47th over, thereby helping his team win their first game of the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Also {{during this}} time, Kelly's {{mother had a}} new baby, Erin, got married, and put Kelly's {{childhood}} home up for sale. Self-consciousness over her figure, along with the anxiety she began to feel, caused her <b>to</b> <b>lash</b> <b>out</b> emotionally, abuse diet pills, and briefly lose control over her life. The character's physical appearance is shown to {{play a part in}} her development. At various points of the series, she won the title of Spring Princess at a dance, and was voted her school's most beautiful girl. Kelly is aware of her appeal, but not to the point of conceit; instead, she is sometimes shown to be troubled by it. At one point, she entered a phase where she felt that no one took her seriously, which was heightened when Dylan gave his manuscript to Andrea for review instead of to her. During this time, she began to feel that people only liked her because she was physically attractive.|$|E
500|$|In the Tests, Chapman scored 165 runs at 23.57, {{and in all}} {{first-class}} matches {{he reached}} 533 runs and averaged 33.31. Southerton summarised his performance: [...] "Chapman himself began well in batting but in the later matches was too prone <b>to</b> <b>lash</b> <b>out</b> at the off ball and, as the tour progressed, the Australian bowlers discovered his weakness." [...] On his captaincy, Southerton wrote: [...] "Chapman captained the side uncommonly well, improving out of all knowledge as the tour progressed." [...] Socially, Chapman enjoyed the tour; he attended many functions and events; Bill Ferguson, the team scorer, only saw him annoyed once on the tour: when his accustomed drink was not waiting for him at a lunch interval.|$|E

500|$|Disenchanted {{with the}} {{unfulfilled}} {{promise of the}} NSDAP to eliminate Jews from German society, SA members were eager <b>to</b> <b>lash</b> <b>out</b> against the Jewish minority {{as a way of}} expressing their frustrations. A Gestapo report from early 1935 stated that the rank and file of the NSDAP would set in motion a solution to the [...] "Jewish problem... from below that the government would then have to follow". Assaults, vandalism, and boycotts against Jews, which the Nazi government had temporarily curbed in 1934, increased again in 1935 amidst a propaganda campaign authorised {{at the highest levels of}} government. Most non-party members ignored the boycotts and objected to the violence out of concern for their own safety. The Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka argues that there was a disparity between the views of the Alte Kämpfer (longtime party members) and the general public, but that even those Germans who were not politically active favoured bringing in tougher new antisemitic laws in 1935. The matter was raised to the forefront of the state agenda as a result of this antisemitic agitation.|$|E

50|$|Cinhil's closest advisors are {{preparing}} to meet the invaders, but the king himself has become aloof and withdrawn since his ascension to the throne. He has become convinced that he sinned against God by giving up his priestly vows to become king, and he displays increasing hostility and antagonism toward Earl Camber MacRorie of Culdi, the Deryni adept most responsible for placing Cinhil on the throne. Throughout the preparations for battle and the march to the battlefield itself, Cinhil constantly clashes with the Deryni closest <b>to</b> him, <b>lashing</b> <b>out</b> angrily as his resentment toward Camber in particular and Deryni in general continues to grow. Although Cinhil seems to place slightly more trust in Alister Cullen, the Deryni Vicar General of the Michaelines, even Cullen is rebuffed when he makes overtures of friendship to the king.|$|R

5000|$|During the Sino-Japanese War, NBIS had orchestrated the assassinations {{of several}} key Japanese enemy {{military}} and government personnel. Between 1937-41, the Juntong, working {{together with the}} Green Gang triad, carried out 150 assassinations of Chinese collaborators and 40 Japanese officers in Shanghai alone. The Juntong favored assassinating Chinese collaborators over the Japanese partly because they were easier to kill as the Japanese tended to stick to certain enclaves, but mostly to prevent the Japanese from imposing any sort of ordered government in parts of China they had occupied. Japan had occupied vast sections of China inhabited by millions of people requiring {{hundreds of thousands of}} civil servants to administer while the number of Japanese who were fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese was limited, and to a very large extent the Japanese depended upon Chinese collaborators to administer China for them. Zhang Xiaolin, a leading member of the Green Gang who went over to the Japanese in 1937 was gunned down by a Juntong assassin. In October 1938, Tang Shaoyi, a former minister in Chiangs government who had agreed to serve the Japanese was killed in an antique shop when a Juntong assassin posing as a shop assistant used the antique axe he was showing to Tang to smash in his head.
