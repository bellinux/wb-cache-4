40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of an inclined tensioned, heavy cable traveling with a constant speed in the vertical plane. The cable is modeled as a beam resisting bending and shear. The governing equation for the transverse in-plane vibrations of the cable are derived through the Newton-Euler method. The cable dynamics is also studied {{in the limit of}} zero bending stiffness. In all cases, application of en- ergy balance reveals that the total energy of the system fluctuates even though the oscillations are small and bounded in time, indicating that the system is nonconser- vative. A comprehensive stability analysis is carried out in the parameter space of inclination, traveling speed, pre-tension, bending rigidity and the slenderness of the cable. Effect of damping is also considered. We conclude that, while pre-tension, rigidity and slenderness enhance the stability of the <b>traveling</b> <b>cable,</b> the angle of inclination affects the stability adversely. These results may act as guidelines for safer design and operation. Comment: 18 pages, 12 figure...|$|E
5000|$|The tower {{features}} three outside mounted [...] "Yellow Bug" [...] elevators. At {{the time}} of their construction they were the first such elevators in Canada. They were designed, engineered and maintained by a division of the Otis Elevator Company from Hamilton, Ontario and can carry passengers {{to the top of the}} tower in 52 seconds. Unlike conventional elevators that are guided by side rails, the Skylon elevators operate with a guide rail on the backside only. Special equipment is employed to prevent the cables from becoming tangled in the wind or impeded by snow and ice in the winter. A curtain wall on the outside of the tower behind each elevator protects the counterweight and <b>traveling</b> <b>cables</b> from the elements.|$|R
40|$|Traditional cable driven {{elevators}} perform {{poorly in}} high-rise buildings because {{the weight of}} the cable limits the payload, and its elasticity degrades control performance. Further, it is not mechanically possible to include several elevator cars in the same hoistway because of the cable. However such multi-car elevator systems are desirable since they reduce passenger waiting time and reduce the space requirements of the elevator system. A promising solution is to use long armature linear motors spanning the hoistway to directly drive elevator cages. In such applications, the mover position sensing method must be explicitly addressed since most active position sensing methods require <b>traveling</b> <b>cables,</b> which are also an obstacle for multi-car elevator systems. In this paper, the linear-motor active position sensing method is formally introduced and the principle of operation, design and real-time operation methods are presented. The proposed method is used to measure the position of the mover of a long armature permanent magnet linear synchronous motor requiring no active components on the mover, thus <b>traveling</b> <b>cables</b> are eliminated. The principle of operation is inspired by linear variable differential transformer: A magnetic shunt positioned at a fixed distance ahead of the mover deforms the magnetic field created by one of the armature coils. The deformation can be determined by measuring the induced voltages on the neighboring coils, and the position of the shunt, and thus the mover, can be calculated. A design method for the optimal dimensions of the shunt for a given armature to provide long measurement range and small maximum position error is presented, accompanied by a real-time measurement algorithm that will enable the motor to be driven using the method. Finally the method is verified by simulations and experimental results conducted on a full scale linear-motor elevator prototype that was constructed in the laboratory...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the design and}} operation of models I, II, and V. No report has been prepared on model III - the differences in design between it and model II were not great enough to warrant a separate report. Models IV and VI have been tested, and reports describing their features and operation are being prepared. The basic design for model I was taken from that developed by the Fisheries Research Board of Canada during an investigation with <b>traveling</b> <b>cables</b> and a chain. BCF experiments on model I indicated a need to eliminate the drag created by the screen as it returned upstream through the water. This change was accomplished in model II by raising the screen clear of the water on its return upstream. Model III, installed and tested within the Maxwell Canal (Hermiston, Oreg.) during 1966, had some improvements over model II, particularly in design of the carriage, track, and drive systems. The step from model III to IV was significant {{from the standpoint of}} design and size of structure - the carriage and track systems were drastically changed, and the screen had to be made larger and stronger to handle flows that were 10 times greater than those handled by model III. Model V represented a complete change in design and incorporated such features as a cable-suspension support structure, cantilevered screen panels to resist water forces, and replaceable panels in lieu of continuous screen belting...|$|R

During this time Sunspot is tutored by Gideon of the Externals, an old business partner of Roberto's father (who has since died). Suspecting Sunspot to be a fellow External, he takes Sunspot under his wing. Gideon ends up experimenting on Sunspot, granting him new powers such as flight {{and the ability to}} fire blasts of solar energy. For a time Sunspot becomes lost in a space-time continuum after interfering with the teleportation powers of Locus. During this time, a villain called Reignfire comes onto the scene, showing a remarkable similar appearance to Sunspot.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{simulation}} of dynamics of elevator systems {{is important in}} addressing challenges {{in the design of}} elevators. This dissertation is dedicated to the methodologies and applications of the numerical {{simulation of}} the dynamics of elevator cable-car systems, pulley-cable systems, and <b>traveling</b> and compensation <b>cables.</b> A new spatial discretization and substructure method is developed to calculate the dynamic responses of one-dimensional systems, which consist of length-variant distributed-parameter components such as strings, rods, and beams, and lumped-parameter components such as point masses and rigid bodies. This methodology is used to study the longitudinal, transverse, and their coupled dynamics of moving elevator cable-car systems. There are complicated matching conditions between the cable and the car, which cannot be satisfied in traditional methods, but can be satisfied in the current method. Hence not only the displacements, but also the internal forces/moment, such as the axial force, the bending moment, and the shear force, which are related to the spatial derivatives of the longitudinal or transverse displacement, are accurately calculated. The longitudinal-transverse coupled vibrations of a moving cable-car system are also studied using this method, and the results are compared with those from the linear models. While the result from the linear model for the transverse vibration agrees well with that from the nonlinear coupled model, the axial force calculated from the linear model can significantly differ from that from the nonlinear model when the car approaches the top of the hoist way. It is found that a large slope in the transverse vibration can significantly increase the vibratory tension in the cable, and attenuate the safety of the system. These results can be explained by theoretical analysis and verified by the absolute nodal coordinate formulation. The methodology is also used in conjunction with a simple belt creep model to study the dynamics of pulley-cable systems. A nonlinear, planar model of a slack cable with bending stiffness and arbitrarily moving ends is developed, using the slope angle of the centroid line of the cable to describe the motion of the cable, and is applied to elevator <b>traveling</b> and compensation <b>cables.</b> It is found that a vertical motion of the car can introduce a horizontal vibration of a <b>traveling</b> or compensation <b>cable.</b> This model is more efficient than the finite element models as it uses a much smaller number of elements to reach the same accuracy. Moreover, based on the asymptotic analysis of this model, a computationally efficient, linear model is developed for calculating the natural frequencies, mode shapes, and dynamic responses of stationary elevator <b>traveling</b> and compensation <b>cables.</b> The linear cable model consists of two vertical cable segments connected by a half circular loop at the bottom. There is a good agreement between the predictions from the linear and nonlinear models and between the measured natural frequencies from a full-scale experiment and the corresponding calculated ones...|$|R

Chloé says his name, making him pause once more, and she cuts his neck with the knife. Though she has an opening to kill him, a {{flashback}} to her dead patient makes her realize that she cannot do it. Leaving him to die, Chloé escapes to the cable and in tearful joy begins the descent to safety. However, she leaves her knife behind, and Anton takes it up {{and goes to the}} cable in a fit of rage.

The film ends with the note that only Loïc's body was found; Fred, Karine, Guillaume and Chloé remain missing, and a boy named Anton, kidnapped at the age of five, also remains missing: countless people go missing in the Balkans every year.|$|R
40|$|As is {{the case}} with many other {{manufacturers}} of vehicles, Volvo Construction Equipment has a constantly increasing amount of electric and electronic equipment in their articulated haulers. These are of great use in modern machines, bringing functions, and safety that were not possible before, but they also bring more cables to handle. In the case of the articulated haulers a quite thick cable harness of about 15 meters in length reaches from the driver’s cabin in the front to the components in the far back end of the vehicle. This is not only a lot of long cables to handle both during assembly and service, but the nature of signals <b>traveling</b> in <b>cables</b> is that the voltage gets weaker with distance. This phenomenon has to be accounted for by measuring devices dependent on the voltage. It has been suggested that a device referred to as an intelligent node, or ICCS-module, which communicates digitally via CAN could be installed {{in the back of the}} articulated haulers. This module would be independent of the mentioned drop in voltage. The ICCS-module will be receiving a small bundle of cables being routed from the driver’s cabin. From it cables would go out to a majority of the components in its vicinity. The components connected to the node would not need to have any other cables. This thesis is focused on the mechanical aspects of installing this ICCS-module. Having electric and electronic equipment on construction vehicles is a challenge when it comes to protecting the device from the harsh environment that is the hauler’s exterior. It will have to withstand being immersed in water for long periods of time, greatly varying temperatures, vibrations and shocks as well as being hit by projectiles. The placement as well as the design of the enclosure should be chosen with respect to both the devices length of life and how well it fulfils its intended role and achieves the expected results. To produce an enclosure and find a placement aiming to satisfy these conditions, a traditional product development process were executed. The articulated haulers as well as relevant literature were researched. Concepts were generated and evaluated by both the author and by employees at Volvo Construction Equipment until a final concept for the enclosure and placement were found. The enclosure were then designed in detail specifying the material, manufacturing techniques, controlled for thermodynamic circumstances, modelled in Catia V 5 and controlled for vibrations. It was concluded that the enclosure should be able protect the ICCS-module after some more development and that the placement and cable routing results in a much shorter total cable length...|$|R
