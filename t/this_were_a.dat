Rock 'n' Roll Circus became Hamasaki's third two-album set alongside Love Songs (2010) to be released in a single year; Hamasaki's first and second two album sets to do <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>A</b> Song for ×× and Loveppears in 1999, and (Miss)understood and Secret in 2006. To date, it remains Hamasaki's last two-album release in a single year.|$|E

500|$|During the Australian counterattack, the {{advancing}} troops {{found evidence that}} the Japanese had committed a number of war crimes at Milne Bay, specifically the execution of prisoners of war (POWs) and civilians. None of the 36 Australian troops who were captured by the Japanese survived; {{a number of them}} were found to have been executed with some showing signs of having been mutilated as well. In addition, at least 59 civilians were also murdered between 25 August and 6 September; included in <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> number of Papuan women who were sexually assaulted before being killed. The war crimes committed at Milne Bay hardened Australian soldiers' attitudes towards Japanese troops {{for the remainder of the}} war. Historian Mark Johnston has written that [...] "the Australians' relentless killing of Japanese then and thereafter owed much to a determination both to retaliate in kind and to take revenge for Japanese atrocities and rumoured maltreatment of POWs".|$|E

[...] Chris Willman from Yahoo! compared the song to Gaga's [...] "Telephone", where Knowles appears as a featured artist, and wrote that [...] "Maybe it's because the lack of a video for Gaga's [...] "Telephone" [...] leaves more to the imagination, but if <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> contest, I'd have to say her tune trumps Beyoncé's.

500|$|The UK {{government}} {{and the international community}} ultimately declared the February 1980 general election free and fair, though many observers attested to widespread political violence and intimidation of voters, particularly by ZANU (which added Patriotic Front to its name to become [...] "ZANU–PF"). British monitors in the ZANU–PF-dominated eastern provinces were strongly critical, reporting [...] "brutal 'disciplinary murders' as examples of the fate awaiting those who failed to conform", name-taking and [...] "claims to the possession of machines which would reveal how individuals had voted". The Commonwealth Observer Group acknowledged that irregularities were occurring but ruled that accounts were exaggerated. After the RF won all 20 white seats, Soames announced late on 4 March 1980 that Mugabe and ZANU–PF had won 57 of the 80 common roll seats, giving them a majority in the new House of Assembly. Mugabe invited Smith to his house that evening and according to Smith treated him [...] "most courteously"; Mugabe expressed joy at inheriting a [...] "wonderful country" [...] with modern infrastructure and a viable economy, outlined plans for gradual reform that Smith found reasonable, and said that he hoped to stay in regular contact. This meeting {{had a profound effect on}} the former Prime Minister. Having denounced Mugabe as an [...] "apostle of Satan" [...] before the election, Smith now publicly endorsed him as [...] "sober and responsible". [...] "If <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> true picture, then there could be hope instead of despair," [...] he recalled in his autobiography.

If <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> limiting factor, there could be impacts on Canadian crude oil prices, constraining future production growth. Another {{assumption is that}} US markets will continue to absorb increased Canadian exports. Rapid growth of tight oil production in the US, Canada's primary oil export market, has greatly reduced US reliance on imported crude. The potential for Canadian oil exports to alternative markets such as Asia is also uncertain. There are increasing political obstacles to building any new pipelines to deliver oil in Canada and the US. In November 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama rejected the proposal to build the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska.|$|E
2500|$|Like all {{architectural}} styles the Neo-Renaissance did {{not appear}} overnight fully formed but evolved slowly. One {{of the very first}} signs of its emergence was the Würzburg Women's Prison, which was erected in 1809 designed by Peter Speeth. It included a heavily rusticated ground floor, alleviated by one semicircular arch, with a curious Egyptian style miniature portico above, high above <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> sequence of six tall arched windows and above these just beneath the slightly projecting roof were the small windows of the upper floor. This building foreshadows similar effects {{in the work of the}} American architect Henry Hobson Richardson whose work in the Neo-Renaissance style was popular in the USA during the 1880s. Richardson's style at the end or the revival era was a severe mix of both Romanesque and Renaissance features. This was exemplified by his [...] "Marshall Field Warehouse" [...] in Chicago (completed in 1887, now demolished).|$|E

2500|$|The Reformation, {{carried out}} in Scotland in the mid-sixteenth century and heavily {{influenced}} by Calvinism, amounted to a revolution in religious practice. It led to the abolition of auricular confession, the wafer in mass, which was no longer seen as a [...] "work", Latin in services, prayers to Mary and the Saints and the doctrine of Purgatory. The interiors of churches were transformed, with {{the removal of the}} High Altar, altar rails, rood screens, choir stalls, side altars, statues and images of the saints. The colourful paintwork of the late Middle Ages was removed, with walls whitewashed to conceal murals. In place of all <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> plain table for communion, pews for the congregation, pulpits and lecterns for the sermons that were now the focus of worship. Printed sermons indicate that they could be as long as three hours. Until the 1590s most parishes were not served by a minister, but by readers, who could not preach or administer the sacraments. As a result, they might only hear a sermon once every two weeks and communion was usually administered once a year on Easter Sunday.|$|E

[...] In his review for Entertainment Weekly, critic Owen Gleiberman gave the film an F grade and wrote, [...] "George Lucas is turning into the enemy of fun." [...] Carrie Rickey, of The Philadelphia Inquirer, said, [...] "The best that can be said about the movie is that it's harmless and mostly charmless. The Clone Wars is to Star Wars what karaoke is to pop music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Martha J. Cutter {{discusses}} how {{in many of}} Charlotte Perkins Gilman's works she addresses this [...] "struggle {{in which}} a male-dominated medical establishment attempts to silence women." [...] Gilman's works challenge {{the social construction of}} women in patriarchal medical discourse by displaying women as [...] "silent, powerless, and passive" [...] who refuse treatment. At the time in which her works take place, between 1840 and 1890, women were exceedingly defined as lesser than—sickly and weak. In this time period it was thought that [...] "hysteria" [...] (a disease stereotypically more common in women) was a result of too much education. It was understood that women who spent time in college or studying were over-stimulating their brains and consequently leading themselves into states of hysteria. In fact, many of the diseases recognized in women were seen {{as the result of a}} lack of self-control or self-rule. Different physicians argued that a physician must [...] "assume a tone of authority" [...] and that the idea of a [...] "cured" [...] woman is one who is [...] "subdued, docile, silent, and above all subject to the will and voice of the physician". A hysterical woman is one who craves power and in order for her to be treated for her hysteria, she must submit to her physician whose role is to undermine her desires. Often women were prescribed bed rest as a form of treatment, which was meant to [...] "tame" [...] them and basically keep them imprisoned. Treatments such as <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> way of ridding women of rebelliousness and forcing them to conform to social roles. In her works Gilman highlights that the harm caused by these types of treatments for woman i.e. [...] "the rest cure" [...] has to do with the way in which her voice is silenced. Paula Treichler explains [...] "In this story diagnosis 'is powerful and public[...] [...] [...] It is a male voice that [...] [...] [...] imposes controls on the female narrator and dictates how she is to perceive and talk about the world.' Diagnosis covertly functions to empower the male physician's voice and disempower the female patient's". The narrator in [...] "The Yellow Wallpaper" [...] is not allowed to participate in her own treatment or diagnosis and is completely forced to succumb to everything in which her doctor and in this particular story, her husband, says. The male voice is the one in which forces controls on the female and decides how she is allowed to perceive and speak about the world around her.|$|E
