5|$|A 2006 study {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> tail length and body size in males, wing length in females, and lifespan for both sexes {{were signs of}} individual quality, and the wrens of high quality tend to mate with like individuals. The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and life experience are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle. Due to the large size of male wrens and the male's vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a {{possible explanation for the}} sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} experiment {{carried out}} by Wu was the confirmation of the E. M. L.

Wu later conducted research into the molecular changes in the deformation of hemoglobins that cause sickle-cell disease. She also did research on magnetism, and on the Mössbauer effect during the 1960s. She wrote a textbook with , Beta Decay, which was published in 1966, and became a standard reference on the subject.|$|E
50|$|In {{probability}} and statistics, {{the term}} cross-correlations {{is used for}} referring to <b>the</b> <b>correlations</b> between <b>the</b> entries <b>of</b> two random vectors X and Y, while <b>the</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>of</b> a random vector X {{are considered to be}} <b>the</b> <b>correlations</b> between <b>the</b> entries <b>of</b> X itself, those forming <b>the</b> <b>correlation</b> matrix (matrix <b>of</b> <b>correlations)</b> <b>of</b> X.

Through {{collecting}} real liquefaction in-situ {{data available}} worldwide, <b>the</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>of</b> influencing characteristics parameters such as PGA, water table depth, buried depth of sandy layer, SPT counts and {{shear wave velocity}} with respect to liquefaction were analyzed by means <b>of</b> Pearson <b>correlation</b> method. <b>The</b> correlative performance of the characteristic parameters with liquefaction was comparatively analyzed under conditions of varying buried depths, water tables and seismic intensities. <b>The</b> real <b>correlations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characteristic parameters with liquefaction were obtained corresponding to real dynamic loading, real buried condition and in-situ testing data. The analytical results show that water table, buried depth of sandy layer, SPT and shear wave velocity keep negative correlations with respect to liquefaction while <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> PGA with liquefaction was positive. <b>The</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>of</b> buried depth of sandy layer, SPT were remarkable while <b>the</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>of</b> water table, shear wave velocity were weak. <b>The</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient <b>of</b> SPT was the largest, followed by buried depth of sandy layer, PGA and water table; and <b>the</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient <b>of</b> shear wave velocity was the smallest.

The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the Universe was extremely hot and dense and that it subsequently expanded. The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space.

25|$|There {{is still}} {{debate about the}} causes of all mass extinctions. In general, large extinctions may result when a {{biosphere}} under long-term stress undergoes a short-term shock.

40|$|Computing the {{similarity}} between unstructured records is a fundamental function in multiple applications. Approximate string matching and full text retrieval techniques do not show the best performance when applied directly, since the information are limited in unstructured records of short record length.

Rather than simply conducting the exact matching tokens of two records, our similarity evaluation enriches the information of records by considering <b>the</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>of</b> tokens. We define <b>the</b> probabilistic <b>correlation</b> between tokens as the probability that these tokens appear in the same records.

25|$|There is a {{correlation}} between the geographic distribution of UV radiation (UVR) {{and the distribution of}} skin pigmentation around the world. Areas that have higher amounts of UVR have darker-skinned populations, generally located nearer the equator. Areas that are further away from the equator generally closer to the poles have a lower concentration of UVR, and contain lighter-skinned populations. This is the result of human evolution which contributed to variable melanin content in the skin to adapt to certain environments. A larger percentage of dark skinned people are found in the Southern Hemisphere because latitudinal land mass distribution is disproportionate. The present distribution of skin colour variation does not completely reflect <b>the</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> intense UVR and dark skin pigmentation due to mass migration and movement of peoples across continents in the recent past.|$|E
