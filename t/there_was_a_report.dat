Sebelius called for issuing certificates of indebtedness, moving funds from various state agency accounts into the general fund to alleviate the crisis. However, Republican leaders in the legislature did not agree with her certificate of indebtedness plan, saying the state would be unable to repay the certificates unless Sebelius issued allotments or signed a budget rescission bill that had been passed by the legislature but had not yet been delivered to her desk. The standoff ended when the budget arrived, and Sebelius agreed to sign it, although she line-item vetoed several cuts she felt were too large. The rescission bill reduced the budget by about $300 million. $7 million of the cuts came in the form of reduced educational funding.|$|E

500|$|After the 1916 {{football}} season ended, Maulbetsch considered his options. [...] <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> {{that he had}} been engaged as a high school football coach (and math instructor) in Toledo, Ohio. [...] Even more prevalent were reports that he had signed to play for a professional football team. [...] Professional football was still in its infancy in 1917, and landing a well-known star would have been a boost to any of the budding franchises. [...] In January 1917 newspapers reported that Maulbetsch had signed a contract to play professional football for Detroit Tigers owner, Frank Navin. [...] Navin was supporting efforts to organize a professional football league in all the important Midwestern cities, including a Detroit franchise to play at Navin Field. [...] As late as November 1917, newspapers reported Maulbetsch had played professional football after graduating and was offered [...] "a handsome fee" [...] to play with the Akron Burkhardts in November 1917. [...] Although professional football records prior to 1920 are scarce, it appears unlikely that Maulbetsch played professional football, as press accounts show he was working as a college football coach starting in 1917.|$|E

Would you be interested in trying to do some research to show whether she was doing something that might actually have been helpful to these patients? She probably thought that it was helpful since, you know, she was permitted on the ward to do this.
