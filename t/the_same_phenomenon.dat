5|$|Mitchell becomes {{increasingly}} arrogant and hostile toward {{the rest of}} the crew, declaring that he has become godlike, enforcing his desires with fearsome displays of telepathic and telekinetic power. Science Officer Spock (Leonard Nimoy) comes to believe that Valiant crew members may have experienced <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> and destroyed the ship to keep the power from spreading. He advises Kirk that Mitchell may have to be killed before his powers develop further, but Kirk angrily disagrees.|$|E
5|$|This {{article is}} about signal {{reflections}} on electrically conducting lines. Such lines are loosely {{referred to as}} copper lines, and indeed, in telecommunications are generally made from copper, but other metals are used, notably aluminium in power lines. Although this article is limited to describing reflections on conducting lines, this is essentially <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomenon</b> as optical reflections in fibre-optic lines and microwave reflections in waveguides.|$|E
5|$|In {{pictures}} {{taken by the}} Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, the motion of M87's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light. This motion is presumably an optical illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet, and not true superluminal motion. However, detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It has been proposed M87 could actually be a BL Lacertae object (with a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from an unfavorable angle to appreciate the properties {{of that kind of}} galaxy.|$|E

5|$|About 1.22million years ago, the San Joaquin Hills {{along the}} Orange County coast began their uplift along a blind thrust fault (the San Joaquin Hills blind thrust) {{extending}} south from the Los Angeles Basin. As Aliso Creek was an antecedent stream, {{or one that}} had formed prior to the mountains' uplift, it cut a water gap through the rising mountains that today is Aliso Canyon. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomenon</b> occurred to the north with Laguna Canyon and San Diego Creek, and to the south at San Juan Creek. The uplift also caused Aliso Creek's largest tributary, Sulphur Creek, to turn north to join Aliso Creek instead of flowing south to Salt Creek. The Wisconsinian era was responsible for shaping the watershed to its present-day form, with deep side canyons and broad alluvial valleys.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{could be}} seen in some coins from York in the tenth century where king is transliterated as CVNVNC but {{translated}} as KONUNGR (in English: KONUNGR). Old Norse in coin inscriptions ended after the tenth century.|$|E
25|$|In Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore, the Malay {{language}} is now generally {{written in the}} Latin script. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomenon</b> is present in Indonesian, although different spelling standards are utilised (e.g. 'Teksi' in Malay and 'Taksi' in Indonesian for the word 'Taxi').|$|E

25|$|If {{explicit}} possessors {{are absent}} (as in (11b) and (12b)), the phrase is ungrammatical. In (11), the possessor ni {{is necessary for}} the inalienable noun nik (arm). In (12), <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomenon</b> is found with the inalienable noun ookmis (grandmother), which needs the possessor morpheme n to be grammatical.|$|E
25|$|In a {{dispersive}} medium, {{the speed}} of sound is a function of sound frequency, through the dispersion relation. Each frequency component propagates at its own speed, called the phase velocity, while the energy of the disturbance propagates at the group velocity. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomenon</b> occurs with light waves; see optical dispersion for a description.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{results in}} {{extremely}} fast spin of compact stars (like white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes) {{when they are}} formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars.

25|$|Taken together, these morphometric studies {{strongly}} {{support the notion}} that brain plasticity—changes of brain structure—remains possible throughout life and may well be an adaptation to changes in brain function which has also been shown to change with experience. The title of this section was meant to emphasize this, namely that plasticity and learning provide two perspectives—functional and structural—at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> a brain that changes over time.|$|E
25|$|The phylogenetic {{origin of}} the flu virus that caused the 2009 pandemics can be traced before 1918. Around 1918, the ancestral virus, of avian origin, crossed the species {{boundaries}} and infected humans as human H1N1. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomenon</b> took place soon after in America, where the human virus was infecting pigs; {{it led to the}} emergence of the H1N1 swine strain, which later became the classic swine flu.|$|E
25|$|The close {{connection}} between the interpretationalist hypothesis and a holistic conception of beliefs {{is at the root}} of the notion of the dependence of perception on theory, a central concept in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Kuhn maintained that the perception of the world depends on how the percipient conceives the world: two scientists who witness <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomenon</b> and are steeped in two radically different theories will see two different things. According to this view, our interpretation of the world determines what we see.|$|E

25|$|Stace {{argues that}} doctrinal {{differences}} between religious traditions are inappropriate criteria when making cross-cultural comparisons of mystical experiences. Stace argues that mysticism {{is part of}} the process of perception, not interpretation, that is to say that the unity of mystical experiences is perceived, and only afterwards interpreted according to the perceiver’s background. This may result in different accounts of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> While an atheist describes the unity as “freed from empirical filling”, a religious person might describe it as “God” or “the Divine”.|$|E
25|$|Later {{on in his}} life, in 1862, Faraday used a {{spectroscope}} {{to search}} for a different alteration of light, the change of spectral lines by an applied magnetic field. The equipment available to him was, however, insufficient for a definite determination of spectral change. Pieter Zeeman later used an improved apparatus to study <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> publishing his results in 1897 and receiving the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics for his success. In both his 1897 paper and his Nobel acceptance speech, Zeeman made reference to Faraday's work.|$|E
25|$|Ants are {{a serious}} enemy to M. drewseni {{and there have}} been many cases of ants {{completely}} decimating a nest, destroying all of the eggs and consuming all of the nest’s nectar. After the ants destroy the nest, many adult wasps may stay nearby but never re-enter the nest. This form of attack is common and many other Mischocyttarus species are victims of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> In observations of nests, other unidentified predators have attacked the nests at night, taking bites out of the nest, sometimes wiping out entire combs, leaving just the stem. While the brood is usually the target of predation, spiders sometimes prey on adult M. drewseni. If the nest is stripped of brood or abandoned, there is evidence that other wasp species (Polistes versicolor) will rear their brood in the empty M. drewseni nests.|$|E

Therefore, its homologous maltooligosaccharides shared <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomena.</b> Cyt c-Mal complexes observed in ESI–MS reflected the corresponding species present in solution.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: It is {{hypothesized}} that planetary nebulae are <b>the</b> exact <b>same</b> <b>phenomena</b> as supernovae. It is believed {{by the mainstream}} that supernovae and planetary nebulae are completely separate phenomena. [1] This is contradictory to observational evidence as illustrated in the diagram below. [2][3][5] Both have white dwarf stars in their centers, [4][5] have an expanding outer shell of gas and dust, have coherent spherical shape caused by plasma (which is evidence of electrical currents in outer space) and are roughly 2 light years in diameter. The only thing different is what mainstream calls them. Planetary nebulae and supernova remnants are exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomena.</b> Reference...|$|R
25|$|During {{periods of}} large {{migration}} in Australia, {{and with the}} possible help of strong winds, the Australian painted lady migrates across the sea to New Zealand. Multiple occurrences of this butterfly in New Zealand were reported in the 1960s. In the spring of 1968, they appeared on the western coast of New Zealand near the sea, and were unusually abundant. The species {{is unlikely to be}} established in New Zealand, as no instances of larvae or adults hibernating through the winter were found. Although some individuals reproduced and laid eggs, the larvae only developed to the first instar before development stopped. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomenon</b> occurred in the late summer 1969, and coincided with a gale-force westerly wind. This evidence suggests that the butterflies observed in the spring of 1968 and the summer of 1969 were the result of a new migration from Australia, and not the offspring of a generation of previously migrated painted ladies. The migration of butterflies and moths from Australia is not uncommon in summers with strong winds.|$|E
25|$|In recent decades, a {{significant}} number of Anioma indigenes have grown resentful towards the wider Igbo community and questioned {{whether or not they are}} “truly” Igbo, with many histories of Anioma towns being allegedly re-written to showcase a non-Igbo wave of migration and ethno-linguistic background. Many claim descent from the ancient Benin Kingdom, a movement which has been garnering more and more support following the stigmatisation that followed the Nigerian Civil War. Introspection of the Igbo denial in Delta State, however, may generally reveal that it is strongest in the Ndokwa and Ika territories and weakest among the Enuani, the latter of whom inhabit the Aniocha and Oshimili local government areas. Many theories have been postulated to explain this occurrence. Of particular interest, it has been suggested that the Ika were an aboriginal Igbo clan, with later migrations of settlers from the Benin Kingdom, owing to close proximity. The absorption of Edoid-speaking ethnic groups into Ika territory may have resulted in the attendant strong influence on the aborigines, in cultural and linguistic terms, providing fertile soil for Igbo denial. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>phenomenon</b> may apply to the Ukwuani but, by virtue of less proximity with Edo State, to a lesser extent. Although many Ika and Ukwuani people maintain distinct cultural identities, they yet speak Igbo languages. The term Igbo itself has been conceived by many as a linguistic classification, encompassing all bia-speaking clans and with ethnic identity falling secondary to linguistic designation. As earlier mentioned, they are officially recognised as distinct ethnic groups from the Igbo.|$|E
