40|$|ABSTRACT: Recently, CT (CAT) {{scanning}} {{technology has been}} utilized to analyze snow and ice samples. To facilitate applying this technology to natural snow, a procedure has been developed that allows snow specimens to be transported from an outdoor location to the laboratory {{for the purpose of}} CT imaging. A snow sample is first obtained in a <b>tubular</b> <b>container.</b> A screen is placed beneath the container, and dimethyl phthalate cooled to a temperature just below O°C is slowly poured {{in the top of the}} snow. The wetting front moves downward, filling the pore space and expelling air out the base of the specimen. Packing the sample in dry ice freezes the substance in the pore space, protecting the snow microstructure and prohibiting metamorphism during transportation. The methodology presented is intended for CT imaging, which offers a nondestructive means to investigate grain structure and intergranular bonding, but is also applicable to surface sectioning. CT scans demonstrate that this technique provides adequate penetration of the dimethyl phthalate into the interstitial pores to prevent structural damage or metamorphism of the snow. Differences in X-ray absorption provide distinction between the ice grains and the dimethyl phthalate filled pore space...|$|E

The object of this work was to examine and research various cooling concepts and methods to reduce heat loss to engine coolant, improve thermal efficiency and to predict heat transfer values for these alternatives. The optimum system to be considered for possible application to small rural stationary engines. A literature survey was undertaken, covering work performed in the field of internal combustion engine cooling. Besides the conventional cooling system, two concepts emerged for consideration. These were the precision cooling system and the new heat pipe concept, the latter being relatively unknown for internal combustion cooling application. The precision cooling system, consists of a series of small bore tubes conducting coolant only to the critical areas of an engine. The theory being that in the conventional systems many regions are overcooled, resulting in excessive heat loss. The heat pipe is a device of very high thermal conductance and normally consists of a sealed tube containing a small quantity of fluid. Under operating conditions the <b>tubular</b> <b>container</b> becomes an evaporator region in the heat input area and a condenser region in the heat-out area. It is therefore basically a thermal flux transformer,attached to the object to be cooled. The heat pipe performance is also capable of being modulated by varying its system pressure. This is a positive feature for internal combustion engine application in controlling detonation and NOx emissions. Various facts were obtained from the literature survey and considered in the theoretical review. These facts were extended into models, predicting the heat transfer performance of each concept in terms of coolant heat outflow and heat transfer coefficients. The experimental apparatus was based on an automotive cylinder head with heated oil passing through the combustion chamber and exhaust port to simulate combustion gases. Experiments were conducted on this apparatus to validate the predicted theoretical performance of the three concepts. Tests were also made to observe the effect of heat pipe modulation and nucleate boiling in the precision system. Concept theory was validated as shown by the experimental and test results. The performance for each system approximated the predicted heat transfer and heat loss values. By comparison of the heat input, coolant heat outflow values and heat transfer coefficients {{it was found that the}} precision system was the most efficient, followed by the heat pipe and the conventional system being the least efficient. It was concluded that the heat loss tests provided a valuable insight into the heat transfer phenomenon as applied to the three systems investigated. This work also illustrated the effects of the variation of coolant flow, velocity and influence of nucleate boiling. This thesis has shown the potential of the systems tested, for controlling heat losses in internal combustion engines. The research work has created a data base for further in-depth evaluation and development of the heat pipe and the precision cooling system. Based on the findings of the experimental work done on this project, several commercial applications exist for the heat pipe and precision cooling systems. Further in-depth research is recommended to extend their potential in the automotive industry...|$|E

50|$|Switches, circuit breakers, {{transformers}} {{and other}} apparatus may be interconnected by air-insulated bare conductors strung on support structures. The air space required increases with system voltage {{and with the}} lightning surge voltage rating. For medium-voltage distribution substations, metal-enclosed switch gear may be used and no live conductors exposed at all. For higher voltages, gas-insulated switch gear reduces the space required around live bus. Instead of bare conductors, bus and apparatus are built into pressurized <b>tubular</b> <b>containers</b> filled with sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas. This gas has a higher insulating value than air, allowing {{the dimensions of the}} apparatus to be reduced. In addition to air or SF6 gas, apparatus will use other insulation materials such as transformer oil, paper, porcelain, and polymer insulators.|$|R

50|$|Pods, {{also known}} as guppies or simply tubes, are simply rigid <b>tubular</b> plastic <b>containers</b> which hold paintballs. The most common pod size holds about 140 paintballs; however, other sizes are available, and 100 paintball pods are common at rental sites, while there are also pods for smaller paintball pistols which only have the {{capacity}} of 10 paintballs (such pods are usually called tubes). Standard pods use a spring-loaded plastic top {{to enable them to}} be opened quickly and single-handedly. There are variations - for example, Dye Lock Lid pods which use a simple locking mechanism to ensure they won't open accidentally, or Syn Shockpods, which are engineered {{to be able to be}} shaken vigorously without the paint inside breaking. The oldest and largest manufacturer of pods is Allen Paintball Products in Ohio USA, they have been making paintball products since 1987.|$|R
