5|$|According to Lafcadio Hearn, a {{butterfly}} {{was seen in}} Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters your guest room and perches behind <b>the</b> <b>bamboo</b> screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened— thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{believed}} that the Cheraw dance originated {{as early as the}} 1st century AD. Long bamboo staves are used for this dance, therefore many people call it [...] "Bamboo Dance". Aptly supported by two bases, <b>the</b> <b>bamboos</b> are clapped together on a particular beat by the male dancers. The females who have a perfect sense of timing, dance gracefully by stepping {{in and out of the}} crossed and horizontally laid <b>bamboo</b> staves. <b>The</b> dancers move by stepping alternatively in and out from between and across a pair of horizontal <b>bamboos,</b> held against <b>the</b> ground by people sitting face to face on either side. They tap <b>the</b> <b>bamboos</b> in rhythmic beats. <b>The</b> <b>bamboos,</b> placed horizontally, are supported by two bases, one at each end. <b>The</b> <b>bamboos,</b> when clapped, produce a sound which forms the rhythm of the dance. It indicates the timing of the dance as well. The dancers steps in and out to the beats of <b>the</b> <b>bamboos</b> with ease and grace.|$|R

5|$|Classifications in {{the first}} half of the 20th century divided lemurs into three families: Daubentoniidae, Indriidae, and Lemuridae, with the latter {{including}} the current Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae. Because of concerns that Lemuridae might not be monophyletic, the family was later split; in 1982 Tattersall separated the Cheirogaleidae for the dwarf lemurs, mouse lemurs and relatives, and the Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and bamboo lemurs (including the greater bamboo lemur). This classification is still used, except that <b>the</b> <b>bamboo</b> lemurs were moved back to Lemuridae.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the aim {{to make use of}} {{renewable}} resources, the furniture in Poh Ern Shih for its resident monastics is made from bamboo. Bamboo is considered {{to one of the most}} ecologically friendly materials for use in home furnishing and flooring, because it can be harvested without felling the entire tree. There is therefore no need for replanting, and <b>the</b> <b>bamboo</b> is allowed to regain its full height again over about five years, ready to be harvested again.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{works of}} Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'yōshū poetry anthology, {{all from the}} 8th century and written in Chinese characters. In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (Hiragana and Katakana) was developed. The Tale of <b>the</b> <b>Bamboo</b> Cutter is considered the oldest Japanese narrative.

5|$|The {{investigation}} into the fire made a preliminary conclusion that negligence by unlicensed welders on the tenth floor caused <b>the</b> <b>bamboo</b> scaffolding and attached nylon netting to catch fire, which subsequently spread to the entire structure. Shanghai authorities detained eight individuals on 16 November, at least four of whom were accused of being unlicensed welders. As of 19 November, a total of twelve individuals were being held by officials in connection to the blaze, including four more who were detained that day. The four were representatives of Jiayi Building Decoration, a part of renovation contractor Jing'an Construction, Shanghai Jing'an Construction Supervision, and the apartment management company.|$|E

5|$|Antbirds {{are mostly}} birds of humid lowland rainforests. Few species are found at higher elevations, {{with less than}} 10% of species having ranges above 2000 m (6500ft) and almost none with ranges above 3000 m (10000ft). The highest species {{diversity}} {{is found in the}} Amazon basin, with up to 45 species being found in single locations in sites across Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. The number of species drops dramatically towards the further reaches of the family's range; there are only seven species in Mexico, for example. Areas of lower thamnophilid diversity may contain localised endemics, however. The Yapacana antbird, for example, is restricted to the stunted woodlands that grow in areas of nutrient-poor white-sand soil (the so-called Amazonian caatinga) in Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia. Some species are predominantly associated with microhabitats within a greater ecosystem; for example, <b>the</b> <b>bamboo</b> antshrike is predominantly found in bamboo patches.|$|E
5|$|From the 1970s to the 1990s, {{there have}} been {{suggestions}} that the ruffed lemurs {{might be related to}} indriids or a sister group to Lemuridae and Indriidae and that <b>the</b> <b>bamboo</b> lemurs are related to the sportive lemurs, but neither view is supported by molecular phylogeny. The sportive lemurs and the extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapidae) both lack upper incisors in the permanent dentition, and in 1981, Groves placed both together in the family Megaladapidae, which he renamed Lepilemuridae in 2005 because that older name takes precedence. Genetic research does not support a close relationship between the sportive and koala lemurs and instead places the koala lemurs as a sister group to Lemuridae; therefore, the two are now placed in separate families (Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and Megaladapidae for the koala lemurs). The sloth lemurs (Palaeopropithecidae) and monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae) were classified as subfamilies within Indriidae as late as 1982, but are now recognized as separate families.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{habitat of}} Lac Alaotra is {{threatened}} by pollution, destruction of marshes {{for the construction of}} rice fields, overfishing, and introduced species such as exotic fish, plants, the black rat (Rattus rattus), and the small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), another small carnivoran. A bird restricted to the area, the Alaotra grebe (Tachybaptus rufolavatus), was declared extinct in 2010 and the population of <b>the</b> <b>bamboo</b> lemur fell by about 30% from 1994 to 1999. As a narrowly distributed species with a small population, S.durrelli is likely to be threatened by degradation of its habitat and perhaps competition with the small Indian civet and the black rat, but its conservation status has not yet been formally assessed. The DWCT is working to conserve the Lac Alaotra area and the region has been designated as a protected area.|$|E
5000|$|The band's third studio album, Side-Stepper, was {{released}} in 2008. The album maintained {{a higher proportion of}} vocal tracks and included several songs heavily influenced by the Northern Soul/Motown sound. The album included contributions from guest vocalists Megan Washington (Australia), Paul Macinnes (Sweden) and TY (UK). Side-Stepper featured the singles [...] "King of the Rodeo" [...] (<b>The</b> <b>Bamboos</b> first video clip) and [...] "I Can't Help Myself" [...] (Later nominated in the Blues & Roots Work of the Year category in the APRA Awards). Original band member keyboardist Ben Grayson left the band at this point and was replaced by Dustin Mclean. Upon release 'Side-Stepper' received airplay on national youth radio station Triple J, Triple R (Feature Album), PBS 106.7FM (Feature Album), and on Mark Lamarr and Craig Charles's BBC radio shows.The Sunday Age named it [...] "Album Of The Month" [...] and The Brag and Inpress 'Album Of <b>The</b> Week'. <b>The</b> <b>Bamboos</b> were included in The Ages [...] "Top 100" [...] list of influential people in Melbourne for 2008.

5|$|On September 22, 2004, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) awakens disoriented in {{the jungle}} and notices a yellow Labrador {{retriever}} (Madison) darting through <b>the</b> <b>bamboo</b> forest. Following the path it came from, Jack runs haphazardly through the jungle to a beach, where he is confronted by the carnage of the airplane crash of Oceanic Flight 815. Jack, a surgeon, administers medical aid to the survivors, assisting the pregnant Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), enlisting Hurley (Jorge Garcia) to watch her, and administering CPR to Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell), saving her life. After the initial shock passes, Jack retreats to a quiet area beyond the beach to tend to his own injuries, when he notices Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) passing through the jungle. He asks her for assistance, which she gives by helping suture a wound on his back. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) organizes a clean-up crew, while Hurley salvages meals from the plane's galley and distributes them to the survivors. Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) refuses chocolate offered by her brother Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder), believing that rescue is imminent. A Korean man, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), tells his wife, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), in Korean that she should remain close to him at all times.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{material}} {{makes up}} the majority of most lemur diets. Members of at least 109 of all known plant families in Madagascar (55%) are exploited by lemurs. Since lemurs are primarily arboreal, most of these exploited species are woody plants, including trees, shrubs, or lianas. Only the ring-tailed lemur, <b>the</b> <b>bamboo</b> lemurs (genus Hapalemur), and the black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata) are known to consume herbs. While Madagascar is rich in fern diversity, these plants are rarely eaten by lemurs. One possible {{reason for this is that}} ferns lack flowers, fruits, and seeds—common food items in lemur diets. They also occur close to the ground, while lemurs spend most of their time in the trees. Lastly, ferns have an unpleasant taste due to the high content of tannins in their fronds. Likewise, mangroves appear to be rarely exploited by lemurs due to their high tannin content. Some lemurs appear to have evolved responses against common plant defenses, however, such as tannins and alkaloids. The golden bamboo lemur (Hapalemur aureus), for instance, eats giant bamboo (Cathariostachys madagascariensis), which contains high levels of cyanide. This lemur can consume twelve times the typically lethal dose for most mammals on a daily basis; the physiological mechanisms that protect it from cyanide poisoning are unknown. At the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in the United States, lemurs that roam the outdoor enclosures have been observed eating poison ivy (Taxicodendron radicans), yet have shown no ill effects.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics who {{identify}} {{issues with the}} traditionalist view point to possible anachronisms in The Art of War including terms, technology (such as anachronistic crossbows and the unmentioned cavalry), philosophical ideas, events, and military techniques that {{should not have been}} available to Sun Wu. Additionally, there are no records of professional generals during the Spring and Autumn period; these are only extant from the Warring States period, so there is doubt as to Sun Tzu's rank and generalship. This caused much confusion as to when The Art of War was actually written. The first traditional view is that it was written in 512 BC by the historical Sun Wu, active {{in the last years of}} the Spring and Autumn period (c. 722–481 BC). A second view, held by scholars such as Samuel Griffith, places The Art of War during the middle to late Warring States period (c. 481–221 BC). Finally, a third school claims that the slips were published in the last half of the 5th century BC; this is based on how its adherents interpret <b>the</b> <b>bamboo</b> slips discovered at Yin-ch’ueh-shan in 1972 AD.|$|E
