5|$|STS-8 was {{the eighth}} NASA Space Shuttle mission {{and the third}} flight of <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Challenger.

5|$|The Shuttle fleet {{lost two}} orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: Challenger in 1986, and Columbia in 2003.

NASA's Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011.

5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a rule-based expert system {{to manage the}} operation of <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle's</b> cryogenic fuel system.

The problem of configuring the operation of <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle's</b> fuel tanks is well-bounded and well defined. Moreover, the solution of this problem can be encoded in a knowledge-based system. Therefore, a rule-based expert system is the appropriate paradigm. Furthermore, the expert system {{could be used in}} coordination with power system simulation software to design operating procedures for specific missions...|$|R
