40|$|Data {{handling}} and documentation are important issues which {{need to be}} considered in process plant design and operations. The need for comprehensive and efficient data {{handling and}} documentation control systems becomes even more pronounced as more advanced technology find new applications in plant design and projects become more ambitious and complex. The widespread use of computer-based systems means even more documentation is being generated. Creation of documents of all <b>types</b> <b>including</b> text, <b>drawings</b> and images, is faster; making alterations is convenient and many more revisions may be made. The availability of networks, local and remote, makes it feasible to circulate the documentation readily, if they are in electronic form...|$|R
5000|$|In California, {{several types}} of tankhouse can be seen today. The {{supporting}} tower may have vertical or sloping sides. The tankroom (top floor) may also have vertical or sloping sides, and {{may or may not}} overhang the tower. On many tankhouses the redwood tank is not enclosed by siding but exposed, with or without a roof above it. In some areas one type predominates. Other variants occur, particularly among those built in the 19th century. Cooper illustrates four early examples with octagonal towers. [...] Pitman <b>includes</b> <b>drawings</b> of six <b>types,</b> one of which is now rare, with the supporting structure wider than the tankroom. Manning <b>includes</b> <b>drawings</b> of five <b>types,</b> <b>including</b> the same rare type. [...] Thorsheim also illustrates five types. [...] Many tankhouses have lost the top (tank) level, making it hard to know the original design. Windmills were usually attached to the tankhouse, but sometimes were on their own tower. Most of the windmills have disappeared.|$|R

40|$|Constructivism {{remains one}} of the most {{influential}} views of understanding how children learn science today. Research investigating learning from within this viewpoint has led to the development of a range of theoretical models, most of which aim to explain the underlying processes associated with conceptual change. Such models range in depth and scope with some attributing change to purely cognitive processes while others suggest a role for social factors. Contemporary research has also begun to explore links between the role of practical activity, skills development and language. This study utilises a cross-sectional design in order to investigate the development of children’s ideas and concepts related to two areas of the English National Curriculum for Science: ‘electricity’ and ‘floating and sinking’. A new and innovative multimodal methodology combining practical science activities and traditional / conventional perspectives alongside interview and observational protocols is presented. Multimodal research proposes that knowledge and meaning are transmitted through a range of responses <b>types</b> <b>including</b> language, <b>drawings</b> and gesture. The participants in this study were children aged 7, 11 and 14 years attending four schools in the East Midlands region. Results demonstrate that the children’s ideas could be developed using conceptual challenge tasks. The gestures that the children produced were categorised according to five different forms: referential, representative, expressive, thinking and social, often containing information about their science ideas that was not included in other response types. The results also begin to uncover how meaning is socially constructed and supported. These results form the basis of a critique of methodology intended to re-evaluate and inform debate arising from different models of conceptual change. The potential importance of studying children’s gestures in classroom settings for providing important cues and clues to underlying thoughts that may not be present in verbal or other more conventional responses alone is highlighted...|$|R
