40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with guidance strategies for near-optimum performance in a windshear. The takeoff problem is considered with reference to flight in a vertical plane. In addition to the horizontal shear, {{the presence of a}} downdraft is assumed. A gamma guidance scheme, based on the absolute path inclination, is presented. This approach needs local information on the windshear and the downdraft. The gamma guidance scheme produces trajecories that preserve the basic properties of the optimal trajectories. The relation between the gamma guidance scheme and the acceleration guidance scheme is explored. In logic, these two guidance schemes are complementary to one another; in implementation, they yield almost identical results. Although local information on the windshear and the downdraft will be available in future aircraft, it might not be available on current aircraft. Hence, a simplified gamma guidance scheme (quick <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>flight)</b> is presented which is useful for flight in severe windshears. The simplified gamma guidance scheme yields trajectories that are close to the optimal trajectories in severe windshears; in addition, it is easy to implement as a practical piloting technique...|$|E

Due to the harsh environmental conditions in the stratosphere, the integration of electronic components in the airframe is a major effort.

40|$|The Naval Postgraduate School is {{developing}} an {{vertical take-off and landing}} (VTOL) unmanned air vehicle (UAV) that can <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>flight,</b> once airborne, {{in order to}} take advantage of the improvements in speed, range, and loiter time that horizontal, fixed-wing flight provides. This research investigates the design requirements of the central controlling device for that UAV, including the specific problems of defining the necessary hardware components and developing software for executive control. First, hardware requirements needed to be determined. By exploring the general operational requirements of the UAV and taking into account space and weight limitations, a hardware suite was selected which could provide adequate functionality to replace the human traits of a pilot. Its order to provide awareness' of the operational environment, motion sensors, navigation equipment, and communication equipment was required. Controllable servo motors were necessary to move control surfaces appropriately. Computer hardware, necessary to provide system intelligence, was selected in order to interoperate with the other hardware. Next, a Real-Time Executive (RTE) software program was designed to provide the functionality and coordination of all hardware components. Device drivers for each component were developed, and overall coordination was planned using a Yourdon style essential model. Periodic interrupts were used to control execution time. Last, the specifications and configuration of all hardware components were completely documented, and the operation of the RTE program is fully explained. From this understanding of the overall control system, future development can continue, resulting in a more effective and efficient UAV design. NANAU. S. Coast Guard (U. S. C. G.) author...|$|E
40|$|Surrey Space Centre (SSC) {{has been}} working on an {{autonomous}} fixed-wing all-electric vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aerobot for the exploration of Mars for several years. SSC’s previous designs have incorporated separate vertical lift and horizontal pusher rotors as well as a mono tilt-rotor configuration. The Martian aerobot’s novel Y- 4 tilt-rotor (Y 4 TR) design is a combination of two previous SSC designs and a step forward for planetary aerobots. The aerobot will fly as a Y 4 multi-rotor during vertical flight and as a conventional flying wing during horizontal flight. The more robust Y 4 TR configuration utilizes two large fixed coaxial counter rotating rotors and two small tilt-rotors for vertical takeoff. The front tilt-rotors rotate during transition flight into the main horizontal flight configuration. The aerobot is a blended wing design with the wings using the "Zagi 10 " airfoil blended to a center cover for the coaxial rotors. The open source design and analysis programs XROTOR, CROTOR, Q-BLADE, XFLR 5, and OpenVSP were used to design and model the aerobot’s four rotors and body. The baseline mission of the Y 4 TR remains the same as previously reported and will investigate the Isidis Planitia region on Mars over a month long period using optical sensors during flight and a surface science package when landed. During flight operations the aerobot will take off vertically, <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>flight,</b> fly for around an hour, transition back to vertical flight, and land vertically. The flight missions will take place close to local noon to maximize power production via solar cells during flight. A nonlinear six degree of freedom (6 DoF) dynamic model incorporating aerodynamic models of the aerobot’s body and rotors has been developed to model the vertical, transition, and horizontal phases of flight. A nonlinear State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) controller has been developed for each of these flight phases. The nonlinear dynamic model was transformed into a pseudo-linear form based on the states and implemented in the SDRE controller. During transition flight the aerobot is over actuated and the weighted least squares (WLS) method is used for allocation of control effectors. Simulations of the aerobot flying in different configurations were performed to verify the performance of the SDRE controllers, including hover, transition, horizontal flight, altitude changes, and landing scenarios. Results from the simulations show the SDRE controller is a viable option for controlling the novel Y 4 TR Martian Aerobot...|$|E

40|$|The {{technology}} of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) has developed since its conception many years ago. UAVs have several features such as, computerised and autonomous control {{without the need}} for an on-board pilot. Therefore, there is no risk of loss of life and they are easier to maintain than manned aircraft. In addition, UAVs have an extended range/endurance capability, sometimes for several days. This makes UAVs attractive for missions that are typically "dull, dirty and dangerous". With the development of technology, the application of UAVs is becoming commonplace for both military and civil missions. Examples of this are reconnaissance, surveillance, environmental monitoring, disaster observation, etc. The School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering (SAMME) at RMIT University has designed a novel concept for a ducted-fan UAV with vertical takeoff and landing capability and the option to <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>flight.</b> The aerodynamic analysis, preliminary and detailed design, of this ducted-fan VTOL UAV, is the first and most important step. To optimize the aerodynamic characteristics, evaluating aerodynamic coefficients and analyzing the flow patterns around the vehicle at different speeds and angles of attack is necessary. In this project, CFD {{plays an important role in}} predicting the longitudinal and lateral stability and control characteristics of a full-scale model of ducted fan VTOL UAV at both vertical and horizontal flight without any prior knowledge of existing wind tunnel or flight test data. Prior to carrying out experiments in the wind tunnel, the manufacture of ducted fan VTOL UAV was focused on. Particular attention was paid to the propulsion system as the key point. The full-scale model of UAV was produced using the Rapid Prototyping Facility at SAMME to ensure its accurate geometric shape for testing in the wind tunnel. The experiments of the full-scale UAV model with engines was conducted in RMIT&# 039;s Industrial Wind Tunnel where its aerodynamic characteristics and its properties of counter-rotating propulsion system were tested. In addition, the correlation between experimental data and CFD results was evaluated and the accuracy of the dynamic model of ducted fan VTOL UAV was improved. Flight dynamics is concerned with the motion of an aircraft due to internally or externally generated forces. The ducted fan VTOL UAV stability and control derivatives are determined and used as a basis in a flight simulation environment. This simulation showed that the vehicle is stable and controllable for a range of flight speeds. Finally, a MIMO linear control system was designed to control the vehicle in hovering and low-speed slide flight. The real-time simulation and modeling in MATLAB combined with a flight-simulator showed several animations and trajectories of UAV missions with or without crosswind effect during flight. These simulations were very helpful in determining the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle under various flight conditions...|$|E
