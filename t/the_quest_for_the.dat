25|$|Another {{version is}} Thomas Hardy's The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse, a one-act play which was {{published}} in 1923. Hardy and his first wife visited Tintagel on various occasions: she drew a sketch of the inside of the church as it was about 1867. Robert Stephen Hawker's poem about the bells of Forrabury refers also to those of Tintagel, but more notable is his one on <b>the</b> <b>Quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sangraal (first published at Exeter in 1864).|$|E
25|$|In {{its early}} stages, the tale was {{probably}} unrelated to contemporary Arthurian literature, but the earliest surviving versions already incorporate references to Arthur and his court. The connection between Tristan and Iseult and the Arthurian legend was expanded over time, and sometime {{shortly after the}} completion of the Vulgate Cycle (or Lancelot-Grail Cycle) {{in the first quarter of}} the 13th century, two authors created the vast Prose Tristan, which fully establishes Tristan as a Knight of the Round Table who even participates in <b>the</b> <b>Quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Holy Grail.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dorian {{invasion}} {{had begun}} {{as an attempt}} to explain the differences between Peloponnesian society depicted by Homer and the historical Dorians of classical Greece. The first scholars to work on the problem were historians researching the only resources available to them: the Greek legends. The philologists (later linguists) subsequently took up the challenge but in the end only brought the problem into sharper definition. Finally the archaeologists have inherited the issue. Perhaps some distinctively Dorian archaeological evidence will turn up or has turned up giving precise insight as to how and when Peloponnesian society changed so radically.|$|E
25|$|Greene is {{well known}} to a wider {{audience}} {{for his work on}} popularizing theoretical physics, in particular string theory and the search for a unified theory of physics. His first book, The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and <b>the</b> <b>Quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Ultimate Theory, published in 1999, is a popularization of superstring theory and M-theory. It was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction, and winner of The Aventis Prizes for Science Books in 2000. The Elegant Universe was later made into a PBS television special of the same name, hosted and narrated by Greene, which won a 2003 Peabody Award.|$|E
25|$|Ashton {{initially}} approached Sir William Walton {{to compose}} the score for Ondine. They had worked together before, on a ballet called <b>The</b> <b>Quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sadler's Wells company in 1943, {{and agreed to}} collaborate again for the 1955–56 season; they decided on Macbeth as their subject. Fonteyn, however, was firmly opposed to playing Lady Macbeth, and was not enthused by Ashton's next suggestion, Miranda in a ballet of The Tempest. By the time Ashton had lighted on Ondine as an alternative, Walton was immersed in work on a concerto. He suggested that his friend Henze be approached. Accordingly, the music was commissioned from Henze, who titled the score Undine.|$|E

The witch gives Merida a pouch of magical ale, to summon her father's spirit from the Underworld. Merida then thanked Mulan and Ruby for helping her, with Ruby and Mulan decide to team up together to find other werewolves. Merida then uses the spell at her father's grave and his spirit appears to her, telling Merida that he was proud of her. After King Fergus' spirit disappears, Merida vows to make Arthur pay.|$|E
25|$|Although Jesus {{bloodline}} {{hypotheses were}} not {{submitted to the}} judgment of the Jesus Seminar, a group of scholars involved in <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> historical Jesus from a liberal Christian perspective, they were unable to determine whether Jesus and Mary Magdalene had a matrimonial relationship due to the dearth of historical evidence. They concluded that the historical Mary Magdalene was not a repentant prostitute but a prominent disciple of Jesus and a leader in the early Christian movement. Bart D. Ehrman, who chairs the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina, commented that, although there are some historical scholars who claim that it is likely that Jesus was married, the vast majority of New Testament and early Christianity scholars find such a claim to be historically unreliable.|$|E
25|$|On October 27, 1919, the Lebanese {{delegation}} led by Maronite Patriarch Elias Peter Hoayek {{presented the}} Lebanese aspirations in a memorandum to the Paris Peace Conference. This included a significant {{extension of the}} frontiers of the Lebanon Mutasarrifate, arguing that the additional areas constituted natural parts of Lebanon, {{despite the fact that}} the Christian community would not be a clear majority in such an enlarged state. <b>The</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> annexation of agricultural lands in the Bekaa and Akkar was fueled by existential fears following the death of nearly half of the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate population in the Great Famine; the Maronite church and the secular leaders sought a state that could better provide for its people. The areas to be added to the Mutasarrifate included the coastal towns of Beirut, Tripoli, Sidon and Tyre and their respective hinterlands, all of which belonged to the Beirut Vilayet, together with four Kazas of the Syria Vilayet (Baalbek, the Bekaa, Rashaya and Hasbaya).|$|E

25|$|In 2012, the Irish Dominican {{priest and}} theologian Thomas L. Brodie (born 1943), holding a PhD from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome and a co-founder and former {{director}} of the Dominican Biblical Institute in Limerick, published Beyond <b>the</b> <b>Quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Historical Jesus: Memoir of a Discovery. In this book, Brodie, who previously had published academic works on the Hebrew prophets, argued that the Gospels are essentially a rewriting of the stories of Elijah and Elisha when viewed as a unified account in the Books of Kings. This view lead Brodie to the conclusion that Jesus is mythical. Brodie's argument builds on his previous work, in which he stated that rather than being separate and fragmented, the stories of Elijah and Elisha are united and that 1 Kings 16:29–2 Kings 13:25 is a natural extension of 1 Kings 17–2 Kings 8 which have a coherence not generally observed by other biblical scholars. Brodie then views the Elijah–Elisha story as the underlying model for the gospel narratives.|$|E
