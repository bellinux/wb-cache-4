5|$|In , Sora's group stumbles upon a {{fortress}} known as Castle Oblivion, believing {{they will find}} Mickey and Riku inside.

40|$|International audienceChronic {{alcoholism}} affects both {{episodic memory}} and metamemory for novel information. Patients were relatively unaware of <b>their</b> <b>memory</b> deficits {{and believed that}} <b>their</b> <b>memory</b> {{was as good as}} that of the healthy controls. The monitoring measure (FOK) and the subjective measure of metamemory (MIA) showed that patients with chronic alcoholism overestimated <b>their</b> <b>memory</b> capacities. Episodic memory deficit and executive dysfunction would explain metamemory decline in this clinical population...|$|R
40|$|Past {{research}} suggests that adults {{may be able to}} recognize changes in <b>their</b> <b>memory</b> over time, even though they may not be accurate at describing <b>their</b> <b>memory</b> relative to other people. Our study explored older adults 2 ̆ 7 self-perceptions of <b>their</b> <b>memory</b> compared either to their peer group or to themselves in the past and how accurately these self-perceptions reflect objective memory abilities. We randomly assigned 33 community-dwelling older adults (ages 60 to 96) to one of two conditions. In the other-comparison condition, participants completed a memory self-report questionnaire by comparing <b>their</b> <b>memory</b> to the memory of others. In the past-self condition, participants answered the same questionnaire items, but compared <b>their</b> current <b>memory</b> to <b>their</b> own <b>memory</b> in the past. Both versions of the questionnaire asked participants to rate their ability to remember everyday information, as well as their frequency of everyday memory failures. Higher scores reflected better self-perceived ability and fewer everyday memory failures. Participants then completed an objective memory test in which they studied a list of 25 non-categorizable words before freely recalling as many words as they could. Finally, participants completed a measure of depressive affect. We found that memory self-perceptions and memory complaints were affected by the specific comparison older adults were asked to make. Although the accuracy of memory self-perceptions was not influenced by item wording, older adults judged <b>their</b> <b>memory</b> more harshly when comparing <b>their</b> current <b>memory</b> to <b>their</b> past <b>memory</b> than when comparing themselves to others...|$|R

Kilo begins to remember his secret past: he learns that Denham led a Eurocorp team to kill his parents and abduct him as a baby because he has genes ideal for becoming an agent. Kilo escapes from his restraints and rescues Lily, who tells Kilo that like him, all of Eurocorp's agents were abducted as children and <b>their</b> <b>memories</b> were modified so they would remain loyal to Eurocorp.

5|$|In 1970, {{ten years}} {{prior to the start of}} the game, {{suspected}} serial killer Yō Haibara kidnapped five girls from their rooms in a sanatorium on Rougetsu, an island south of Honshu. The girls were rescued from a cavern beneath the sanatorium by detective Chōshirō Kirishima, who had been pursuing Haibara, but they had all lost <b>their</b> <b>memories.</b> Two years later, a catastrophe strikes Rougetsu Island which kills off the inhabitants. Eight years later, in the present, two of the rescued girls have died in mysterious circumstances and two of the survivors, Misaki Asō and Madoka Tsukimori, return to discover the truth about their pasts. Despite being warned by her mother not to return to the island, fellow survivor Ruka Minazuki goes there to find Misaki and Madoka. Shortly before Ruka's arrival, Madoka is killed by hostile spirits. Chōshirō, the detective who rescued them, also returns to the island to both find Ruka and continue his pursuit of Haibara. During her exploration, Ruka learns that she and Misaki are suffering from a malady known as the Hidden Moon Disease, which affects <b>their</b> <b>memories</b> and identity and is spread by touch and vision. Each character also collects pieces of a mask used in a local ritual dance to ease the passing of souls into the afterlife.

On the day of death, a cell would be taken from the sample for the cloning to take place, and the memories and personality would be restored to their peak level.|$|E

40|$|One {{problem with}} eyewitnesses is that <b>their</b> <b>memory</b> {{is not always}} accurate. False details, or misinformation, may be unintentionally {{incorporated}} into an eyewitness’s account of a crime, thereby reducing the validity of their testimony. The present study seeks to mitigate this misinformation effect by explicitly warning participants. However, instead of testing <b>their</b> <b>memory</b> with conventional laboratory memory tests, we used the more ecologically valid cognitive interview procedure. Participants were 48 college students who watched a video of a robbery, read a narrative that suggested false details about the crime, and then experienced the cognitive interview to evaluate <b>their</b> <b>memory.</b> Results indicated that eyewitnesses in the warning condition reported significantly less misleading information during the cognitive interview {{than those who were}} not warned...|$|R

5|$|The game {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2084, in a futuristic version of Paris called Neo-Paris.
