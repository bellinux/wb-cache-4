5|$|In Smith's view, the {{opportunity}} to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity; those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf. Smith said <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> died in their innocence would be guaranteed to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation. Apart from those who committed the eternal sin, Smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were randomly assigned to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
5|$|Students in Malawi have {{expressed}} {{high levels of}} dissatisfaction regarding the HIV/AIDS-related education and support they receive at school. According to a survey of students in Malawi, most secondary students {{do not believe that}} the HIV/AIDS curricula at their schools provide them with an adequate understanding of the disease. Although the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations have conducted many campaigns to improve awareness about HIV/AIDS in schools, there is still a significant shortage of age-appropriate audio and visual educational materials relating to HIV/AIDS available to instructors, particularly in rural areas. In addition, most teachers cannot identify the students in their classes who have been personally affected by the epidemic, either through friends or relatives, which suggests that school-based support for HIV/AIDS is minimal. However, despite this lack of support, surveys indicate <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> have been affected by the epidemic do not usually experience HIV/AIDS-based discrimination at school.|$|E

25|$|A key {{turning point}} for braille {{literacy}} was {{the passage of the}} Rehabilitation Act of 1973, an act of Congress that moved thousands of children from specialized schools for the blind into mainstream public schools. Because {{only a small percentage of}} public schools could afford to train and hire braille-qualified teachers, braille literacy has declined since the law took effect. Braille literacy rates have improved slightly since the bill was passed, in part because of pressure from consumers and advocacy groups that has led 27 states to pass legislation mandating <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are legally blind be given the opportunity to learn braille.|$|E
25|$|Music {{has been}} found to be an {{effective}} tool for music therapists through extensive research. It is beneficial for any individual, both physically and mentally, through improved heart rate, reduced anxiety, stimulation of the brain, and improved learning. Music therapists use their techniques to help their patients in many areas, ranging from stress relief before and after surgeries, to neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. One study found <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> listened to music while having an IV inserted into their arms showed less distress and felt less pain than the children who did not listen to music while having an IV inserted.|$|E

25|$|Children who are obese {{are likely}} to be obese as adults. Thus, they are more at risk for adult health {{problems}} such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, several types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. One study showed <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> became obese as early as age 2 {{were more likely to be}} obese as adults. According to an article in The New York Times all of these health effects are contributing to a shorter lifespan of five years for these obese children. It is the first time in two centuries that the current generation of children in America may have a shorter lifespan than their parents.|$|E
25|$|Higher {{friendship}} quality directly {{contributes to}} self-esteem, self-confidence, and social development. A World Happiness Database {{study found that}} people with close friendships are happier, although the absolute number of friends did not increase happiness.Other studies have suggested <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> have friendships of a high quality may be protected against the development of certain disorders, such as anxiety and depression. Conversely, having few friends is associated with dropping out of school, as well as aggression, and adult crime. Peer rejection is also associated with lower later aspiration in the workforce, and participation in social activities, while higher levels of friendship was associated with higher adult self-esteem.|$|E

This is because they often have trouble sleeping due to their disorders. For example, children with ADHD tend to have trouble falling asleep because of their hyperactivity and, as a result, tend to be tired during most of the day. Another cause of insomnia in children with ADHD is the use of stimulants used to treat their disorder. Children who have ADHD then, {{as well as the other}} disorders mentioned, may be given melatonin before bedtime in order to help them sleep.|$|E

25|$|In India, {{there are}} only {{informal}} directives pertaining to pre-primary education, for which pre-primary schools and sections need no affiliation.

Typically, children spend 3 to 4 years {{of their time in}} pre-primary school after which they are eligible to attend 1st Standard in Primary School which falls under HRD ministry norms. Primary education is now compulsory in India, and accompanied with mid-day meals, {{in most parts of the}} country run by the government. Pre-primary is not mandatory, however preferred.

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{children}} forced into begging primarily receive little to no education, with upwards of sixteen hours a day dedicated to time on the streets. With education being a leading method in escaping poverty child beggars {{have been shown to}} engage in a cyclical process of continuing this practice cross-generationally. Interviews conducted by UNICEF show <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> beg have little hope for the future and do not believe their circumstances will improve. Children who work on the streets typically have little or no knowledge of their rights, leaving them especially susceptible to exploitation both as juveniles and later as adults. Children who beg have also been found by UNICEF to have much higher instances of HIV-infection due to lack of awareness and supervision on the streets.|$|E
25|$|Terracotta {{feeding bottles}} {{surviving}} {{from the third}} millennium BC in Sumeria indicate <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> were not being breastfed were receiving animal milk, probably from cows. It {{is possible that some}} infants directly suckled lactating animals, which served as alternatives to wet nurses. Unless another lactating woman was available, a mother who lacked enough breast milk was likely to lose her child. To avert that possibility if a wet nurse was not available, an animal such as a donkey, cow, goat, sheep or dog could be employed. Suckling directly was preferable to milking an animal and giving the milk, as contamination by microbes during the milking process could lead to the infant contracting a deadly diarrheal disease. It was not until as late as the 1870s that stored animal milk became safe to drink due to the invention of pasteurisation and sterilisation.|$|E
