5|$|Intersection, in {{collaboration}} with British telecommunications company BT and British advertising agency Primesight, is also planning to install up to 850 Links in the United Kingdom, including in London, beginning in 2017. The LinkUK kiosks, as they will be called, {{are similar to the}} LinkNYC kiosks in New York City. These Links will replace some of London's iconic <b>telephone</b> <b>booths</b> due to these booths' age. The first hundred Links would be installed in the borough of Camden. The Links will have tablets, but they will lack web browsing capabilities due to the problems that LinkNYC faced in enabling the tablet browsers.|$|E

This system was in effect in Brazil until 1997 when magnetic cards were introduced.

For the Olympics there were installed a time-keeping system from Longines, ten commentator and press desks with telephones and two <b>telephone</b> <b>booths.</b> A 60-kilowatt, 400 lux floodlight system was installed. The venue was inaugurated on 12 December 1951 with a hockey match between Norway and Switzerland.

Some systems have protective devices such as circuit breakers or Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCI), designed to isolate such a fault. However, {{in the absence of}} protective devices, if the devices fail, or if they are not installed correctly, a fault will go undetected until it either causes a failure of the circuit or until it is found by a person.|$|E

25|$|To {{the south}} of the Stock Pavilion is a small park known as Stockmans Rest. It has topiaried trees with slat benches around them. (On one of the benches is located a figure of a seated swagman from Expo 88). Two modern <b>telephone</b> <b>booths</b> are {{situated}} across from the Stockmens Bar and Grill. There is a small pavilion which appears to be an earlier structure, with later cladding. It has had {{about a third of the}} area partitioned off by a wall towards the rear which has metal wall cladding made to look like weatherboard. The park is very popular for weddings and the Stockman's Bar is used for the reception. There is a small pond and fountain behind the pavilion and a plaque commemorating that the area was redeveloped as an initiative of the ground staff in 1994.|$|E
500|$|A {{series of}} {{upgrades}} {{were made to}} the hill ahead of the 1952 Winter Olympics. A start platform was constructed {{at the top of the}} hill to ensure better start conditions. A double pull-hook ski lift was built on the north side of the hill. Floodlights were installed along the course to allow training and work during the evening. Ten loudspeakers and three microphones were installed as a transportable system. The hump at the top of the hill was leveled somewhat and the earthwork used to build out the bottom of the hill. The road from Lillevann Station on the Holmenkollen Line was upgraded and a tunnel laid under the course to allow spectators to gather on both sides. A 200-seat press stand, including work stations and <b>telephone</b> <b>booths,</b> was constructed on the south side of the bottom of the hill. Opposite a stand for official guests was built, with a capacity for 300 people. Boxes at the finish line were built for officials and time-keepers. The upgrades to the venue cost 336,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). During the Olympics the hill was [...] long and had a drop of , starting at [...] above mean sea level.|$|E
500|$|Soon I Will Be Invincible was {{published}} by Pantheon Books, an imprint of the Knopf Doubleday division of Random House, and released on June 5, 2007, as a hardcover. In the UK it {{was published}} by the Penguin Group imprint Michael Joseph. An audiobook was released {{at the same time}} featuring the voices of J. Paul Boehmer and Coleen Marlo. Grossman promoted the book by attending book signings in major American cities. In the UK it was promoted by wrapping <b>telephone</b> <b>booths</b> in advertising, in reference to Superman changing outfits in such booths. The cover art, which features photos of stereotypical comic book character clothing like a mask and gloves, by Chip Kidd was called [...] "excellent... sure to attract readers". By contrast, Bryan Hitch's cover art on the British edition, which features hand-drawn illustrations of the book's characters, was called [...] "counter-productive... unnecessary" [...] due to its graphical interpretations of characters that were deliberately written in prose only. The book was short-listed for the 2007 John Sargent Sr. First Novel Prize. Work on a film adaption began in 2008 through Strike Entertainment with scripts being written Dan Weiss and Grossman.|$|E

500|$|According to Argento expert Thomas Rostock, Tenebrae {{is filled}} with rhyming imagery that relates to the film's {{exploration}} of [...] "the dual nature of [...] two active murderers" [...] using doubles, inversions, reflections and [...] "re-reflections". Every major character {{has at least one}} double, and the theme extends to objects, locations, actions and events – major and minor. The doubling or mirroring of incidents and objects includes <b>telephone</b> <b>booths,</b> aircraft, homeless men, otherwise-meaningless public brawls in the background, car accidents, typewriters (literally side-by-side), keys, handkerchief, hands caught in doors and the characters themselves. Rostock cites several scenes where characters are set up in frame with their doppelgängers – one such is the first meeting of Peter Neal and Anne with Detectives Giermani and Altieri. McDonagh notes that Argento emphasizes the doubling between Neal and Giermani: [...] "Giermani... is made to reflect Neal even as Neal appropriates his role as investigator... the detective/writer and the writer/detective each belittles his other half, as though by being demeaned this inverted reflection could be made to go away." [...] McDonagh also observes that, in what is arguably the film's most potent shock, Neal at one point really does make Giermani [...] "go away", virtually replacing him on screen [...] "in a shot that is as schematically logical as it is logically outrageous." [...] Earlier, Neal killed a woman who – to his and the audience's surprise – was not Anne, but Altieri. Tenebrae itself is split almost exactly into two parts. The first half belongs to the murders of Berti; the second to those of Neal. The two are set up as mirrors of one another. Berti's killings with a razor are clinical, with [...] "lingering sexualized aggressiveness", whereas Neal's (with an axe) are crimes of passion committed for personal reasons or out of necessity; they are swift and to the point.|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1990s, tourism {{has fallen}} in the area, mostly due to petty crime and “hooligans” [...] Crime {{problems}} have lowered hotel residency rates. [...] The Nuestra Señora del Sagrado Corazón {{is located on the}} corner of Genova and Paseo de la Reforma. It suffered two thefts of religious images, one of Saint Charbel and the other called the “Virgen del Cobre” (Copper Virgin) in 2008. Male prostitution began in the area in 1995 and is mostly located on Hamburgo and Varsovia streets. Female prostitution is located mostly in three houses located on Dublin, Hamburgo and Chapultepec streets. Small scale drug trafficking is common, with merchandise hidden in <b>telephone</b> <b>booths,</b> garden areas and street vendor stalls. It is often advertised by people passing out flyers with the names of non-existent businesses in the State of Mexico. To combat crimes such as muggings, a special squad of “tourist police” now patrol the area, especially on less-travelled streets such as Praga, Toledo and Burdeos.|$|E
