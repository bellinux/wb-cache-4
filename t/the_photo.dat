5|$|A {{debate on}} whether <b>the</b> {{military}} <b>photos</b> {{should or should}} not be released to the public has taken place.

40|$|Title: Pojken som förändrade världen - en kvalitativ innehållsanalys av bilderna på Alan Kurdi Authors: Frida Bergstedt, Patricia Higson and Kajsa Kalméus Subject: Undergraduate {{research}} paper in journalism studies, Dept. of journalism, media and communication, (JMG) Gothenburg University Term: Spring 2016 Supervisor: Orla Vigsø Purpose: Our main {{purpose was to}} understand what makes <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> of Alan Kurdi stand out and to investigate why Swedish newspapers published <b>the</b> <b>photos.</b> We wanted to understand how <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> were presented in Swedish newspapers and how the presentation affected the interpretation of them. Method: Qualitative text analysis with a semiotic and rhetoric approach Procedure: We analysed articles with photos of Alan Kurdi that were published in Swedish newspapers between the 3 rd and 4 th of September 2015. Using theories about semiotics, rhetorics, newsworthiness and framing we analysed the material. The analysis was done in three steps: first we analysed <b>the</b> <b>photos,</b> then <b>the</b> text and lastly <b>the</b> text and <b>photos</b> combined. Results: We found that <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> of Alan Kurdi stand out because of many reasons. They contain a lot of pathos and they probably generate similar emotions independent of the viewer’s background or cultural belonging. The framing of <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> in <b>the</b> newspapers strengthens their status and affects {{the way they are}} perceived. The framing gives them an iconic status and makes them metonymic. <b>The</b> <b>photos</b> represent something bigger than themselves, in this case the refugee crisis. We also found that the reason why newspapers chose to publish <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> despite <b>the</b> ethical dilemma of doing so might have been because of the public interest. Another reason to publish <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> was that <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> themselves are <b>the</b> news. It is <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> and <b>the</b> reaction to them that is the news in this case, not the event that led to Alan Kurdis death...|$|R

Lowery presented <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> at <b>the</b> 1971 annual meeting of the American Ornithologists Union. Skeptics dismissed <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> as frauds; seeing that the bird is in roughly the same position in both photos, they suggested they may have been of a mounted specimen.|$|R

The same picture was mistakenly used by other agencies; {{it was on the}} website of The Daily Telegraph, but was removed a day later.

25|$|On 10 November 2010 Al Jazeera {{broadcast}} {{photographs that}} appeared to show the aftermath of Sri Lankan Army soldiers massacring civilians and executing Tamil Tigers {{in the final stages}} of the civil war.

Some of <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> showed naked bodies with blindfolds and hands tied behind their backs. They appear to have been executed. Al Jazeera could not verify the authenticity of the photographs. It had obtained them from Tamils who said they had obtained <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> from someone in the Sri Lankan military. The Sri Lankan government reacted by calling <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> lies and fabrications. It claimed that some of <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> were <b>the</b> same as those broadcast by Channel 4 News in May 2010.

5000|$|In the 1980s Philip J. Klass and Robert Sheaffer, {{journalists and}} notable skeptics, {{concluded}} that <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> were faked, {{and that the}} entire event was a hoax. Their primary argument was that shadows on a garage in the left-hand side of <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> proved that <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> were taken in the morning {{rather than in the}} early evening, as the Trents had claimed. Klass and Sheaffer argued that since the Trents had apparently lied about <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> were taken, their entire story was thus suspect. Klass and Sheaffer also argued that the Trents had shown an interest in UFOs prior to their sighting, and their analysis of <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> indicated that <b>the</b> object photographed was small and likely a model hanging from power lines visible at the top of <b>the</b> <b>photos.</b> They also believed the object may have been the detached rear-view mirror of a vehicle. When Sheaffer sent his research and conclusions to William Hartmann, Hartmann withdrew the positive assessment of the case he had sent to the Condon Committee.|$|R

Although the actual colour of the dress was eventually confirmed to be black and blue, the image prompted discussions surrounding the matter across various platforms, with users discussing their opinions on the colour and why they perceived the dress as being a certain colour.

5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object in <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> were as large as claimed, {{it would have had}} to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived.

5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> of the Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. <b>The</b> <b>photo</b> was intended as a message to the Emperor about who was going to be the senior partner in their relationship.|$|E
