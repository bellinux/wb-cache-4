2500|$|Symbolic {{violence}} is fundamentally {{the imposition of}} categories of thought and perception upon dominated social agents who then take the social order to be just.

2500|$|The {{preponderance}} {{of women in}} the movement has led to a body of academic literature exploring feminism and animal rights; feminism and vegetarianism or veganism, the oppression of women and animals, and the male association of women and animals with nature and emotion, rather than reason—an association that several feminist writers have embraced. Lori Gruen writes that women and animals serve the same symbolic function in a patriarchal society: both are [...] "the used"; <b>the</b> <b>dominated,</b> submissive [...] "Other". When the British feminist Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–1797) published A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), Thomas Taylor (1758–1835), a Cambridge philosopher, responded with an anonymous parody, A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes (1792), claiming that Wollstonecraft's arguments for women's rights could be applied equally to animals, a position he intended as reductio ad absurdum.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, the Ottoman {{authorities}} classed {{subjects of}} the Empire not by nationality, but by religion. During the nineteenth century, modern national consciousness began to increase among the south Slavs; some historians now {{believe that it was}} in this period that Catholic Bosnians increasingly began {{to think of themselves as}} Croats, and Orthodox Bosnians as Serbs. The beginnings of a Muslim Bosnian national consciousness is also first attested in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as these early Bosniak nationalists began to assert a national identity distinct from both their Orthodox and Catholic neighbors, and from the other Muslim inhabitants of the empire. Most Serb and Croat nationalists tend to deny a separate Bosniak national identity, claiming that Bosniaks were either Serb or Croat in origin, but of Islamic religion. This debate, whether Bosnia and the Bosniaks are [...] "really" [...] Croats, Serbs, or a separate Bosniak Bosnian nation, has energized debates among nationalists until the present day. Anthropologists find the nationalist statements on Serbian or Croatian origin rather irrational and ultimately undignified attention, since, with a few notable exceptions, the ethnicity and history of <b>the</b> <b>dominated</b> in communist and monarchy Yugoslavia has been prescribed by the dominators and by the general demographics of a region.|$|E

The anecdotal perspective in Decolonising the Mind lends a certain accessibility to readers on political or theoretical issues that {{is missing from}} much of the typical and more disengaged academic discussions of linguistic imperialism and post-colonialism.

He had come to accept the Makerere conference as genuinely African, but he recounts how years later he was struck by his and others' blithe omission of many famous African language writers.
