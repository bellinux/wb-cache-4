5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} of the cantata on 16 June 1715. The performance material for Weimar is lost. Bach performed the work again as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. Extant performance material was prepared by his assistant Johann Christian Köpping. The first possible revival is the Trinity Sunday of Bach's first year in office, 4 June 1724, also the conclusion of his first year and first Leipzig cantata cycle, because he had assumed <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>on</b> the first Sunday after Trinity the year before. Bach made presumably minor changes.|$|E
5|$|Burchard {{continued}} to hold the treasurership until at least October 1194, when he last is mentioned in the office.

In June 1195 both Burchard and his rival, Philip of Poitou, were at the royal court in Le Mans, presumably both attempting to secure the bishopric. Philip was appointed to the see in November 1195.|$|E

5|$|It {{appeared}} that Brooks had exhausted all legal avenues at this point, but on June 16, 1873, he filed another lawsuit against Baxter, {{this time with}} the Pulaski County district court. Under Arkansas Civil Code sec. 525, if a person usurps an office or franchise to which he is not entitled, an action at law may be instituted against him either by the State or by the party rightly entitled to <b>the</b> <b>office.</b> <b>On</b> October 8, 1873, Baxter filed a plea of non-jurisdiction, but he believed that the court might decide against him.

5|$|The {{comedy series}} focuses on Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), the deputy {{director}} of the parks and recreation department of the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana. The season consisted of six 22-minute episodes, all of which aired at 8:30p.m. on Thursdays. Daniels and Schur conceived the show when NBC officials asked Daniels to produce a spin-off of his comedy series <b>The</b> <b>Office,</b> <b>on</b> which Schur was a writer. During development, the creators decided the new show would be a stand-alone series, though it would share the mockumentary style of The Office. Like that show, Parks and Recreation encouraged improvisation among its cast members.|$|E
5|$|The see of Canterbury was vacant for {{two years}} after the death of Theodore before Berhtwald was elected to <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>on</b> 1 July 692. The long vacancy {{resulted}} from the disturbed conditions in the kingdom of Kent at the time, as various kings fought for control. The succession to the kingdom was disputed between rival claimants Oswine and Wihtred, and various outside kings, including Caedwalla and Swaefheard raided and plundered Kent. Eventually, Wihtred secured the throne, around 691 or early 692, as Bede names Wihtred as King of Kent, along with Swaefheard, at the time of Berhtwald's election. Swaerfheard, however, is not named as king of Kent after this date.|$|E

5|$|As state superintendent, Paulus helped {{introduce}} statewide assessment {{testing for}} grades 3, 5, 8, and 11 in 1991. Other education reforms introduced that year were the Certificate of Initial Mastery (CIM) and Certificate of Advanced Mastery (CAM) {{that were designed}} to replace the high school diploma in Oregon. These were optional programs which {{were part of a}} broader program that included issuing a report card outlining the progress as a state, as required by a law the state legislature passed in 1991. Paulus also supported school to work initiatives for reforming public education while in office, which were part of the 1991 reforms. At the time Paulus was one of only ten women in the nation to hold the top education position in their state. She left <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>on</b> January 4, 1999, after two terms. In 2007, the Oregon Legislature eliminated the optional certificates from schools in the state.|$|E
5|$|In 1173, {{more than}} two years after the murder of Becket, King Henry II of England decided to fill the vacant archbishopric of Canterbury; there were two candidates: Richard, and Odo, prior of Canterbury. Previously, Roger, the abbot of Bec Abbey, had been elected, but refused <b>the</b> <b>office.</b> <b>On</b> 3 June 1173, Richard was chosen, {{although}} the monks preferred Odo. Both sides appealed to Rome, and Richard journeyed to Rome with Reginald fitz Jocelin, who had recently been elected Bishop of Bath, to rebut the charges of simony, illegitimate birth, and swearing an oath to the king that had been raised. After hearing the charges, they were dismissed and the election was ratified on 2 April 1174 and on 7 April 1174 the new archbishop was consecrated at Anagni by Pope Alexander III. Richard returned to England {{at the close of the}} year bearing his pallium which he had received directly from the pope. He was also granted legatine powers by Alexander III.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, Brisbane {{residents}} {{petitioned the}} New South Wales Government, which controlled the Queensland area until Queensland's separation in 1859, {{to establish a}} lighthouse on Cape Moreton. The government also wanted to encourage ships to use the broader and safer northern passage. Planning for the structure therefore commenced in 1852. The site was selected and surveyed in 1853, and the lighthouse was designed in 1854 by Edmund Blacket the New South Wales Colonial Architect of the time. However, Blacket resigned on 10 June 1854, for the private market, and left <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>on</b> 25 August. The office remained vacant until 1 October 1854, when Blacket was succeeded by William Weaver. Drawings for the tower which were completed in September 1854 were signed by Alexander Beazeley, Foreman of Works in the Colonial Architect's office. The tower was finally built during the office of Alexander Dawson who succeeded Weaver in 1856, and signed further drawings made in April 1856.|$|E

5|$|In late 2014 {{and early}} 2015, Rivers briefly {{considered}} running {{to be the}} chair of Clark County, a new position created with the home rule charter that Rivers worked to pass. There is no official rule against serving both as the chair and a state senator, but there were concerns about Rivers' ability to balance the two offices. In December 2014, Rivers officially announced she would run for <b>the</b> <b>office.</b> <b>On</b> March 2, 2015, The Columbian reported Rivers would likely be withdrawing from the race later that week.

5|$|The {{detailed}} {{investigation into}} corruption that St Vincent began {{caused him to}} become extremely unpopular as many influential men {{were involved in the}} various money making schemes perpetrated. The board of inquiry set up by St Vincent was responsible for the impeachment of Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville and his trial for misappropriation of public funds. St Vincent had made an enemy of Pitt and Pitt used the naval reform and its unpopularity to attack the First Lord and the Addington administration. St Vincent left <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>on</b> 14 May 1804 when Addington was replaced as Prime Minister by Pitt. Lord Howick, second son of St Vincent's friend Sir Charles Grey came to his defence and with the assistance of Charles James Fox moved for a vote of thanks in the Commons for St Vincent's tireless efforts in naval reform in 1806.|$|E
5|$|In 1697, Parliament granted King William £50,000 to {{establish}} a household for the Duke of Gloucester, though the King only permitted the release of £15,000, keeping the difference for himself. The establishment of Gloucester's own household in early 1698 revived the feud between Anne and William. William was determined to limit Anne's involvement in the household, and therefore appointed, against her wishes, the low church Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, as Gloucester's preceptor. Anne was high church, and Burnet, knowing she was unhappy, attempted to decline the appointment, but the King insisted he accept it. Anne's anger was only placated by an assurance from King William that she could choose all the lower servants of the household. The Earl of Marlborough, a friend of Anne's, was appointed Gloucester's governor, after the Duke of Shrewsbury declined <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>on</b> the grounds of ill health. Shortly before the King sailed for the Netherlands, he received Anne's choices from Marlborough {{but he refused to}} confirm them. His favourite, the Earl of Albemarle, eventually convinced him to agree to Anne's appointments, and the King's acceptance was sent from the Netherlands in September 1698. The Marlboroughs' twelve-year-old son, Lord Churchill, was appointed Gloucester's Master of the Horse, and became a friend and playmate. Abigail Hill, a kinswoman of the Countess of Marlborough, was appointed his laundress, and Abigail's brother, Jack Hill, was made one of Gloucester's gentlemen of the bedchamber.|$|E
