5|$|His {{real estate}} {{interests}} in California flourished, {{and he was}} an early environmentalist as well as promoter of the new metropolis. He believed deeply in Los Angeles becoming a major city with a seaport. <b>The</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> use water from across local mountains, and would recreate Lake Cahuilla.|$|E
5|$|In December 1999, a {{disagreement}} arose between the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the city; <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> not except the government's promise to finance {{part of the}} line. Both Minister of Transport and Communications, Dag Jostein Fjærvoll from the Christian Democratic Party and Oslo City Commissioner of Transport and the Environment, Merete Agerbak-Jensen from the Conservative Party, agreed upon the distribution of funding {{from the city and}} state, and both wanted construction to start as soon as possible. The city council did not accept the guarantees from the state until March 2000. Construction started in June, with the Agency for Road and Transport of the municipality responsible for construction. <b>The</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> pay NOK 224 million, while the state would pay NOK 673 million.|$|E
50|$|On April 1, 2009, <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> to have metered billing were announced. In {{addition}} to Beaumont, Texas, <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> <b>would</b> be Rochester, New York; Austin, Texas; San Antonio, Texas; and Greensboro, North Carolina.|$|R
25|$|As {{a ruling}} institution, the Ottoman Empire brought {{regulations}} on how <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> <b>would</b> be built (quality reassurances) {{and how the}} architecture (structural integrity, social needs, etc.) should be shaped.|$|R

5|$|On 6 July 2007, Best was {{inducted}} into the All You Need Is Liverpool Music Hall of Fame as the debut Charter Member. Best was presented with a framed certificate before his band performed. Liverpool has further honoured Best with the announcement, on 25 July 2011, that two new streets in <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> be named Pete Best Drive and Casbah Close.|$|E
5|$|The {{control of}} Vijithapura was {{essential}} to both sides. The loss of the stronghold would be a largely demoralizing factor for Elara's forces and would significantly reduce their capability to resist Duthhagamani's advance. For Dutthagamani's forces, the capture of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> mean that they could easily move on to Anuradhapura.|$|E
5|$|Distressed by the {{occupation}} of Khafji, Saudi commander General Khaled bin Sultan appealed to American General Norman Schwarzkopf for an immediate air campaign against Iraqi forces {{in and around the}} city. However this was turned down because the buildings would make it difficult for aircraft to spot targets without getting too close. It was instead decided that <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> be retaken by Arab ground forces. The task fell to the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 7th Battalion, composed of Saudi infantry and two Kuwaiti tank companies attached to the task force. These were supported by U.S. Army Special Forces and Marine Reconnaissance personnel.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>city</b> was {{positioned}} in a strategic position. During {{several months of}} the year, the flood plains around <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> <b>would</b> be flooded by the many rivers around <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Enemy sieges were thus impossible, and forced to withdraw. This advantage was a contributing factor in the many failed Burmese invasions.|$|R
60|$|This {{satisfied}} for a {{time his}} desire to visit <b>the</b> earth <b>cities,</b> but soon <b>the</b> monotony of his existence again made him restless and gave him another thought.

5|$|During the battle, however, North Korean {{troops were}} able to {{surprise}} US troops on Hill 303 and capture them. Late in the battle, these troops were machine gunned in the Hill 303 massacre. Despite these setbacks, the UN forces were successful in driving most of the North Koreans off, but the decisive battle to secure <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> occur during the Battle of the Bowling Alley.|$|E
5|$|He {{then went}} to the Presidential Palace in central Yogyakarta, where the {{government}} leaders were discussing an ultimatum which stated that <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> be stormed unless the leadership accepted colonial rule. Sudirman urged that the president and vice-president leave the city and fight as guerrillas, actions they had previously promised, but this suggestion was rejected. Although his doctors forbade it, Sudirman received permission from Sukarno to join his men. The central government evacuated to the Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat at the urging of Sultan HamengkubuwanaIX, but were captured and exiled.|$|E
5|$|However, some {{problems}} have been encountered with basing agencies in the eastern states. For example, Frontex, the new border agency, has had problems recruiting skilled experts because many {{do not want to}} live in the agency's host city, Warsaw, due to its relatively low wages and standard of living. In addition, plans to place the headquarters of Galileo in Prague met with opposition over security concerns that <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> not be safe enough for such a sensitive agency.|$|E
50|$|For example, in the 2003 {{boundary}} adjustment, {{the boundary}} commission in Ontario originally proposed dividing <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Greater Sudbury into three districts. The urban core would have remained largely unchanged as Sudbury, while communities west of <b>the</b> central <b>city</b> <b>would</b> have been merged with Algoma—Manitoulin {{to form the}} new riding of Greater Sudbury—Manitoulin, and those east and north of <b>the</b> central <b>city</b> <b>would</b> have been merged with Timiskaming to create the riding of Timiskaming—Greater Sudbury.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>city</b> {{government}} <b>would</b> {{convene a}} provincial convention {{to review and}} propose amendments to the National Constitution.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis, {{responsible}} for New York City's green areas, and Ron Delsener, {{one of the}} city's most influential concert promoters, developed the idea of helping Central Park financially with a free open-air concert, under the legal guidance of Bob Donnelly. <b>The</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> use profits from merchandising, television, and video rights to renovate the park. Earlier park performances by Elton John and James Taylor showed that this concept could be a success. Davis authorized the project, and Delsener entered discussions with cable TV channel HBO to decide who would perform.|$|E
5|$|Seventh-century Muslim armies had no siege equipment, and {{typically}} employed siege tactics {{only when there}} were no other options. Without the necessary siege equipment, armies of the early Muslim expansion would surround a city, denying it supplies until the city's defenders surrendered. Meanwhile any chance of breaking into <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> be availed, if possible, using stealth and espionage. Muslim armies would usually isolate the city {{from the rest of the}} region and deploy scouts along vital routes.|$|E
5|$|The French {{crews of}} Henri IV {{received}} a telegraph from Admiral de Gueydon, {{suggesting that the}} bombardment of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> begin soon, which the crews welcomed with enthusiasm. By then, a large crowd of people in Rabat and Salé had gathered to observe the French ships after they were spotted by Moroccan artillery operators. Admiral de Gueydon decided against starting the bombardment until consul Elton was aboard Caton; the consul did not come aboard the ship until four hours later. At dawn on 26 November though, the British steamer Janus joined Caton, and took the consul as its passenger.|$|E
50|$|The second {{suggestion}} was from <b>the</b> <b>city</b> planner, Trygve Thesen, in 1917. He proposed alternative routes. While the upper sections were identical {{or close to}} those of Bjerke, Thesen suggested making a large loop around Dyrborg, just west of Ila. This {{was expected to be}} the immediate growth area for <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> and <b>would</b> give an improved passenger base for the line. It would, however, increase the travel distance to the upper sections. <b>The</b> <b>city</b> planner presumed that the section within <b>the</b> <b>city</b> limit <b>would</b> be built by the municipal Trondhjems Elektricitetsværk og Sporvei, while the section in Strinda would be built by the new company. This <b>would</b> cost <b>the</b> <b>city</b> , while it <b>would</b> cost the company NOK 413,000.|$|R
50|$|A {{major reason}} for {{building}} the station was to promote the urban development of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Vaihingen and it was envisaged that <b>the</b> core <b>city</b> <b>would</b> merge with <b>the</b> village of Kleinglattbach.|$|R
50|$|While {{a control}} city may not {{appear on the}} signs of every single junction, <b>the</b> control <b>city</b> <b>would</b> at least appear on major junctions.|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} city employees, or agents, grew from 40,000 in 2000 to 73,000 in 2013. The city debt grew from €1.6 billion in 2000 to 3.1 billion in 2012, with {{a debt of}} €3.65 billion {{expected}} for 2014. As {{a result of the}} growing debt, the bond rating of the city was lowered from AAA to AA+ in both 2012 and 2013. In September 2014, Mayor Hidalgo announced that <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> have budget shortfall of €400 million, largely because of a cut in support from the national government.|$|E
5|$|The war effort, debilitated by {{a rebellious}} {{confederation}} {{established by the}} unpaid military, was continued. Turkey, threatened by the Polish territorial gains became involved at the frontiers, and a peace between Russia and Sweden was agreed to in 1617. Fearing the new alliance the Commonwealth undertook one more major expedition, which took over Vyazma and arrived at the walls of Moscow, {{in an attempt to}} impose the rule of Władysław Vasa again. <b>The</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> not open its gates and not enough military strength was brought in to attempt a forced take-over.|$|E
5|$|The {{water was}} turned off at the {{fountain}} from 2001 until 2004, reopening on August 2, 2004. San Francisco estimated the cost of electricity was approximately US$200,000 per year to operate the fountain. Peskin negotiated a public-private partnership where <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> pay for the operating costs (at a revised estimate of US$76,000 per year) and Boston Properties would pay for maintenance (estimated at US$20,000 per year). The fountain was shut off again {{during the winter of}} 2007–08 starting in November 2007 so that skaters at the Justin Herman Plaza ice rink would not be splashed. It reopened on January 21, 2008.|$|E

5000|$|Property owners {{voted in}} favour of {{improving}} water supply in <b>the</b> <b>city</b> which <b>would</b> involve allowing <b>the</b> <b>city</b> to spend $1,315,000 for a water filtration system.|$|R
5|$|After World War II, and {{following}} considerable controversy, the City of Philadelphia {{agreed that it}} would transfer custody of the bell and Independence Hall, while retaining ownership, to the federal government. <b>The</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> also transfer various colonial-era buildings it owned. Congress agreed to the transfer in 1948, and three years later Independence National Historical Park was founded, incorporating those properties and administered by the National Park Service (NPS or Park Service). The Park Service {{would be responsible for}} maintaining and displaying the bell. The NPS would also administer the three blocks just north of Independence Hall, which had been condemned by the state, razed, and developed into a park, Independence Mall.|$|E
5|$|After {{six months}} of siege the Dutch had re-opened the sea lanes. Charles now faced a {{difficult}} choice: {{if he tried to}} sue for peace, the conditions would have been worse than the previous peace. The other option was an all-out attack on Copenhagen, hoping that conquering <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> end the war. The number of Swedish attackers are somewhat uncertain, roughly 8,000 men, comprising 4,500 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, 1,000 sailors and a few hundred gunners. The king planned the attack meticulously, but neglected to uphold adequate secrecy; the Danes were soon fully aware of the details of the Swedish attack plan thanks to a number of deserters and spies able to move between the encampments. The Danes had 6,000 trained soldiers, and an additional 5,000 men and women from the city had also taken up weapons, bringing the number of defenders to 11,000.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time the attack on <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>would</b> mark {{the first time that the}} revolutionary army would confront federal forces in a regular battle rather than relying on guerrilla tactics. While the fusion of Madero's, Villa's and Orozco's men did result in a number of troops {{sufficient}} to form a force capable of fighting professional soldiers in pitched encounters, the federal troops still had the advantage in terms of training and discipline. The government, in fact, had a good chance of squashing the rebels by moving troops down from the state capital of Ciudad Chihuahua and capturing Madero in a pincer movement. However, the Díaz-appointed governor of the state, Miguel Ahumada, was worried that if the soldiers abandoned the capital unrest would break out and the insurrection would spread. As a further sign of the apparent demoralization of federal rank-and-file soldiers (many of whom had been forcibly conscripted and actually sympathized with the revolutionaries), the troops in Ciudad Chihuahua decided to stay put.|$|E
50|$|Lacedaemon named <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Sparta {{after his}} wife. However, <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> name <b>would</b> also be his own, {{as it was}} called either Lacedaemon or Sparta interchangeably.|$|R
