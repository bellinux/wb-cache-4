5|$|A Scientology {{representative}} in France {{asserted that the}} Scientology personality <b>test</b> <b>was</b> not created by the Church of Scientology, {{and that it was}} not related to Ballo's death. The Church of Scientology's information chief in Norway, Matthias Fosse stated that the <b>test</b> <b>was</b> not dangerous and that the organization did not bear any responsibility for Ballo's death. Ballo's father retained a lawyer to investigate his daughter's death, and the family considered filing a lawsuit against Scientology. 500 people attended Ballo's funeral on April 11, 2008 at Grefsen Church in Oslo, Norway.|$|E

50|$|While monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} {{treated the}} same as fuzz testing and the two terms are usually used together, some believe they are different by arguing that monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> more about random actions while fuzz <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> more about random data input. Monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> also different from ad-hoc testing in that ad-hoc <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> performed without planning and documentation and the objective of ad-hoc <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> to divide the system randomly into subparts and check their functionality, {{which is not the}} case in monkey testing.|$|R
30|$|In general terms, a {{positive}} likelihood ratio {{of more than}} 10 indicates that a <b>test</b> <b>is</b> good at confirming disease if the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> positive and a negative likelihood ratio of less than 0.1 indicates that the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> good at excluding disease when the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> negative.|$|R
5000|$|Confirmatory <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> the <b>tests</b> {{required}} {{to confirm the}} analysis. Confirmatory tests cost more than simpler presumptive tests so presumptive <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> often done to see if confirmatory <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> necessary.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{reliability}} <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> {{the focus}} in the research of reliability testing at present. The basic concepts of reliability <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> introduced. Names of reliability <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> sorted. Characteristics of mechanical reliability <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> discussed. The key issues of mechanical reliability testing and its development are then reviewed. Finally, some possible fields in the research are summarized...|$|R
50|$|A <b>test</b> tube <b>is</b> {{filled with}} {{distilled}} water and acetic acid is added. To this mixture one drop of the effusion to <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> <b>is</b> added. If the drop dissipates, the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> negative, indicating a transudate. If the drop precipitates, the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> positive, indicating an exudate.|$|R

5|$|A win in {{the third}} <b>Test</b> <b>was</b> vital to keep the Lions hope of a series win alive. John scored ten points of the 13–3 win, the other three coming from Wales' team-mate Gerald Davies. The final Test ended in a 14–14 draw, giving the series to the tourists. John scored eight of the Lions points, having scored in every match, Test and regional, he had played in.|$|E
50|$|The frontal <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> {{performed}} at 64 km/h into an offset deformable barrier. This {{is designed to}} represent an impact with a vehicle of similar mass and structure as the car itself.The side impact <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> {{performed at}} 50 km/h, but the side impact pole <b>test</b> <b>is</b> performed at 32 km/h.

5|$|Able and Baker are {{the first}} two letters of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, used from 1941 until 1956. Alpha and Bravo are their {{counterparts}} in the current NATO phonetic alphabet. Charlie is the third letter in both systems. According to eyewitness accounts, the time of detonation for each <b>test</b> <b>was</b> announced as H or How hour; in the official JTF-1 history, the term M or Mike hour is used instead.|$|E
5|$|After Milrow was conducted, {{there was}} {{continued}} {{pressure on the}} part of environmental groups against going forward with the larger Cannikin test, while the Federation of American Scientists claimed that the warhead being tested was already obsolete. In May 1971, Gravel sent a letter to U.S. Atomic Energy Commission hearings held in Anchorage, in which he said the risk of the <b>test</b> <b>was</b> not worth taking.|$|E
5|$|An inept batsman with {{an average}} of 5.78 in his {{first-class}} career, Toshack managed a Test average of 51.00 on the 1948 tour after being dismissed only once, behind only Arthur Morris, Sid Barnes, Bradman and Neil Harvey. The unbeaten 20 he managed in the Lord's <b>Test</b> <b>was</b> his best first-class score, made in a freewheeling tenth-wicket stand with Johnston.|$|E
30|$|The island {{partition}} {{result is}} not feasible if the DER dispatch test or the power flow <b>test</b> <b>is</b> not passed. Model modification and adjustment strategies {{corresponding to the}} <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> given in this section. Firstly, the cases that fail the DER dispatch <b>test</b> <b>are</b> analyzed and modification of the constraint set is proposed. Secondly, adjustment strategies based on the power flow <b>test</b> <b>are</b> given.|$|R
50|$|Automated <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> {{advantageous}} for {{a number}} of reasons: <b>tests</b> may <b>be</b> executed continuously without the need for human intervention, they are easily repeatable, and often faster. Automated <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> useful in situations where the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> to be executed several times, for example as part of regression testing. Automated <b>tests</b> can <b>be</b> disadvantageous when poorly written, leading to incorrect testing or broken tests being carried out.|$|R
40|$|The multisample {{version of}} the Cucconi rank test for the two-sample location-scale problem is proposed. Even though little known, the Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> of {{interest}} for several reasons. The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> compared with some Lepage-type <b>tests.</b> It <b>is</b> shown that the multisample Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> slightly {{more powerful than the}} multisample Lepage test. Moreover, its <b>test</b> statistic can <b>be</b> computed analytically whereas several others cannot. A practical application example in experimental nutrition is presented. An R function to perform the multisample Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> given...|$|R
5|$|Australia went on {{to start}} the post-war Ashes era with a {{crushing}} win by an innings and 332 runs. Hassett made 34 as Australia won the Second Test by an innings, and the Third <b>Test</b> <b>was</b> his first Test on his home ground at the MCG. He made only 12 and 9 as England held on for a draw with three wickets in hand.|$|E
5|$|France first toured South Africa {{winning the}} test series in 1958. The Springboks also visited Paris in 1961, the <b>test</b> <b>was</b> not {{completed}} due to onfield fighting amongst the players. France also toured New Zealand and Australia in 1961 losing both tests against the All Blacks but defeating Australia's Wallabies. They won their first Five Nations Grand Slam in 1968 by beating all four other competing teams, and won numerous {{titles in the}} following years.|$|E
5|$|IQ classifications for {{individuals}} also vary because category labels for IQ score ranges {{are specific to}} each brand of test. The test publishers {{do not have a}} uniform practice of labeling IQ score ranges, nor do they have a consistent practice of dividing up IQ score ranges into categories of the same size or with the same boundary scores. Thus psychologists should specify which <b>test</b> <b>was</b> given when reporting a test-taker's IQ. Psychologists and IQ test authors recommend that psychologists adopt the terminology of each test publisher when reporting IQ score ranges.|$|E
40|$|The finite sample {{properties}} of recent <b>tests</b> of contagion <b>are</b> investigated using {{a range of}} Monte Carlo experiments. Some variations of these <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> also investigated to correct for size distortions and weak instrument problems. The finite sample {{results show that the}} Forbes-Rigobon and Pesaran-Pick <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> conservative <b>tests,</b> while the Favero-Giavazzi and Bae-Karolyi-Stulz <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> oversized. Two proposed variants of the Forbes and Rigobon <b>test</b> <b>are</b> shown to improve upon the sampling {{properties of}} this test. The change in the correlation <b>test</b> <b>is</b> shown to be a non-monotonic function of the strength of contagion resulting in non-monotonic power functions...|$|R
50|$|Bartlett's <b>test</b> <b>is</b> {{sensitive}} to departures from normality. That is, if the samples come from non-normal distributions, then Bartlett's <b>test</b> may simply <b>be</b> <b>testing</b> for non-normality. Levene's {{test and the}} Brown-Forsythe <b>test</b> <b>are</b> alternatives to the Bartlett <b>test</b> that <b>are</b> less {{sensitive to}} departures from normality.|$|R
50|$|Regression <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> used {{to check}} if any new bugs have been {{introduced}} through previous bug fixes. Regression <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> conducted after every change or update in the software features. This <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> periodic, depending on the length and features of the software.|$|R
5|$|In March 1944, {{planning}} for the <b>test</b> <b>was</b> assigned to Kenneth Bainbridge, a {{professor of physics at}} Harvard, working under Kistiakowsky. Bainbridge selected the bombing range near Alamogordo Army Airfield as the site for the test. Bainbridge worked with Captain Samuel P. Davalos on the construction of the Trinity Base Camp and its facilities, which included barracks, warehouses, workshops, an explosive magazine and a commissary.|$|E
5|$|In May 1967, {{participants}} from six councils met at Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation in New Jersey to train {{to prepare the}} new course and follow-on courses. The first laboratory <b>test</b> <b>was</b> during June 1967. Participants from five councils delivered the June course and follow-on council courses. The councils represented were Del-Mar-Va Council in Wilmington, Delaware; Baltimore Area Council in Baltimore, Maryland; Valley Forge Council in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Onondaga Council in Syracuse, New York; and the National Capital Area Council in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of January 4, 1962, the three-car automated train began service, with a ceremony. The trains carried a stand-by motorman during the six-month trial period. The train had scheduled to begin service on December 15, 1961, but Quill threatened to strike all city- and private-owned transit in the city if the train ran. Under the new contract with the TWU, the NYCTA agreed to put a motorman in the train during the experimental period. While in its experimental period, the automated train was only operating during rush hours. In July, the <b>test</b> <b>was</b> extended for three more months, and in October the <b>test</b> <b>was</b> extended for six additional months. The chairman of the NYCTA, Charles Patterson, was disappointed by the automated shuttle train, doubting that the train could be operated without any transit personnel on board. Initially, the automation of the shuttle was expected to save $150,000 a year in labor costs; however, with one employee still required on the train, there would essentially be no savings. If the test succeeded, it was planned to automate the IRT Flushing Line, the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, and the Culver Shuttle. However, the NYCTA did not have plans to automate the whole system.|$|E
40|$|The {{fluorescent}} treponemal antibody-absorption double-staining step-by-step {{procedure and}} proposed reference reagents for the <b>test</b> <b>are</b> described. The <b>test</b> and reagents <b>were</b> evaluated {{in two separate}} laboratories on 265 fresh sera, and <b>test</b> results <b>were</b> compared with the reference {{fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test}} results performed in a third laboratory. The data indicate that the <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> comparable in the areas where the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> recommended for use. Problems with inadequate light filtration occurred, but these could <b>be</b> resolved. This <b>test</b> <b>is</b> recommended for use with microscopes equipped with incident illumination...|$|R
