5|$|In March, Joan has a Marilyn Monroe hairstyle and {{the safe}} at the cinema is broken into. Ahead of the party, Freddie gives Reg {{the use of}} his car, to return unused decorating {{materials}} to Guildford and he takes his father, Reenie and her boyfriend Clayton Cooper (Roger Griffiths) with him. They run out of petrol on the way, leaving Freddie and Joan the only ones at the party. They dance, and Freddie admits {{that he wanted to be}} alone with Joan so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> about art. They end the night by sleeping together.|$|E
5|$|The telethon's {{talent pool}} becomes {{so low that}} Leslie is forced to flip a coin {{in front of the}} camera and talk about her {{favorite}} episodes of Friends. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is allowed to play the piano, but everyone dismisses his skilled playing as a racket. Mark finally returns to propose and walks on the set with the ring, but Leslie stops him by mooning the camera. Detlef Schrempf and Tom finally arrive at the end of Leslie's programming block. Detlef presents a check for $5,000, allowing the telethon to bypass its $20,000 mark. Despite being awake for two days straight, Leslie goes to Ann's house so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> about Mark. She then promptly falls asleep on Ann's couch for 22 hours.|$|E
5|$|On May 23, 1994, Mexican State Judicial Police arrested Olivarez {{again in}} Matamoros for {{possessing}} two stolen vehicles. He {{was interviewed by}} Mexican authorities and stated {{that he was not}} guilty of Fischer's murder. He admitted to having stolen cars since he was young, and stated that Garza was trying to put the blame on him to protect himself from prosecution. Olivarez justified himself by saying that he had never been arrested with a gun. He admitted going to Dallas in 1992, but stated that he only knew Garza by name. He said he was a self-employed auto mechanic who supported his wife, mother, and uncle. Mexican officials said that Olivarez's auto theft ring extended all the way to Monterrey, as well as in Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. There was an arrest warrant for him issued by a state judge in Reynosa for being connected to about 50 car thefts. Brownsville investigators went to Mexico to see if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to Olivarez, and began extradition procedings to bring him to a Texan court.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wednesday.--Aroa and Matlavo. 'Henry Tagalana and Joanna {{and their}} baby Elizabeth, William Pasvorang and Lydia, and six others, all baptized, and four communicants among them, had spent five weeks on shore; {{a very nice}} set. Six of them lived {{together}} at Aroa, had regular morning and evening prayers, sang their hymns, and did what <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> <b>talking</b> to their people. Codrington went over in a canoe, and spent four days with them, much pleased. We brought three scholars for George from thence.|$|R
60|$|The {{first day}} passed rapidly and the Golden Eagle made good headway. The boys {{spent most of}} the time on deck, amusing {{themselves}} as best <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> <b>They</b> <b>talked</b> to Captain Sanders and his mate, and also visited with Billy Dill. Occasionally they conversed with the four Englishmen, but they noticed that the Britishers were inclined to keep to themselves.|$|R
50|$|Barani further {{states that}} there was a strict {{enforcement}} of these rules. Even when the nobles met each other at the royal palace, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> with ease. They took great care to avoid people with bad reputation.|$|R
25|$|Sebold had {{delivered}} microphotograph instructions to Roeder, as ordered by German authorities. Roeder and Sebold met {{in public places}} and proceeded to spots where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> privately. In 1936, Roeder had visited Germany and was requested by German authorities {{to act as an}} espionage agent. Primarily due to monetary rewards he would receive, Roeder agreed.|$|E
25|$|In the Second Test Ray Illingworth {{was put in}} to bat, but Rowan refused {{his request}} for the roller to be used on the wicket before play began. Rowan later {{realised}} his mistake and apologised in the lunch break. Even John Snow applauded when he and Tom Brooks refused to start play at Melbourne in the abandoned Third Test. Ian Johnson and the Melbourne authorities were desperate to get the game going, but the umpires refused to be pressured as the field was quite unfit for play. Snow found Max O'Connell 'a very reasonable and fair man, even if I {{did not agree with}} him' and that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> problems through. Brooks {{was the only one of}} the umpires who had played First Class Cricket – he had been a lively fast-medium bowler – and as a result was more able to connect with the Test players, and was more forgiving of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game.|$|E
25|$|Charlie's {{research}} often {{interferes with}} his relationships: as with Amita {{on their first}} date, for all <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> about is mathematics; Fleinhardt {{says that it is}} a common interest and they should not struggle to avoid the subject. Charlie and Amita had several false starts. Charlie has also spent some time with his ex-girlfriend, Susan Berry (Sonya Walger), an attractive neuroscientist from London. He had lived with Susan for two years, and Larry described this as his very own Berry's phase. However, she later reveals that she is currently involved with someone else and has to return to England. Charlie attempts to start a relationship with Amita once more, though her job offer at Harvard University strains this possibility and makes him distraught for some time. Eventually, she decides to take the alternative offer at CalSci with the hope to begin a romantic relationship with him, though his fear of possible failure causes him to question whether he wants this second chance; Don cautions him about such an attitude. Amita notices his ambivalence and isn't certain if she wants to back out of the relationship, but he then pushes it forward. Pressures from their colleagues over the inappropriateness of the relationship nearly cost them, but {{by the middle of the}} third season their romantic involvement stabilizes and they have grown considerably closer. He feels rejected when Amita does not want him to meet her father, due to his expectations about the men she dates. Initially, he wonders if it is based on him being Jewish, but the problem is that he is not Indian-born. Alan explains that Mr. Ramanujan would like him after meeting him. Charlie and Amita state that they love each other, and have even decided to move in together, though, the actual living arrangement has not been determined. When Amita's parents finally meet him, they are rude, but warm to him later. Alan says that Charlie will have to marry her.|$|E
30|$|Both {{the coaches}} {{and the men}} {{suggested}} inviting previous participants along to the training for the new coaches. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> give <b>talks</b> and share their specific experiences, providing the opportunity to ask {{someone who has been}} in the same situation questions.|$|R
60|$|The party {{came home}} in due time, and after one kiss to Margaret, given in silence, dispersed, for <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not yet <b>talk</b> {{of what had}} passed.|$|R
50|$|The SURGEON controller, {{consisting}} of a flight surgeon (either a military or civilian doctor), monitored the astronaut's vital signs during the flight, and if a medical need arose, <b>could</b> recommend treatment. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> also <b>talk</b> directly to the astronaut crew {{if there was a}} medical need that the astronauts needed to discuss.|$|R
2500|$|A {{close friend}} of Weise {{described}} him as [...] "the only one I talked to about my problems. He was trustworthy, {{and he was always}} capable of understanding what I was going through". Other girls also said <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to him. Although Weise was sometimes described as a loner, several students said he had numerous friends. He had a notebook in which he drew what a close friend described as [...] "dark stuff".|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Go-Set was {{the only}} Australian {{newspaper}} or magazine dealing with teen issues and culture. Rival newspapers attacked Saddington's direct approach, and parents, on talk-back radio, challenged her answers as not being aimed at the correct age group: [...] "her readers {{were too young to}} understand the column". Saddington defended her writing with [...] "Obviously some people can't face reality". In 2002 she recalled [...] "one of the last things I wrote was that if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> more to their mothers then they wouldn't have to write to me".|$|E
60|$|When {{the king}} and his sons-in-law {{returned}} home <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> of nothing but the hero who had fought for them, and all wondered who he could be.|$|E
6000|$|Would he {{stop and}} accost them? At any rate this frightful silence must end. Mr. Lewisham sought {{in his mind}} for some remark {{wherewith}} to cover his employer's approach. He {{was surprised to find}} his mind a desert. He made a colossal effort. If <b>they</b> <b>could</b> only <b>talk,</b> if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> only seem at their ease! But this blank incapacity was eloquent of guilt. Ah! ...|$|R
50|$|MSC {{invited the}} press in to film the crew {{entering}} the chamber. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> to the press as they entered because they were wearing oxygen masks, but they did give a signed photo {{to one of the}} press that came out for the event. There were also a number of NASA officials there also.|$|R
2500|$|Mr. A.'s wife - Vera's mother - {{had died}} in 1967. In December 1969, when Vera was {{recovering}} from an illness, {{she glanced at her}} mother's framed photograph on the piano and wished <b>they</b> <b>could</b> still <b>talk.</b> With pen in hand Vera found herself writing - with difficulty - on the writing pad in front of her, [...] "I love you Vera." ...|$|R
6000|$|As they jogged along up {{the beach}} they talked {{together}} {{about the only thing}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> about--the treasure-box. [...] "And how big did you say 'twas?" [...] quoth the good gentleman.|$|E
60|$|He {{would tell}} her about the great good fortune that had befallen him; and about the {{beautiful}} mare, Little Bay, he had captured for her; and now <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> and plan endlessly, {{all the way down to}} Siccane.|$|E
60|$|At last {{their more}} tumultuous {{emotions}} subsided, and <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> again. She leant upon the wall, {{and he sat}} upon it {{so that he could}} keep an eye open for any returning dogs. Two, at any rate, were up on the hillside and keeping up a vexatious barking.|$|E
60|$|It {{was found}} that <b>they</b> {{understood}} and <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> a little Spanish, which Rance spoke fluently. After a short conversation, the guide {{thought that it would}} be quite safe to stay beside them. The encampment therefore was made, and supper prepared.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{keep myself}} from feeling {{sometimes}} that Frederic does take liberties with me," [...] the rector {{said to his}} sister. But he submitted. It {{was a part of}} the religion of the family,--and no little part,--that they should cling to their head and chief. What would the world have been to them if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> with comfortable ease and grace of their nephew Frederic? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think Miss Arrowpoint has {{the best}} manners I ever saw," [...] said Mrs. Davilow, when she and Gwendolen were in a dressing-room with Mrs. Gascoigne and Anna, but at a {{distance}} where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have their <b>talk</b> apart.|$|R
60|$|It {{is to be}} understood, as {{a matter}} of course, that our young people, being in parties of two and two, made the most solemn {{promises}} to keep together during the evening, and separated in ten minutes afterwards. Parties at Vauxhall always did separate, but 'twas only to meet again at supper-time, when <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> of their mutual adventures in the interval.|$|E
60|$|Roger gave Bathalda Cacama's {{message to}} the queen. While out in the market, he {{purchased}} a large packet of choice and delicate sweetmeats, of which he knew Amenche was particularly fond, and gave them to Bathalda; with the message that he would someday teach her to read and write, and then, when they were away from each other, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> at a distance.|$|E
60|$|The {{story of}} his own {{connection}} with the cabin had never been told him. The language of the apes had so few words that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> but little {{of what they had}} seen in the cabin, having no words to accurately describe either the strange people or their belongings, and so, long before Tarzan was old enough to understand, the subject had been forgotten by the tribe.|$|E
60|$|They {{were all}} {{to start on}} the {{following}} morning by break of day, and, therefore, the necessity of early rising gave them an excuse desired by all, for retiring early for the night. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> together, for every word that was spoken begot fresh sources of sorrow; <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not employ themselves, for their minds were unhinged and unfitted for employment; so they agreed that {{they would go to}} bed, and before nine o'clock, the family separated for the night.|$|R
50|$|While {{many think}} the album's title {{refers to the}} death of being a pop star, the Mississippian insisted that he and 9th chose this title so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not only <b>talk</b> about the album, but also the death of {{contemporary}} music.|$|R
5000|$|Casa Capșa is a {{historic}} restaurant in Bucharest, Romania, first established in 1852. At various times it has also included a hotel; most recently, it reopened as a 61-room hotel 17 June 2003. [...] "…long a symbol of Bucharest for its inhabitants… Capșa is not only associated with its exquisite pastry products, but also for a hectic literary life of yore… a welcoming place for Romanian writers where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> meet, <b>talk</b> and…associate." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{now they}} were very proud to {{think that one of}} their own number {{actually}} had frightened him, and they began to look on Buster Bear as a real hero. They tried in ever so many ways to show him how friendly they felt and went quite {{out of their way to}} do him favors. Whenever they met one another, all <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> about was the smartness and the greatness of Buster Bear.|$|E
6000|$|Their ways {{to their}} work lay {{together}} for a time. And now they found <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk.</b> Curiously enough, the worst of their depression seemed over now that they had actually donned the blue. Denton could talk with interest even {{of the work that}} lay before them. [...] "Whatever it is," [...] he said, [...] "it can't be so hateful as that hat shop. And after we have paid for Dings, we shall still have a whole penny a day between us even now. Afterwards--we may improve,--get more money." ...|$|E
60|$|All of the yearners {{read their}} poetry aloud, very superior, and {{rising in the}} inflections. It is {{probable}} that they made a living by taking in one another's literary washing. But they were ever so brave about their financial misfortunes, and <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> about the ballet Russe and also charlotte russes in quite the nicest way. Indeed {{it was a pretty}} sight to see them playing there on the lawn before the Mitchin mansion, talking about the novels they were going to write and the revolutions they were going to lead.|$|E
60|$|Despite his sufferings poor Wilkins rejoiced {{that night}} with his comrades at their good fortune, and it was long before he or <b>they</b> <b>could</b> cease to <b>talk</b> over future plans and take needful rest. At length Buckley rolled himself in his blanket, and lay down.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the boys}} {{arrived at the}} Simpson farm-house, after {{the close of the}} examination, there was very little <b>they</b> <b>could</b> do save <b>talk</b> over that which was to be done on the morrow, when the value of [...] "The Harnett" [...] was to be decided.|$|R
6000|$|No. One set {{of dishes}} {{followed}} {{another set of}} dishes, and nothing {{in the shape of}} a personal revelation took place. The conversation halted on irregularly, between public affairs on one side and trifling private topics on the other. Politics, home and foreign, took their turn with the small household history of St. Crux; the leaders of the revolution which expelled Louis Philippe from the throne of France marched side by side, in the dinner-table review, with old Mazey and the dogs. The dessert was put on the table, the old sailor came in, drank his loyal toast, paid his respects to [...] "Master George," [...] and went out again. Magdalen followed him, on her way back to the servants' offices, having heard nothing in the conversation of the slightest importance to the furtherance of her own design, from the first word of it to the last. She struggled hard not to lose heart and hope on the first day. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>talk</b> again to-morrow, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>talk</b> again the next day, of the French Revolution and the dogs. Time might do wonders yet; and time was all her own.|$|R
