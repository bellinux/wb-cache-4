SUBJECTS A screened cohort of 64 -year-old postmenopausal women with varying degrees of glucose tolerance, ranging from diabetes (n = 232), impaired (n = 212) and normal (n = 191) glucose tolerance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE ApoB / apoA-I ratio in relation to alcohol consumption and physical activity as assessed by questionnaires. RESULTS Alcohol consumption and regular physical activity at high levels were inversely associated with the serum apoB / apoA-I ratio independently of confounding factors such as obesity, lipid-lowering <b>treatment,</b> <b>degree</b> of glucose tolerance and hormone replacement therapy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acute {{pyelonephritis}} often leaves {{children with}} permanent renal scarring. AIMS: To compare {{the prevalence of}} scarring following initial treatment with antibiotics administered intravenously for 10 or three days. METHODS: In a prospective two centre trial, 220 patients aged 3 months to 16 years with positive urine culture and acute renal lesions on initial DMSA scintigraphy, {{were randomly assigned to}} receive intravenous ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg once daily) for 10 or three days, followed by oral cefixime (4 mg/kg twice daily) to complete a 15 day course. After three months, scintigraphy was repeated in order to diagnose renal scars. RESULTS: Renal scarring developed in 33 % of the 110 children in the 10 day intravenous group and 36 % of the 110 children in the three day group. Children older than 1 year had more renal scarring than infants (42 % (54 / 129) and 24 % (22 / 91), respectively). After adjustment for age, sex, duration of fever before <b>treatment,</b> <b>degree</b> of inflammation, presence of vesicoureteric reflux, and the patients' recruitment centres, {{there was no significant difference}} between the two treatments on renal scarring.

The aim of the {{research}} is to elucidate and analyze how societal services in practice are made available (or not available) and are utilized (or not utilized) by a group of individuals with traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCI). The first article is an inventory of Swedish societal support and services that one can apply for after a traumatic SCI. Twenty-five such forms are identified, which are primarily administered by two authorities: the local (municipal) authority and the social insurance office. The consumers expressed their frustration with this organization and the feelings of being checked up on and called into question. The second article analyzes how general ethical guidelines are challenged by situated ethics in the design context.

In addition, FML has been proven to be harmful because it is closely related to a variety of diseases such as diabetes. The qualitative analysis of FML in fresh and processed ginsengs was confirmed using HPLC-MS. Methods: An ion-pair reversed-phase LC method was used for the quantitative analysis of FML in various ginseng samples. Results: The contents of FML in the ginseng samples were 3. 35 – 42. 28  g/kg protein. The lowest value was observed in the freshly collected ginseng samples, and the highest value was found in the black ginseng concentrate. Heat treatment and honey addition significantly increased the FML content from 3. 35  g/kg protein to 42. 28  g/kg protein. Conclusion: These results indicate that FML is a promising indicator to estimate the heat <b>treatment</b> <b>degree</b> and honey addition level during the manufacture of ginseng products. The FML content is also an important parameter to identity the quality of ginseng products.

Seventy-four parameters (medical, social, type of investigation and <b>treatment,</b> <b>degree</b> of disability and of dependence) potentially associated with the length of stay were studied prospectively in 511 nonselected patients consecutively admitted to the Department {{over a period of}} 5 months. Each day spent on the wards was analyzed on a day-to-day basis and was classified into one of two groups: those due to a medical reason (4, 700 hospital days), and those due to a nonmedical reason (1, 184 days). These delays resulted chiefly from difficulties in obtaining laboratory investigations, especially in patients who were not disabled and who had been admitted for investigations (3. 8 % of hospital days, compared to 1. 5 % for patients with severe or total dependence) or from awaiting transfer to either another department or a nursing home. This second cause of delay markedly increased the length of stay of patients with severe or total dependence and with limited mobility on the first day (26. 0 days, compared with 7. 4 days for nondisabled patients) and, above all, on the last day spent in our Department (27. 0 days, compared with 8. 0 days).

Materials and methods: From 1994 to 2003, 28 patients underwent IAT due to middle cerebral artery occlusion (17 women and 11 men; median age, 69 years old). We evaluated the following prognostic parameters: institution of <b>treatment,</b> <b>degree</b> of paralysis at visit, size of high-intensity area on diffusion-weighted images, dose of intraarterial urokinase administration, elapsed time from symptom onset to completion of IAT, presence of penetration of embolus by microcatheter and microguidewire, recanalization after IAT, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) within 24 hours after IAT, and intravenous heparin administration after IAT. The outcome was evaluated at discharge and was classified into the following categories according to the modified Rankin Scale: independence (0 to 2), dependence (3 to 5), and death (6). Results: Seven patients were judged to be independent, 16 patients were judged to be dependent, and five patients died. Patients with recanalization after IAT had a better outcome than those without (p＜ 0. 05); patients with intracranial hemorrhage had a worse outcome than those without (p＜ 0. 05); and patients with intravenous heparin administration after IAT had a better outcome in activities of daily living than those without (p＜ 0. 05).

Materials and Methods: A total of 93 gastric cancer patients with relapse who entered from 21 March 2003 to 21 March 2007 to the cancer institute of Imam Khomeini Hospital (Tehran) were surveyed in this study.

In order to determine the relationship it has been necessary to work out a suitable calculation model.
