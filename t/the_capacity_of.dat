The TO 10 PA, TO 15 PA and TO 20 PA showed <b>the</b> <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> 83.1, 123.1 and 85.9  mAh g− 1 respectively which are 42, 44 and 34  % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial stage at a current rate of 20  mAg− 1.

5|$|A second project, {{the full}} {{duplication}} of the Cronulla branch line, {{was completed in}} 2010. This increases <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the branch line from four to eight trains per hour. The line between Oatley, Sutherland and Cronulla also received signalling upgrades to allow more services to run at shorter intervals.

5|$|Alan Stern and Harold F. Levison {{introduced}} a parameter Λ (lambda), expressing {{the likelihood of}} an encounter resulting in a given deflection of orbit.

This value can be used to estimate <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> a body to clear the neighbourhood of its orbit, where Λ > 1 will eventually clear it. A gap of five orders of magnitude in Λ was found between the smallest terrestrial planets and the largest asteroids and Kuiper belt objects.|$|E

Current plans do not call {{for it to be}} used by regular service, but instead to be used for non-revenue moves, and to provide a connection to the Jamaica Yard maintenance depot. The connection would allow for trains to run from the Financial District to Queens if <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Super-Express Bypass was built.|$|E
5|$|An {{area was}} set aside within {{the grounds for}} athletics, aptly named the Tower Athletic Ground.

5|$|Ancient Trader is a turn-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} played from a two-dimensional perspective.

The player explores the map to gather items, including tea, spices, and fruit, {{all of which can}} be found in wrecks. These can be exchanged for gold, which can be used to buy upgrades for the ship.

5|$|Anfield {{was built}} in 1884 on land {{adjacent}} to Stanley Park. It was originally used by Everton before the club moved to Goodison Park after a dispute over rent with Anfield owner John Houlding. Left with an empty ground, Houlding founded Liverpool in 1892 and the club has played at Anfield ever since. <b>The</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the stadium {{at the time was}} 20,000, although only 100 spectators attended Liverpool's first match at Anfield.|$|E

5|$|Honey {{bees are}} not {{native to the}} Americas, {{therefore}} their necessity as pollinators in the U.S. and other regions in the Western Hemisphere is limited to strictly agricultural/ornamental uses, as no native plants require honey bee pollination, except where concentrated in monoculture situations—where the pollination need is so great at bloom time that pollinators must be concentrated beyond <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> native bees (with current technology).|$|E
5|$|However, {{by then it}} {{had become}} clear that Frogner west of Solli plass would remain dominantly a {{residential}} area. The estimates showed that the station would capture few new riders and instead simply give a shorter walk for {{a small minority of}} those who used Nationaltheatret Station and Skøyen Station. With the upgraded Nationaltheatret Station, which opened in 1999, <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the Oslo Tunnel increased from 16 to 24 trains per hour in each direction, because the station from then had four, rather than two, tracks. A similar upgrade would need to be done for Elisenberg Station, should it be taken into use, or <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the tunnel would again be reduced. It is therefore highly unlikely that the station will ever be opened. In 1998, the readers of the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten proposed making Elisenberg an emergency exit.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Aston Villa {{moved into}} the Aston Lower Grounds, a sports ground in a Victorian {{amusement}} park in the former grounds of Aston Hall, a Jacobean stately home. The stadium has gone through various stages of renovation and development, resulting in the current stand configuration of the Holte End, Trinity Road Stand, North Stand and Doug Ellis Stand.
