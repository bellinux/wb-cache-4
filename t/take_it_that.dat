25|$|John Stuart Mill, the English thinker and politician, began a {{formative}} year visiting France {{at the age}} of 14 with {{a two-week}} stay at Pompignan in June 1820. In long letters to his father (who financed the educational trip), the precocious Mill details his extensive reading in the library of the chateau, including almost one work per day by Voltaire, Lefranc's main enemy, without once referring to the marquis' own works. Even by then something of a connoisseur of gardens, he walked in what he called the 'pleasure grounds' of the chateau almost every day, and sometimes to the plateau above (whose views he was to recall later, in other works), without ever giving any detail on the park itself. Mills was in Pompignan as a guest of Samuel Bentham, who was renting a property in the grounds, giving weight to the belief that the marquis (the second) was impecunious at that point. But we can <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the garden must have been in good order during Mill's visit, or he would have remarked on it.|$|E
500|$|As {{with many}} blues songs, Dixon's lyrics are {{ambiguous}} {{and may be}} seen on several levels. Interpretations of his verses range from the [...] "most overtly phallic song since Blind Lemon Jefferson's [...] 'Black Snake Moan'" [...] to an innocuous farm ditty. Although Dixon described it in the latter terms, he added, [...] "I wrote it as a barnyard song really, and some people even <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way!" [...] The lyrics are delivered in Howlin' Wolf's distinctive vocal style; music writer Bill Janovitz describes it as displaying a [...] "master singer's attention to phrasing and note choice, milking out maximum emotion and nuance from the melody".|$|E

According to Senator Johnson, [...] "The thing that alarms me is the philosophy which the entire country seems to be adopting, that if the risk is not good, let the government <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> <b>That</b> {{is nothing more than a}} refinement of the old thought that the world owes you a living." ...|$|E

60|$|He took flesh, therefore, {{because the}} {{children}} had it; he <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> he might die for the children; he <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> he might deliver the children from {{the works of the}} devil--'that he might deliver them.' No deliverance had come to the children if the Son of God had not taken their flesh and blood; therefore he took our flesh, that he might be our Saviour.|$|R

2500|$|On 22 March, Rory O'Connor held {{what was}} to become an infamous press conference and {{declared}} that the IRA would no longer obey the Dáil as (he said) it had violated its Oath to uphold the Irish Republic. He {{went on to say that}} [...] "we repudiate the Dáil ... We will set up an Executive which will issue orders to the IRA all over the country." [...] In reply to the question on whether this meant they intended to create a military dictatorship, O'Connor said: [...] "You can <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way if you like." ...|$|E
2500|$|Olivia {{restricted}} {{contact between}} the two after the trip. [...] Days before Pound was to leave for an extended stay in the US, Dorothy wrote him promising to abide by her mother's stricture and exhorting him to follow her lead: [...] "In case I do not see you alone on Wednesday, I <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> during your 'exile' you have been forbidden to write to me?.... if you have promised—don't break your word—don't write to me!" [...] Olivia allowed Dorothy to write a thank-you note when Pound's Canzoni were published—that he dedicated to Olivia and Dorothy—the only instance when she let Dorothy contact him directly. John Harwood, Olivia Sharkespear biographer, [...] writes that Dorothy's lack of resistance seems extreme, even by Edwardian standards; however, he speculates that Olivia's motives were to keep Dorothy's behaviour controlled, whereas Pound's behaviour was ignored.|$|E
2500|$|... "Scotland {{had lost}} both Tests against the All Blacks {{earlier in the}} season but the second, in Auckland, had been close: the Blacks just sneaked home by 21-18. Perhaps that persuaded people that, in the light of our Test series win over the French, we were favourites. Whoever made public that {{sentiment}} did us scant favour. We were lulled into {{a false sense of security}} and yet, on the day, we were also intimidated because we didn't play our natural game, preferring instead to sit back and wait for them to come at us. Also, we didn't kick well that day, particularly Michael Lynagh. I hardly saw the ball, and when I did I was clobbered. Not feeling the ball in my hands destroys me anyway; I cannot <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> <b>That</b> day we were more afraid of making a mistake, worrying about who we were playing against, rather than getting on with our own game. And when we did run it we were totally predictable. The Blacks knew the ball would head out to me when it was shifted, and so whenever I got it they hammed me." ...|$|E
