50|$|InPhase {{received}} over $58M {{in funding}} from New Venture Partners which controlled the Board from 2003 until 2010; InPhase received in aggregate over $100M in funding from strategic partners (Maxell, Hitachi LG Data Systems, Sanyo, Bayer Material Sciences, Imation) and other venture capital funds (Madison Dearborn, Signal Lake, Newton); Nelson Diaz as President and Steve Kitrosser as Chairman committed a major strategic blunder, driving InPhase to manufacture disk drives in high volume, when the target market was archival storage which required libraries with robots that shuttled {{large amounts of}} storage media between {{a relatively small number}} (e.g., two to four) of drives.

40|$|Can {{you imagine}} {{starting}} your car, pushing a button, and it drives you to work? This technology {{is not as}} far {{in the future as}} you may think. Cars such as Mercedes Benz’s S-class and Audi’s A 7 prototype have a traffic jam assist feature which at speeds under 40 mph, a button can be pressed and the car will drive itself on the highway. The system uses an array of cameras, sensors, and radars to follow the car in front at a safe distance while staying within its lane. If another car cuts in front of it with the feature active, the brakes will be automatically applied and the car will be again adjusted to follow at a safe distance. The driver can take control of vehicle by replacing his or her hand back on the steering wheel. This technology is not in your more common cars, but most new cars have automatic braking assistance, or object avoidance. These systems use sensors and radars to apply the brakes fully or partially to avoid an object or person that may be the in the vehicles path. Some systems have the ability to automatically steer around the obstruction. Because this technology is very recent and developing rapidly, automotive technician curriculums and simulators used to teach trouble shooting methods have not caught up. Though you can find these systems on most new cars and the automotive industry seems to be moving towards developing autonomous vehicles, there is no company currently manufacturing simulators equipped with this technology. Teaching students how to <b>trouble</b> <b>shoot</b> cars equipped with these systems presents a great challenge for automotive technician instructors. In an attempt to update its automotive curriculum to adapt to new technology, J Sergeant Reynolds Community College (JSRCC) ordered several new instructional simulators. These simulators use recent automotive technology, but are very limited in object detection or automatic braking. For Instance, the OEM light and accessory system with doors can do any lighting or door function of a Chevy Cobalt. The simulator is a unit equipped with Cobalt doors which open, it stands still and allows students to <b>trouble</b> <b>shoot</b> any of the lighting or Door functions of a Cobalt. The electronic system has preprogrammed bugs that students must <b>trouble</b> <b>shoot,</b> identify, and fix as a part of their training. JSRCC wants an actual vehicle that moves remotely, can be equipped with object detection, automatic breaking, and steering systems to give students a real life interactive instructional simulation. This will be a one of a kind instructional tool that will give students the ability to see these systems work, then by applying a preprogrammed bug the students will have to troubleshoot and repair the vehicle so that it is operating properly again. The plan in achieving this goal is to design a remote controlled chassis equipped with a steering and braking system. The chassis will have an override that can be integrated with an object detection/automatic braking system. The OEM light simulator will be attached to the chassis by permanent means. The completed instructional vehicle will be remote controlled and have all the lighting and door features of a Chevy Cobalt. It will also be able to be able to detect an object in front of it. If the object is big enough to cause damage to the car or harm to its passengers, the object detection system will override the remote and automatically apply the brakes stopping the vehicle. If the object can be cleared by a slight veer, the system will override the steering system to steer around the object while applying the brakes enough to complete this maneuver. The mechanical engineers on this project are specifically responsible for designing and manufacturing a remote controlled chassis with an electronic steering and braking scheme, attaching the OEM light and accessory simulator to the chassis, and incorporating an override of these systems for an object detection arrangement.

40|$|Advanced drop-in {{hydrocarbon}} biofuels require biofuel {{alternatives for}} refinery products other than gasoline. Candidate biofuels must have performance characteristics equivalent to conventional petroleum-based fuels. The technology pathways for biofuel alternatives {{also must be}} plausible, sustainable (e. g., positive energy balance, environmentally benign, etc.), and demonstrate a reasonable pathway to economic viability and end-user affordability. Viable biofuels technology pathways must address feedstock production and environmental issues through to the fuel or chemical end products. Potential end products include compatible replacement fuel products (e. g., gasoline, diesel, and JP 8 and JP 5 jet fuel) and other petroleum products or chemicals typically produced from a barrel of crude. Considering the complexity and technology diversity of a complete biofuels supply chain, no single entity or technology provider is capable of addressing in depth all aspects of any given pathway; however, all the necessary expert entities exist.

40|$|Appreciative inquiry can get {{you much}} better results than seeking out and solving problems.

And yet if we flip the coin, we have so much to be excited about. We are in the most dynamic and the most influential business of our times. We ought to be excited, motivated, and energized. We can be if we turn ourselves around and start looking at our jobs and ourselves differently. If we kill negative self-talk and celebrate our successes. If we dissect what we do right and apply the lessons to what we do wrong, we can solve our problems and re-energize the organization at the same time. In the long run what is likely to be more useful? Demoralizing a successful workforce by con-centrating on their failures or helping them over their last few hurdles by building a bridge with their successes? Don’t get me wrong.

40|$|The {{blast furnace}} (BF) that {{converts}} iron ore into molten iron {{is an important}} component in iron-steel making. An improvement of the blast furnace fuel efficiency contributes to the reduction of energy consumption in the steel industry because this process represents about 70 % of the total energy input to this industry. The goal of the research is to improve the competitive edge of steel mills by developing the advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model to optimize the gas and burden distributions inside a blast furnace for achieving the best gas utilization. A state-of-the-art 3 -D CFD model has been developed for simulating the gas distribution inside a blast furnace at given burden conditions, burden distribution and blast parameters. The comprehensive 3 -D CFD model has been validated by plant measurement data from an actual blast furnace. Validations of the sub-models are also achieved. ^ The burden distribution is direct related to efficiency and stable blast furnace operation. In this research, a mathematical model for estimating the burden distribution was developed with the combination of the falling curve sub-model, stock-line profile formation sub-model and burden descending sub-model. In a blast furnace, the burden descending velocity may be non-uniform along the radial direction due to the shaft angle and non-uniform consumption. The modifications on two existing burden descending models, i. e., geometric profile (GP) model and potential flow (PF) model are proposed to consider the non-uniform descending speed. The proposed non-uniform descending models are validated with published scaled blast furnace model results. Comparing to the original uniform descending model, the accuracy increases notably for the modified models with the non-uniform descending velocity. ^ The blast furnace burden consists of alternative layers of iron ore and coke. A novel methodology is proposed to efficiently model the effects of alternative burden layer structure on gas flow, heat transfer, mass transfer and chemical reactions. Different reactions and heat transfer characteristics are applied for difference types of layer. ^ In addition, the layered CFD model accurately predicts the Cohesive Zone (CZ) shape where the melting of solid burden taking place. The shape and location of the CZ are determined by an iterative method based on the ore temperature distribution. A new methodology has been developed to determine the location and shape of the CZ, based on the burden temperature distribution and composition. In addition, an under-relaxation scheme has been developed to obtain layered CZ shape which explicitly considered the layer structure inside the CZ. ^ The user friendly software package named Blast Furnace Shaft Simulator (BFSS) has been developed to simulate the blast furnace shaft process. The BFSS software package has been used for the optimization of burden and gas distributions to maximize gas utilization with proper furnace permeability for given burden materials, productivities, and blast furnaces; and also to optimize the burden and gas distributions for high fuel injection rate and low coke rate. The research has significant benefits to the steel industry with high productivity, low energy consumption, and improved environment. Using the BFSS, it is possible to design, optimize, and <b>trouble</b> <b>shoot</b> the blast furnace operation. ...|$|E
