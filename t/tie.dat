Inter Milan's Sandro Mazzola took the first penalty kick and scored. Dixie Deans took the next penalty, Celtic's first, but fired his shot over the crossbar.

40|$|Abstract. Despite many successes with teleoperated robotic {{surgical}} systems, some surgeons {{feel that}} the lack of haptic (force or tactile) feedback is detrimental in applications requiring fine suture manipulation. In this paper, we study the difference between applied suture forces in three knot <b>tying</b> exercises: hand <b>ties,</b> instrument <b>ties</b> (using needle drivers), and robot <b>ties</b> (using the da Vinci ™ Surgical System from Intuitive Surgical, Inc.). Both instrument and robot-assisted <b>ties</b> differ from hand <b>ties</b> in accuracy of applied force. However, only the robot <b>ties</b> differ from hand <b>ties</b> in repeatability of applied force. Furthermore, comparison between attendings and residents revealed statistically significant differences in the forces used during hand <b>ties,</b> although attendings and residents perform similarly when comparing instrument and robot <b>ties</b> to hand <b>ties.</b> These results indicate that resolved force feedback would improve robot-assisted performance during complex surgical tasks such as knot <b>tying</b> with fine suture. ...|$|R

Chris Willis stated this <b>tie</b> was {{not as bad as}} the previous weeks because the Athletics had old players from the Akron Indians, a winning team in the Ohio League.|$|E

5|$|In {{swimming}} {{there was}} a three-way <b>tie</b> in the men's 100m freestyle event, and three bronze medals were awarded; a <b>tie</b> for {{second place in the}} women's 100m freestyle event meant that no bronze was awarded.

A <b>tie</b> for first place in the pommel horse resulted in two gold medals, and thus no silver was awarded; a <b>tie</b> for third place in the horizontal bar, pommel horse, rings, women's vault and women's floor exercises meant that two bronzes were awarded for each event. A four-way <b>tie</b> for second position in the parallel bars meant that no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E

5|$|Initially given a blue color scheme, the <b>TIE</b> fighter {{models for}} the first film were grey to better film against a bluescreen; <b>TIE</b> fighters in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) shifted {{back to being a}} muted blue. Sound {{designer}} Ben Burtt created the distinctive <b>TIE</b> fighter sound effect by combining an elephant call with a car driving on wet pavement. Combat scenes between <b>TIE</b> fighters and the Millennium Falcon and Rebel Alliance X-wing fighters in Star Wars were meant to be reminiscent of World War II dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as placeholders while Industrial Light & Magic completed the movie's special effects. Darth Vader's distinct <b>TIE</b> advanced X1 in Star Wars was designed to make it instantly recognizable, and the <b>TIE</b> interceptors developed for Jedi were designed to look fast, deadly, and frightening.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} <b>tying</b> the <b>ties</b> is also different, with women's hakama being <b>tied</b> in a simpler knot or a bow. As with men's hakama, the front <b>ties</b> are first {{brought to the}} back, then to the front, then <b>tied</b> at the back in a knot. Then the back himo are brought around to the front. At this point, they may be <b>tied</b> with a bow at the left hip, {{just in front of}} the opening, with the ends of the <b>ties</b> at equal lengths. For more secure fastening, the <b>ties</b> may be wrapped once at center front, then <b>tied</b> inside at the back.|$|R

5|$|This {{discrepancy}} is {{also caused}} by ties. In men's artistic gymnastics, a three-way <b>tie</b> {{for the gold}} medal in the horizontal bar meant that no silver and bronze medals were awarded; in the pommel horse, rings and parallel bars ties for first positions resulted in two golds per event, and thus no silvers were awarded; and a <b>tie</b> for silver in the individual all-around resulted in no bronze being awarded. In women's artistic gymnastics, ties for {{the gold medal in}} the uneven bars and floor meant that no silvers were awarded for those events. In athletics, a three-way <b>tie</b> in the men's high jump, and ties in the men's 3,000m steeplechase and the women's high jump for second place meant that no bronzes were awarded for those events. In men's bowling, a <b>tie</b> for second place in the singles and trios resulted in two silver medals per event, and thus no bronzes were awarded; a <b>tie</b> for the bronze-medal position in the doubles and the team of five meant that two bronzes were awarded for each event. In softball, due to rainy weather at the final competition the ranking was decided by the results of the preliminary round and semifinals. Japan was awarded the gold medal based on its unbeaten record in the preliminary games; China and Chinese Taipei shared the silver. Those two were to have played to decide who would meet Japan in the gold-medal game. In swimming, a <b>tie</b> for first position in the men's 50m freestyle resulted in two gold medals and no silver was awarded; a <b>tie</b> for second position in the women's 100m freestyle meant that no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E

5|$|While no {{official}} knot exists for tying the two {{ends of the}} thong together, the decorative diamond knot {{has become the most}} common.

5|$|A {{total of}} 609 medals (202 gold, 199 silver and 208 bronze) were awarded. The {{total number of}} bronze medals {{is greater than the}} total number of gold or silver medals because two bronze medals were awarded per event in boxing (except men's light heavyweight and heavyweight categories). In +100kg {{category}} of freestyle wrestling, a <b>tie</b> for the first position in between the wrestlers of Iran and Japan meant that no silver medal was awarded. In gymnastics, a <b>tie</b> for second place in the parallel bars event resulted in two silver medals and thus no bronze was awarded, similarly a <b>tie</b> for first place in the uneven bars event meant that no silver medal was awarded.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{environmental}} benefits of using recycled material, plastic <b>ties</b> usually replace timber <b>ties</b> soaked in creosote, the latter being a toxic chemical, and are themselves recyclable. Hybrid plastic railroad <b>ties</b> and composite <b>ties</b> are used in other rail applications such as underground mining operations, industrial zones, humid environments and densely populated areas. Hybrid railroad <b>ties</b> are also used to be partly exchanged with rotten wooden <b>ties,</b> which will result in continuous track stiffness. Hybrid plastic <b>ties</b> and composite <b>ties</b> also offer benefits on bridges and viaducts, because they lead to better distribution of forces and reduction of vibrations into respectively bridge girders or the ballast.
