5|$|After Tom {{has lived}} with the St. Clares for two years, Eva grows very ill. Before she dies she {{experiences}} a vision of heaven, which she shares with <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> her. As {{a result of her}} death and vision, the other characters resolve to change their lives, with Ophelia promising to throw off her personal prejudices against blacks, Topsy saying she will better herself, and St. Clare pledging to free Tom.|$|E
5|$|Balzac {{concerned}} himself overwhelmingly {{with the}} darker essence {{of human nature}} and the corrupting influence of middle and high societies. His mission was to observe humankind in its most representative state, frequently wandering through the streets incognito among the masses of Parisian society to undertake his research. He used incidents from his life and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> him, in works like Eugénie Grandet and Louis Lambert.|$|E
5|$|Representations of the city, countryside, and {{building}} interiors {{are essential to}} Balzac's realism, often serving to paint a naturalistic backdrop before which the characters' lives follow a particular course; this gave him a reputation as an early naturalist. Intricate details about locations sometimes stretch for fifteen or twenty pages. As he did with <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> him, Balzac studied these places in depth, traveling to remote locations and comparing notes {{that he had made}} on previous visits.|$|E

5|$|As The World Ends with You {{focuses on}} the {{character}} of Neku Sakuraba, {{in order to create a}} believable story the developers put a lot of focus on his development, such as how he would feel, what thoughts lie behind his actions, how he interacted with other characters, and how <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> him feel about him. The developers included aspects and daily concerns, hoping that they could be things that players would have to deal with their personal lives and therefore would let them relate with Neku.|$|E
5|$|As a hermit, Withers {{lives in}} solitude. He does not own {{a car or}} television; he gets his news from <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> him and gets around on a bicycle that he found, broken, {{on the side of}} the road. Though he has an open-door policy for people that come to visit him, he himself visits family only twice a year. He does have a computer, which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email. To earn his food and {{clothing}} allowance, which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, Withers makes pottery to sell and works one day a week for a scientific-instrument company. At the end of each year, he donates any funds that remain to charity.|$|E
5|$|Her {{most infamous}} antic was giving Ozy a haircut only to accidentally shave off all his fur. Although she is {{normally}} manic, {{she also has}} a strong sense of justice, facing the inexplicable wrongs of life and the world she sees. However, her rebellions are mostly limited to annoying her mother, playing jokes on Ozy and disrupting the peace at school. None of which matters any less to her, as long as she has fun doing it. Millie says aloud what others think, and does what others, for fear of reaction from <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> them, would not dare. She, like Ozy, often tries to answer the most important questions in life, but her method of finding the answers makes her unique.|$|E

Nahuatl is still spoken today by over 1.5 million people.|$|R

5|$|An away team boards the cube, {{discovering}} that either {{an accident or}} another species disabled the vessel. They take a Borg drone back onto Voyager, where the Doctor (Robert Picardo) accidentally revives it. After being told by Frazier to remain where he is, Chakotay breaks {{out of his room}} where he sees that all <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> him on the alien planet possess Borg implant technology in their bodies. Frazier explains that an electro-kinetic storm broke their link with the Borg hive mind. Instead, the separated drones settled on a nearby planet. Chakotay's health gets worse, and the ex-Borg offer to connect him to a joint mind to heal his injuries, and he reluctantly accepts. Once part of the hive mind, he sees a montage of their memories. After Voyager arrives, Frazier and her group want Janeway to re-activate the neuroelectric generator on the damaged cube to extend a new joint mind across the entire planet.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{had much}} money, so they {{determined}} to fund themselves by collecting and selling fine specimens {{of birds and}} insects. Both made extensive travels — {{in different parts of}} the Amazon basin — creating large natural history collections, especially of insects. Wallace sailed back to England in 1852 after four years; on the voyage, his ship caught fire, and his collection was destroyed; undeterred, he set out again, leading eventually (1869) to a comparable book, The Malay Archipelago. By the time he came home in November 1859, Bates had collected over 14,000 species, of which 8,000 were new to science. His observations of the coloration of butterflies led him to describe what is now called Batesian mimicry, where an edible species protects itself by appearing like a distasteful species. Bates's account of his stay, including observations of nature and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> him, occupies his book.|$|E
5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> him who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E
