40|$|Boron {{addition}} {{has been}} used to refine the microstructures in TiAl castings, such as LPT blades, to improve ductility. However, boride precipitates with undesired morphologies could reduce ductility and even wipe out the entire benefit from grain refinement. Boride morphology in Ti 45 Al 2 Mn 2 Nb 1 B was found to be closely related to solidification conditions and proper processing windows have been established. In order to improve temperature capability of cast TiAl alloys to cater for the demand in new engines TiAl alloys have to be alloyed with more refractory elements, such as Nb and Ta, which will inevitably affect the boride morphologies. In this study variant alloys based on Ti 45 Al 2 Mn 2 Nb 1 B have been investigated with emphasis on the relationship between boride morphology, alloying element species and cooling conditions and distinctly different boride formation behaviour in different alloys was observed. In addition, curvy borides were found both on the fracture surface and within the microstructure in <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> <b>pieces,</b> especially in Hf-containing <b>test</b> <b>pieces,</b> which indicate that curvy borides have the strongest effect in reducing ductility regardless of alloy composition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAluminum allay A 6061 is {{commonly}} applied T 6 heat treatment and {{ultimate tensile strength}} above 300 MPa is obtained by solid solution strengthening. The T 6 treatment consists of solution treatment, water quenching and artificial aging. Lower cooling rate during quenching is very important because impurity phase deposition in solution phasedue to longer quenching delay results in growth of grains in the aging process and less strengthening. The quenching delay time strongly depends on boiling transition from film boiling to nucleate boiling as well as heat capacity of the solid. Stable wetted situation hardly occurs in the film boiling region and film boiling heat transfer coefficient is one or two digit {{lower than that of}} the nucleate boilingheat transfer. In this research, dip (bath) and spray quenches were applied to thick A 6061 hollow cylinders to get comparable spray cooling rate with the conventional dip quenching. Temperature histories in the cylinder were measured during quenching and inside temperature distribution was estimated with inverse heat conduction analysis. After the T 6 treatment, <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> were cut away from the cylinder and effectiveness of the spray quench was accessed. The spray quenchingtests were done for water temperature of 10 - 22 oC and the maximum total spray flow rate of 20 L/min with four or eight spray nozzles around the cylinder. For the dip quenching, <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> was soaked into well stirred water pool at a fixed temperature of 18 oC. From the spray quenchtests, the quenching delay time was difficult to keep within the allowable maximum delay time requested from existing metallurgical studies. It was found that higher water flow rate or larger number of nozzle arrangement will be required to obtain comparable cooling rate with the dip quenching result. However, each <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> showed that the strength of spray quenched materials is almost equivalent to that of dip quenching and satisfied the minimum tensile strength of A 6061 -T 6 regulated by JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards) B 8270...|$|R

In addition, hydrolytic degradation in sterile buffer at temperatures ranging from 4 to 55 degrees C was monitored for 98 days. Degradation was measured through loss of weight (surface erosion), molecular weight, and mechanical strength. While no weight loss was recorded in sterile buffer, samples incubated in soils were degraded at an erosion rate of 0. 03 to 0. 64 % weight loss per day, depending on the polymer, the soil, and the incubation temperature. The erosion rate was enhanced by incubation at higher temperatures, {{and in most cases}} the copolymer lost weight at a higher rate than the homopolymer. The molecular weights of samples incubated at 40 degrees C in soils and those incubated at 40 degrees C in sterile buffer decreased at similar rates, while the molecular weights of samples incubated at lower temperatures remained almost unaffected, indicating that molecular weight decrease is due to simple hydrolysis and not to the action of biodegrading microorganisms. The degradation resulted in loss of mechanical properties. From the samples used in the biodegradation studies, 295 dominant microbial strains capable of degrading P (3 HB) and the poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate) copolymer in vitro were isolated and identified.

40|$|Ti- 5 Al- 5 V- 5 Mo- 3 Cr (Ti 5553, in wt%) is a {{recently}} developed metastable β titanium alloy, {{specifically designed to}} replace Ti- 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al (VT 22) {{in the manufacture of}} large airplane components. The studies of Ti 5553 have drawn the attention of many researchers. Ti 5553 shows reasonable weldability and can be welded autogenously (without filler metal). Most of the previous studies were directed at forged material behaviour. There is still a lack of understanding of the microstructure evolution and the phase transformation in regards both similar and dissimilar welded material. The main part of this study investigates the microstructure evolution and phase transformation of Ti 5553 -Ti 5553 similar weldment upon various post weld heat treatment (PWHT). The microstructure analysis was carried out by optical, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron transmission microscopy (TEM). Microstructural results show that the weld zone in Ti 5553 can retain the β phase in the as-welded condition. SEM micrographs reveal the different morphology and growth rate of the α precipitation at 500 ℃ and 600 ℃ ageing temperature. TEM results in the fusion zone (FZ) area of an as-welded (AW) specimen show the diffraction patterns of the ω phase. This ω phase was retained as athermal ω_a which formed during cooling from the welding process. All evidence proved that ω_a in the weld zone improved the precipitation rate. However, there was no evidence for an isothermal ω at a 500 ℃ ageing temperature. The volume fraction and size of α precipitates have a major influence on hardness and tensile strength. At around 30 mins of ageing time at either temperature, the α platelets reached an equilibrium of precipitation and hence had the highest volume fraction which resulted in the highest tensile strength. Increasing the ageing time resulted in the α laths coarsening, especially for samples aged at 600 ℃. The coarsened α laths caused a decrease in hardness. However, changes in tensile strength were not significant. Most of the fractures occurred in the FZ. Fractographic analysis showed dimple rupture via microvoid coalescence for all <b>tensile</b> <b>tested</b> <b>pieces.</b> Investigation on AW dissimilar welding Ti 5553 -Ti 64 and Ti 5553 -CPTi suggested that Ti 5553 is weldable to the most common titanium alloys (Ti 64 & CPTi) and with reasonable tensile strength.

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to improve the {{efficiency}} of gas turbines by improving the usage of the mechanical and thermal strength of the materials. This was achieved by investigations to get a better understanding of materials behaviour under high mechanical and thermal loads. Three materials for aero-engines applications were studied: Ti 6246 (a high strength titanium alloy), PWA 1484 (a single crystal nickel-base alloy) and M 247 (a conventionally cast nickel-base alloy). Investigations performed on Ti 6246 included <b>tensile</b> <b>tests,</b> creep tests, LCF and HCF tests on notched and un-notched <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> as well as special tests to characterise fretting fatigue behaviour and manufacturing effects (influence of surface conditions on the cyclic life). The results indicate that, in many respects, the strength of Ti 6246 is superior to that of alternative titanium alloys such as Ti 64 or Ti 6242. The characterisation of PWA 1484 included <b>tensile</b> <b>tests</b> at constant deformation rate, conventional creep tests as well as isothermal fatigue and thermo-mechanical fatigue tests.

To carry out this experiment, suitable casting conditions, with which grey iron should be taken in the as-cast condition, were picked out, and the <b>test</b> <b>pieces,</b> JIS 8 C type <b>tensile</b> strength <b>test</b> <b>pieces,</b> were casted using two kinds of cast iron mold which has respectively mold ratio 6. 5 and 9. 0. The mold were coated with two layers of coating material, diatomaceous earth and soot. Irons, about 3 kg, were melted in a high frequency induction furnace at about 1450 ℃ with alumina crucible and were poured into the mold at 1300 ℃, after　being　inoculated　at　 1450 ℃ with 0. 3 % Ca-Si. Chemical composition of irons was adjusted to have required the degree of eutectic saturatio (Sc), 0. 85 to 1. 05, by the addition of low carbon steel to the base iron containing 3. 79 %C, 2. 20 %Si, 0. 44 %Mn, 0. 12 %P, 0. 05 %S. For purpose of reference, <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> with same type were casted into green sand mold. The results obtained are as follows: (1) The microstructure of the permanent mold cast iron with a grey fracture in the as-cast condition is composed of ferritic and pearlitic matrix containing eutectic and fine flaky graphite, and higher Sc is, more the ferrite among the matrix becomes. (2) Strength of the permanent mold cast iron is better than that of the sand mold casting with same Sc:the tensile strength and the hardness of the permanent mold cast iron is respectively 24 to 32 kg/mm＾ 2) and 220 to 260 Hv(20). Density of the permanent mold cast iron is higher than that of green sand mold cast iron. (3) In case of grey iron permanent molding,it is necessary to select the chemical composition and the cooling conditions to keep away from tending to be white or mottled cast iron, and hence it tends to have similar structure and mechanical properties. Therefore,it will be recommended,in case of permanent mold casting,to controll strictly the casting conditions using the iron with higher Sc which has less chilling tendency.

However, neither a methodology nor an exact micro mechanical property has been well determined. Hence, several experiments are carried out in this research to point out the influence of “size effect”.

In order to find the mechanical properties in micro scale, this study shows the effect of specimen size and grain size on the micro <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> of copper material.

Since the minimum standard <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> formulated in ASTM is still too big for this micro <b>tensile</b> <b>test,</b> this study decided to shrink the sample size of specimen shape to 1 / 2.

Tabs made from composite of graphite and PMR- 15 polyimide enable high-temperature <b>tensile</b> <b>testing</b> of flat coupons of ceramic-matrix composites. Also used in high-temperature <b>tensile</b> <b>testing</b> of flat coupons of ceramics, metals, and metal-matrix composites...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} predict necking and {{fracture}} phenomena, a crystal plasticity model is {{introduced in the}} finite element analysis of <b>tensile</b> <b>tests.</b> Grains having different orientations are subjected to numerical <b>tensile</b> <b>tests.</b> A damage model is also proposed to predict the sudden drop of load carrying capacity after necking and to reflect the void nucleation and growth on the severely deformed region. From the analyses of <b>tensile</b> <b>test,</b> the necking and fracture phenomena are well predicted...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} tensile {{behavior}} of commingled polypropylene/glass yarns at different testing speed. A protocol to perform yarn <b>tensile</b> <b>tests</b> is defined and tests {{are carried out}} on yarns before and after weaving (yarns extracted from the fabric) in order to characterize the weaving damage. A protocol is also defined to perform <b>tensile</b> <b>tests</b> on 3 Dfabrics. The tensile behavior of a 3 D-fabric made of commingled yarns is investigated and results are compared with yarn <b>tensile</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
