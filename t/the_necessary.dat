Some might accept the proof for <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> existent while rejecting the other arguments; such a critic could still reject the existence of God. Another type of criticism might attack the proof of <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> existent itself. Such a critic might reject Avicenna's conception of contingency, a starting point in the original proof, {{by saying that the}} universe could just happen to exist without being necessary or contingent on an external cause.|$|E
