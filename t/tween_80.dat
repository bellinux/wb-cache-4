MTT and LDH assays were used as cytotoxic assays. In general, the cytotoxicity of nanoparticle-bound doxorubicin (Dox) was enhanced compared to the free drug in solution. However, responses of the cell lines towards the drug effects were different. In the case of free Dox in solution, this difference correlated with different intracellular concentrations of Dox, which in turn, depended {{on the level of}} P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression in these cell lines. Accordingly, the 9 L gliosarcoma (GS- 9 L) cells, which appeared to be most resistant towards Dox, were characterized by the highest P-gp expression. Additionally, the influence of surfactants on the cytotoxic effect was investigated at different Dox concentrations. It was shown that the presence of polysorbate <b>80</b> (<b>Tween</b> (R) <b>80)</b> in the nanoparticle formulation significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity, whereas poloxamer 188 (Pluronic (R) F 68) and poloxamine 908 (Tetronic (R) 908) had a negligible influence...|$|R

Este fosfolipídeo é encontrado em abundância nas membranas celulares e, juntamente com a fosfatidiletanolamina, somam mais de 75 % do total de fosfolipídeos presentes nestas. A PC vem sendo utilizada em clínicas dermatológicas, de estética e emagrecimento, pois, parece ser eficaz para eliminar gordura localizada, em especial no abdome, quadril, joelhos, pescoço e pálpebras inferiores. Este trabalho teve por objetivo, estudar os efeitos da PC solubilizada em diferentes compostos (deoxicolato de sódio, etanol, detergente Tween® 80 e albumina) sobre os adipócitos epididimais isolados de ratos machos da linhagem Wistar. Atualmente, não há estudos científicos conclusivos liberando o seu uso farmacológico e, portanto, há a necessidade de mais pesquisas que definam seus mecanismos de ação. Para atingirmos o objetivo proposto, utilizou-se o método de isolamento e contagem dos adipócitos e também a determinação do glicerol no meio de incubação. Sendo assim, o tratamento que obteve maior quantidade de glicerol produzido foi o Tween® 80 e Tween® 80 + PC no tempo de incubação de 15 minutos e o DS + PC no tempo de incubação de 30 minutosAbstract:The {{phosphatidylcholine}} (PC) has severa {{effects on}} the human body.

In this study, we observe the accumulation of edelfosine in brain tissue after its oral administration in Compritol (R) and Precirol (R) lipid nanoparticles (LN). The high accumulation of edelfosine in brain was due to the inhibition of P-glycoprotein by <b>Tween</b> (R) <b>80,</b> as verified using a P-glycoprotein drug interaction assay. Moreover, these LN were tested in vitro against the C 6 glioma cell line, which was later employed to establish an in vivo xenograft mouse model of glioma. In vitro studies revealed that edelfosine-loaded LN induced an antiproliferative effect in C 6 glioma cell line. In addition, in vivo oral administration of drug-loaded LN in NMRI nude mice bearing a C 6 glioma xenograft tumor induced a highly significant reduction in tumor growth (p< 0. 01) 14 days after the beginning of the treatment. Our results showed that <b>Tween</b> (R) <b>80</b> coated Compritol (R) and Precirol (R) LN can effectively inhibit the growth of C 6 glioma cells in vitro and suggest that edelfosine-loaded LN represent an attractive option for the enhancement of antitumor activity on brain tumors in vivo.
