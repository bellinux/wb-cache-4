[...] Seven months earlier, on September 7, 2011, in a message on Twitter, the 70-year-old Diamond {{announced}} his engagement to the 41-year-old McNeil. Diamond said that his 2014 album Melody Road was fueled by his relationship with McNeil, explaining: [...] "There's no better inspiration or motivation for work than being in love. It's what you dream of as a creative person. I was able to complete this album – start it, write it and complete it – {{under the spell of}} love, and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> somehow." [...] In addition to serving as Diamond's manager, McNeil produced the documentary Neil Diamond: Hot August Nights NYC.|$|E
2500|$|While [...] Catholic Republican leaders {{try to stay}} in {{line with}} the teachings of the Catholic Church on {{subjects}} such as abortion, euthanasia, embryonic stem cell research and same-sex marriage, they differ on the death penalty and contraception. [...] Pope Francis' 2015 encyclical Laudato si' sparked a discussion on the positions of Catholic Republicans in relation to the positions of the church. The pope's encyclical on behalf of the Catholic Church officially acknowledges a man-made climate change caused by burning fossil fuels. The Pope says the warming of the planet is rooted in a throwaway culture and the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet in pursuit of short-term economic gains. According to The New York Times, Laudato si put pressure on the Catholic candidates in the 2016 election: Jeb Bush, Bobby Jindal, Marco Rubio, and Rick Santorum. [...] With leading Democrats praising the encyclical, James Bretzke, a professor of moral theology at Boston College, has said that both sides were being disingenuous: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> that both the Republicans and the Democrats... like to use religious authority and, in this case, the Pope to support positions they have arrived at independently... There is a certain insincerity, a hypocrisy I think, on both sides." [...] While a Pew Research poll indicates Catholics are more likely to believe the Earth is warming than non-Catholics, 51% of Catholic Republicans believe in global warming (less than the general population), and only 24% of Catholic Republicans believe global warming is caused by human activity.|$|E

60|$|LORD DARLINGTON. [Still seated L.C.] Oh, {{nowadays}} so many conceited {{people go}} about Society {{pretending to be}} good, that I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> rather a sweet and modest disposition {{to pretend to be}} bad. Besides, there is this to be said. If you pretend to be good, the world takes you very seriously. If you pretend to be bad, it doesn't. Such is the astounding stupidity of optimism.|$|E

"Your pardon Mr. Howel; I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows,</b> {{according}} to your own admission, that his wit, or rather its wit, for there is no his about it--that its wit is of a very indifferent quality as witticisms even; that it is ignorant of what it pretends to know; and that its opinions are no better than its knowledge: all of which, when fairly established against one who, by his very pursuit, professes to know more than other people, {{is very much like}} making it appear contemptible." ...|$|E

"I like dancing, I {{can assure}} you, {{where there is}} room to dance; but I don't call it dancing {{when you have an}} area of only a foot square to dance in, and are hustled and bumped more than you would be in a crowded Lord Mayor's show. My {{training}} has not suited me for it, and I would rather stand and look on, listen to scraps of conversation, watch the faces of the dancers and of those standing round. It is a study, and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> one of the worst sides of nature. It is quite shocking to see and hear the envy, uncharitableness, the boredom, and the desperate efforts to look cheerful under difficulties, especially among the girls that do not get partners." ...|$|E
5000|$|On November 7, Scott Rasmussen told Slate's David Weigel, [...] "In general, the {{projections}} were pretty good. The two differences I noted were share of white vote falling to 72 percent. That’s what the Obama campaign, to their credit, said all along. We <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> just over 73 percent. Also, youth turnout higher and senior turnout lower than expected. That’s {{a pretty big}} deal given {{the size of the}} generation gap. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> clearly that the Obama team had a great game plan for identifying their vote and getting it to the polls." ...|$|R

5000|$|Reviewing the {{documentary}} for BBC Radio 4's In Touch, the opera singer Denise Leigh, who is herself visually impaired was generally positive about <b>it.</b> [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> broke down barriers, I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was ground breaking {{in any sense}} at all, but I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> that there are less divisions between the blind teenage community adolescents - {{whatever you want to}} call them - and the sighted college community." [...] On the same programme, the Time Out television critic Alkarim Jivani said [...] "... I feel that the great thing about this documentary, if there is one distinguishing factor of good documentaries, it makes us feel that there's less that divides from each other than joins us." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, {{every now}} and then, and indeed {{surprisingly}} often, Christ finds a word that transcends all common-place morality; {{every now and}} then he quits the beaten track to pioneer the unexpressed, and throws out a pregnant and magnanimous hyperbole; for it is only by some bold poetry of thought that men can be strung up above the level of everyday conceptions to take a broader look upon experience or accept some higher principle of conduct. To a man who is of the same mind that was in Christ, who stands at some centre not too far from his, and looks at the world and conduct from some not dissimilar or, at least, not opposing attitude—or, shortly, to a man who is of Christ’s philosophy—every such saying should come home with a thrill of joy and corroboration; he should feel each one below his feet as another sure foundation in the flux of time and chance; each should be another proof that in the torrent of the years and generations, where doctrines and great armaments and empires are swept away and swallowed, he stands immovable, holding by the eternal stars. But alas! at this juncture of the ages it is not so with us; on each and every such occasion our whole fellowship of Christians falls back in disapproving wonder and implicitly denies the saying. Christians! the farce is impudently broad. Let us stand up in the sight of heaven and confess. The ethics that we hold are those of Benjamin Franklin. Honesty is the best policy, is perhaps a hard saying; it is certainly one by which a wise man of these days will not too curiously direct his steps; but I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> a glimmer of meaning to even our most dimmed intelligences; I think we perceive a principle behind it; I think, without hyperbole, we are of the same mind that was in Benjamin Franklin.|$|E

Of the milestone, Glasgow City head coach Eddie Wolecki Black said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> remarkable consistently she {{has managed to}} rack up 100 starts for the club {{in such a short}} period of time.
