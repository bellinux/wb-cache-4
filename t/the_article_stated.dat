5|$|In 1930 the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} the West Indies which included four Test matches—the first Tests to be played in the West Indies. The MCC side was not at full international strength; it included players who were either just beginning or just ending their international careers, and several star English bowlers were missing. The first Test was played in Barbados and St Hill was selected, making his debut for the West Indies on 11 February 1930. He scored 0 and 12 with the bat, took two for 110 from 35 overs in the first innings and was wicketless in the second. The match was drawn. The MCC then travelled to Trinidad and played the cricket team in two games. St Hill played in the first, taking four wickets, but was rested from the second. The Trinidad Sporting Chronicle stated that he was omitted specifically to be ready for the second Test, also played in Trinidad, although he had not asked for a rest. The newspaper questioned why he had then been left out of the team for the Test match, and reported speculation that his omission was for political reasons to discredit the leadership of George Dewhurst, the Trinidad captain in the second game. It suggested that, given his ability with bat and ball, St Hill was worth a net 100 runs to any team in which he played. Having been omitted from the second Test, which West Indies lost, St Hill played in the third in British Guiana. West Indies won the game; St Hill batted at number eleven in the batting order in his first innings, at number five in the second and scored three runs in each innings. With the ball, he took only one wicket and did not play another Test. A review of the series in the Barbados Advocate suggested that St Hill bowled steadily during both his Test appearances, but that his economical bowling figures in British Guiana were slightly unrepresentative as the English batsmen had been concentrating entirely on defence. <b>The</b> <b>article</b> <b>stated</b> that St Hill was more effective on matting pitches than on turf, but that he had many supporters in Trinidad. It believed he warranted a place on the forthcoming West Indian tour of Australia, but that he needed to work on his fielding, which was weak.|$|E

The doping calendar indicates use of EPO, growth hormone, testosterone, blood doping, and insulin on 114 days over seven months during the 2003 season. The racing program correlates with Hamilton's races in 2003, according to Politiken. The calendar includes two blood transfusions during the Tour de France. “The first time before the three stages in the Alps and the second before the 12th stage – a 47 km individual time trial,” write the reporters. <b>The</b> <b>article</b> <b>stated</b> that such an ambitious program would have required assistance – “at least four or five people,” according to Damsgaard.|$|E

500|$|In February 1896, Hogan {{received}} {{an offer to}} manage the Youngstown (Ohio) Puddlers, a minor league team associated with the Interstate League.

[...] The paper went on to quote an article that supposedly appeared in the Cincinnati-based Commercial Gazette: [...] "St. Louis fans {{are opposed to the}} idea of selling Marty Hogan, the fast out-fielder, who played with the Indianapolis team last season, having been loaned by the Browns". [...] In the spring of 1896, however, Hogan attempted to extricate himself from remaining contractual obligations to the St. Louis Browns. [...] Sporting Life reported, in May 1896, that Hogan was unsuccessful in his efforts to obtain a final release from the Browns, who retained him as an [...] "extra" [...] right fielder. [...] "Marty has not been given any kind of trial by the manager of the Browns, although he stood high in batting and base running in the Western League last year", <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>stated.</b> [...] "He is in fine condition, and is anxious to play, but does not prepare to be shifted about at the will of alleged managers". [...] The paper added that Hogan had returned to St. Louis in March 1896, prepared to [...] "purchase" [...] his release, [...] "but he has been held onto until now, when he could have secured $1550 for his services in the Western League". [...] Hogan appeared especially confident of his baserunning abilities. [...] The article noted that the outfielder had [...] "offered to match himself to run 100 yards for $500 a side against any player in the National League". [...] Meanwhile, his batting evidently continued to improve. On May 24, 1896, an article in the St. Paul (Minnesota) Globe indicated Hogan performed exceptionally well at the bat during a contest between the Hoosiers and the St. Paul Saints. [...] "Marty Hogan...through an inadvertent mix-up of pugilism and baseball...tried to hammer the face off the ball, which had tantalized the other Hoosiers", <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>stated,</b> [...] "and when Marty's work was done, the ball was out of the lot and he was on second base".|$|E

[...] "The incorporators of the club will be Thomas McDonald, Joseph McDonald, Thomas Carr, Thomas Carter and Marty Hogan", the paper stated.

500|$|At {{some point}} in the 1896 season, Hogan {{apparently}} secured his release from the Browns. Once again, however, his physical speed offered no guarantee of consistency on the playing field. [...] On July 21, 1896, the St. Paul (Minneapolis) Globe reported that Hogan had performed poorly in a contest between the Hoosiers and the local ball club. [...] "Marty Hogan...made a bad fumble, and then {{looked up at the sky}} to see if it had moved while he was locating the ball", the paper reported. [...] "It was a good bluff, but the crowd discovered Marty's weakness before the end of the game". [...] In January 1897, the Vindicator reported that the Hoosiers had sold Hogan to a club in Grand Rapids, Michigan. [...] The article called Hogan [...] "one of the fastest outfielders and baserunners in the Western League" [...] and predicted he would [...] "greatly strengthen the Grand Rapids outfield". [...] The following month, however, the paper described the previous report as a [...] "mistake", indicating instead that Hogan had signed a contract with baseball executive John T. Brush to play with the Hoosiers for another year. [...] The paper also reported that the contract granted Hogan [...] "the largest salary he has ever drawn". [...] Despite this lucrative contract, Hogan established and maintained his own advertising distribution agency in Indianapolis. [...] "He goes about the streets dressed much like an English costermonger", Sporting Life reported in January 1897. [...] "Marty can be seen with a little red wagon full of signs and advertising matter chasing up and down streets nailing the signs to buildings and convenient places and distributing advertising literature in the reel-dance portion of Indianapolis". [...] Less than four months later, in May 1897, he was released by the Indianapolis ball club. In June 1897, the Kansas City Journal indicated Hogan had moved on to the Dayton (Ohio) Old Soldiers, a team affiliated with the Class B Interstate League, where he was [...] "playing a sensational center field". In October of the same year, Sporting Life speculated Hogan would remain with Dayton during the upcoming 1898 season. [...] "Marty Hogan's contract with Dayton is such that he cannot be reserved, as are the rest of the players", <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>stated.</b> [...] "Unless Marty has a better offer to play with some other team it is safe to say that he will be with Dayton next year". [...] Further research is required to determine how long Hogan continued to play as an outfielder in the minor leagues. [...] (His obituary indicated that he also worked as a major league trainer.) [...] During his playing career, he apparently received at least one serious injury. [...] In February 1903, Sporting Life reported that the former baseball player's friends were [...] "anxious to get him appointed on the staff of American League umpires". [...] The article added, [...] "Hogan has suffered from operations to remove portions of his breast bone, which was injured in a collision during a baseball game".|$|E
500|$|Hogan's {{obituary}} stated that, at {{some point}} in his playing career, he set a record for baserunning. [...] Several sources trace this record to a field day event held in Indianapolis in 1895, when he reportedly rounded the bases in 13.2 seconds. The World Almanac and Encyclopedia 1906, for instance, reported that Hogan [...] "lowered the base-running record" [...] in 1895, noting that [...] "he distance around the bases is 120 yards". [...] In January 1906, Sporting Life reported that Hogan had [...] "taken steps to have the base running record awarded to him". [...] The report added, [...] "Under proper conditions [...] turned the route in 13 15 seconds at Indianapolis in 1895". [...] Some observers questioned the veracity of the record, however. [...] In 1907, for instance, Washington Post sports columnist J. Ed Grillo conceded that [...] "Hogan was a great sprinter" [...] but described his unofficial record as [...] "out of reason". [...] Grillo, who argued that [...] "the fastest runners in baseball failed to come anywhere near the mark", lent his support to an official record of 14.1 that had been set more recently by Eastern League player Wally Clement. [...] An article published in the Washington Herald days earlier also raised questions about Hogan's baserunning record. [...] In this case, however, the writer claimed that the most [...] "authentic" [...] record had been set by Harry Berthrong in the 1860s. [...] <b>The</b> <b>article</b> <b>stated</b> that, while Hogan was [...] "said to have beaten Berthrong's base-circling record of 13 25 seconds by a fifth of a second", this alleged feat was not [...] "performed under official sanction". [...] One year earlier, in 1906, Berthrong, himself, weighed in on the debate. [...] According to an article that appeared in [...] Sporting Life in March of that year, Berthrong disputed Hogan's claim. [...] "My time...around the bases was made in Washington, D.C., in July 1868, after the old Nationals of Washington, D.C., had played a game with the Pastimes of Baltimore, Md.", Berthrong was quoted as saying in an interview. [...] "Three stop watches were held over me, the slowest giving me 14 1/4". [...] The retired player added: [...] "I am skeptical about this man Hogan doing the bases in 13 1-5: nobody but an Arthur Duffey could possibly do it, and I doubt if he could". [...] For reasons that are unclear, the article indicated that Hogan claimed to round the bases in 1889, six earlier than other reports. (A similar description of Hogan's claim appeared elsewhere in the same edition of Sporting Life; a brief news item suggested he claimed to set the record [...] "in Indianapolis in the 80's".) Baseball historian Jon Daly traced Hogan's contested record to 1898; he speculated that Ben Morgan, an official of the National Association, [...] "disputed that claim when doing a study of field day records". [...] The most widely accepted national baserunning record was set by Evar Swanson, who rounded the bases in 13.4 seconds in 1929. [...] Despite questions surrounding Hogan's baserunning record, he became popularly known as the [...] "Indianapolis Ringer". [...] Newspaper reports suggest he defended his position as baserunning champion of the Western League in various pre-game competitions. [...] On August 2, 1895, the Vindicator noted that the outfielder had [...] "a rival for the base running honors in the western league in George Nichol of the Milwaukees who, it is claimed, can get down to first quicker than Hogan". [...] The article added, [...] "A race between the two is talked of". [...] Then, on August 17, 1895, the Vindicator reported that Hogan had defeated Detroit outfielder Frank Tower in a baserunning contest. [...] "The Hoosiers have in Mart Hogan a pretty good extra card", the article added. [...] "Indianapolis goes around the land, and their sprinting outfielder meets all comers in foot races before the game. [...] He has not yet been defeated". [...] Several days earlier, the same newspaper quoted a journalist from Sporting Life, who reportedly commented: [...] "Mart Hogan, the Indianapolis outfielder, is showing such astonishing speed that he will probably be taken to England next year for the Sheffield Handicap".|$|E
