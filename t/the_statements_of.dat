5|$|In 2005, {{and again}} in 2008, the Mekong River flooded its banks, {{damaging}} hundreds of rural villages. Living River Siam joined with other NGOs to form the Thai People's Network for Mekong, which pointed to dams in China as {{the primary cause of}} the flooding. An intergovernmental working group called the Mekong River Commission opposed these claims, saying China's dams {{had little to do with}} the flood, although they also pressed China for data on the floodwaters.

5|$|Meanwhile, Geetha starts an {{investigation}} when she realises {{that her son}} has gone missing. After a preliminary investigation, Geetha calls Rambabu and his family in for questioning. Rambabu, predicting that this would happen, coaches his family on how to present their alibi. As a result, when questioned individually, their responses are consistent. They also produce the restaurant receipt, the movie tickets and the tickets of the bus journey as proof of their alibi. <b>The</b> <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> the people who own the establishments that the family visited in Vizianagaram further solidify Rambabu's alibi. However, after a thorough investigation, Geetha realises that Rambabu had acquired the tickets and the receipt {{on the day of}} the incident, made an acquaintance with the owners, and had only actually taken the trip a day later with his family.|$|E

5|$|Prosecutor John McGohey did not {{assert that}} the {{defendants}} had a specific plan to violently overthrow the US government, but rather alleged that the CPUSA's philosophy generally advocated the violent overthrow of governments. The prosecution called witnesses who were either undercover informants, such as Angela Calomiris and Herbert Philbrick, or former communists who had become disenchanted with the CPUSA, such as Louis Budenz. The prosecution witnesses testified about the goals and policies of the CPUSA, and they interpreted <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> pamphlets and books (including The Communist Manifesto) and works by such authors as Karl Marx and Joseph Stalin. Belknap (1994), p 209. The prosecution argued that the texts advocated violent revolution, and that by adopting the texts as their political foundation, the defendants were guilty of advocating violent overthrow of the government.|$|E
5|$|Carlo Maggi, a Catholic {{acquaintance}} of Momolo's {{who was also}} a retired judge, sent a report of Lepori's refutation to Scazzocchio, who asked Antonelli to pass it on to the Pope. A cover letter attached to Maggi's statement described it as proof that Morisi's story was false. Scazzocchio also forwarded an affidavit from the Mortara family doctor, Pasquale Saragoni, who acknowledged that Edgardo had fallen sick when he was about a year old, but stated that he had never been in danger of dying, and that in any case Morisi had been herself bedridden at the time she was supposed to have baptised the boy. A further report sent from Bologna in October 1858, comprising <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> eight women and one man, all Catholics, corroborated the doctor's claims about the sicknesses of Edgardo and Morisi respectively, and alleged that the former maid was given to theft and sexual impropriety. Four women, including the servant Anna Facchini and the woman who had employed Morisi after she left the Mortaras, Elena Pignatti, claimed that Morisi had regularly flirted with Austrian officers and invited them into her employers' homes for sex.|$|E
5|$|The {{report found}} that the {{tendency}} of the evidence presented in the programme was to suggest the terrorists had been unlawfully killed, and {{that it did not}} explore alternative explanations in any depth. Nevertheless, Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for one possible explanation, but sought to raise questions rather than reach a conclusion. In analysing the content of the programme, they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts in their own words rather than presenting them as established fact. Thus, they found that the content did not infringe any requirement for neutrality. The report scrutinised in detail <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> the eyewitnesses who spoke on camera, including the parts of the interviews that {{were not included in the}} broadcast version of the programme. It found, with two exceptions, that the witnesses' statements were fairly represented in the programme. The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning, when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members, when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements. Windlesham and Rampton also considered Asquez's statement and the journalists' decision to incorporate it into the programme. The report considered that the journalists acted reasonably in using the statement, despite Asquez's refusal to sign it, on the grounds that Asquez had given two separate, near-identical statements (including one to a lawyer), and that they considered it unlikely that somebody would invent such a dramatic account. Nonetheless, the report criticised the programme for not informing viewers of Asquez's refusal to sign the statement.|$|E

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} explore the process <b>of</b> {{auditing}} <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> cash flows by auditors of Jordanian public listed companies. In doing so, it used a structured questionnaire that surveyed the views of auditors who work for audit firms that audit <b>the</b> financial <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> Jordanian public listed companies. In particular, auditors were asked about <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> cash flows for their audit and their opinion on <b>the</b> financial <b>statements,</b> <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> their auditing of detailed components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> cash flows, and their use of specific financial ratios related to <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> cash flows in predicting the company’s continuance as a going concern.

40|$|The {{topic of}} present thesis {{is focused on}} a processing of a statement of {{balances}} of business corporations according to the valid regulations of the Czech Republic and a statement of balances compiled in a case of a liquidation of business corporations or in case of insolvency proceedings.

The following part of the thesis deals with a financial statement preparing which includes a preparation leading to finding and booking of profit and income tax.
