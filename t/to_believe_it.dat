Between calling Childermass his servant (leading him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is Norrell in disguise) and trivially performing other feats of magic, the unknown man brings Vinculus back to life.|$|E
5|$|We had Belzer in {{the band}} for six months. I want <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> was purely musical, and I {{honestly}} believe that it wasn't working musically. I also believe that we weren't emotionally mature enough to be close friends with a gay person {{at that point in}} our lives... And Bill was and is a very proud and righteous gay person, very open about his homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|After Thelma leaves Tom, {{he begins}} showing Peter more affection, causing Lois <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> to be strange. Peter then {{states that it}} is no {{stranger}} than when Darth Vader from the film franchise Star Wars was a parking attendant. Vader is then shown in the contemporary world as a failure, and making minimum wage. This scene, as with all scenes that contain references to Star Wars or its characters, was sent to Lucasfilm for approval, in order to protect copyright. After Stewie takes over Brian's radio show, the two begin playing random sound clips from various films and television shows, including dialogue from the 1993 drama film Philadelphia, which was acknowledged as a mistake by Stewie.|$|E

5|$|After {{the split}} with the Bahá'ís, some Azalis were {{very active in}} secular reform {{movements}} and the Iranian Constitutional Revolution (19051907), including Shaykh Ahmad Ruhi Kermani and Mirza Abd-al-Hosayn Kermani. However, the community was still suppressed as a heresy and the accusation of being an Azali was often enough for most <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> to be true. Coupled with the Azali practice of taqiyya (dissimulation) determining {{whether or not a}} particular figure in Persian politics was an Azali is difficult.|$|E
5|$|Dying {{stands of}} B. coccinea were {{observed}} in 1989, and the fungus Cryptodiaporthe melanocraspedia isolated as the cause in 1995. The disease, a form of aerial canker, manifested initially as dead dry brown leaves and the tips of new growth. Plants would die from the top downwards, with larger branches affected over time. Under the outer bark, orange and brown patches of necrosis spread out from leaf nodes until they encircle the stem, which then dies. Flower spikes may be affected during flowering season. In humid spells during warm weather, white or pink spore tendrils are produced on dead wood. One affected stand monitored over three years from October 1989 to June 1992 showed a 97% mortality of plants (compared with a baseline 40%). Investigators Bryan Shearer and colleagues isolated another virulent pathogen that they identified as a species of Zythiostroma, however it appeared to invoke an immune response in the plant. This immune response, coupled {{with the fact that}} it had not been observed in the wild, led them <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> was not a major pathogen of the species. This species has since been reclassified and named as Luteocirrhus shearii.|$|E
5|$|The {{action is}} {{compressed}} and truncated, beginning in medias res with Pandarus already working for Troilus and praising his virtues to Cressida over {{those of the}} other knights they see returning from battle, but comically mistaking him for Deiphobus. The Trojan lovers are together only one night before the hostage exchange takes place. They exchange a glove and a sleeve as love tokens, but the next night Ulysses takes Troilus to Calchas' tent, significantly near Menelaus' tent. There they witness Diomedes successfully seducing Cressida after taking Troilus' sleeve from her. The young Trojan struggles with what his eyes and ears tell him, wishing not <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> Having previously considered abandoning the senselessness of war in favour of his role of lover and having then sought to reconcile love and knightly conduct, he is now left with war as his only role.|$|E

5|$|Scully is told by {{the scarred}} man that William is part alien and that she {{is being used to}} raise the child. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and Doggett tell Scully that the man's DNA is a match to Mulder's, but Scully refuses <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> While the three are talking, the scarred man quietly slips into William's room with a syringe. Though William's crying alerts the agents, the scarred man manages to sneak out of the room before they reach William. Reyes and Scully take the baby to the {{hospital}} and Doggett discovers the man's syringe. The doctor reports that William is fine except for an elevated amount of iron in his blood. In interrogation, Scully confronts the scarred man about his motives. It is revealed that he is actually Jeffrey Spender, a former FBI agent supposedly killed by The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) three years earlier. Spender is also Mulder's half-brother. Spender admits his actions were a ruse and that the syringe contained magnetite meant to make William normal. He explains that the aliens need the child in order to successfully invade the world, but now they have lost him. However, he notes that the conspirators will always pursue the child, despite what he has done. Spender says that he acted out of his hatred for his father, since the new conspiracy was created by The Smoking Man after the alien rebels burned the original group.|$|E

25|$|It {{appears that}} there was either a schism of the Daughters or an attempt to revitalize the Mysterious Order Witches of Salem in New England. There exists a {{petition}} from Hejaz Caldron No. 1, of the Original Mysterious Order Witches of Salem, in New Haven, CT. The form is undated, but the addition of “Original” leads one <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> was a resurrection attempt of some sort.|$|E

25|$|Tandem repeats of trinucleotides {{are very}} {{abundant}} in this genome; one {{class of the}} genome is clustered, leading researchers <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> serves as centromeres.

Expansion of trinucleotide repeats also occurs in humans, in general leading to many diseases. Learning how D. discoideum cells endure these amino acid repeats may provide insight to allow humans to tolerate them.|$|E
