25|$|SUNADELE and {{her sister}} vessel SUNAMELIA sailed usually in a {{triangular}} trade in the Atlantic, between Northern Europe, United Kingdom, Caribbean Sea, Central America and Canada/USA. From Europe and from Canada general cargo was carried to the West Indies and to Central America, from Canada to Europe the vessels were mainly carrying paper and aluminium products. From the mines of Mackenzie, on Demerara River in Guyana, the <b>tween</b> <b>deck</b> cargo vessels mainly carried bauxite to the aluminium plant in Port Alfred, Canada. Sometimes also a full cargo of sugar from Cuba or from Guyana was carried up to Northern America. On a normal voyage usually three to five ports were visited, especially in the West Indies, among others, Georgetown, Mackenzie in Guyana, Port of Spain on Trinidad, ports in Venezuela, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, the ports of Cuba and Haiti and Jamaica, Santo Domingo, Domenican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the islands of Barbados, Domenica, Grenada and St. Vincent. However the voyages did change, depending on cargo availability and other operational requirements. In North America, the main ports were Montreal, Port Alfred up the Saguenay River in Quebec, Halifax, Saint John (New Brunswick) and New York. In summer time the ships went to the ports in the St. Lawrence River, but in winter time Sunadele/Sunamelia were diverted to the ice-free ports of Halifax and Saint John. In Europe usually the ships called at Antwerp, Hamburg, Rotterdam, and in the U.K. at Avonmouth, Cardiff, Liverpool, London and Glasgow.|$|E

On 26 August they reached Ice Haven, after rounding the northern extremity of the land. Here their vessel became anchored in ice and they wintered {{in a house}} built out of driftwood and planks from the <b>tween</b> <b>decks</b> and the deck-house of the vessel.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 April Dover Hill was at Misukovo Anchorage {{north of}} Murmansk when two Ju-88 bombers {{attacked}} her. Five 500 kg bombs {{exploded in the}} sea around the ship. A sixth hit her and went through her main and <b>tween</b> <b>decks</b> but failed to explode. The minesweeper [...] anchored astern of Dover Hill, ready to rescue any survivors if the bomb exploded. The bomb buried itself in coal in the ship's bunkers {{and a team of}} 19 volunteers dug out the coal to find it. The Luftwaffe made further air raids, and bombs exploding in the sea around the ship repeatedly caused coal to fall back into the hole that the volunteers were digging. The bomb was 22 ft deep in the coal and it took the volunteers two days and nights to reach it. A Soviet bomb disposal specialist then defused it by unscrewing the primer and detonator and the volunteers disposed of the bomb {{over the side of the}} ship.|$|R

50|$|Horizontal armor {{protection}} against aerial bombs and plunging shellfire {{started with the}} flight deck, which acted as the main strength deck. The armor was generally 20 mm thick except for those areas around the elevator shafts and funnel uptakes where thickness increased to 40 mm {{in order to give}} the elevators necessary structural strength and the critical uptakes greater splinter protection. Beneath the lower hangar was the main armored deck (or <b>tween</b> <b>deck)</b> where armor thickness varied from 60 mm over the magazines to 40 mm over the machinery spaces. Along the peripheries, it formed a 45 degree slope where it joined the lower portion of the waterline belt armor.|$|E

5000|$|Left {{in place}} at extreme low tide level in 1878, {{what is left of}} the wreck of King Philip is usually {{completely}} covered in sand. Sometimes, as the profile of the sand on the beach shifts and changes, the timbers reemerge and are visible during low tides. The wreck was partially visible when the schooner Reporter wrecked on the same site on March 13, 1902. Contemporary accounts noted that Reporter was [...] "fast digging her own grave alongside the bones of the King Philip, whose ribs are still seen..." [...] The wrecks of both ships were buried in 1910 when bulldozing of the sand dunes to build the Great Highway pushed large amounts of sand onto the beach. [...] The first documented more recent appearance was in 1982. The wreck was also visible in March 1983, when National Park Service archaeologist James Delgado documented the site with fellow archaeologist Martin T. Mayer. The wreck was exposed in May 1984 to a hitherto unseen degree, at which time Delgado and a larger team returned to document more of the hull. That project determined the ship was nearly half intact (45%) from the keel to the <b>tween</b> <b>deck</b> level, was still partially sheathed in [...] "yellow" [...] or Muntz metal, and was ballasted with rocks from San Franciscos Telegraph Hill. Tangled wire rope and rigging elements as well as timbers from the schooner Reporter were also found mixed into King Philips hull.|$|E
