5|$|The shares debuted on the NYSE on 10 August 2012, and {{initially}} showed a slight rise to $14.05 per share, but closed the day {{back at the}} offer price of $14 each, valuing the club as a whole at $2.3billion, and {{making it one of}} the most valuable sports teams in the world. One of the biggest investors in the IPO was American billionaire George Soros, whose investment company purchased about 3.1million class A shares (1.9% of the club), valued at $40.7million (£25.8million) at the time. Club records announced in November 2012 revealed that gross debt had fallen to £359.7million after the share sale paid off £62.6million of bonds. The club's debts were further remedied in May 2013, after a new loan deal was agreed <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>save</b> the club £10million a year in interest payments on debts now totalling around £307million.|$|E
5|$|Although Desha and {{his entire}} {{administration}} campaigned {{on behalf of}} New Court candidates during the legislative elections of 1825, Old Court supporters regained the state House and evenly split the Senate between Old and New Court supporters. Desha's message to the newly reconstituted General Assembly remained critical of banks and the judiciary, but urged legislators to seek a compromise to resolve the court question. Stickles records that Desha was sincere in his desire for a compromise, albeit one <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>save</b> face for the New Court Party. He promised that, if the legislature would again authorize appointment of {{a new set of}} judges, he would appoint them equally from both parties. Another plan would have expanded the court to six judges, with three appointed from each party. One legislator proposed that all members of both courts resign, along with Desha, lieutenant governor Robert B. McAfee, and all the legislators in the General Assembly, essentially allowing the state government to reset itself. This bill passed the House but was killed in the Senate. The House passed a measure to restore the Old Court, but the Senate deadlocked on the measure and McAfee, the presiding officer in the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote to defeat it.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to revitalize}} {{downtown}} increased in 2013. CBS television executive and Saginaw native David Strouse announced an investment plan in late 2013 <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>save</b> nearly an entire {{block of buildings}} slated for demolition {{at the intersection of}} Washington and Genesee, the core of downtown Saginaw. The plan calls for the renovation and redevelopment of four buildings, creating market-rate apartments on the upper floors and retail space at ground level. In 2012, a similar deal was made in regards to the Bancroft and Eddy apartments, located at the same intersection. Once section-8 housing, these buildings will also be transformed into market-rate apartments and retail space.|$|E

In Rotterdam and Amsterdam the militias forced the vroedschap {{to vote against}} the capitulation. Nevertheless, on June 26 the States General voted four to three (Holland, and the three already occupied provinces Utrecht, Gelderland and Overijssel, against the rest) to send De Groot with a mandate to sign away the Generality Lands and offer a large war indemnity to Louis. Louis thought the offer insufficient, and sent De Groot back empty-handed. It was the last offer he would get.|$|E
25|$|Gary Hamilton {{went out}} on loan to Glenavon, and back in December 2011 took on the role as manager of the club (after the {{resignation}} of Marty Quinn), after being released of his playing obligations by Glentoran. During Young's first season as manager, Glentoran's financial difficulties escalated, until HMRC issued Glentoran a winding up order, and gave the club {{until the beginning of}} January 2011 to clear all outstanding debts which totalled over £300,000. A fund raising organisation, Spirit of '41(which was named after the year when The Oval was bombed by Germans and the massive effort to rebuild it) was set up, and to this day has raised over £25,000. On 12 January 2011, a special EGM was held which set out the proposals <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>save</b> Glentoran from oblivion and change radically how the club is run. The vote was passed unanimously with the condition that 3 new board members were added, including a new chairman, and the current chairman stepped down to vice chairman.|$|E
500|$|Shepard's next {{assignment}} was to VF-193, a night fighter squadron flying the Banshee, {{that was based}} at Naval Air Station Moffett Field, California. The squadron was part of Commander James D. [...] "Jig Dog" [...] Ramage's Air Group 19. Naval aviators with experience in jet aircraft were still relatively rare, and Ramage specifically requested Shepard's assignment {{on the advice of}} Elder, who commanded VF-193's sister squadron, VF-191. Ramage made Shepard his own wingman, a decision <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>save</b> Ramage's life in 1954, when his oxygen system failed and Shepard talked him through a landing. As squadron operations officer, Shepard's most important task was imparting his knowledge of flying jets to his fellow aviators to keep them alive. He served two tours on the aircraft carrier [...] in the western Pacific. It set out on a combat tour off Korea in 1953, during the Korean War, but the Korean Armistice Agreement ended the fighting in July 1953, and Shepard did not see combat.|$|E

500|$|When the U.S. {{version of}} Millionaire was first {{conceived}} in 1998, Michael Davies {{was a young}} television producer who was serving {{as the head of}} ABC's little-noticed reality programming division (at a time when reality television had not yet become a phenomenon in America). At that time, ABC was lingering in third place in the ratings indexes among U.S. broadcast networks, and {{was on the verge of}} losing its status as one of the [...] "Big Three" [...] networks. Meanwhile, the popularity of game shows was at an all-time nadir, as with the exception of The Price Is Right, the genre was absent from networks' daytime lineups at that point. Having earlier created Debt for Lifetime Television and participated with Al Burton and Donnie Brainard in the creation of Win Ben Stein's Money for Comedy Central, Davies decided to create a primetime game show <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>save</b> the network from collapse and revive interest in game shows.|$|E
500|$|Apocalyptic {{notions that}} {{appeared}} in Shangqing Daoism were first developed fully by the Lingbao School. Lingbao cosmology supposed that time was divided into cosmic cycles, which correlated with the Five Phases. At {{the end of a}} cosmic era, the god of the colour associated with that era would descend onto earth and reveal a teaching <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>save</b> a fixed number of people from death. There were two types of cosmic eras, short ones that were characterized by an excess of yin energy, and long ones that were characterized by an excess of yang energy. At the end of a short cosmic era, the moon was prophesized to produce a flood that would erode the mountains, renew the qi of the universe, and change the rankings {{of the members of the}} celestial bureaucracy. At the end of a long cosmic era, evil creatures were unleashed, heaven and earth were turned upside down, and metals and stones melted together. The people who followed the correct teaching revealed by the god of the colour would be gathered up by the Queen Mother of the West and transported to a [...] "land of bliss" [...] that would not be affected by the apocalypse.|$|E
500|$|Early in the series, Clark {{was still}} {{learning}} how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>save</b> everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run." ...|$|E

However, the U.S. economy continued to decline through 1981, and AMC now held on to only two percent of the domestic market and lost about $300 million during the previous two years. Meyers had acknowledged that AMC had no hope of raising the $6 billion it needed to finance more competitive products, stating [...] "It would take dough that just isn't in the cards for us," [...] so the company staked its future on help from Renault, which included development of the Renault Alliance sub-compact for production in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

2500|$|Arriving in the Underworld, Emma is {{contacted}} by Neal Cassidy, who warns to turn back, advice Emma chooses to ignore. She {{and the others}} later discover that the Underworld is for those with unfinished business, and they decide to help others move on, while they search for Hook. With the help of Hook's ex-girlfriend Milah, Emma manages to retrieve Hook from Hades's captivity. However, she is unable to split her heart, as Hades has decided that she, Regina, and Snow are to remain behind for freeing the souls of Prince Henry, Hercules, and Megara. It is discovered {{that the only way}} they would have a chance to return to the [...] "Overworld" [...] with Hook is by overthrowing Hades. In order to defeat Hades, Emma and Hook receive help from Hook's brother Liam; however, it is soon discovered that Liam betrayed them after being blackmailed by Hades. Fortunately, Henry agrees to help undo Liam's work by using his powers as the Author. Later, when Emma and Hook try to perform the heartsplit, they are informed by Hades that Hook's body has been dead for too long and is decaying, making him unable to come back to life. When Emma and Hook go into the depths of the Underworld to find ambrosia, something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>save</b> Hook, they are faced with a True Love test, which they pass when Emma chooses Hook over her own heart, only to realize that Hades had tricked them and destroyed the ambrosia, and Hook tells Emma to leave him in the Underworld, as time is running out for her to go through the open portal. Emma objects, saying that she came to the Underworld to save Hook, and she wasn't leaving without him. Hook eventually gets her to say her goodbyes and she does, only to find out that Hades had trapped her and her family in the library using magic. Emma and Regina work together to use their own magic to counteract it. They all go through the portal, and while Emma has second thoughts about leaving Hook, she is persuaded to go by her father. When they get back to Storybrooke, Zelena is informed by Regina and Robin that Hades tried to trap them in the Underworld, but she brushes off the information and is upset with her sister. She talks to Hades about having the life she wants, which is just a simple picket fence life. However, Hades wants a whole kingdom. Robin and Regina break into the mayor's house, where Zelena and Hades are, trying to get Robin's daughter back from Zelena. Emma, distraught and unable to grieve Hook's death, tries to break down the protection spell surrounding the house, but Zelena uses her magic to stop her. Hades is about to use the Olympian Crystal to [...] "end" [...] Regina, but Robin steps in front of her, taking the blow, which kills him.
