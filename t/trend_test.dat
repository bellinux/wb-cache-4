40|$|Abstract: Proper {{statistical}} analysis of data from subchronic and chronic stud-ies is a key aspect of their data analysis and interpretation. We discuss the motivation and illustrate the use of <b>trend</b> <b>tests</b> for continuous quantitative data from such studies. Because responses are often more severe (increase or de-crease) with increasing dose, <b>trend</b> <b>tests</b> are the most appropriate statistical procedures to apply. Several parametric and nonparametric <b>trend</b> <b>tests</b> are defined and applied to a small set of male liver weight data from a 14 -day rat study. Shortcomings of more standard statistical procedures applied to data from such studies are discussed as well. We recommend the use of <b>trend</b> <b>tests</b> as the customary method for analyzing data from these studies.

40|$|A {{repairable}} {{system can}} briefly {{be characterized as}} a system which is repaired rather than replaced after a failure. The most commonly used models for the failure process of a repairable system are nonhomogeneous Poisson processes (NHPP), corresponding to minimal repairs, and renewal processes (RP), corresponding to perfect repairs. The paper reviews models for more general repair actions, often called "better-than-minimal repair" models. In particular we study the class of so called trend-renewal processes (TRP), which has both the NHPP and the RP as special cases. Parametric inference in TRP models is considered, including cases with several systems involving unobserved heterogeneity. <b>Trend</b> <b>testing</b> is discussed when the null hypothesis is that the failure process is an RP.

50|$|A {{generalization}} of the Spearman coefficient {{is useful in}} the situation where there are three or more conditions, a number of subjects are all observed in each of them, and it is predicted that the observations will have a particular order. For example, a number of subjects might each be given three trials at the same task, and it is predicted that performance will improve from trial to trial. A test {{of the significance of}} the trend between conditions in this situation was developed by E. B. Page and is usually referred to as Page's <b>trend</b> <b>test</b> for ordered alternatives.|$|E
50|$|In statistics, the Jonckheere <b>trend</b> <b>test</b> (sometimes {{called the}} Jonckheere-Terpstra test) {{is a test}} for an ordered {{alternative}} hypothesis within an independent samples (between-participants) design.

However, with the Kruskal-Wallis test there is no a priori ordering of the populations from which the samples are drawn. When there is an a priori ordering, the Jonckheere test has more statistical power than the Kruskal-Wallis test. The test was developed by A. R.

If we suspect a linear trend in the frequencies, then the weights t = (0,1,2) should be used. These weights are also often used when the frequencies are suspected to change monotonically with B, even if the trend is not necessarily linear.|$|E

50|$|The Cochran-Armitage {{test for}} trend, named for William Cochran and Peter Armitage, {{is used in}} {{categorical}} data analysis when {{the aim is to}} assess for the presence of an association between a variable with two categories and a variable with k categories. It modifies the Pearson chi-squared test to incorporate a suspected ordering in the effects of the k categories of the second variable. For example, doses of a treatment can be ordered as 'low', 'medium', and 'high', and we may suspect that the treatment benefit cannot become smaller as the dose increases.
