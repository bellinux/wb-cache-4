5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>criticism,</b> {{his ideas}} were often oversimplified, misrepresented, distorted or exaggerated for various purposes. This heightened the controversy.

5|$|Culverhouse {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} team owners in the NFL, and was credited with modernizing the league, even while his teams were rarely competitive on the field. He oversaw the league's course of direction through two player strikes, and the modern league's financial stability is in great part due to his leadership. He held influence for over a decade, before stepping back due <b>to</b> <b>criticism</b> of what other owners saw as his overly-secretive ways.|$|E
5|$|Even {{prior to}} the cost {{increases}} which plagued the design and construction of the tram, the project has been subject <b>to</b> <b>criticism</b> from the public. Many residents in the neighborhoods under the tram's route object to the tram's presence. The cost increases themselves, and the perceived machinations of public officials, have been controversial. Some consider the project an unworthy use of public funds at any price, either {{due to a lack}} of benefit for those not associated with OHSU, or due to opposition to such projects in general.|$|E

5|$|Having taken charge Huggins did not {{shy away}} from making {{personnel}} changes. Upon taking over the Yankees, he stressed fundamental baseball, drilling the Yankees {{in the art of}} the bunt. Huggins also made his first player transaction, acquiring Del Pratt and Eddie Plank from the St. Louis Browns trading Nick Cullop, Joe Gedeon, Fritz Maisel, Les Nunamaker, Urban Shocker and $15,000 ($ in current dollar terms), a move that led <b>to</b> <b>criticism</b> in the press.|$|E
5|$|In {{the major}} MRT {{disruption}} of 15 December 2011, one C151 train (trainset 067/068, T139 in the COI) was stalled {{in the tunnel}} and its backup battery failed. The passenger compartments in T139 experienced a blackout and loss of ventilation, leading to one passenger smashing a train door window to avoid suffocation. The battery failure led <b>to</b> <b>criticism</b> by the COI {{on the condition of}} the aging emergency batteries installed on all C151 trains. SMRT has since proposed an upgrading plan to address this issue.|$|E

5|$|Physically, Britten {{was never}} robust. He walked and swam {{regularly}} and kept himself as fit as he could, but Carpenter in his 1992 biography mentions 20 illnesses, {{a few of}} them minor but most fairly serious, suffered over the years by Britten before his final heart complaint developed. Emotionally, according to some commentators, Britten never completely grew up, retaining in his outlook something of a child's view of the world. He was not always confident that he was the genius others declared him to be, and though he was hypercritical of his own works, he was acutely, even aggressively sensitive <b>to</b> <b>criticism</b> from anybody else.|$|E
5|$|Pre-release {{reception}} {{for the game}} was generally positive, with critics comparing the game to Konami's cancelled Silent Hills title and its P.T. demo. Resident Evil 7 received generally favorable reviews, which praised the gameplay, graphics, and design. PlayStation VR was hailed for increasing player involvement. However, it was also subject <b>to</b> <b>criticism,</b> with decreased resolution and physical discomfort cited as its main complaints. Further criticism was directed at the game's boss battles and the final chapter of the game. It had the third-best sales debut in the series and has sold over 4 million copies.|$|E
5|$|Robben's first {{participation}} at {{an international}} tournament came at UEFA Euro 2004 when manager Dick Advocaat called up younger players, such as Wesley Sneijder and John Heitinga. During the group stage of the tournament, Advocaat substituted Robben in the 66th minute to defend a 2–1 lead over the Czech Republic. The Czechs, however, then scored two goals and won 3–2, which led <b>to</b> <b>criticism</b> about Advocaat's decision. In the quarter-finals, Robben scored the deciding kick in the penalty shootout between the Netherlands and Sweden, which ensured that at the fifth attempt, the Dutch finally won a shootout.|$|E
