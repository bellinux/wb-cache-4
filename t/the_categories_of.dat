5|$|Anarchism {{does not}} offer a fixed body of {{doctrine}} from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not {{all of which are}} mutually exclusive. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into <b>the</b> <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.|$|E

40|$|The Ehresmann-Schein-Nambooripad (ESN) Theorem asserts an {{equivalence}} between <b>the</b> <b>category</b> <b>of</b> inverse semigroups and <b>the</b> <b>category</b> <b>of</b> inductive groupoids. In this paper, {{we consider}} <b>the</b> <b>category</b> <b>of</b> inverse <b>categories</b> and functors [...] a natural generalization of inverse semigroups [...] {{and extend the}} ESN theorem to an equivalence between this <b>category</b> and <b>the</b> <b>category</b> <b>of</b> top-heavy locally inductive groupoids and locally inductive functors. From the proof of this extension, we also generalize the ESN Theorem to an equivalence between <b>the</b> <b>category</b> <b>of</b> inverse semicategories and <b>the</b> <b>category</b> <b>of</b> locally inductive groupoids and to an equivalence between <b>the</b> <b>category</b> <b>of</b> inverse <b>categories</b> with oplax functors and <b>the</b> <b>category</b> <b>of</b> top-heavy locally inductive groupoids and ordered functors.

5|$|Chrysippus is {{the first}} Stoic for whom the third of the four Stoic categories, i.e. the {{category}} somehow disposed is attested. In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently makes use of <b>the</b> <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> substance and quality, but makes little use {{of the other two}} Stoic categories (somehow disposed and somehow disposed in relation to something). It is not clear whether the categories had any special significance for Chrysippus, and a clear doctrine of categories may be the work of later Stoics.|$|E
5|$|Internal realism was {{the view}} that, {{although}} {{the world may}} be causally independent of the human mind, {{the structure of the}} world—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not ontologically independent. The general idea is influenced by Kant's idea of the dependence of our knowledge of the world on <b>the</b> <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> thought.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGiven a monad T on Set whose functor factors through <b>the</b> <b>category</b> <b>of</b> ordered sets {{with left}} adjoint maps, <b>the</b> <b>category</b> <b>of</b> Kleisli monoids {{is defined as}} <b>the</b> <b>category</b> <b>of</b> monoids in <b>the</b> hom-sets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kleisli <b>category</b> <b>of</b> T. <b>The</b> Eilenberg–Moore <b>category</b> <b>of</b> T is shown to be {{strictly}} monadic over <b>the</b> <b>category</b> <b>of</b> Kleisli monoids.

5|$|As {{is typical}} of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European {{languages}} though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections. English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing <b>the</b> <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.|$|E
