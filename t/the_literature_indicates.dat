25|$|The {{manufacture}} of silicone breast implants requires the metallic element Platinum (Pt., 78) {{as a catalyst}} to accelerate the transformation of silicone oil into silicone gel for making the elastomer silicone shells, and for making other medical-silicone devices. <b>The</b> <b>literature</b> <b>indicates</b> that trace quantities of platinum leak from such types of silicone breast implant; therefore, platinum {{is present in the}} surrounding pectoral tissue(s). The rare pathogenic consequence is an accumulation of platinum in the bone marrow, from where blood cells might deliver it to nerve endings, thus causing nervous system disorders such as blindness, deafness, and nervous tics (involuntary muscle contractions).|$|E

2500|$|For boreal aspen stands {{less than}} 40 years old, Comeau (2002) found that basal area {{provided}} a useful general predictor of understorey light levels, but, {{on the basis}} of light measurements in one 80-year-old stand, cautioned that relationships between understorey light and basal area may not hold in older stands. <b>The</b> <b>literature</b> <b>indicates</b> that the height growth of understorey spruce should be maximized when light levels exceed 40% or when aspen basal area is [...] < 14 m²/ha. Models developed by Wright et al. (1998) show radial growth of understorey white spruce increasing almost linearly with increasing light and a continuous decline in radial increment with increasing aspen basal area. When applied to Comeau’s (2002) data, the Wright et al. (1998) models suggest that spruce mortality will remain very low until aspen basal area exceeds 20 m²/ha, above which mortality will increase rapidly.|$|E
2500|$|Among adolescents, {{researchers}} have primarily focused on heterosexual Caucasian populations. [...] <b>The</b> <b>literature</b> <b>indicates</b> that rates are similar {{for the number}} of girls and boys in heterosexual relationships who report experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV), or that girls in heterosexual relationships are more likely than their male counterparts to report perpetrating IPV. Ely et al. stated that, unlike domestic violence in general, equal rates of IPV perpetration is a unique characteristic with regard to adolescent dating violence, and that this is [...] "perhaps because the period of adolescence, a special developmental state, is accompanied by sexual characteristics that are distinctly different from the characteristics of adult." [...] Wekerle and Wolfe theorized that [...] "a mutually coercive and violent dynamic may form during adolescence, a time when males and females are more equal on a physical level" [...] and that this [...] "physical equality allows girls to assert more power through physical violence than is possible for an adult female attacked by a fully physically mature man." ...|$|E
