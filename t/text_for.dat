5|$|By the mid-15th century, Magna Carta {{ceased to}} occupy {{a central role in}} English {{political}} life, as monarchs reasserted authority and powers which had been challenged in the 100 years after Edward I's reign. The Great Charter remained a <b>text</b> <b>for</b> lawyers, particularly as a protector of property rights, and became more widely read than ever as printed versions circulated and levels of literacy increased.|$|E
5|$|Several {{manuscripts and}} early printed {{versions}} of De Materia Medica survive, including the illustrated Vienna Dioscurides manuscript {{written in the}} original Greek in sixth-century Constantinople; it was used there by the Byzantines as a hospital <b>text</b> <b>for</b> just over a thousand years. Sir Arthur Hill saw a monk on Mount Athos still using a copy of Dioscorides to identify plants in 1934.|$|E
40|$|Children read <b>texts</b> <b>for</b> various reasons. We {{examined}} how reading <b>texts</b> <b>for</b> different purposes affected amounts of incidental word learning. Grade 6 {{students were asked}} to read <b>texts</b> <b>for</b> fun, to learn about the topic of the <b>text,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>text</b> comprehension. Proportions of words learned incidentally while reading ranged from. 06 for free reading to. 08 when reading <b>for</b> <b>text</b> comprehension to. 10 when reading to learn about the topic. Level of reading ability was a significant factor in all conditions. Low-ability readers hardly learned any words incidentally; high-ability readers defined up to 27 of every 100 unknown words when reading <b>for</b> <b>text</b> comprehension. Implications <b>for</b> future research on incidental word learning and reading instruction are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by veteran composer Koji Kondo, who created new {{interpretations of the}} familiar melodies from earlier games as well as entirely new material. Super Mario 64 {{was one of the}} first games in the series to feature Charles Martinet as the voice of Mario. It also features the voices of Leslie Swan (then Senior Editor of Nintendo Power) as Princess Peach, who also wrote the English <b>text</b> <b>for</b> the game.|$|E
5|$|Bach had {{composed}} his Christmas Oratorio, {{based on}} the gospels of Luke and Matthew, in 1734, a work in six parts to be performed on six occasions during Christmas tide. He had composed an Easter Oratorio already in 1725. The Ascension Oratorio appeared thus in the same liturgical year as the Christmas Oratorio. The <b>text</b> <b>for</b> the Ascension Oratorio, a compilation of several biblical sources, free poetry and chorales, was presumably written by Picander who had written the libretti for the St Matthew Passion and the Christmas Oratorio, among others. It follows {{the story of the}} Ascension as told in Luke, Mark and the Acts of the Apostles.|$|E

5|$|Due to the Famicom's {{restricted}} hardware capabilities, the remake {{is entirely}} two-dimensional. Special compensation {{was made for}} some of the in-battle sprites such as Cloud Strife's, combining two 16x24 pixel sprites side-by-side instead of the usual single sprite to account for weapons such as Cloud's sword or Barret's gun. While most Japanese games use only 8x8-pixel hiragana or katakana fonts, and most Chinese games use 4-color 16x16-pixel tiles stored in dedicated CHR ROM pages, this game uses its own several-hundred 16x16-pixel monochrome font instead. The script itself is strewn in chunks across the code; {{at the beginning of each}} piece of <b>text</b> <b>for</b> dialog boxes is a three digit number preceded by an @-symbol, signifying which character portrait to display.|$|E
5|$|Escher, who {{had been}} very fond of and {{inspired}} by the landscapes in Italy, was decidedly unhappy in Switzerland. In 1937, the family moved again, to Uccle (Ukkel), a suburb of Brussels, Belgium. World War II forced them to move in January 1941, this time to Baarn, Netherlands, where Escher lived until 1970. Most of Escher's best-known works date from this period. The sometimes cloudy, cold and wet weather of the Netherlands allowed him to focus intently on his work. After 1953, Escher lectured widely. A planned series of lectures in North America in 1962 was cancelled after an illness, and he stopped creating artworks for a time, but the illustrations and <b>text</b> <b>for</b> the lectures were later published {{as part of the}} book Escher on Escher. He was awarded the Knighthood of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In Nuskhuri manuscripts, Asomtavruli {{are used}} for titles and {{illuminated}} capitals. The latter were used at the beginnings of paragraphs which started new sections of text. In {{the early stages of}} the development of Nuskhuri texts, Asomtavruli letters were not elaborate and were distinguished principally by size and sometimes by being written in cinnabar ink. Later, from the 10th century, the letters were illuminated. The style of Asomtavruli capitals can be used to identify the era of a <b>text.</b> <b>For</b> example, in the Georgian manuscripts of the Byzantine era, when the styles of the Byzantine Empire influenced Kingdom of Georgia, capitals were illuminated with images of birds and other animals.|$|E

5|$|Initially, experts {{determined}} the manuscript was genuine, as the date Horse picked matched {{the time period}} Horne had been alive and active, and the manuscript's topics matched the poet's interests. Horse had written the manuscript without knowing any of these details. After his hoax was discovered, Horse held onto the <b>text</b> <b>for</b> the next decade, until he played Myst and 7th Guest and decided the point-and-click adventure genre was a good match for his conspiracy theory-inspired ideas. He later {{said that while the}} story of Myst did not interest him, the game's artwork and the sense of immersion inspired him to immediately begin working on Drowned God in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Many reviews {{commented on}} the {{graphics}}, citing there were other games with better graphics at the time. GamePro rated the graphics at 3.5 out of 5. Though the graphics were not well received, the character animations were very well received. The lack of audio dialog, which forced the player to read <b>text</b> <b>for</b> the story mode, was also a negative when many other games on the PS2 {{at the time were}} adding in voice overs. GamePro rated the overall sound a 3 out of 5. Other reviews rated the audio better, particularly the music and sound effects during the fights.|$|E
5|$|Numerous polemicists, such as Irish {{journalist}} Philip Graves in a 1921 {{article in}} The Times, and British academic Norman Cohn in his 1967 book Warrant for Genocide, have proven The Protocols {{to be both}} a hoax and a clear case of plagiarism. There is general agreement that Russian-French writer and political activist Matvei Golovinski fabricated the <b>text</b> <b>for</b> Okhrana, the secret police of the Russian Empire, {{as a work of}} counter-revolutionary propaganda prior to the 1905 Russian Revolution, by plagiarizing, almost word for word in some passages, from The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu, a 19th-century satire against Napoleon III of France written by French political satirist and Legitimist militant Maurice Joly.|$|E

5|$|Schmeisser helped {{organize}} and {{played on the}} Mount Washington Lacrosse Club, a highly successful Baltimore-based amateur team. Since there was no professional league, many former college lacrosse stars played for Mount Washington. The club regularly participated in exhibition games against the top intercollegiate programs and very rarely lost. In 1904, Schmeisser and Abercrombie co-authored Lacrosse: From Candidate to Team, a book which became the sport's standard <b>text</b> <b>for</b> the next fifty years. He also helped promote lacrosse at the University of Maryland and the Naval Academy.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} of his third edition, Erasmus had seen the Complutensian Polyglot, and used its <b>text</b> <b>for</b> improvement of his own text. In the Book of Revelation he altered his fourth edition (1527) in about 90 passages {{on the basis of the}} Complutensian text. Unfortunately Erasmus had forgotten what places of the Apocalypse he translated from Latin and he did not correct all of them. Except in the Revelation, the fourth edition differed only in about 20 places from his third (according to Mill about 10 places). The fourth edition was printed in three parallel columns, they contain the Greek, Erasmus' own Latin version, and the Vulgate.|$|E
5|$|The Corpus Juris Civilis, {{the name}} for the massive body of law promulgated by Emperor Justinian from the 530s CE and onwards, {{consists}} of two historical collections of laws and their interpretation (the Digest, opinions of the pre-eminent lawyers from the past, and the Codex Justinianus, a collection of edicts and rescripts by earlier emperors), along with Jusinian's prefatory introduction <b>text</b> <b>for</b> students of Law, Institutes, plus the Novels, Justinian's own, later edicts. That the earlier collections {{were meant to be}} sources for the actual, current practice of law, rather than just being of historical interest, can be seen, for example, from the inclusion, and modification of Modestinus' famous description of poena cullei (Digest 48.9.9), in Justinian's own law text in Institutes 4.18.6.|$|E

Many translations, often partial (single volumes, or all volumes to a certain date), abridged, reprinted in the same translation by different printers, or with additional <b>text</b> (<b>for</b> example on insects) and new illustrations, were made {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century and the start of the nineteenth century, presenting a complicated publication history.

5|$|The Ormulum {{consists}} of 18,956 lines of metrical verse, explaining Christian teaching {{on each of}} the texts used in the mass throughout the church calendar (Treharne 2000, p.273). As such, it is the first new homily cycle in English since the works of Ælfric of Eynsham (c. 990). The motivation was to provide an accessible English <b>text</b> <b>for</b> the benefit of the less educated, which might include some clergy who found it difficult to understand the Latin of the Vulgate, and the parishioners who in most cases would not understand spoken Latin at all (Treharne 2000, p.273).|$|E
5|$|The symphony had {{established}} itself {{by the end}} of the 18th century as the most prestigious of instrumental genres. While the genre had been developed with considerable intensity throughout that century and appeared in a wide range of occasions, it was generally used as an opening or closing work; in between would be works that included vocal and instrumental soloists. Because of its lack of written <b>text</b> <b>for</b> focus, it was seen as a vehicle for entertainment rather than for social, moral or intellectual ideas. As the symphony grew in size and artistic significance, thanks in part to efforts in the form by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, it also amassed greater prestige. A concurrent change in attitude toward instrumental music in general also took place, and the lack of text, once seen as a handicap, became considered a virtue.|$|E
