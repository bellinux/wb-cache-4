Furthermore, a criterion for Hamiltonizability of the system on the so-called ultimate reduced level is given.

A heated table is required under international carom rules and is an especially important requirement for the games of three-cushion billiards and artistic billiards.|$|R
25|$|Eight {{years would}} pass {{before they would}} first lift the Currie Cup in 1946, when they {{defeated}} the Western Province 11-9 at home at Loftus Versfeld thanks to two dropped goals (one off his left foot) by Springbok flyhalf Hansie Brewis; the score was 8-9 to Province (a drop goal counted 4 points in those days). With time running out Brewis, the first true Northerns legend, received the ball in his own twenty-two. With an enormous kick, {{he tried to get}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>rolling</b> out in the north-eastern corner, but the ball kept rolling and the Western Province full-back, Con de Kock, carelessly waited for it to roll out. When the ball jumped back in field, De Kock noticed Johnny Lourens storming down at full pace and, realising the danger, kicked hastily at the ball but missed it completely. Lourens scooped it up to score the winning try.|$|E
25|$|In {{the top of}} {{the sixth}} inning, the Cubs {{extended}} their lead to 8-4 when Zobrist, now playing left field, walked and Russell doubled – <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>rolling</b> to the left-field wall right past a sliding Jayson Werth, who lost it in the stadium's lights – to drive Zobrist in. In the bottom of the sixth, the Nationals began to battle back. After getting the first two outs, Chicago reliever Pedro Strop walked Jayson Werth. Mike Montgomery relieved Strop and promptly gave up a double to Bryce Harper that advanced Werth to third. Next, he walked Ryan Zimmerman on a wild pitch that allowed Werth to score – cutting Chicago′s lead to 8-5 – and advanced Harper to third. Daniel Murphy followed with a double that scored Harper and advanced Zimmerman to third. After the Cubs intentionally walked third baseman Anthony Rendon, Montgomery finally got Wieters to end the inning by flying out with the Cubs leading 8-6.|$|E
25|$|With Zimbabwe restricting Australia to just 138, by Twenty20 {{standards}} a poor score, Taylor also {{opened their}} innings. While Vusi Sibanda got <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>rolling</b> with several quick boundaries, Taylor {{was the key}} man, and batted out the innings. With both teams reasonably even placed for the first dozen overs, it was when Brad Hodge came on to bowl his gentle offspin in the 15th over that Taylor turned the match in Zimbabwe's favour. 15 was scored from the over, including two massive sixes by Taylor, the longest of which went 77 metres. With 12 runs required from the final over, Taylor played a cheeky sweep which went for 4 from the first ball. Followed by a single, a two and another single, Zimbabwe needed 4 runs from 2 balls with Taylor facing, Chigumbura at the non-strikers end. With a ball to spare, 4 leg-byes were scored, with the ball running down to fine leg. Taylor ended with 60 not out from 45 deliveries. His fine all round performance with the bat and gloves won him {{the man of the}} match award.|$|E

25|$|Format in {{this tournament}} was {{same as the}} first one: four groups of three, then two groups of four in quarter-finals; top two into semi-finals. This {{competition}} was played in London, Lord's and Oval, and Nottingham. Out of the 10 full members, Zimbabwe withdrew its participation. Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland qualified for the tournament. It was full of surprise victories, as favourites fell {{at the hands of}} underdogs. The hosts, England, set <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>rolling</b> in the first match of the tournament as they were embarrassed by Netherlands in a final-ball thriller. Australia were dominated by West Indies, largely thanks to a thunderous innings by Chris Gayle, as he hit 88 off 50 balls, including some of the largest sixes seen in England. Australia were then defeated by Sri Lanka, who bowled tightly and batted with dominance, including quick-fire half centuries from Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara. Ireland beat Bangladesh in the Group stage to qualify for the Super Eight. Previous champions, India, lost all its matches of the Super Eight Stage. South Africa hadn't lost a group stage match going into the semi-finals against Pakistan, but Shahid Afridi produced a match winning performance with both bat and ball. He blasted his way to 51 and bagged two wickets for 16 runs to secure victory. The final at Lord's was a repeat of a group stage match between Sri Lanka and Pakistan; the latter lost the previous encounter. Pakistan managed to remove Dilshan, the Player of the Series for his 317 runs, without scoring, which had a big impact on the Sri Lanka innings. Sangakkara put up a fight scoring an unbeaten 64, but a target of 138 wasn't going to be easy to defend. Afridi proved this to be correct, hitting an unbeaten 54, which helped Pakistan win the trophy with 8 balls to spare.|$|E
500|$|Norman Shrapnel, in his {{obituary}} of Powell, speculates {{whether the}} author ever regretted creating the [...] "maddening, mysterious, apparently indestructible Widmerpool" [...] and, like Ali, expresses disappointment with {{the manner of}} the character's death. Conversely, in a biographical sketch of Powell, Michael Barber believes that Widmerpool's demise accords with a principal theme of the novels, expressed in Casanova's Chinese Restaurant (fifth book in the sequence), that [...] "in the end most things in life—perhaps all things—turn out to be appropriate". Michael Gorra, reviewing Powell's autobiography To Keep <b>the</b> <b>Ball</b> <b>Rolling,</b> presents the view that, while the novels are built around Widmerpool, they are not essentially about him: [...] "He is an organising principle, a means, not an end, and serves primarily to establish a system of judgement." ...|$|E

50|$|Agitated Feed hoppers {{improve on}} the Gravity {{method of feeding}} the marker. Some use simple {{agitation}} levers or paddles inside the hopper to shake up <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> and guide them down the feed neck. Others (sometimes colloquially known as 'revies') use a paddle wheel inside the hopper to force any <b>balls</b> reaching <b>the</b> {{bottom of the hopper}} into the feed neck. Agitated Feeders need gravity to keep <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>rolling</b> toward <b>the</b> bottom of the hopper before they can reach the loading mechanism. The 'Revo' with 'Z-Board' uses an electric motor to spin the paddle wheel at high speed and this method remains one of the fastest loading systems as of March 2013.|$|R

500|$|Hill was {{the victim}} of bad luck during this {{sequence}} of scores between 90 and 99. [...] At Melbourne during the New Years Test he scored 99; the first time a batsman was dismissed one run short of a century in Test cricket. In the first innings in the next Test in Adelaide, having scored 98, Hill was caught by Johnny Tyldesley who was standing on the bicycle track surrounding the oval. [...] Tyldesley attempted to call Hill back but Hill declined, saying the captains had agreed that the fence was the boundary, not the track. [...] Under modern laws, he would have been notout and the shot would count as six runs, allowing him his century. [...] In the second innings, Hill's poor luck continued. He chopped down on a ball when 97 and then, to his horror, saw <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>rolling</b> back towards his stumps. [...] He attempted to hit the ball away from the stumps but accidentally knocked the leg bail and was out, bowled. The English writer, Simon Wilde, has described this sequence as an [...] "unparalleled spell of nonagenarians' neurosis".|$|E

Once we finally got <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>rolling,</b> it was almost time to go. It was natural though.
