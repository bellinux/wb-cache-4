5|$|After Chickamauga, Rosecrans and his Army of the Cumberland {{retreated to}} {{fortified}} Chattanooga. Bragg held an ineffective siege against Chattanooga, but refused <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>any</b> further action as the Union forces there were reinforced by Ulysses S. Grant and reopened a tenuous supply line. Many of Bragg's subordinates, including Buckner, advocated that Bragg be relieved of command. Thomas L. Connelly, {{historian of the}} Army of Tennessee, believes that Buckner {{was the author of}} the anti-Bragg letter sent by the generals to President Jefferson Davis. Bragg retaliated by reducing Buckner to division command and abolishing the Department of East Tennessee.|$|E

Archer returns in a shuttlepod along with T'Pol and a {{security}} crew, led by Lieutenant Reed — all wearing their modern uniforms. Landing {{in the center of}} town, he informs the Sheriff that he is from Earth and will return to help them once their mission is over. Bennings then shoots MacReady, starting a firefight. In the chaos, Archer is also shot by Bennings, but finally overpowers him in a fistfight.

5|$|Fearing {{a popular}} revolt {{following}} the unrest {{created by the}} Great Depression, wealthy Guatemalan landowners lent their support to Jorge Ubico, who won an uncontested election in 1931. Ubico's regime {{became one of the}} most repressive in the region. He abolished debt peonage, replacing it with a vagrancy law which stipulated that all landless men of working age needed to perform a minimum of 100 days of forced labor annually. He authorized landowners <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>any</b> actions they wished against their workers, including executions. Ubico was an admirer of European fascist leaders such as Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, but had to ally with the U.S. for geopolitical reasons, and received substantial support from this country throughout his reign. A staunch anti-communist, Ubico reacted to several peasant rebellions with incarcerations and massacres.|$|E
5|$|He {{has never}} been charged with any crime due to {{apparent}} mental inculpability. One contentious issue of Weston's incarceration is that of forced medication. Weston has thus far refused <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>any</b> medications voluntarily. His lawyers helped enable this, {{in order to protect}} him from the death penalty. In May 2001, a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily. A panel from a federal appeals court ruled in July 2001 that Weston could be forced to take the drugs which he was forced to do for 120 days. He remains in the Butner facility indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, chief agent John Douglas, {{working with}} {{agents in the}} FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit, issued a {{psychological}} profile of the unidentified bomber which described the offender as a man with above-average intelligence with connections to academia. This profile was later refined to characterize the offender as a neo-Luddite holding an academic degree in the hard sciences, but this psychologically based profile was discarded in 1983 {{in favor of an}} alternative theory developed by FBI analysts concentrating on the physical evidence in recovered bomb fragments. In this rival profile, the bomber suspect was characterized as a blue-collar airplane mechanic. A 1-800 hotline was set up by the UNABOM Task Force <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>any</b> calls related to the Unabomber investigation, with a $1million reward for anyone who could provide information leading to the Unabomber's capture.|$|E

5|$|In February 1966, Sukarno {{promoted}} Suharto to lieutenant-general (and to full {{general in}} July 1966). The {{killing of a}} student demonstrator and Sukarno's order for the disbandment of KAMI in February 1966 further galvanised public opinion against the president. On 11 March 1966, the appearance of unidentified troops around Merdeka Palace during a cabinet meeting (which Suharto had not attended) forced Sukarno to flee to Bogor Palace (60km away) by helicopter. Three Suhartoist generals, Major-General Basuki Rahmat, Brigadier-General M Jusuf, and Brigadier-General Amirmachmud went to Bogor to meet Sukarno. There, they Persuaded and secured a presidential decree from Sukarno (see Supersemar) that gave Suharto authority <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>any</b> action necessary to maintain security.|$|E

Stambaugh, who accompanied them, urged the Menominees not <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>any</b> scalps, but Chief Grizzly Bear insisted that such a prohibition could not be enforced. The group tracked down about ten Sauks, only two of whom were warriors. The Menominees killed and scalped the warriors, but spared the women and children.|$|E

5|$|On 16 May, tens of {{thousands}} of university students demanding Suharto’s resignation, occupied the grounds and roof of the parliament building. Upon Suharto's return to Jakarta, he offered to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet. These efforts failed when his political allies deserted him by refusing to join the proposed new cabinet. According to Wiranto, on 18 May, Suharto issued a decree which provided authority to him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>any</b> measures to restore security; however, Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population. On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation, upon which vice-president Habibie assumed the presidency in accordance with the constitution.|$|E
5|$|On 29 March 1944, Duke of York and {{the bulk}} of the Home Fleet left Scapa Flow to provide a support force for Convoy JW 58. The ship {{operated}} in the Arctic and as cover for carriers conducting the Goodwood series of air strikes on Tirpitz in mid to late August. In September, when she was overhauled and partially modernized at Liverpool, radar equipment and additional anti-aircraft guns were added. She was then ordered to join the British Pacific Fleet and sailed in company with her sister-ship Anson on 25 April 1945. A problem with the ship's electrical circuitry delayed her while she was at Malta and, as a result, she did not reach Sydney until 29 July, by which time it too late for her <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>any</b> meaningful part in hostilities against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, Buckner relayed {{orders to}} Pillow from Floyd to release Floyd's and Buckner's troops to operate {{south of the}} river, near Cumberland City, {{where they would be}} able to attack the Union supply lines while keeping a clear path back to Nashville. However, this would leave the Confederate forces at Fort Donelson heavily outnumbered. Pillow left early on the morning of February 12 to argue these orders with General Floyd himself leaving Buckner in charge of the fort. After hearing sounds of {{artillery}} fire, Pillow returned to Fort Donelson to resume command. After the events of the day, Buckner remained at Fort Donelson to command the Confederate right. With the arrival of Grant's army, General Johnston ordered Floyd <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>any</b> troops remaining in Clarksville to aid in the defense of Fort Donelson.|$|E

The other two Arab forces devastated the countryside unopposed, but failed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>any</b> towns or forts. The Arab invasion army also suffered from severe hunger and lack of supplies before returning to Syria, while the 10th-century Arab Christian historian Agapius records that the Byzantines took 20,000 prisoners from the invading forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{delayed release}} of Odin Sphere led to {{issues with the}} company: they needed to start other {{projects}} to keep their company going, leading {{to the development of}} GrimGrimoire. The development of GrimGrimoire drained the company's funds, forcing Kamitani to take out a flexible loan of 20 million yen to keep the company afloat and fund development for their next projects, in addition to finding these projects new publishers as Atlus refused <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>any</b> more of Vanillaware's products until they had seen how Odin Sphere performed commercially. Nippon Ichi Software would handle GrimGrimoire, while Marvelous Entertainment accepted their next project, Muramasa: The Demon Blade for the Wii. The commercial success of Odin Sphere both enabled the development of Muramasa: The Demon Blade and cleared Kamitani's debt. In tandem with their other titles, Odin Sphere helped establish Vanillaware as a respected developer.|$|E
