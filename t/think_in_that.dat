25|$|In 1953, Eric Lenneberg criticised Whorf's {{examples}} from an objectivist view of language holding that languages are principally meant to represent {{events in the}} real world and that even though languages express these ideas in various ways, the meanings of such expressions and therefore the thoughts of the speaker are equivalent. He argued that Whorf's English descriptions of a Hopi speaker's view of time were in fact translations of the Hopi concept into English, therefore disproving linguistic relativity. However Whorf was concerned with how the habitual use of language influences habitual behavior, rather than translatability. Whorf's point was that while English speakers may be able to understand how a Hopi speaker thinks, they do not <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> way.|$|E

Kartheiser described Pete as doing [...] "what he thinks he needs to do to get the account. I don't know if that's always such a good thing, but it's common in business. And I <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> situation, Pete represents that type of businessman." [...] Matthew Weiner and Jared Harris both characterized Lane's decision as two-fold—he gave Joan the best advice for her and for himself.|$|E

She took a hiatus from music, however, after the death of her husband, Scottish saxophonist Jason Rae, in March 2008 to an accidental overdose of methadone and alcohol. For a long period of time, Rae said, [...] "I didn't really hear any songs. Normally in my everyday life, I'd be in the car {{and come up with a}} little line, or I'd look at something and try to describe it ... I didn't really <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> way anymore. Nothing was coming in." [...] After months of grief and isolation, Rae revisited her work the following year and composed additional material for The Sea.|$|E

500|$|Pedro II {{showed no}} {{interest}} in the republican manifesto of 1870. The Marquis of São Vicente, then President of the Council of Ministers, suggested to the Emperor that republicans be forbidden to enter into public service, a practice then common in monarchies. Pedro II answered, [...] "Mr. São Vicente, allow the nation to govern itself and decide whatever [...] they want." [...] The President reprimanded the monarch, [...] "Your Majesty does not have a right to <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> way. The Monarchy is a constitutional doctrine which Your Majesty swore to maintain; it is not incarnate in the person of Your Majesty." [...] But the Emperor did not care and simply answered: [...] "Well, if the Brazilians do not want me as their Emperor, I shall become a teacher instead!" ...|$|E

[...] Nitin replies. [...] "I've got kids myself, and I know I'd react {{the same way}} if I found out that some other guy had taken my child to somebody's house who the child doesn't even know. Masood is still {{the only person who}} can see Yusef for what he really is, so he goes into a blind panic over the situation. Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. The police say that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. I thought that was a great line and really interesting - I <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> moment, Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 16, 1999, tragedy {{struck the}} Kennedy family again when [...] John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s [...] Piper Saratoga light {{aircraft}} {{crashed into the}} Atlantic Ocean {{off the coast of}} Martha's Vineyard. The accident killed Kennedy, his wife, and sister-in-law. As patriarch, Ted consoled his extended family along with President Clinton at the public memorial service. He paraphrased William Butler Yeats by saying of his nephew: [...] "We dared to <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side. But like his father, he had every gift but length of years." [...] Ted now served as a role model for Maria Shriver, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Joseph Patrick Kennedy II, and other family members. The Boston Globe wrote of the changed role: [...] "It underscored the evolution that surprised so many people who knew the Kennedys: Teddy, the baby of the family, who had grown into a man who could sometimes be dissolute and reckless, had become the steady, indispensable patriarch, the one the family turned to in good times and bad." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by March 10, 2008 and was done {{alongside}} [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] and [...] "Cabin Fever". [...] Shooting began by March 24, alongside filming of the previous episode and continued through April 4. [...] The flashforwards were written partially to explain what led Jack to become the drug addict {{that he is in}} third-season finale's flashforwards, who believes that his father is alive. [...] Matthew Fox stated that the fourth season is [...] "starting to close the loop on the end of [...] season. [...] Jack in the future is a man marked by weakness, but the Jack [...] is strong. [...] how he made that transition." [...] When asked why Hurley does not take drugs to see Charlie, but Jack starts his drug addiction to try not to see Christian, Edward Kitsis said that [...] "Jack has … always been a man of science, and there has to be something logical. [...] The scene where Jack is staring at the bench where Hurley sits when Charlie visits him, I <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> moment he's thinking, my life right now is pretty good, I don't want to end up here." [...] In regard to the contrast in Kate's character on the island and after the island, Kitsis said that [...] "you could say [...] motherhood suits her. [...] In the flashforwards … there's a sense of purpose to her, there's some clarity to her. [...] There's so much devotion to that child, and she appears to be such a great mother … taking care of Aaron may have helped her put away some other issues." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even as McCarthy styled {{himself the}} clean politician, however, he dished it out, too. [...] Known for his wit, {{when asked if}} Michigan {{governor}} George Romney's comment {{that he had been}} [...] "brainwashed" [...] about the Vietnam War had ended his presidential hopes, McCarthy remarked, [...] "Well [...] [...] [...] er no, not really. Anyway, I <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> case a light rinse would have been sufficient." [...] as cited in: [...] He mocked Robert Kennedy and his supporters. A major gaffe occurred in Oregon, when McCarthy sniffed that Kennedy supporters were [...] "less intelligent" [...] than his own and belittled Indiana (which had by then gone for Kennedy) for lacking a poet of the stature of Robert Lowell—a friend of McCarthy's who often traveled with him.|$|E

[...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted self-mockery towards [...] "her own idyllic disposition" [...] in the lyrics [...] "I thought I could {{organize}} freedom/How Scandinavian of me!" [...] That line {{was covered in}} various reviews; it {{has been described as}} [...] "hilarious" [...] and [...] "derisively" [...] delivered. When asked about the meaning of those lines, Björk replied: [...] "in Iceland, the people from Sweden, we think they're really not cool at all and they just have got no sense of humour, are really organized. And you can't organize everything. So I <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> song, I was sort of... thinking that I could even organize freedom, just like very stupid. Quite Swedish, you know." [...] Some critics have also identified the lyrics as a hint to a failed relationship.|$|E
