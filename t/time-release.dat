5|$|After {{witnessing}} California-based gang boss Eddie Kim brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes {{to death}} in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747-400 to testify in a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a <b>time-release</b> crate full of venomous snakes {{to be placed in}} the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without the need for provocation, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in a bathroom, and a man using another bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX.|$|E

25|$|In 1975, {{pemoline}} (Cylert) {{was approved}} by the U.S. FDA for use in the treatment of ADHD. While an effective agent for managing the symptoms, the development of liver failure in 14 cases over the next 27 years would result in the manufacturer withdrawing this medication from the market. New delivery systems for medications were invented in 1999 that eliminated the need for multiple doses across the day or taking medication at school. These new systems include pellets of medication coated with various <b>time-release</b> substances to permit medications to dissolve hourly across an 8–12 hour period (Metadate CD, Adderall XR, Focalin XR) and an osmotic pump that extrudes a liquid methylphenidate sludge across an 8–12 hour period after ingestion (Concerta).|$|E

2500|$|The {{addition}} of cultured yeast normally occurs with the yeast {{first in a}} dried or [...] "inactive" [...] state and is [...] reactivated in warm water or diluted grape juice prior to being added to the must. To thrive and be active in fermentation, the yeast needs access to a continuous supply of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus as well as access to various vitamins and minerals. These components are naturally present in the grape must but their amount may be corrected by adding nutrients to the wine, in order to foster a more encouraging environment for the yeast. Newly formulated <b>time-release</b> nutrients, specifically manufactured for wine fermentations, offer the most advantageous conditions for yeast. Oxygen is needed as well, but in wine making, the risk of oxidation {{and the lack of}} alcohol production from oxygenated yeast requires the exposure of oxygen to be kept at a minimum.|$|E

50|$|While {{variation}} {{may occur}} between brands, {{a general rule}} is to mix 1 tablespoon to every four liters (one imperial gallon) of water. In all cases, {{it is better to}} under-fertilize than over-fertilize. The diluted mixture is then used to water the plants. The growth of the plants should be monitored to determine if the fertilizer is helping or harming, and how often (if at all) it should be used. Schedules can range from every other week to every three months. For convenience, granular, <b>time-released</b> fertilizers are also available.|$|R
50|$|Paralysis attacks can {{be managed}} by {{drinking}} one of various potassium salts dissolved in water (debate exists over which, if any one in particular, is best used, but potassium chloride and bicarbonate are common). Rapidly absorbed boluses of liquid potassium are generally needed to abort an attack, but some patients also find positive maintenance results with <b>time-released</b> potassium tablets. IV potassium is seldom justified unless the patient is unable to swallow. Daily potassium dosage {{may need to be}} much higher than for potassium replacement from simple hypokalemia: 100-150 mEqs of potassium is often needed to manage daily fluctuations in muscle strength and function.|$|R

40|$|The double-blinded {{placebo-controlled}} randomized {{crossover study}} {{was performed in}} 29 atherosclerotic men (35 to 70 years old) suffering from cerebral atherosclerosis and chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency to elucidate the effect of <b>time-released</b> garlic powder tablets Allicor on platelet aggregation and serum fibrinolytic activity. It has been demonstrated that Allicor 14 -days treatment significantly inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation by 25. 4 % (p< 0. 05) and increased plasma fibrinolytic activity by 22. 4 % (p< 0. 05). Additionally, the trend to the decrease in plasma fibrinogen level was observed. Evidence obtained from this study indicates that garlic has potential in the prevention and control of cardiovascular disorders and is beneficial when taken as a dietary supplement. We conclude that Allicor may be beneficial in protecting against cardiovascular disease {{as a result of}} inhibiting platelet aggregation and normalizing plasma fibrinolytic activity...|$|R

Fractures were examined radiographically for amount of hard callus; mechanically for torque and stiffness (also expressed {{as a percentage of}} the contralateral intact femur); and histomorphometrically for amount of cartilaginous and noncartilaginous soft callus, hard callus, and total callus. Glucocorticoid administration inhibited fracture healing. The application of a devitalized Type I collagen matrix mitigated the inhibitory effects of prednisolone on fracture healing However, further increases in indices of fracture healing were observed when OP- 1 was added to the collagen matrix compared with collagen alone.

40|$|Abstract The double-blinded {{placebo-controlled}} randomized {{study has}} been performed in 51 coronary heart disease (CHD) patients to estimate the effects of <b>time-released</b> garlic powder tablets Allicor on the values of 10 -year prognostic risk of acute myocardial infarction (fatal and non-fatal) and sudden death, with the respect of secondary CHD prevention. It has been demonstrated that 12 -month treatment with Allicor results in the significant decrease of cardiovascular risk by 1. 5 -fold in men (p < 0. 05), and by 1. 3 -fold in women. The above results were equitable {{also in terms of}} relative risks. The main effect that played a role in cardiovascular risk reduction was the decrease in LDL cholesterol by 32. 9 mg/dl in men (p < 0. 05), and by 27. 3 mg/dl in women. Thus, the most significant effects were observed in men, while in women the decrease of cardiovascular risk appeared as a trend that might be due presumably to the insufficient sample size. Since Allicor is the remedy of natural origin, it is safe with the respect to adverse effects and allows even perpetual administration that may be crucial for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic diseases in CHD patients. </p...|$|R
40|$|Atherosclerosis is {{the cause}} of more than 50 % {{mortality}} in industrial countries. Atherosclerosis develops over many years, so the anti-atherosclerotic therapy should be long-term or even lifelong. Tachyphylaxis, long-term toxicity and cost amongst other issues may present problems for the use of conventional medications in the long-term. Drugs based on natural products can be a good alternative. We have developed a series of natural compounds that are specifically designed to act at the vessel wall and modulate the atherosclerotic lesion. Clinical efficacy was determined in atherosclerosis regression studies with ultrasound examination of carotid arteries. The AMAR study (Atherosclerosis Monitoring and Atherogenicity Reduction) was designed to estimate the effect of two-year treatment with <b>time-released</b> garlic-based drug Allicor on the progression of carotid atherosclerosis in asymptomatic men in double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial. The primary outcome was the rate of atherosclerosis progression, measured by high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography as the increase in carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) of the far wall of common carotid arteries. The mean rate of IMT changes in Allicor-treated group was significantly different from the placebo group in which there was moderate progression. The results of AMAR study demonstrate that long-term treatment with Allicor has a direct anti-atherosclerotic effect on carotid atherosclerosis. These results encouraged clinical trials of two other drug...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this investigation, <b>time-released</b> {{monolithic}} osmotic pump (TMOP) tablets containing diltiazem hydrochloride (DIL) {{were prepared}} {{on the basis}} of osmotic pumping mechanism. The developed dosage forms were coated by Kollidon®SR-Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) mixtures via compression-coated technology instead of spray-coating method to form the outer membrane. For more efficient formulation screening, a three-factor five-level central composite design (CCD) was introduced to explore the optimal TMOP formulation during the experiments. The in vitro tests showed that the optimized formulation of DIL-loaded TMOP had a lag time of 4  h and a following 20 -h drug release at an approximate zero-order rate. Moreover, the release mechanism was proven based on osmotic pressure and its profile could be well simulated by a dynamic equation. After oral administration by beagle dogs, the comparison of parameters with the TMOP tablets and reference preparations show no significant differences for Cmax (111. 56  ±  20. 42, 128. 38  ±  29. 46  ng/ml) and AUC 0 - 48  h (1654. 97  ±  283. 77, 1625. 10  ±  313. 58  ng h/ml) but show significant differences for Tmax (13. 00  ±  1. 16, 4. 00  ±  0. 82  h). These pharmacokinetic parameters were consistent with the dissolution tests that the TMOP tablets had turned out to prolong the lag time of DIL release...|$|R
