5|$|The term {{limbic system}} was {{introduced}} in 1952 by Paul MacLean to describe the set of structures <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>the</b> edge of the cortex (Latin limbus meaning border): These include the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, olfactory cortex, and amygdala. Paul MacLean later suggested that the limbic structures comprise the neural basis of emotion. The hippocampus is anatomically connected to {{parts of the brain}} that are involved with emotional behaviorâ€”the septum, the hypothalamic mammillary body, and the anterior nuclear complex in the thalamus, and is generally accepted {{to be part of the}} limbic system.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of endometrial cancers are carcinomas (usually adenocarcinomas), meaning that they originate from the single layer of epithelial cells <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>the</b> endometrium and form the endometrial glands. There are many microscopic subtypes of endometrial carcinoma, but they are broadly organized into two categories, Type I and Type II, based on clinical features and pathogenesis. The two subtypes are genetically distinct.|$|E

5|$|Upminster Bridge is a London Underground {{station on}} Upminster Road in the Upminster Bridge {{neighbourhood}} of the London Borough of Havering in northeast London, England. The station {{is on the}} District line and is the penultimate station on the eastern extremity of <b>that</b> <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> station was opened on 17 December 1934 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway on the local electrified tracks between Upminster and Barking that were constructed in 1932. The main station building is of a distinctive polygonal design. It has relatively low usage for a suburban station with approximately 1 million entries and exits during 2011.|$|E
5|$|Weston Park is {{situated}} on a peninsula near {{the western end}} of Lake Burley Griffin. The park includes swimming areas, children's play equipment and wading pools, and a miniature railway, and is a popular barbecue spot on weekends. Weston Park forms part of a string of parks <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>the</b> southern shore of Lake Burley Griffin; other parks include Yarralumla Bay, Lennox Gardens (incorporating a Japanese garden named Canberra Nara Park) and Stirling Park.|$|E
5|$|Whack Ball is {{comparable}} to Breakout: the player controls a large ball with the Menacer to push a smaller on-screen ball into color-changing bricks <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>the</b> wall. One all of the bricks change color, the player moves to the next level. Some bricks are power-ups that change the larger ball's size or add extra small balls into play. Players who hit flashing bricks are punished. Inadvertently guiding the ball {{through a hole in}} the wall ends the game.|$|E

5|$|Within the {{memorial}} the architects added an inner shrine, or Record Room, in {{which could be}} recorded {{the names of the}} South Australians who fell during the war. While the design did not specify the exact form that this would take, in the completed memorial these names are inscribed in the bronzes <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>the</b> walls. The design also allowed for a cenotaph within the inner shrine, which the designers suggested could either be used as a symbolic representation of the unknown soldier or as the marker to an actual grave, although this aspect was never realised.|$|E
5|$|Although {{freshwater}} invertebrates inhabiting and comprising {{algae and}} periphyton make {{the foundation of}} food webs {{in the middle and}} lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding {{on the bottom of the}} river and ocean floors. The abundance and importance of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) is apparent in the many middens left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high. Oysters and other mollusks serve as the primary food source of shorebirds. The large trees <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>the</b> river from its source to south of Jacksonville begin to transition into salt marshes east of the city. Mayport is home to approximately 20 shrimping vessels that use the mouth of the St. Johns to access the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|For vertebrates, {{the early}} stages of neural {{development}} are similar across all species. As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate, the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>the</b> groove merge to enclose the neural tube, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.|$|E

5|$|In the {{majority}} of species of caecilians, the young are produced by vivipary. Typhlonectes compressicauda, a species from South America, is typical of these. Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time. They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs, but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>the</b> oviduct. This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths {{as long as their}} mother before being born. By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth. A permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth.|$|E
5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are opportunistic predators, catching prey which drifts {{within reach}} of their tentacles. The prey is secured {{with the help of}} sticky mucus, spirocysts (non-venomous harpoon cells) and nematocysts (venomous harpoon cells). The tentacles then bend to push larger prey into the mouth, while smaller, plankton-size prey, is moved by cilia to the tip of the tentacles which are then inserted into the mouth. The mouth can stretch to accommodate large items, and in some species, the lips may extend to help receive the prey. The pharynx then grasps the prey, which is mixed with mucus and slowly swallowed by peristalsis and ciliary action. When the food reaches the coelenteron, extracellular digestion is initiated by the discharge of the septa-based nematocysts and the release of enzymes. The partially digested food fragments are circulated in the coelenteron by cilia, and from here they are taken up by phagocytosis by the gastrodermal cells <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>the</b> cavity.|$|E
5|$|Several old bronze statues <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>the</b> {{courtyard}} of the temple {{have a long history}} as war loot. They were originally Khmer statues, found at Angkor Wat in Cambodia, and were taken to Ayutthaya in 1431 by the Siamese. In 1564, the Burmese king Bayinnaung conquered Ayutthaya and took thirty such statues to Bago (Pegu). In 1599, King Razagri of Mrauk U invaded Bago and brought the statues to Mrauk U. Finally, Thado Minsaw took them to Amarapura in 1785. According to local belief, many more of these statues were brought from Arakan. However, King Thibaw melted many of them to cast cannons for fortification of his palace. Of the thirty statues Bayinnaung brought from Siam, only six remain today, and are displayed in the temple complex. They are a major attraction because of their purported healing qualities.|$|E

5|$|The Dyre Avenue Branch, meanwhile, would {{continue}} {{north along the}} former New York, Westchester and Boston Railway (NYW)'s right-of-way to Dyre Avenue. The stations along the IRT Dyre Avenue Line, the only portion of the NYW to be reactivated for subway service, would also be shaved back, as the platforms had been widened to accommodate the narrower A Division trains on <b>that</b> <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> platforms on the Dyre Avenue Line would be extended to at least 600 feet to accommodate 10-car B Division trains. The junction north of East 180th Street between the Dyre and White Plains Road Lines, including the latter's approach to the station, would be rebuilt to eliminate the sharp curves at the station approach; the station itself would be reconfigured to allow cross-platform interchanges. Related to the Second Avenue Line, the sharp curves connecting the Lexington Avenue and White Plains Road Lines at 149th Streetâ€“Grand Concourse would also be removed.|$|E
5|$|The western {{terminus}} of M-104 is at US31 in Ferrysburg at {{the north}} end of the drawbridge spanning the Grand River north of Grand Haven. The highway runs along Savidge Street and crosses a bridge over the channel that connect the river with Spring Lake. On the opposite shore, the trunkline continues along Savidge Street, running between the river to its south and the lake to its north. M-104 crosses the central business area of the village of Spring Lake. East of downtown, the highway transitions to follow Cleveland Street which continues due east to Nunica. The landscape becomes more rural east of Spring Lake where the highway crosses terrain with a mix of open fields and woods. There are various businesses and homes <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>the</b> roadway. The eastern terminus of M-104 is located at the exit9 interchange along I-96 just west of Nunica.|$|E
5|$|Tunbridge Wells West {{station was}} opened by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1866 as the {{terminus}} of its competing line to Tunbridge Wells, but closed in 1985 along with <b>that</b> <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> station buildingâ€”a Grade II listed buildingâ€”is now a restaurant, and a Sainsbury's supermarket occupies the former goods yard. In 1996, however, {{part of the}} line was reopened by the Tunbridge Wells and Eridge Railway Preservation Society, which nowâ€”as the Spa Valley Railwayâ€”operates a steam heritage railway that runs from Tunbridge Wells West to Eridge via High Rocks and Groombridge. The western end of the service was extended from Groombridge to Eridge, on the London-Uckfield line of Southern Railway, on 25 March 2011, serving a platform at Eridge which had been disused for many years. The tunnelled link line between the West and erstwhile Central stations, opened in 1876, remains closed.|$|E

5|$|Lewis died in 1893, and in {{the next}} decade the DL built no new lines. However, a group of investors bought the company, {{including}} the Dayton terminal property, in 1901 for $250,000 from Lewis's heirs. The first segment of the line into downtown Dayton was completed in late 1902, branching off the main line at Hempstead and ending at Lambeth, site of the Dayton State Hospital. Unable to obtain a franchise from Dayton, and still unprofitable, the DL entered receivership in January 1905, and was sold at foreclosure in April 1907 and reorganized in May as the Dayton, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad and Terminal Company. The bondholders who had organized the new company succeeded in obtaining the franchise, and sold the stock to a new group of investors in January 1909. Construction was restarted in April, and in November the branch reached the intersection of Brown and Caldwell Streets and the National Cash Register plant. Finally, after completing the cuts and fills required along the east bank of the Great Miami River, the DL opened its new main line in 1912, to a passenger depot {{on the north side of}} Washington Street, several blocks south and west of the city's main Union Station. A freight depot was located just to the north, at Eaker Street, and just beyond was an interchange track (not part of the original line) connecting to the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (B system) and, via <b>that</b> <b>line,</b> <b>the</b> Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Panhandle Route, part of the Pennsylvania system).|$|E
5|$|On July 17, 1962, the NYCTA {{announced}} that it had asked the city for money to build a $190,000,000 high-speed, non-stop subway line from Midtown to the Bronx. The line would have only operated during rush hours. It was estimated that if the funds {{were given to the}} project, it would be completed in 1970. The line would be a two-track line running from 59th Street between Fifth and Seventh Avenues to the Bronx, running under Central Park. Running non-stop for 6.5 miles, {{it would have been the}} longest continuous run in the subway system. The line, on its southern end, would connect to the BMT Broadway Line at Seventh Avenue near 59th Street and to the IND Sixth Avenue Line near 58th Street and Sixth Avenue. The line would then run through a deep tunnel under Central Park until 110th Street. There would be provisions for a future crosstown line under 76th Street to Queens. The line would then turn east and run along Madison Avenue to 138th Street. One branch would connect to the express track of the IRT Pelham Line, which would be converted to accommodate larger B Division trains. In the morning rush hour, trains from Pelham Park would only make express stops. A new stop would be built at 138th Street and Grand Concourse where transfers would have been available to the IRT White Plains Road and IRT Jerome Avenue Line trains. The second branch would continue under the Grand Concourse until 161st Street where it would connect to the IND Concourse Line at 161st Street. This connection would allow for the diversion of Concourse Line express trains onto the new line, allowing for the addition of an equal number of trains to the Washington Heights express service and provide relief to <b>that</b> <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> construction of this line was viewed as necessary to relieve the IRT Lexington Avenue Line.|$|E
