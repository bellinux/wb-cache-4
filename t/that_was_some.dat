Experiments involving noxious stimuli and recordings from the dorsal horn of animals revealed that {{referred pain}} sensations began minutes after muscle stimulation. Pain was felt in a receptive field <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> distance away from the original receptive field. According to hyperexcitability, new receptive fields are created {{as a result of the}} opening of latent convergent afferent fibers in the dorsal horn. This signal could then be perceived as referred pain.|$|E

If a pauper owes me a dollar and I catch him unprotected and make him pay me fourteen dollars thirteen of it is “theft and extortion.” If I make him pay only one dollar thirty-three and a third cents the thirty-three and a third cents are “theft and extortion,” just the same.|$|E

Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, said of Yang's actions after Owen's affair: [...] "It alternately seems silly and not silly, when you really think about it." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today praised Yang's storylines in the eighth season, saying: [...] "Their stories are effectively tied into that of a patient whose ability to move forward is complicated by a complex response to a hideous past." [...] HitFix writer Liane Bonin Starr applauded Yang's brief departure from Seattle Grace to Mayo Clinic in the ninth season, which was [...] "interesting" [...] as [...] "it showed us a new side of her—and after so many seasons, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> welcome insight." ...|$|E

500|$|Prior to recording, DJ Premier {{had listened}} to Nas's debut single, later stating [...] "When I heard 'Halftime', <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> next shit to me. That's just as classic to me as 'Eric B For President' and 'The Bridge'. It just had that type of effect. As simple as it is, all of the {{elements}} are there. So from that point, after Serch approached me about doing some cuts, it was automatic. You'd be stupid to pass that up even if it wasn't payin' no money." [...] Serch later noted the chemistry between Nas and DJ Premier, recounting that [...] "Primo and Nas, {{they could have been}} separated at birth. It wasn't a situation where his beats fit their rhymes, they fit each other." [...] While Serch reached out to DJ Premier, Large Professor contacted Pete Rock to collaborate with Nas on what became [...] "The World Is Yours". Shortly afterwards, producers Q-Tip and L.E.S. chose to work on the album. Nas's father, Olu Dara, also contributed with a cornet solo on [...] "Life's a Bitch", which features rapper AZ.|$|E
500|$|According to Mark Savage from BBC Music, [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] is a disco-rock song, {{which is}} {{composed}} around a building chord sequence {{that he felt}} leads to a [...] "compelling sense of urgency". The singer's vocals are kept raw and untreated on the song, eschewing Auto-Tune. The composition consists of [...] "pulsing verses" [...] and a guitar-and-vocal breakdown before the final chorus, with Gaga singing the main title multiple times. Around the two minute mark, there is a key change before the final chorus. Lewis Corner from Digital Spy felt that the track alluded to Gaga's previous album eras. He called its core a [...] "simple pop song" [...] which harked back to the singer's initial releases like [...] "Just Dance" [...] and [...] "Poker Face" [...] (both 2008). The mixture of guitar and the [...] "grumbling" [...] synths reminded Corner of Gaga's single [...] "Marry the Night" [...] from her second studio album, Born This Way (2011), along with the [...] "thumping" [...] beat. There were also allusions to the Artpop era due to the verse and the refrain being connected in an unconventional manner. Glamour and Rolling Stone reported that some listeners found similarities between the song and Madonna's [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] (1986); {{in response to the}} comparisons, Ronson told the latter magazine, [...] "Obviously, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> kind of accident".|$|E
500|$|Reynolds' {{appearance}} was critically acclaimed. VanDerWerff professed {{that he was}} surprised that it was executed well, as he avouched that shows featuring guest appearances ruin the chemistry of the main cast. [...] "Episodes with big special guest stars can often ruin {{the rhythm of the}} main gang, but I was surprised at how readily the show incorporated Reynolds into the storyline, {{to the point where he}} almost felt like an organic part of the ensemble," [...] avouched VanDerWerff. [...] "The fact that he's still dating Malory at the end of the episode implies that he might pop back in as the season proceeds, and I wouldn't be adverse to that happening, where many special guest stars might make me roll my eyes in irritation." [...] He praised the chemistry between Reynolds and Benjamin, and commended Reynolds for having the will power to poke fun at himself. Carp echoed similar sentiments; [...] "H. Jon Benjamin alone is a voice-over superstar [...] but combined with Reynolds and the rest of the cast, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> animated magic and a fantastic way to kick off the third season." [...] Bonaime thought that Reynolds was [...] "fine with being self-deprecating, and he gives some fantastic moments with Archer." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall enjoyed how Reynolds was utilized in [...] "The Man from Jupiter". [...] "There are times when it can feel awkward when a show spends an episode sucking up to a very special guest star, but it worked here because so much of Archer's personality—and so much of the show's approach to action—feels inspired by all those movies Reynolds did in the '70s and early '80s when he was the biggest movie star in the world.|$|E

2500|$|As of 2005, 68% of American flex-fuel car {{owners were}} not aware they owned an E85 flex. Flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} looked the same. There was no price difference.

Nevertheless, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimated that in 2009 only 504,297 flex-fuel vehicles were regularly fueled with E85, and these were primarily fleet-operated vehicles. As a result, only 712 million gallons were used for E85, representing just 1% of that year's ethanol consumption.|$|E
