5|$|A famous story, {{possibly}} apocryphal, {{states that}} during the Battle of Princeton, when Alexander Hamilton, then the commander of an artillery battery, ordered his cannons to fire upon the British soldiers taking refuge in Nassau Hall, one of the cannonballs was shot through {{the head of the}} portrait of King George II <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> the chapel, which was subsequently replaced with a portrait of George Washington.|$|E
5|$|Oasis {{evolved from}} an earlier band called the Rain, {{composed}} of Paul McGuigan (bass guitar), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Tony McCarroll (drums) and Chris Hutton (vocals). Unsatisfied with Hutton, Arthurs invited and auditioned acquaintance Liam Gallagher as a replacement. Liam suggested that the band name be changed to Oasis. This change was inspired by an Inspiral Carpets tour poster <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> the Gallagher brothers' bedroom. One of the venues the poster listed was the Oasis Leisure Centre in Swindon.|$|E

500|$|The {{sound was}} {{provided}} by Solotech. Front of house engineer Blake Suib explained that, [...] " [...] and Solotech were asked {{to come up with}} a design that blocked the least amount of seats but provided the quality and coverage that [...] expects and that we were looking for". The public address (PA) was made of 64 Milos that split into four hangs of 16 per hang. Two at the 50 yard line pointed one way and directly behind, two at the 50 yard line pointed the opposite way. Also present were 32 Micas; 16 per hang, pointing to the sides. Each one of the four hangs had its own equalization (EQ) and level control, so in case one of the speakers were louder there would be a separate EQ to compensate for any change in the tone due to the distance. All the components and tools used in the public address were designed by Meyer Sound Laboratories, including a software called Mapp, used to decide where to point the PA; the Simm, to analyze and time align the PA accurately; and the Galileo, used to EQ and balance all the sections of the PA. The speakers were self-powered with amplifiers also built by Meyer Sounds. There were 24 HP700 subwoofers positioned all over the arena floor, and the Simm and Galileo were used to time align. Spears used a Crown CM-311AE headset microphone wearing the mic's beltpack (usually hidden in color matching material) on her top or pants, she did not use in-ear monitors; instead 12 Meyer CQs were positioned, eight flown around the center ring and two on each of the smaller stages. Spears specifically asked Suib to make the show sound similar to a dance club. Solotech provided the lighting package, including a mostly Vari-Lite rig, with 80 each VL3000s and VL3500s in various positions, and 60 VL500s built into the stage deck. Whitehouse also had 18 PRG Bad Boy luminaires, 16 of which sat in pods <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> various positions lower than the rest of the rig, with two more at either end of the stage. Each of the eight pods housed two Bad Boys, two of the VL3500s, one Robert Juliat Ivanhoe followspot with scroller under DMX control, and a Molefay. Fifty Martin Professional Atomic Color strobes and four front of house Robert Juliat Aramis followspots rounded out the lighting package. The lightning team had to rehearse for a month to prepare. The tour was also the first to use the touring version of the PRG Virtuoso V676 console to control the system, which was used from the beginning of the European leg until the end of the tour. Pyrotechnics and jets of smoke used in the show were created by Lorenzo Cornacchia of Pyrotek Special Effects and Tait Towers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{curtains}} rose while backstage personnel {{hastened to}} bring the fire under control, the actors beginning the scene. After speaking a few lines, Claxton was {{made aware of the}} fire by Lillian Cleaves, another actress backstage who was standing behind the box set. She whispered sotto voce through the canvas of the boathouse that there was fire on stage and urged them to leave. Kate Claxton recalled peering up through the flimsy canvas of the box set and seeing “sparks falling and little tongues of the fire licking the edges of the drops and borders <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> the flies.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Extensive renovations {{were done}} to the cathedral in the early 1990s. [...] These renovations were made {{possible}} through {{the result of the}} generosity of parishioner Elizabeth Kahl-Figge who included the parish in her will. [...] This included replacing the roof and repainting the interior of the church. [...] The painting of St. Margaret of Scotland <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> St Margaret's Chapel was repaired and hung in the cathedral. [...] The painting dates to 1873 and is the work of Johann Schmitt. It was originally hung in the high altar of the old cathedral. The painting was severely damaged when it was removed from the old church. It was restored in 1990 at the Intermuseum Laboratory in Oberlin, Ohio.|$|E
2500|$|The subways of New York {{are also}} {{occasional}} venues for beauty pageants and guerrilla theater. The MTA's annual Miss Subways contest ran from 1941 to 1976 {{and again in}} 2004 (under the revised name [...] "Ms Subways"). Past Miss Subways winners include Eleanor Nash, an FBI clerk described by her poster <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> subway cars in 1960 as [...] "young, beautiful and expert with a rifle." [...] The 2004 Ms Subways winner, Caroline Sanchez-Bernat, was an actress who {{played a role in}} Sunday Brunch 4. The 35-minute piece of performance art was a full enactment of a Sunday brunch — including crisp white tablecloth, spinach salad appetizer and attentive waiter in black tuxedo — performed aboard a southbound A train in 2000. With subway riders looking on, the actors chatted amiably about Christmas, exchanged gifts and signed for a package delivered by a United Parcel Service delivery man who entered the scene at the West 34th Street stop.|$|E

2500|$|Despite her {{religious}} upbringing, Ruiz describes {{herself at the}} time as a skeptic and a [...] "Sunday morning Catholic". [...] A successful, sophisticated woman, Ruiz was embarrassed by Reyes' religiosity and was jealous of his affection for the dark-skinned Virgin. [...] While her husband was gone, Ruiz almost took down the icon of the Virgin of Guadalupe (painted by Reyes) <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> their home. [...] She decided to leave it up, however, and the next day as she walked past the painting, she heard it wish her a good morning. [...] She dismissed the greeting as a figment of her imagination or a signal of mental instability. [...] The next week, the painting greeted her again, and Ruiz felt a sensation that the voice was coming from the Virgin Mary. [...] Following the two auditory experiences, Ruiz began waking up early with a strong desire to attend six o'clock mass. [...] By the time Reyes returned, he found his wife much more open to his spirituality, and when he asked for her help to spiritually revitalize the family, she agreed.|$|E
2500|$|Wentworth Woodhouse was {{inherited}} by Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham, briefly Prime Minister in 1765–66 {{and again}} in 1782. He received Benjamin Franklin here in 1771. The architect he employed at the house was John Carr of York, who [...] added an extra storey to parts of the East Front and provided the porticoes to the matching wings, each {{the equivalent of a}} moderately grand country house. James [...] "Athenian" [...] Stuart contributed designs for panels in the Pillared Hall. The Whistlejacket Room was named for George Stubbs' portrait <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> it of Whistlejacket, {{one of the most famous}} racehorses of all time. The additions were completed in 1772. The second Marquess envisaged a sculpture gallery at the house, which never came to fruition; four marbles by Joseph Nollekens were carried out to his commission, in expectation of the gallery; the Diana, signed and dated 1778, is now at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Juno, Venus and Minerva, grouped with a Roman antique marble of Paris, are at the J. Paul Getty Museum.|$|E

50|$|Often another Germania {{painting}} {{is attributed to}} Veit, too: <b>that</b> painting <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> the St. Paul's Church in the years 1848 and 1849 when the German National Assembly gathered in Frankfurt.
