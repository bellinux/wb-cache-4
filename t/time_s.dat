40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} several {{important aspects of}} the structure theory of the recently introduced quasi-Hopf superalgebras (QHSAs), which play a fundamental role in knot theory and integrable systems. In particular we introduce the opposite structure and prove in detail (for the graded case) Drinfeld 2 ̆ 7 s result that the coproduct Delta 2 ̆ 7 =_ (<b>S</b> circle <b>times</b> <b>S)</b> (.) T (.) Delta (.) S- 1 induced on a QHSA is obtained from the coproduct Delta by twisting. The corresponding "Drinfeld twist" F-D is explicitly constructed, as well as its inverse, and we investigate the complete QHSA associated with Delta 2 ̆ 7. We give a universal proof that the coassociator Phi 2 ̆ 7 = (<b>S</b> circle <b>times</b> <b>S</b> circle <b>times</b> <b>S)</b> Phi (321) and canonical elements alpha 2 ̆ 7 = S(beta), beta 2 ̆ 7 = S(alpha) correspond to twisting, the original coassociator Phi = Phi (123) and canonical elements alpha, beta with the Drinfeld twist F-D. Moreover in the quasi-tri angular case, it is shown algebraically that the R-matrix R 2 ̆ 7 = (<b>S</b> circle <b>times</b> <b>S)</b> R corresponds to twisting the original R-matrix R with F-D. This has important consequences in knot theory, which will be investigated elsewhere...|$|R
