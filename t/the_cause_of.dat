However, the evidence did not allow the court to determine <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the total loss of engine power.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} the impact <b>of</b> assessing <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> interindividual variation within a population when the research question of interest is about <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> differences between populations or time periods. This discrepancy between the research focus and the research question {{is referred to as}} a type III error, one that provides the right answer for the wrong question. METHODS: Homelessness, obesity, and infant mortality were used to illustrate different consequences of type III errors. These different consequences depend on the relationships between <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> within- and between-group variation. CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> inter-individual variation and <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> variation between populations and time periods may be distinct.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the factors precipitating insomnia as perceived by low cadre company workers in Nigeria. A total of 200 workers from Nigerian bottling company Owerri in Imo State and Abia State, aged 26 - 55 years participated in the study. From the sampled population of 200 participants representing equal number {{of males and females}} were drawn through systematic random sampling for analysis. A multivariate design was employed to test the hypotheses. The findings showed that incessant use of sleeping pills contributed 43 % significantly to <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> insomnia. Environmental factors contributed 22 % significantly to <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> insomnia. Psychiatric symptoms contributed 16 % significantly to <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> insomnia, substance abuse contributed 8 % significantly to <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> insomnia and gender differences contributed 7 % significantly to <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> insomnia. <b>The</b> remaining 4 % accounted for the factors not considered in this study...|$|R

50|$|The Domar Serfdom Model is a mid-to-late 20th century {{model that}} {{develops}} a hypothesis concerning <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> agricultural slavery or serfdom in historical societies.

The Domar Serfdom Model revives a hypothesis originally suggested by Russian Historian Vasily Klyuchevsky, who looks at <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> slavery through <b>the</b> lens of the Russian experience in the 16th and 17th centuries. In his revisiting of the hypothesis, Domar aims to give it wider applicability while focusing more on an analysis that yields an economic model as an explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> slavery.|$|R
