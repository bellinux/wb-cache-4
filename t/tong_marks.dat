40|$|In {{contrast}} to the wealth of saliency models in the vision literature, there is a relative paucity of models exploring auditory saliency. In this work, we integrate the approaches of (Kayser, Petkov, Lippert, & Logothetis, 2005) and (Zhang, <b>Tong,</b> <b>Marks,</b> Shan, & Cottrell, 2008) and propose a model of auditory saliency. The model combines the statistics of natural soundscapes and the recent past of the input signal to predict the saliency of an auditory stimulus in the frequency domain. To evaluate the model output, a simple behavioral experiment was performed. Results show the auditory saliency maps calculated by the model to be in excellent accord with human judgments of saliency...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion that}} novelty attracts {{attention}} is core to many accounts of visual saliency. However, a consensus {{has not been}} reached on how to best define novelty. Various interpretations of novelty lead to different bottom-up saliency models that have been proposed for static images and more recently for dynamic scenes. In previous work, we assumed that a basic goal of the visual system is to locate targets such as predators and food that are potentially important for survival, and developed a probabilistic model of salience (Zhang, <b>Tong,</b> <b>Marks,</b> Shan, & Cottrell, 2008). The probabilistic description of this goal naturally leads a definition of novelty as self-information, an idea that has appeared in other work. However, our notion uses {{the idea that the}} statistics used to determine novelty are learned from prior experience, rather than on the current image, leading to an efficient implementation that explains several search asymmetries other models fail to predict. In this paper, we generalize our saliency framework to dynamic scenes and develop a simple, efficient, and online bottom-up saliency algorithm. Our algorithm matches the performance of more complex state of the art algorithms in predicting human fixations during free-viewing of videos...|$|E

50|$|Hiến Tông died in 1341 {{leaving no}} heir. Minh Tông {{therefore}} passed the throne to his tenth son, Trần Hạo, now Dụ Tông. For the next sixteen years, the Retired Emperor continued to wield real power over Trần Dynasty while the Emperor reigned only nominally. Minh Tông died in 1357, {{and he was}} posthumously named as Chương nghiêu văn triết hoàng đế (章堯文哲皇帝). The death of Minh <b>Tông</b> also <b>marked</b> {{the end of a}} prosperous and stable era of Đại Việt under the Trần Dynasty, and the country began to decline as the royal court and Trần clan soon fell into chaos.|$|R

In North America, a tong (...) {{is a type}} of {{organization}} found among Chinese living in the United States and Canada. These organizations are described as secret societies or sworn brotherhoods and are often tied to criminal activity. In the 1990s, in most American Chinatowns, clearly <b>marked</b> <b>tong</b> halls could easily be found, many of which have had affiliations with Chinese crime gangs.|$|R

50|$|TVI's (Television International) Senior Manager of {{accounting}} Lam Siu-siu (Teresa Mo) meets TVI's Director of production Koo Hiu-san (Wayne Lai) {{when he calls}} her into a meeting, asking why none of his requested work equipment has been approved for budget. Siu-siu calmly explains that due to errors his assistant <b>Tong</b> Chong-shu (<b>Mark</b> Ma) had in filing the paperwork, they missed the deadline before the fiscal quarter ends, and the account department will not approve any new budget request. Hiu-san, who {{has a reputation as}} a mean boss, demands to have the issue resolved right away, but Siu-siu tells him to schedule another meeting with her as it is late and nearly time to end work. Unimpressed with rationale, Hiu-san mocks Siu-siu for leaving work with the issue unresolved. Hiu-san's comments backfire when Siu-siu mocks him back by hinting that his department is unorganized and then telling him the available executive secretary position in his department has been unfilled for so long because no one wants to work for him.|$|R

As the last emperor in the prosperous period of Trần dynasty, Minh Tông {{was known for his}} {{successful}} reign of Đại Việt with the assistance of many talented mandarins. Minh Tông was also the longest-reigning retired emperor in history of Vietnam when he acted as a regent and co-ruled with Hiến Tông and Dụ <b>Tông.</b> His death <b>marked</b> a significant turning point {{in the history of the}} Trần Dynasty, as the country began to decline and soon fell into troubled times.|$|R
