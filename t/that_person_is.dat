Recent research into the genetics of AML {{has resulted in the}} availability of tests that can predict which drug or drugs may work best for a particular person, as well as how long <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> likely to survive. The treatment and prognosis of AML differ from those of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in part because the cellular differentiation is not the same; AML involves higher percentages of dedifferentiated and undifferentiated cells, including more blasts (myeloblasts, monoblasts, and megakaryoblasts).|$|E
5|$|We {{were trying}} to avoid that whole game of who gets in first with the reviews. These days there's so much paper to fill, or digital paper to fill, that whoever writes the first few things gets cut and pasted. Whoever gets their opinion in first has all that power.

25|$|For example, if {{a person}} hears an {{explosion}} and sees a tree fall down <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> likely to infer that the explosion caused the tree to fall over. However, if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down (that is, the first requirement is not met), or rather than an explosion, the person hears the ring of a telephone (that is, the second requirement is not met), then <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> not likely to infer that either noise caused the tree to fall down.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a special}} honor to receive the last aliyah of the Book of Deuteronomy; the person {{receiving}} that aliyah is called the Hatan Torah (the groom of the Torah) (or Kallat Torah (the bride of the Torah) in synagogues that allow women to receive an aliyah). Likewise, it {{is a special}} honor to receive the first aliyah of the Book of Genesis; <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> called Hatan B'reishit (the groom of Genesis) (or Kallat B'reishit (the bride of Genesis)).|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} Tikkun olam (Repairing the World) {{is central to}} modern Rabbinic Judaism. Tikkun olam is {{accomplished}} through various means, such as ritualistically performing God's commandments, charity and social justice, {{as well as through}} example persuading {{the rest of the world}} to behave morally. According to some views, Tikkun Olam would result in the beginning of the Messianic Age. It has been said that in every generation, a person is born with the potential to be the spiritual Messiah. If the time is right for the Messianic Age within that person's lifetime, then that person will be the mashiach. But if that person dies before he completes the mission of the Messiah, then <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> not the Messiah (Mashiach).|$|E

25|$|There {{are various}} {{justifications}} for the exemption of the insane from criminal responsibility. When mental incapacity is successfully raised as a defence {{in a criminal}} trial it absolves a defendant from liability: it applies public policies in relation to criminal responsibility by applying a rationale of compassion, accepting that it is morally wrong to punish a person if <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> deprived permanently or temporarily of the capacity to form a necessary mental intent that {{the definition of a}} crime requires. Punishment of the obviously mentally ill by the state may undermine public confidence in the penal system. A utilitarian and humanitarian approach suggests that the interests of society are better served by treatment of the illness rather than punishment of the individual.|$|E
25|$|Ajaan Maha Bua, on {{the other}} hand, saw what he {{considered}} {{to be a lot of}} strange ideas being taught about meditation in Bangkok in the later decades of the 20th century. For that reason Ajaan Maha Bua decided to vividly describe how each noble attainment is reached, even though doing so indirectly revealed that he was confident he had attained a noble level. Though the Vinaya prohibits a monk from directly revealing ones own or another's attainments to laypeople while <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> still alive, Ajaan Maha Bua wrote in Ajaan Mun's posthumous biography that he was convinced that Ajaan Mun was an arahant. Thanissaro Bhikkhu remarks that this was a significant change of the teaching etiquette within the Forest Tradition.|$|E
25|$|Yet another {{explanation}} of the high correlation between extraversion and happiness comes from the study by Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen (2002). They suggested that the core element of extraversion {{is a tendency to}} behave in ways that attract, hold, and enjoy social attention, and not reward sensitivity. They claimed that one of the fundamental qualities of social attention is its potential of being rewarding. Therefore, if a person shows positive emotions of enthusiasm, energy, and excitement, <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> seen favorably by others and he or she gains others' attention. This favorable reaction from others likely encourages extraverts to engage in further extraverted behavior. Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen's (2002) study showed that their measure of social attention, the Social Attention Scale, was much more highly correlated with extraversion than were measures of reward sensitivity.|$|E

25|$|In its call-and-response singing set to ostinato-based rhythms {{played on}} {{two or three}} squat drums (barriles), bomba resembles other neo-African genres in the Caribbean. Of clear African {{provenance}} is its format in which a single person emerges from an informal circle of singers to dance {{in front of the}} drummers, engaging the lead drummer in a sort of playful duel; after dancing for a while, <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> then replaced by another. While various such elements can be traced to origins in Africa or elsewhere, bomba must be regarded as a local Afro-Puerto Rican creation. Its rhythms (e.g. seis corrido, yubá, leró, etc.), dance moves, and song lyrics that sometimes mimic farm animals(in Spanish, with some French creole words in eastern Puerto Rico) collectively constitute a unique Puerto Rican genre.|$|E
25|$|However, she reveals she {{has been}} working with Vetch all along, who appears and congratulates her on her deception. Vetch tells Haven that Chess is one of his spies, {{deployed}} throughout his slave colonies to keep watch for anyone speaking of the Golden Voice. Vetch explains he had Chess call Haven away from the Mount of Sighs immediately after ringing the bell because the legend says that if the person who rings the bell does not remain on the Mount until Athellion's return, Athellion must return to wherever <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> - thus Vetch plans to wait until Athellion appears to Haven, and then kill him. With no more use for Chess, Vetch decides she can die with Haven. At this moment, Athellion arrives, telling Vetch he will surrender if Haven and Chess are spared. Vetch agrees, imprisoning them, and bringing Athellion back to the Mount of Sighs.|$|E
25|$|Jainism is the {{religion}} of the followers of Mahavira. He {{is said to be the}} 24th Tirthankara, or the 24th in a line of teachers espousing Jain principles. Jains reject the Vedas and highlight the practice of austerity. Jain faith states that the jiva, or soul, can escape the cycle of rebirth and death through strict ethical behavior. When nothing remains but the purity of the jiva, <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> called a jina, or winner, which is the origin of the term Jain. Karma is viewed as an accumulation that burdens the soul, causing attachment and suffering. Ahimsa, or non-violence, is central to Jain faith and practice. It is interpreted very strictly as prohibiting all forms of harm to other living beings. Due to this, Jainism requires a strict vegetarian lifestyle. Ahimsa also applies to speaking, as one's words can cause harm and suffering.Fisher (1997). Pp 116-117.Rausch & Key (1993).|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} process for selecting {{the leader of}} the Conservative Party is overseen by the Conservative 1922 Committee, although election procedures are approved by the Board of the Conservative Party. Nominations for the leadership are invited by the Chairman of the 1922 Committee (currently Graham Brady), acting as Returning Officer for all stages of the election. Candidates must be proposed and seconded in writing, with names of the proposers and seconders being published. When nominations close, a list of valid nominations is published. If there is only one valid nomination, <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> declared elected. If only two valid nominations are received, both names go forward to the general membership of the Party. If more than two nominations are received, a ballot is held within the Parliamentary Party on the Tuesday immediately following the closing date for nominations. An exhaustive ballot system is used to select two candidates to go forward to the general membership of the Party.|$|E
25|$|The temple {{ceremony}} involves {{entering into}} solemn covenants. Critics {{have expressed concern}} that a person may be denied access to the specific details of these covenants until <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> faced with making them in the temple, {{making it impossible to}} reflect on their meaning or ramifications. The LDS Church does offer a temple preparation seminar and freely publishes both the student booklet, Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple, and the teacher's manual, Endowed from on High: Temple Preparation Seminar, on its website. These books and the seminar which may be held are designed to help prepare members for the temple; attendance at the seminar is often required before a bishop will issue a temple recommend {{for the first time to}} a member. In the seminar, it is taught that all of the covenants entered into during the endowment have a basis in Latter-day Saint scripture; however, the specifics of the covenants are not revealed.|$|E
25|$|For example, we {{have two}} {{patients}} who are taking codeine for pain relief. Codeine is a prodrug, so it requires conversion from its inactive form to its active form. The active form of codeine is morphine, which provides the therapeutic effect of pain relief. If person A receives one *1 allele each from mother and father to code for the CYP2D6 gene, then <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> considered to have an extensive metabolizer (EM) phenotype, as allele *1 is considered to have a normal-function (this would be represented as CYP2D6 *1/*1). If person B {{on the other hand}} had received one *1 allele from the mother and a *4 allele from the father, that individual would be an Intermediate Metabolizer (IM) (the genotype would be CYP2D6 *1/*4). Although both individuals are taking the same dose of codeine, person B could potentially lack the therapeutic benefits of codeine due to the decreased conversion rate of codeine to its active counterpart morphine.|$|E
