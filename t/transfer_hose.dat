50|$|By {{the summer}} of 2001 Pentland Ferries were ready to start regular sailings with their vessel the MV Pentalina-B to St Margaret's Hope. It was soon {{realised}} that even with these improvements {{there would still be}} problems and that a much longer pier would be needed. Fortunately an old floating dock was available for disposal at Lerwick. This was purchased, towed to St Margaret's Hope, where it was cleaned of all contaminants and then towed to Gills Bay where it was sunk to form a continuation of the pier thus greatly increasing its length. Old oil <b>transfer</b> <b>hoses</b> from the Scapa Flow oil terminal were used as fenders for the ferry while rock armour was dumped on the seaward side for protection against the waves. The tanks have been filled with concrete and the dock itself filled with the spoil from dredging to make more room for the ferry to manoeuvre. By the time all this work is finished the dock will be incorporated into the pier.At present it is designated as a wreck and exhibits two green lights at its seaward end, rather than a pier which shows two red lights. As all this work is funded by the ferry company at present (2006), work continues slowly as finances permit. It is planned to continue dredging to make sufficient room for a ferry to turn round if need be and then possibly extend the pier again at an angle at the seaward end to stop the swell which is sometimes too great for work at the linkspan. This will not be before {{the summer of}} 2008.|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} {{contributes to}} the LNG supply chain {{by the development of}} a validated calculation model for corrugated flexible hoses or pipes developed for LNG Transfer. The model builds upon experience gained by TNO Technical Sciences (Fluid Dynamics) in a large number of flow tests carried out on hoses in a large range of diameters from 4 to 18 -inch. LNG transfer rates are in general relatively high as the time involved should be limited from economical point of view. In large scale offshore LNG transfer, flow rates up to 5000 m 3 /h are applied and in future flow rates up to 10. 000 m 3 /h are foreseen. Typical values mentioned for offshore operations in tandem transfer range from 50 to 150 meters hose length and hose diameter up to 20 -inch. The pressure losses in LNG offshore transfer, but also in smaller scale applications, can be considerable. The pressure loss depends on flow rate, length of the hose, internal diameter and internal hose corrugation geometry. High pressure losses will impose additional requirements on LNG pumps and might result in cavitation at the downstream end of the hose as the average pressure drops below vapor pressure. Furthermore the impact of local boiling phenomena due to heat-ingress and cavitation, possibly effected by vortex shedding along the internal corrugations, is not known. Once the gaps in the data base are filled a validated prediction model is available, which can be used in guidelines and standards. So far the EN 1474 (part 2 : Design and testing of <b>transfer</b> <b>hoses)</b> does not specify a maximum allowable pressure loss and the prescription of the requirement for the test is limited: "Flow rate testing (ambient or cryogenic) : demonstrate that the hose is capable of operating at its maximum flow rate and confirm the predicted head loss " The final goal of the project is to obtain a validated prediction model for the calculation of pressure losses in LNG transfer with flexible multi-composite and metal hoses based on input of parameters as operating conditions and hose geometry. Also input for guidelines and standards in LNG transfer with flexibles such as EN 1474 will be generated, which can be used in for qualification of LNG equipment...|$|R

40|$|Extravehicular {{activities}} (EVAs) require high-pressure, high-purity oxygen. Shuttle EVAs use oxygen that {{is stored}} and transported as a cryogenic fluid. EVAs on the International Space Station (ISS) presently use the Shuttle cryo O 2, which is {{transported to the}} ISS using a <b>transfer</b> <b>hose.</b> The fluid is compressed to elevated pressures and stored as a high-pressure gas. With the retirement of the shuttle, NASA has been searching for ways to deliver oxygen to fill the highpressure oxygen tanks on the ISS. A method was developed using low-pressure oxygen generated onboard the ISS and released into ISS cabin air, filtering the oxygen from ISS cabin air using a pressure swing absorber to generate a low-pressure (high-purity) oxygen stream, compressing the oxygen with a mechanical compressor, and transferring the high-pressure, high-purity oxygen to ISS storage tanks. The pressure swing absorber (PSA) can be either a two-stage device, or a single-stage device, {{depending on the type}} of sorbent used. The key is to produce a stream with oxygen purity greater than 99. 5 percent. The separator can be a PSA device, or a VPSA device (that uses both vacuum and pressure for the gas separation). The compressor is a multi-stage mechanical compressor. If the gas flow rates are on the order of 5 to 10 lb (. 2. 3 to 4. 6 kg) per day, the compressor can be relatively small [3 ~ 16 ~ 16 in. (. 8 ~ 41 ~ 41 cm) ]. Any spacecraft system, or other remote location that has a supply of lowpressure oxygen, a method of separating oxygen from cabin air, and a method of compressing the enriched oxygen stream, has the possibility of having a regenerable supply of highpressure, high-purity oxygen that is compact, simple, and safe. If cabin air is modified so there is very little argon, the separator can be smaller, simpler, and use less power...|$|E
40|$|Some {{years ago}} a root cause {{analysis}} was made of a large oil spill caused by a leak in an oil offloading system. It appeared that the leak {{was caused by a}} large pressure pulse initiated by the sudden closure of the bow loading valve at the tanker, called water hammer. The magnitude of the initial pulse was largely amplified by reflections at several diameter changes. Similar phenomena can occur in (offshore) LNG transfer systems with even more serious consequences. In addition to the water hammer "column separation" may cause even larger pressure pulses. This occurs when, due to a passing water hammer wave, the pressure locally drops to the vapor pressure and the liquid starts to boil. As the LNG in a transfer system is close to its boiling conditions, this phenomenon is likely to occur. In order to evaluate to what extent water hammer and column separation can endanger the integrity of the system a computer model has been made of three generic ship-to-ship transfer systems. The peak pressures during an emergency release of the flexible <b>transfer</b> <b>hose</b> at full flow have been calculated. The sensitivity for length of the hose, closure time and wave propagation speed has been evaluated. In spite of the modeling uncertainties the results show that water hammer and column separation can cause shock loads that are an order of magnitude larger than the static loads. Therefore it is recommended to perform an analysis as part of the design and to optimize the layout of the system. It is suggested to include this as a requirement in the applicable design codes. Also it is recommended to test components such as flexible hoses on dynamic loads caused by water hammer...|$|E
40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was {{requested}} {{to develop a}} bench scale test facility, using a mixer, transfer pump, and transfer line to determine the impact of conveying the grout through the transfer lines to the vault on grout properties. Bench scale testing focused on the effect the transfer line has on the rheological property of the grout as it was processed through the transfer line. Rheological and other physical properties of grout samples were obtained prior to and after pumping through a transfer line. The Bench Scale Mixing Rig (BSMR) consisted of two mixing tanks, grout feed tank, transfer pump and <b>transfer</b> <b>hose.</b> The mixing tanks were used to batch the grout which was then transferred into the grout feed tank. The contents of the feed tank were then pumped through the transfer line (hose) using a progressive cavity pump. The grout flow rate and pump discharge pressure were monitored. Four sampling stations were located {{along the length of}} the transfer line at the 5, 105 and 205 feet past the transfer pump and at 305 feet, the discharge of the hose. Scaling between the full scale piping at Saltstone to bench scale testing at SRNL was performed by maintaining the same shear rate and total shear at the wall of the transfer line. The results of scaling down resulted in a shorter transfer line, a lower average velocity, the same transfer time and similar pressure drops. The condition of flow in the bench scale transfer line is laminar. The flow in the full scale pipe is in the transition region, but is more laminar than turbulent. The resulting plug in laminar flow in the bench scale results in a region of no-mixing. Hence mixing, or shearing, at the bench scale should be less than that observed in the full scale, where this plug is non existent due to the turbulent flow. The bench scale tests should be considered to be conservative due to the highly laminar condition of flow that exists. Two BSMR runs were performed. In both cases, wall shearing was shown to reduce the rheological properties of the grout as it was processed through the transfer line. Samples taken at the static feed tank showed that gelling impacted the rheological properties of the grout before it was fed into the pump and transfer line. A comparison of the rheological properties of samples taken at the feed tank and transfer line discharge indicated shearing of the grout was occurring in the transfer line. Bench scale testing of different mixing methods with three different salt solutions showed that method of mixing influences the rheological properties of the grouts. The paddle blade mixing method of the salt solution used for the BMSR testing provided comparable rheological properties of the grout prepared in the BMSR after 14 minutes of processing, B 3. The paddle blade mixing method can be used to represent BMSR results and mixing time can be adjusted to represent larger scale mixing...|$|E

RPP- 6028, Specification for <b>Hose</b> in <b>Hose</b> <b>Transfer</b> Lines for Hanford's Interim Stabilization Program, has been issued to define the specific requirements for the design, manufacture, and verification of transfer line assemblies for specific waste transfer applications. Included in RPP- 6028 are tables defining the chemical constituents of concern to which transfer lines will be exposed. Current Interim Stabilization Program planning forecasts that the at-grade transfer lines {{will be required to}} convey pumpable waste for as much as three years after commissioning. Prudent engineering dictates that the equipment placed in service have a working life in excess of this forecasted time period, with some margin to allow for future adjustments to the planned schedule. This document evaluates the effective service life of the Hose-in-Hose Transfer Lines, based on information submitted by the manufacturer and published literature. The effective service life of transfer line assemblies is a function of several factors. Foremost among these are process fluid characteristics, ambient environmental conditions, and the manufacturer's stated shelf life.
