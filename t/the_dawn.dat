Li Guojie, chairman of Dawning Information Industry Company and director and academician of the ICT, said {{research and development of}} <b>the</b> <b>Dawning</b> 6000 is expected to be completed in two years. By then, Chinese-made high-performance computers will be expected to achieve two major breakthroughs: first, the adoption of domestically made processors; second, the existing cluster-based system structure of high-performance computers will be changed once performance reaches 1 PFLOPS.|$|R

5|$|Wade {{has written}} for The New York Times since 1981 as an {{editorial}} writer, science editor and a reporter, including articles supporting the idea of recent human evolution and racial differentiation. His motivation for writing Before <b>the</b> <b>Dawn</b> began during his reporting of genetics, particularly since the sequencing {{of the human genome}} in 2003, as he started to realise how it could be related to the human past. He sought to put all of the recent research of archaeology, paleoanthropology and linguistics together into one narrative revolving around genetics. Before <b>the</b> <b>Dawn</b> was published in hardcover in 2006, and then in an updated paperback in 2007, by the Penguin Group.|$|E

5|$|Whereas the {{dynamics}} of Jovian magnetosphere mainly depend on internal sources of energy, the solar wind probably has a role as well, particularly {{as a source of}} high-energy protons. The structure of the outer magnetosphere shows some features of a solar wind-driven magnetosphere, including a significant dawn–dusk asymmetry. In particular, magnetic field lines in the dusk sector are bent in the opposite direction to those in <b>the</b> <b>dawn</b> sector. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>dawn</b> magnetosphere contains open field lines connecting to the magnetotail, whereas in the dusk magnetosphere, the field lines are closed. All these observations indicate that a solar wind driven reconnection process, known on Earth as the Dungey cycle, may also be taking place in the Jovian magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|While a few critics praised {{elements}} of its composition and execution, <b>The</b> <b>Dawn</b> of Love was very poorly received when first exhibited. Etty {{had developed a}} reputation for painting realistic figures, and his stylised Venus was thought unduly influenced by foreign artists such as Rubens {{as well as being}} overly voluptuous and unrealistically coloured, while the painting as a whole was considered tasteless and obscene. <b>The</b> <b>Dawn</b> of Love was not among the 133 paintings exhibited in the major 1849 retrospective exhibition of Etty's works, and its exhibition in Glasgow in 1899 drew complaints for its supposed obscenity. In 1889 it was bought by Sir Merton Russell-Cotes, and has remained {{in the collection of the}} Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum ever since.|$|E
