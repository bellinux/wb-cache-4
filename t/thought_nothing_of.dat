5|$|He was {{the most}} amazing and ingenious combat pilot I ever saw. He was also very lucky on many occasions. He <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> jumping into a fight outnumbered ten to one, often alone, with us {{trying to catch up}} to him. He {{violated}} every cardinal rule of fighter combat. He abandoned all the rules.|$|E
5|$|The BBC Film Library, meanwhile, had no {{responsibility}} for storing programmes that had not originated on film, and there were conflicting views between the Film Library and BBC Enterprises over which party held the responsibility for archiving programmes. As each body believed it the other's responsibility to archive the material, each <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> destroying its own copies as necessary. This lack of communication contributed to the erasure {{of much of the}} Corporation's film archive of older black-and-white programming. While thousands of other programmes have been destroyed in this way around the world, the missing Doctor Who episodes are probably the best-known example of how the lack of a consistent programme archiving policy risks permanent loss.|$|E
5|$|The Jackson-Rowe {{friendship}} {{would last}} for several years, {{during which time}} Rowe married and divorced Richard Edelman, a man she claimed to have felt trapped by. Rowe and the musician would both {{talk to each other}} about their unhappy marriages; his with Presley and hers with Edelman, a teacher at Hollywood High School. Like Jackson's first wife, Rowe supported the entertainer when he was accused of child sexual abuse. Jackson kept his friendship with Rowe a secret from his wife, who eventually found out but <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> it; she felt the dermatologist's assistant was not her husband's type because she was not glamorous enough.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} moments Maggie felt <b>nothing,</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing,</b> {{but that she}} had {{suddenly}} passed away from that life which she had been dreading; it was the transition of death, without its agony,--and she {{was alone in the}} darkness with God.|$|R
60|$|She {{clasped her}} hands and broke into a sob, like a frightened child; she <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> but <b>of</b> meeting Lucy, and seeing her look of pained {{surprise}} and doubt, perhaps of just upbraiding.|$|R
60|$|I <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> more <b>of</b> his movements, but {{continued}} {{to look over the}} books, Mr. Mason meanwhile being busy at his desk in a smaller office beyond. Presently I heard my uncle's well-known step, and hurried out, meeting him just after he had been in his private office, which was behind all the others.|$|R
25|$|In late 1999, Wallace began feeling {{intermittently}} ill. Family members variously {{remember him}} as acting unsteady, coughing and seeming swollen. As his inexplicable sickness persisted over the holiday season, his family {{encouraged him to}} seek medical care, but he died in early 2000 before he could do so. Their daughter Ashley was 11 {{at the time and}} had been alone with him. She blamed herself for his death. She had noticed his ill appearance that day, but <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|E
25|$|Spruance was {{an active}} man who <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> walking eight or 10 miles a day. He was fond of symphonic music, and his tastes were {{generally}} simple. He never smoked, and drank little. He enjoyed hot chocolate and would make it for himself every morning. Besides his family, he loved the companionship of his pet schnauzer, Peter. Fit into his 70s, Spruance {{spent most of his}} retirement days wearing old khakis and work shoes and working in his garden and greenhouse; he loved to show them to visitors.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, in a semi-finals {{match on}} 17 September 1949, {{in which he}} kicked nine goals for Belgrave, he was knocked out during the match. He <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> the injury and, {{thinking}} it was just concussion, he sought no additional medical treatment. On 4 October, he collapsed at work, and was hospitalized. At the hospital, {{it was discovered that}} he had fractured his skull (the second time that he had fractured his skull in his football career). He immediately retired from football, having set the goal-kicking record of 152 goals in a single season.|$|E

60|$|And thus sitting, a {{watch in}} his hand, fat, and smooth, and golden, like a {{flattened}} globe of butter, he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1690, the Great Parlour Chamber was {{occupied}} by John Batt. It has a garderobe or toilet in the outer wall. The rush matting in this and other family rooms was a feature of wealthy households, and was warmer than bare floorboards or stone floors. The fireplace is a 19th-century addition, one of few interior structural changes made since the 17th century. The inclusion of a table and chairs in a bed chamber in the 17th century was not unusual. Bed chambers had a dual purpose where their occupiers <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> entertaining guests with wine or cards.|$|E
500|$|Wolters {{was born}} into a Catholic family in Coesfeld, Germany on August 3, 1903, the son of an {{architect}} who had married the daughter of a master carpenter in the shipbuilding trade. [...] In his privately published memoirs, Segments of a Life, Wolters described his father as [...] "a serious, conscientious and diligent man, always concerned about the future". [...] Wolters regarded his mother as [...] "a highly practical woman, full of zest for life, who in hard times <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> serving a delicious roast without letting on it was horsemeat". [...] Wolters passed a generally happy childhood, punctuated by the chaos of the war years, and by a childhood illness that resulted in his being taught at home for a year by two priests.|$|E
2500|$|An 18-year-old man, Joe Kutcher, saw the {{streetcar}} move onto {{the bridge and}} <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> it, until he heard someone behind him shout [...] "Stop that car!" ...|$|E

60|$|Suddenly a word {{reached his}} ear--just a name flippantly spoken by spiteful lips--and {{it changed the}} whole trend of his thoughts. Since he had risen that morning he had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> but <b>of</b> Jeanne, and--in {{connection}} with her--of Percy and his vain quest of her. Now that name spoken by some one unknown brought his mind back to more definite thoughts of his chief.|$|R

2500|$|Elvis Presley {{reportedly}} spent {{days and}} nights with his friends and employees from the Memphis Mafia. They were a big family and Elvis lived in a [...] "milieu of a protective brotherhood." [...] Gerald Marzorati says that Elvis [...] "couldn't go anywhere else without a phalanx of boyhood friends." [...] Even the girls he dated lamented, [...] "Whenever you were with Elvis {{for the most part}} you were with his entourage. Those guys were always around". According to the singer's cousin Billy Smith, Elvis got into bed with Smith and his wife Jo [...] "many times at Graceland when we would spend the night there in Lisa's room, or on tour in the hotel, and at the trailer on the property at Graceland. ... we were all three there talking for hours about everything in the world! Sometimes he would have a bad dream and come looking for me to talk to, and he would actually fall asleep in our bed with us. That happened a lot of times, and we <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> it." ...|$|E

I <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> all the {{wonderful}} places that my goods come from, and wonderful ways that they are made. I {{did not know that}} I was for all practical purposes a king with slaves spearing fishes near the secret pool, and gathering fruits in the islands under the world. My mind was a blank on the thing. I was as mad as a hatter." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{shook his}} head, {{and told him}} very frankly, {{that they were in}} no {{condition}} to undertake anything, for that they were a crew of unresolved, divided rogues; that they were never two days of a mind; that they had nobody to command, and therefore nobody to obey; that several things had been offered, but nothing concluded; that, in short, they <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> but <b>of</b> shifting every one for himself as well as he could.|$|R

60|$|The {{first man}} to try the door was an old Norwegian in a spotted Mackinac jacket and a fur cap, with the {{inevitable}} little red tippet about his neck. He turned the knob, knocked, and at last saw the writing, which he could not read, and went away to tell Johnson that the bank was closed. Johnson <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> special <b>of</b> that; it was early, and they weren't very particular to open on time, anyway.|$|R
