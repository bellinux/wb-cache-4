[...] "We didn’t have [...] people, so after drawing character designs, I was actually doing the dotting (pixelation) for the Nintendo," [...] Inafune stated. [...] "Back then, people weren’t specialized and we had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of different things because there was so few people, so I really ended up doing all the characters." [...] Inafune was influenced by the eponymous protagonist of Osamu Tezuka's manga Astro Boy in his Mega Man designs. Mega Man is colored blue due to the NES console's technical limitations: the color has the most shades in the console's limited 56-color palette, and the expanded selection was used to enhance Mega Man's detail. Although he is often credited for designing the character, Inafune insists that he [...] "only did half of the job in creating him", as his mentor developed the basic character concept before Inafune's arrival. The basic sprites for Roll and Dr. Light were created before Inafune joined the project, and the designs for Cut Man, Ice Man, Fire Man, and Guts Man were in process. Aside from normal enemies, Inafune's first character was Elec Man, inspired by American comic book characters. The artist has commented that Elec Man has always been his favorite design. The designs for Dr. Light and Dr. Wily were based on Santa Claus and Albert Einstein, respectively; the latter character was meant to represent an archetypal [...] "mad scientist".|$|E
