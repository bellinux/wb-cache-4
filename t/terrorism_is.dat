5|$|Piracy Funds Terrorism Volume 1, usually {{referred}} to simply as Piracy Funds <b>Terrorism,</b> <b>is</b> a mixtape produced by British recording artist M.I.A. and American DJ Diplo featuring vocal tracks intended for M.I.A.'s debut album Arular mashed up with samples of other recordings. The mixtape {{was produced by}} the two artists at Diplo's home studio in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was not officially released, but was distributed at M.I.A.'s live shows and via the internet to promote the release of her much-delayed debut album. Despite its unofficial status, the mixtape received general acclaim among critics. Several music publications included the mixtape in their listings of the best albums of 2004.|$|E

25|$|While {{this may}} be true, trying to {{separate}} Haq's actions from {{the larger context of}} the war on <b>terrorism</b> <b>is</b> tunnel vision at its worst.

25|$|Islamic {{terrorism}}, Islamist {{terrorism or}} radical Islamic <b>terrorism</b> <b>is</b> defined as any terrorist act, set of acts or campaign committed by groups or individuals who profess Islamic or Islamist motivations or goals.

25|$|But {{first and}} foremost, <b>terrorism</b> <b>is</b> for us {{a part of}} the {{political}} battle being conducted under the present circumstances, and it has a great part to play: speaking in a clear voice to the whole world, as well as to our wretched brethren outside this land, it proclaims our war against the occupier.|$|E

40|$|Throughout history, as new {{chemical}} threats arose, {{strategies for}} the defense against chemical attacks have also evolved. As a part of an Early Career Laboratory Directed Research and Development project, a systems analysis of past, present, and future chemical <b>terrorism</b> scenarios <b>was</b> performed {{to understand how the}} chemical threats and attack strategies change over time. For the analysis, the difficulty in executing chemical attack was evaluated within a framework of three major scenario elements. First, historical examples of chemical <b>terrorism</b> <b>were</b> examined to determine how the use of chemical threats, versus other weapons, contributed to the successful execution of the attack. Using the same framework, the future of chemical <b>terrorism</b> <b>was</b> assessed with respect to the impact of globalization and new technologies. Finally, the efficacy of the current defenses against contemporary chemical <b>terrorism</b> <b>was</b> considered briefly. The results of this analysis justify the need for continued diligence in chemical defense...|$|R

25|$|<b>Terrorism</b> <b>is</b> after all, a tactic. The term 'war on terrorism' is thus {{effectively}} nonsensical. As {{there is}} no space here to explore this involved and difficult debate, my preference is, on the whole, for the less loaded term 'militancy'. This is not an attempt to condone such actions, merely to analyze them in a clearer way.|$|E

25|$|According {{to recent}} {{government}} statements Islamic <b>terrorism</b> <b>is</b> {{the biggest threat}} to Canada. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) reported that terrorist radicalization at home is now the chief preoccupation of Canada's spy agency. The most notorious arrest in Canada's fight on terrorism, was the 2006 Ontario terrorism plot in which 18 Al-Qaeda-inspired cell members were arrested for planning a mass bombing, shooting, and hostage taking terror plot throughout Southern Ontario. There have also been other arrests mostly in Ontario involving terror plots.|$|E

25|$|The War on <b>Terrorism</b> <b>is</b> {{a global}} {{effort by the}} governments of several {{countries}} (primarily the United States and its principal allies) to neutralize international terrorist groups (primarily Islamic Extremist terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda) and ensure that countries considered by the US {{and some of its}} allies to be Rogue Nations no longer support terrorist activities. It has been adopted primarily {{as a response to the}} September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Since 2001, terrorist motivated attacks upon service members have occurred in Arkansas and Texas.|$|E
25|$|Tomes' is {{an example}} of a {{definition}} that does not cover all insurgencies. For example, the French Revolution had no cell system, and in the American Revolution, little to no attempt was made to terrorize civilians. In consecutive coups in 1977 and 1999 in Pakistan, the initial actions focused internally on the government rather than on seeking broad support. While Tomes' definition fits well with Mao's Phase I, it does not deal well with larger civil wars. Mao does assume <b>terrorism</b> <b>is</b> usually part of the early phases, but it is not always present in revolutionary insurgency.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{the use of}} {{terrorism}} can be an aspect of guerrilla warfare. <b>Terrorism</b> <b>is</b> used to focus international attention on the guerrilla cause, kill opposition leaders, extort money from targets, intimidate the general population, create economic losses, and keep followers and potential defectors in line. As well, the use {{of terrorism}} can provoke the greater power to launch a disproportionate response, thus alienating a civilian population which might be sympathetic to the terrorist's cause. Such tactics may backfire and cause the civil population to withdraw its support, or to back countervailing forces against the guerrillas.|$|E

25|$|Islamic <b>terrorism</b> <b>is,</b> by definition, {{terrorist}} acts committed by Muslim groups or individuals who profess Islamic or Islamist motivations or goals. Islamic terrorists {{have relied on}} particular interpretations of the tenets of the Quran and the Hadith, citing these scriptures to justify violent tactics including mass murder, genocide, child-molestation and slavery. In recent decades, incidents of Islamic terrorism have occurred on a global scale, occurring not only in Muslim-majority states in Africa and Asia, but also abroad in Europe, Russia, and the United States, and such attacks have targeted Muslims and non-Muslims. In {{a number of the}} worst-affected Muslim-majority regions, these terrorists have been met by armed, independent resistance groups, state actors and their proxies, and politically liberal Muslim protesters.|$|E
25|$|Despite of {{politicians}} talks, Israeli public {{does not seem}} to share the same concern about the Iranian nuclear deal. Or rather, they do acknowledge that nuclear capability in Iran is a threat and they {{do not believe that the}} new agreement proposed by Obama will solve the situation. However, in recent polls, when asked to rank what is the major threat to Israeli security, Iran's nuclear power figured only in second position. Hamas and Hezbollah's <b>terrorism</b> <b>is</b> what concerns the most. Also when asked about internal issues, what figured as the highest concern for Israel's stability was the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians, not the Iranian nuclear threat. So, eventhough the population shares with the politicians the same concern about the nuclear threat, they do not think that should be the countrie's first issue to deal with.|$|E
25|$|The USA PATRIOT Act of October 2001 {{dramatically}} reduces {{restrictions on}} law enforcement agencies' ability to search telephone, e-mail communications, medical, financial, and other records; eases restrictions on foreign intelligence gathering within the United States; expands the Secretary of the Treasury's {{authority to regulate}} financial transactions, particularly those involving foreign individuals and entities; and broadens the discretion of law enforcement and immigration authorities in detaining and deporting immigrants suspected of terrorism-related acts. The act also expanded the definition of terrorism to include domestic terrorism, thus enlarging the number of activities to which the USA PATRIOT Act's expanded law enforcement powers could be applied. A new Terrorist Finance Tracking Program monitored the movements of terrorists' financial resources (discontinued after being revealed by The New York Times). Global telecommunication usage, including those with no links to <b>terrorism,</b> <b>is</b> being collected and monitored through the NSA electronic surveillance program.
