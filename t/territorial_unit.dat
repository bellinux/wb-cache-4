40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on the impact of regulation of prostitution on budget income of selected <b>territorial</b> <b>units.</b> The current Proposal of the Act on Regulation of Prostitution and the Act on the Budget Determination of Taxes imply that <b>territorial</b> <b>units</b> should have be entitled especially to a share of the income tax revenue. The estimates of budget income suggest that the mostly affected <b>territorial</b> <b>units</b> should be entitled to the relatively largest share of income tax revenue. However, this rule is violated in case of less affected but large <b>territorial</b> <b>units.</b> This is because, according to the Act on the Budget Determination of Taxes, the income tax revenue is redistributed unproportionally from the most affected <b>territorial</b> <b>units</b> to the largests units. The estimated tax income from regulation of prostitution would be negligible part of the total income of all selected <b>territorial</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R

5|$|There are 42 The Church of England dioceses, each {{being an}} {{administrative}} <b>territorial</b> <b>unit</b> {{governed by a}} bishop. These cover England, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands and {{a small part of}} Wales. The Diocese in Europe is also a part of the Church of England, and covers the whole of continental Europe, Morocco and the post-Soviet states. The structure of dioceses within the Church of England was initially inherited from the Catholic Church as part of the Protestant Reformation. During the Reformation a number of new dioceses were founded, but no more were then created until the middle of the 19th century, when dioceses were founded mainly in response to the growing population, especially in the northern industrial cities. The most recent diocese to be established was the Diocese of Leeds, which came into being on 20 April 2014. Prior to that, no new dioceses had been founded since 1927. Leeds was created by combining three previous dioceses: the Diocese of Bradford, the Diocese of Ripon and Leeds, and the Diocese of Wakefield.|$|E

Although a <b>territorial</b> <b>unit</b> of the same name existed before 1918, the borders proposed by the MKP are significantly different. The proposed region would encompass a long slice of southern Slovakia, with the explicit aim to create an administrative unit with an ethnic-Hungarian majority. Hungarian-minority politicians and intellectuals are convinced that such an administrative unit is essential for the long-term survival of the Hungarian minority. The Slovak government has so far refused to change the boundaries of the administrative units, and ethnic Hungarians continue as minorities in each.|$|E

25|$|The regiment's cap badge is {{a double}} headed Mercian Eagle with Saxon crown. This has been chosen because it forms {{a link to the}} regiment's {{recruiting}} area, which encompass a number of divergent counties that do not have modern traditional links, only under the ancient Kingdom of Mercia (unlike the other new regiments from Scotland, Wales and Yorkshire). It was originally intended to use the old Mercian Brigade badge worn by the Cheshire Regiment, Staffordshire Regiment, Worcestershire Regiment and Sherwood Foresters from 1958 to 1968, rather than create an amalgamated badge that would require elements from all of the antecedents. In 2005, this badge was rejected by the Army Dress Committee {{on the grounds that it}} had been the badge of a <b>territorial</b> <b>unit,</b> The Mercian Volunteers, which was junior to the amalgamating regiments. Accordingly, a slightly modified design featuring two colours of metal was adopted.|$|E
25|$|The corps first {{existed between}} 1928 and 1938 in the North Caucasus as a <b>territorial</b> <b>unit,</b> {{and was a}} Cossack unit {{for the last two}} years of its existence. Reformed in June 1938, the corps fought in the Soviet {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939 and converted into a mechanized corps in the summer of 1940. Reformed in Central Asia in January 1941, the corps served in the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in August of that year, returning to Central Asia in the fall of 1941 to receive three new cavalry divisions. It remained there until September 1942, when it departed for the Stalingrad Front. During Operation Uranus, the Soviet counteroffensive in the Battle of Stalingrad, the 4th Cavalry Corps was intended to act as an exploitation force, but due to being understrength it was surrounded and suffered heavy losses in November and December. Its remnants did not disband until May and June 1943.|$|E
25|$|Samtskhe-Saatabago was {{established}} after {{the expansion of}} the dukedom of Samtskhe. Dukes of Samstkhe were always distinguished by their longing for higher autonomy from the king of Georgia. After the Mongol invasion and their conquest of Georgia, Sargis I Jaqeli and David VII of Georgia rebelled against their Mongol overlords, but failed, and after a myriad of events Samtskhe-Saatabago was designated as a Khasinju, a <b>territorial</b> <b>unit</b> submitting only to the Khan, nominally being a Ulus. Samtskhe-Saatabago managed to remain a culturally developed part of Georgia as well as maintaining territorial integrity, sometimes even expanding along its borders. Samtskhe-Saatabago, which was fully independent at a time, was again incorporated in the Georgian Kingdom by George V of Georgia, who claimed maternal descent from the House of Jaqeli. George V made Samtskhe-Saatabago an integral part of Georgia once again. At the end of the 14th century, Timur's forces invaded Samtskhe-Saatabago several times. After the weakening of Georgian monarchy, the rulers of Samtskhe turned to separatism once more.|$|E

25|$|The 4th and 5th Battalions of the Wiltshire Regiment {{were both}} Territorial Army (TA) units {{called up to}} active duty with {{the start of the}} Second World War. The 4th Battalion, Wilts had been the {{original}} Territorial battalion when the Territorial Army was reorganized during the early 1920s. The 5th Battalion, Wiltshire Regiment was formed on 25 March 1939 as the 2nd Line duplicate of the 4th Battalion as part of the expansion of the Territorials in throughout 1939 when another European conflict seemed increasingly likely. From 1939 to 1944, both units remained in England training, both attached to 129th Infantry Brigade, alongside the 4th Somerset Light Infantry, part of the excellent 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division. Although the 5th Battalion was a 2nd Line <b>Territorial</b> <b>unit,</b> it was assigned to a 1st Line brigade and division. This was because the 43rd Division and its 2nd Line duplicate, the 45th, was not formed as an exact mirror duplicate as most were, but was instead split on a geographical basis, with all the units from Wiltshire, Hampshire and Dorset being assigned to the 43rd, whereas those from Devonshire, Somerset and Cornwall assigned to the 45th.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the First World War the {{regiment}} resumed the practice of alternating postings home and abroad. 1st Battalion was stationed in Ireland, where it captured the Irish republican Seán Moylan, and Germany, which counted as a 'home' posting, and returned to the UK in 1923. Meanwhile, 2nd Battalion was posted to India, with a five-month interlude in Shanghai at short notice from February 1927 when warring Chinese factions threatened the Shanghai International Settlement. In 1928, 2nd Battalion returned to the UK while 1st Battalion served overseas; three years in Egypt, a year in Singapore and six years in India before ending up in Burma in 1938. Prompted by concerns of an Italian invasion following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, 2nd Battalion was sent at short notice to Egypt in January 1936, returning to the UK in January 1937. The following year 5th Battalion became {{the regiment}}'s sole <b>territorial</b> <b>unit</b> when 4th Battalion was converted to 66th Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery (RA), and 6th Battalion to 44th Battalion, Royal Tank Regiment. On the eve of the Second World War the Territorial Army, as the Territorial Force had been renamed, was doubled in size, and 7th Battalion was created in August 1939 as the second-line unit of 5th Battalion.|$|E
25|$|If it ever existed, the Middle Saxon kingdom had {{disappeared}} by the 7th century, and Surrey became a frontier area disputed between the kingdoms of Kent, Essex, Sussex, Wessex and Mercia, until its permanent absorption by Wessex in 825. Despite this fluctuating situation it retained its identity as an enduring <b>territorial</b> <b>unit.</b> During the 7th century Surrey became Christian and initially formed {{part of the}} East Saxon diocese of London, indicating that it was under East Saxon rule at that time, but was later transferred to the West Saxon diocese of Winchester. Its most important religious institution throughout the Anglo-Saxon period and beyond was Chertsey Abbey, founded in 666. At this point Surrey was evidently under Kentish domination, as the abbey was founded under the patronage of King Ecgberht of Kent. However, {{a few years later}} at least part of it was subject to Mercia, since in 673-5 further lands were given to Chertsey Abbey by Frithuwald, a local sub-king (subregulus) ruling under the sovereignty of Wulfhere of Mercia. A decade later Surrey passed into the hands of King Caedwalla of Wessex, who also conquered Kent and Sussex, and founded a monastery at Farnham in 686. The region remained under the control of Caedwalla's successor Ine in the early 8th century. Its political history for most of the 8th century is unclear, although West Saxon control may have broken down around 722, but by 784–5 it had passed into the hands of King Offa of Mercia. Mercian rule continued until 825, when following his victory over the Mercians at the Battle of Ellandun, King Egbert of Wessex seized control of Surrey, along with Sussex, Kent and Essex. It was incorporated into Wessex as a shire and continued thereafter under the rule of the West Saxon kings, who eventually became kings of all of England.|$|E

25|$|The 1st Buckinghamshire Battalion, a <b>Territorial</b> <b>unit</b> of the Ox and Bucks, was {{converted}} to a Beach Group battalion in March 1943 and was to provide the infantry support for the 6th Beach Group. In April 1943 the battalion moved to Scotland to commence training for its new role. The 1st Bucks formed part of the 6th Beach Group landing on Sword Beach on D-Day, 6 June 1944. An anti-tank platoon of 1st Bucks landed on the first tide of the invasion on D-Day, 6 June 1944. The remainder of 1st Bucks landed on the second tide of the invasion on D-Day. German gunners fired at the 1st Bucks from Lebisey wood and from the high ground at Houlgate; there was also much sniping from houses along the beachfront. The 1st Bucks established themselves on Queen Red and Queen White sectors of Sword Beach opposite La Breche on the eastern most landing site of the invasion. The role of the 1st Bucks was to organise the units on the landing beaches and was also deployed to defend the beachhead area from German counter-attacks as troops from the 3rd British Infantry Division moved inland. The 1st Bucks became part of 101 Beach Sub Area of No 6 Beach Group, 3rd Infantry Division and {{took part in the}} defence of Ouistreham in June. Lieutenant Colonel RDR Sale commanded both 1st Bucks and 6th Beach Group and after the Commander of No 5 Beach Group Lieutenant Colonel DHV Board was killed soon after landing, Sale assumed command of both Beach Groups approximately 7,000 men. Sale was awarded the George Medal for his role in limiting the damage caused by a German air attack, on an ammunition dump at La Breche, near Ouistreham, on 8 June. In July companies and platoons of 1st Bucks were transferred to other British divisions, including to the 2nd Ox and Bucks (the 52nd) in the 6th Airborne Division and to the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) and other units in the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, as replacements for the defence of the Normandy bridgehead. The battalion was later reformed but remained, {{for the rest of the}} war, on lines of communication duties. The 1st Bucks was placed into suspended animation in June 1946 and the battalion was finally disbanded on 7 August 1946.|$|E

Malone was placed in command of a new <b>Territorial</b> <b>unit,</b> the 11th Regiment (Taranaki Rifles).

By having his troops push out its crown and indenting its sides, the hat mirrored the outline of Mount Taranaki, thereby providing a link for the regiment to its parent region, and, more practically, allowed rain to easily run off the hat. In later years, the lemon squeezer hat was formally adopted by the New Zealand Military Forces.|$|E
500|$|In 1927, <b>territorial</b> <b>unit</b> titles were {{introduced}} into the Australian Army, and the battalion adopted {{the title of the}} [...] "City of Newcastle Regiment". At the same time, the battalion was afforded the motto Nulli Secundus. In 1929, following the election of the Scullin Labor government, the compulsory training scheme was suspended altogether as it was decided to maintain the part-time military force on a volunteer-only basis. In order to reflect the change, the Citizen Forces was renamed the [...] "Militia" [...] at this time. The end of compulsory training and the fiscal austerity that followed due to the economic downturn of the Great Depression meant that the manpower available to many Militia units at this time was limited and as a result their frontage dropped well below their authorised establishments. Because of this, the decision was eventually made to amalgamate a number of units. Subsequently, the 2nd Battalion was amalgamated with the 41st in 1929, forming the 2nd/41st Battalion, although they were later split in 1933 at which time the 2nd was merged with the 35th, becoming the 2nd/35th Battalion.|$|E
