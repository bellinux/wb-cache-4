40|$|Objective: To {{present the}} nursing actions {{published}} on the errors prevention during <b>the</b> <b>medications</b> administration in <b>the</b> ICU. Method: This is a survey of integrative review, by including papers on nursing actions to reduce errors during <b>the</b> <b>medications</b> administration, published in the period from 2005 to 2011 and indexed in the following databases: LILACS, BDENF and SciELO. Results: we have selected and analyzed 13 papers that met the selection criteria. The discussion was designed from the types of errors. It {{became clear that the}} most cited actions to prevent errors during <b>the</b> <b>medications</b> administration were: to adopt protocols and guidelines for <b>the</b> <b>medications</b> administration; to identify the drug to be administered in the patient through barcodes; and to use incompatible connectors in different routes. Conclusion: the nursing should know the types of errors and adopt actions aimed at reducing errors <b>the</b> <b>medications</b> administration...|$|R

Additionally, nefazodone is documented to have caused clitoral engorgement, as distinct from clitoral priapism, in one case, and clitoral priapism can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E

5000|$|The {{second step}} in the {{treatment}} process is <b>medication.</b> <b>The</b> <b>medications</b> focus on <b>the</b> chemicals released by neurotransmitters in the nervous system, which control muscle movement. <b>The</b> <b>medications</b> on <b>the</b> market today are anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, baclofen, dopaminergic agents/dopamine-depleting agents, and tetrabenazine.

5|$|In {{the second}} stage {{the aim is to}} reduce PD {{symptoms}} while controlling fluctuations in the effect of <b>the</b> <b>medication.</b> Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed. When oral medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery, deep brain stimulation, subcutaneous waking day apomorphine infusion and enteral dopa pumps can be of use. The third stage presents many challenging problems requiring a variety of treatments for psychiatric symptoms, orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction, etc. In the final stages of the disease, palliative care is provided to improve quality of life.|$|E

5|$|Paracetamol {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. Risk factors for toxicity include alcoholism, malnutrition, and the taking of certain other medications. Liver damage results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its metabolites, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI decreases the liver's glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver. Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> was taken. These values are often plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine level of concern.|$|E

5|$|Paracetamol poisoning, {{also known}} as {{acetaminophen}} poisoning, is caused by excessive use of <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> paracetamol (acetaminophen).

This is typically followed {{by a couple of}} days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, and confusion occurs. Additional complications may include kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.
