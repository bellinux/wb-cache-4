Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' Responsa; they had the option <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fifth year to study imperial constitutions.

He and Cartmel remained on the production team for the twenty-sixth season in 1989.

At the end of the year, Cartmel was head-hunted to script-edit the BBC's popular medical drama, Casualty, and Nathan-Turner also finally left the show, although no replacements were assigned for either position as in-house production was being shut down.|$|E

While crossing {{one of the many}} rivers of the Llanos, a horserider of the expedition, Jorge Olmeda, drowned with his horse and an indigenous woman he had taken with him. The Spanish honoured him by naming this the Olmeda River. The soldiers reached La Fragua, a settlement populated by the Choque in the present-day department of Caquetá, where Hernán Pérez de Quesada decided <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while to rest.

Maldonado tried to cross a river but he was halted by the indigenous people living there, who shot poisoned arrows at the conquistador, forcing him to retreat. At night, Baltasar Maldonado and his men attempted to defeat the indigenous a second time, this time successfully by ambushing them on a small island in the river. The hurt natives fled and many drowned in the waters. Hernán Pérez de Quesada with the other remaining soldiers joined the troops of Maldonado again in Mocoa, Putumayo to the south. From here, the expedition went back into the Andes to search for food.|$|E
