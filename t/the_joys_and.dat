In Bloomberg News, the critics commented that the playwrights were [...] "literary alchemists expert at mixing the sentimental and the satirical and turning out something poignant" [...] and noted that the clothing and accessories dominated the memories while [...] "The men are extras." [...] The Los Angeles Times described the show as a cross between The Vagina Monologues and What Not to Wear. Helen Shaw, writing for Time Out, also described the Ephrons' style as similar to The Vagina Monologuess' Eve Ensler. [...] Jay Reiner of The Hollywood Reporter also notes that from the work [...] "a tapestry of the collective female psyche emerges that is tender and insightful without being sentimental".

500|$|A Ladies' Aid {{society was}} {{established}} on July15, 1903, with board members Marie Hovgaard, Anna P.C. Petersen, Henrietta Hansen, and Sine C. Jensen. At first, Sunday school was conducted an hour {{prior to the}} church services on Sunday, but in 1907 {{it was decided to}} hold Sunday school during the time of worship service. As early as 1904, the synod had discussed the possibility of establishing a children's home at Tyler. On November1, 1906, a children's home opened in the residence of K.H. Duus, who temporarily moved to Askov, Minnesota. A Folk School Association was organized in 1912. As early as 1888, the colony organized its first Danish elementary school for its children, Børneskolen, which was in use until 1939. In her travel diary entitled My Big Adventure of 1915–1916: <b>The</b> <b>joys</b> <b>and</b> hazards of motor touring in 1915, Danebod local Ragna C. Olson (1905–2007) described the average school day in 1914: [...] "We had an hour of religion, then learned how to read and write Danish, some history, and the last hour we girls learned work such as knitting, crocheting and embroidery. In the afternoons, they taught us English, writing, reading and arithmetic." [...] Ragna Olsen (previously Sorensen) was the daughter of the Danish pioneers Johanne Marie Sorensen (1877–1947) and Carl Cold Sorensen (1879–1967), both of whom hold a place in Danebod history for bringing the first motorized vehicles to Tyler in the early 1900s.|$|E

2500|$|Affective piety is most {{commonly}} {{described as a}} style of highly emotional devotion to the humanity of Jesus, particularly in his infancy and his death, and to <b>the</b> <b>joys</b> <b>and</b> sorrows of the Virgin Mary. It was {{a major influence on}} many varieties of devotional literature in late-medieval Europe, both in Latin and in the vernaculars.: This practice of prayer, reading, and meditation was often cultivated through concentration on vivid images of scenes from the Bible, Saints' Lives, and other religious material. These images could be either conjured up in people's minds when they read or heard poetry and other pieces of religious literature, or they could gaze on manuscript illuminations and other pieces of art as they prayed and meditated on the scenes depicted. [...] In either case, this style of affective meditation asked the [...] "viewer" [...] to engage with the scene as if she or he were physically present and to stir up feelings of love, fear, grief, and/or repentance for sin.|$|E
2500|$|Davis' {{favorite}} {{topic was}} the world of child-life. She had nearly completed a work which was afterward published under the title of Clinton Forest; or, The Harvest of Love. It treats of child-life, home influence, school scenes, the power of kindness {{in the treatment of}} children, the wanderings and trials of the child, <b>the</b> <b>joys</b> <b>and</b> sorrows of life. She did not dare to publish it, or hardly show it to her friends to get their opinion of it. In due time, she completed another manuscript, Marion Lester; or, The Mother's Mistake. The mistake of the mother consisted in sending her daughter to the school where religious error required a severe form of discipline. The plot was entirely Davis'. Some of the characters were taken from real life and some were drawn from the imagination. She prepared it for the press, and in May, 1856, sent it forth. It was a success. The book was read with intense interest by thousands.|$|E
