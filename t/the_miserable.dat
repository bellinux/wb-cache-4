5|$|In 1931 Berni {{returned}} to Rosario where he briefly {{lived on a}} farm and was then hired as a municipal employee. The Argentina of the 1930s {{was very different from}} the Paris of the 1920s. He witnessed labor demonstrations and <b>the</b> <b>miserable</b> effects of unemployment and was shocked by the news of a military coup d'état in Buenos Aires (see Infamous Decade). Surrealism didn't convey the frustration or hopelessness of the Argentine people. Berni organized Mutualidad de Estudiantes y Artistas and {{became a member of the}} local Communist party.|$|E
5|$|Kalyani {{is nearly}} molested by a {{vagabond}} named Venu, but is saved by Gunasekaran. She later leaves Madurai and arrives at Tiruchi, where she obtains {{work as a}} maid of blackmarketeer Narayana Pillai, who also tries to molest her. She is, however, saved by his wife, and leaves the job. While searching for his sister, Gunasekaran reaches Tiruchi and comes across Vimala, a wealthy woman, to whom he explains <b>the</b> <b>miserable</b> status {{of him and his}} sister in the society. After resting in her house for a while, he silently leaves to continue searching for Kalyani.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} sector continued to perform poorly and by Brezhnev's final year, food shortages were reaching disturbing levels of frequency. Particularly embarrassing {{to the regime}} {{was the fact that}} even bread had become rationed, one commodity that they always prided themselves on being available. One reason for this was excessive consumer demand as food prices remained artificially low while incomes had trebled over the last 20 years. Despite <b>the</b> <b>miserable</b> failure of collective farming, the Soviet government remained committed to reducing imports of foodstuffs from the West even though they cost less than domestic production, not only for reasons of national pride, but out of fear of becoming dependent on capitalist countries for basic necessities.|$|E

5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>miserable</b> Wretch hath {{worn out}} the Charity of his Friends, and {{consumed}} the Money, which he hath raised upon his Cloaths, and Bedding, and hath eat his last Allowance of Provisions, he {{usually in a}} few Days grows weak, for want of Food, with the symptoms of a hectick Fever; and when {{he is no longer}} able to stand, if he can raise 3d to pay the Fee of the common Nurse of the Prison, he obtains the Liberty of being carried into the Sick Ward, and lingers on for about a Month or two, by the assistance of the above-mentioned Prison Portion of Provision, and then dies.|$|E
5|$|Although written {{during the}} Twelfth dynasty, Ipuwer only survives from a Nineteenth dynasty papyrus. However, A {{man and his}} Ba is found on an {{original}} Twelfth dynasty papyrus, Papyrus Berlin 3024. These two texts resemble other discourses in style, tone, and subject matter, although they are unique in that the fictional audiences are given very active roles in the exchange of dialogue. In Ipuwer, a sage addresses an unnamed king and his attendants, describing <b>the</b> <b>miserable</b> state of the land, which he blames on the king's inability to uphold royal virtues. This can be seen either {{as a warning to}} kings or as a legitimization of the current dynasty, contrasting it with the supposedly turbulent period that preceded it. In A man and his Ba, a man recounts for an audience a conversation with his ba (a component of the Egyptian soul) on whether to continue living in despair or to seek death as an escape from misery.|$|E
5|$|The leading {{infantry}} brigade of 52nd (Lowland) Division, {{which had}} reached Beit Likia on 19 November by moving along a track {{north of the}} main road, was held up towards Kuryet el Enab by a very determined and formidable Ottoman rearguard armed with machine guns at Kustal and Beit Dukka. The Ottoman positions were strongly defended and the 52nd (Lowland) Division could not advance until a mist, rolled down just before dark on 21 November, giving the 75th Division the opportunity to rapidly deploy, climb the ridge, and defeat the Ottoman force with bayonets. That night, the troops ate their iron rations (carried by the men as emergency rations), and some found shelter from <b>the</b> <b>miserable</b> conditions in a large monastery and sanatorium. The night was cold with heavy rain, and those without shelter suffered severely. No supplies arrived till noon the following day owing to congestion on the narrow tracks.|$|E

25|$|Many historians {{consider}} that this epidemic {{was one of}} the main causes of the extinction of the negro race in Buenos Aires, as it raged through the coloured people, because they mostly lived in <b>the</b> <b>miserable</b> conditions in the south of the city.|$|E

25|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>the</b> <b>miserable</b> life conditions {{in a great}} part of South America reflected on his writings that were insistently turning into complaining journalism. His turn to a definitively anarchic not only carried problems with the more upper classes and the Paraguayan government (being imprisoned many times), but also many Paraguayan intellectuals gave him the back.|$|E
25|$|O most merciful God, Who, for the {{salvation}} of sinners and the refuge of <b>the</b> <b>miserable,</b> wast pleased that the Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary should be most like in charity and pity to the Divine Heart of Thy Son Jesus Christ; grant that we, who commemorate this most sweet and loving Heart, may by the merits and intercession of the same Blessed Virgin merit to be found according to the Heart of Jesus.

25|$|Mrs Betty Higden – a child-minder, {{who takes}} in poor {{children}} and cares for them, including Johnny, the orphan whom the Boffins plan to adopt before he dies in the children's hospital. She is old and poor, and portrayed sympathetically as pitiable. She is so terrified of {{dying in the}} workhouse that, when she begins to grow sick, she runs away {{to the country and}} ends up dying in Lizzie Hexam's arms. Mrs Higden draws readers' attention to <b>the</b> <b>miserable</b> lives led by the poor, and the need for social reform.|$|E

50|$|He pursued {{an active}} {{theatrical}} life, despite his father’s opposition, writing plays and performing on the stage. Given {{the poverty of}} his family, the financial advantage that acting afforded him {{may well have been}} a factor in defying his father’s wishes. He quickly gained recognition and sustained popularity through his plays. Some of his theatrical works include Black Lands(1868), Artashes the Conqueror (1869), Fall of the House of the Arsacids (1870), Capture of Ani, the Capital of Armenia (1871), and Theatre or <b>the</b> <b>Miserables</b> (1871). Theatre or <b>The</b> <b>Miserables</b> takes on <b>the</b> issue of social injustice and moral decay. In the play two lovers commit suicide on stage. Had Tourian lived a longer life, he might have had opportunity to develop a more sophisticated theatrical repertoire. History remembers him more for his verse than his dramas, although the latter initially brought him fame during his lifetime.|$|R

And there in the place, where there is constant shivering, they resort to a large burning fire; but they find no relief in that place of torture; the tormentors torture them still. There is heard everywhere the noise of painfully uttered cries even as in the street of a town. Those whose bad Karman takes effect (viz. the punishers), violently torment again and again those whose bad Karman takes effect also (viz. the punished).|$|E
25|$|His family {{joined him}} in 1863, and {{thereafter}} they {{shifted to the}} much cheaper Versailles, due to <b>the</b> <b>miserable</b> state of their finances. Funds were not arriving from India according to his plans. He was only able to relocate to England in 1865 and study for the bar due to the munificent generosity of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar. For this, Dutt was to regard Vidyasagar as Dayar Sagar (meaning the ocean of kindness) {{for as long as}} he lived. He was admitted to the High Court in Calcutta on his return in February 1867. His family followed him in 1869.|$|E
25|$|Love and sensuality {{fill the}} {{subsequent}} days at Donnafugata. The Count dreamily, and ineffectually, pursues Concetta, while Concetta's younger sisters (Carolina and Caterina) dream romantically of Tancredi and the Count, and Tancredi and Angelica {{spend their time}} exploring the palace's many rooms, each of which contains some representation of a leopard, the family insignia. Narration describes how, on several occasions, Tancredi and Angelica are tempted {{to give in to}} their mutual sensual desire, but never do... and how this idyllic time of romantic, intimate gaming between them was a happy prelude to <b>the</b> <b>miserable,</b> unsuccessful marriage that followed.|$|E

25|$|In the south, the IDF {{carried out}} several offensives, {{including}} Operation An-Far and Operation Death to the Invader. The {{task of the}} 11th Brigades's 1st Battalian on the southern flank was to capture villages, and its operation ran smoothly, with but little resistance from local irregulars. According to Amnon Neumann, a Palmach veteran of the Southern front, hardly any Arab villages in the south fought back, due to <b>the</b> <b>miserable</b> poverty of their means and lack of weapons, and suffered expulsion. What slight resistance was offered was quelled by an artillery barrage, followed by the storming of the village, whose residents were expelled and houses destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The social {{conscience}} that {{was raised in}} the early 19th century helped to elevate the awareness of mental illness and its treatment. A leading advocate of reform for mental illness was Dorothea Dix, a Massachusetts woman who made an intensive study of the conditions that the mentally ill were kept in. Dix's report to the Massachusetts state legislature along with the development of the Kirkbride Plan helped to alleviate <b>the</b> <b>miserable</b> conditions for many of the mentally ill. Although these facilities often fell short of their intended purpose, reformers continued to follow Dix's advocacy and call for increased study and treatment of mental illness.|$|E
25|$|This {{book was}} {{conceived}} in March {{of the year}} 1929 , {{during the course of}} a stay in Damascus. <b>The</b> <b>miserable</b> sight of maimed and famished-looking refugee children, working in a carpet factory, gave me the final impulse to snatch the incomprehensible destiny of the Armenian people from the Hell of all that had taken place. The writing of the book followed between July 1932 and March 1933. Meanwhile, in November, on a lecture tour through German cities, the author selected Chapter 5 of Book One for public readings. It was read in its present form, based on the historic records of a conversation between Enver Pasha and Pastor Johannes Lepsius.|$|E
