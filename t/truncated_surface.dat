The SPA-LEED patterns reveal more than 500 individual diffraction spots in the k-vector range of |k∥| < 3 Å- 1. The positions of all observed diffraction spots agree with the surface projections of the reciprocal lattice structure of the type-I bulk phase. HAS shows identical spot positions as SPA-LEED, thus demonstrating a top surface layer with long range quasicrystalline order and a reciprocal lattice structure consistent with that of a bulk <b>truncated</b> <b>surface.</b> SPA-LEED peak widths are found to vary between different diffraction orders. Based on an analysis of a randomized Fibonacci sequence, this is linked to the random nature of the tiling of the type-I structure. STM measurements reveal a surface morphology characterized by rough single-height steps separating terraces with widths on the order of 100 Å. Two different surface terminations are observed, a coarse and a fine one, frequently coexisting on single terraces. The fine structure termination directly reflects the atomic structure of a bulk <b>truncated</b> <b>surface,</b> allowing a random rhombic tiling to be identified. In order to compare diffraction, real-space data, and atomic structure models, the Patterson function and autocorrelation of the surface structure, respectively, are studied. This allows an understanding of the coarse structure termination as consisting of subunits of a few atoms each arranged statistically on sites defined by the atomic tiling of the bulk tenfold planes. ...|$|E

Such cells proliferate rapidly within bursal epithelial buds of normal morphology. In addition, despite reduced levels of endogenous light chain rearrangement, those light chain rearrangements that have occurred have undergone variable region diversification by gene conversion.

40|$|AbstractThe crossed {{compound}} parabolic concentrator (CCPC) is one of {{the most}} efficient non-imaging solar concentrators used as a stationary solar concentrator or as a second stage solar concentrator. In this study, the CCPC is modified to demonstrate for the first time a new generation of solar concentrators working simultaneously as an electricity generator and thermal collector. The CCPC is designed to have two complementary surfaces, one reflective and one absorptive, and is named as an absorptive/reflective CCPC (AR-CCPC). Usually, the height of the CCPC is truncated with a minor sacrifice of the geometric concentration. These <b>truncated</b> <b>surfaces</b> rather than being eliminated are instead replaced with absorbent surfaces to collect heat from solar radiation. The optical efficiency including absorptive/reflective part of the AR-CCPC was simulated and compared for different geometric concentration ratios varying from 3. 6 × to 4 ×. It was found that the combined optical efficiency of the AR-CCPC 3. 6 ×/ 4 × remained constant and high all day long and that it had the highest total optical efficiency compared to other concentrators. In addition, the temperature distributions of AR-CCPC surfaces and the assembled solar cell were simulated based on those heat flux boundary conditions. It was shown that the addition of a thermal absorbent surface can increase the wall temperature. The maximum value reached 321. 5 K at the front wall under 50 ° incidence. The experimental verification was also adopted to show the benefits of using absorbent surfaces.

At early times, the truncated inviscid SQG simulations show a behavior reminiscent of forced-dissipative SQG turbulence, and we identify spectral scaling laws for the energy and enstrophy spectra.

The property of the spiral twist with variable pitch (as helical trajectory on a double <b>truncated</b> <b>surface)</b> is that its axial pitch is proportional to the variable diameter of the wood part on which it is processed, so to create the maximum aesthetic effect of the proportion between the volumes and the dynamism required by the ornament function of the piece of furniture.

The proportion between the pitch measured on the part surface and the corresponding diameter has to comply with the proportion between the axial pitch and the corresponding diameter. The axial pitch cannot be measured, but it can be calculated depending on the pitch measured on the part’s surface.

We reprocessed seismic reflection lines, did new facies analyses and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr dating of carbonate samples from the carbonate platforms. A 50 km long narrow paleoisland flanking the Vema transform, underwent subsidence, erosion, and truncation at sea level; it was then capped by a 500 m thick carbonate platform dated by 87 Sr/ 86 Sr at ∼ 11 – 10 Ma.
