Such writings have no parallels in any previous Tamil literature. The war produced displaced Tamil writers around the globe who recorded their longing for <b>their</b> <b>lost</b> homes and the need for integration with mainstream communities in Europe and North America.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{now hold}} {{that there was}} likely no {{cross-pollination}} between the Revolt of the Lash and these subsequent revolts. The formerly mutinous Minas Geraes, {{under the command of}} João Cândido after the officers abandoned the ship, used a hidden-away gun (as the ship had otherwise been disarmed after the Revolt of the Lash) to fire on the marine infantry and demonstrate their loyalty. Even so, the government and navy, fueled by anger over <b>their</b> <b>lost</b> honor, used this opportunity to round up the remaining amnestied sailors and put them in prison.|$|E
5|$|In From Dust, players {{assume a}} god-like, first-person {{perspective}} {{from which they}} manipulate an archipelago environment {{in an effort to}} save and enlighten a nomadic tribe and help them to seek <b>their</b> <b>lost</b> knowledge. With a spherical cursor, the user controls certain types of matter in real time. Lava cools to form solid rock, vegetation propagates in soil and spreads naturally once a village is built, and moving water quickly erodes the terrain. Physical changes to the world occur extremely rapidly, allowing players to restructure islands within minutes.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Black Christians have {{identified}} themselves spiritually with the Children of Israel. In the late 19th century, {{some of them}} also began to claim {{that they were the}} biological descendants of the Israelites. This identification with the Israelites was a response to the sociopolitical realities of their situation in the United States, including slavery and racial discrimination. For African-Americans, appropriating Jewish history was part of a rebellion against the American racial hierarchy that deemed Africans inferior. It was also a means of fulfilling their desire to know their origins and regain <b>their</b> <b>lost</b> history.|$|E
5|$|After his acclamation, Maximian was {{dispatched}} {{to fight the}} rebel Bagaudae, insurgent peasants of Gaul. Diocletian returned to the East, progressing slowly. By 2 November, he had only reached Civitas Iovia (Botivo, near Ptuj, Slovenia). In the Balkans during the autumn of 285, he encountered a tribe of Sarmatians who demanded assistance. The Sarmatians requested that Diocletian either help them recover <b>their</b> <b>lost</b> lands or grant them pasturage rights within the empire. Diocletian refused and fought a battle with them, {{but was unable to}} secure a complete victory. The nomadic pressures of the European Plain remained and could not be solved by a single war; soon the Sarmatians would have to be fought again.|$|E
5|$|British losses {{during the}} siege of 88 killed and 131 wounded were {{relatively}} heavy; French casualties were not recorded but {{were thought to be}} negligible as few defenders were exposed to British fire during the only day of bombardment. Captured in the city were 645 French soldiers and 1,014 sepoys with 167 guns of varying sizes and materials and substantial quantities of ammunition. Elsewhere the other French Indian colonies of Karaikal, Yanam, Mahé and Chandernagore all surrendered when summoned without conflict, assuring British dominance among the European powers on the Indian Subcontinent. It has been noted that British naval forces in the Bay of Bengal were unusually weak during this period, Minerva the only warship on active operations, and had the French managed to concentrate their forces in the region they might have considerably extended the siege of Pondicherry and caused considerable damage to British merchant shipping in the region. The French made no efforts to recapture <b>their</b> <b>lost</b> Indian territories during the war, but regained them {{under the terms of the}} Peace of Amiens in 1802.|$|E

5|$|From Dust {{is a god}} video game, {{designed}} by Éric Chahi and developed by Ubisoft Montpellier. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Arcade in 2011. Described as a spiritual successor to Populous, the game revolves around The Breath, which was summoned by a tribe to help them seek and recover <b>their</b> <b>lost</b> knowledge. In the game, players, controlling a cursor, can manipulate matter such as lava, soil, and water. Players can help the tribespeople to overcome challenges including finding different totems and overcoming natural disasters. In addition to the story mode, the game features a Challenge mode which offers a shorter, but harder experience.|$|E
5|$|In April 2004, Farmer {{announced}} {{the formation of}} a committee to study the effectiveness of state owned and operated farmer's markets. In June 2005, he was elected secretary of the Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture; in 2007, he was elected president of the organization. Farmer also sought to prevent an outbreak of vesicular stomatitis virus in the state's horses and cattle by banning the import of animals from 20 western counties where the virus was known to have infected animals. On Farmer's advice, Governor Ernie Fletcher requested that the United States Department of Agriculture designate Kentucky as an agricultural disaster area after an April 2007 cold snap devastated the state's fruit and wheat crops; the designation made Kentucky farmers eligible for low-interest federal loans to help compensate for <b>their</b> <b>lost</b> crop revenue.|$|E
5|$|In the 1928 provincial election, the Liberals regained some of <b>their</b> <b>lost</b> {{popularity}} {{in one of}} the closest votes in Nova Scotia history. The Conservatives remained in power with 23 seats to the Liberals' 20. Economic conditions worsened after the stock market crash of 1929 making it seem increasingly likely that the Liberals would return to power in the next election. Macdonald helped draft a 15-point party platform for approval at a Liberal convention in the fall of 1930. It promised an eight-hour working day and free elementary school textbooks. It also pledged to establish a formal inquiry into Nova Scotia's economic prospects and the province's place within Confederation.|$|E

La Salle decided to stay and search for the missing member. La Salle had a stockade built and named it Fort Prudhomme, after <b>their</b> <b>lost</b> man. This was the first structure built by the French in Tennessee. Days later, the missing member found his way back. Prudhomme had lost his way while hunting.

5|$|The {{situation}} changed {{again on}} 10February 1306, when Robert the Bruce murdered his rival John Comyn {{and a few}} weeks later, on 25March, had himself crowned King of Scotland by Isobel, sister of the Earl of Buchan. Bruce now embarked on a campaign to restore Scottish independence, and this campaign took the English by surprise. Edward was suffering ill health by this time, and instead of leading an expedition himself, he gave different military commands to Aymer de Valence and Henry Percy, while the main royal army was led by the Prince of Wales. The English initially met with success; on 19June, Aymer de Valence routed Bruce at the Battle of Methven. Bruce was forced into hiding, while the English forces recaptured <b>their</b> <b>lost</b> territory and castles.|$|E

5|$|The {{two works}} are bound {{together}} in one surviving manuscript, the earliest surviving cartulary from medieval England. A major theme is the losses suffered by Worcester {{at the hands of}} royal officials and local landowners. Included amongst the despoilers are kings such as Cnut and William the Conqueror, and nobles such as Eadric Streona and Urse d'Abetot. Also included are accounts of lawsuits waged by the Worcester monks in an effort to regain <b>their</b> <b>lost</b> lands. The two sections of the cartulary were first printed in 1723. The original manuscript was slightly damaged by fire in 1733, and required rebinding. A new printed edition is in production as of 2010.|$|E
5|$|UK {{department}} store retailer Debenhams' collaboration with designers, launched in 1993 under their Designers at Debenhams range, was a success. Hoping to recapture some of <b>their</b> <b>lost</b> market share, Marks and Spencer (M) asked Everest to review their menswear range. As Creative Consultant, he designed the Sartorial suiting line for their menswear collection. In October 2000, he designed the Autograph suiting line. Noting that the M range consisted of Italian-style suiting, he aimed {{to achieve a}} more 'British' look from the cut, fit and styling and by using different fabrics and colours. He also has responsibility for their Luxury collection. During M advertising campaigns, his designs for the Autograph range have been modelled by several British celebrities, including David Beckham, Bryan Ferry, Jimmy Carr, Martin Freeman, Bob Mortimer and Take That. In 2007, M were selected by The Football Association as 'Official Tailor to the England football team' and Everest designed the team's official suits for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.|$|E

The Organization's plan is also revealed: they seek to regain <b>their</b> <b>lost</b> hearts by creating {{their own version of}} Kingdom Hearts from the sum of all the hearts released from the Heartless slain by Sora's Keyblade. The three arrive at the headquarters of Organization XIII and team up with their friends. Ansem the Wise uses a device that dissipates some of Kingdom Hearts' power, but it self-destructs, engulfing Ansem. At the top of the Castle that Never Was, Sora and his friends battle Xemnas. After Sora and Riku defeat Xemnas, they get trapped in the realm of darkness, but a letter from Kairi summons a gateway for them, and the two are reunited with their friends at their home.|$|E
