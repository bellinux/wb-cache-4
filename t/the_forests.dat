5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>forests,</b> {{endangered}} birds {{such as the}} yellowhead (mohua) and kakariki (New Zealand parakeet) occur, as {{do other}} birds such as the tui, fantail (piwakawaka), and kererū (New Zealand pigeon). One of New Zealand's only two native species of non-marine mammal, the long-tailed bat, lives in small numbers within <b>the</b> <b>forests,</b> and several species of lizard are also found locally, including the southern forest gecko.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>forests</b> {{were also}} the home of notorious {{criminal}} and bandit Veerapan, who made a living poaching ivory and sandalwood from <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> and selling them on the black market. Veerapan was killed by the Tamil Nadu Police in October 2004.|$|E
50|$|The {{topography}} generally slopes {{toward the}} south with four major topographical features dominating <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> Sun Mountain {{in the northeast}} corner of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> and Sand Ridge on <b>the</b> <b>forest’s</b> northern border are highly visible features. The eastern part of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> is dominated by a large pumice plain while lava flows are the main feature in the northwest. In addition, two year-around creeks shape the character of <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> Sun Creek runs through the center of <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> and over time, has cut a small canyon through <b>the</b> <b>forest’s</b> central plains. Annie Creek runs along the western border of <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> and is flanked by meadow lands.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>forest</b> {{consists}} predominantly of towering Mountain {{blue gum}} (Eucalyptus deanei) trees, with an understory of shrubs. <b>The</b> <b>forest</b> {{can be accessed}} only on foot, with several trails {{from different parts of}} the Grose Valley and adjacent canyons meeting in <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> <b>The</b> most direct route into <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> from Blackheath is by the Perrys Lookdown track, which descends 656 m to <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> <b>The</b> return walk uphill is rated as [...] "hard".|$|R
5|$|Concentrated near water bodies, the {{vegetation}} {{in most of}} El Hatillo is dense forests, occupying around 30% of the surface. Smaller plants like shrubs take around 9% and herbs occupy a similar percentage. In 1972, <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> of El Hatillo were declared a protected zone of the metropolitan area of Caracas.|$|E
5|$|Excavation has {{revealed}} remnants of oak, {{some of it}} from trees hundreds of years old. It is likely that this came from various sources; some from nearby, and some donated from <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> at Delamere and Macclesfield. The church and monastic buildings were constructed in Romanesque style.|$|E
5|$|Forests make {{up about}} , or 48 percent, of the province's land area. <b>The</b> <b>forests</b> consist of pines (Jack Pine, Red Pine, Eastern White Pine), spruces (White Spruce, Black Spruce), Balsam Fir, Tamarack (larch), poplars (Trembling Aspen, Balsam Poplar), birches (White Birch, Swamp Birch) and small pockets of Eastern White Cedar.|$|E

Thranduil claimed the {{northern}} regions of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> as far south as the mountains in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> (<b>the</b> Emyn Duir), and Celeborn took the southern part of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> below <b>the</b> Narrows, calling it East Lórien.|$|R
50|$|Tourists mostly {{go to see}} <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> in monsoon. One {{needs to}} take {{permission}} from <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> office to visit <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> A local boat needs to be hired to travel through <b>the</b> swamp <b>forest.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Forest</b> of Laye is a {{relic of}} <b>the</b> ancient <b>Forest</b> of Yveline. Very early it became a royal domain and hunting grounds of the Kings of France who resided at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Henry IV and Louis XIII of France often used <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> for fox hunting. Louis XIV also walked <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> and hired an architect, André Le Nôtre, to build a terrace {{bordering}} <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> dominating <b>the</b> valley of the River Seine in 1663. He also built a high wall, finished by Napoléon, encircling <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> to prevent game from escaping the woods. After the abandonment of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> of Saint-Germain in 1682 by Louis XIV, Charles X resumed the hunting tradition of Saint-Germain. Napoléon III purchased land to the South to link <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> of Saint-Germain with <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> of Marly. <b>The</b> arrival of the railway in 1835, then {{the development of the}} car, considerably increased use of <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Pallittorre's {{numbers have}} been {{estimated}} from as low as 50–60 to as high as 600. They maintained cleared grassy plains by regular careful burning, and used this method also to control undergrowth in <b>the</b> <b>forests.</b> This land management technique enabled easier hunting and food gathering. European colonists noted, after the Pallittorre had been eliminated from the area, how <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> rapidly reclaimed the formerly cleared land. They ranged across the land on a seasonal basis, {{at least as far}} as Mole Creek, and lived in villages of bark huts at times. They mined ochre in the Gog Range, trading this with other aborigines, across Tasmania. The Pallitorre congregated in areas in the Meander area, such as Jackeys Marsh - the name 'jackey' being a colloquial term for aboriginal people.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>forest</b> {{was created}} in 1908 by {{proclamation}} of President Theodore Roosevelt. <b>The</b> <b>forest</b> is home to over 500 species of trees and woody plants.

30|$|Research on <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> {{dynamics}} of native araucarian forests is still incipient, mainly {{because most of}} <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> fragments are poorly structured. To {{gain a better understanding}} of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> dynamics, growth models have been developed to evaluate the structure and composition of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> over time. These powerful tools can be used to explore how <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> will change in response to adversity and stand conditions (Newton 2007).|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>forests</b> and meadows of Bryce Canyon {{provide the}} habitat to support diverse animal life {{including}} foxes, badgers, porcupines, elk, black bears, bobcats, and woodpeckers. Mule deer {{are the most}} common large mammals in the park. Elk and pronghorn, which have been reintroduced nearby, sometimes venture into the park.|$|E

5|$|The {{native forest}} in the Canberra region was almost wholly {{eucalypt}} species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials {{of a number of}} species including Pinus radiata on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> are also popular recreation areas.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>forest</b> {{now has a}} small {{population}} of 29 families with 206 members (2003). The {{population of}} <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> are concentrated into three small villages. Residents engage in primitive agriculture, primarily {{for the production of}} manioc flour. Fishing and hunting are also important sources of food. Brazil nuts and açaí are also exported from <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> <b>The</b> current population of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> may not cause damage to <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> as they carry on practices of the prehistoric population of <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> Research on <b>the</b> local population and its effect on the ecology of Caxiuanã, however, is lacking.|$|R

50|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> {{experiences}} a Highland climate with warm summers and cold winters. Even in the summer, nights are cool due to <b>the</b> <b>forest's</b> high elevation.

5|$|An ephemeral natural pool {{system is}} located in the {{vicinity}} of Scotch Run. In the past, a reservoir was created on the stream by damming it.
