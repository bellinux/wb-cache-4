It was unveiled by King Carl XVI Gustaf, at a ceremony attended by then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and his wife Nane Maria Annan, Wallenberg's niece. At the unveiling, King Carl XVI Gustaf said Wallenberg is [...] "a great example {{to those of us}} who want to live as fellow humans". Kofi Annan praised him as [...] "an inspiration for all of us to act when we can and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to help those who are suffering and in need of help".

500|$|Speculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan {{returned}} to the show {{for a second time}} in its fifth season. Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T.R. Knight were set to depart from the show, but he later retracted his comment. During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's one-hundredth episode wrap party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as no one on the production team would disclose her character's fate to her. It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season. Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice. Although she was scheduled to appear in the final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010. Heigl explained that she wanted {{to spend more time with}} her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again. Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with io9 on 28 July 2009, creator Russell T Davies {{was asked about the}} controversy surrounding Ianto's death and the fan reaction campaign. He replied [...] "There's a campaign, because he was a coffee boy. But {{do you know how many}} packets of coffee they've received so far? Nine. So I think people writing online might sound like thousands of people, but they are nine." [...] However, those involved in the movement believe that this number is much higher due to a post tallying the coffee sent within the community. When asked about the backlash in a separate interview with Michael Ausiello, Russell T Davies said [...] "It's not particularly a backlash. What's actually happening is, well, nothing really to be honest. It's a few people posting online and getting fans upset". He also stated that the character was gone for good, and that his resurrection would devalue the [...] "entire plot." [...] He recommended that fans who wish to stop watching the show should watch Supernatural [...] "because those boys are beautiful", or [...] "look at poetry" [...] if they [...] "can't handle drama". Following these statements, the Save Ianto Jones website encouraged fans to contact BBC Wales rather than Davies, and temporarily presented on its front page the message [...] "Mr Davies has made it clear in recent interviews that he views his fans with contempt, and as disposable, which saddens us" [...] and asked not to be [...] "abused". At Comic-Con 2009, a fan claimed that Davies [...] "hurt" [...] a lot of internet fans with his decision to kill Ianto, which she called [...] "out of line." [...] Davies replied that he would not change his mind regarding the decision, adding, [...] "I've got to be blunt about this, there have been campaigns to send packets of coffee to BBC Wales in protest. There have been nine packets sent. I'm not taking the mickey, but that's a very small number." [...] Executive producer Julie Gardner stated [...] "We want people to be engaged, discuss and not always agree with us. At the end of the day, I make drama to support each author's vision. It's not a democracy. Whether people like it or not, it's storytelling." [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek has criticised the Internet campaigns to resurrect the character, citing that the show would [...] "lose far more credibility" [...] if he were brought back. Brew also expressed doubt that the fans stating they would boycott a fourth series will do so. He summarised: [...] "Torchwood now needs to continue <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> of its convictions, and for that to happen, the reset switch simply isn't an option." ...|$|E

40|$|Aim This paper {{presents}} {{a study that}} explores how newly qualified registered nurses experience their leadership role in the ward-based nursing care team. Background A nurse's clinical leadership affects {{the quality of care}} provided. Newly qualified nurses experience difficulties during the transition period from student to qualified professional and find it challenging to lead nursing care. Methods Twelve nurses were interviewed and the transcribed texts analysed using qualitative content analysis to assess both manifest and latent content. Results Five themes were identified: feeling stranded; forming well-functioning teams; learning <b>to</b> lead; <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage,</b> strength, and desire to lead; and ensuring appropriate care. The findings indicate that many factors limit nurses’ leadership but some circumstances are supportive. Conclusion The leadership prerequisites for newly registered nurses need to improve, emphasizing different ways to create a supportive atmosphere that promotes professional development and job satisfaction. Implications for nursing management To increase nurse retention and promote quality of care, nurse managers need to clarify expectations and guide and support newly qualified nurses in a planned way...|$|R
40|$|Revival within churches from traditional-{{reformed}} origin: on sincere longing {{and extreme}} embarrassment Within churches from reformed origin {{the debate about}} revival has become an actual issue. It seems that these churches are becoming smaller and smaller, {{and that there is}} a lack of missionary zeal. Many pastors seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> lost <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> go on. What is happening in the churches? One can learn something from the history of the church. What was God doing in the past? The Word of God was there and it seems that in those places where revivals broke out, the Word of God was preached faithfully, in the power of the Holy Spirit. From sermons of three revival preachers who worked from 1816 to 1880 in Wuppertal (Germany), one can learn how their sermons contributed to revival in those days.   The missionary-soul caring message struck the people in their hearts, and not only individuals, but also whole regions changed; change took place not only in doctrine and lifestyle, but also holiness occupied a central place in the people’s hearts. When praying for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, people will repent and turn to God and “times of refreshing may come from the Lord” (Acts 3 : 19) ...|$|R

2500|$|Hip hop {{culture has}} spread to both urban and {{suburban}} communities throughout the United States and subsequently the world. These elements were adapted and developed considerably, particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the 1990s and subsequent decades. Even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms, including hip hop theater and hip hop film, the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hip hop culture. [...] Hip hop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon; the importance of sampling tracks, beats and basslines from old records [...] to the art form means {{that much of the}} culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings, attitudes, and experiences for modern audiences. Sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called [...] "flipping" [...] in hip hop culture. Hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier African-American-rooted musical genres such as blues, jazz, rag-time, funk, and disco {{to become one of the}} most practiced genres worldwide. It is the language of urban environments and the youth around the world, many who do not know what Hip Hop (the consciousness which makes up the collective culture of Hip Hop) is or what it means to [...] "Be Hip Hop" [...] , have recently begun to attribute being Hip Hop with being black, however that is race , not culture and not consciousness. as KRS-One says [...] "Hip Hop is the only place where you see Martin Luther King Jr. s; 'I have a dream speech' in real life" [...] and [...] "To be Hip Hop you have <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to be you and be Hip Hop all the time not just when it's popular or convenient, and have repped it when it wasn't and you were the only one repping it."

Entrepreneurship sustainability is conditioned by how the national business environment influences the education and mentality of <b>the</b> population <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> desire and <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> initiate and develop performance measures in a changing business environment more and more fluctuating and unpredictable. Our research, conducted over nearly two years aims, as main objective, to outline how implementing crowdsourcing as a way of solving, online, some problems regarding activities of major interests at organizational level (in our case, external communication), may {{contribute to the development of}} entrepreneurship in Romanian tourism. In this regard, we assumed that, despite the empirical mode of action (of priority being intuition and personal experience), only having reliable information on the perception, primarily, of their customers about the quality of the benefits they received, entrepreneurs in the tourism and hospitality industry will be able to adapt and/or develop their businesses in accordance with the main trends and characteristics of the environment in which they operate. The methodology used (analysis of variance - ANOVA correlated with SPSS for Windows, version 15) to test research hypotheses was the logical consequence of the questions used in questionnaires launched on two websites specially created. In this context, we investigated the biunivocal relationship between the phenomenon of entrepreneurship and business tourism and hospitality industry from the perspective of external organizational communication trends of profile units in the digital age, trends expressed by both managers and also by their customers. Finally, based on hypotheses testing, we found that, in a world of rapidly changing, boosting entrepreneurship became dependent on both the accuracy of the image the managers of tourism units have about their own activity and also on their customer perception on the quality of services they receive. So, on the one hand, crowdsourcing has become a viable resultant for the development of entrepreneurship in tourism and hospitality industry as, on the other hand, entrepreneurs need to motivate the participation of their own customers at crowdsourcing...|$|R

60|$|This {{peaceful}} parenthesis {{was hardly}} past before {{the trials of}} travel intruded themselves again. The porters proved refractory. They had agreed to come {{only as far as}} they could, and now they refused to proceed further. Here was a pretty pass. To turn back now was worse than not to have set out at all. Besides, we had not yet even come in sight of the enemy. Yejiro reasoned with them for some hours in the kitchen, occasionally pausing for lack of further argument to report his want of progress. It seemed the men valued their lives above a money consideration, strangely enough. They made no bones about it; the thing was too dangerous. The streams they declared impassable, and the charcoal burners the only men who knew the path. Yejiro at once had these witnesses subpoenaed, and by good luck one of them came, who, on being questioned, repeated all the porters had said. But Yejiro's blood was up, and he boldly played his last trump. He threatened them with the arm of the law, a much more effective weapon in Japan than elsewhere. He proposed, in fine, to walk three ri down the valley to the nearest police station and fetch a policeman who should compel them to move on. It is perhaps open to doubt whether even a Japanese policeman's omnipotence would have extended so far. But the threat, though not conclusive, had some effect. This strategic stroke I only learnt of later, and I laughed heartily when I did. That night, however, it was no laughing matter, and I began to have doubts myself. But it was no time for misgivings, so I went in to help. The circle round the kitchen fire was not a cheerful sight. <b>To</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> of one's convictions is rare enough in this weak world, but <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> of one's doubts is something I uncover to.

If only another would say to him that he might believe the very things he does not believe, as he says them to that other; they then might at least seem true. Ignorance saved me.
