40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{results of a}} project that seeks to {{transform}} <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>level</b> features to high- level meaning. Firstly we extract <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>level</b> features called as the representative colors from the images, and then we present a new approach called WordNet to establish the link from <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>level</b> feature vectors to the semantics. In order to improve the retrieval efficiency, the relevance feedback is also applied into our system. Experimental results show that our method is promising...|$|R

5|$|The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} has <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> of genetic {{variability}} among the 18 pinniped species, allegedly {{due to a}} population bottleneck caused by intense hunting in the 19th century.

Given the monk seal's small population, the effects of disease could be disastrous.|$|E

5|$|As {{the storm}} progressed westward, Tampa and nearby {{locations}} started to experience its effects.

The barometer fell to 961mbar (hPa; 28.4inHg), and extremely high waves battered the shore from Flamingo to Cape Romano. The surf continued well inland, forcing survivors to cling atop trees. North of Tampa, the hurricane's effects were moderate or light, while in the southwestern part of the state, damage increased in severity. A portion of the local citrus crop was destroyed. Property damage was widespread from Tampa to Jacksonville and points south. High winds tore the roofs off homes and shook some structures off their foundations.|$|E
