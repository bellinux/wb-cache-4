5|$|After Marius, <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> {{were drawn}} largely from {{volunteer}} citizens rather than citizens conscripted for duty. Volunteers {{came forward and}} were accepted not from citizens {{of the city of}} Rome itself but from the surrounding countryside and smaller towns falling under Roman control. Whereas some long-term military professionals were classed as veterans, they were outnumbered by civilians with limited military experience who were in active service perhaps only for a few campaigns. <b>The</b> <b>legions</b> of the late Republic remained, unlike <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> of the later Empire, predominantly Roman in origin, although some small number of ex-auxiliary troops were probably incorporated. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, Dąbrowski wrote several {{military}} treatises, primarily about <b>the</b> <b>Legions,</b> in German, French and Polish.|$|E
5|$|At this time, <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> of Pompey were {{returning}} to Italy, having {{put down the}} rebellion of Quintus Sertorius in Hispania.|$|E
50|$|The Council of <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> (El Consejo de la Legion) was {{composed}} of the Supreme Director as President (ex officio), the Grand Officers of <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> (<b>the</b> most senior was appointed Vice President of <b>the</b> <b>Legion),</b> twelve Officers of <b>the</b> <b>Legion,</b> six Sub-officers of <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> and six Legionnaires. The Council was charged with reforming the laws and regulations of <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> as required; presiding over meetings and assemblies of the Legion; approving appointments to <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> (this task was performed by a five-person panel and excluded the initial appointments to the Legion); considering cases of alleged dishonourable conduct by appointees to <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> (if found guilty, their appointment could be revoked and they were then prohibited from being reappointed); and overseeing the administration and finances of <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> (including administering <b>the</b> pensions for appointees).|$|R
50|$|After capture by <b>the</b> <b>Legion,</b> Blok {{chose to}} aid <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> against <b>the</b> Dark Man and was offered {{membership}} in <b>the</b> <b>Legion.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1937, Le Corbusier {{was named}} Chevalier of <b>the</b> <b>Légion</b> d'honneur. In 1945, he was {{promoted}} to Officiers of <b>the</b> <b>Légion</b> d'honneur. In 1952, {{he was promoted}} to Commandeur of <b>the</b> <b>Légion</b> d'honneur. Finally, on July 2, 1964, Le Corbusier was named Grand Officiers of <b>the</b> <b>Légion</b> d'honneur.|$|R
5|$|In Germany and Illyricum, <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> were in mutiny. In Germany, <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> in mutiny {{were those}} of the Lower Rhine under Aulus Caecina (the V Alaudae, XXI Rapax, I Germanica, and XX Valeria Victrix). The army of the Lower Rhine was {{stationed}} in summer quarters {{on the border of}} the Ubii. They had not gotten the bonuses promised them by Augustus, and when it became clear a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, they revolted. Germanicus dealt with the troops in Germania, and Tiberius' son Drusus dealt with Illyricum.|$|E
5|$|Soon after forming <b>the</b> <b>Legions,</b> also in 1914, Piłsudski set {{up another}} organization, the Polish Military Organisation (Polska Organizacja Wojskowa), {{which served as}} a {{precursor}} Polish intelligence agency and was designed to perform espionage and sabotage missions.|$|E
5|$|The Polish Legions serving {{alongside}} the French Army during the Napoleonic Wars saw combat {{in most of}} Napoleon's campaigns, from the West Indies, through Italy and Egypt. When the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807, many of the veterans of <b>the</b> <b>Legions</b> formed a core around which the Duchy's army was raised under Józef Poniatowski. This force fought a victorious war against Austria in 1809 and {{would go on to}} fight {{alongside the}} French army in numerous campaigns, culminating in the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812, which marked the end of the Napoleonic empire, including <b>the</b> <b>Legions,</b> and allied states like the Duchy of Warsaw.|$|E
2500|$|Superboy still {{appeared}} {{in nearly every}} Legion story through Adventure Comics #380 (1969). In the next issue, <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> was replaced by Supergirl, while <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> (usually without Superboy) took over Supergirl's spot as the backup in Action Comics. [...] In 1971, [...] <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> moved over to Superboy as a semi-regular backup. History repeated itself as <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> backup feature quickly became more popular than the title feature. Beginning with Superboy #197 (1973), the cover logo was changed to read Superboy starring <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> of Super-Heroes, and <b>the</b> <b>Legion,</b> including Superboy, took the lead spot in the comic.|$|R
50|$|With {{the aid of}} <b>the</b> <b>Legion,</b> Roxxas {{is brought}} to justice and Jan joins <b>the</b> <b>Legion,</b> using <b>the</b> codename Element Lad.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Legion</b> of Merit of Chile (Legion de Mérito de Chile), {{frequently}} {{abbreviated to}} <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> of Merit or <b>the</b> <b>Legion,</b> was a Chilean multi-class order of merit established on 1 June 1817 by Bernardo O'Higgins to recognise distinguished personal merit {{contributing to the}} independence of Chile or to the nation. Membership of <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> conferred a variety of privileges in Chile and its members were entitled to wear insignia according to the class conferred. <b>The</b> <b>Legion</b> of Merit of Chile was abolished in 1825.|$|R
5|$|The Roman Senate grew {{increasingly}} alarmed at the slave-army's depredations and continued military successes. Eventually Rome fielded {{an army of}} eight legions under the harsh but effective leadership of Marcus Licinius Crassus. The war ended in 71 BC when, after a long and bitter fighting retreat before <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> of Crassus, and the realization that <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus and Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus were moving in to entrap them, the armies of Spartacus launched their full strength against Crassus' legions and were utterly defeated. Of the survivors, some 6,000 were crucified along the Appian way.|$|E
5|$|The size of <b>the</b> <b>Legions</b> {{decreased}} {{after the}} Treaty of Luneville (9 February 1801), which to the disappointment of the legionnaires {{made no mention}} of Poland. <b>The</b> <b>Legions</b> was transferred to police duties in the Kingdom of Etruria. The Legions' morale weakened as Poles were not used in any fights that seemed to directly affect the chance of Poland regaining independence. Many legionnaires, including General Kniaziewicz, felt that they had been used by the French and resigned. Dąbrowski remained in command, and reorganized both Legions at Milan into two 6,000-strong units in March 1801. On 21 December 1801 <b>the</b> <b>Legions</b> were reorganized by the French government into three demi-brigades, with the Italian (First) Legion forming the core of the First and Second Foreign Demi-Brigades (1er and 2e Demi-Brigade Étrangère), and the Danube (Second) Legion, the Third Foreign Demi-Brigade (3e Demi-Brigade Étrangère).|$|E
5|$|While most of {{the rebel}} slaves were killed on the battlefield, some 6,000 {{survivors}} were captured by <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> of Crassus. All 6,000 were crucified along the Appian Way from Rome to Capua.|$|E

50|$|In 1865 and 1876, he {{was awarded}} a médaille d'honneur at the Salon des beaux-arts. In June 1867 he was named Chevalier (Knight) of <b>the</b> <b>Légion</b> d'honneur; in July 1874 he was named Officer of <b>the</b> <b>Légion</b> d'honneur; in July 1886 he was {{promoted}} to Commander of <b>the</b> <b>Légion</b> d'honneur; and in 1889 he was decorated with the Grand Croix (Grand Cross) of <b>the</b> <b>Légion</b> d'honneur.|$|R
50|$|Leland McCauley IV resumed the vendetta against Brande. He {{employed}} an agent, Charon, {{to infiltrate}} Brande's staff on Brande's private planetoid. The agent was thwarted {{by members of}} <b>the</b> <b>Legion,</b> though <b>the</b> resulting attack caused {{a great deal of}} destruction and risked lives. When <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> attempted to interrogate the agent, he replied that he knew they couldn't kill him because of <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> code. Brande, who was not a member of <b>the</b> <b>Legion,</b> then threatened to kill him. Later <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> broke into McCauley's fortified headquarters in the Himalayas to return the defeated assassin.|$|R
5|$|Despite their destruction, <b>the</b> <b>Legions</b> became legendary in Poland, {{helping to}} spread the civic and {{democratic}} ideals of the French Revolution throughout the country. The legionnaires formed a cadre for the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw and also later for the Army of the Congress Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|During the Principate, {{recruitment}} into <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> {{was restricted}} to Roman citizens only. This rule, which derived from the pre-Social War Republican army, was strictly enforced. The few exceptions recorded, such as during emergencies and for the illegitimate sons of legionaries, do not warrant {{the suggestion that the}} rule was routinely ignored.|$|E
5|$|Even {{according}} to the more conservative estimate, the auxilia were by this time significantly larger than <b>the</b> <b>legions,</b> which contained c. 155,000 effectives (28 legions of 5,500 men each) at this time, of which just 3,360 were cavalry. (For a detailed breakdown, see section 4: Auxilia deployment in the 2nd century, below).|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>legion</b> was disbanded in 238 CE [...] "because of {{its role}} in putting down an African-based revolt against the emperor Maximinus {{in favor of the}} provincial {{governor}} Gordianus." [...] In 252, Valerian reformed <b>the</b> <b>legion</b> to deal with the [...] "five peoples", a dangerous coalition of Berber tribes. <b>The</b> <b>legion</b> prevailed in 260 but the threat remained and the fortifications of Lambaesis were increased over the following years. In 289, the struggle began again and the emperor Maximianus took personal control of <b>the</b> <b>legion.</b> <b>The</b> war lasted until 297 at which point <b>the</b> <b>legion</b> was victorious.|$|R
2500|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> pushed new Superboy stories out of Adventure Comics in 1963, Superboy {{became the}} only comic book to feature {{original}} Superboy stories. Less {{than two years after}} <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> itself left Adventure Comics, Superboy became the Legion's new home. Starting with Superboy No. 172 (Mar 1971), <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> appeared as an occasional backup feature. Once again, <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> feature proved so popular that by Superboy No. 197 (Sep 1973), <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> had become <b>the</b> lead feature, and with the next issue, the title's only feature. Although from issue No. 197, the cover logo read [...] "Superboy starring <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> of Super-Heroes" [...] ("and" [...] replaced [...] "starring" [...] with #222), the official title (shown in the indicia) of the comic remained Superboy until No. 231 (Sep 1977), when the comic became Superboy and <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> of Super-Heroes. In issue No. 259 (Jan 1980), Superboy left <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> and his name was dropped from the title altogether, which now became simply <b>The</b> <b>Legion</b> of Super-Heroes. Though Superboy still periodically appeared in the series that once bore his name, the series remained a Legion title until its final issue, No. 354, in 1987.|$|R
50|$|In 44 BC, Augustus reconstituted <b>the</b> <b>legion</b> {{which had}} helped him attain {{the control of the}} Empire. This loyalty gave <b>the</b> <b>legion</b> <b>the</b> cognomen Augusta.|$|R
5|$|In addition, the {{shortage}} of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon its allies (socii) {{for the provision of}} allied troops. Where accepted allies could not provide the required force types, the Romans were not averse during this period to hiring mercenaries to fight alongside <b>the</b> <b>legions.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} not all {{indigenous}} units were disbanded {{at the end of}} the civil war period (31BC). Some of the more experienced units were kept in existence to complement <b>the</b> <b>legions,</b> and became the core of the standing auxiliary forces that developed in the Julio-Claudian period. During the early rule of Augustus (27BC onwards), the corps of regular Auxilia was created. It was clearly inspired by the Latin forces of the pre-Social War Republic, as a corps of non-citizen troops parallel to <b>the</b> <b>legions.</b> But there were fundamental differences, the same as between Republican and Augustan legions. The Latin forces of the Republic were made up of part-time conscripts in units that would be raised and disbanded for and after particular campaigns. The Augustan Auxilia were mainly volunteer professionals serving in permanent units.|$|E
5|$|Numerous archaeological discoveries {{show that}} silk {{had become a}} luxury {{material}} appreciated in foreign countries well before {{the opening of the}} Silk Road by the Chinese. For example, silk has been found in the Valley of the Kings in a tomb of a mummy dating from 1070 BCE. First the Greeks, then the Romans began to speak about the Seres (people of silk), a term to designate the inhabitants of the far-off kingdom, China. According to certain historians, the first Roman contact with silk was that of <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> of the governor of Syria, Crassus. At the Battle of Carrhae, near to the Euphrates, <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> were said to be so surprised by the brilliance of the banners of Parthia that they fled.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} Tiberius {{began appearing}} in court as an advocate, {{and it is}} presumably here that his interest in Greek rhetoric began. In 20BC, Tiberius was sent East under Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. The Parthians had captured the standards of <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> {{under the command of}} Marcus Licinius Crassus (53BC) (at the Battle of Carrhae), Decidius Saxa (40BC), and Mark Antony (36BC).|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between the heavy infantry types began to blur, perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment. In addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon Rome's allies {{for the provision of}} allied troops. Eventually, the Romans were forced to begin hiring mercenaries to fight alongside <b>the</b> <b>legions.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>legions,</b> {{which had}} been a mix of life {{professionals}} and civilian campaigners, was altered into a standing army of professionals only. The actual structure of the cohort army remained {{much the same as}} in the late Republic, although around the 1st centuryAD the first cohort of each legion was increased in size to a total of 800 soldiers. However, while the structure of <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> remained much the same, their make-up gradually changed. Whereas early Republican legions had been raised by a draft from eligible Roman citizens, imperial legions were recruited solely on a voluntary basis and from a much wider base of manpower. Likewise, whereas Republican legions had been recruited almost exclusively in Italy, early Imperial legions drew most of their recruits from Roman colonies in the provinces from 68AD onwards. One estimate places the proportion of Italian troops at 65% under Augustus in c.1AD, falling to around 49% by the end of Nero's reign.|$|E

Applicants are accepted into <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> based solely on their fitness of character and the usefulness of their super-power(s); 3) Each super-hero accepted for membership swears service to the galaxy and absolute loyalty to <b>the</b> <b>Legion</b> and his or her fellow Legionnaires; 4) <b>The</b> <b>Legion</b> has its own flag as well as its own constitution, organization, history, and traditions; 5) <b>The</b> <b>Legion</b> apprehends interstellar criminals, patrols space, and might be dispatched by the Earth president or other authorities to deal with threats to peace and order anywhere in the galaxy; 6) <b>The</b> <b>Legion</b> is an absolutely fearless fighting force and, over the years, has lost Legionnaires in action.|$|R
