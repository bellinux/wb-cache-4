5|$|More than 150 {{people were}} injured by the tornado outbreak, and one person was killed by straight-line {{thunderstorm}} winds. While tornado outbreaks in <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> unusual, this storm was especially rare in that it produced six significant tornadoes, two of which were violent F4s, and featured many tornadoes with tracks of several miles.|$|E
5|$|The Acjachemem, who {{numbered}} roughly 2000 overall, were hunter-gatherers, {{living in}} small, semi-permanent villages close to water sources. There were five villages {{on the main}} stem of San Juan Creek, three of which were below the Trabuco Creek confluence, and four more {{in other parts of}} the watershed, mostly on Trabuco and Oso Creeks. The Acjachemem diet usually consisted of fruits, acorns, grains, and some meat, while they practiced little agriculture. Shell middens indicate that they also harvested shellfish from the coast. Native peoples in <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> not known to have built permanent structures in this area or significantly influenced the natural environment.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{invasion}} of Britain began in AD 43. By 51 the Brigantes had {{submitted to the}} clientship of Rome, eventually being placed under direct rule in the early 70s.

A minor Roman road linking the Roman forts at Templeborough and Brough-on-Noe possibly ran through the centre of the area covered by the modern city, and Icknield Street is thought to have skirted its boundaries. The routes of these roads within <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> mostly unknown, although sections of the former can still be seen between Redmires and Stanage, and remains possibly linked to the latter were discovered in Brinsworth in 1949.|$|E

5|$|The northeastern part of Iran lies across part of {{the belt}} of active {{continental}} collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Iran is crossed by several major faults, with 90% of them being seismically active and subject to many earthquakes each year; {{the area around the}} rupture experiences minor quakes almost daily. The most seismically active parts of <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> the Zagros fold and thrust belt and the Alborz mountain range. Qazvin Province, which is located between these two zones, suffers less earthquakes, but these may be more powerful because stresses have longer to build.|$|E
5|$|Conflicting {{reports have}} been made as to its {{preferred}} habitat; two papers suggest it preferred channels to floodplains, but another suggests it preferred the opposite. The possible preference for channels {{is based on the}} relative abundance of thescelosaur fossils in sandstones, representing channel environments, in comparison to mudstones, representing floodplain environments. No bonebeds or accumulations of multiple individuals have yet been reported. Dale Russell, in a popular work, noted that Thescelosaurus was the most common small herbivore in the Hell Creek Formation of the Fort Peck area. He described the environment of the time as a flat floodplain, with a relatively dry subtropical climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from angiosperm trees, to bald cypress, to ferns and ginkgos. Although most dinosaur skeletons from <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> incomplete, possibly due to the low preservation potential of forests, Thescelosaurus skeletons are much more complete, suggesting that this genus frequented stream channels. Thus when a Thescelosaurus died, it may have been in or near a river, making it easier to bury and preserve for later fossilization. Russell tentatively compared it to the capybaras and tapirs. Other dinosaurs that shared its time and place include the ceratopsids Triceratops and Torosaurus, hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus, ankylosaurid Ankylosaurus, pachycephalosaurian Pachycephalosaurus, and the theropods Ornithomimus, Troodon, and Tyrannosaurus. Thescelosaurus was also abundant in the Lance Formation. Toe bones from this genus are the most common finds after fossils of Triceratops and Edmontosaurus, and {{it may have been the}} most common dinosaur there in life, if the Lance Formation had a preservational bias against small animals.|$|E
5|$|Remarkably, though {{hundreds}} {{of homes and}} other structures were leveled, no one was killed by tornadoes that day. Tornado damage caused about 140 injuries, mostly minor, and one death and 11 injuries were caused by wind damage. In just five hours, the storms produced more than 12,500 lightning strikes. The airport in Oxford, Connecticut recorded 4.4inches (112mm) of rain in just 30 minutes. While the northeastern United States experiences occasional tornadoes, an event of this scale is especially rare. Typical tornadoes in <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> short-lived and not particularly damaging. This outbreak featured several long-lived tornadoes, produced by storms which also produced destructive non-tornadic winds over a large area. Since 1950, only six violent tornadoes {{have occurred in the}} Northeastern US, two of which were part of this outbreak. It was by far the worst tornado event in the area since May 2, 1983, when six significant tornadoes tore through New York, and maybe the worst since the Worcester Tornado.|$|E
