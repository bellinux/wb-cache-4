40|$|The {{reaction}} of octachlorocyclotetraphosphazene, N 4 P 4 Cl 8 (1), in three stoichiometries (1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1 : 3) with the sodium derivative of the fluorinated diol, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5 -octafluorohexane- 1, 6 -diol (2), in THF solution {{at room temperature}} produced five products: the open chain compound N 4 P 4 Cl 7 [OCH 2 (CF 2) 4 CH 2 OH] (3), the spiro compound N 4 P 4 Cl 6 [OCH 2 (CF 2) 4 CH 2 O] (4 b), the 1, 5 -ansa compound N 4 P 4 Cl 6 [OCH 2 (CF 2) 4 CH 2 O] (4 c), the cis- 1, 3; 5, 7 -bis-ansa derivative N 4 P 4 Cl 4 [OCH 2 (CF 2) 4 CH 2 O] 2 (5 a) and the 1, 3; 1, 3; 5, 7; 5. 7 -tetrakis-ansa compound, N 4 P 4 (OCH 2 (CF 2) 4 CH 2 O) 4 (6 a). The structures were determined by elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, 1 H, 19 F and 31 P NMR spectroscopies and for compounds 4 c and 5 a, where suitable single crystals were obtained, the structures were characterised by X-ray crystallography. It {{was found that the}} (PN) 4 ring in compound 4 c is in a slightly-twisted <b>tub</b> <b>conformation</b> but in compound 5 a the first symmetrical crown conformation of the (PN) 4 ring is observed. The results of all the reactions were compared with previous work on the {{reaction of}} hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene, N 3 P 3 Cl 6, with the sodium derivative of the diol (2), in a 1 : 1. 2 mole ratio in the same solvent, where intermolecular bridging reactions were preferred. The regio-selective formation of mainly ansa derivatives of the fluorohexanediol with cyclotetraphosphazene was rationalised in terms of non-bonded 1, 3 and 1, 5 P…P distances of the tetramer ring...|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} a {{molecule}} which is not antiaromatic even though it might initially appear to be so is cyclooctatetraene. Cyclooctatetraene assumes a <b>tub</b> (i.e., boat-like) <b>conformation.</b> As it is not planar, {{even though it has}} 4n π-electrons, these electrons are not delocalized and conjugated. The molecule is therefore nonaromatic.|$|R
