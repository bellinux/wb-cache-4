The target of this work is to compare works on the effect of <b>twisted</b> <b>nozzle,</b> flow and lance height in the jet penetration by visual inspection and by energy balance that consider number of nozzles, vertical and twist angles. In the present work, lances with <b>twisted</b> <b>nozzle</b> angles, normal lances and special nozzle shape were used to describe the effects of jet on bath. Jet penetration and level of splashing were also available. For the four nozzles, the best result to reduce spitting was obtained at the twist angle, hard blow and high flow. High flow, reduction in bath lance distance and lower nozzle angle promoted a higher penetration, but with bad results for the process. The energy balance showed to be a proper tool to promote adjustments in process...|$|E
