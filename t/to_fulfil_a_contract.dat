6000|$|Mr. Street {{was very}} busy with his telegraphic matters--and {{considering}} {{that he had}} eight or nine hundred miles of rugged, snowy, uninhabited mountains, and waterless, treeless, melancholy deserts to traverse with his wire, it was natural and needful {{that he should be}} as busy as possible. He could not go comfortably along and cut his poles by the road-side, either, but they had to be hauled by ox teams across those exhausting deserts--and it was two days' journey from water to water, in one or two of them. Mr. Street's <b>contract</b> was <b>a</b> vast work, every way one looked at it; and yet to comprehend what the vague words [...] "eight hundred miles of rugged mountains and dismal deserts" [...] mean, one must go over the ground in person--pen and ink descriptions cannot convey the dreary reality to the reader. And after all, Mr. S.'s mightiest difficulty {{turned out to be one}} which he had never taken into the account at all. Unto Mormons he had sub-let the hardest and heaviest half of his great undertaking, and all of a sudden they concluded that they were going to make little or nothing, and so they tranquilly threw their poles overboard in mountain or desert, just as it happened when they took the notion, and drove home and went about their customary business! They were under written contract to Mr. Street, but they did not care anything for that. They said they would [...] "admire" [...] to see a [...] "Gentile" [...] force <b>a</b> Mormon <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> <b>a</b> losing <b>contract</b> in Utah! And they made themselves very merry over the matter. Street said--for it was he that told us these things: ...|$|R

40|$|Few {{researchers}} {{and policy makers}} {{take into account the}} historical and regional construction of relations between producers and other actors in the agri-food chain in their agricultural sector analyses. The management difficulties experienced by "new" farmers on the island of São Tomé, when they received cocoa-producing lands individually after being salaried employees, demonstrate the influence of the past. A study was made using comprehensive surveys of the actors in a new chain of organic cocoa, compared to some actors in the traditional chain. The cocoa farmers involved have had to organize in order <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> that connects their cooperative of several communities with a French chocolate company. Those producers have had difficulty adapting to the conditions of a mutual contract. However, little by little, they have begun to compensate for individual and collective lack of initiative with a sociotechnical and organisational learning process, as an outline for emancipation toward more sociotechnical sustainability.

500|$|Walpole {{remained}} prolific in {{the post-war}} years, {{and began a}} parallel and highly remunerative career as a lecturer in literature. At the instigation of his American publisher, George Doran, {{he made his first}} lecture tour of the US in 1919, receiving an enthusiastic welcome wherever he went. What Sadleir describes as Walpole's [...] "genial and attractive appearance, his complete lack of aloofness, his exciting fluency as a speaker [...] his obvious and genuine liking for his hosts" [...] combined to win him a large American following. The success of his talks led to increases in his lecturing fees, greatly enhanced sales of his books, and large sums from American publishers anxious to print his latest fiction. He was a prodigiously quick writer who seldom revised, but pressed on, keen to get his ideas down on paper. His main British publishers, Macmillan, found it expedient to appoint a senior member of staff to edit his manuscripts, correcting spelling, punctuation, inconsistencies and errors of historical fact. His fluency enabled him <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> between tours <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> from The Pictorial Review for ten short stories at the remarkable sum of $1,350 apiece.|$|R
