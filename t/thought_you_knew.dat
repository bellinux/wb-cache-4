500|$|IGN's Matt Risely rated [...] "The Almost People" [...] 8 out of 10, {{noting that}} [...] "As a {{traditional}} two-parter, Matthew Graham wrote a tight and coherent {{but not entirely}} scintillating script that managed to 'flesh' out the themes of morality and humanity {{with a couple of}} interesting touches". Though he called the cliffhanger a [...] "perfectly pitched WTF moment", he too believed that it [...] "detracts from the episode as a whole". Richard Edwards of SFX was more critical of the episode, giving it three out of five stars. He stated he did not feel any [...] "genuine threat" [...] and considered the Gangers to be [...] "uninteresting" [...] and [...] "predictable". However, he did praise Smith's performance and the cliffhanger. Digital Spy listed the cliffhanger among five best of Doctor Who since its revival in 2005, explaining, [...] "it changes everything you <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> about the latest series, and it's damn creepy".|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} in Final Fantasy XII have received mixed opinions from reviewers. Praises were given by Calvin Smith of PSX Extreme, who {{stated that the}} characters are [...] "classy and well thought out, an ensemble cast whose players rarely descend into needless melodrama or writhing angst". He {{also said that the}} supposed main character's role was changed to become an observer, [...] "a different outlook than in the previous installments". 1UP.com's Andrew Pfister applauded the character dialogues as being [...] "intelligent, subtle and sharp"; the relationships between characters were lauded as well. Balthier and Fran's relationship was compared to Han Solo and Chewbacca of Star Wars, being [...] "far more interesting than anything Square's put out in the modern FF era". IGN editor Jeremy Dunham praised the game and its writers for [...] "evolving the personalities, histories, and motives of characters you already <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew,</b> but didn't" [...] and for [...] "capitaliz on the opportunity to tell you about them". He also noted the visual and auditory detail of the characters, saying that [...] "each and every model, down to the most obscure NPC, has an immense level of attention paid to them -- from their clothes and facial expressions, to their walking and idle animations" [...] and that the voice acting was [...] "top-notch". GameSpy's Justin Speer also praised the characters, saying that it was hard to [...] "resist being charmed by a few of the characters" [...] and that they [...] "interact with each other in dramatic and interesting ways". The voice acting was praised by Keith Schleicher of Gaming Trend, who said that the characters voices all matched their appearances well.|$|E

2500|$|Broken Morning (2003) {{was based}} on Chiori Miyagawa's {{interviews}} with Texas death row inmates. She interviewed not only inmates, but also the guards, family members, and victims surrounding the Huntsville State Prison. It premiered at the HERE Arts Center. Nytheater.com praised the work, “Broken Morning is compelling storytelling of the highest order; it will cause you to ask questions, to challenge your assumptions, and to reconsider what you <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> about fundamental social issues.” ...|$|E
2500|$|As Thicke {{explained}} to the Breakfast Club, [...] "The album is called Blurred Lines. I've realized as I've gotten older that we all think we're living either in a black or white world, or on a straight path, {{but most of us}} are living right in between those straight lines. And everything you <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew,</b> the older you get, you realize, 'Damn, I don't know nothing about this. I better pay attention, I better listen and keep learning.' So I think that, that's what I've been realizing these past few years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blanchett {{returned}} to the theatre in 2009 with the Sydney Theatre Company production of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, directed by Liv Ullmann. She starred as Blanche DuBois alongside Joel Edgerton as Stanley Kowalski. Ullmann and Blanchett had been meaning to collaborate on a project since Ullman's intended film adaption of A Doll's House fell by the wayside. Blanchett proposed embarking on Streetcar to Ullmann, who jumped at the opportunity after initial discussion. The production traveled from Sydney to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, and the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. It was critically and commercially successful and Blanchett received critical acclaim for her performance as Blanche DuBois. The New York Times critic Ben Brantley said, [...] "DuBois has been pulled gently and firmly down to earth by Ms. Blanchett and Ms. Ullmann ... What Ms. Blanchett brings to the character is life itself, a primal survival instinct ... All the baggage that any [...] "Streetcar" [...] usually travels with has been jettisoned. Ms. Ullmann and Ms. Blanchett have performed the play {{as if it had}} never been staged before, with the result that, as a friend of mine put it, [...] "you feel like you’re hearing words you <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> pronounced correctly for the first time."" [...] The Washington Posts Peter Marks proclaimed, [...] "What Blanchett achieves in the Sydney Theatre Company's revelatory revival of [...] "A Streetcar Named Desire" [...] amounts to a truly great portrayal—certainly the most heartbreaking Blanche I've ever experienced." [...] John Lahr of The New Yorker said of her portrayal, [...] "Blanchett, with her alert mind, her informed heart, and her lithe, patrician silhouette, gets it right from the first beat ... Blanchett doesn’t make the usual mistake of foreshadowing Blanche’s end at the play’s beginning; she allows Blanche a slow, fascinating decline ... I don’t expect to see a better performance of this role in my lifetime." [...] Jane Fonda, who attended a New York show, deemed it [...] "perhaps the greatest stage performance I have ever seen", and Meryl Streep declared, [...] "That performance was as naked, as raw and extraordinary and astonishing and surprising and scary as anything I've ever seen ... She took the layers of a person and just peeled them away. I thought I'd seen that play, I thought I knew all the lines by heart, because I've seen it so many times, but I'd never seen the play until I saw that performance." [...] Blanchett won the Sydney Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. The production and Blanchett received Helen Hayes Awards, for Outstanding Non-Resident Production and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Non-Resident Production award, respectively.|$|E
