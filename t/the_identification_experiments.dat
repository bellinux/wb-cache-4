40|$|High-speed {{machining}} technology {{is becoming increasingly}} important in mod-ern manufacturing industry. With the requirement of high speed to yield high productivity, the precision and accuracy requirement {{becomes more and more}} stringent. In this thesis, research is focused on high-precision trajectory tracking control for high performance motion systems. The dimensional accuracy of the finished part is mainly determined by the contouring error which is different from the conventional tracking error. However, {{it is not easy to}} compute for arbitrary curves. In this work, a simplified contouring error model is presented to approximate the actual contouring error. By defining the Frenet-Serret frame attached to the desired trajectory, the task coordinate frame is obtained. The tracking error can be projected to the task coordinate frame where the tangential and normal errors are defined to approximate the contouring error. Based on the contouring error model, two control schemes on a general class of motion control systems are developed in the task frame: Coordinated posi-tion control and adaptive control. Coordinated position control is a feedback linearization method derived in the task frame to achieve the desired contouring error dynamics. This control scheme requires the exact knowledge of system dy-namics. To enhance the robustness of the controller, adaptive contouring control is proposed in the task frame. This control algorithm is able to handle bounded external disturbances and system parameter variations while maintaining supe-rior contouring tracking performance. Stability analysis was presented together with remarks on selecting controller gains. Experiments are implemented on an AC motor driven X-Y table to test the control algorithms. To provide the knowledge of systems dynamics, modelling and identification methodology for the experimental platform are presented in detail along with <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>experiments.</b> Experimental results of the proposed control schemes indicate significant improvement of the contouring accuracy when compared with other conventional control algorithms under the same high speed.

40|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that the physical characteristics of people's vocal apparatus cause their voices to have distinctive characteristics, this thesis reports on investigations into the use of the long-term average glottal response for speaker identification. The long-term average glottal response is a new feature that is obtained by overlaying successive vocal tract responses within an utterance. The way in which the long-term average glottal response varies with accent and gender is examined using a population of 352 American English speakers from eight different accent regions. Descriptors are defined that characterize the shape of the long-term average glottal response. Factor analysis of the descriptors of the long-term average glottal responses shows that the most important factor contains significant contributions from descriptors comprised of the coefficients of cubics fitted to the long-term average glottal response. Discriminant analysis demonstrates that the long-term average glottal response is potentially useful for classifying speakers according to their gender, but is not useful for distinguishing American accents. The identification accuracy of the long-term average glottal response is compared with that obtained from vocal tract features. Identification experiments are performed using a speaker database containing utterances from twenty speakers of the digits zero to nine. Vocal tract features, which consist of cepstral coefficients, partial correlation coefficients and linear prediction coefficients, are shown to be more accurate than the long-term average glottal response. Despite analysis of the training data indicating that the long-term average glottal response was uncorrelated with the vocal tract features, various feature combinations gave insignificant improvements in identification accuracy. The effect of noise and distortion on speaker identification is examined for each of the features. It is found that the identification performance of the long-term average glottal response is insensitive to noise compared with cepstral coefficients, partial correlation coefficients and the long-term average spectrum, but that it is highly sensitive to variations in the phase response of the speech transmission channel. Before reporting on <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>experiments,</b> the thesis introduces speech production, speech models and background to the various features used in the experiments. Investigations into the long-term average glottal response demonstrate that it approximates the glottal pulse convolved with the long-term average impulse response, and this relationship is verified using synthetic speech. Furthermore, the spectrum of the long-term average glottal response extracted from pre-emphasized speech is shown to be similar to the long-term average spectrum of pre-emphasized speech, but computationally much simpler...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{modification}} {{was used}} to examine the role of some amino acid residues in the binding of the substrates to the enzyme p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas fluorescens. Ionic strength dependent binding studies were used to investigate the role of the protein as a whole in the complex formations. In the general introduction the present knowledge on p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and on chemical modifications of amino acid residues in general is reviewed. Whereas most studies on this enzyme were done on the prosthetic group FAD, it was our aim to acquire more insight into the role of the surrounding protein. Diethylpyrocarbonate {{was used to}} modify histidine residues. Four out of nine histidine residues were modified, which was accompanied by total inactivation of the enzyme. Two of these residues appeared to be essential for the enzyme activity and {{to be involved in the}} binding of NADPH. The rate of inactivation increased with increasing pH. From this pH dependence the pK value of two cooperatively ionizing histidine residues was determined. At pH> 7 tyrosine residues appeared to be carbethoxylated, accompanied by a loss of substrate binding capacity. The modification of arginine residues is described in chapter 3. Out of the three inactivating reagents used, one appeared to react with two arginine residues which are important for NADPH and substrate binding. A model was postulated to account for the results. The other two reagents reacted with different arginine residues, which was explained by the differences in charge and hydrophobicity. The complexity of arginine modification is due to the large number (38) of arginine residues present in the enzyme. In chapter 4 the modification of tyrosine residues is described. Some additional experiments using diethylpyrocarbonate were carried out, but more attention is given to the modification by the substrate analogue p-diazobenzoate. Although <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>experiments</b> did not yield the desired quantitative result, it could be established that a reaction with tyrosine- 201 was responsible for the loss of substrate binding capacity. It was concluded that tyrosine- 385 is also essential and that tyrosine- 222 is non-essential. In chapter 5 the protein as a whole is considered. The ionic strength dependence of NADPH binding to the enzyme is explained using a model in which the enzyme is considered as both a monopole and a dipole. The dipole moment of the enzyme in the direction of the NADPH binding site was calculated and compared with a dipole moment estimated on the basis of charge distribution as revealed by the three-dimensional model. The apparent contradiction between the pH dependences of NADPH binding and enzyme activity are also discussed. Chapter 6 finally is dedicated to the results of time resolved flavin fluorescence measurements on enzyme molecules modified by various reagents. The rotation correlation times determined were compared to obtain information on the mobility of the flavin within the enzyme. The differences between the rotation correlation times could be accounted for by a shift of the dissociation constant of the dimeric form of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase...|$|E
