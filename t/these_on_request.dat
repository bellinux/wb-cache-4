50|$|In case of {{allegation}} of use of chemical weapons or the prohibited production, a fact-finding inspection can be employed according to the convention.

The OPCW only undertakes <b>these</b> inspections <b>on</b> <b>request</b> of another member state, after verification of the presented proof. To avoid misuse, a majority of three quarters can block a challenge inspection request. Furthermore, the OPCW can only be involved after bilateral diplomatic solutions have failed.|$|R
50|$|A loss run is a {{document}} that records the history of claims made against a commercial insurance policy. It is analogous to a credit report. A loss run report will include information including {{the date of the}} claim, the amount paid, and a description of the event. Generally, a loss run will record 5 years of history. Because of the importance of loss run reports in underwriting commercial insurance accounts, most American states have laws requiring insurance providers to make <b>these</b> reports available <b>on</b> <b>request.</b>|$|R
30|$|Data constraints, {{specifically}} {{the relatively small}} number of observations around the MLDA cutoff and the discrete nature of recorded individual age, preclude implementing a true regression discontinuity design. However, we can roughly approximate the results of such a design by including a fourth-order control for how many years above, or below, the legal drinking age the husband is during the survey year, in non-prohibition states. <b>These</b> results, available <b>on</b> <b>request,</b> suggest very large, but also imprecise, positive impacts of legal access to alcohol on both consumption and domestic violence.|$|R

Their Chief Flight Instructor, Devan Wiebe, earned the FAA Gold Seal Flight Instructor Certificate in August 2015. In addition to offering Private, instrument, and commercial instruction, Aptis Aviation can facilitate the training required to obtain the Tail Wheel and Complex aircraft endorsements.

Thesis is separated into two chapters. In the first part there are explained basic terms from issue multiple input and output regulation systems and deduced matrices of transfers of control and breakdown. Second more extensive part attends to design of matrices of discrete controllers PSD. The meaning of requests for control (autonomicity and static invariantness) and deduced conditionals which follows <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>requests</b> is explained here.

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} for important individual differences between older people concerning what they value as high quality service from Home Care. A case {{is made for}} improving service quality through systematically consulting each service user about their own preferences and seeking to fulfil <b>these</b> <b>requests</b> <b>on</b> an individual basis. This contrasts with setting uniform quality standards for all older Home Care clients, based on most commonly expressed preferences. Evidence is cited from individual interviews with older Home Care service users and from an experiment in modifying older people’s services through briefing Home Care staff on the preferences of individual clients. Issues in developing this approach are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} sold to Caroline Pawley in June 2003 and to Equity Broadcasting in 2004; as a Univision {{affiliate}} it had been fed remotely via satellite from Equity's central automated satellite hub in Little Rock, Arkansas since 2004. WNYI, licensed as a full service station despite its low signal power terrestrially, had applied for must-carry access to Time Warner Cable in Syracuse in May 2005. While Ithaca is nominally in the Syracuse market area, the terrestrial WNYI signal had always been inadequate to reach Syracuse or other communities outside of Ithaca itself. The station had made various applications {{for an increase in}} licensed power but no decisions had been made by the Federal Communications Commission <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>requests.</b>|$|R

30|$|Given {{that the}} {{logarithm}} of infrastructural spending displays a large mass of year-LLM observation at zero, we {{also tried to}} run the regressions looking at {{the effect of the}} cumulate 2007 – 13 spending on the average growth during the period (similarly to Table  3). In this case, all LLMs have positive payments (larger than one euro per capita) for the three kinds of spending. For infrastructural projects, <b>these</b> regressions (available <b>on</b> <b>request)</b> still display close to zero coefficients for the effects on employment and population, and a negative one on house prices (0.05 % decrease with a 10 % increase in payments). As could be expected, in this case also the other two categories of spending show no relation with the outcomes, probably because the short term effect on employment is hardly captured without properly modeling the underlying annual trends. Only population appears to be slightly positively affected by the purchase of goods and services.|$|R

Once, while encamped {{on the shores of}} the eastern ocean in the cold weather, Lalitaditya ordered kapittha fruits to be brought to him. His attendants were perplexed, as this fruit was not common in the given season and place. But then, Indra's divine messenger brought these fruits to him from the heaven. The messenger explained to him that in his previous birth, he offered his own food and water to a starving Brahmin during a famine. As a result of this good deed, Lalitaditya became entitled to a hundred wishes in the heaven. For example, the king could make streams of sweet water appear in deserts at his mere wish. The messenger cautioned Lalitaditya that he had few wishes left, and therefore, he should not waste <b>these</b> wishes <b>on</b> frivolous <b>requests</b> such as ordering a fruit.|$|R
30|$|When using {{wireless}} {{embedded systems}} {{to monitor and}} control the environment, conditional observation may {{play a significant role}} in such systems. Consider a building equipped with such a system. If the temperature in the building has to be maintained between 19 °C and 22 °C, the sensors have to inform either the heater or the cooler if the temperature is out of this range. To realize this, the heating or cooling system that is linked to a sensor may send two conditional observation requests. The first condition type should be AllValues < 19 and the second should be AllValues > 22. When the server receives <b>these</b> <b>requests,</b> <b>on</b> separate port numbers, it stores them as two different requests and sends notifications to the client when one of the two conditions is fulfilled.|$|R
