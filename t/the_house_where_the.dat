Believing that this might be intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the waggons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.|$|E

The title of the film refers to the number of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> ZNG troops took shelter on 8–9 September 1991.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of Georgian {{architecture}} (about 1720–1840) the main architects and builders working in Bristol were James Bridges, John Wallis, and Thomas Paty with his sons John and William Paty. They put up hundreds of new buildings, reflecting the increased prosperity {{that came with the}} new Floating Harbour and trade based at The Exchange, built in 1741–43 by John Wood the Elder. Their early work included the Royal Fort, Blaise Castle House and Arno's Court estate, with the associated Arno's Court Triumphal Arch and Black Castle Public House. More modest terraces and squares grew up in the new suburbs such as Hotwells and north into Clifton, including 7 Great George Street, now the Georgian House Museum. It was built around 1790 for John Pinney a successful sugar merchant, and is believed to be <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge first met. It was also home to Pinney's slave, Pero, after whom Pero's Bridge at Bristol Harbour is named.|$|E

Others conspirators, brothers Juan and Adolfo Viteri and Francisco Valladares, were arrested when they attempted to flee disguised as women in Guastatoya. Others, like Felipe and Rafael Prado Romaña, tried to flee to El Salvador, but were captured when someone informed on them. The Romaña brothers remained imprisoned until their death. Only the Colombian Rafael Madriñán escaped the country on a bicycle. The mother of the Romaña brothers took the Mexican Ambassador, Federico Camboa, to <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Avila Echeverría brothers {{and his friends were}} hiding, who, knowing that they had only days to live, gave him all their valuables and begged him to pass them on to their relatives.|$|E
25|$|By 2012, the Cázares {{claimed the}} Tamaulipas agency had not {{questioned}} potential suspects or eyewitnesses of the kidnapping, nor had they visited the locations {{relevant to the}} case. The Cázares have insisted that authorities should start by investigating the house they were taken following their kidnapping, given that it is located just {{a block away from}} a busy street in Matamoros. In March 2012, an electricity bill was found {{on the door of the}} premises. The bill showed that the service was used exponentially during the month the family was kidnapped, and that the last time someone paid the bill was on January 2011. A neighbor who lived near <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Cázares were held hostage said he did not know who the owners of the property were but did acknowledge seeing suspicious activity during the evenings. On March 7, about 10 months after the mass kidnapping, Gérald Martin, the General Consul of France in Mexico, told the Cázares family that a squadron of Mexico's Federal Police had been dispatched to Matamoros to work directly on the case. The family claims, however, that were not sure if the investigation was actually carried out. They said they did not receive any documents of the investigation. By October 2012, a criminal court in Jalisco under judge Francisco Martín Hernández Zaragoza was assigned to investigate the case.
