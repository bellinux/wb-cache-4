However, despite its intuitive appeal, researchers and practitioners alike often define and conceptualize this popular construct differently. In fact, it is often hard to distinguish between whether someone is talking about social interaction, immediacy, <b>intimacy,</b> <b>emotion,</b> and/or connectedness when they talk about social presence. Therefore, the focus of this chapter is on outlining the evolution of the construct of social presence in an effort to understand better its relationship to online learning. ...|$|R

Two studies examined the relationship between measures of emotional competence and relationship satisfaction. The four aspects of emotional competence examined were effective social and emotional problem solving, accurate identification and describing of emotions, adaptive expression of emotions and effective management of emotions. 421 university students participated in study 1 (322 females; 99 males). 232 of these participants were in a relationship and 71 partners responded. 409 university students participated in study 2 (327 females; 82 males). 209 of these participants were in a relationship and 93 partners responded. Correlational and regression analyses revealed that the best predictors of close relationship satisfaction were ambivalence over the expression of <b>intimacy</b> <b>emotions</b> and difficulty identifying emotions. These effects held even after controlling for social desirability and a wide variety of other potential confounds. The basic and applied implications of these results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Rather than {{duplicating}} {{biomedical research}} measuring insight, or suggesting models by which one could more reliably measure {{a person with}} dementia's insight, I turn {{to the notion of}} insight reflexively. Based on ethnographic research with four `intimate circles of care', I explore the consciousness of people with AIDS dementia's insight, the intentionality of insight in the phenomenological sense. Since insight is a capacity of all humans, I also include in my unit of analysis the meanings of insight for significant others. With intentionality, what matters most are the meanings made of and the positions taken towards insight. I do not address what we understand philosophically as knowledge or question the definitions of awareness or insight. I focus on the ethnographic description of the meanings and positions that informants had of insight. Intentionality is not necessarily truth or fact, but rather a position taken. From the meanings and positions taken by informants, four themes of the intentionality of insight emerged: insight as heart-wrenching; agency, control and purpose; the hope of losing insight; and insight as life-giving. Intentionality of insight emerged in relation to <b>intimacy,</b> <b>emotions</b> and relationships. Insight was experienced within and narrated through a liminal state...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between female undergraduate students’ (n = 151) reports of parental emotion coaching in childhood and their reports of emotion regulation, romantic attachment, and romantic intimacy in young adulthood was investigated. The female undergraduate students completed additional questionnaires about their mood, personality characteristics, and relationship satisfaction in young adulthood, and parental warmth in childhood. Remembered supportive emotion coaching (comprised of Emotion-Focused Reactions, Problem-Focused Reactions and Expressive Encouragement) was significantly and {{positively correlated with}} healthier emotion regulation (reappraisal), and was significantly and negatively correlated with less healthy emotion regulation (suppression). Remembered unsupportive emotion coaching (comprised of Minimizing Reactions, Punitive Reactions, and Distress Reactions) was significantly and positively correlated with romantic avoidant and anxious attachment.

By creating an interactive zone between the virtual and the real, Mixed Reality artworks {{have the potential to}} recontexualize breathing as a synchronized mode of communication. The following three projects, ALIBI (2002) by Calgary collective The Einstein Brain Project, Mobile Feelings (2002 - 4) by Austrian artists Christa Sommerer and Laurent Migonneau, and Coexistence (2001) by Los Angeles-based artist Rebecca Allen, facilitate interpersonal relationships between human and machine or between two humans that contribute to a shared embodied experience and intersubjective intimacy. By experimenting with new technologies such as anatomically-lifelike body interfaces, haptic mobile devices or force feedback game pads, these artists explore ways in which a person’s biological imprint can be measured through their breath, as well as how participants react and understand each other through the exchange of biodata, without any need for physical contact or verbal language.

40|$|Humour {{can be both}} {{beneficial}} {{and harmful}} to romantic relationships. Research indicates that affiliative humour is associated {{with higher levels of}} relationship satisfaction, whereas aggressive humour is associated with lower levels of relationship satisfaction. However, past research is limited by its reliance on cross-sectional designs and general measures of humour use. Furthermore, little research has examined potential mediators that may account for the observed relationships between humour styles and relationship satisfaction. The current daily diary studies were the among the first to examine daily within-person associations between humour styles (specifically in the context of romantic relationship), relationship satisfaction, and positive and negative interactions within relationships, and to explore how these relationships are mediated by <b>emotions</b> and <b>intimacy.</b> Method: Samples of 193 and 200 university students involved in dating relationships completed online daily diaries that assessed humour styles in their relationships, relationship satisfaction, and interactions in their relationships, as well as <b>emotions</b> and <b>intimacy</b> in their relationships (Study 2 only). Results: Self-reported and perceived partner affiliative humour were associated with greater relationship satisfaction, whereas perceived partner aggressive humour was associated with reduced relationship satisfaction. Affiliative humour was a stronger predictor of relationship satisfaction than aggressive humour. The relationship between self-reported aggressive humour and relationship satisfaction was moderated by overall aggressive humour use across the study period, such that people who rarely used aggressive humour experienced positive relationships between aggressive humour and satisfaction, and people who often used aggressive humour experienced a negative relationship between the two variables. Positive relationship interactions were positively associated with affiliative humour, whereas negative interactions were positively associated with aggressive humour. Furthermore, playfulness in romantic relationships predicted higher daily use of affiliative humour. Finally, the relationships between affiliative humour (both self-reported and perceived partner) and relationship satisfaction were mediated by <b>intimacy</b> and positive <b>emotion.</b> Conclusions: These results suggest that both self-reported and perceived partner humour styles play a role in predicting relationship satisfaction within individuals on a day-to-day basis, and that these associations are partially explained by increased <b>intimacy</b> and positive <b>emotions...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{regulation}} of family migration to Norway. This topical issue is explored {{from the perspectives of}} politicians, bureaucrats and applicants and their families in three articles, respectively. I argue that {{the regulation of}} marriage migration is marked by contradictory developments in different fields of policy: While the regulations and norms concerning intimate relations are characterised by increased liberalization, immigration regulations and public debates on migration focus on restriction and control. These contradictory developments create dilemmas, tensions and paradoxes for politicians and bureaucrats, as well as for applicants and their families. The regulation of marriage migration is explored through interviews, observations and documents. Due to the complexity of the empirical material, it has been necessary to engage with a broad spectre of theoretical perspectives. The three articles discuss the regulation of marriage migration drawing on welfare state theory, and on theoretical perspectives on the transformation of <b>intimacy,</b> bureaucracy and <b>emotions,</b> respectively. Marriage migration is a phenomenon that cuts across the public and the private spheres, as well as the inside and the outside of the nation state. The public/private distinction and the boundary between the inside and the outside of the nation state are discussed and problematised within citizenship theories. These theories serve as an overall theoretical framework for the thesis as a whole because they facilitate an understanding of the dilemmas, tensions and paradoxes that characterize the regulation of marriage migration to Norway. </p...|$|R

40|$|Scottish strip {{clubs are}} a highly under {{researched}} area. While {{there is a}} plethora of research emanating from North America, strip club research is in its infancy in Scotland. The little research that has been conducted on Scotland’s strip clubs is unrepresentative (Bindel, 2004; AEWG, 2006). This project is an in depth participant observation based analysis of two Scottish strip clubs. The fieldwork was conducted {{over a period of}} seven years, with over 7000 hours of fieldwork based observations. Much like the work of Frank (2002) and Egan (2006) this research was conducted using a dancer-as-researcher role, giving me unrivalled access to a research setting and population that remains off-limits to most researchers. Drawing on North American based strip club studies, this research compares the interactions, service provision and operations of the Scottish clubs in relation to their North American counterparts. While a useful comparative tool, this research argues that the North American studies are not representative of Scottish strip clubs. North American clubs embody a strong customer service ethos in their service provision and organisational culture (Trautner 2005). The Scottish clubs in this study do not. There is a significant emphasis in North American studies on the use of counterfeit intimacy (Enck &# 38; Preston, 1988) as a standard sales technique used by dancers. This involves feigning <b>intimacy</b> and <b>emotion</b> in interactions with customers to elicit maximum financial gain; the dancer will aim to be ‘anything you want her to be’. There is an assumption in these studies that service provision is dictated by a combination of club management and the customer’s wishes. This research highlighted that it was not the customer or management who determined service provision, but the dancers. Rather than embodying a fervent customer service ethos, Scottish strip clubs are non-customer oriented service providers. The impact of dancers on service provision and social control in the strip clubs used in this study contradict North American findings. Both clubs in this study embodied pro-dancer policies towards social control. While strip clubs throughout the world supply a similar service, the dancers in this study thought they were selling their nudity, not creating a fantasy. The sales technique most commonly used by dancers in this study to sell dances is ‘Do you want to see me naked?’ Their approach was in general brash, upfront and (arguably) more honest than the approaches reported in the North American literature...|$|R
40|$|In the {{discipline}} of archaeology death {{has always been a}} common subject. Graves and dead bodies in different states of decay are important sources of information. This dissertation investigates how our relation to death can be mirrored through some of the better-known individuals from prehistory in Scandinavia. Because of the character of the question at issue I start with three chapters in which I circle around the conception of death, of the individual as concept and of the museum in which the exposure of dead bodies take place. My aim here is to show how complex our attitudes towards death are in only one culture and one religion. Today our strategies involve a strong <b>intimacy</b> filled with <b>emotions</b> when we handle dead bodies, no matter whether they are prehistoric, historical or modern individuals. The individuals I have chosen for this study are the Bäckaskog woman, one of Sweden's oldest and best-preserved skeletons from the Stone Age, the Tollund man and the Grauballe man, two Danish bog bodies, and finally the Oseberg queen with her companion found in one of Norway's most precious ship graves. These dead bodies represent individual human beings once part of a prehistoric world, a world the archaeologists tries to understand. But they also belong to our modern society where exhibitions, media and other actions affect them in several ways from the day they are found. They have all in different ways developed from archaeological finds into dear and particular individuals, today known worldwide. Important in this work has been to elucidate them from as many angles as possible and to uncover the different layers of rhetoric in science and media, often intertwined in a subtle way. The prehistoric individual can function as an ideological and therapeutic tool in our time. In our bewildered situation, with a constant knowledge of the unavoidable death, they are immortal and forever fascinating, always belonging to two different worlds, visible and still enchantingly unreachable...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is not available}} through ChesterRepA growing literature on same-sex parenthood supports the argument that nonconventional forms of intimacy and care represent an opportunity to explore possible venues of resistance against macro-structural forces {{while at the same}} time avoiding marginalisation. My findings from a previous research on family care conducted in the US show that same-sex parents, by gaining social visibility, enriching and changing the possible definitions of family and parenthood, and challenging hegemonic sexualities, simultaneously distance themselves from homonormative definitions of family and marginalising definitions of cultural citizenship based on hegemonic heterosexuality. The theoretical framework of my research drew on those aspects of the sociology of emotions that, in explaining how feelings can reproduce social stratification, connect micro- and macro-levels, making <b>intimacy,</b> care and <b>emotion</b> central to understand how situated interactions reproduce social structure. Migrant LGBT people share many of the issues and concerns of heterosexual migrant people who are forced to live separated from their partners and/or families, but their experience can be made more complicated by their sexualities, biographies and histories. Their (private) stories and experiences are not only relevant to them, but also to the wider communities of migrant people and to their civil, legal, social and cultural rights. The right to visibility, the right to dignifying and dignified representation, the right to affirmation of identity, and the right to appreciation and valuing of differences also apply to many other forms of cultural citizenship currently denied. The relatively invisible experiences of LGBT transnational families may have therefore important implications in terms of social change and citizenship. Situating the debate of LGBT citizenship within the context of migration allows us to overcome misleading dualisms between marginalisation and incorporation and to look for anti-assimilationist strategies of inclusion. Thus, the nonviolent, micro-situated and emotion-based model of social change represented by these cultural entrepreneurs can perhaps be exported to other social groups, contexts and settings, creating the foundations for more caring, more just and more inclusive societies...|$|R
40|$|At {{some point}} in our lives, we have all {{experienced}} physical and emotional pain. We all also try to find meaning in such suffering, first within ourselves, but also through sharing these experiences {{with those who are}} close to us. In literature, authors who write autobiographies blur the boundaries between the public and private spheres when they invite readers into their personal world. Georges May and Philippe Lejeune, leading critics of the genre, have concluded that autobiographers not only try to make sense of their own lives, but through their writing, they also seek forgiveness and human compassion. My doctoral thesis explores how an important contemporary literary genre, the French autobiographical comic book (also known as the graphic novel), approaches the topic of health and disease and links it closely with questions of identity formation. Within the theoretical framework proposed by Laurent Berlant, who founded a now thriving branch of contemporary cultural studies known as “Intimacy Studies,” the central aim of my thesis is to demonstrate how these French graphic novels have become an important literary and cultural site for examining the social and artistic significance of a form of writing in which private health concerns are made public. In speaking of <b>intimacy,</b> <b>emotions</b> such as love and other kinds of interpersonal bonds typically come to mind. However, my study of a corpus of ten French-language autobiographical comic books indicates that health concerns and representations of a variety of physical, emotional and mental afflictions are topics of focus in this genre. Authors share their life stories and discuss their relationships with others, but they also share very personal details about their physical and mental states. This sort of intimacy is, I argue, a product of the medium itself. Comics are a hybrid genre in which written texts and images coexist. Comic artists who take their own lives as the subject of their art draw pictures of themselves over and over again. In the autobiographical comics I study, when illness and other afflictions strike the body, this suffering is rendered graphically on the page. These artists are also preoccupied by their inner lives. Both their writing and visual art allow them to portray the inner turmoil they endure in their private life. Comic book scholars, whose studies have proliferated over the past several decades, have largely overlooked how important the portrayal of health is {{in the development of the}} genre. This is somewhat surprising given the extent to which the underground graphic novelists who emerged in the United States in the 1960 s found ways to defy the Comic Code Authority by challenging cultural norms. These artists openly rejected the rules and conventions of mainstream comics, which typically focused on the exploits of super heroes or talking animals. Instead, they found artistic inspiration in their everyday lives and here is where politics and the art of expressing intimacy intersect. Underground comics were certainly infused with a spirit of rebellion, but the artists who participated in this movement sought first to reinvent the genre itself. Little by little, they delved into their inner lives and began to address some of the most taboo subjects of the day, including topics relating to the most personal aspects of their bodily existence. The daring these early underground comic writers showed in examining the unspoken aspects of personal life and relations went a long way toward establishing the genre as a recognized art form, opening the way for a subsequent generation of comic writers to tackle other serious topics such as war and genocide. Knowledge of the contributions that American underground artists had made to the comic book genre eventually reached Europe in the 1990 s. At the time, French artists were also growing tired of their own superhero story lines and disenchanted with the mass-production model that defined the Franco-Belgian comics industry. In response to these conditions, a small group of comic book artists formed a company called L’Association (The Association) which became the first independent comic book publishing house of its kind. They paved the way for many other such enterprises and their formula for success is now being replicated in the mainstream publishing houses these independent-minded artists fled several decades ago. Part of that formula is the inspiration these artists drew from American cartoonists who began in the 1960 s to share intimate aspects of their personal lives with their readership. What I have discovered thus far is the frequency with which French autobiographical comics take up and place the subject of ill health and life-threatening disease at the center of the stories they tell. Broaching the topic of ill health is not unique to the comics genre, but is rather a feature of modern autobiographical writing in general. As medical knowledge and scientific understanding have advanced in the modern era, the field of literature has worked to reclaim narratives from the medical world. But unlike other forms of literary expression, comic books offer more freedom of expression and possess a greater capacity to reflect the complexity of human identity and existence. This is especially the case with representations of human suffering. Images can configure what writing fails to grasp, allowing comic artists to express feelings and convey anguish that words can hardly express. The autobiographies I examine were produced by authors who have lived through, survived, or were in some way personally touched by a grave health crisis. Their use of the comic book genre allows them to make sense of the often life-shattering events they, or those who live in close proximity to them, have lived. I am particularly interested in the way in which these authors recount the crisis moment in their lives, how they understand the ways it affected them, and how they were able, or not, to recover from the experience. I show that our state of health, both physical or mental, has a profound effect on our identity, and how we perceive and tell stories about this dimension of our lives is crucial to forming a sense of self, particularly in a contemporary digitalized world that is now flooded with information and images once considered too private for public consumption. I demonstrate how the nine graphic autobiographies I have chosen to study are intimate expressions of vulnerable selfhood, showing how these public portraits of human weakness are a particularly postmodern way of reconstituting one’s identity in the social world. Modern and contemporary theories of human subjectivity teach us that the self is always fragmented. When we are sick, however, the task of finding a sense of stability in ourselves and in the world is even more daunting. Illness proves to be such a dominant theme in the comic book tradition, I argue, because it is a reminder of our own mortality. In the works I am studying, it is the experience of pain and the specter of death that often prompts the authors’ reflection on the self and on life. All of the works I am examining share a common feature. They exhibit a constant tension between the anxieties of revealing a deep personal vulnerability and the desire to make their suffering meaningful, which is a crucial aspect of these authors’ quest to recover and to reconstitute a sense of self in the aftermath of a debilitating illness. Informed by the insights of intimacy studies, psychoanalysis, comics studies and visual studies, I will show how the nine works I examine participate in the process of meaning-making and how the comics genre allows them to do so in particularly inventive and contemporary ways...|$|R
