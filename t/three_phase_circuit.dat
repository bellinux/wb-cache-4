30|$|An {{islanding}} {{detection method}} in ungrounded {{power distribution system}} based on single-phase operating mechanisms of the circuit breaker (CB) is proposed in this paper. When CB opens <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> <b>circuits</b> to form an island, one <b>phase</b> <b>circuit</b> is opened firstly {{and the other two}} <b>phase</b> <b>circuits</b> are opened secondly after certain duration. During the period when only one <b>phase</b> <b>circuit</b> is opened, negative sequence voltage with certain duration is obtained at DG side because of the asymmetric operation of the system. After all <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> <b>circuits</b> are opened, the voltage variation direction of the two phases that are secondly disconnected from the grid follows the voltage variation direction of the firstly disconnected phase. Based on the above voltage characteristics, an islanding detection scheme is proposed to identify genuine islanding from system disturbances. The performance of the proposed scheme is tested in PSCAD/EMTDC using a 10 kV distribution network with synchronous DG interconnection. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed method is effective and reliable to detect islanding formation.|$|R

30|$|The {{demand of}} {{electrical}} energy is ever increasing, {{as a rule}} of thumb it doubles every 10  years. In order to meet the growing power demand, power transfer capacity of the transmission lines is required to be enhanced continuously. The Right of Way (ROW) is the most remarkable challenge that the transmission sector is facing today. Thus, there is a need to enhance the power transfer capability of existing transmission corridor in an environmental friendly manner, rather than on constructing new transmission lines. In this regard, six phase transmission line was proposed by L.D Barthold and H.C. Barnes in 1972, as a potential alternative to cope up with ever increasing power demand, by transferring 73  % more power with efficient utilization of existing structure of <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> double <b>circuit</b> line (Stewart and Wilson 1978 a, b). Apart from enhanced power transfer capability, six phase transmission systems offer several other advantages over conventional <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> system such as: reduced conductor surface gradient, potentially lower audible noise levels and radio interference levels, better thermal loading capacity and surge impedance loading, lesser corona, good voltage regulation and higher efficiency, complete compatibility with existing <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> double <b>circuit</b> line and economic viability (Stewart and Wilson 1978 a, b; Stewart and Grant 1982; Stewart et al. 1984; Venkata et al. 1982 a, b). Inspite of the advantages of six phase transmission system, its low popularity is attributed to the absence of a reliable and efficient protection scheme.|$|R

30|$|Due to the {{involvement}} of larger number of conductors, the possibility of occurrence of faults in six phase transmission line is more as compared to <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> line. The total number of shunt faults that can occur in six phase system is 120, {{which is much more}} as compared to 22 in <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> double <b>circuit</b> and 11 in <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> single <b>circuit</b> transmission lines (Bhatt et al. 1977; Nanda et al. 1981; Venkata et al. 1982 a, b). The greater number of possible faults in six phase transmission line, demands the use of a relatively more complex, reliable and fast protection scheme. In this regard, limited protection techniques have been reported for protection of six phase lines in literature (Rebbapragada et al. 1992; Apostolov and George 1992; Apostolov and Raffensperger 1996; Oppel et al. 1998; Oppel and Krizauskas 1999; Redfern 1997; Hajjar and Mansour 2006; Hajjar and Mansour M 2007; Coury et al. 2002). Rebbapragada et al. reviewed the applicability of the commercially available digital protection scheme for the protection of six phase line in (Rebbapragada et al. 1992). Apostolov et al. analyzed the implementation of microprocessor based relays with programmable logic (designed for conventional three-phase systems) {{for the protection of the}} six phase test line in (Apostolov and George 1992; Apostolov and Raffensperger 1996). These techniques use voltage and current signals at both ends and thus require a complicated communication channel, which affects the reliability and cost of the protection schemes. A step distance scheme utilizing <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> relays as backup protection has been described in (Oppel et al. 1998). However, the scheme was able to detect only 83  % of the simulated faults cases. Also, for fault cases involving adjacent phases with fault impedance 20  Ω or greater, it’s response was not proper. The performance of a protection scheme developed for six phase test line has been analyzed in (Oppel and Krizauskas 1999). A non unit distance protection scheme for various fault conditions has been addressed by Redfern (1997). A microprocessor and wavelet based relaying approach for detection and classification of shunt faults have been reported in (Hajjar and Mansour 2006).
