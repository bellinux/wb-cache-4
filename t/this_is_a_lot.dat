50|$|The {{effectiveness}} can {{be viewed}} in two different ways. As the years have gone on, the tax payments only increased into substantial amounts. According to USA Today Sports, more and more teams have come close or surpassed the tax threshold in the recent years, as salaries have inflated especially {{in the past few}} offseasons, despite owners wanting to stay below the tax threshold. Despite “the big spenders trying to spend less,” they are not trying hard enough. This is shown as certain media outlets believe that the luxury tax is not changing the mindset of owners truly. However, in 2015, it was teams {{in the middle of the}} payroll pack winning playoff games, as well as the World Series, as none of the teams that went over the tax threshold won a playoff game. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> different from the Atlanta Braves and New York Yankees dynasties in the 1990s. Despite the success in 2015, the effectiveness could be an outlier. According to fivethirtyeight’s Noah Davis and Michael Lopez, despite of the new system, cash buys more wins now than they did in the past. They also state that it is a case by case basis, as some teams win less when they spend more, proving there is no true answer to the effectiveness of the tax.|$|E
5000|$|An {{effective}} approach shape can {{be derived}} from physics. For example, the rate of backward spin required as the jumper crosses the bar to facilitate shoulder clearance on the way up and foot clearance on the way down can be determined by computer simulation. This rotation rate can be back-calculated to determine the required angle of lean away from the bar at plant, based on how long the jumper is on the take-off foot. This information, together with the jumper's speed in the curve, can be used to calculate the radius of the curved part of the approach. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of work and requires measurements of running speed and time of take-off foot on the ground. However, one can work in the opposite direction by assuming an approach radius and watching the resulting backward rotation. This only works if some basic rules are followed in how one executes the approach and take-off. [...] Drills can be practiced to solidify the approach. One drill is to run in a straight line (the linear part of the approach) and then run two to three circles spiraling into one another. Another is to run or skip a circle of any size, two to three times in a row. It is important to train to leap upwards without first leaning into the bar, allowing the momentum of the J approach to carry the body across the bar.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the TV series received an average score of 74, based on 13 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". The Wall Street Journals Dorothy Rabinowitz explained Awkward is a [...] "series about a high-school girl that's neither maudlin nor alarming nor conceived with intent to preach or to shock. It's further distinguished by its focus on entirely recognizable teenage pains, as endured by an entirely recognizable teenager, Jenna (Ashley Rickards). Its other distinction: strong echoes of an older kind of storytelling, the sort whose characters grow and acquire depth. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to expect these days from TV writing of any kind, much less a series about teenagers—it's relief enough when it's not about vampires." [...] Hank Stuever of The Washington Post found that series [...] "funny", which was [...] "a pleasant surprise from MTV, the maker of so many lame teen comedies that I've lost count." [...] The New York Times called Awkward as [...] "a wry show about longing—for love, certainly, but also for consistency, that great intangible in the ever-morphing world of high school life". John Kubicek of BuddyTV website wrote [...] "Just like Easy A, Mean Girls or other strong, female-centric teen comedies, Awkward has a quick wit and a very distinct vision of the world. It's the perfect blend of comedy and painful teenage awkwardness, and in the end, the title says it all." [...] He concluded [...] "The result {{is one of the}} most enjoyable and earnest teen comedies TV has produced". Writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, David Wiegand described the show as [...] "a very smart mix of realism and satirical exaggeration" [...] and praised the writing for being sharp.

[...] He also reserved praise for [...] "Russell Boyd's splendid cinematography and Rick Lazzarini's convincing animatronics." [...] Film critic Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film a thumbs down review gruffly calling it, [...] "preposterous" [...] and saying [...] "I'm not buying it all the way through." [...] He also ridiculed the outdoor market scene as [...] "the world's most dangerous profession in the movies; selling fruit on a city street." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum writing for Entertainment Weekly gave the film a positive [...] "B Grade" [...] rating and viewed the film as a [...] "concept, supposedly based on a true story, is weird — this is what Vietnam movies have come to? But at least the Disney quadruped has the grace to say nothing, and Leary, still an interesting motormouth, knows enough not to smoke or swear when there are elephants around." [...] Peter Stack writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, saw the film as [...] "not the terrible movie that its ubiquitous trailers would indicate. But it is an odd one," [...] and that [...] "Glover and Liotta, though not exactly great comic actors, play off each other with real spark, the two vying for command of the outlandish mission to deliver the elephant across 200 miles of impossible jungle terrain to the mountain village." ...|$|E
