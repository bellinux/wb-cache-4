40|$|The {{presentation}} {{is divided into}} two parts. In Part I we introduce a primal-dual path-following interior point method for positive semidefinite programming based on the linearization of ZX Γ¯I. This linearization leads to unsymmetric updates for X but by using the symmetric part of only, convergence can be guaranteed. The algorithm is well suited for the predictor-corrector approach proposed by Mehrotra [48] and is very efficient in practice. In Part II we employ the code from Part I for computing upper bounds for the max-cut problem. In particular we combine the eigenvalue upper bound based on the maximal eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the graph with the polyhedral upper bound delivered by <b>triangle</b> <b>inequalities.</b> We also investigate the effect of larger clique inequalities.

25|$|Ignoring {{mathematical}} details, for {{any system}} of roads and terrains {{the distance between}} two locations {{can be defined as}} the length of the shortest route connecting those locations. To be a metric there shouldn't be any one-way roads. The <b>triangle</b> <b>inequality</b> expresses the fact that detours aren't shortcuts. If the distance between two points is zero, the two points are indistinguishable from one-another. Many of the examples below can be seen as concrete versions of this general idea.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the general}} TSP, Euclidean TSP is NP-hard in either case. With {{rational}} coordinates and discretized metric (distances rounded {{up to an}} integer), the problem is NP-complete. With rational coordinates and the actual Euclidean metric, Euclidean TSP {{is known to be}} in the Counting Hierarchy, a subclass of PSPACE. With arbitrary real coordinates, Euclidean TSP cannot be in such classes, since there are uncountably many possible inputs. However, Euclidean TSP is probably the easiest version for approximation. For example, the minimum spanning tree of the graph associated with an instance of the Euclidean TSP is a Euclidean minimum spanning tree, and so can be computed in expected O (n log n) time for n points (considerably less than the number of edges). This enables the simple 2-approximation algorithm for TSP with <b>triangle</b> <b>inequality</b> above to operate more quickly.|$|E
