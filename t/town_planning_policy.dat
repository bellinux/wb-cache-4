Modern cities are faced with urban and environmental challenges and the major question faced by practitioners trying to plan environmentally friendly development is: {{what can be done}} in planning practice to address the identified challenges? Conventional buildings consume huge amounts of construction material, use a lot of portable water, use energy and emit a lot of green house gases during operation which contributes to climate change. Green building is considered as a means of addressing some of the environmental challenges associated with conventional buildings. The study follows both a qualitative and quantitative approaches to collect data to establish whether GB is practiced in Gaborone and if not what barriers exist. It is established that people in the property development sector in Gaborone are aware of the need to practice GB. However, planning authorities and policy makers are not supportive GB initiatives. Green Buildings have a higher initial construction cost but they also attract higher rental turnover and a high value. This study concludes that an incorporation of Green Building concepts into <b>Town</b> <b>Planning</b> <b>policy</b> and practice can provide meaningful contribution towards safer, more comfortable and sustainable environment for urban communities...|$|E
40|$|The idea of {{balanced}} social mix, {{or creating}} communities with {{a blend of}} residents from different housing tenures and income levels, is of common concern for contemporary housing and planning policies in Australia, the UK and the US. In Australia, the state based Shelter organisations have run several workshops about the issue and in the UK the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has recently released a consultation paper on ‘Planning for Mixed Communities’ (ODPM 2005). Internationally, social mix and the related issue of neighbourhood effects {{have been the subject}} of much debate, which is reflected in the flurry of articles and special editions of major international journals, including ‘Housing Studies’ (Vol 17, 1 & Vol 18, 6) and ‘Urban Studies’ (Vol 38, 12). This interest is by no means new as the concept of ‘social mix’ has informed Australian, British and US new <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>policy</b> since the post second world war years. In general, this model of town planning anticipates benefits for disadvantaged residents of coexisting with homeowners and working residents, in balanced heterogenous communities. However, the importance placed on social mix has waxed and waned over time and the policy goals, expectations and meanings and values embedded in the concept of social mix have also varied. During the 1970 s in Australia, for instance, the concept was tied to addressing poverty and achieving redistributive ideals and equity in the distribution of government resources and as a reaction against the development of mass public housing projects. At that time, social mix was thought to achieve better access to services for disadvantaged residents and also to build more stable communities...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} town settlement in the Cherokee Nation within the contexts of changing town settlement policies and regional development processes between 1866 and 1907. This includes {{an analysis of the}} development and implementation of townsite settlement policies by both the Cherokee Nation and the United States during their separate periods of townsite planning in the study area. ^ The method of explanation used in this empirical study is the construction of an historical geographical narrative. Descriptive statistics and cartographic analysis are utilized in a temporal framework and support traditional historical archival research. A methodological contribution is made to the study of initial agglomerated settlement change at the regional scale of analysis. ^ After the Civil War, the Cherokee Nation developed a <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>policy</b> that allowed non-Cherokees to establish towns within their domain. By allowing Cherokee citizens to purchase use rights to town lots and lease them to noncitizens, this policy gave Cherokees a financial stake in the economic development of urban centers along railroads built through their land. The Cherokees 2 ̆ 7 policy, although modeled after railroad town planning strategies, confronted quite different problems that reveal the basic spatial contradictions of Indian sovereignty within the U. S. federal system. Nevertheless, the present urban pattern of the study area was established under Cherokee authority. ^ In the 1890 s, town growth in the Cherokee Nation and Indian Territory generally drove Congress to unilaterally initiate allotment in severalty among the Five Civilized Tribes. In the Cherokee Nation, the federal government allowed white town settlers to purchase the lots they occupied, and otherwise legitimized the rights of white squatters in towns. The federal plan to alienate townsites was poorly implemented due to budget shortfalls, which resulted in widespread townsite speculation several years prior to Oklahoma statehood. ...|$|E

Be it  town planning, municipal administration, work for a  non-governmental organization Union of Architects  of Russia, or creating a journal. The headwater area has always been and remains  the best residential area ever built in recent history  of Irkutsk. Irkutsk has never seen such a clever and honest  chief architect. He has done so much to develop the  city in the right and progressive direction and to  promote high quality architecture. Andrei Bokov’s words can be related to Vladimir  Bukh’s activity: “Everything that excites a fair and  natural envy, the best examples of the second heroic  epoch of the Russian-Soviet architecture, belong  to Irkutsk architecture of the 1970 s: orientation  towards the future (but not the past), bigness of  volumes and ideas, restraint, strictness, honesty,  courage, persistency and strength. Irkutsk experience… was accumulated by young  people, who were energetic, ambitious, lucky, captivating,  talented and highly professional. ” For several decades Bukh {{was a member of the}} Board  of the Irkutsk organization of the Union of  Architects of the USSR and then of Russia. The  expression “to work with feeling” can be fully  applied to Bukh. To do your job the right way. To do  it according to your conscience. When he quitted  the Board after demolition of the House on the  Legs, it became clear that he was indispensable.   He took to heart all town planning mistakes of the  1990 s and 2000 s. Pavlov’s death, demolition of the  House on the Legs, legal proceedings, Nina’s death  left scars on his heart. His daughter Lesya, grandchildren Nikita and  Nastya, and great grandson Matvey are continuation  of his life. All we, his colleagues and friends, can do  is try to keep to his understanding of what is right  and what is wrong. And to keep memory of a wonderful  man. I do not know how long Project Baikal will exist  (Bukh is one of the founders, the first and the best  editor-in-chief), but all our further issues will be  dedicated to him.

40|$|Green {{infrastructure}} (GI) emphasizes identifying, conserving {{and managing}} interconnected ecological networks {{enabling them to}} deliver benefits both to the ecosystem and the community. The characteristics of GI are cross land boundaries, multifunctional landscape, connectivity among habitats cores and delivering of various ecological services. GI plan outlines existing natural and cultural assets which become blue print of GI infrastructure project and guidance to future development. Village housing development and nature conservation have been under enormous tensions. Local villages embrace distinct semi-natural habitats such as Fung Shui wood, wetlands and fish ponds. However, these habitats have been under threat from soaring demand for Small Houses (SH). SH applications received by government have increased from 876 in 2005 to 1, 662 in 2010 (Lao, 2013). Using conventional conservation tools such as designating sites as Country Parks and Site of Special Scientific Sites has been unsuccessful due to deprecation from villagers and complicated land uses and indistinct ownership found with local villagers. Current village development policies have not catered for any needs of conservation whereas only two successful cases under New Nature Conservation Policies were identified {{in the past ten}} years. A village planning strategy which integrates development with conservation without sacrificing the integrity of ecosystem is needed. The research methods encompass a questionnaire and overseas policies case study. The target groups were villagers, village visitors and planning and building professionals. The case studies focused on policy and financial instruments adopted by European Commission, the UK and the USA in promoting GI in their regions. Total 102 questionnaires were analysed and most respondents were supportive of adopting GI as conservation and planning tool of villages. Highest number of respondents selected nature conservation as preferable land uses in villages. Most respondents were in favour of GI that creates better connection to nature and enhance biodiversity in the village. They mostly preferred to support GI by visiting GI demonstration projects and agreed that GI should be financially supported by Government regular spending. The case studies showed that there were various level of GI related policy instruments from transnational policies, national legislations, non-binding guidelines, and financial incentives in promoting GI across the countries. The UK example depicted that delegation of authority in <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>policy</b> from central government to district levels would lift the progression of GI plan making at community level. It is suggested that policy actions should within the scope as defined here: 1) Exploring opportunities for integration of GI in existing policies. 2) Building social capacity and increasing public awareness of GI. 3) Improving information and promoting innovation. GI is a fresh concept to Hong Kong.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the period bridging the era of extreme housing shortages in Stockholm {{on the eve of}} industrialisation and the much admired programmes of housing provision that followed after the second world war, when Stockholm district Vällingby became an example for underground railway-serviced ”new towns”. It is argued that important changes were made in the housing and <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>policy</b> in Stockholm in this period that {{paved the way for the}} successful ensuing period. Foremost among these changes was the uniquely developed practice of municipal leaseholding with the help of site leasehold rights (Erbbaurecht). The study is informed by recent developments in Foucauldian social research, which go under the heading ’governmentality’. Developments within urban planning are understood as different solutions to the problem of urban order. To a large extent, urban and housing policies changed during the period from direct interventions into the lives of inhabitants connected to a liberal understanding of housing provision, to the building of a disciplinary city, and the conduct of ’governmental’ power, building on increased activity on behalf of the local state to provide housing and the integration and co-operation of large collectives. Municipal leaseholding was a fundamental means for the implementation of this policy. When the new policies were introduced, they were limited to the outer parts of the city and administered by special administrative bodies. This administrative and spatial separation was largely upheld throughout the period, and represented as the parallel building of a ’social’ outer city, while things in the inner ’mercantile’ city proceeded more or less as before. This separation was founded in a radical difference in land holding policy: while sites in the inner city were privatised and sold at market values, land in the outer city was mostly leasehold land, distributed according to administrative – and thus politically decided – priorities. These differences were also understood and acknowledged by the inhabitants. Thorough studies of the local press and the organisational life of the southern parts of the outer city reveals that the local identity was tightly connected with the representations connected to the different land holding systems. Inhabitants in the south-western parts of the city, which in this period was still largely built on private sites, displayed a spatial understanding built on the contradictions between centre and periphery. The inhabitants living on leaseholding sites, however, showed a clear understanding of their position as members of model communities, tightly connected to the policy of the municipal administration. The organisations on leaseholding sites also displayed a deep co-operation with the administration. As the analyses of election results show, the inhabitants also seemed to have felt a greater degree of integration with the society at large, than people living in other parts of the city. The leaseholding system in Stockholm has persisted until today and has been one of the strongest in the world, although the local neo-liberal politicians are currently disposing it off...|$|E

In 2000 the European Landscape Convention established the necessity ‘to integrate landscape into its regional and <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>policies</b> and in its cultural, environmental, agricultural, social and economic policies’. Such articulated territorial dimension requires an approach able to consider multi-dimensional data and information from different spatial and temporal series, supporting territorial analysis and spatial planning under different points of view. Most {{of landscape}} representation instruments are based on 3 D models based on top-down image/views, with still weak possibilities to reproduce views similar to the human eye or map surface development along preferential directions (e. g. water front views). A methodological approach of rediscovering the long tradition of historical water front view maps, itinerary maps and human eye maps perspective, could improve content decoding of cultural heritage with environmental dimension and its knowledge transfer to planners and citizens.
