40|$|European State aid {{law allows}} Member States to {{compensate}} selected {{companies that are}} entrusted with the operation of Services of General Economic Interest ("SGEI"). Overcompensation - compensation that exceeds {{what is necessary to}} cover {{all or part of the}} cost of <b>the</b> <b>SGEI</b> including a reasonable profit - is prohibited. The application of the prohibition to ex post overcompensation leads to altered risk for companies entrusted with <b>the</b> operation of <b>SGEI</b> and to weakened incentives for an efficient operation of <b>the</b> <b>SGEI.</b> This can either result in a failure of public procurement procedures for <b>the</b> <b>SGEI,</b> or, ironically, in overcompensation. The prohibition of ex ante overcompensation sets incentives right and is therefore preferable...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission has {{produced}} precise rules governing the computation {{of the cost}} of services of general economic interest (<b>SGEI).</b> <b>The</b> Commission has adopted a fully distributed cost approach where <b>the</b> <b>SGEI</b> can bear a "reasonable" share of the common cost. We highlight a possible inconsistency issue between this state aid case law and the antitrust case law based on an incremental cost approach. We also show the difficulty introduced by the identification of the common costs, relying on the example of the network of a postal operator providing commercial services and fulfilling an accessibility obligation. ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{examines}} {{the decisions of the}} State aid monitoring authorities established during the last decade in the EU candidate countries in South-East European (SEE) in the field of services of general economic interest (SGEI). SEE countries have traditionally heavily subsidized providers of SGEI operating in a number of industries (e. g. postal sector, public transports, public broadcasting, water and energy supply). The article compares the national State aid decisions with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and the Decisions and the soft law adopted by the EU Commission in <b>the</b> area of <b>SGEI.</b> <b>The</b> article concludes that <b>the</b> <b>SGEI</b> acquis has either being 'neglected" or 'misapplied" by SEE monitoring authorities. The European Commission should thus not simply check whether EU candidate countries transpose the relevant State aid legislation and established a monitoring authority; it should also assess whether the local institutions enforce "correctly" the EU State aid acquis during the pre-accession phase...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of Public Service Obligations (PSO) {{in the network}} sectors of SGEIs are defined by the normative values of a good administrative protocol with sectoral rules set out in EU legislation. The Europeanisation of these sectors provides a coherent base which informs the national approaches in providing for acts of entrustment {{and the establishment of}} independent national regulatory agencies. This paper examines the development of this model and provides a comparison with the approach taken in economic social services sectors where Member States face a developing imperative to designate essential SSGI as SGEI. This is a social services environment in which a growing Public Service Industry is increasingly seeing private sector economic actors enjoy a general advantage over third sector not-for-profit and charity entities, in the public procurement processes. The comparison highlights the significant differences in the way that PSOs are expressed between <b>the</b> network <b>SGEIs</b> and <b>the</b> ‘social’ <b>SGEIs</b> and raises a question of whether it is time to consider, in at least some social services sectors, whether the {{expression of}} PSOs should be re-modelled {{in such a way as}} to replicate those in <b>the</b> network <b>SGEI</b> sectors...|$|R
40|$|Services of General Interest (<b>SGEI)</b> are, in <b>the</b> {{wording of}} the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), among the ‘shared values of the Union’ and play an {{important}} role in ‘promoting social and territorial cohesion’. These services cover a wide range of activities and utilities ranging from water supply and ambulance services to the setting up of telecommunication infrastructures. Their role in the development of certain regions or in the inclusion of certain social categories has been acknowledged in numerous Commission documents and courts’ rulings. <b>The</b> financing of <b>SGEI</b> is in principle allowed, if this is necessary in order to ensure the proper functioning of the markets for the benefit of the consumers. For Member States <b>the</b> financing of <b>SGEI</b> is a means of achieving the social and cohesion objectives set up in their constitutions. However, for the European Union (EU), this financing may constitute a distortion of the competition between Member States and is subject to close scrutiny. This terrain is therefore a field in which the clear definition of the services and national interests concerned and the delimitation between national and EU competences is of crucial importance. In several different contexts the Europe 2020 Commission strategy mentions social cohesion as an objective which needs to be reached by the EU in the next decade. However, in none of these contexts are <b>the</b> <b>SGEI</b> mentioned, although these services are instrumental in that respect. What does this silence mean? What are the implications of the 2020 strategy on the definition and financing of SGEI? Are there any consequences for the current and future regulatory framework of SGEI...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} fulfil the European Union’s {{renewable}} energy policy and its multiple objectives, the Member States of the Union have introduced national support schemes for renewable electricity. These support schemes are not harmonized, {{but they need}} to be carefully designed and comply with various aspects of EU law. This includes state aid concerns. Instead of following the Commission’s Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy 2014 - 2020, which today guide the Member States’ support scheme design to quite a large extent, this thesis proposes an alternative way for Member States to comply with state aid law when support schemes for renewable electricity are designed. The aim {{of this study is to}} clarify whether schemes for the promotion of renewable electricity could potentially, as EU law stands today, be classified as services in the general economic interest (SGEI), and to clarify potential difficulties that a support scheme for renewable electricity would face in relation to material compatibility with EU law if it was classified as an <b>SGEI.</b> <b>The</b> idea of qualifying a support scheme for renewable electricity as an <b>SGEI</b> rests on <b>the</b> thought that the production of renewable energy might be viewed as a service of general or public interest. The objectives of a renewable energy support scheme, and especially the environmental objective of climate change mitigation, could be seen as general or public interest objectives. While producing renewable energy, the energy producers might then be conceived as providing a service in the general interest, and the support that the producer receives under the support scheme would be seen as compensation for the service provided. An analysis of <b>the</b> position of <b>SGEI</b> under EU law, and an attempt to give a general <b>definition</b> of <b>SGEI</b> including some limits to this definition is made. Simultaneously, the possibility to fit support schemes for renewable electricity into the definition is analysed. The possibility to include renewable electricity in <b>the</b> concept of <b>SGEI</b> is thereafter gradually analysed by reviewing environmental <b>SGEIs,</b> <b>the</b> position of public service obligations in the Electricity Directive, and existing Union soft and case law dealing with the possibility to define a support scheme for renewable energy as an <b>SGEI.</b> <b>The</b> study shows that the possibility to introduce a support scheme for renewable electricity as an SGEI finds support in EU law, but the factual possibility to introduce a support scheme for renewable energy as an SGEI is circumscribed by quite a few restrictions and established SGEI characteristics...|$|R

40|$|New Public Management (“NPM”) is {{a reform}} {{movement}} {{with the intent}} of increasing efficiency in the public sector. NPM reforms have had a great impact on organization of the public sectors in the EU Member States during the last 25 years. There has been considerable research done from a political science and economics point of view into the subject. The concept of public services in EU law is closely related to the legal concept of services of general economic interest (“SGEI”) which is mentioned in the treaties. The 2003 Altmark ruling and the 2009 BUPA ruling have shaped the way Member States finance SGEI. This thesis sets out to research the relationship between New Public Management and public services in a Union law context in <b>the</b> form of <b>SGEI.</b> One of <b>the</b> underlying questions is whether NPM ideas have affected the legal concept of SGEI. This thesis reviews the literature on the origins of, ideological background on and policy suggestions of the NPM movement. In turning to the law this thesis focuses on the treatment of public services in EU law, the legal basis of SGEI as well as the pre-Altmark case law regarding the application of Article 106 (2) TFEU. In turning to <b>the</b> financing of <b>SGEI</b> <b>the</b> thesis reviews the Altmark and BUPA cases as well as other relevant and more recent cases. By using the information obtained from a review of literature on NPM this thesis analysis the relationship between NPM and <b>SGEI.</b> <b>The</b> main findings are that marketization reforms undertaken in EU Member States, such as privatization and liberalization, especially in such areas as health care, have opened up previously more “guarded” national competence areas to the scope of Union competition law. This situation has forced the courts to increasingly deal with concepts of non-market values in competition law and a specific area of law is beginning to form. The dismantling of monopolies through liberalization has also lead to a shift in from the use of Article 102 to the use of Article 107 when challenging state supported undertakings. Additionally, some of the criticism aimed at NPM regarding its compatibility with so called public service values, can be noticed in the legal debate, albeit within a legal context. Arguably NPM has had a great impact on shaping the environment in which EU law operates...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the criticisms}} against the new rules {{applicable}} to the granting of State aid to finance the provision of services of general economic interest (<b>SGEI)</b> in <b>the</b> ‘Almunia package’ is that enforcement {{is likely to be}} their weakest point. Similarly, in the more general setting of the ‘private’ enforcement of State aid rules, the 2006 Study on the Enforcement of State Aid Law at National Level recommended that the European Commission create a common minimum standard of remedies applicable in all EU jurisdictions, stressing that ‘one possible means of creating such a standard would be to adopt a remedies directive for State aid cases, which could be modelled on the remedies directive for procurement cases’. Building upon these considerations, {{the extent to which the}} existing remedies within the system for the enforcement of EU public procurement rules provide an effective platform to enforce EU State aid rules, particularly those for <b>the</b> financing of <b>SGEI,</b> before public procurement review bodies and courts is assessed. The paper describes the main groups of cases where public procurement litigation ‘phagocytises’ State aid considerations. It then proceeds to explore the viability, from an EU law perspective, of configuring public procurement review bodies and courts as ‘State aid courts’ for the purposes of the simultaneous enforcement of both sets of rules in a single setting of ‘private’ litigation. It also submits that using the public procurement system in this way provides effective remedies for the enforcement of the Almunia Package for <b>the</b> financing of <b>SGEI,</b> and adds consistency in terms of harmonisation of the material rules to be applied.

40|$|Public {{infrastructure}} services (or Services of General Economic Interest, <b>SGEI)</b> in <b>the</b> European Union have undergone significant {{reform in the}} recent period, including privatization, liberalization and deregulation. These reforms, however, have led to concerns about {{the potential impact of}} pursuing economic profitability over service quality, affordability, accessibility and universality. Traditionally, because SGEI have been understood as playing a key economic, social and strategic role, they have been subject to specific rules in the general interest: so-called Public Service Obligations (PSO). A key objective of PSO is to ensure equal access to services, independent of the place of residence, income or other factors. PSO are, therefore, a key instrument as regards ensuring equity and territorial cohesion. As such, it constitutes a fundamental concern in European regional policy. Traditionally, <b>the</b> regulation of <b>SGEI</b> has focused on the supply side, as it has been assumed competition in an integrated European market would benefit citizens. Despite this, little research has actually been done on evaluating regulation from the demand side, not to speak of applying a regional focus. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate SGEI provision and regulation in the EU from the perspective of citizens as consumers using a regional perspective. We focus on the region (NUTS 1) and the urban/rural character of the place of residence as possible determinants of disparities. To do so, a microeconometric analysis of citizens' revealed and stated preferences is performed, focusing on three large European countries (Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) for four services: electricity, gas, water and telecommunications. First, disparities in spending on the services are analyzed, using National Household Budget Surveys. Next, differences in dissatisfaction with service access and price are analyzed, using the Eurobarometer. Finally, we analyze whether lower consumption of a particular service in a particular region or rural area is related to problems of accessibility, affordability or to other factors. Findings show different regional patterns of services use. Moreover, serious and widespread problems are observed regarding equal access to services such as gas and telecommunications in rural areas, of some concern for the question of territorial cohesion...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} issue underlying {{this essay is}} {{the tension between the}} EU’s aims of market integration on the one hand, and, on the other, the intervention of Member States in the economy and welfare provision and the exercise of public functions by national authorities in sensitive industrial sectors. In this respect I have focused on one specific aspect: the CJEU’s case law on the special powers held by the State in formerly public companies where the rights conferred on shareholders by ordinary law are reduced for the benefit of public entities. Besides European golden shares, my contribution had dealt with the access to the EU’s market of non-EU public/private hybrids, namely sovereign investors such as sovereign wealth funds (“SWFs”) and state owned enterprises (“SOEs”). The first aim of my research is to investigate in what sense, to what extent and for what reasons the golden shares jurisprudence represents a privileged – although atypical – sedes materiae to illustrate the content and extent of EU economic/market integration, the connection between the latter and the two interrelated concepts of social integration and EU solidarity, and the impact of such dual integration (both economic and social) on Member States’ solidarity. In this regard, three main questions arise: has the CJEU been too activist in condemning Member States with regard to privat(is) e(d) undertakings, or is its approach justified {{in the light of the}} EU’s free market objectives? Is the up-to-date case law likely to endanger the solidarity on which <b>the</b> provision of <b>SGEIs</b> is grounded? Is the scope of manoeuvre currently accorded to Member States too narrow to justify national socio-economic policies on golden shares under the free movement rules (especially, as will be seen further on, from the point of view of the exceptions to these rules) ?. My second general aim is to identify the main concerns raised by the access of SWFs and SOEs to the EU market and, then, to assess whether action by the EU is welcome and necessary in this area. In this respect, the main questions are: is it conceivable a European golden share to restrict this kind of investments to be shaped on the basis of a European notion of solidarity? Should the CJEU be proactive and, for instance, admit ‘new’ Cassis-Gebhard overriding reasons of general interest that could not be admitted vis-à-vis intra-EU investments? Could the derogation provided for in Art. 65. 1 b) allow for a restriction that is compatible with EU law? And in that case, what kind of connection would there be between national and European solidarity...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{focused on}} {{the application of the}} principle of horizontal subsidiarity and management of local public services. The thesis has developed two parallel lines: the study of the principle of subsidiarity and the analysis of the regulation of local public services. First I studied the legal term of “principle of subsidiarity”. I analyzed the development of this principle in history, from its first use - the lexical formulation finds its historical origin in 1931, by the Encyclical of Pius XI, Quadragesimo Anno - until the positivistic codification given by the Italian Constitution. Subsequently I {{focused on the}} first legal references of the concept of horizontal subsidiarity and the work of the Constituent Assembly; then I analyzed the interpretation given by doctrine and jurisprudence about the concept and application of the principle of horizontal subsidiarity; in particular, the study addressed the pronunciations of the administrative courts. I proceeded to analyze the article 118 of the Constitution as a legal instrument-constitutional need for a more effective application of the principle of horizontal subsidiarity in the regulation of local public services. The principle of subsidiarity, in fact, is textual mentioned in the Italian Constitution in Articles 118, paragraph 1 and 4, and 120, paragraph 2; while Articles 118, paragraph 1, and 120, paragraph 2 of the Constitution, refer the principle of subsidiarity in vertical sense, the last paragraph of 118, concerns properly the horizontal profile of the principle, providing that “the State, regions, metropolitan cities, provinces and municipalities shall promote the autonomous initiatives of citizens, individually and in combination, for the performance of activities of general interest, based on the principle subsidiarity”. The search come {{to the study of the}} judgments of the Constitutional Court, which has deepened as the Court has never faced explicitly the interpretation of paragraph 4 of Art. 118 of the Constitution in connection with the regulation of local public services, and that the sentence no. 24 / 2011, acknowledging the legitimacy of the referendum to repeal art. 23 bis of Legislative Decree no. 112 / 2008, has said that, if it were repealed that provision “would follow the immediate application of Community legislation in the Italian” regarding local public services. The first part of the thesis concluded with a chapter on comparative law of the German Lander on the subject of subsidiarity cd reinforced. Important was the deepening of the judgment of the Constitutional Court of Rhineland-Palatinate (RhPhVerGH 28. 3. 2000), in which, by stating that the aim pursued by the legislature of the Land is based on an objective and fair assessment of public, has been ruled unconstitutional a provision of subsidiarity that has. The second part of the doctoral thesis had an incipit deepening the concept of local public service and its historical evolution. Second, the research has focused on the regulation of the management of local public services as developed in recent years (only in the last three years there was a continuous modification of the discipline). In the seventh chapter, the research has focused, in particular, on two different perspectives to identify the discipline of local public services: a) the analysis of the articles of the Italian, not touched the declaration of unconstitutionality by Constitutional Court no. 199 / 2012; b) the law of local public services (or rather Services of General Economic Interest - <b>SGEI).</b> <b>The</b> last part of the thesis has sought to synthesize than previously analyzed in order to bring together and provide a clear and comprehensive view of the argument: a sustainable interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity to the discipline of local public services...|$|R
