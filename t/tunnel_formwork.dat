5000|$|The {{formwork}} products, {{systems and}} design service include formwork panels, slab formwork, wall formwork, one-sided wall formwork, climbing formwork, <b>tunnel</b> <b>formwork,</b> dam formwork, bridge formwork (cast-in-place balanced cantilever bridge, concrete arch bridge and steel combination bridge formwork), shoring / falsework, tie systems and field support, software and training. Doka’s business {{is based on}} a combination of production, equipment sale & rental, engineering and maintenance. Most of the formwork production takes place at the Group’s central plant in Amstetten. [...] The Doka three-ply sheets are made in the branch plant in Banská Bystrica in Slovakia.|$|E
40|$|Houses are spaces {{where we}} {{spend most of}} our lives, meeting our {{accommodation}} needs and reflecting us and our personality. The <b>tunnel</b> <b>formwork</b> systems are effective in house production. They appeal {{to the people in}} different social status varying from high-incomers to low-incomers from the city center to the peripheries of city. Based on such determination, the satisfaction of house user set forth the main line of work. For this purpose, six parameters have been ascertained to determine the user’s comfort, by interrogating the comfort of interior space in the houses: The thermal comfort, visual comfort, acoustic comfort, humidity and moisture control and design quality. With the purpose of interrogating the user’s satisfaction, four mass housing areas constructed with <b>tunnel</b> <b>formwork</b> system in İzmir hav...|$|E
40|$|To {{systematically}} {{study the}} mechanical properties and structural {{responses of the}} secondary lining for high-speed railway tunnels excavated in loess ground, on-site monitoring was performed to measure the contact pressure between the primary lining and secondary lining. It is found that the contact pressure reaches its first peak value when the <b>tunnel</b> <b>formwork</b> carriage is removed. The load acting on secondary lining {{is in the form}} of deformation pressure, which is different from the loose pressure prescribed in the China Tunnel Design Standard. The results obtained from this study enhance our understanding towards the mechanical characteristics of secondary lining for high-speed railway tunnels and are also beneficial to secondary lining design. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
5000|$|Work {{commenced}} on 25 January 1932 using subsidised labour from a work relief {{scheme to}} find employment for those {{affected by the}} economic depression. [...] A workers camp was erected; flat land was cleared around the portal on which buildings were erected for the workshop and powerhouse. Plant included an electric motor for running air compressors, ventilation, and the equipment used to apply the concrete lining to the completed <b>tunnel</b> walls. <b>Formwork</b> for the <b>tunnel</b> portal was assembled and the hillside prepared for {{the building of the}} portal. Additional men were due to start work at the site after 1 February.|$|R
40|$|The La Mina {{district}} {{is a public}} housing development. Consisting of 2727 apartments which were built during the years 1968 - 74 {{at the height of}} the building sector boom, it is characterized by the mixture of building types and building methods employed and is remarkable for the use of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>formwork</b> technique. This paper presents and discusses the contents of the technical study which was prepared as a part of the Plan for Transformation and Improvement of the neighbourhood. The Plan provides for the rehabilitation of buildings and the urban reclassification and social regeneration of the neighbourhood, which is highly stigmatized as a problem area. The functional and structural safety conditions, the level of thermal and acoustic insulation, fire protection, accessibility and maintenance conditions were all analysed in detail in the technical study. In addition, several proposals were put forward for interventions aimed at reducing the most glaring deficiencies. El barrio de La Mina es un conjunto de 2. 727 viviendas de promoción pública construido durante los años 1968 - 74, en pleno boom edificatorio del sector. Se caracteriza por la mezcla de tipos edificatorios y sistemas constructivos utilizados, destacando, por su relativa singularidad, la presencia de edificios en los que se aplicó la técnica de los denominados encofrados-túnel. El presente trabajo expone y comenta el contenido del estudio técnico elaborado a raíz de la confección del Plan Especial de Transformación y Mejora del barrio, que prevé la rehabilitación de los edificios y la recalificación urbanística y social del barrio, fuertemente estigmatizado por su elevada conflictividad. En dicho estudio se analizaron detalladamente los aspectos funcionales, las condiciones de seguridad estructural, el grado de aislamiento térmico, y las condiciones acústicas, de protección contra incendios, accesibilidad y mantenimiento de los edificios, elaborándose propuestas de intervención dirigidas a reducir las deficiencias más notables...|$|E
