5|$|To reach {{all points}} {{designated}} by the Admiralty for longitude measurements, it was sometimes necessary to take chronometers ashore, across inlets and up rivers too shallow for the ship. This put the chronometers at risk and the disturbance of moving them affected their accuracy. This was another reason for survey ships to carry a large number – most of <b>them</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> kept permanently in a safe, well-cushioned place on the main vessel.|$|E
5|$|A 1996 {{molecular}} {{analysis of}} 38 Suillus species used the sequences of their internal transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and clarify the taxonomy of the genus. The {{results indicate that}} S.spraguei is most closely related to S.decipiens. The species S.granulatus and S.placidus lie on a branch sister to that containing S.spraguei. These results were corroborated and extended in later publications that assessed the relationships between Asian and eastern North American isolates of various Suillus, including S.spraguei. The analysis supported the hypothesis that Chinese and U.S. S.spraguei and S.decipiens were each other's closest relatives, and the clade that contained <b>them</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> divided into four distinct subgroups: S.decipiens, U.S. S.spraguei, China (Yunnan) S.spraguei, and China (Jilin) S.spraguei.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, the Aldeburgh Festival was {{outgrowing}} its customary venues, {{and plans}} to build a new concert hall in Aldeburgh were not progressing. When redundant Victorian maltings buildings in the village of Snape, six miles inland, became available for hire, Britten realised that the largest of <b>them</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> converted into a concert hall and opera house. The 830-seat Snape Maltings hall was opened by the Queen {{at the start of the}} twentieth Aldeburgh Festival on 2 June 1967; it was immediately hailed as one of the best concert halls in the country. The hall was destroyed by fire in 1969, but Britten was determined that it would be rebuilt in time for the following year's festival, which it was. The Queen again attended the opening performance in 1970.|$|E

5|$|The Warden of the Fleet Prison, who {{was also}} keeper of Westminster Hall, was tasked with keeping it clean and letting the shops and booths along the sides. Despite acting as gaoler to the Exchequer of Pleas, Court of Chancery and Star Chamber {{as part of his}} duties the Warden was {{considered}} an officer of the Court of Common Pleas. All court officers were appointed for life, and could only be removed for misbehaviour. Despite this, the sheer number of positions meant that several came up for reappointment in each Chief Justice's tenure, and selling <b>them</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> very profitable.|$|E
5|$|The furnace {{continued}} in anemic health until the Panic of 1907. As {{a result of}} that crisis, it was idle for most of 1908 and half of 1909. It was operated in 1910 largely to use up its inventory of local ore, and went out of blast on January 23, 1911. Bellefonte Furnace had closed in December. The shutdown of the furnaces was to be temporary, but both facilities were no longer remunerative to operate, and no buyer willing to operate <b>them</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> found. Leftover pig iron and furnace slag from Nittany Furnace were shipped out over the Nittany Valley RR in 1912–1913. The furnace and railroad were put up for sale in 1914 and the furnace demolished. The furnace site was later used by the Titan Metal and Manufacturing Company.|$|E
5|$|As Mulder—in Fletcher's body—is dragged {{away by the}} soldiers, Scully {{begins to}} {{question}} whether what Mulder {{told her about the}} body-swap was true. Fletcher—in Mulder's body—approaches Scully and apologizes for telling Kersh and she feigns acceptance of it. After being reprimanded, Fletcher arranges a dinner date with Scully at Mulder's apartment. Meanwhile, Mulder is confined in a cell next to the mind-switched Lana Chee. Military police arrive and take Mulder to a meeting with General Wegman, Grodin and Smoodge. They believe that Mulder-as-Fletcher was trying to defraud the FBI, not help them. Mulder bluffs his way through the meeting, and claims that the real proof is safe and that he did not tell them about the scheme because he did not know if he could trust his colleagues, thinking any one of <b>them</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> the source of the leak. Mulder returns to Fletcher's house and tells Joanne Fletcher that he is Agent Fox Mulder, but Joanne thinks her husband must be undergoing a mid-life crisis.|$|E

5|$|Constellation {{began taking}} on {{prisoners of war}} from L'Insurgente, but by nightfall the two ships had become {{separated}} in a storm. Left aboard L'Insurgente were Constellations First Lieutenant John Rodgers, Midshipman David Porter, and 11 enlisted men, along with 170 French prisoners. The Americans were forced to sail the vessel short-handed while guarding the French prisoners. As the prisoners outnumbered their captors and no gear to secure <b>them</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> found aboard, the Frenchmen were driven into L'Insurgentes lower holds. Finally, after three nights, L'Insurgente {{was brought in to}} Saint Kitts where Constellation was waiting for her. While at the American naval depot at Saint Kitts, Constellations troublesome 24-pounder guns were removed and replaced with 18-pounder cannons. At the American prize court in Norfolk, Virginia, L'Insurgente was condemned to be sold as a war prize, with the proceeds distributed to the crew of Constellation. Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert managed to negotiate the prize award down from $120,000 to $84,000 before purchasing L'Insurgente and commissioning her in the United States Navy as the USS Insurgent.|$|E
5|$|This was {{addressed}} in the major production model, the Do 17 Z-2. The Z-2 mounted the new 323P-1 version of the Fafnir with 746kW (1,000hp), which was specifically tuned to the performance needs of the Do 17 by decreasing supercharger power at lower altitudes and thus improving low-level performance. The increase in takeoff power allowed the bomb load to be increased from 500kg (1,102lb) to 1,000kg (2,200lb). However the combat range with a full 1,000kg (2,200lb) bomb load was a very short 330km (200mi). The armament was further upgraded by adding another pair of guns firing out of {{the sides of the}} upper part of the pod, but as the three guns were all fired by a single gunner, only one of <b>them</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> fired at a time. From May 1940, 422 Do 17 Z-2s flew with Kampfgeschwader 2, Kampfgeschwader 3, Kampfgeschwader 76 and Kampfgeschwader 77. The upgrades of the Z-2 had its overall weight increased from 17,600lbs to 17,920lbs (7,983 to 8128kg). After heavy losses of Do 17s during the Battle of Britain it was decided to replace the MG FF cannon with the more powerful MG 151/15. Losses had mounted in spite of an increase of up to eight machine guns in some Dorniers. The standard MG 15 machine guns were retained. These features were present in the next variant the Z-3.|$|E

25|$|In 2014 NASA's Eagleworks Laboratories {{announced}} that they had successfully validated {{the use of a}} Quantum Vacuum Plasma Thruster which makes use of the Casimir effect for propulsion. In 2016 a scientific paper by the team of NASA scientists passed peer review for the first time. The paper suggests that the zero-point field acts as pilot-wave and that the thrust may be due to particles pushing off the quantum vacuum. While peer review doesn’t guarantee that a finding or observation is valid, it does indicate that independent scientists looked over the experimental setup, results, and interpretation and that they could not find any obvious errors in the methodology and that they found the results reasonable. In the paper, the authors identify and discuss nine potential sources of experimental errors, including rogue air currents, leaky electromagnetic radiation, and magnetic interactions. Not all of <b>them</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> completely ruled out, and further peer reviewed experimentation is needed in order to rule these potential errors out.|$|E
25|$|Arrangements {{with the}} Bedouin left the scrolls {{in the hands}} of a third party until a {{profitable}} sale of <b>them</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> negotiated. That third party, George Isha'ya, was a member of the Syrian Orthodox Church, who soon contacted St Mark's Monastery in the hope of getting an appraisal of the nature of the texts. News of the find then reached Metropolitan Athanasius Yeshue Samuel, better known as Mar Samuel. After examining the scrolls and suspecting their antiquity, Mar Samuel expressed an interest in purchasing them. Four scrolls found their way into his hands: the now famous Isaiah Scroll (1QIsaa), the Community Rule, the Habakkuk Pesher (a commentary on the book of Habakkuk), and the Genesis Apocryphon. More scrolls soon surfaced in the antiquities market, and Professor Eleazer Sukenik and Professor Benjamin Mazar, Israeli archaeologists at Hebrew University, soon found themselves in possession of three, The War Scroll, Thanksgiving Hymns, and another, more fragmented, Isaiah scroll (1QIsab).|$|E
