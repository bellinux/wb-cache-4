25|$|The {{brain regions}} {{identified}} in the above studies are associated with empathy, compassion, emotional regulation, and cognitive functioning. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> narcissistic personality disorder is related to a compromised capacity for emotional empathy and emotional regulation.|$|E
25|$|<b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> two {{processes}} {{affect the}} reminiscence bump phenomenon: (1) Events in adolescence are encoded {{more strongly than}} events that occur in other periods of life. (2) Because these events are initially stored more intensely, they will be retrieved more frequently.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{research}} {{has looked at}} the tinnitus distress reaction (TDR) to account for differences in tinnitus severity. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> at the initial perception of tinnitus, conditioning links tinnitus with negative emotions, such as fear and anxiety from unpleasant stimuli at the time. This enhances activity in the limbic system and autonomic nervous system, thus increasing tinnitus awareness and annoyance.|$|E

30|$|WBM leaf extract showed {{significant}} antioxidant, cyto-protective and anti-melanogenic activities. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> WBM leaves {{may be beneficial}} for preventing the photo-oxidative damage and melanogenesis of skin.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, <b>these</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the {{combination}} of muscle thickness and hardness as assessed by the ultrasound muscle hardness meter is capable of effectively estimating muscle strength of knee extension without muscle contraction especially in females.|$|R
25|$|Metabolites of {{ketamine}} including dehydronorketamine, hydroxynorketamine, and norketamine {{have been}} found to act as negative allosteric modulators of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the KXa7R1 cell line (HEK293 cells transfected with rat nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes) with subanesthetic and nanomolar potencies (e.g., IC50 = 55nM for dehydronorketamine), whereas ketamine itself was inactive at the same concentrations (< 1nbsp&µM). <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> metabolites may contribute importantly to the pharmacodynamics of ketamine.|$|E
25|$|Researchers have {{hypothesized}} {{a number}} of factors that could be responsible for these differences between countries, including national differences in overall income levels, self-serving biases and self-enhancement, and approach and avoidance orientations. Taken together, <b>these</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> while extraversion-introversion does have a strong correlation with happiness, it does not stand alone as a sole predictor of subjective well-being, and that other factors must be accounted for when trying to determine the correlates of happiness.|$|E
25|$|In a 2011 {{meta-analysis}} of seven randomized trials that compared a peer support intervention to group cognitive-behavioral therapy in patients suffering from depression, peer support interventions {{were found to}} improve depression symptoms more than usual care alone and results may be {{comparable to those of}} group cognitive behavioral therapy. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> peer support interventions have the potential to be effective components of depression care, and they support the inclusion of peer support in recovery-oriented mental health treatment.|$|E
30|$|<b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{the process}} {{involved}} in the genesis of hepatic failure in sepsis {{could be due to}} the cyclical repetition of the event: sinusoidal microcirculatory dysfunction - cytopathic hypoxia of the hepatocytes - edema of the columns of hepatocytes - compression of sinusoids - hepatic lobules dysfunction.|$|R

We develop evidence that the market-beta, interest-sensitivity, and residual risk of deposit-institution stock vary significantly during this period. Reassessing previous event studies in light of <b>these</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> event-study methods tend to overreach their data. ...|$|R
40|$|A crude {{aqueous extract}} {{of the leaves}} of the guava tree, Psidium guajava L. (Myrtaceae), were studied for antidiarrhoeal effects, to place one of its {{traditional}} medical uses. The extract induced a decrease in the propulsive movements of the intestinal contents in mice. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> an aqueous extract of guava leaves may be used as an effective treatment for non-specific diarrhoea in folk medicine...|$|R
25|$|A cyberpsychology {{research}} {{study conducted by}} Australian researchers demonstrated {{that a number of}} positive psychological outcomes are related to Facebook use. These researchers established that people can derive a sense of social connectedness and belongingness in the online environment. Importantly, this online social connectedness was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety, and greater levels of subjective well-being. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the nature of online social networking determines the outcomes of online social network use.|$|E
25|$|Cannabis use has {{increased}} dramatically {{over the past few}} decades whereas the rate of psychosis has not increased. Together, <b>these</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> cannabis use may hasten the onset of psychosis in those who may already be predisposed to psychosis. High-potency cannabis use indeed seems to accelerate the onset of psychosis in predisposed patients. A 2012 study concluded that cannabis plays an important role in the development of psychosis in vulnerable individuals, and that cannabis use in early adolescence should be discouraged.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have also}} found that {{recognition}} memory involving epinephrine depends on a mechanism that depends on β adrenoceptors. Epinephrine does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, so its effects on memory consolidation are at least partly initiated by β adrenoceptors in the periphery. Studies have found that sotalol, a β adrenoceptor antagonist that also does not readily enter the brain, blocks the enhancing effects of peripherally administered epinephrine on memory. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> β adrenoceptors are necessary for epinephrine {{to have an effect}} on memory consolidation.|$|E
30|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that tricuspid regurgitation increases after conventional or physiological repair, in which the tricuspid valve is left in the systemic circulation, and tricuspid regurgitation decreases after procedures that increase LV pressure, such as pulmonary artery banding. The clinical significance of <b>these</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> pulmonary artery banding may be effective as an isolated treatment for tricuspid regurgitation in patients with D-TGA after atrial switch repair and ccTGA [17].|$|R
50|$|Endothelial {{nitric oxide}} synthase (eNOS) mediates the {{production}} of the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO). Pulmonary arterial cell cultures treated with fasudil showed a significant increase in eNOS mRNA levels in a dose dependent manner, and the half-life of eNOS mRNA increased 2-folds. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> ROCK inhibition with fasudil increases eNOS expression by stabilizing eNOS mRNA, which contributed to an increase of NO level to enhance vasodilation.|$|R
30|$|A histopathological {{examination}} of the specimen from the right third finger showed cells with scanty cytoplasm and small round nuclei, proliferating in the trabecular and clumps with fibrosis. The nuclei were clear and pale with delicate chromatin. The tumor was immunohistochemically positive for neuroendocrine markers (synaptophysin and CD 56), cytokeratin marker (CAM 5.2), and CK 20. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> pathological diagnosis was MCC on the right third finger.|$|R
25|$|The {{cerebellum}} is {{the youngest}} brain region (and probably body part) in centenarians according to an epigenetic biomarker of tissue age known as epigenetic clock: it is about 15 years younger than expected in a centenarian. By contrast, all brain regions and brain cells appear to have roughly the same epigenetic age in subjects who are younger than 80. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the cerebellum is protected from aging effects, which in turn could explain why the cerebellum exhibits fewer neuropathological hallmarks of age related dementias compared to other brain regions.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin at {{a dose of}} 25mg/day for 3weeks {{has been}} found to {{decrease}} cortisol levels by 16% in adults with chronic insomnia and to increase melatonin production by 26% in healthy volunteers. In individuals with neuroendocrine dysregulation in the form of nocturnal melatonin deficiency presumably due to chronic insomnia, very-low-dose doxepin was found to restore melatonin levels to near-normal values after 3weeks of treatment. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> normalization of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the circadian sleep–wake cycle may be involved in the beneficial effects of doxepin on sleep and insomnia.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to close}} {{proximity}} of the structures, vestibular lesioning often results in cochlear damage, which in turn results in hearing impairments. Hearing {{has been shown to}} affect place cell functioning, therefore, spatial deficits could be in part due to damage to the cochlea. However, animals with a removed eardrum (usually causing the inability to hear) and normal vestibular labyrinths perform significantly better than animals with eardrums and lesioning in the vestibular labyrinths. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> disruption to hearing is not the primary cause of the observed spatial memory deficits.|$|E
30|$|Importantly, in our case, we also {{confirmed}} {{the existence of}} ER and PgR. In addition, we confirmed rapid growth of MCN during pregnancy in nine patients, and at least seven patients of them showed positive staining for ER or PgR. Interestingly, Tanaka et al. reported a case of MCN developing during continuous hormone replacement therapy after hysterectomy. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the existence of ER and PgR might contribute to the activation of MCN during pregnancy.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{identified}} a novel {{member of the}} Ikaros gene family, which has critical roles {{in the development of}} lymphoid lineages. This gene, which we named Eos, was expressed predominantly in the developing central and peripheral nervous system. Eos protein could interact with itself and Ikaros protein through its C-terminal portion in the yeast two hybrid assay. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Eos may have important roles in neural development similarly to the Ikaros family in the development of hemolymphoid tissue...|$|R
40|$|We studied, {{by means}} of video-polygraphic techniques, the {{clinical}} and polygraphic features of 7 cataplectic attacks in a patient with narcolepsy. Clinically, the cataplectic attacks were characterized by progressively increasing losses of the postural tone of cranial and limb muscles, that corresponded, in the polygraphic tracing, to a pattern of rhythmic suppression and enhancement of EMG activity. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the cataplectic fit occurs through a complex modulation, with inhibitory and excitatory phenomena, of the postural control system...|$|R
25|$|Epilepsy is {{a common}} {{neurological}} disease that is characterized by recurrent and sometimes untreatable seizures. Several clinical and experimental data have implicated the failure of blood–brain barrier function in triggering chronic or acute seizures. Some studies implicate the interactions between a common blood protein (albumin) and astrocytes. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> acute seizures are a predictable consequence of disruption of the BBB by either artificial or inflammatory mechanisms. In addition, expression of drug resistance molecules and transporters at the BBB are a significant mechanism of resistance to commonly used anti-epileptic drugs.|$|E
25|$|In {{studies of}} {{prepared}} learning, conditioned fear responses to images of outgroup males {{were far more}} difficult to extinguish than conditioned fear responses to outgroup females or ingroup members of either sex, as measured by conductivity tests of perspiration on the skin. These results held true whether the participant was male or female. Because the neural circuitry for fear responses are more developed towards stimuli that have posed a larger threat for most of human history (snakes and spiders, for example, which were dangers frequently encountered by foragers), <b>these</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> outgroup males {{may have been more}} of a threat to physical safety than outgroup women or ingroup members, supporting the male warrior hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{pointing}} gesture is a human-specific signal, is referential in its nature, and is {{a foundation}} building-block of human communication. Human infants acquire it weeks before the first spoken word. In 2009, a study compared the responses {{to a range of}} pointing gestures by dogs and human infants. The study showed little difference in the performance of 2-year-old children and dogs, while 3-year-old children's performance was higher. The results also showed that all subjects were able to generalize from their previous experience to respond to relatively novel pointing gestures. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> dogs demonstrating a similar level of performance as 2-year-old children can be explained as a joint outcome of their evolutionary history as well as their socialization in a human environment.|$|E

30|$|Stable isotope trophic niche {{analysis}} reveals reduced {{utilization of}} basal resource and trophic niche {{space at the}} midstream and downstream sites. By contrast, community trophic diversity and species redundancy were higher at the downstream than the upstream and midstream, likely {{as the result of}} reduced the spectrum of basal resources. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the negative impacts on the overall trophic niche space from reduced flow, increased water depth and stagnancy occurred only one year after the completion of the TGD.|$|R
40|$|Mikania glomerata Spreng. (Asteracae) is a plant {{widely used}} to treat {{gastrointestinal}} disorders in Brazilian traditional medicine. In the present work, an aqueous extract of the leaves of Mikania glomerata has shown {{a decrease in the}} propulsive movements of the intestinal contents in mice. Oral administration produced an inhibition of gastrointestinal transit as effective as that produced by loperamide. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the aqueous extract of the leaves of Mikania glomerata might elicit an antidiarrhoeal effect by inhibiting intestinal motility...|$|R
25|$|Single gene {{mutations}} {{can cause}} Mendelian forms of high blood pressure; ten genes {{have been identified}} which cause these monogenic forms of hypertension. These mutations affect blood pressure by altering renal salt handling. There is greater similarity in blood pressure within families than between families, which indicates a form of inheritance, {{and this is not}} due to shared environmental factors. With the aid of genetic analysis techniques, a statistically significant linkage of blood pressure to several chromosomal regions, including regions linked to familial combined hyperlipidemia, was found. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> there are many genetic loci, in the general population, each with small effects on blood pressure. Overall, however, identifiable single-gene causes of hypertension are uncommon, consistent with a multifactorial cause of essential hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Hormone {{replacement}} therapy consisting of systemic treatment with estrogen {{alone or in}} combination with a progestogen, has well-documented and considerable beneficial effects on the skin of postmenopausal women. These benefits include increased skin collagen content, skin thickness and elasticity, and skin hydration and surface lipids. Topical estrogen {{has been found to}} have similar beneficial effects on the skin. In addition, a study has found that topical 2% progesterone cream significantly increases skin elasticity and firmness and observably decreases wrinkles in peri- and postmenopausal women. Skin hydration and surface lipids, on the other hand, did not significantly change with topical progesterone. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> progesterone, like estrogen, also has beneficial effects on the skin, and may be independently protective against skin aging.|$|E
25|$|Glycolaldehyde, {{the first}} example of an {{interstellar}} sugar molecule, was detected in the star-forming region near the centre of our galaxy. It was discovered in 2000 by Jes Jørgensen and Jan M. Hollis. In 2012, Jørgensen's team reported the detection of glycolaldehyde in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422 400 light years from Earth. Glycolaldehyde is needed to form RNA, which is similar in function to DNA. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior {{to the formation of}} planets, eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation. Because sugars are associated with both metabolism and the genetic code, two of the most basic aspects of life, it is thought the discovery of extraterrestrial sugar increases the likelihood that life may exist elsewhere in our galaxy.|$|E
