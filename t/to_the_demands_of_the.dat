5|$|By {{the time}} of Julius Caesar in 54BC, regular legionary units were {{supplemented}} by exploratores, a body of scouts, and speculatores, spies who infiltrated enemy camps. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil war, the extraordinary measure of recruiting legions from non-citizens was taken by Caesar in Transalpine Gaul (Latin: Gallia Transalpina), by Brutus in Macedonia, and by Pompey in Pharsalus. This irregular and extraordinary recruitment was not, however, typical of recruitment during this period, and Roman law still officially required that legions were recruited from Roman citizens only.|$|E

In general, turnaround for completing all the puppet shots for each episode was two weeks or 11 working days.

The bill was passed by Parliament and signed into law by then President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam in December 2006, and since January 1, 2007 the state has been known as Uttarakhand.|$|E

Madame Nhu railed against Diệm agreeing to a power-sharing arrangement, asserting that it was the destiny of Diệm and his family to save the country. Madame Nhu's aggressive stance and persistent calls for Khanh to attack, prompted the general to threaten to leave. This forced Diệm to silence his sister-in-law, and Khanh remained with the president.|$|E

5|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the multi-party, representative, liberal {{democracy}} that governs the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating a form of participatory, direct democracy through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say in public policy. As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians hoping to be elected, they should get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach the politicians, informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that if they want to get elected, they must come and listen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E

5|$|Enzymes can {{be either}} {{activated}} or inhibited by other molecules. For example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors {{for one of the}} first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called committed step), thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways. Such a regulatory mechanism is called a negative feedback mechanism, because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration. Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cells. This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. Like other homeostatic devices, the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|Southsea is {{dominated}} by Southsea Common, a grassland covering an area of , which was first created by draining the marshland alongside {{the construction of the}} vapour baths in 1820. The common owes its existence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military in the early 19th century for a clear range of fire. The present day common lies parallel to the shore from Clarence Pier to Southsea Castle. Today, the common is a popular recreation ground, and also a venue for a number of annual events, which includes carnivals, Christmas markets, and Victorian festivals. The common also has a large collection of mature elm trees, believed to be the oldest and largest surviving in Hampshire, which have escaped Dutch elm disease owing to their isolation. Other plants include the Canary Island date palms Phoenix canariensis, which are some of the largest in Britain and have produced viable seed in recent years.|$|E
5|$|When Augustus died in 14 AD, the Principate legally ended. Tiberius {{knew that}} if he secured the support of the army, the rest of the {{government}} would soon follow. Therefore, Tiberius assumed command of the Praetorian Guard, and used his Proconsular imperium to force the armies to swear allegiance to him. As soon as this occurred, the Senate and the magistrates acquiesced. Under Tiberius, the power to elect magistrates was transferred from the assemblies to the Senate. When Tiberius died, Caligula was proclaimed Emperor by the Senate. In 41 Caligula was assassinated, and for two days following his assassination, the Senate debated the merits of restoring the Republic. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army, however, Claudius was declared emperor, but he was ultimately killed, and Nero was declared Emperor.|$|E

Monarchs gave in <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people, and the Jews were expelled from England in 1290, from France in 1306, from Spain in 1492, and from Portugal in 1497.|$|E
