The {{behavior}} of any other configuration can be explained as a superposition of copies of this pattern, combined using the exclusive or function. Any configuration with only finitely many nonzero cells becomes a replicator that eventually fills the array with copies of itself. When Rule 90 is started from a random initial configuration, its configuration remains random at each time step. Its <b>time-space</b> <b>diagram</b> forms many triangular [...] "windows" [...] of different sizes, patterns that form when a consecutive row of cells becomes simultaneously zero and then cells with value 1 gradually move into this row from both ends.|$|E
500|$|The <b>time-space</b> <b>diagram</b> of Rule 90 is a plot {{in which}} the th row records the {{configuration}} of the automaton at step [...] When the initial state has a single nonzero cell, this diagram has the appearance of the Sierpiński triangle, a fractal formed by combining triangles into larger triangles. Rules 18, 22, 26, 82, 146, 154, 210 and 218 also generate the same diagram. One way to explain this structure uses the fact that, in Rule 90, each cell is the exclusive or of its two neighbors. Because this is equivalent to modulo-2 addition, this generates the modulo-2 version of Pascal's triangle. The diagram has a 1 wherever Pascal's triangle has an odd number, and a 0 wherever Pascal's triangle has an even number. This is a discrete version of the Sierpiński triangle.|$|E

The results reveal that a higher rate of cutting lanes incurs a heavier traffic flow in normal situations while yielding the right of way relieves traffic congestion in a bottleneck situation.

The present article deals with experiments on aerated and non-aerated cavitation in a transparent horizontal venturi nozzle. The observations are done by means of a high-speed camera. In such a way the extremely rapid cavitation and cavitation-aeration flows are captured and further analysed. The post-processing techniques is based on the detection of the grey level on the series of images.

40|$|High-resolution {{vehicle speed}} {{profiles}} obtained from sophisticated {{devices such as}} global positioning system (GPS) receivers {{provide an opportunity to}} accurately measure intersection delay, composed of deceleration delay, stopped delay, and acceleration delay. Although the delay components can be measured by manually examining the speed profiles or derived <b>time-space</b> <b>diagrams,</b> identifying when vehicles begin to decelerate or stop accelerating is not always a straightforward task.

This paper proposes a new approach to identifying control delay components based on second-by-second vehicle speed profiles obtained from GPS devices. The proposed approach utilizes both de-noised speed and acceleration profiles for capturing critical points associated with each delay component.
