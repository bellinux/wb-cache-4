5|$|Modern writers {{all agree}} that Andrée's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} he wanted to go, on being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up,</b> let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andrée's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E
5|$|Squads {{from the}} larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a {{position}} at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the pump house. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown. They warned the Chinese they had one hour <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> and leave town. After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot {{and fell to the}} ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went. The smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.|$|E

25|$|In 1928 {{a strong}} Santa Ana Wind blew down the observatory. Its {{curator at the}} time was Mt. Lowe {{photographer}} Charles Lawrence, who escaped the collapse within an inch of his life. Fortunately he had the foresight <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> the expensive lens pieces ahead of time. The instrument has since been reinstalled at Santa Clara University.|$|E
25|$|Later in {{the same}} month, Key West {{suffered}} a fire that ravaged much of the city. Hundreds of homes and several cigar factories were destroyed, including Ybor’s still-operational main location. Needing jobs and not willing to wait for their homes and workplaces to be rebuilt, many tabaqueros decided <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> their surviving belongings and board a steamship for Tampa. The fire also encouraged several Key West cigar manufacturers to either build a branch factory in Ybor City or relocate altogether. Cigar makers in New York and Cuba also took note, and many followed suit in the coming years.|$|E

25|$|On 28 April 1975, North Vietnamese forces fought {{their way}} into the {{outskirts}} of the capital. Later that afternoon, as President Minh finished his acceptance speech, in which he called for an immediate cease-fire and peace talks, a formation of five A-37s, captured from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, bombed Tân Sơn Nhứt. As Biên Hòa fell, General Nguyễn Văn Toàn, the III Corps commander, fled to Saigon, saying that most of the top ARVN leadership had virtually resigned themselves to defeat. The inauguration of Minh had served as a signal to South Vietnamese officers who would not compromise with the communists. They began <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> and leave, or commit suicide to avoid capture.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) {{sought the}} ability <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> an MQ-9 {{in less than}} eight hours, fly it {{anywhere}} in the world aboard a C-17 Globemaster III, and then have it ready to fly in another eight hours to support special operations teams at places with no infrastructure. MQ-1 and MQ-9 drones must fly aboard cargo aircraft to travel long distances as they lack the refueling technology or speed to travel themselves; the C-17 is large enough to carry the aircraft and support systems and can land on short runways. Pilots traveling with the Reaper will use the ground control station to launch and land the aircraft, while most of the flying will be done by US-based pilots.|$|E
25|$|Silvio and Patsy rush <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> {{important}} {{items from}} the Bing. They are intercepted by two Lupertazzi hit men, Ray-Ray and Petey B, and fired upon. Silvio is hit multiple times while Patsy abandons the car and flees while returning fire. Silvio is left in a medically-induced coma, from which doctors do not think he will awaken. Tony arrives back home and, hearing about the hits, orders his family to go into hiding. Carmela and Meadow visit the Baccalieris, who are all in shock over Bobby's death. At nightfall, Tony, Paulie, Carlo, and Dante Greco drive to an old suburban safe house. Tony goes upstairs to get some sleep, clutching the AR-10 assault rifle that Bobby gave him for his birthday.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the first}} shots fired at Lone Dog, the {{soldiers}} advanced with a skirmish {{line and the}} Sioux darted at the flanks of the army, seeking weak spots. [...] Artillery fire discouraged the Sioux from congregating in large numbers. [...] An Indian thrust at Sully’s rear was broken up by an artillery shell that felled several of the warriors. Sully’s square of soldiers advanced steadily. The Sioux quickly realized {{that they could not}} hope to turn the soldiers back and they shifted their focus <b>to</b> <b>packing</b> <b>up</b> their tipis and equipment and protecting the flight of their women and children.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, Daryl (Norman Reedus) {{has been}} forced to travel with the Claimers, led by Joe (Jeff Kober). Daryl gets into a {{confrontation}} with Len (Marcus Hester) over a claim on who shot, and thus owns, a rabbit, and Joe informs Daryl of the rules, then splits the rabbit's meat between then. That night, when they rest, Len sneaks his half of the rabbit into Daryl's bag, and feigns the next morning that Daryl took it. Joe, however, reports he saw Len frame Daryl, and drags him away to beat him up. Joe returns alone and instructs the others <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> and move out. As they walk away, Daryl's sees Len's dead body, an arrow struck through his head. They come across the train tracks and discover the candy wrapped left behind by Rick.|$|E
25|$|In 1802 Napoleon {{built the}} Ourcq canal which brought 70,000 {{cubic meters of}} water a day to Paris, while the Seine river {{received}} up to 100,000 cubic meters of wastewater per day. The Paris cholera epidemic of 1832 sharpened the public awareness of the necessity for some sort of drainage system to deal with sewage and waste water in a better and healthier way. Between 1865 and 1920 Eugene Belgrand lead the development of a large scale system for water supply and waste water management. Between these years approximately 600 kilometres of aqueducts were built to bring in potable spring water, which freed the poor quality water to be used for flushing streets and sewers. By 1894 laws were passed which made drainage mandatory. The treatment of Paris sewage, though, was left to natural devices as 5,000 hectares of land were used to spread the waste out to be naturally purified. Further, the lack of sewage treatment left Parisian sewage pollution to become concentrated downstream in the town of Clichy, effectively forcing residents <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> and move elsewhere.|$|E

Without women such as her, though, the mainland will be left with not only a weaker economy, but an even greater pool of frustrated leftover men." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{inauguration of}} Minh {{served as a}} signal to South Vietnamese {{officers}} who [...] "would make no compromise with the communists", and {{were responsible for the}} torture and imprisonment of many NLF agents and their sympathizers. They began <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> and {{try to find a way}} out of the country. The aerial evacuation of U.S. personnel and civilians proceeded since 1 April from Tan Son Nhut. At 10:51 on 29 April Operation Frequent Wind, the U.S. helicopter evacuation of military and embassy personnel, U.S. civilians, and South Vietnamese citizens thought to be at risk of communist reprisal was put into implementation as the city descended into pandemonium.|$|E
500|$|Soderbergh admired Fishburne's {{ability to}} portray an {{emphatic}} and assertive figure in previous films. To Fishburne, Cheever was a [...] "smart", [...] "competent" [...] physician who often epitomized a [...] "voice of reason". Once he conferred with W. Ian Lipkin, a virologist {{and professor at}} Columbia University, the character's complexities were nonexistent for the actor. Fishburne stated, [...] "The personal stuff that I have as Ellis Cheever was telling my fiancée, soon-to-be wife, Sanaa Lathan, {{to get out of}} town, to leave, <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up,</b> to not talk. That's really easy. Any human being in that situation is going to do that, I think." ...|$|E

SpongeBob wanders away into a new place called New Kelp City and attempts to get a new job, unaware he is becoming a target for a criminal gang known as The Bubble Poppin' Boys, while Patrick, Sandy and a reluctant Squidward try to find him.|$|E

500|$|A {{civilian}} {{exodus from}} the city had begun well before the British fleet arrived in the harbor. The arrival the previous February of the first Continental Army troops in the city had prompted some people <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> and leave, including Loyalists who were specifically targeted by the army and Patriots. [...] The capture of Long Island only accelerated the abandonment of the city. During the Continental Army's occupation of the city, many abandoned buildings were appropriated for the army's use. [...] When the British arrived in the city, the property of Patriots was confiscated for the British army's use. Despite this, housing and other demands of the military occupation significantly strained the city's available building stock.|$|E
500|$|After the race, Sebastian Vettel criticised Lewis Hamilton {{for what}} he {{believed}} was excessive low speed at the restart after the safety car period, calling his behaviour [...] "ridiculous". He added: [...] "There {{was no reason to}} go that slow. If you want <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> the field you can do it earlier and not in the very last bit." [...] Following his 46G impact on Saturday, Carlos Sainz conceded that he felt [...] "a bit of dizziness" [...] {{in the early stages of}} the Grand Prix, though he added: [...] "But after lap 10 it went off and I could push normally without problems." [...] After his accident on lap twelve, Romain Grosjean spoke of his [...] "biggest impact for quite a while". He also revealed that the seat of his car broke at impact, but also emphasised the fact that he was able to escape unharmed: [...] "It's a testament to all the safety inherent in the car and the other safety devices." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} follows the storyline of the song's lyrics. [...] "She told me <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> all my stuff, I'm getting kicked out—the video starts off like that", said Roache. It opens with Beyoncé filing her nails in silence, as her ex-partner packs up his property, as Beyoncé orders him to leave. Mid-way in the video, Beyoncé follows her then-ex-boyfriend {{outside the house}} and leans on a 2007 Jaguar XK. She appears to be pretentiously caressing him; only for the {{audience}} {{to find out that}} she is repossessing things she bought for him. He leaves her and the car, about to ride off in a taxi. Between cuts, Beyoncé manages herself in front of a mirror; putting on a lipstick, wearing huge curlers and a high-waisted skirt. There are additional beats mixed to the arrangement for the video version that can be heard, when Beyoncé sings with her all-female band, Suga Mama, towards the end. It ends with Beyoncé greeting her new boyfriend at the front door.|$|E
