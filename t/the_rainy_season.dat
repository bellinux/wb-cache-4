30|$|The {{reproductive}} {{activity of}} D. melanostictus is seasonal and {{is related to}} the rainfall regime. Ovarian follicles begin vitellogenesis at the end of <b>the</b> little <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> and reach their maximal diameter from May to July, months when <b>the</b> little <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> abruptly ceases. Oviposition takes place during <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> and egg development occurs during <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> and <b>the</b> first main <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> of <b>the</b> year. Seasonality in female reproductive activity seems to be common in anurans from Bach Ma National Park. In fact, it was suggested that in tropical anuran species living in areas of pronounced difference between the little and main <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons,</b> oviposition is concentrated at the end of <b>the</b> little <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> and hatching occurs during <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> and early in <b>the</b> main <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> (Ngo et al. 2009).|$|R

5|$|An even {{checkerboard}} plot model {{dominates the}} green landscape during <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms}} of soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested at the end of <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{document}} the diversity and distribution of macrofungi in the Mount Cameroon Region. These were assessed at low and high altitudinal ranges in the four flanks of the mountain during <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> and early dry seasons of 2010 and 2011. A total of 177 macrofungal species belonging to 83 genera and 38 families were recorded. Species richness was higher in <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons</b> (134 species) than in the early dry seasons (89 species) and tended to decrease with altitude, with 116 and 112 species for low and high altitudes, respectively. Eighty-eight species were recorded only in <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons,</b> 43 species in the early dry seasons only, and 46 species were common to both seasons. Sixty-five species were found only in the low altitude, 61 species only in the high altitude, and 51 species were common to both altitudes. Auricularia auricular was the most abundant species during <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons,</b> while Coltricia cinnamomea was rare during <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons,</b> and <b>the</b> most abundant during the dry seasons. Six of the 12 morpho-groups identified occurred across the sites, with the gilled fungi being the most frequent. Cyathus striatus was found only in Buea Town during <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons.</b> <b>The</b> study established that macrofungal diversity is threatened in the Mount Cameroon Region and needs for conservation measures especially for edible and medicinal species...|$|R
40|$|Surface runoff and {{sediment}} production from different timber yarding practices, some using Best Management Practices (BMPs) recommended for Honduras, were monitored in experimental plots during <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons</b> of two consecutive years in pine forest highlands of central Honduras. Different timber yarding systems {{were applied to}} pseudo-replicated plots during <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons</b> of 1999 and 2000. In 1999, two treatments were studied: tractor yarding and skyline cable (a recommended BMP). In 2000, four treatments were evaluated: tractor skidding, skyline cable, animal skidding (another recommended BMP), and undisturbed forest (reference). During <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons</b> of these years, surface runoff volumes {{and sediment}} yield were measured at five 1. 5 m x 10 m erosion plots in each treated area. The results showed significant differences between traditional tractor yarding and the recommended skyline cable and animal skidding methods. Tractor yarding produced six to ten times more erosion during <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons</b> than cable and animal yarding. The improved soil retention of cable and animal yarding was especially important during September when the highest rainfall occurred in this climate...|$|R
5|$|Each year, some East African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} have a long-distance migration, seemingly timed {{to coincide with}} the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of their migrations in both the rainy and dry seasons can vary considerably (by months) from year to year. At the end of the wet season (May or June in East Africa), wildebeest migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of surface (drinking) water. When <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> begins again (months later), animals quickly move back to their wet-season ranges. Factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance, surface water availability, predators, and phosphorus content in grasses. Phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms, particularly for lactating female bovids. As a result, during <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly high phosphorus levels. One study found, in addition to phosphorus, wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen content.|$|E

5|$|The Garden of Words is {{considered}} a romance and drama film. It opens {{at the start of}} <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> in Tokyo with , a 15-year-old student and aspiring shoemaker, opting to skip his first class and sketch shoe designs in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen. There he encounters , a 27-year-old woman who is skipping work and enjoying beer and chocolate. When she notices the school crest on his uniform, Yukari bids him farewell with a tanka (a form of Japanese poetry), leaving Takao puzzled as to its origin and meaning. The two continue to encounter each other and socialize in the park on rainy mornings, but never formally introduce themselves. After Yukari expresses an interest in Takao's shoemaking, he decides to make a pair of shoes in her size. With the end of <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> Takao stops visiting the park and focuses on his work.|$|E

5|$|The dam {{discharges}} its reservoir {{during the}} dry season between December and March every year. This increases the flow rate of the river downstream, and provides fresh water for agricultural and industrial usage. It also improves shipping conditions.

5|$|There is {{very limited}} data on reproduction. Young are {{probably}} born near the start of <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> in November–December, when food is plentiful.

5|$|Three African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} {{take part in}} a long-distance migration, timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth on the volcanic soil short-grass plains where they can find the nutrient-rich forage necessary for lactation and calf growth. The timing of the migration in both directions can vary considerably from year to year. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> they migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of drinking water. When <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> begins again a few months later, the animals trek back to their wet-season range. These movements and access to nutrient rich forage for reproduction allow migratory wildebeest populations to grow to much larger numbers than resident populations. There were many long-distance migratory populations of wildebeest 100 years ago, but currently all but three migrations (Serengeti, Tarangire, and Kafue) have been disrupted, cut off, and lost.|$|E

5|$|A 2012 {{study on}} the effects of {{rainfall}} patterns and parasite infections on the body of the springbok in Etosha National Park observed that males and juveniles were in better health toward the end of <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season.</b> Health of females was more affected by parasites than by rainfall; parasite count in females peaked prior to and immediately after parturition. Studies show that springbok host helminths (Haemonchus, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus), ixodid ticks (Rhipicephalus species), lice (Damalinia and Linognathus species). Eimeria species mainly affect juveniles.|$|E
5|$|Although {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} J.lagostoma are almost exclusively terrestrial, the larvae are marine and planktonic. In order to release their offspring, the adults therefore have to {{migrate to the}} sea, as seen in other land crabs, such as the Christmas Island red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis. In {{most members of the}} family Gecarcinidae, migration coincides with <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> which reduces the risk of desiccation; migration in J.lagostoma occurs from January until March, while the period of highest rainfall is from March to May.|$|E
5|$|Common elands are nomadic and crepuscular. They eat in {{the morning}} and evening, rest in shade when hot and remain in {{sunlight}} when cold. They are commonly found in herds of up to 500, with individual members remaining in the herd anywhere from several hours to several months. Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually. During estrus, mainly in <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> groups tend to form more regularly. In southern Africa common elands will often associate with herds of zebras, roan antelopes and oryxes.|$|E

40|$|Information on {{seasonal}} Kiremet {{and seasonal}} Belg rainfall amount {{is important in}} the rain fed agriculture of Ethiopia since more than 85 % of the population is dependent on agriculture particularly on rain fed farming practices. The distribution pattern of rainfall rather than the total amount of rainfall within the entire period of time is more important for studying the pattern of rainfall occurrence. A two-state Markov chain was used to describe the characteristics of rainfall occurrences in this woreda. The states, as considered were; dry (d) and <b>rainy</b> (r). <b>The</b> overall chance of rain and the fitted curve tells us that the chance of getting rain in <b>the</b> main <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> is about twice as compared to <b>the</b> small <b>rainy</b> <b>season.</b> <b>The</b> first order Markov chain model indicates that the probability of getting rain in <b>the</b> small <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> is significantly dependent on whether the earlier date was dry or wet. While the second order Marko chain indicates that <b>the</b> main <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> <b>the</b> dependence of the probability of rain on the previous two dates’ conditions is less as compared with <b>the</b> small <b>rainy</b> <b>season.</b> Rainfall amounts are very variable and are usually modeled by a gamma distribution. Therefore, the pattern of rainfall is somewhat unimodial having only one extreme value in August.   Onset, cessation and length of growing season of rainfall for <b>the</b> main <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> show medium variation compared to <b>the</b> small <b>rainy</b> <b>season...</b>|$|R
