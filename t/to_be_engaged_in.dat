Where functions are considered administrative, delegation may not be wrongful. In R. v.

On the other hand, it is an established principle that no tribunal can delegate judicial or quasi-judicial functions such as disciplinary powers.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there was}} damage to two Spanish frigates: the Sabina {{was struck by}} cannon fire during the night killing one man and {{wounding}} five, {{although it was not}} determined which ship had fired on the flagship and James suggested that it may have been from one of the destroyed 112-gun ships in a case of friendly fire. In addition, the Spanish 34-gun frigate Perla was seen wallowing off the North African coast of the Strait of Gibraltar on the morning of 13 July, sinking later in the day due to severe damage. How Perla came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> the action has never been explained. The ship was not part of Moreno's squadron at Algeciras and none of the British ships reported engaging a frigate during the night – during the hours of darkness Perla must have encountered the battle and become caught in the cross-fire, suffering fatal damage.|$|E

In any case, the modern PWD, whether employed on a boat or kept as a pet or a working dog, loves water and attention and prefers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> activity within sight of a human partner.

25|$|According to Haynes and Klehr, Lore's {{contact with}} Soviet {{intelligence}} {{seems to have}} been ended in 1937 owing to a belief in Moscow that Lore retained ties to the Trotskyist movement.

In addition, Lore was believed by his Soviet handlers to have been guilty of financial improprieties, taking the form of double-dipping for multiple monthly expense stipends. In fact, the real reason for the Soviet's termination of relationship was their discovery that Lore had cheated them about the identity of his sources at the Department of State.|$|E
