5|$|A human {{going into}} an ala’s house, which is {{frequently}} {{deep in a}} forest, but may also be in the clouds, in a lake, spring, cave, gigantic tree, or other hidden remote place, or on an inhospitable mountain, can have varied consequences. If he approaches the ala with an appeal, and does not mention the differences between her and humans, he will be rewarded. Otherwise, he will be cruelly punished. According to one story, a stepdaughter, driven away from home by her stepmother, comes to an ala’s house; addresses her with the word mother; picks lice from the ala’s hair full of worms; and feeds the ala’s “livestock” of owls, wolves, badgers, and other wild animals; behaving and talking as if <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> quite normal to her, and is rewarded by the ala with a chest filled with gold. When the stepmother’s daughter comes to the ala’s house, she does the opposite, and the ala punishes her and her mother by sending them a chest of snakes, which blind them. In another example, when a prince asks an ala for her daughter’s hand, she saves him from other ale, and helps him get married. But when a girl to whom an ala is the godmother visits the ala with her mother, the ala eats them both because the mother talked about the strange things in her house.|$|E

And {{the first thing is}} to purify oneself, when someone comes to consult Amphiaraos, and the purification ritual is to sacrifice to the god, and people sacrifice to him and to all those whose names are on (the altar), and - when <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> finished – they sacrifice a ram and spread out its skin under themselves, lie down waiting for the revelation of a dream.|$|E

25|$|The {{architectural}} form which cathedrals took was largely dependent upon their ritual {{function as the}} seat of a bishop. Cathedrals are places where, in common with other Christian churches, the Eucharist is celebrated, the Bible is read, the Order of Service is said or sung, prayers are offered and sermons are preached. But in a cathedral, in general, <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> done with a greater amount of elaboration, pageantry and procession than in lesser churches. This elaboration is particularly present during important liturgical rites performed by a Bishop, such as Confirmation and Ordination. A cathedral is often the site of rituals associated with local or national Government, the Bishops performing the tasks of all sorts from the induction of a mayor to the coronation of a monarch. Some of these tasks are apparent in the form and fittings of particular cathedrals.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Rite has no {{celebration of}} Mass between the Lord's Supper on Holy Thursday evening and the Easter Vigil unless a special {{exemption}} is granted for rare solemn or grave occasions by the Vatican or the local bishop. The only sacraments celebrated {{during this time}} are Baptism (for those in danger of death), Penance, and Anointing of the Sick. While there is no celebration of the Eucharist, it is distributed to the faithful only in the Service of the Passion of the Lord, but can also be taken at any hour to the sick {{who are unable to}} attend this service. During this period crosses, candlesticks, and altar cloths are removed from the altar which remains completely bare, though <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> gradually added to the altar as part of the ceremony. It is also customary to empty the holy water fonts in preparation of the blessing of the water at the Easter Vigil. Traditionally, no bells are rung on Good Friday or Holy Saturday until the Easter Vigil.|$|E

25|$|In Western cultures, {{predictors}} of happiness include elements that support personal independence, {{a sense of}} personal agency, and self-expression. In Eastern cultures, {{predictors of}} happiness focus on an interdependent self that is inseparable from significant others. Compared to people in individualistic cultures, people in collectivistic cultures are more likely to base their judgments of life satisfaction on how significant others appraise their life than on the balance of inner emotions experienced as pleasant versus unpleasant. Pleasant emotional experiences have a stronger social component in East Asian cultures compared to Western ones. For example, people in Japan are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally engaging emotions (such as friendly feelings), whereas people in the United States are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally disengaging emotions (pride, for example). There are also cultural differences in motives and goals associated with happiness. For example, Asian Americans tend to experience greater happiness after achieving goals that are pleasing to or approved of by significant others compared to European Americans. There is also evidence that high self-esteem, {{a sense of personal}} control and a consistent sense of identity relate more strongly to SWB in Western cultures than they do in Eastern ones. However, {{this is not to say}} that <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> unimportant to SWB in Eastern cultures. Research has found that even within Eastern cultures, people with high self-esteem and a more consistent sense of identity are somewhat happier than those who are low in these characteristics. There is no evidence that low self-esteem and so on are actually beneficial to SWB in any known culture.|$|E

500|$|The Guardian asked six {{well-known}} {{film critics}} {{for their own}} perceptions of the overall meaning in Mulholland Drive. Neil Roberts of The Sun and Tom Charity of Time Out subscribe to the theory that Betty is Diane's projection of a happier life. Roger Ebert and Jonathan Ross seem to accept this interpretation, but both hesitate to overanalyze the film. Ebert states, [...] "There is no explanation. There {{may not even be}} a mystery." [...] Ross observes that there are storylines that go nowhere: [...] "Perhaps these were leftovers from the pilot it was originally intended to be, or perhaps <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> the non-sequiturs and subconscious of dreams." [...] Philip French from The Observer sees it as an allusion to Hollywood tragedy, while Jane Douglas from the BBC rejects the theory of Betty's life as Diane's dream, but also warns against too much analysis.|$|E

But the image in the Holy City is entirely a woman, and the grounds for their account are not very clear. They consider fish to be sacred, and they never eat them; and though they eat all other fowls they do not eat the dove, for they believe it is holy. And <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> done, they believe, because of Derketo and Semiramis, the first because Derketo has {{the shape of a}} fish, and the other because ultimately Semiramis turned into a dove. Well, I may grant that the temple was a work of Semiramis perhaps; but that it belongs to Derketo I do not believe in any way. For among the Egyptians some people do not eat fish, and that is not done to honor Derketo." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{banned by the}} Central Board of Film Censors of Pakistan due to initial scenes at the {{beginning}} of the movie which depict the country negatively, according to film censor board officials. A Karachi-based cinema posted on its Facebook page that the film would not be screened due to restrictions by the censor board. The censorship was due to the film's depiction of Pakistan as an unstable state and the fictional portrayal of a [...] "foreign invasion of Pakistan’s nuclear installations", which caught the ire of film censor authorities. Consequently, restrictions were imposed on screening the movie countrywide. According to an official at the censor board, the film portrayed Pakistan negatively not only on the issue of the War on Terror but also on the international standing of the country: [...] "There is a scene which shows the assassination of the Pakistani president and the imposition of martial law, which is not a fair representation of the country." [...] Another cinema official explained [...] "There were obviously several objectionable things which would never have passed the censors, but <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> also relevant to the content of the film." ...|$|E

500|$|While Christian theologians {{held that}} the natural world {{was part of an}} unchanging {{designed}} hierarchy, some theologians speculated that the world might have developed through natural processes. Thomas Aquinas went even farther than Augustine of Hippo in arguing that scriptural texts like Genesis should not be interpreted in a literal way that conflicted with or constrained what natural philosophers learned about the workings of the natural world. He saw that the autonomy of nature was a sign of God's goodness, and detected no conflict between a divinely created universe and the idea that the universe had developed over time through natural mechanisms. However, Aquinas disputed the views of those (like the ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles) who held that such natural processes showed that the universe could have developed without an underlying purpose. Aquinas rather held that: [...] "Hence, it is clear that nature is nothing but a certain kind of art, i.e., the divine art, impressed upon things, by which <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> moved to a determinate end. It is as if the shipbuilder were able to give to timbers that by which they would move themselves to {{take the form of a}} ship." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{academic}} Rikky Rooksby, [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] {{is an example}} of Brian Wilson's growing interest in musical development within a composition, something antithetical to popular music of the time. Suppressing tonic strength and cadential drive, the song makes use of descending harmonic motions through scale degrees controlled by a single tonic and [...] "radical disjunctions" [...] in key, texture, instrumentation, and mood while refusing to develop into a predictable formal pattern. It instead develops [...] "under its own power" [...] and [...] "luxuriates in harmonic variety" [...] exemplified by beginning and ending not only in different keys but also in different modes. Comparing [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] to Wilson's previous work Pet Sounds, biographer Andrew Hickey has said: [...] "he best way of thinking about [...] is that it's taking the lowest common denominator of 'Here Today' and 'God Only Knows' and turned the result into an R track. We have the same minor-key change between verse and chorus we've seen throughout Pet Sounds, the same descending scalar chord sequences, the same mobile bass parts, but here, rather than to express melancholy, <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> used in a way that's as close as Brian Wilson ever got to funky." [...] Author Jon Stebbins adds that [...] "unlike Pet Sounds the chorus of 'Good Vibrations' projects a definite 'rock and roll' energy and feel." ...|$|E

Later, it was reported by Mars that the record {{was scheduled to be}} the second single from the album. This release involved little planning according to Mars [...] "I felt [...] was good. None of <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> planned, which one goes first, which one goes second. One day I wake up and I say, 'You know what?

However, a week later, while performing [...] "When I Was Your Man" [...] on the third season finale of The Voice, he announced that the track played would be the second official single from the album. The fifth and overall single, [...] "Young Girls", was first liberated on Australian contemporary hit radio, on November 26, 2013, after being promoted by Mars in radio station, Nova. Subsequently, the song was released to United States and United Kingdom contemporary hit radios on December 10, 2013 and February 17, 2014, respectively. Italian radio stations began adding the track onto their playlist on February 26, 2014. Later, on April 4, 2014 a CD single containing the track as released in Finland.|$|E

500|$|Either/Or portrays two life views. Each life view {{is written}} and {{represented}} by a fictional pseudonymous author, with the prose of the work reflecting and depending on the life view being discussed. For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors. The book's central concern is the primal question asked by Aristotle, [...] "How should we live?" [...] His book was certainly informed by Epictetus; [...] "Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do {{you think that you}} can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. <b>These</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob."
