500|$|For {{an express}} trust to be valid, the trust {{instrument}} must show certainty of intention, {{subject matter and}} object. Certainty of intention means {{that it must be}} clear that the settlor or testator wishes to create a trust; this is not dependent on any particular language used, and a trust can be created without the word [...] "trust" [...] being used, or even the settlor knowing he is creating a trust. Since the 1950s, the courts have been more willing to conclude that there was intention to create a trust, rather than hold that the trust is void. Certainty of subject matter means that it must be clear what property is part of the trust. Historically the property must have been segregated from non-trust property; more recently, the courts have drawn a line between <b>tangible</b> <b>and</b> <b>intangible</b> <b>assets,</b> holding that with intangible assets there is not always a need for segregation. Certainty of objects means that it must be clear who the beneficiaries, or objects, are. The test for determining this differs {{depending on the type of}} trust; it can be that all beneficiaries must be individually identified, or that the trustees must be able to say with certainty, if a claimant comes before them, whether he is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E

It was shown the logic of the third way in co-management education with public-private partnership, commercializing education as a solution to obtain quality education. The methodology was an exploratory analysis of documentand literature pertaining to the subject.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{intended}} {{to investigate the}} “Balance Scorecard (BSC) model integrated with Resource Consumption Accounting (RCA) ” which helps to evaluate the enterprise as matrix structure in its all parts. It aims to measure how much <b>tangible</b> <b>and</b> <b>intangible</b> values (<b>assets)</b> of enterprises contribute to the enterprises. In other words, it measures how effectively, actively, and efficiently these values (assets) are used. In short, it aims to measure sustainable competency of enterprises. As expressing the effect of <b>tangible</b> <b>and</b> <b>intangible</b> values (<b>assets)</b> of the enterprise on the performance in mathematical and statistical methods is insufficient, it is targeted that RCA Method integrated with BSC model is based on matrix structure and control models. The effects of all complex factors in the enterprise on the performance (productivity and efficiency) estimated algorithmically with cause and effect diagram. The contributions of matrix structures for reaching the management functional targets of the enterprises that operate in market competitive environment increasing day to day, is discussed.

Enterprise Architecture seeks to build a {{rigorous}} model of an enterprise that identifies its component parts and their relationships {{for the purpose of}} planning the evolution of the enterprise. A Capability Management perspective - such as Leonard's model or Teece's Dynamic Capabilities Theory - suggests that a firm is best viewed as a collection of capabilities that have a composition from and configuration of the <b>tangible</b> <b>and</b> <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> of the firm. In this view the firm and its portfolio of capabilities evolve in response to the (perceived) demands of the business environment. An enterprise may comprise one or more firms, or parts of firms (or other types of organization) and their interrelationships - and so is describable (may be modelled) in the same terms.|$|E
