5|$|In 1907, Willson {{was chosen}} by acclamation as the Republican {{candidate}} for governor. Willson's opponent had been chosen at a nominating convention two years earlier.

5|$|Notwithstanding {{the level}} of {{controversy}} surrounding cost, the Scottish Parliament Building proved controversial {{in a number of}} other respects: the decision to construct a new building, the choice of site, <b>the</b> <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> a non-Scottish architect, and <b>the</b> <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> Bovis as construction manager after having earlier been excluded from the shortlist. In 1997, the initial cost of constructing a new Parliament building was given as £40 million, a figure produced by the Scottish Office, prior to the September 1997 devolution referendum, and subsequently revealed to be the figure for housing MSPs. Further controversy surrounding the project sprang from <b>the</b> <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> the Holyrood site, which was a late entrant onto the list of sites to be considered, and the rejection of the Royal High School on Calton Hill, long thought to be the home of any future devolved Scottish Parliament. After a formal visit to the Royal High School by Dewar and his aides on 30 May 1997, it was rejected as unsuitable on the grounds of size and location.|$|E

5|$|The I-5 and the I-6 were {{virtually}} identical in performance, although the I-6 took 15 seconds {{to complete a}} full circle versus the 9.5 seconds of the I-5. Both aircraft were armed with two 7.62mm (0.3in) PV-1 machine guns, but the production model of the I-5 {{was expected to be}} armed with four, although this proved to impose too great a penalty to the I-5's performance. The exact reasons for <b>the</b> <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> the I-5 over the I-6, which was debated for a full year, are not known, but likely relate to both of these factors.
