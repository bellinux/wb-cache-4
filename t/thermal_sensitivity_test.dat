40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{effectiveness}} of nasopalatine nerve block for anesthesia of maxillary central incisors after failure of the anterior superior alveolar nerve (ASAN) block technique. Secondarily, the possible innervation of the maxillary central incisors by the nasopalatine nerve was also investigated. Twenty-seven healthy, young adult volunteers (age: 17 - 26 years; gender: 9 males and 18 females) were enrolled in this study. All participants were undergraduate dental students of the University of Vale do Rio Verde de Três Corações. The volunteers had the anterior superior alveolar nerves anesthetized and a <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> <b>test</b> (cold) was performed on the maxillary central incisors. The volunteers that responded positively to cold stimulus received a nasopalatine nerve block and the <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> <b>test</b> was repeated. All participants were anesthetized by a single operator. Three patients presented sensitivity after both types of bilateral blocks and were excluded from the percentage calculations. In the remaining 24 patients, 16 had their maxillary central incisors anesthetized by the anterior superior alveolar block and 8 remained with sensitivity after the ASAN block. All these 8 patients had their maxillary central incisors successfully anesthetized by the nasopalatine block. In this study, 33. 3 % of the subjects had the innervation of one or both maxillary central incisors derived from the nasopalatine nerve, whilst most subjects (66. 7 %) had such teeth innervated by the anterior superior alveolar nerve. The nasopalatine nerve block was effective in anesthetizing the maxillary central incisors when the anterior superior alveolar nerve block failed...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} study was to compare the long-term stability of the mandible after a bilateral lengthening procedure, either by bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) or distraction osteogenesis using the "floating bone concept"(DO), and, furthermore, to evaluate the stomatognathic function, the neurosensory function of the inferior alveolar nerve and patient satisfaction after ca. 10 years. 40 patients who underwent mandibular advancement surgery at Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, between 1996 and 2000 were evaluated after an average period of 10 years (DO group: 9. 25 ± 1. 11 years, BSSO group: 10. 8 ± 1. 15 years); either group, BSSO or DO consisted of 20 patients. Of the 20 patients in the DO group 14 were female and 6 were male, whereas the BSSO group consisted of 15 female and 5 male patients. The long-term stability of the mandible was evaluated by analysing cephalometric radiographs of the patients, which were taken preoperatively, postoperatively and at the latest examination after long-term follow-up of 9. 44 years. Using a questionnaire and the Helkimo index, {{the function of the}} temporomandibular joint was examined subjectively and objectively. The neurosensory function of the inferior alveolar nerve was subjectively assessed by questioning the patient and clinically examined by means of the <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> <b>test,</b> the pointed-blunt test and the two-point discrimination. The subjective patient treatment satisfaction was assessed by subjective evaluation of masticatory function, and by establishing subjective patient satisfaction with the outcome of therapy. Although the horizontal relapse appeared to be greater in the DO group than in the BSSO group (P 0. 05). The position of the mandibular ramus had only changed slightly after advancement (less than 1 ° in the BSSO patients and 2 º at the DO-patients). The subjective and objective evaluation of sensory disturbance showed no statistically significant difference between the DO group and the BSSO group. Regarding the function of the temporomandibular joint and the mobility of the mandible, a significant functional improvement could be achieved in both groups. The majority of patients in both groups were satisfied with the treatment. These results show that the bilateral intraoral mandibular distraction (DO) using the "floating bone concept" and BSSO can be described as a clinically successful procedure that also achieves consistent long-term stability...|$|E

40|$|Sustained-release {{formulations}} of analgesic drugs are promising alternatives to repeated drug injections. Here, we compared a sustained-release formulation of buprenorphine (SB, 2. 2 [*]mg/kg) {{with a standard}} protocol of three injections of buprenorphine (Temgesic, 0. 1 [*]mg/kg/ 8 [*]h) in mice. Buprenorphine serum concentration and analgesic action (<b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity)</b> were determined in healthy mice. Additionally, the pain relief properties of both protocols were assessed after laparotomy using physiological and ethological measures of pain and recovery. Serum concentrations and <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> <b>tests</b> indicated duration of action of at least 4 [*]h (but less than 8 [*]h) with the Temgesic protocol, and 24 - 48 [*]h with SB. Behavioural and clinical parameters indicated at least partial pain relief after surgery for both protocols. Observed side-effects of buprenorphine independent of the protocol were increased activity, disturbed circadian rhythm and several abnormal behaviours. A tendency for decreased food and water intake as well as body weight reduction was also seen. Body weight decreased significantly in animals that received three injections of Temgesic, regardless of whether surgery was performed or not (P[*]=[*] 0. 015; P[*]=[*] 0. 023), hinting at a stress response towards this repeated intervention. In conclusion, an application interval of 8 [*]h (Temgesic) appears too long and might lead to repeated periods with insufficient analgesia in animals undergoing lasting and/or substantial pain after surgery. In comparison to the standard protocol, SB provided a long-lasting, assured analgesia without possible stressful repeated injections in a standard surgical model, with only limited and acceptable behavioural side-effects...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the repeatability of quantitative sensory tests (QSTs) in a group of healthy untrained cats (n = 14) and to compare the results with those from cats with osteoarthritis (n = 7). Methods: Peak vertical force (PVF) and vertical impulse were measured on a pressure plate system. <b>Thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was assessed using a temperature-controlled plate at 7 °C and 40 °C. Individual paw lifts and overall duration of paw lifts were counted and measured for each limb. Paw withdrawal thresholds were measured using manual and electronic von Frey monofilaments (MVF and EVF, respectively) applied to the metacarpal or metatarsal pads. All measurements were repeated twice to assess repeatability of the tests. Results: In healthy cats all tests were moderately repeatable. When compared with cats with osteoarthritis the PVF was significantly higher in healthy hindlimbs in repeat 1 but not in repeat 2. Cats with osteoarthritis of the forelimbs showed a decrease in the frequency of paw lifts on the 7 °C plate compared with cats with healthy forelimbs, and the duration of paw lifts was significantly less than healthy forelimbs in the first repeat but not in the second repeat. Osteoarthritic limbs had significantly lower paw withdrawal thresholds with both MVF and EVF than healthy limbs. Conclusions and relevance: QSTs are moderately repeatable in untrained cats. Kinetic gait analysis did not permit differentiation between healthy limbs and those with osteoarthritis, but <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> <b>testing</b> (cold) does. Sensory threshold testing can differentiate osteoarthritic and healthy limbs, and may be useful in diagnosis and monitoring of this condition in cats in the clinical setting...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate correlations between pulp oxygenation rates (%SpO(2)) and clinical diagnoses of reversible pulpitis (RP), irreversible pulpitis (IP), or pulp necrosis (PN). Methods: Sixty patients who presented with a tooth with endodontic pathology were grouped according to a clinical diagnosis of either RP (n = 20), IP (n = 20), or PN (n = 20). The clinical diagnosis was based on the patient's dental history, periapical radiographs, clinical inspection, and percussion and <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> <b>testing.</b> Pulse oximetry (PO) was used to determine pulp oxygenation rates. For every patient, one additional endodontically treated tooth (negative control [NC], n = 60) and one additional healthy tooth with healthy pulp status (positive control [PC], n = 60) were evaluated. Analysis of variance, the Tukey HSD test, and the Student's t test were used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean % SpO(2) levels were as follows: RP: 87. 4 % (standard deviation [SD] +/- 2. 46), IP: 83. 1 % (SD +/- 2. 29), PN: 74. 6 % (SD +/- 1. 96), PC: 92. 2 % (SD +/- 1. 84), and NC: 0 % (SD +/- 0. 0). There were statistically significant differences between RP, IP, and PM compared with NC and PC and between RP, IP, and PN (all P <=. 01).

However, they require experimenter manipulations and tend to emphasize reflexive behaviors. Here we introduce a new behavioral test, with which we examine <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of rats with neuropathic injury. We contrast thermal hyperalgesia between spared nerve injury and chronic constriction injury rats. This device is a fully automated <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> assessment tool designed to emphasize integrated learned responses to thermal painful and non-painful stimuli that are applied dynamically to a surface on which the animal is standing. It documents escape behavior in awake, unrestrained animals to innocuous and noxious heating of the floor where the animal is located. Animals learn to minimize pain by escaping to the opposite non-heated side; escape latency is recorded. On this device, thermal stimulus-response curves showed > 6 °C leftward shift in both groups of neuropathic rats. In contrast, when these animals were tested on hotplate the stimulus-response shift was < 2 °C.

40|$|Background: The {{change in}} the {{reaction}} time of a tail or paw exposed to a thermal stimulus {{is a measure of}} nociceptive activity in laboratory animals. Tail-flick and plantar <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (Hargreaves) <b>tests</b> are non-invasive, minimize stress, and can be used to screen animals for phenotype and drug activity. Objective: Hargreaves testing has been widely used in rats. We investigated its use to measure the activity of opiate analgesia in mice. Methods: Mice were used in thermal stimulus studies at 1 - 5 hours and 1 - 5 days to test acute and extended release preparations of buprenorphine. Results: Hargreaves testing had limited value at 1 - 5 hours because mice can have an obtunded response to opiate therapy. Tail-flick studies with restrained mice are not affected by the initial locomotor stimulation. Discussion: The present report describes a simple restraint system for mice. The utility of the system is demonstrated by examining the efficacy of acute and extended release buprenorphine injections in Balb/c and Swiss mice.

40|$|The first {{objective}} {{for this}} dissertation was to refine and enhance common techniques {{conducted in a}} laboratory setting including drug administration, anesthesia and behavioral modification for laboratory housed sows to improve the welfare of sows specifically by minimizing pain and distress. The second objective of this dissertation was to use an optimal dosing regimen for two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to determine their efficacy in pain management using nociceptive threshold tests when sows are induced lame {{through the use of}} a chemical synovitis model. The expected outcome was that in this lameness pain model, the pain mitigation agents will alleviate pain as assessed by two nociceptive tests. For the first objective, I developed and refined a technique for catheter placement into the auricular vein of sows. This method was quick, effective and reliable, allowing a large drug volume to be administrated successfully without relying on prolonged restraint or general anesthesia of the sow. Research confirmed that Yohimbine is an effective anesthetic reversal agent in mature sows when anesthetized with xylazine, ketamine, and telazol. Yohimbine reduced overall recovery time and maintained physiological parameters closer to normal homeostatic ranges. Lastly, the results of a study assessing behavioral modification in an individual sow demonstrating oral and locomotor stereotypies suggests the promise of environmental enrichment as an effective treatment strategy for mitigating stereotypies performed in a laboratory setting. The second objective of this dissertation was to use an optimal dosing regimen for two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (flunixin meglumine and meloxicam) to determine their efficacy in pain management using nociceptive threshold tests when lameness was induced {{through the use of a}} chemical synovitis model.

Microglial activity was measured by observing changes in immunoreactivity with OX- 42. NeuN and TUNEL staining were used to reveal whether apoptosis was attenuated by GDNF. Results showed that administrating GDNF began to attenuate both allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia at day 7. CCI-rats were found to have lower GDNF and GDNFRa- 1 expression compared to controls, and GDNF re-activated their expression. Also, GDNF significantly down-regulated CCI-induced protein expression except for MMP 2, eNOS and nNOS, indicating that the protective action of GDNF might be associated with anti-inflammation and prohibition of microglia activation. Immunocytochemistry staining showed that GDNF reduced CCI-induced neuronal apoptosis.

The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of RI delivered by 3 -dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3 D-RT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) on dental pulp sensitivity. Methods: Twenty patients with oral or oropharyngeal cancer receiving RT with 3 D-RT or IMRT underwent cold <b>thermal</b> pulp <b>sensitivity</b> <b>testing</b> (PST) of 2 teeth each at 4 time points: before RT (TP 1), the beginning of RT with doses between 30 and 35 Gy (TP 2), the end of RT with doses between 60 and 70 Gy (TP 3), and 4 to 5 months after the start of RT (TP 4). Results: All 40 teeth showed positive responses to PST at TP 1 (100 %) and 9 at TP 2 (22. 5 %; 3 / 16 [18. 8 %] for 3 D-RT and 6 / 24 [25. 0 %] for IMRT). No tooth responded to PST at TP 3 and TP 4 (0 %). A statistically significant difference existed in the number of positive pulp responses between different time points (TP 1 through TP 4) for all patients receiving RT (P <=. 05), IMRT (P <=. 05), and 3 D-RT (P <=. 05). No statistically significant differences in positive sensitivity responses were found between 3 D-RT and IMRT at any time point (TP 1, TP 3, TP 4, P = 1. 0; TP 2, P =. 74). A statistically significant correlation existed between the location of the tumor and PST at TP 2 for IMRT (P <=. 05) but not for 3 D-RT (P =. 14).

Maximum jumping performance of adult E peronii was assessed for each population at eight temperatures between 5 degreesC and 32 degreesC using a custom-designed force platform. From force recordings for each individual jump, maximum jumping force (F-max) and acceleration (A(max)) and maximum power output (P-max), take-off velocity (U-max), jump distance (D-J) and contact time on the platform (T-C) were calculated. The body mass of adult E peronii varied over their geographic range, from approximately 5 g for the lowland tropical population to more than 22 g for the cool-temperate populations. The <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of jumping performance varied over their geographic range, with the populations from the cooler climates generally performing better than those from the warmer climate populations at the cooler temperatures, and vice versa at the higher temperatures. However, not all parameters of jumping performance underwent parallel changes in <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> amongst the populations of L. peronii. Only minor differences {{in the shape of}} the <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> curves for F-max and A(max) were detected amongst the populations, while the <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of U-max, D-J and P-max all displayed considerable variation amongst the populations. The optimal temperatures for U-max, D-J and P-max were generally lower in the cool-temperate populations than in the tropical populations of L. peronii. To determine whether this geographic variation was due to genetic variation, or merely reflected phenotypic plasticity, I also {{compared the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of jumping performance between metamorph L. peronii from two different populations raised under identical conditions in the laboratory. The maximum jumping distance of the metamorph L. peronii was assessed at seven temperatures between 8 degreesC and 35 degreesC for the two latitudinally extreme populations (i. e. lowland tropical Proserpine and cool-temperate Gippsland populations). Like adult L. peronii, the metamorphs from the cool-temperate population jumped further than those from the lowland tropical population at the lower temperatures, although no differences were detected at the higher temperatures. Thus, geographic variation in <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of jumping performance in L. peronii probably has a genetic component, and the different populations appear to have undergone genetic adaptation of their <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to the varied thermal environments...|$|R

METHODS: <b>Thermal</b> pain <b>sensitivity</b> was <b>tested</b> among patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) and constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS) compared to healthy subjects. A total of 42 patients (29 female and 13 male; mean age 27. 0 ± 6. 4 years) with D-IBS; 24 patients (16 female and eight male; mean age 32. 5 ± 8. 8 years) with C-IBS; and 52 control subjects (34 female and 18 male; mean age 27. 3 ± 8. 0 years) participated in the study. Thermal stimuli were delivered using a Medoc Thermal Sensory Analyzer with a 3 cm × 3 cm surface area. Heat pain threshold (HPTh) and heat pain tolerance (HPTo) were assessed on the left ventral forearm and left calf using an ascending method of limits. The Functional Bowel Disease Severity Index (FBDSI) was also obtained for all subjects. RESULTS: Controls were less sensitive than C-IBS and D-IBS (both at P < 0. 001) with no differences between C-IBS and D-IBS for HPTh and HPTo. Thermal hyperalgesia was present in both groups of IBS patients relative to controls, with IBS patients reporting significantly lower pain threshold and pain tolerance at both test sites.

As {{the architecture of}} such devices {{becomes more and more}} complex to fit the RF manufacturer requirements. simple analytical models usually exploited to optimize their frequency thermal drift are found obsolete. The optimization of these complex periodic wave-guide <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivities</b> require the development of simulation tools capable to address the problem. This paper describes a Finite Element Analysis-Boundary Element Method (FEA/BEM) model allowing for the simulation any 2 D and 3 D periodic wave-guide <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> and more specifically the extraction of the corresponding Temperature Coefficient of Frequency (TCF).

40|$|Standard {{metabolic}} rate (SMR) and maximal {{metabolic rate}} (MMR) are fundamental measures in ecology and evolution because {{they set the}} scope within which animals can perform activities that directly affect fitness. In ectotherms, both SMR and MMR are repeatable over time when measured at a single ambient temperature (Ta). Many ectotherms encounter variable Ta {{from day to day}} and over their lifetime, yet it is currently unknown whether individual differences hold across an ecologically relevant range of Ta (i. e. thermal repeatability; RT). Moreover, it is possible that <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of SMR and MMR are important individual attributes, and correlated with one another, but virtually nothing is known about this at present. We measured SMR and MMR across an ecologically relevant Ta gradient (i. e. from 10 to 25 °C) in wild-caught salamanders (Plethodon albagula) and found that RT was significant in both traits. SMR and MMR were also positively correlated, resulting in a lower RT in absolute and factorial aerobic scopes (AAS and FAS). We found significant individual differences in <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> for both SMR and MMR, but not for AAS and FAS. The intercept (at Ta = 0 °C) and the slope of the thermal reaction norms were negatively correlated; individuals with low MR at low Ta had a higher <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Finally, individuals with a high <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> for SMR also had high <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> for MMR. Our results suggest that natural selection occurring over variable Ta may efficiently target the overall level of - and <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in - SMR and MMR. However, {{this may not be the}} case for metabolic scopes, as the positive correlation between SMR and MMR, in addition to their combined changes in response to Ta, yielded little individual variation in AAS and FAS. Our results support the idea that organisms with low metabolism at low Ta have a high metabolic <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> as a compensatory mechanism to benefit in periods of warmer environmental conditions. Hence, our study reveals the importance of considering within-individual variation in metabolism, as it may represent additional sources of adaptive (co) variation...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY The {{effect of}} {{conditioning}} stimulation on <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and clinical pain was stud-ied in 40 patients and six healthy subjects. Thresholds regarding cold, warm and heat pain percep-tion {{did not differ}} significantly between the painful and non-painful skin areas in patients or between patients and healthy subjects before stimulation. The patients received either 100 Hz TENS, 2 Hz TENS, 100 Hz vibration, or placebo. No significant changes in <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> were observed during and after conditioning stimulation in any of the test groups, although 24 / 40 (60 %) of the patients reported reduction of their clinical pain intensity. The results indicate that (a) <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is not influenced by the presence of clinical pain, (b) the effects of stimulation on <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (thresholds) and clinical pain are not closely related, (c) central inhibitory effects of TENS and vibration are crucial for their pain relieving capacity. Several studies have been performed to elucidate the pain reducing effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in experimentally induced pain in healthy volunteers as well as in pain patients. Few studies have actually compared the effect of afferen...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{studied the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of fibre Bragg {{gratings}} (FBGs), fabricated in single-mode standard telecom (SMF- 28) and photosensitive Ge/B codoped (Fibercore PS 1250 / 1500) fibres with high-intensity (140 - 210 GW/cm 2) 264 nm 220 fs laser pulses. The accurate measurement of Bragg wavelength thermal {{shift in the}} mentioned fibres brought about the values of 9. 62 ± 0. 04 and 8. 03 ± 0. 12 pm/°C, respectively. The comparison of the <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> values for FBGs made in the same fibres by low-intensity UV irradiation or by another inscription technique (scanning phase mask instead of static one) did not reveal any significant differences. This confirms that the <b>thermal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of Bragg gratings is determined only by the material parameters of the fibres and {{does not depend on}} the inscription mechanism and/or fabrication technique...|$|R

The experiments do not need more study as 'biological' phenomena, but they do deserve much more careful consideration from a chemical viewpoint. They are the only 'wet-chemical' experiments that scientists have performed on another planet, {{but they have not}} found very general use as sources of scientific information.
