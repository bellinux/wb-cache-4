40|$|A study {{explored}} the ethical framework of {{care as a}} leadership attribute in three female principals at an elementary school, a junior high school, and {{a high school in}} northeast Pennsylvania.

Carol Gilligan and others demonstrate that there is a continuing need to conduct research regarding the experiences of women. This is the case in educational administration, in part {{because of a lack of}} research despite the growing numbers of women in administrative positions. Extended interviews explored four guiding questions related to extending <b>the</b> <b>ethic</b> of care to females in the male sex-typed role of the principal, transferring <b>the</b> personal <b>ethic</b> of care to the professional sphere, enacting <b>the</b> <b>ethic</b> in making decisions, and maintaining <b>the</b> <b>ethic</b> in <b>the</b> bureaucratic structure of schools.

In contrast to more typical approaches to animal ethics which focus on <b>the</b> <b>ethics</b> of harming animals, Palmer asks, in Animal Ethics in Context, about <b>the</b> <b>ethics</b> of aiding animals, {{with a focus on}} the distinction between wild and domestic animals. She follows mainstream animal ethics approaches in arguing that humans have a prima facie duty not to harm any animal. However, when it comes to aiding animals, she argues that human obligations differ depending on the context.|$|E

5|$|Hadley has {{considered}} <b>the</b> <b>ethics</b> of humans' relationships with wild animals and environments beyond his property rights theory. He argues {{that there is}} a duty to aid wild animals in need, and that these duties are essentially no different to humans' duties to aid distant strangers who are severely cognitively impaired. He argues that libertarian property rights, consistent with Robert Nozick's interpretation of the Lockean proviso, should limit the right to destroy human-owned natural environments.|$|E

He also discussed the topic on Knowing Animals, a podcast series produced by Siobhan O'Sullivan.
