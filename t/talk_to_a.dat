5|$|In most Dragon Quest games, players must visit {{a church}} (known as a House of Healing in the NES translations) and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> priest or nun {{to save the}} games' progress; in Dragon Warrior, players had to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> king to save their progress, though the first two Dragon Quest titles for Famicom use a {{password}} save system. If the party dies in battle the group loses half of its gold and warps to the nearest save location where the hero is revived; players must then pay a priest or nun to revive their party members.|$|E
5|$|Natasha {{spends more}} time with Ed and attends a comic swap with him. Shortly before a press conference for the app, Ed finds an error and he and Natasha work {{together}} to fix it. While they are celebrating, Natasha and Ed almost kiss. Andrew asks Natasha to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> blogger about the app without Ed, which she thinks is wrong. When Ed learns what has happened, he accuses Natasha and Andrew of using him. Natasha tries to apologise, but Ed insists that she and Andrew pay him for his help and then they can go their separate ways. Ed and Natasha eventually make up and she asks him out on a date. Andrew reveals that an offer as been made for the app, but Natasha refuses to sell it. During a car journey to the city with her friends, Natasha learns that Andrew faked her signature to sell the app behind her back and an argument breaks out. Andrew tries to stop Natasha from calling the police and he bumps Chris' arm, causing him to lose control {{of the car and}} crash.

25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lot of different people at parties or Often feel uncomfortable around others. While some statement-based measures of extraversion/introversion have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For example, statements asking about talkativeness in parties are hard to answer meaningfully by those who do not attend parties, as Americans are assumed to do. Moreover, the sometimes colloquial North American language of statements makes them less suited to use outside America. For instance, statements like Keep in the background and Know how to captivate people are sometimes hard for non-native English-speakers to understand except in a literal sense.|$|E

He knew how to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small room of nationalists, but he didn't know how to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> thousand Yorkshire young geezers.

500|$|Fantasia {{began to}} make a profit from its $2.28 million budget after its return to theaters on December 17, 1969. The film was {{promoted}} with a psychedelic-styled advertising campaign, and it became popular among teenagers and college students who reportedly appreciated it as a psychedelic experience. Animator Ollie Johnston recalled that young people [...] "thought we were on a trip when we made it... every time we'd go to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> school or something, they'd ask us what we were on." [...] The release is also noted for the controversial removal of four scenes from The Pastoral Symphony over racial stereotyping. Fantasia was issued on a regular basis, typically for exhibition in art houses in college towns, until the mid-1970s.|$|E

500|$|Davies {{continued}} to submit scripts to the WGYT during his studies at Oxford, including Box, {{a play about}} the influence of television that Evans noted contained Davies' penchants for misdirecting the audience and mixing comedy and drama; In Her Element, which centred on the animation of still objects; and Hothouse, an Alan Bennett-inspired piece about internal politics in an advertising office. In 1984, he made his final performance for the WGYT and signed up for a course in Theatre Studies at Cardiff University after graduating from Oxford. He worked sporadically for the Sherman Theatre's publicity department and claimed unemployment benefit in the interim. In 1985, Davies began his professional television career after a friend suggested that he should <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> television producer who was seeking a temporary graphic artist for the children's show Why Don't You? ...|$|E
500|$|Ferguson had, on {{numerous}} occasions during his playing and managerial career, served as a substitute umpire, but did not start doing it full-time until after his departure from Philadelphia. In 1888, he became a full-time professional umpire, working in the American Association, {{and later in the}} Players' League in 1890. By the end of the 1890 season he had passed Kick Kelly to take over the record for career games as an umpire with 650; John Gaffney surpassed his final total of 786 in 1893. Ferguson officially umpired 804games if his National Association games are taken into account, and his career came to a close after the 1891 season. On his umpiring philosophy, he once stated [...] "Umpiring always came as easy to me", he said, [...] "as sleeping on a featherbed. Never change a decision, never stop to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> man. Make 'em play ball and keep their mouths shut, and never fear but the people will be on your side and you'll be called the king of umpires." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2001, American {{economist}} Joseph Stiglitz {{traveled to}} Belgrade to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> prominent Democratic Opposition leader, Zoran Đinđić, {{about the potential}} consequences of IMF-sponsored austerity. On June 25, 2001, Stiglitz published a paper, [...] "Serbia's Advantages in Coming Late", about the necessity for Serbia not to rush privatization and not to pursue [...] "shock therapy", which was the established macroeconomic advise of the Bretton Woods institutions. Đinđić, however, did not live long to analyze {{the advice of the}} Bretton Woods institutions or the anti-austerity plan of Stiglitz, as he was assassinated on March 12, 2003. This accumulated to a crescendo when G17 Plus got into an intense standoff with the Serbian government, composed mostly by DOS, {{due to the fact that}} G17 Plus continuously lobbied for the dissolution of the state union of Serbia and Montenegro. Later, in May 2006, Montenegro declared independence from the Serbo-Montenegrin state union; the United States immediately respected the results and urged the new government in Podgorica to keep close ties with Serbia. The United States recognized Serbia as the official successor state of the Serbia and Montenegro and the preceding Yugoslav state.|$|E

HitFix's Newman graded the song with a [...] "B-" [...] mark, and wrote that [...] "Drake comes in for a rap that works {{perfectly}} with the song in their first collaboration". Dave Hanratty of Drowned in Sound stated that [...] "Cabaret" [...] feels [...] "navel-gazing" [...] {{as a result of}} Drake's braggadocios appearance and the mechanical input given by Timbaland. Entertainmentwise's Amy Gravelle stated that Drake is featured on the track to add substance and style and proves that he was the [...] "hottest" [...] rapper at the moment. A reviewer of Capital FM stated that the song proves why Drake was the rapper on everyone's lips and further described [...] "Cabaret" [...] as a smart team-up between the artists backed by Timbaland's classic beats. On the negative side, Lanre Bakare of The Guardian criticized the rapper's verse calling it [...] "predictably self-indulgent".
