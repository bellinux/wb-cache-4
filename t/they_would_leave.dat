5|$|Following the {{marriage}} in Germany on 29 May 1815, Queen Charlotte refused to receive her new daughter-in-law, nor would the Queen attend the resolemnisation of the Cumberlands' marriage at Kew, which Ernest's four older brothers attended. The Prince of Wales (now Prince Regent) found the Cumberlands' presence in Britain embarrassing, and offered him {{money and the}} Governorship of Hanover if <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> for the Continent. Ernest refused, and the Cumberlands divided their time between Kew and St. James's Palace {{for the next three}} years. The Queen remained obstinate in her refusal to receive Frederica. Despite these family troubles, the Cumberlands had a happy marriage. The Government of Lord Liverpool asked Parliament to increase the Duke's allowance by £6,000 per year in 1815 (equal to about £ today), so he could meet increased expenses due to his marriage. The Duke's involvement in the Weymouth election became an issue, and the bill failed by one vote. Liverpool tried again in 1817; this time the bill failed by seven votes.|$|E
5|$|The SWAPO {{incursion}} {{became a}} complex political issue, {{and led to}} a week of tense negotiations. The UN considered emergency airlifts to bring more peacekeepers into the territory, and the United States offered aid. On 9 April 1989 an agreement was reached at Mount Etjo (the Mount Etjo Declaration), calling for the rapid deployment of UNTAG forces and outlining a withdrawal procedure for PLAN soldiers (Operation Safe Passage) under which <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> the country. Operation Piddock was the name for the Australian part of the operation. Horner wrote that if UNTAG were to play any role in ending the fighting, it was obvious that the Australians would be the key component. This was complex, and required authorisation from Gration and Defence Minister Kim Beazley for Australian troops to supervise the withdrawal of insurgent forces. It required the Australian Army engineers and British signallers to work as infantry, manning border and internal-assembly points. At the time, these were the only units which could be redeployed quickly to northern Namibia.|$|E
25|$|Although Kink.com {{has stated}} that its {{activities}} would be invisible to the surrounding neighborhood, La Casa de las Madres, a neighboring women's shelter, announced in late March 2007 that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be <b>leaving</b> the location.

5|$|Above ground, American and Vietnamese {{soldiers}} who had escaped death or capture tried {{to escape from the}} North Vietnamese. From the team house, a group of four Americans and about 50 CIDG soldiers held a quick conference and decided that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> the camp through the northern perimeter, where there was no visible sign of the North Vietnamese. Without much difficulty, the Americans and the CIDG soldiers were able {{to make it through the}} barbed-wire barrier, but North Vietnamese soldiers on the eastern side of the camp had detected their movement and began firing on the group. Ultimately, only two Americans and about 10 Vietnamese soldiers managed to escape from the camp, taking refuge in a dry creek bed that offered some cover and concealment. At around 03:30am, Willoughby made another request for the Marines at Khe Sanh to send reinforcements, but again his request was turned down. In an attempt to save the defenders at Lang Vei, Company C Headquarters in Da Nang tried to call for reinforcements from the Marines at Khe Sanh, but its request was also turned down. Finally, Company C Headquarters placed another Mobile Strike Force Company and a company-sized unit on standby alert in Da Nang, to be airlifted into battle as soon as helicopters were available.|$|E

25|$|The conventuals' pleas {{to allow}} them to stay {{acknowledging}} their steady service to the benefit of the convent and in respect of their faith, did not help it. On 6August Provost Marschalck personally intervened again at the three men in favour of the conventuals, but in vain. Kalkhoven offered each conventual Rixdollar (Rtlr) 75 and two barrels of rye, if <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave.</b> The conventuals rejected any gifts. The conventuals were then announced to be violently evicted by noon 28July/7AugustO.S./N.S.. With the administrator regnant, John Frederick, deposed and in exile, the conventuals and the provost were on their own and could not help it. So on 27July/ 6August 1630O.S./N.S. the conventuals finally left.|$|E
25|$|When the T. sessile, a {{subordinate}} species, {{was in the}} presence of dominant ant species such as C. ferrugineus, P. imparis, Lasius alienus, and F. subsericea, they reduced {{the amount of time that}} was spent foraging. This was tested with the use of bait, and when the subordinate species, such as T. sessile, encountered a dominant species <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> the bait. It would then make sense that the subordinate species would forage at a different time than dominant species, so that they could avoid confrontation, but there is sizable overlap in foraging period on a daily and seasonal basis. Because the T. sissile forages at the same time as dominant species, but does not want to interfere, they must have excellent exploitative abilities to survive.|$|E

50|$|After {{several weeks}} of {{operating}} in Iraq, the MEU received orders to redeploy to Amphibious Ready Group shipping for movement back to the US.

25|$|From 2009 through 2013, {{the game}} was {{scheduled}} to be played at Cowboys Stadium, now known as AT Stadium, in Arlington, Texas. During June 2010, however, Nebraska and Colorado announced that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> the Big 12 for other conferences (the Big Ten Conference and the Pac-12 Conference, respectively) in 2011. Because NCAA rules at the time required that a conference have 12 members in order to stage a football championship game that was exempt from NCAA limits on regular-season games, the conference dropped the championship game following the 2010 season. During this time, Oklahoma and Texas had expressed that a conference title game hurt the chances of the conference to have a representative in the BCS National Championship Game, and now the College Football Playoff, which started in 2014.|$|E

The Gate reappears and the two leave Snow White's world, following the light back to their world, which leads them to Erika. Rei questions why <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> her behind, but then realizes it must be because she is not the Seventh Princess.|$|E
25|$|The French vessels {{were the}} frigates Clorinde and Renommée, and the lightly armed flûtes Loire and Seine, {{en route to}} Guadeloupe with {{supplies}} and reinforcements for the colony. Overall command rested with Captain Dominque Roquebert aboard Clorinde. Roquebert's logs indicate he had not initially intended to engage the British, and had raised the Spanish flag {{in the hope that}} <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> his ships alone. However, when Junon and Observateur drew near, Roquebert decide to continue with the ruse of the false flag to lure the British into range of all four French vessels at the same time. The French suffered 80 casualties, including 34 killed. All casualties were from among the crews of Clorinde and Renommée which had come alongside Junon during the battle. Loire and Seine had engaged the British ship from the rear and had not come under fire from either Junon or Observateur.|$|E
