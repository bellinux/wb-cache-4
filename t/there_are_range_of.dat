40|$|Understanding and {{analyzing}} the irrigation related {{problems in a}} broader context of both technical and social realities, is necessary for an irrigation scheme development and management. In this view, {{this study was conducted}} at the Unnichchai command area of Batticaloa district during September 2009 to March 2010 to assess the status of the agricultural production, socio-economic and livelihood conditions of the fanners. The study shows that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> variations in socioeconomic and livelihood of fanners in the command area that determined the involvement of farming activities. Women's participation (12 %) was not at desirable level and there are misunderstanding of fanners in water use and allocation for their cultivation. Most of the farmers (80 %) are having a moderate level of socioeconomic status because of irrigation schemes. Only few farmers (14 %) are involved in large scale forming. As the livelihood is concerned, the farmers depend on alternative sources for income like inland fishing, The availability of grazing lands is the major constraint for livestock development, because during dry season most of the grazing lands are dried due to unavailability of water. Due to this the livestock farmers are shifting their livestock to other places. In crop development, the major constraints are the threat of wild animals, unpredictable rainfall pattern and water scarcity in tail region. It also revealed that, crop and livestock sectors of command area are growing exponentially {{after the end of the}} war by increasing the extent of cultivated land. However, awareness programmes related to community participation especially women's participation in command area development, efficient water use and water allocation will assist to improve the present conditions of the Unnichchai command area...|$|E
40|$|Background/ {{justification}} Following {{the end of}} {{the thirty}} years old civil war in Sri Lanka, there were expectations that the post‐war period would usher in peace, development and reconciliation. The last four years have witnessed several positive developments including resettlement of people and rehabilitation of infrastructure. Nonetheless <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> problems and policy gaps that have hindered the transition from war to sustainable peace. A key post-war challenge is that of violence against religious sites and members of religious communities. The attack on a mosque in Dambulla by a mob led by extremist Buddhist monks has reignited concern about targeted violence against Muslim religious minorities in Sri Lanka. The first serious riots against Muslim by Buddhists took place in 1915. After 1915, an occurrence of a riot of the same nature as that of 1915 was the violence in 1975 when some Muslims were killed in the Puttalam mosque due to a misconception that the Muslims were an economically privileged group and which fact fired the major motivation for anti-Muslim hatred. More recently, from last year, there has been an unprecedented level of violent attacks, demonstrations and hate speech targeting Sri Lanka’s Muslim population. Mainly perpetrated by Buddhist-fascist fundamentalist groups, the events have left the country’s second largest minority community - the Muslims feeling afraid and vulnerable which forcing a concerted campaign against them. In addition to attacks on places of religious worship there are calls to boycott Muslim shops and establishments, all of which is increasing tensions, particularly in areas where Muslims and Sinhalese live close to each other. These were virtually programmed by some prominent and influential personalities in governing circles, besides others who had a vested interest in seeing Sri Lanka imploding amid heightening ‘communal tensions. ’ It noted a ‘sharp uptick’ in religiouslymotivated violence and said the authorities are ‘passively and sometimes actively’ condoning extremist Buddhist groups, such as the ‘Bodu Bala Sena’ or ‘Buddhist power force’ and the Hela Urmaya are the main groups behind these targeting of Muslims. Objectives of the research work On this context, this study focuses on the recent incident of violence against Muslims in Sri Lanka. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} examine the motive for violence against Muslims as well as impact of the violence. The fundamental questions of this research are the following: why does postwar violence and hate propaganda arise against Muslim in Sri Lanka? In which ways the violence against minorities, particularly Muslims impact on reconciliation process? And why does Buddhist nationalist hegemony arise soon after civil war in Sri Lanka? Materials and methods This study is based on an interpretive approach. The data were collected from both primary and secondary sources. In addition to primary sources, qualitative interviews were conducted with selected specialist on this particular research area. Secondary sources such as published and unpublished records were also consulted. Finally this study provides appropriate recommendations to improve ethnic relations in Sri Lanka...|$|E
40|$|Political culture {{relates to}} the {{development}} and improvement of human abilities for social life within a community and creates conditions for the realization of these abilities. Typically, it is a state or a particular cultural region within the state. Despite {{the fact that the}} political culture of a society cannot and should not be subject to a management, it should be regulated and coordinated through a policy - national, which must be state policy. This paradoxical situation requires the use of specific management approaches. There is some configuration management knowledge, training or life, to work effectively, it is necessary to act at the right time and in the right place. Synergetic paradigm creates a methodological basis for a rather broad and full use of all the cultural, regional and individual diversity. Such use may be appropriate and successful implementa­tion provided competent management and, above all, self, which in turn requires a developed political culture in both the public and the private sector. It is important to understand that social system like any complex system, with not one single and multiple alternative paths of evolution. It should be clearly aware of the existence of different trends of evolution, the ambiguity of the transition to the future. Future states of complex social systems do not just open and predict­able, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> possible forms of the future, the field of possible ways forward. Value under the tran­sitional regime elements authoritarian and democratic organization of society {{is one of the most}} controversial issues. Between these two forms of political domination exists a close relationship than it may seem at first glance. To determine the influence of civil society in the process of becoming a democratic political regime and democratic political culture, it is necessary to outline the main characteristics of this concept. Without dwelling on the analysis of understanding of civil society can be defined as a system separate and independent from the state, interpersonal, family, economic, cultural, religious, political relations and structures that are designed to provide the conditions for self-realization of individuals and groups. Priorities of civil society are in inverse points of the political process - the elections, the formation of the state, where society depend on the prospects for change; renewal of power, improve administrative efficiency of its structures. Political culture permeates the entire set of relationships that develop between political actors, the po­tential impact on the form of government, the structure of its institutions, allowing effectively regulate the relationship between the state and civil society, ensure social consensus. Political culture is a factor that can directly help or hinder democratic political development. This confirms the practice of developed democra­cies, which shows that it is a democratic political culture, is the foundation of stability and dynamic perfor­mance. Understanding the political regime as functional characteristics of the political system, including the methods and techniques of political domination, and the order of the citizen, society and political power, helps to define the connection mode of political culture and its place in it.   In a democracy, trust in government is directly determined by its ability to real dialogue with public opin­ion and its main source - the civil society. Democratic political systems require for their existence a certain type of political culture. The lack of long-term and large-scale practices of democratic institutions and pre­vent the consolidation of a democratic political culture society. The main areas of transformation of political culture are: establishment of a democratic type of political consciousness, the formation of political behavior on democratic principles, establishment of a democratic culture functioning administrative institutions. The establishment of political democracy, its institutions receiving the necessary stability is possible only with the involvement of most of society to democratic values, awareness of the masses as the most perfect form of government in comparison...|$|E
