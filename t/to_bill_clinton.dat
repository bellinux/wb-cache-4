He was originally pledged to Bob Kerrey, but switched <b>to</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> after Kerrey bowed out of the 1992 Democratic Primary campaign on March 5, 1992. In 1993, Brown was invited to attend Bill Clinton's Inauguration.|$|E
5|$|After leaving {{government}} service, Matlock has occasionally {{joined with}} other experts to criticize U.S. government policy. On June 26, 1997, he signed an Open Letter <b>to</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> criticizing plans for NATO expansion. His reason for opposition, as given {{in his testimony}} before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, {{is the belief that}} NATO expansion will preclude significant nuclear arms reduction with Russia, and consequently increase the risk of a terrorist nuclear attack.|$|E

Although {{he did not have}} an MBA degree or prior banking experience, he became a managing director at the firm’s Chicago office in 1999, and according to Congressional disclosures, made $16.2 million in his two-and-a-half-years as a banker. At Wasserstein Perella, he worked on eight deals, including the acquisition by Commonwealth Edison of Peco Energy and the purchase by GTCR Golder Rauner of the SecurityLink home security unit from SBC Communications.|$|E

25|$|Bentsen {{considered}} {{running for}} president in the 1992 presidential election, but he, {{along with many other}} Democrats, backed out because of Bush's apparent popularity following the 1991 Gulf War.

25|$|In 1986, Bush {{becomes a}} born-again Christian, gives up alcohol, and mends his {{relationship}} with his father. The elder Bush invites him to assist with what becomes his 1988 presidential campaign, although Bush himself suspects that he only was asked because Jeb was busy. Bush's political advisor, Karl Rove, tells him that he has the potential {{to make a name for}} himself. Bush becomes a front office executive of the Texas Rangers baseball team, while his father oversees the victory of the Gulf War. Although Allied forces win the war within 100 hours, the elder Bush decides not to invade Iraq to depose Saddam Hussein. After his father loses the 1992 presidential election <b>to</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> Bush blames the loss on his decision not to depose Saddam.|$|E

25|$|When Lloyd {{did not run}} for {{re-election}} in 1994, Wamp ran again. Battling through a hotly contested primary, he easily defeated his childhood friend and sitting State Representative Kenneth J. Meyer by nearly two to one. During the race, Wamp signed the Contract with America. He also personally committed to serve only six terms if elected and further committed to not accept special interest PAC money. He proposed a plan to pay congressmen the same as Lieutenant Colonels and linked his Democratic opponent, Randy Button, <b>to</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton.</b> Wamp won the general election with 52% of the vote, during the Republican Revolution. He likely got coattails from Bill Frist and Fred Thompsons strong 1994 statewide elections, and was helped in 1996 by Lloyd crossing party lines to endorse him. After his first two elections, he never faced another close contest, and was reelected seven times.|$|E

25|$|Early on, McGuinty {{set down}} three {{strategic}} imperatives. First, no tax cuts. This ran against {{the conventional wisdom}} of politics {{that you had to}} offer tax cuts to win; everyone from Mike Harris <b>to</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> had campaigned on reducing the tax burden on the middle class. But McGuinty was determined that Ontario voters would accept that the money was needed to restore public health care and education services. Second, a positive tone. McGuinty wanted to avoid the typical opposition leader role of automatically opposing whatever the government announced, and instead, set the agenda with positive alternatives. While attacking your opponent was important, that would be left to caucus surrogates. Third, one big team. At the time, the Ontario Liberal Party was riven into factions. Peterson-era people distrusted more recent arrivals. Jean Chrétien supporters fought with Paul Martin supporters. McGuinty set a tone that divisions were left at the door.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party {{also has}} {{considerable}} {{support in the}} small but growing Asian American population. The Asian American population had been a stronghold of the Republican Party until the United States presidential election of 1992 in which George H. W. Bush won 55% of the Asian American vote, compared <b>to</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> winning 31%, and Ross Perot winning 15% of the Asian vote. Originally, {{the vast majority of}} Asian Americans consisted of strongly anti-communist, pro-democracy Vietnamese refugees, Chinese Americans, Taiwanese Americans, Korean Americans, and socially conservative Filipinos who fled Ferdinand Marcos in the 1960s through the 1980s, and the general Republican Party's socially conservative, fervently anti-communist position strongly resonated with this original demographic. The Democratic party made gains among the Asian American population starting with 1996 and in 2006, won 62% of the Asian American vote. Exit polls after the 2008 presidential election indicated that Democratic candidate, Barack Obama won 62% of the Asian American vote nationwide. In the 2012 Presidential election, 73% of the Asian American electorate voted for Obama's re-election.|$|E
25|$|He {{attended}} Gilman School in Baltimore, {{and then}} went to Harvard University, graduating in 1968 with a degree in Dutch art history. During his time at Gilman, Symington met Thomas Caplan, who would later introduce him <b>to</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> during college. At 19 years old, Symington rescued Clinton from nearly drowning during a trip to Hyannis Port, Massachusetts near the Kennedy compound. While studying at Harvard, Symington discovered the works of Nobel Prize winner Friedrich Hayek, an economist, social theorist and political philosopher who promoted limited government and free markets. Hayek's work would serve as an influence for Symington's political beliefs in regards to fiscal and taxation policy as Governor. Symington was also a supporter of Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election against Lyndon B. Johnson. Beginning in 1967, he served in the United States Air Force during the Vietnam War, and was stationed at Luke Air Force Base near Glendale, Arizona. In 1971, he was awarded the Bronze Star for meritorious service, before being honorably discharged. He remained in Arizona and became involved in real estate development, founding his own company, The Symington Company, in 1976. In 1983, he was appointed to Southwest Savings and Loan Association board of directors which was based in Salt Lake City, Utah.|$|E

25|$|Despite poor showings in the Iowa caucus (1.6%) and the New Hampshire primary (8%), Brown soon {{managed to}} win narrow {{victories}} in Maine, Colorado, Nevada, and Vermont, {{but he continued}} {{to be considered a}} small threat for much of the campaign. It was not until shortly after Super Tuesday, when the field had been narrowed to Brown, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, and front-runner then-Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, that Brown began to emerge as a major contender {{in the eyes of the}} press. On March 17, Brown forced Tsongas from the race when he received a strong third-place showing in the Illinois primary and then defeated the senator for second place in the Michigan primary by a wide margin. Exactly one week later, he cemented his position as a major threat to Clinton when he eked out a narrow win in the bitterly fought Connecticut primary. As the press focused on the primaries in New York and Wisconsin, which were both to be held on the same day, Brown, who had taken the lead in polls in both states, made a gaffe: He announced to an audience of various leaders of New York City's Jewish community that, if nominated, he would consider the Reverend Jesse Jackson as a vice-presidential candidate. Jackson, who had made a pair of anti-semitic comments about Jews in general, and New York City's Jews in particular, while running for president in 1984, was still mistrusted within the Jewish community. Jackson also had ties to Louis Farrakhan, infamous for his own anti-semitic statements, and with Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Brown's polling numbers suffered. On April 7, he lost narrowly <b>to</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> in Wisconsin (37%–34%), and dramatically in New York (41%–26%).|$|E
500|$|Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush {{of lying}} and {{comparing}} the governor <b>to</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> which Bush said was [...] "about as low a blow {{as you can}} give in a Republican primary". An anonymous smear campaign began against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, and audience plants. The smears claimed that McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter was adopted from Bangladesh), that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, {{that he was a}} homosexual, and that he was a [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] who was either a traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days. The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with the attacks.|$|E
500|$|Animaniacs had {{a variety}} of music types. Many Animaniacs songs were parodies of {{classical}} or folk music with educational lyrics. Notable ones include [...] "Yakko's World", in which Yakko sings {{the names of all}} 200-some nations of the world to the tune of the [...] "Mexican Hat Dance". [...] "Wakko's America" [...] listed all the United States and their capitals to the tune of [...] "Turkey in the Straw". Another song, titled [...] "The Presidents", named every US president (up <b>to</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> due to production date) to the tune of the [...] "William Tell Overture" [...] (with a very brief usage of the tune [...] "Dixie"). Non-educational songs included parodies, such as the segment [...] "Slippin' on the Ice", a parody of [...] "Singin' in the Rain". Most of the groups of characters even had their own theme songs for their segment on the show.|$|E
