25|$|Throughout its development, gaming in {{rehabilitation}} {{has gained a}} large amount of support for its differences in comparison to regular therapeutic methods. The biggest of these differences is the user engagement and enjoyment. It has been extensively shown <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> more engaged in a gaming environment and less contained in a doctors office when interacting in a virtual reality, gaming environment. Additionally, those who are able to participate in gaming rehabilitation have also been shown to use less energy than those participating in normal therapeutic methods. While this may not be positive for all patients, this is beneficial for those patients who may be elderly or have minimal energy to expend in therapy-type settings. Saving energy while still participating in therapy has proven effective for these groups of people, since they are still able to progress in their goals towards rehabilitation, but not over-work themselves in the process.|$|E

The fact that positive testimonials are so readily obtained from est graduates, in combination with the observation that a majority of people who take the est training, continue to participate and have found the est experience to be rewarding.

[...] "The Piccolo Snare" [...] is about [...] "societies {{torn apart by}} war and the waste of human life". The track uses the {{vocabulary}} of the Falklands War (Tumbledown, Skyhawks etc.) but Rhys claims it is applicable to any war. [...] "Liberty Belle" [...] {{tells the story of}} two cartoon characters devised by Rhys, 'Liberty Belle' and 'Memory Lane', the former representing the [...] "bells of freedom", specifically the American Dream, and the latter representing [...] "history's harsh lessons" [...] which Liberty Belle has failed to learn. The song is told {{from the perspective of a}} [...] "bird living almost in a parallel universe to humans, oblivious to the gravity of the games which are being played around us", something which Rhys admits to feeling himself much of the time. [...] "Venus and Serena" [...] uses a story of a child who talks to his pet tortoises, Venus and Serena, as he can't communicate with his elders to make a similar point: <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> alienated from their elected leaders. Both [...] "Out of Control" [...] and [...] "Slow Life" [...] feature regurgitated media buzzwords, with [...] "Out of Control's" [...] "flippant" [...] lyrics designed to create the feel of [...] "an over-dramatic theme to a current affairs programme".

500|$|The nature writers Mark Cocker and Richard Mabey, {{reviewing}} people's love of birds, {{observe that}} people are touched by feelings for birds {{in a variety of}} ways, such as enjoying the lapwing's [...] "joyous display", or the [...] "beauty and mystery" [...] of the tawny owl's call on a cold winter's night. They argue <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> the simple companionship of birds, are inspired by them to create art, let them mark the seasons and provide a sense of place, and use them [...] "as symbols of joy and love". A former statesman, Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon, was able to express his feeling for birds in his 1927 book The Charm of Birds. Such feelings, in turn, have stimulated the intention to conserve birds and their habitats. Around the same time as Grey was writing, the first conservation organisations were coming into being, starting in Britain, triggered by the rapid disappearance of familiar species as they were captured for their feathers or for food. A substantial folklore rich in symbolism has accrued around birds; it was documented early in the 20th century as something that was already fading from memory. For example, the house sparrow has been associated with [...] "sex and lechery" [...] since ancient Egypt, where libidinousness was written with the sparrow hieroglyph. In the same vein, in the classical era the sparrow was sacred to the goddess of love, Aphrodite or Venus; the sparrow features in an erotic poem by Catullus for the same reason. Chaucer describes the summoner in his Canterbury Tales as being as [...] "lecherous as a sparwe".|$|E
500|$|In {{his film}} debut Primal Fear (1996), Norton played Aaron Stampler, an altar boy who {{is charged with}} the murder of a Roman Catholic {{archbishop}} and is defended by Martin Vail (Richard Gere). The film is an adaptation of William Diehl's novel. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: [...] "Norton gives a performance that's fully the equal of Gere's – he's as slyly self-effacing as Gere is slyly ostentatious." [...] Alison Macor of The Austin Chronicle, in review of the film, wrote, [...] "Norton's performance and the well-paced tension preceding the movie's climactic sequence provide an entertaining if slightly predictable thriller." [...] Despite the mixed reviews, Norton won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. That same year, Norton played lawyer Alan Isaacman in The People vs. Larry Flynt. In 1998, he played Derek Vinyard, a reformed neo-Nazi, in the film American History X, David Denby of The New Yorker noted that he gives Derek [...] "ambiguous erotic allure; he's almost appealing". The film received positive reviews and grossed over $23 million worldwide at the box office. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. Later, Norton starred with Matt Damon in Rounders, which follows two friends who urgently need to earn enough cash playing poker to pay off a huge debt. In David Fincher's 1999 film Fight Club, Norton played an unreliable narrator who feels trapped in his white-collar position. It is based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name. To prepare for the role, Norton took lessons in boxing, taekwondo and grappling. Fight Club premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival. During promotion for the film, he said, [...] "I feel that Fight Club really, in a way... probed into the despair and paralysis <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> in the face of having inherited this value system out of advertising." [...] The film failed to meet expectations at the box office, and received polarized reactions from film critics. However, it became a cult classic after its DVD release.|$|E

2500|$|Although nature {{relatedness}} is {{a stable}} individual trait, it can change based on one's experience with nature, [...] so <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> more connected to nature (and {{are more concerned}} about nature) after exposure to nature Spending time in nature (and feeling connected to nature) may be one way to motivate environmentally friendly behaviours.

2500|$|Psychological {{flexibility}} {{has been}} found to improve mental health and absence rates. A mediating variable is job control, which suggests <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> they have more psychological flexibility when they have more control over their jobs. This is likely due to workers feeling less restricted by what they are allowed to do and more empowered to solve a problem. A longitudinal study on psychological flexibility and job control showed that these variables predicted workers’ mental health, job performance, and even their ability to learn new software. The study demonstrates the power of psychological flexibility in the workplace as psychologically flexible workers have better mental health and job performance. Allowing workers more job control would likely increase work productivity as it would increase the workers’ psychological flexibility. In leadership studies, flexibility, defined as [...] "the ability to get along with different groups and adapt to the demands of many organizations," [...] is one aspect of portability, or the ability to acquire skills and move from one company to the next.|$|E
