5|$|In the {{clinical}} sense, a disorder {{is a condition}} requiring treatment as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. There {{is a lack of}} consensus about the precise meaning of the term 'attachment disorder' although there is general agreement that such disorders only arise following early adverse caregiving experiences. Reactive attachment disorder indicates the absence of either or both the main aspects of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure. This can occur either in institutions, or with repeated changes of caregiver, or from extremely neglectful primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs after the age of 6 months. Current official classifications of RAD under DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 are largely based on <b>this</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the nature of attachment.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} ability to quickly grow and the {{relative}} ease with which they can be manipulated, bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of molecular biology, genetics and biochemistry. By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, enzymes and metabolic pathways in bacteria, then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms. This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of enzyme kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. This is achievable in some well-studied bacteria, with models of Escherichia coli metabolism now being produced and tested. <b>This</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use of biotechnology to bioengineer bacteria for the production of therapeutic proteins, such as insulin, growth factors, or antibodies.|$|E

25|$|Within the Pagan movement, {{there can}} be found many deities, both male and female, who have various {{associations}} and embody forces of nature, aspects of culture, and facets of human psychology. These deities are typically depicted in human form, and are viewed as having human faults. They are therefore not seen as perfect, but rather are venerated as being wise and powerful. Pagans feel that <b>this</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the gods reflected the dynamics of life on Earth, allowing for the expression of humour.|$|E
25|$|Other transformations {{successfully}} catalyzed by synthetic peptides include hydrocyanation, acylation, conjugate additions, aldehyde-imine couplings, aldol {{reaction and}} bromination. Although {{the nature of}} the transition states is unclear, in many examples small changes in the catalyst structure have dramatic effects on reactivity. It is hypothesized {{that a large number of}} hydrogen bonds both within the peptide and between catalyst and substrate must cooperate to meet the geometrical requirements for successful catalysis. Beyond <b>this,</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> catalyst design and mechanism has not yet progressed beyond requiring the testing of libraries of peptides.|$|E
25|$|Many {{commentators}} have since rejected <b>this</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> Humean empiricism, stressing an epistemological (rather than a semantic) reading of his project. According to this opposing view, Hume's empiricism consisted {{in the idea}} that it is our knowledge, and not our ability to conceive, that is restricted to what can be experienced. Hume thought that we can form beliefs about that which extends beyond any possible experience, through the operation of faculties such as custom and the imagination, but he was sceptical about claims to knowledge on this basis.|$|E

25|$|Although {{natural law}} is often {{confused}} with common law, {{the two are}} distinct. Even though natural law theories have exercised a profound influence {{on the development of}} English common law, the latter is not based on inherent rights, but is the legal tradition whereby certain rights or values are legally recognized by virtue of already having judicial recognition or articulation. Natural law is often contrasted with the human-made laws (positive law) of a given state, political entity or society. In legal theory, the interpretation of a human-made law requires some reference to natural law. On <b>this</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> natural law, natural law can be invoked to criticize judicial decisions about what the law says, but not to criticize the best interpretation of the law itself.|$|E
25|$|As {{human beings}} (Dasein) {{navigate}} their world around them, {{they look for}} tools and ways to accomplish {{what they need to}} do: food and water for survival, instruments to complete tasks, shelter for protection etc. Heidegger theorized that Dasein’s “quest” to exist, so to speak, can only be completed via his relationship with others and his world around him. This is what Slife termed radical relationality: human beings are fundamentally and inescapably relational beings. That human beings exist in-the-world as radically relational beings ultimately means that Dasein must seek out his existence through opportunities that present themselves in his world and through his relationships with others. In other words, what ontological hermeneutics is saying about what nature is that human beings cannot be thought of as merely “self-certain actants” capable of distancing themselves above and against their world effortly to determine rational courses of action, nor as little more than computers that have been programmed to react to stimuli. Instead, all understanding of how to exist comes from being-in-the-world and understanding one’s relation to, or place in, that world. Put another way, human beings conduct themselves within the context of their life-world (the world in which their lives take place) which provides Dasein with possibilities of how to act. It is <b>this</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> himself in that life-world that informs his choice.|$|E
500|$|As {{discussed}} in the Structure and organization section, the hydrophobic attraction of lipid tails in water is the primary force holding lipid bilayers together. Thus, the elastic modulus of the bilayer is primarily determined by how much extra area is exposed to water when the lipid molecules are stretched apart. It is not surprising given <b>this</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the forces involved that {{studies have shown that}} Ka varies strongly with osmotic pressure [...] but only weakly with tail length and unsaturation. Because the forces involved are so small, it is difficult to experimentally determine Ka. Most techniques require sophisticated microscopy and very sensitive measurement equipment.|$|E

500|$|Wellek and Warren {{describe}} the term comparative literature as [...] "troublesome", noting {{that it has}} been used for the study of oral literature, the study of the literatures in two or more countries, and the study of a [...] "general", [...] "universal", or [...] "world" [...] literature; this last use, according to the authors, obviates issues present in the other understandings of the term. <b>This</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> literature as a totality can be used to trace the development of the art, unlimited by differences between languages. Within this comparative literature other supernational literatures, which may be based on language families and schools, are also apparent. There are also national literatures which, although possibly of the same language, will still have thematic differentiations. These are also worthy of study.|$|E
500|$|A {{decade after}} Hovey, the Supreme Court {{announced}} its first rule {{for how the}} Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment would be applied. In Twining v. New Jersey (1908), the Court held that [...] "it {{is possible that some}} of the personal rights safeguarded by the first eight amendments against National action may also be safeguarded against state action, because a denial of them would be a denial of due process of law". <b>This</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the meaning of [...] "due process" [...] opened up the possibility that the Bill of Rights could be applied to the states. Specifically, the Court said in Twining that the test was whether the right was embedded in [...] "the very idea of free government". This test endorsed a [...] "selective incorporation" [...] approach, meaning one that would evaluate whether to apply a right to the states on a case-by-case basis.|$|E

500|$|The Jesuit critic William F. Lynch, who {{believed}} that salvation happens within time and not outside of it, explained what Eliot was attempting {{to do in the}} Four Quartets when he wrote: [...] "it is hard to say no to the impression, if I may use a mixture of my own symbols and his, that the Christian imagination is finally limited to the element of fire, to the day of Pentecost, to the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the disciples. The revelation of eternity and time is of an intersection ... It seems not unseemly to suppose that Eliot's imagination (and is this not a theology?) is alive with points of intersection and of descent." [...] He continued with a focus on how time operated within the poem: [...] "He seems to place our faith, our hope, and our love, not in the flux of time but in the points of time. I am sure his mind is interested in the line and time of Christ, whose Spirit is his total flux. But I am not so sure about his imagination. Is it or is it not an imagination which is saved from time's nausea or terror by points of intersection? ... There seems little doubt that Eliot is attracted above all by the image and the goal of immobility, and that in everything he seeks for approximations to this goal in the human order." [...] Lynch went on to point out that <b>this</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> time includes Asian influences.|$|E
