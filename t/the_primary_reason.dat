5|$|From the 10th century BC onwards, Assyria {{fought for}} control of the {{southern}} Levant. Frequently, cities and kingdoms of the southern Levant appealed to Egypt for aid in their struggles against the powerful Assyrian army. Taharqa enjoyed some initial success in his attempts to regain a foothold in the Near East. Taharqa aided the Judean King Hezekiah when Hezekiah and Jerusalem was besieged by the Assyrian king, Sennacherib. Scholars disagree on <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reason</b> for Assyria's abandonment of their siege on Jerusalem. Reasons for the Assyrian withdrawal range from conflict with the Egyptian/Kushite army to divine intervention to surrender to disease. Henry Aubin argues that the Kushite/Egyptian army saved Jerusalem from the Assyrians and prevented the Assyrians from returning to capture Jerusalem for the remainder of Sennacherib's life (20 years). Some argue that disease was <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reason</b> for failing to actually take the city; however, Senacherib's annals claim Judah was forced into tribute regardless.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Nagas, {{except the}} Naga Epic, Naga Hex, and Naga Hex v2, which {{received}} mixed reviews, {{were met with}} positive reviews from critics. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reason</b> for the Naga Epic's mixed reviews was because of its price, although reviewers liked its wireless capabilities. The main criticism of both the Naga Hex and Naga Hex v2 was {{the arrangement of the}} buttons.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reason</b> {{construction}} halted on {{the four}} ships was the shifting of construction materials and manpower from capital ships to U-boats {{in the last two}} years of the war. The RMA filed a report dated 1 February 1918 stating that capital ship construction had ground to a halt primarily for this reason.|$|E

5|$|Untreated {{streptococcal pharyngitis}} usually {{resolves}} {{within a few}} days. Treatment with antibiotics shortens {{the duration of the}} acute illness by about 16hours. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reason</b> for treatment with antibiotics is {{to reduce the risk of}} complications such as rheumatic fever and retropharyngeal abscesses; antibiotics are effective if given within 9 days of the onset of symptoms.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surrender}} of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reason</b> for manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Col. Alexander, chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Fort Corcoran fell into the third-class category.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surrender}} of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reason</b> for manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Colonel Barton S. Alexander, then-chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Due to its rear-area nature {{and the fact that}} inspections were no longer needed to protect the Long Bridge against sabotage, Fort Jackson fell into the third-class category.|$|E
30|$|The {{nonuniform}} circumferential {{static pressure}} distribution at the volute casing inlet and the vortex structure at the cross-sections were <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reasons</b> for <b>the</b> hydraulic {{loss in the}} volute under the rated and small flow conditions. However, for the large flow condition, the backflow at cross section I and the large velocity gradient from cross section VIII to the throat cross section were <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reasons.</b>|$|R

5|$|Having now gained {{experience}} with the Super Famicom sound chip, Uematsu felt that the sound quality of the soundtrack for the next game in the series, Final Fantasy V (1992), was much better than that of IV. He named this as <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reason</b> that the soundtrack album was two CDs long, a first for the series.

5|$|A {{significant}} change {{at this time}} was that players were no longer required {{to be members of}} the Catholic Young Men's Society. Hibs are not seen today as being an Irish or Roman Catholic institution, {{as it was in the}} early years of its history. For instance, the Irish harp was only re-introduced to the club badge when it was last re-designed in 2000. This design reflects the three pillars of the club's identity: Ireland, Edinburgh (the castle) and Leith (the ship). Geography rather than religion is now seen as <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reason</b> for supporting Hibs, who draw most of their support from the north and east of Edinburgh.|$|E

Owing to its position north of the Potomac River and to {{the small size of}} the fort, Fort Bayard fell into the third-class category, and was abandoned {{a few months after the}} end of the war.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1943 the Axis forces had complete control of the airspace over Yugoslavian territory. No aerial opposition of any kind was expected and that was <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reason</b> that the bomber force could operate without any fighter cover, notwithstanding {{the fact that there}} was a total lack of any serious fighter force in the ZNDH's squadrons. However, the situation started to change by {{the beginning}} of 1943. The Headquarters (HQ) of the ZNDH had plans to re-arm at least one Group with more modern aircraft of German or Italian origin. The Italians refused to supply the requested Macchi C.200 and Macchi C.202 fighters, as the Regia Aeronautica needed every aircraft to fill its own squadrons in {{the beginning of}} 1943.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{centralized}} logistical system, the Polish armies were encumbered {{by large}} baggage trains. To some degree, this was turned into an advantage {{with the development of}} the tabor– military horse-drawn wagons, usually carrying army supplies. The wagon use for defensive formations was perfected by the Cossacks, and to a smaller extent used by other Commonwealth units. The Commonwealth army relied on cavalry, which the nobility saw as a much more respectable type of a troop than the infantry. Despite the reforms of the 17th century, it lost much of its military significance in the 18th century; <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reason</b> for this was a lack of sufficient funding.|$|E

5|$|During the campaign, Kemp's {{endorsement}} {{was highly}} coveted. Forbes {{had tried to}} get Kemp {{to run in the}} 1996 campaign, but Kemp declined and in fact endorsed Forbes just as Dole was closing in on the nomination, and just after Dole gained the endorsements of former contenders Lamar Alexander and Richard Lugar. Some feel <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reason</b> for the endorsement was to keep the flat tax idea and other supply-side views alive. Many thought Kemp had destroyed his own political future with the endorsement, and Kemp profusely apologized to Dole's campaign offices. After it became clear Dole would be the nominee, Kemp attempted to form a bipartisan seminar with Felix Rohatyn to produce a fiscal plan that could be endorsed by both parties.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{preparations}} for the 6th Congress. It was convened a decade after the 5th WPK Congress (in 1970), outside the party norm of a quadrennial meeting. There was no official reason for its postponement, but it was probably {{due to the fact that}} WPK General Secretary Kim Il-sung spent much of the 1970s gathering support (and creating an independent power base) for his son and planned successor Kim Jong-il. In addition, a great deal of time was spent restructuring party organizations and functions. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reason</b> for the 6th Congress was to formalize Kim Jong-il as Kim Il-sung's chosen successor.|$|E
5|$|Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was {{designed}} by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, {{at the level of}} files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional DRM features. MTP {{was designed}} for use with portable media players, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was an evolution of MTP). <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reason</b> for this is that MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.|$|E

5|$|Tourism {{has grown}} in Dorset since the late 18th century {{and is now the}} {{predominant}} industry. It is estimated that 37,500 people work in Dorset's tourism sector. Some 3.2million British and 326,000 foreign tourists visited the county in 2008, staying a total of 15.1 million nights. In addition there were 14.6million day visitors. The combined spending of both groups was £1,458million. Towns received 56% of Dorset's day trippers, 27% went to the coast and 17% to the countryside. A survey carried out in 1997 concluded that <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reason</b> tourists were drawn to Dorset was the attractiveness of the county's coast and countryside. Numbers of domestic and foreign tourists have fluctuated in recent years due to various factors including security and economic downturn, a trend reflected throughout the UK.|$|E
5|$|A Link Between Worlds {{features}} original music {{along with}} tracks from A Link to the Past. Ryo Nagamatsu composed and orchestrated new music for A Link Between Worlds, {{and played the}} flute music featured in the game's milk bar. He also composed arrangements and adapted Koji Kondo's original music from A Link to the Past. Nagamatsu wanted to balance arrangements of past music with completely new music to please both old and new players. He began by revisiting old tracks and thinking how he could best adapt them for A Link Between Worlds soundtrack. He was eager to include choral performances {{as a way to}} add tension to the eerie and unpleasant scenes in the game. Nagamatsu performed the vocals and made use of multitrack recording to layer the different vocals tracks. The audio team decided not use a live orchestra for recording the game's music, <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reason</b> for this was to create optimal sound for the Nintendo 3DS. The reverberations and low-pitch sounds created by a live orchestra were not suitable for the Nintendo 3DS speakers. The majority of the string music was created using a synthesizer, with Toru Minegishi playing guitar on one track.|$|E
5|$|A four-lane divided bypass of Urbana was {{constructed}} for MD 355 in the 2000s. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>reason</b> for constructing the bypass was to relieve traffic heading through the community {{brought on by}} the construction of numerous shopping centers in the area, and the costs for constructing the bypass were entirely paid for by the developers of an area shopping center. The proposal for the bypass called for two roundabouts to control traffic. The first portion of the road opened in late 2005 from MD 355 south to a roundabout at Sugarloaf Parkway. On October 30, 2008, construction began to build the connection of the bypass to MD 355 south of MD 80. The bypass was completed by January 2009, at which point MD355 was realigned onto it and the former alignment became MD355 Bus. In 2013, maintenance of the bypass of MD355 around Urbana was transferred from the developers to the state.|$|E
