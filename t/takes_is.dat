25|$|The most typical form {{which the}} Jesse Tree <b>takes</b> <b>is</b> {{to show the}} figure of Jesse, often larger than all the rest, {{reclining}} or sleeping (perhaps by analogy to Adam when his rib was taken) {{at the foot of}} the pictorial space. From his side or his navel springs the trunk of a tree or vine which ascends, branching to either side. On the branches, usually surrounded by formally scrolling tendrils of foliage, are figures representing the ancestors of Christ. The trunk generally ascends vertically to Mary and then Christ at the top.|$|E

25|$|Before a {{particular}} measurement is performed on a quantum system, the theory usually gives only a probability {{distribution for the}} outcome, and the form that this distribution <b>takes</b> <b>is</b> completely determined by the quantum state and the observable describing the measurement. These probability distributions arise for both mixed states and pure states: it is impossible in quantum mechanics (unlike classical mechanics) to prepare a state in which all properties of the system are fixed and certain. This is exemplified by the uncertainty principle, and reflects a core difference between classical and quantum physics. Even in quantum theory, however, for every observable there are some states that have an exact and determined value for that observable.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{commonly}} held misconception that when flushed, {{the water in}} a toilet bowl swirls one way if the toilet is north of the equator and the other way if south of the equator, due to the Coriolis effect – usually, counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. In reality, the direction that the water <b>takes</b> <b>is</b> much more determined by the direction that the bowl's rim jets are pointed, and it can be made to flush in either direction in either hemisphere by simply redirecting the rim jets during manufacture. On the scale of bathtubs and toilets, the Coriolis effect is too weak to be observed except under carefully controlled laboratory conditions.|$|E
25|$|A {{very popular}} modern subgenre {{consists}} {{of stories that}} treat werewolves as separate race or species (either science fictional or magical) or as persons using magic in order to deliberately transform into wolves at will. Such current-day werewolf fiction almost exclusively involves lycanthropy being either a hereditary condition or being transmitted like a disease by the bite of another werewolf. The form a werewolf <b>takes</b> <b>is</b> not always an ordinary wolf, but is often anthropomorphic or may be otherwise larger and more powerful than an ordinary wolf. Sometimes the beast form of the werewolf will have some physical characteristics borrowed from an animal species other than the wolf, {{as can be seen}} in the boar-like werewolf of Wild Country (2006). Many modern werewolves are also supposedly immune to damage caused by ordinary weapons, being vulnerable only to silver objects (usually a bullet or blade). This negative reaction to silver is sometimes so strong that the mere touch of the metal on a werewolf's skin will cause burns.|$|E

500|$|Although {{each of the}} film's key puppets {{required}} a small team of puppeteers to operate it, the most complex puppet of the production was Hoggle. Shari Weiser was inside the costume, while Hoggle's face was radio-controlled by Brian Henson and three other operators. Speaking in the Inside the Labyrinth documentary, Brian Henson explained that Weiser [...] "does all the body movement and her head is inside the head. However, the jaw is not connected to her jaw. Nothing that the face is doing has any connection with what she's doing with her face. The other {{four members of the}} crew are all radio crew, myself included." [...] Speaking of the challenges involved with performing Hoggle, Brian Henson said, [...] "five performers trying to get one character out of one puppet was a very tough thing.

Executive producer David Mirkin describes Brooks as [...] "really weird to direct" [...] because [...] "almost {{every one of his}} <b>takes</b> <b>is</b> flawless, but each one has different material. He makes up the stuff as he goes." [...] He uses a combination of the jokes in the script and his own material and because many of his takes are different, it is difficult for the producers to decide which lines to use.

500|$|John Kinnaird later {{commented on}} Hazlitt's words terming Iago [...] "an amateur of tragedy in real life", {{pointing}} out that Bradley and others after him developed the idea that Hazlitt saw Iago as an artist in his own right, [...] "a dramatic artist manqué". [...] "But the form Iago's will to 'mischief' <b>takes</b> <b>is</b> not primarily aesthetic or creative but practical and critical. Soldier that he is, he has a 'craving after action {{of the most difficult}} and dangerous kind,' and he has none of the artist's sympathy with pleasure; his 'licentious' bent is always 'saturnine,' and stems from 'a desire of finding out the worst side of every thing, and of proving himself an over-match for appearances' [...] ". David Bromwich later warned against carrying too far the idea that Iago is an artist figure within the play, a representation of Shakespeare himself, as Iago's [...] "genius is [...] the opposite of Shakespeare's.

[...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian mused that the track seemed ambitious {{to the point of}} sounding slightly daft, and that the track was [...] "certainly unlike anything else in current R" [...] PopMatterss Brice Ezell stated that all it <b>takes</b> <b>is</b> one listen to 'Pyramids', the shape-shifting opus of channel ORANGE to cement Ocean’s status as one of contemporary R vital songwriters.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} script, the Breaking Bad staff decided {{early on that}} Gus would not speak much during the scene because they felt it was more {{dramatic}} that way and more appropriate for his character. Esposito felt the scene was a pivotal moment not only for his character, but for Gus' relationship with Walter, and a warning that Walter should continue to operate Gus' way or risk death. Regarding his character's murder of Victor, Esposito said: [...] "This had to be done. Someone did something, they got seen. ... It was about survival. This had to be done, but I {{could do it in}} a way that also sent a message to the people who weren't listening." [...] Bryan Cranston said he was not expecting the episode to take the direction it did. He called the scene [...] "painful, but beautifully crafted, and reasonably so", and commented on the contrast between Gus' calm demeanor and Walter's [...] "tap-dancing to stay alive". Cranston said of Esposito's performance, [...] "When he plays that bad character, his eyes go dead, and all it <b>takes</b> <b>is</b> to look into his eyes." [...] Gilligan said although Gus' actions in the scene were scripted, [...] "You'd be surprised how little I talked to Giancarlo about how he played that part ...

500|$|Canadian Senator Douglas Roche, O.C., {{argues in}} The Case for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly that even an {{indirectly}} elected UNPA consisting of delegates appointed by national parliaments could create additional {{checks and balances}} by providing for oversight by a parliamentary body that would be independent of member nations' executive branches. It would open up the global policymaking process to a larger group of elected officials by shifting some power from the relatively small executive branches of countries to the larger legislative branches. According to Roche, globalization has tended to increase {{the power of the}} executive branch while marginalizing the legislative branch; for instance, U.S. Presidents since George H. W. Bush have been given [...] authority to negotiate trade agreements, subject to a [...] "yea or nay" [...] scrutiny by the U.S. Congress on the negotiated deal. A Property and Environment Research Center report argues that changes in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are another example of how international regulation removes checks and balances between the branches of government: [...] "The OECD was created by a 1961 treaty, ratified by the U.S. Senate, to help achieve economic growth. In April 1998, a ministerial meeting reinterpreted the treaty, adding social and environmental considerations to the economic ones. The United States executive branch agreed to the changes, but the Senate had no opportunity to debate this treaty, even though it was significantly different from the 1961 treaty. The executive branch had essentially negotiated a new deal without Senate approval." [...] World Federalist Canada Briefing Paper No. 30, however, suggests that UNPA proposals may spark opposition from the executive branches that stand to lose power: [...] "Experience has shown that civil servants and diplomats working in national foreign ministries are less likely to support or see the need for a UNPA. They view the UN as a forum for discussion among sovereign states; whatever action the UN <b>takes</b> <b>is</b> a result of bargaining and compromise among member states".|$|E
