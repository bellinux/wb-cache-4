5|$|Artavasdes I was a {{son-in-law}} of King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene and his wife, Isias Philostorgos, as {{he married}} one of <b>their</b> <b>daughters</b> Athenais, a Princess from Commagene who was of Armenian and Greek descent.

5|$|Although {{the ideal}} ages for {{marriage}} were thirty {{for a man}} and twenty for a woman, it was common for a male to marry at age sixteen and a female at age fourteen. To encourage families to marry off <b>their</b> <b>daughters,</b> a law was introduced in 189 BCE that increased the poll tax rate fivefold for unmarried {{women between the ages}} of fifteen and thirty. People of the Han practiced a strict form of exogamy where one could not marry a person who had the same surname, even if both partners could not be traced back to a common ancestor (however, this excluded the royal family, who sometimes married distant relatives for political reasons). Officials often married into families with officials of equal status and sometimes married royal princesses or had <b>their</b> <b>daughters</b> marry kings and even the emperor.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a family}} of British nobility, she came to {{prominence}} in 1923 when she married the Duke of York, the second son of King George V and Queen Mary. The couple and <b>their</b> <b>daughters</b> embodied traditional ideas of family and public service. She undertook a variety of public engagements and became known for her consistently cheerful countenance.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, it {{was found}} that {{families}} failed to seek medical treatment for <b>their</b> <b>daughters</b> because of the stigma associated with negative medical histories. A study conducted by Pednekar et al. in 2011 found that out of 100 boys and girls with congenital heart disease, 70 boys would have an operation while only 22 girls will receive similar treatment.|$|E

5|$|Health {{professionals}} are often involved in Egypt, Kenya, Indonesia and Sudan. In Egypt 77 percent of FGM procedures, and in Indonesia over 50 percent, were performed by medical professionals as of 2008 and 2016. Women in Egypt reported in 1995 that a local anaesthetic {{had been used}} on <b>their</b> <b>daughters</b> in 60 percent of cases, a general anaesthetic in 13 percent and neither in 25 percent (two percent were missing/don't know).|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Anastasia and {{her family}} were canonized as passion bearers by the Russian Orthodox Church. The family had {{previously}} been canonized in 1981 by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad as holy martyrs.

5|$|Outside, Cavaldi survives, having donned the Grimm's faux-magic armor. He finds Will's {{body and}} recites an Italian curse, and the tower falls apart. Jake escapes, and Cavaldi informs Jake {{that he can}} break the spell and awaken Angelika with a kiss, which in turn resurrects the other girls and Will. With the menace gone and <b>their</b> <b>daughters</b> {{returned}} to them, the villagers of Marbaden celebrate and give their heart-felt thanks to the brothers.|$|E
5|$|The Islamic {{principle}} of kafa'a discourages the marriages {{of women to}} men of differing religion or of inferior status. Neighbouring Muslim powers did not start to give <b>their</b> <b>daughters</b> in marriage to Ottoman princes until the fifteenth century, when they were seen to have grown in importance. This same principle meant that, while Ottoman men were free to marry Christian women, Muslim princesses were prevented from marrying Christian princes.|$|E
5|$|A {{report in}} 1997 {{described}} use of sponges {{as a tool}} by bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay in Western Australia. A dolphin will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum, which is presumably then used to protect it when searching for food in the sandy sea bottom. The behavior, known as sponging, has only been observed in this bay, and is almost exclusively shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behavior to <b>their</b> <b>daughters,</b> and that all the sponge-users are closely related, suggesting {{that it is a}} fairly recent innovation.|$|E

5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for <b>their</b> <b>daughters.</b> When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for <b>their</b> <b>daughters.</b> When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E
5|$|Born at Rangiaowhia, near Te Awamutu, on 8 July 1874, Cunningham {{was the son}} of Hera (Sarah) Ngaihika Halbert and {{her second}} husband, James Cunningham.

Hera later remarried Paratene Tatae, a cousin of Te Kooti: <b>their</b> <b>daughters</b> included Reremoana Hakiwai, and Keita Kaikiri Paratene, who married Reweti Tuhorouta Kohere.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of his father in 1894, Riley began regretting his choice not to marry or have children. To {{compensate}} for the lack of his own children, he became a doting uncle, showering gifts on his nieces and nephews. He had repurchased his childhood home in 1893 and allowed his divorced sister, Mary, his widowed sister-in-law, Julia, and <b>their</b> <b>daughters</b> to live in the home. He provided for all their needs and spent the summer months of 1893 living with them. He took his nephew Edmund Eital as a personal secretary and gave him a $50,000 wedding gift in 1912. Riley was well loved by his family.|$|E

5|$|George and {{his father}} sailed for England from The Hague on 16/27 September 1714 and arrived at Greenwich two days later. The {{following}} day, they formally entered London in a ceremonial procession. George was given the title of Prince of Wales. Caroline followed her husband to Britain in October with <b>their</b> <b>daughters,</b> while Frederick remained in Hanover to be brought up by private tutors. London was like nothing George had seen before: it was 50 times larger than Hanover, and the crowd was estimated at up to {{one and a half}} million spectators. George courted popularity with voluble expressions of praise for the English, and claimed that he had no drop of blood that was not English.|$|E
5|$|Like Ladislaus I, Coloman {{proved to}} be a great legislator, but he {{prescribed}} less severe punishments than his uncle had done. He ordered that transactions between Christians and Jews were to be put into writing. His laws concerning his Muslim subjects aimed at their conversion, for instance, by obliging them to marry <b>their</b> <b>daughters</b> to Christians. The presence of Jewish and Muslim merchants in the kingdom was due to its role as a crossroad of trading routes leading towards Constantinople, Regensburg and Kiev. Local trade also existed, which enabled Coloman to collect the marturina, the traditional in-kind tax of Slavonia, in cash.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{groups may}} split {{up when they}} become so large that {{competition}} for resources is problematic, but even then, members of matrilines tend to stick together. Dominant females procure more food, matings, and supporters. Among olive baboons in Tanzania, high-ranking females give birth at shorter intervals to infants with a higher survival rate, and <b>their</b> <b>daughters</b> tend to mature faster than low-ranking females. However, these high-ranking females also {{appear to have a}} higher probability of miscarriages and some high-ranking matrilines have inexplicably low fertility. One theory suggests this occurs due to stress on the high-ranking females, although this theory is controversial.|$|E
