5|$|Early in the Society's history, {{when its}} focus was still {{primarily}} literary, membership was considered {{by a committee}} {{for three days and}} then voted upon. By 1908, <b>that</b> <b>model</b> had been abandoned in favor of an open system in which any student who paid an annual fee could be part of the group. At that time, Philaletheis was governed by a six-member board consisting of a president and vice-president (both seniors), secretary, treasurer, and props manager (juniors), and an assistant props manager (a sophomore). In 1951, the board was vastly expanded to include managers of scenery, lights, sound, makeup, publicity, {{and a number of other}} fields.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} measure {{well-being}} more generally, Amartya Sen, Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, and other feminist economists helped develop alternatives to Gross Domestic Product, {{such as the}} Human Development Index. Other models of interest to feminist economists include the labor theory of value, which was most thoroughly developed in Das Capital by Karl Marx. <b>That</b> <b>model</b> considers production as a socially constructed human project and redefines wages as means to earning a living. This refocuses economic models on human innate desires and needs as opposed to monetary incentives.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to suggest <b>that</b> <b>models</b> in {{scientific}} practice can be conceived of as epistemic artefacts. Approaching models this way accommodates many such things that working scientists themselves call models but which the semantic conception of models does not duly recognize as such. <b>That</b> <b>models</b> are epistemic artefacts implies, firstly, that they cannot be understood apart from purposeful human activity. Secondly, it implies that they are somehow materialized inhabitants of the intersubjective field of human activity. Thirdly, it implies <b>that</b> <b>models</b> can function also as knowledge objects. We argue <b>that</b> <b>models</b> as epistemic artefacts give knowledge in many other ways than just via direct representative links. To substantiate our view we use an example of a language-technological artefact, a parser...|$|R

5|$|Martin, Odlyzko, and Wolfram {{investigate}} pseudoforests <b>that</b> <b>model</b> {{the dynamics}} of cellular automata. These functional graphs, which they call state transition diagrams, have one vertex for each possible configuration that the ensemble of cells of the automaton can be in, and an edge connecting each configuration to the configuration that follows it according to the automaton's rule. One can infer properties of the automaton from the structure of these diagrams, such {{as the number of}} components, length of limiting cycles, depth of the trees connecting non-limiting states to these cycles, or symmetries of the diagram. For instance, any vertex with no incoming edge corresponds to a Garden of Eden pattern and a vertex with a self-loop corresponds to a still life pattern.|$|E
5|$|Model {{chose to}} make his initial attacks using {{infantry}} divisions reinforced with assault guns and heavy tanks, and supported by artillery and the Luftwaffe. In doing so he sought to maintain the armoured strength of his panzer divisions {{to be used for}} exploitation once the Red Army defences were breached. Once a breakthrough had been achieved the panzer forces would move through and advance towards Kursk. Jan Möschen, a major in Model's staff, later commented <b>that</b> <b>Model</b> expected a breakthrough on the second day. If a breakthrough did occur the briefest delay in bringing up the panzer divisions would give the Red Army time to react. His corps commanders thought a breakthrough extremely unlikely.|$|E

5|$|When {{interpreted}} as a proof within a first-order set theory, such as ZFC, Dedekind's categoricity proof for PA shows that each model of set theory has a unique model of the Peano axioms, up to isomorphism, that embeds as an initial segment of all other models of PA contained within <b>that</b> <b>model</b> of set theory.

UW President Glenn Frank had warned of decreased enrollment in August 1928 and of its consequences for the college. UW College of Letters and Science Dean George Sellery offered support conditional on codified discipline and uniform final exams, which Meiklejohn refused. Sellery later refused to allow transfer students into the college. Meiklejohn wrote letters to Wisconsin high schools in April 1929 that acknowledged the college's stereotypes and welcomed demographic change, but the campaign backfired. He sent an adviser to tour the state and solve {{what he saw as}} a communication issue. The adviser found high school seniors largely interested in vocational training, and that the prospect of traditional college excited students {{to the point where they}} did not consider improvements upon <b>that</b> <b>model.</b> The adviser found students uninterested in the Experimental College's prospects.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President {{is divided}} into four chapters, the first two of which {{summarize}} the Bible from a New Monastic perspective. The summary of the Old Testament argues that the Israelites had a unique political philosophy, but that they {{failed to live up}} to its implications. The New Testament summary considers Jesus' politics and the qualities of the Christian Church. The third chapter suggests implications of this narrative for citizens of the United States, who the authors describe as members of an empire similar to that of the Romans. This chapter argues that the Book of Revelation has more to do with living faithfully in an evil empire than with eschatology. The chapter also asserts that Constantinianism had generally negative consequences for the Church. The fourth chapter tells of Christians living in countercultural ways <b>that</b> <b>model</b> divine redemption towards others. Other stories involve heterodox economics, defending the homeless, Amish forgiveness, dumpster diving, missional robotics, Martin Luther King Jr., anti-war protests, and The Simple Way.|$|E
40|$|This paper asks how, {{in science}} {{in general and}} in {{economics}} in particular, theoretical models aid the understanding of real-world phenomena. Using specific models in economics and biology as test cases, it considers three alternative answers: <b>that</b> <b>models</b> are tools for isolating the ‘capacities’ of causal factors in the real world; <b>that</b> <b>modelling</b> is ‘conceptual exploration’ which ultimately contributes {{to the development of}} genuinely explanatory theories; and <b>that</b> <b>models</b> are credible counterfactual worlds from which inductive inferences can be made. The paper argues that the ‘credible worlds’ account captures significant aspects of scientific practice, even if many modellers see their work as conceptual exploration...|$|R

5|$|The genus Carcharocles {{currently}} contains four species: C. auriculatus, C. angustidens, C. chubutensis, and C. megalodon. The genus {{was proposed}} by D. S. Jordan and H.

Before this, in 1960, the genus Procarcharodon was erected by French ichthyologist Edgard Casier, which included those four sharks and was considered separate from the great white shark. It is now considered a junior synonym of Carcharocles. The genus Palaeocarcharodon was erected alongside Procarcharodon to represent {{the beginning of the}} lineage, and, in the model wherein megalodon and the great white shark are closely related, their last common ancestor. However, it is believed to be an evolutionary dead-end and unrelated to the Carcharocles sharks by authors who reject <b>that</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E
