60|$|The {{first day}} the lads succeeded {{in finding out}} nothing which could give any countenance to {{suspicion}} that treachery was intended. They had agreed to work separately, and each mingled among the groups of citizens and soldiers, where the council was the general topic of conversation. There was much wonder and speculation as to the object for which the governor had summoned it, and as to the terms which he {{might be expected to}} propound, but to none did the idea of treachery or foul play in any way occur; and when at night they left the town and sent off their message to Archie, the lads could only say that all seemed fair and honest, and that none either of the townspeople or soldiers appeared to have the least expectation of trouble arising at the council. The following morning they agreed that Jock should hang round the building in which the council was to be held, and where preparations for the meeting and for a banquet which was afterwards to take place were being made, while Cluny should continue his inquiries within the walls. Jock hid away his basket and joined those looking on at the preparations. Green boughs were being carried in for decorating the walls, tables, and benches for the banquet. These were brought from the town in country carts, and a party of soldiers under the command of an officer carried them in and arranged them. Several of the rustics looking on gave their aid in carrying in the tables, in order that they might take home to their wives an account of the appearance of the place where the grand council was to be held. Jock thrust himself forward, and seizing a bundle of green boughs, entered the barn. Certainly there was nothing here to justify any suspicions. The soldiers were laughing and joking as they made the arrangements; clean rushes lay piled against a wall in readiness <b>to</b> <b>strew</b> <b>over</b> the floor at the last moment; boughs had been nailed against the walls, and the tables and benches were sufficient to accommodate a considerable number. Several times Jock passed in and out, but still without gathering a word to excite his suspicions. Presently Arlouf himself, a powerful man with a forbidding countenance, rode up and entered the barn. He approached the officer in command of the preparations; and Jock, pretending to be busy in carrying his boughs, managed to keep near so as to catch something of their conversation.|$|E
5000|$|The Gypsy Queen, Matilda Stanley, died in Vicksburg, Mississippi in January 1878 {{after an}} illness of two years, {{and her body}} was embalmed {{so that it was}} said to [...] "retain the natural aspect of life." [...] It was placed in the Woodland {{receiving}} vault in Dayton, and every day members of late Queen's family came with fresh flowers <b>to</b> <b>strew</b> <b>over</b> her. Eight months later her funeral was held, giving time for word to spread and her people to travel to Dayton, and she was interred in the Stanley family plot. Twenty-thousand paid their last tribute to the dead Queen, including a dozen chiefs and their tribes from different sections of the United States, Canada and England.|$|E
60|$|Xerxes then {{commanded}} {{that a great}} hole {{should be}} dug, and ordered all {{the bodies of the}} Persians that had been killed to be buried in it, except only about a thousand, which he left upon the ground. The object of this was to conceal the extent of the loss which his army had sustained. The more perfectly to accomplish this end, he caused the great grave, when it was filled up, <b>to</b> be <b>strewed</b> <b>over</b> with leaves, so as to cover and conceal all indications of what had been done. This having been carefully effected, he sent the message to the fleet, which was alluded to {{at the close of the}} last chapter, inviting the officers to come and view the ground.|$|R
6000|$|I {{know well}} the common censure by which {{objections}} to such futilities of so-called education are met, {{by the men}} who have been ruined by them,--the common plea that anything does to [...] "exercise the mind upon." [...] It is an utterly false one. The human soul, in youth, is not a machine of which you can polish the cogs with any kelp or brickdust near at hand; and, having got it into working order, and good, empty, and oiled serviceableness, start your immortal locomotive at twenty-five years old or thirty, express from the Strait Gate, on the Narrow Road. The whole period of youth is one essentially of formation, edification, instruction, I use the words with their weight in them; intaking of stores, establishment in vital habits, hopes and faiths. There is not an hour of it but is trembling with destinies,--not a moment of which, once past, the appointed work can ever be done again, or the neglected blow struck on the cold iron. Take your vase of Venice glass out of the furnace, and <b>strew</b> chaff <b>over</b> it in its transparent heat, and recover that to its clearness and rubied glory when the north wind has blown upon it; but do not think <b>to</b> <b>strew</b> chaff <b>over</b> the child fresh from God's presence, and to bring the heavenly colors back to him--at least in this world.|$|R
5000|$|Georgiana Cavendish, 5th Duchess of Devonshire died on 30 March 1806, at 3:30, {{at the age}} of 48. She was {{surrounded}} by her husband, the 5th Duke of Devonshire; her mother, Countess Spencer; her sister, Countess of Bessborough; her eldest daughter, Lady Morph (who was eight months pregnant); and Lady Elizabeth Foster. They were all said to have been inconsolable over her death. For the first time, the duke showed moving emotion towards his late wife, as a contemporary wrote, [...] "The Duke has been most deeply affected and has shown more feeling than anyone thought possible--indeed every individual in the family are in a dreadful state of affliction." [...] The late duchess's eldest daughter furthermore poured out her feelings, [...] "Oh my beloved, my adored departed mother, are you indeed forever parted from me--Shall I see no more that angelic countenance or that blessed voice--You whom I loved with such tenderness, you who were the [...] [...] [...] best of mothers, Adieu--I wanted <b>to</b> <b>strew</b> violets <b>over</b> her dying bed as she <b>strewed</b> sweets <b>over</b> my life but they would not let me." [...] Her distant cousin, Charles James Fox, for whom she had triumphantly campaigned, was noted to have cried. The Prince of Wales himself lamented, [...] "The best natured and the best bred woman in England is gone." [...] Thousands of the people of London congregated at Piccadily, where the Cavendish home in the city was located, to mourn her. She was buried at the family vault at All Saints Parish Church (now Derby Cathedral) in Derby.|$|R

60|$|Maupassant's renown is universal, but his {{popularity}} is restricted. It {{is not difficult}} to perceive why. Maupassant is an intensely national writer. He is so intensely national in his logic, in his clearness, in his aesthetic and moral conceptions, that he has been accepted by his countrymen without having had to pay the tribute of flattery either to the nation as a whole, or to any class, sphere or division of the nation. The truth of his art tells with an irresistible force; and he stands excused from the duty of patriotic posturing. He is a Frenchman of Frenchmen beyond question or cavil, and with that he is simple enough to be universally comprehensible. What is wanting to his universal success is the mediocrity of an obvious and appealing tenderness. He neglects to qualify his truth with the drop of facile sweetness; he forgets <b>to</b> <b>strew</b> paper roses <b>over</b> the tombs. The disregard of these common decencies lays him open to the charges of cruelty, cynicism, hardness. And yet it can be safely affirmed that this man wrote from the fulness of a compassionate heart. He is merciless and yet gentle with his mankind; he does not rail at their prudent fears and their small artifices; he does not despise their labours. It seems to me that he looks with an eye of profound pity upon their troubles, deceptions and misery. But he looks at them all. He sees--and does not turn away his head. As a matter of fact he is courageous.|$|R
