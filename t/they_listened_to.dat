This was probably unnecessary, as someone with her skills—she {{was one of the few}} physicists who had experience with a Cockcroft-Walton accelerator—would have been quickly snapped up at Los Alamos. At the time of the Trinity nuclear test in 1945, Elizabeth was seven months pregnant with her first child. Graves therefore requested that they be assigned to a post far from the blast. <b>They</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> Samuel K.

25|$|Evangelical Baptist and Methodist preachers {{traveled}} {{throughout the}} South in the Great Awakening {{of the late}} 18th century. They appealed directly to slaves, and a few thousand slaves converted. Blacks found opportunities to have active roles in new congregations, especially in the Baptist Church, where slaves were appointed as leaders and preachers. (They were excluded from such roles in the Anglican or Episcopal Church.) As <b>they</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> readings, slaves developed their own interpretations of the Scriptures and found inspiration in stories of deliverance, such as the Exodus out of Egypt. Nat Turner, a slave and Baptist preacher, was inspired to armed rebellion, in an uprising that killed about 50 white men, women, and children in Virginia.|$|E

25|$|The {{cocktail}} party effect is the phenomenon {{that a person}} hears his or her name even when not attending to the conversation. To study this, a screening measure for attentional control was given that tested a person’s ability {{to keep track of}} words while also doing math problems. Participants were separated into two groups---low and high span attentional control ability groups. <b>They</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> two word lists read simultaneously by a male and a female voice and were told to ignore the male voice. Their name was read by the “ignored” male voice. Low span people were more likely to hear their name compared to high span people. This result suggests that people with lower attentional control ability have more trouble inhibiting information from the surrounding environment.|$|E
25|$|After {{making the}} {{necessary}} preparations, Jones sailed for France on November 1, 1777, with orders {{to assist the}} American cause however possible. The American commissioners in France were Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane, and Arthur Lee, and <b>they</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> Jones's strategic recommendations. They promised him the command of , a new vessel being constructed for America in Amsterdam. Britain, however, was able to divert L'Indien away from American hands by exerting pressure to ensure its sale to France instead (which had not yet allied with America). Jones was again left without a command, an unpleasant reminder of his stagnation in Boston from late 1776 until early 1777. It is thought that during this time Jones developed his close friendship with Benjamin Franklin, whom he greatly admired.|$|E

We were interested {{to find out how}} music effects them positively and negatively. We chose to interview 14 students attending middle- and highschool, both girls and boys, to find out how youths <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> music and how they perceive that music effects them. We concluded in our interview study that youths <b>listen</b> extensively <b>to</b> music. We could clearly see that our informants use music in different ways. Many informants use music to enhance their feelings and many use music to increase their ability to concentrate. It is also evident that the informants use different kinds of music for different situations and contexts, for example when they are sad <b>they</b> want <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> happy music or when they are doing sports <b>they</b> want <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> music with a high tempo to endure and to want more.

O'Rourke invited Glenn Kotche, a drummer who played in a similar musical style, to the practice session. Tweedy found lyrical inspiration from word exercises; for example, he picked out random words from a copy of TV Guide and formed abstract lines such as [...] "you boil hearts and discuss birds". He also sought to improve as a guitarist, taking influence from free jazz artists such as James [...] "Blood" [...] Ulmer.|$|E
