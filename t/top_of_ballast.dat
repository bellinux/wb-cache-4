30|$|The {{longitudinal}} {{tensile strain}} obtained for section T 4 was 4.136 με, {{which is the}} minimum among the four structures. The time-history curve of T 4 (Fig.  8 a) shows that the strain was mainly a compressive strain. However, the maximum transversal tensile strain was about 61.222 με, which was almost twice than the corresponding values of other three structures. This reveals that the trackbed with asphalt layer at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> trackbed mainly experiences transversal tensile stress while being compressed in longitudinal direction, {{which is similar to}} being in the state of simple tensile stress and is adverse to the long-term performance of asphalt layer.|$|E
5000|$|In {{submarine}} technology a vent [...] is a valve {{fitted to}} the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a submarine's <b>ballast</b> tanks to let air {{escape from the}} <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ballast</b> tank and be replaced by water entering through the opening(s) called [...] "flood ports" [...] or [...] "floods" [...] {{at the bottom of}} the tank. In earlier times, the openings at the bottom <b>of</b> the <b>ballast</b> tank were fitted with valves known as Kingston valves. These valves were eliminated in the U.S. Navy between the World Wars.|$|R
50|$|Submerging is done {{by opening}} the vents in the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ballast</b> tanks, as well as opening the valves in the bottom. This allows water to flood into the tank, and allows the air already present inside the tank to escape through the top vents. as the air escapes from the tank, the vessel's {{buoyancy}} decreases, thus causing it to sink. In order for the submarine to surface, the vents in the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ballast</b> tanks are shut, and compressed air is allowed into the tanks. The high-pressure air pocket pushes the water out through the bottom valves and increases the vessel's buoyancy, causing it to rise. A submarine may have several types <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> tank: the main ballast tanks, which are the main tanks used for diving and surfacing, and trimming tanks, which are used to adjust the submarine's attitude (its 'trim') both {{on the surface and}} when underwater.|$|R
50|$|When on {{the surface}} a submarine's ballast tanks are filled with air which gives the vessel its {{buoyancy}} and {{in order for the}} submarine to submerge water is taken into the ballast tanks through the flood ports {{at the bottom of the}} tanks, effacing this excess buoyancy. As the ballast tanks contain air when {{on the surface}} it is necessary to allow this air to escape, so that water may then enter the tanks, and this air is allowed to escape via the opened vents in the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ballast</b> tanks.|$|R
50|$|On vintage submarines, Kingston valves are fitted at {{the bottom}} <b>of</b> certain <b>ballast</b> tanks, such as safety, negative, and bow {{buoyancy}} tanks. The submarine's ballast tank valves are used to admit water when the submarine dives. The valves allow water to enter the ballast tanks, while the enclosed air escapes through the open main vents at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ballast</b> tanks. During peacetime the Kingston valves are closed when the submarine is on the surface, the valves and vents being opened to dive, but to reduce the time required for diving in wartime the Kingston valves are left permanently open when at sea, the water being kept out <b>of</b> the <b>ballast</b> tanks by the air pressure of the trapped air. This pressure is released when the vents are opened for diving, allowing the water to enter through the open Kingston valves.|$|R

40|$|The {{foundation}} <b>of</b> <b>ballasted</b> railway {{is usually}} {{consisted of a}} graded layer of granular media <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> placed above naturally deposited subgrade. The ballast layer is responsible for limiting the vertical stress magnitudes applied to the weaker subgrade and also prevents the vertical and lateral train-induced sleeper movements. In recent years, the progressive use of faster and heavier trains has compromised the ability <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> to resist such movements due to the increased magnitude <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage (degradation). Therefore, accurate determination <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage is important. The amount <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage can be estimated by comparing the gradation (particle size distribution) curves of fresh and degraded ballast, using a ballast breakage index. However, the Australian railway authorities currently rely on the visual inspection for estimating ballast breakage. Despite {{the fact that the}} visual inspection is convenient, as it does not require transport <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> samples or testing, it is subjective and can lead to uneconomical maintenance cycles. In this paper, an attempt is made to utilise the digital imaging technique for gradation analysis and breakage estimation <b>of</b> <b>ballast.</b> The technique is fast and convenient, and can be applied to both the laboratory and field conditions, hence, can be used successfully to replace the visual inspection <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage...|$|R

40|$|Impact loads {{generated}} because of wheel and rail defects cause accelerated ballast breakage leading to adverse performance <b>of</b> <b>ballasted</b> rail tracks. In the present study, experimental and numerical investigations {{have been carried}} out to develop an understanding of the performance of shock mats in the attenuation of dynamic impact loads and subsequent mitigation <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> degradation. The investigations include different locations of shock mats considering stiff and weak subgrade conditions. With the provision of shock mats, the magnitude of impact forces decreases, and the time duration of impact ges prolonged. In the case of stiff subgrade, the efficiency of the shock mat in reducing the impact forces is greater when it is located at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> rather than at the top, whereas the reverse is true for weak subgrade. However, the provision of shock mats both at the <b>top</b> and bottom <b>of</b> the <b>ballast</b> bed, irrespective <b>of</b> the subgrade condition, is the best solution for minimising the impact force.

40|$|The {{composition}} of a black, tar like thermal dielectric compound {{found that the}} Miamitown Grade School (SIC- 8210), Miamitown, Ohio was investigated. The school principal requested the study after expressing concern that the compound, which had leaked from several fluorescent lamp ballast casings, might contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). On December 7, 1981, a wipe sample was collected and analyzed. The surface of a luminaire where the ballast had previously burned out contained 3600 micrograms of PCB which was reported as Aroclor- 1242 (53469219). Other samples contained 0. 9 and 0. 6 micrograms of PCB per 100 square centimeters. The ballasts may have inadequate internal thermal protective mechanisms to prevent overheating and ultimate burnout, {{both of which are}} causes of leakage of the thermal dielectric compound. The author concludes that significant quantities of PCBs were released during ballast burnout. The author suggests that thermally unprotected ballasts be replaced with thermally protected units of Class-P classification. On December 4, 1981, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) was requested to determine if the thermal-dielectric compound that had leaked from several fluorescent lamp ballast casings contained polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). On December 7, 1 b 1. bulk solid and wipe samples were obtained to determine the presence of PCBs. A sample of the thermal-dielectric compound obtained from the surface of a luminaire in the cafeteria (where a ballast had previously burned-out) contained 3600 micrograms of PCB (reported as Aroclor 1 4). Samples obtained from the <b>top</b> surfaces <b>of</b> <b>ballasts</b> from the Art Room and Principal 27 s Office contained 0. 9 and 0. 6 micrograms of PCB per 100 square centimeters (reported as Aroclor 1260), respectively. These results indicate that the ballasts tested may have inadequate internal thermal protective mechanisms to prevent overheating and ultimate burnout, both of which are causes of leakage of the thermal-dielectric compound from the fluorescent lamp ballasts. Based upon the health effects associated with exposure to PCBs and studies demonstrating that significant quantities of PCBs are released during ballast burnout, NIOSH recommends replacement <b>of</b> thermally unprotected <b>ballasts</b> with thermally protected units of Class P classification before burnouts occur.
