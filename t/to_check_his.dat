5|$|The {{government}} may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable and articulable suspicion, {{with a few}} exceptions. In Delaware v. Prouse (1979), the Court ruled an officer has made an illegal seizure when he stops an automobile and detains the driver in order <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>his</b> driver's license and the registration of the automobile, unless the officer has articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered, or either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law.|$|E
5|$|Both Newt Lee, {{after the}} {{discovery}} of Phagan's body, and the police, just after 4a.m., had unsuccessfully tried to telephone Frank early on Sunday, April 27. The police contacted him later that morning and he agreed to accompany them to the factory. When the police arrived after 7a.m. without telling the specifics of {{what happened at the}} factory, Frank seemed extremely nervous, trembling, and pale; his voice was hoarse, and he was rubbing his hands and asking questions before the police could answer. Frank said he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>his</b> payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.|$|E
5|$|Drawing {{inspiration}} from the Mario series, Yoshizawa kept the same title but changed everything else; it became a platformer {{as opposed to a}} beat 'em up such as Double Dragon; the gameplay was modeled after Konami's Castlevania, with Ryu being equipped with a katana-like Dragon Sword, shurikens, and ninpo techniques such as fire wheels. In designing the protagonist Ryu Hayabusa, the development team wanted him to be unique from other ninjas. They designed him with a ninja vest in order to place emphasis on his muscles, and they furnished him with a cowl that arched outward. They originally wanted to equip Ryu with sensors and a helmet with an inside monitor <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>his</b> surroundings, but that idea was scrapped. According to Kato, they utilized specific locations and environments to justify the need for having a ninja for a main character.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} setting, the player guides Harry Mason in an over-the-shoulder view as he {{searches}} for his missing daughter Cheryl in the snowy town of Silent Hill. Harry {{is equipped with}} a smartphone and flashlight: he can use the phone <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>his</b> location on a Global Positioning System map, take photographs, and make telephone calls. Moving to certain spots with high interference, represented by a lot of radio noise, or by taking pictures of spots where shadowy figures can be seen, unlock various text and voicemail messages that expand the story and occasionally provide clues. To view the details of various documents, the player can zoom in on objects. The game also alters details of gameplay based on what the player views. Throughout his journey, Harry encounters puzzles such as mechanisms, which reward either a key required to progress or a bonus memento. In the Wii version, the Wii Remote is used for puzzle solving and to control the flashlight and cell phone.|$|E
5|$|Jerry {{inherits}} {{some old}} possessions {{of his grandfather}} Irving. Among them is a statue that looks just like one George's family had, until George broke it. Jerry promises that George can have it, but leaves it in his apartment for a few days. Kramer takes a few of Irving's old clothes, including a hat which he believes makes him look like Joe Friday of Dragnet. Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (Michael D. Conway). Jerry is very impressed {{by the quality of}} the cleaning; but when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited, and believes Ray stole it. He calls Kramer <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>his</b> apartment, and when Kramer cannot find the statue there, Jerry’s suspicion is confirmed.|$|E
25|$|Slocum navigated {{without a}} chronometer, instead {{relying on the}} {{traditional}} method of dead reckoning for longitude, which required only a cheap tin clock for approximate time, and noon-sun sights for latitude. On one long passage in the Pacific, Slocum also famously shot a lunar distance observation, decades after these observations had ceased to be commonly employed, which allowed him <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>his</b> longitude independently. However, Slocum's primary method for finding longitude was still dead reckoning; he recorded only one lunar observation during the entire circumnavigation.|$|E

25|$|Williams hit his {{athletic}} peak in 1996, beginning with an American indoor record of 20.40seconds over 200m {{in the early}} stages of the season, which was the third fastest indoor time that year. He finished as runner-up in the event behind Kevin Little at the USA Indoor Track and Field Championships. While competing at the Fresno Relays in California, Williams' 100m race was spoiled when his shoe came off. Keen <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>his</b> competitive level, Williams opted to run an impromptu 200m at the meet instead. He clocked a personal record time of 19.87seconds into a headwind, a time that only Michael Johnson and Frankie Fredericks had beaten since 1992.|$|E
25|$|It was {{collected}} by Newton, a defender moving {{up from a}} deep position, and it quickly put him in excellent attacking position with few opponents <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>his</b> progress. Newton advanced on a short dribble, before producing a low, outstanding diagonal cross that found Mullery who had sprinted into the goalmouth. Mullery finished what he had started, by driving the ball home past the German goalkeeper Sepp Maier. Tactically, this goal combines {{the power of the}} long pass with that of the two-man combination, and indeed, before his pass to Newton, Mullery had exchanged passes with Francis Lee before setting off on his final combination run.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, McCrone visited Yale to take new microsamples {{from the}} map, partly <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>his</b> earlier results, and partly to apply new techniques. Photomicrographs taken at 1 {{micrometer}} intervals through {{the thickness of}} ink samples demonstrated that the manufactured anatase particles were not just sticking to the surface as Cahill's criticisms had implied, and Fourier transform spectroscopy identified the ink's binder as gelatin, probably made from animal skin. In July 2002, using Raman spectroscopy, the presence of significant quantities of anatase in the map ink was confirmed by British researchers Katherine Brown and Robin Clark, and the remaining traces of black pigment in the ink were found to consist essentially of soot-type carbon.|$|E

25|$|The {{first sign}} that Tobin had a {{challenger}} within the Teamsters came in 1947. Dave Beck had risen steadily in the Teamsters hierarchy in the Pacific Northwest, becoming {{president of the}} Western Conference of Teamsters in 1937 and an international vice-president in 1940. As Beck's influence rose, Tobin attempted <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>his</b> growing power but failed. After Beck's election as vice-president, he began to challenge Tobin {{for control of the}} union. In 1947, Beck marshaled his forces and defeated a proposed dues increase to fund new organizing. In 1942, he began a six-year campaign to seize control of the International Teamster newsmagazine. He ousted its editor and won the executive board's approval to install his own man in the job in 1948. In 1946, Beck successfully campaigned to amend the union's constitution to create the post of executive vice-president. He subsequently won the 1947 election to fill the position.|$|E

25|$|The great wave of {{organizing}} which the union engaged {{in during the}} Great Depression and the war significantly boosted {{the political power of}} a number of regional Teamsters leaders, and the leadership of the union engaged in a number of power struggles in the post-war period. By 1949, the union's membership had topped one million. Dave Beck (elected an international vice-president in 1940) was increasingly influential in the international union, and Tobin attempted <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>his</b> growing power but failed. In 1946, Beck successfully overcame Tobin's opposition and won approval of an amendment to the union's constitution creating the post of executive vice-president. Beck then won the 1947 election to fill the position. Beck also successfully opposed in 1947 a Tobin-backed dues increase to fund new organizing. The following year, Beck was able to demand the ouster of the editor of International Teamster magazine and install his own man in the job.|$|E
