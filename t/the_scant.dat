5|$|Karas, however, {{suffered}} the worst criticisms for its story. Many reviewers {{and even the}} voice actors could not follow its dialogue and presentation. Other reviewers felt the abstract presentation forced viewers who wanted to understand the story, to pay extreme attention to <b>the</b> <b>scant</b> details presented in the show. Reelfilm and DVD Verdict were more critical, stating the viewer {{should not have to}} resort to reading summaries on the packaging to make sense of a story populated with incoherent battles and characters hard to tell apart from.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine territories, {{held back}} by their closed economies, {{the lack of any}} {{activity}} closely linked to foreign trade, and <b>the</b> <b>scant</b> amounts of labour and capital they consequently received, fell far behind those of other areas of the colonial world that participated in foreign trade. Only activities associated with a dynamic exporting centre enjoyed some degree of prosperity, as occurred in Tucuman, where cloth was manufactured, and in Córdoba and the Litoral, where livestock was raised to supply the mines of Upper Peru.|$|E

5|$|The castle, {{situated}} on a headland overlooking Loch Ness, {{is one of}} the largest in Scotland in area. It was approached from the west and defended by a ditch and drawbridge. The buildings of the castle were laid out around two main enclosures on the shore. The northern enclosure or Nether Bailey includes most of the more intact structures, including the gatehouse, and the five-story Grant Tower at the north end of the castle. The southern enclosure or Upper Bailey, sited on higher ground, comprises <b>the</b> <b>scant</b> remains of earlier buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} British {{deployment}} into the Adriatic came in May 1808, when the frigate HMS Unite under Captain Patrick Campbell arrived off Venice. During May, Campbell severely disrupted French and Italian shipping off the busiest Adriatic seaport and captured three ships sent against {{him by the}} Italian Navy. The French response to these depredations was to despatch the small frigate Var to Venice, an action which {{had little effect on}} British operations. British activity in the Adriatic was however curtailed during the year by the British war with the Ottoman Empire, which absorbed <b>the</b> <b>scant</b> British naval resources in the Eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} early research of Early Netherlandish art {{occurred in the}} 1920s, in German art historian Max Jakob Friedländer's pioneering Meisterwerke der Niederländischen Malerei des 15. und 16. Jahrhunderts. Friedländer focused on the biographical details of the painters, establishing attribution, and examining their major works. The undertaking proved extremely difficult, given <b>the</b> <b>scant</b> historical record of even the {{most significant}} artists. Fellow-German Erwin Panofsky's analysis in the 1950s and 1960s followed and in many ways challenged Friedländer's work. Writing in the United States, Panofsky made the work of the German art historians accessible to the English-speaking world for the first time. He effectively legitimized Netherlandish art as a field of study, and raised its status to something similar to the early Italian renaissance.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1845, Palmer {{traveled}} to Oregon without his family, as captain of a wagon train of 23 wagons. Stephen Meek served as the train's paid guide. Meek left the group at Fort Hall to lead {{some of the members}} on the Meek Cutoff. The remaining parts of the wagon train {{reached the end of the}} overland Oregon Trail at the Columbia River, and unwilling to wait for transport down the dangerous Cascade Rapids, Palmer's party joined Sam Barlow's party in a quest for passage through the Cascade Range around the south side of Mount Hood. Palmer climbed to the 9,000-foot level of Mount Hood on October 7, 1845—with little food and <b>the</b> <b>scant</b> protection of moccasins—to scout a route off the mountains. This was Mount Hood's first recorded climb; the Palmer Glacier on the mountain is named for him.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears as}} if <b>the</b> <b>scant</b> {{differences}} between southern Canadian and western U.S. populations result from genetic drift, due to the recent reduction in population and range fragmentation. Until the early 20th century, the southern migratory birds occupied a much larger and continuous range. Thus, the subspecies G. c. rowani may well be abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Other reports {{include a}} single tooth found in Moutier, Switzerland. Originally named by Janensch in 1920 as Labrosaurus meriani, the tooth was later {{referred}} Ceratosaurus sp. (of unknown species) by Madsen and Welles. Soto and Perea, in 2008, described teeth from the Tacuarembó Formation in Uruguay that show features diagnostic for Ceratosaurus. These authors, however, stress that {{a referral to}} Ceratosaurus is infeasible due to <b>the</b> <b>scant</b> remains, and note that the referral of the European and African Material to Ceratosaurus has to be viewed with caution.|$|E

He joined Tsar Fedor's choir, the Gosudarevy Pevchie Diaki (Государевы Певчие Дьяки, The Tsar's Singers) {{when he was in his}} twenties; his salary is recorded in 1678. He quickly rose to prominence as both singer and composer. In the 1680s he collaborated with Simeon Polotsky (a famed churchman, man of letters and tutor to the children of Tsar Aleksey Mikhailovich), composing musical settings of Polotsky's psalter and an almanac of sacred poetry. In the 1680s Titov also joined Tsar Ivan's choir.|$|E
25|$|The General Board in 1909 {{reviewed}} <b>the</b> <b>scant</b> progress since 1900 {{and concluded}} that neither the Navy Department nor the Marine Corps had done much to make the advanced base force a reality. Commandant George F. Elliott and his staff were criticized by the Navy officers for not implementing former Commandant Charles Heywood's agreements. Admiral George Dewey expressed disappointment and Navy Commander William F. Fullam even denounced Elliott for failure to use additional Marines for expeditionary duty, which was the only hope for naval reformers in creating the advanced base force.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, an {{effective}} defence of Canada by France requires an extraordinarily large commitment of resources {{in comparison to}} <b>the</b> <b>scant</b> economic value in return, and any resources thus expended, even if allowing victories in the short term, are wasted as they can only serve at best to postpone {{for a few more}} decades the handing over of Canada to Britain, which is inevitable in the long term. Consequently, sound economic policy dictates handing over Canada to Britain as soon as possible and concentrating France's resources in its Caribbean colonies, more valuable economically and more readily defensible.|$|E

25|$|While it {{may have}} come as a {{surprise}} to Rivers, the offer of a Cambridge lectureship had come about as part of a long process of evolution within the University's Natural Science Tripos. Earlier in 1893, Professor McKendrick, of Glasgow, had examined subject and reported unfavourably on <b>the</b> <b>scant</b> knowledge of the special senses displayed by the candidates; it was in reaction to this that Sir Michael Foster, who had seen the potential in this shy, retiring Bart's man, appointed Rivers as a lecturer and he became Fellow Commoner at St John's College forthwith. He was to become a Fellow of the College in 1902.|$|E
25|$|At this time, the socii were roughly {{level with}} the Romans in terms of Italian manpower, and of course their forces were as well-equipped and trained, having fought {{overseas}} alongside the Romans for over a century. Each side initially deployed c. 100,000 troops. But the Romans possessed the enormous advantage of controlling the overseas empire and its huge manpower and economic resources. The Romans thus had exclusive control of allied troops, including Gallic and Spanish heavy cavalry, Numidian light cavalry and other more specialised troops. The socii, on the other hand, were limited by <b>the</b> <b>scant</b> economic resources of the mountainous interior of the Italian peninsula.|$|E
25|$|Other {{races of}} Men are {{mentioned}} in Tolkien's work, though {{they play a}} relatively small part {{in the history of}} Middle-earth. Among these are the Lossoth, a hardy people native to the Ice Bay of Forochel in the far north. A race of wicked Men descended from wild Hill-folk inhabited the realm of Angmar and served its Witch-king until the fall of that kingdom. Tolkien also makes reference to Giants in The Hobbit. These Giants {{may be related to the}} race of Man, though <b>the</b> <b>scant</b> information about them had led to debate over their exact nature and even their existence as an independent race in Tolkien's world.|$|E

On <b>the</b> <b>scantest</b> of data (weather bureaus, out the window, smell in the air and nut gatherers) but prior to satellite, Doppler weather radar, space weather, home weather stations, and little local information - Giese could look globally and give weather forecasts as far out as six weeks or six months. By the mid-1970s, KCRA established news bureaus throughout the state, began producing its own public affairs programming, and initiated a consumer affairs division to answer the needs of concerned consumers.|$|R
25|$|Bothriolepis is a genus placed {{within the}} placoderm order Antiarchi. The {{earliest}} antiarch placoderms {{first appeared in}} the Silurian period of the Paleozoic Era and could be found distributed on every paleocontinent by the Devonian period. The earliest members of Bothriolepis appear by the Middle Devonian. Antiarchs, as well as other placoderms, are morphologically diverse and are characterized by bony plates that cover their head and the anterior part of the trunk. Early ontogenetic stages of placoderms had thinner bony plates within both the head and trunk-shield, which allowed for easy distinction between early placoderm ontogenetic stages within the fossil record and taxa that possessed fully developed bony plates but were small by characterization. Placoderm bony plates were generally made up of three layers, including a compact basal lamellar bony layer, a middle spongy bony layer and a superficial layer; Bothriolepis can be classified as a placoderm since it possesses these layers. Placoderms were extinct {{by the end of the}} Devonian. Placodermi is a paraphyletic group of the clade Gnathostomata, which includes all jawed vertebrates. It is unclear exactly when gnathostomes emerged, but <b>the</b> <b>scant</b> early fossil record indicates that it was sometime in the Early Palaeozoic era. The last species of Bothriolepis died out, together with the rest of Placodermi, at the end of the Devonian period.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} days battle the Persians had either inflicted massive {{casualties}} on Astyages' personal guard that {{was made up of}} cavalry, or the rest of his army that was also cavalry. Nevertheless, the Persians still claimed victory the first day. The second day of the battle Cyrus, assuming the battle had ended, secretly retired south {{with the rest of the}} armed forces, while only Cambyses and a few old men remained in the city. When Cyrus was forced to fight again, Astyages' ingenious move of cavalry occurred, which was aimed at capturing the poorly guarded city. As he was assuming the battle had not ended, he easily captured the city, while only Cambyses is reported to have been wounded and later died. It is debated among today's historians if the second day is to be counted as part of the original battle, or that it should be counted as a separate battle. As the Persians retired south, Astyages readily abandoned the city, which is based partly on <b>the</b> <b>scant</b> sources from Nicolaus, therefore not becoming a complete victory for Astyages, as he is not known to put a garrison there after he and his forces went south after the Persians. It was however a psychological blow to the Medes as they thought the Persians were lucky in the first battle, but again the Persians won, this time tactically. Both armies later went back to their camps and organized their armies while deciding where to meet for the next fight. Then as the year passed, both forces agreed to meet at the Persian capital which Astyages wished to capture.|$|E
