5|$|The modern Saluki has {{retained}} qualities of hunting hounds and may seem reserved <b>to</b> <b>strangers.</b> The often independent and aloof breed {{may be difficult}} to train. Training methods should always be gentle and patient. Salukis may bore easily and are not an ideal breed to leave unattended for long periods. The Saluki does not typically enjoy rough games or activities such as retrieving balls. Early socialization will help prevent timidity and shyness in later life. Given its hunting instincts, the dog is prone to chasing moving objects.|$|E
5|$|The term {{attachment}} {{disorder is}} used to describe emotional and behavioral problems of young children, and also applied to school-age children, teenagers and adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on {{the age of the}} individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may be very different with one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within the relationship and interactions of the two people rather than an aspect of one or the other personality. No list of symptoms can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of age appropriate social behaviors with adults. For example, in a toddler, attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults in a strange environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior might involve excessive friendliness and inappropriate approaches <b>to</b> <b>strangers.</b>|$|E

As a feasibility study, they collected information regarding response rate, and response time. 42% of users responded <b>to</b> questions from <b>strangers,</b> and 44% of the responses arrived within 30 minutes.|$|R

25|$|There is {{evidence}} that Doberman Pinschers in North America have a calmer and more even temperament than their European counterparts because of the breeding strategies employed by American breeders. Because of these differences in breeding strategies, different lines of Doberman Pinschers have developed different traits.

25|$|The {{need for}} secrecy and inconspicuousness deeply colors the traditions and mannerisms of mafiosi. Mafiosi are {{discouraged}} from consuming alcohol or other drugs, as in an inebriated state {{they are more}} likely to blurt out sensitive information. They also frequently adopt self-effacing attitudes <b>to</b> <b>strangers</b> so as to avoid unwanted attention. Most Sicilians tend to be very verbose and expressive, whereas mafiosi tend to be more terse and subdued. Mafiosi are also forbidden from writing down anything about their activities, lest such evidence be discovered by police.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Cornwall {{are involved in}} the manufacture of tin ingots. They mine the ore, smelt it and then work it into pieces the shape of knuckle-bones, after which it is transported to the island of Ictis by wagon, which can be done at low tide. Merchants purchasing it there pack it on horses for 30days to the river Rhône, where it is carried down to the mouth. Diodorus says that the {{inhabitants of}} Cornwall are civilised in manner and especially hospitable <b>to</b> <b>strangers</b> because of their dealings with foreign merchants.|$|E
25|$|Rhodesian ridgebacks are loyal, intelligent, and {{somewhat}} aloof <b>to</b> <b>strangers.</b> This {{is not to}} be confused with aggression; a ridgeback of proper temperament will be more inclined to ignore, rather than challenge, a stranger. This breed requires positive, reward-based training, good socialization and consistency; it is often not the best choice for inexperienced dog owners. Ridgebacks are strong-willed, intelligent, and many seem to have a penchant for mischief, though loving. They are protective of their owners and families. If trained well, they can be excellent guard dogs. Like any dog, they can become aggressive when they are not socialized properly.|$|E

Throughout {{the last decade of the}} century, his fame as an antiquarian slowly rose, as did the public attention paid to his museum – an object of curiosity <b>to</b> <b>strangers</b> visiting the city. As a result of his studies of Roman remains, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1697; some of his communications appear in their transactions. In the same year he was elected an Assistant, or Common-Councilman, in the Corporation of Leeds. He abandoned his connections with the dissenters in 1699.|$|E
25|$|Tuesday 1stMay. Hazy, raw. Yesty {{was very}} {{unfavorable}} {{for the general}} moving of our great city. High rents, incommodious dwellings, & necessity combine to crowd our streets with carts overloaded with furniture & hand barrows with sofas, chairs, sideboards, looking glasses & pictures, so as to render the sidewalks almost impassable. The practice of all moving on one day, & give up & hiring Houses in Feby is of an antient custom & when the city was small & inhabitants few in number, almost every body owned or continued for years tenants in the same houses. Few instances of removals were seen, but now N York is literally in an uproar for several days before & after the 1stofMay. This practice of move all, <b>to</b> <b>strangers</b> appears absurd, but it is attended with the advantage of affording a greater choice of abodes in the Feby quarter.|$|E

They instantly fall in love, unaware of being promised in marriage sixteen years ago. Briar Rose asks Phillip to come to her cottage that evening and meet her family.|$|E
