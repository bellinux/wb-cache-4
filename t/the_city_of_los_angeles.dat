5|$|In a {{case study}} of the Los Angeles Basin, {{simulations}} showed that even when trees are not strategically placed in these urban heat islands, they can still aid in minimization of pollutants and energy reduction. It is estimated that with this wide-scale implementation, <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> can annually save $100M with most of the savings coming from cool roofs, lighter colored pavement, and the planting of trees. With a citywide implementation, added benefits from the lowering smog-level would result in at least one billion dollars of saving per year.|$|E

5|$|US395 {{traverses}} {{the entire}} length of the Owens Valley, entering the valley near the former site of the Owens Lake. The valley, named for one of explorer John C.

5|$|Next, {{two other}} {{national}} flags are hoisted on flagpoles {{one at a}} time while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of Greece to honor the birthplace of the Olympic Games, and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games. In Moscow during the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott, the flag raised to represent the next games host was that of <b>the</b> <b>City</b> <b>of</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> instead of the flag of the boycotting-United States. In Sydney and Athens, two Greek flags were raised because Greece was the next games host (in 2000) and in 2004, because Greece was hosting the games. Then, while the Olympic Hymn is played, the Olympic Flag that was hoisted during the opening ceremonies is lowered from the flagpole and carried from the stadium.|$|E

5|$|The game {{takes place}} in <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> in the year 1947, with players {{assuming}} the role of Los Angeles Police Department officer, and later detective, Cole Phelps. The game starts with Phelps as a uniformed patrolman, and follows his career as he advances through the police department bureaus (desks) of Traffic, Homicide, Vice and Arson. Each desk gives players a new partner who will help Phelps in his investigation {{of a number of}} cases based on a specific type of crime. The game assigns players with cases that they must solve. After each case, players receive a rating of 1–5 stars depending on their performance in both interrogations and searching for clues. In some cases, when searching an area for clues to the crime, players can also find newspapers. Besides reading the story, the newspapers give access to a short cinematic that either covers a part of the game's overarching plot or a flashback to Phelps' war memories. Near the end of the final desk, players assume control of private investigator Jack Kelso, who becomes the player character for {{most of the rest of}} the game; although different in appearance and personality, he controls identically to Phelps.|$|E
