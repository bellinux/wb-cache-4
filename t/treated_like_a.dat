5|$|Initially Nxumalo stays {{away from}} {{political}} articles, but eventually writes {{about more than}} entertainment after his wife and Mandela encourage him. When a young man goes missing at a Boer farm and is feared enslaved, Nxumalo decides to investigate undercover. He gets employment as a labourer at the farm, where he is <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> slave and nearly killed. He becomes a celebrity when his story is published, further reinforced by getting himself in prison and reporting about its conditions. Nxumalo decides that his destiny {{is to be a}} muckracker and, {{with the help of the}} German photographer Jürgen Schadeberg (Gabriel Mann), ventures on more risky investigations.|$|E
5|$|Portland had {{strongly}} desired Washington, {{and their}} general manager Stu Inman, {{was a close}} friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to be the last time he was traded. This was important as the media coverage and re-locations had been hard on Pat and the children. To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went he was <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> beloved celebrity.|$|E
5|$|Cristina Kirchner is {{considered}} to be a populist leader and, like other contemporary populists in Latin America, built a system of propaganda to legitimize her actions: the Relato K. This propaganda works around a number of usual themes: the glorification of the state to the detriment of the individual rights; use of conspiracy theories to explain mistakes as attacks from others; blaming neoliberalism for the poverty; and glorifying democracy in speeches while maintaining only the appearance of it (procedural democracy). The political world is divided in two halves, the people and those against the people, with the Kirchners described as the saviors of the people. Under this vision, the people are <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> homogeneous group, with a unified collective will, that the leader interprets beyond the boundaries of parliaments and parties. Kirchnerite writer Ernesto Laclau considers this the perfect form of democracy. This division is used to justify the rejection of those described as being against the people, and to polarize the population. The problems caused by her policies, such as inflation, are always explained as the result of class conflict and imperialism. Economic activity is described as a zero-sum game, where any wealth is the result of the exploitation of someone else, which justifies economic interventionism. Kirchner's victory in the 2011 election was used to justify authoritarian policies, as those policies would be the general will; opposition and criticism was often described as antidemocratic or even as the plotting of a coup d'état. Laclau's vision of the people has been criticized by other writers because it left little room for opposition or criticism, and because the citizen is actually reduced to a mere spectator unable to contest government policies.|$|E

25|$|Yu Jin {{remained}} as a prisoner-of-war in Guan Yu's base in Jing Province until late 219, when Liu Bei's territories {{in the province}} were captured by Sun Quan's general Lü Meng in a stealth invasion. Guan Yu was captured and executed by Sun Quan's forces. Yu Jin was released and brought to Wu (Sun Quan's domain), where he was <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> guest. However, he was also ridiculed and humiliated by Yu Fan, an official serving under Sun Quan.|$|E
25|$|Historians have {{emphasized}} that the sense of honor was a central concern of upper-class white Southerners. The idea of being <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> second-class citizen was anathema {{and could not be}} tolerated by an honorable southerner. The abolitionist position held that slavery was a negative or evil phenomenon that damaged the rights of white men and the prospects of republicanism. To the white South this rhetoric made Southerners second-class citizens because it trampled what they believed was their Constitutional right to take their chattel property anywhere.|$|E

She was tasked with maintaining the barrier surrounding the King's castle, though she eventually leaves her position under a neutrality agreement which prohibits her from interfering with the King's army as long as non-combatants are not targeted by his forces. She is a timid and kind woman who uses her powers to assist civilians and lead lost spirits to the afterlife. She runs an unsuccessful magic shop in Axel which is later managed by Vanir, in which she is <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> slave worker.|$|E
25|$|Kees {{was born}} in Beatrice, Nebraska, to John Kees, a {{hardware}} manufacturer, and Sarah Green Kees, a schoolteacher. The Kees family was well-to-do, John Kees being part owner of F.D. Kees Manufacturing Co., which patented and produced corn-husking hooks as well as innovative products such as a window defroster for automobiles and a moving lawn sprinkler that resembled a farm tractor. Weldon Kees was a precocious child whose playmates included Robert Taylor and whose pastimes included producing his own magazines, giving puppet shows and even acting. He was <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> small adult by his parents, whom he addressed by their first names.|$|E

25|$|Abdullah Al-Kidd {{was held}} in a maximum {{security}} prison for 16 days, and in supervised release for 13 months. Al-Kidd was born Lavoni T. Kidd in 1973 in Wichita, Kansas. When he converted to Islam {{as a student at}} the University of Idaho, where he was a prominent football player, he changed his name. He asserts that Ashcroft violated his civil liberties as an American citizen, as he was <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> terrorist and not allowed to consult an attorney. Al-Kidd's lawyers say Ashcroft, as US Attorney General, encouraged authorities after 9/11 to arrest potential suspects as material witnesses when they lacked probable cause to believe the suspects had committed a crime.|$|E
25|$|Kathakali has {{traditionally}} been an art that has continued {{from one generation to}} the next through a guru-disciples (gurukkula) based training system. Artist families tended to pick promising talent from within their own extended families, sometimes from outside the family, and the new budding artist typically stayed with his guru as a student and <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> member of the family. The guru provided both the theoretical and practical training to the student, and the disciple would accompany the guru to formal performances. In modern times, professional schools train students of Kathakali, with some such as those in Trivandrum Margi school emphasizing a single teacher for various courses, while others such as the Kerala Kalamandalam school wherein students learn subjects from different teachers. Kathakali schools are now found all over India, as well as in parts of the Western Europe and the United States.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of being}} <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> queen, Caroline found that her estranged husband's {{accession}} paradoxically made her position worse. On visiting Rome, the pope refused her an audience, and the pope's minister Cardinal Consalvi {{insisted that she}} be greeted only as a duchess of Brunswick, {{and not as a}} queen. In an attempt to assert her rights, she made plans to return to Britain. The King demanded that his ministers get rid of her. He successfully persuaded them to remove her name from the liturgy of the Church of England, but they would not agree to a divorce because they feared the effect of a public trial. The government was weak and unpopular, and a trial detailing salacious details of both Caroline's and George's separate love lives was certain to destabilise it further. Rather than run the risk, the government entered into negotiations with Caroline, and offered her an increased annuity of £50,000 if she stayed abroad.|$|E

25|$|On the 14 and 16 July the Soviet Fleets landed more {{forces behind}} Dietl. LG 1's Ju 87s were shifted back {{to support the}} Mountain Corps. On 20 July the Soviet {{destroyer}} Stremitelnyy was sunk along with the patrol ship SKR-20/Shtil in the Kola Bay by LG 1. Just days later it was moved back to support the offensive at Salla. The unit was <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fire-brigade, rushing from one hot spot to another. IV(St)./LG 1's Ju 87s suffered {{more than any other}} Stuka unit in 1941, lsoing 25 of its 36 aircraft. Badly depleted, it could not support a breakthrough to isolate the Kola Peninsula, nor could it support the capture of Murmansk by Dietl. The advance halted 64 kilometres short of the Kirov railway, and three years of positional warfare set in. It did succeed in relieving pressure on the Mountain troops in the far north, when it was able to appear in strength. The greatest success of the Axis in the north came not against the Soviets, but the British Royal Air Force (RAF).|$|E
25|$|While Duke University’s {{reputation}} grew as {{a national}} educational institution, its attitudes towards black workers remained unchanged. The same year the Duke Employees Benevolent Society was established in 1965, Duke revealed a new $200 million plan to promote Duke’s status as a top national university. The funds were used to advance the renovation of new libraries, science research labs, and more modern facilities. Despite Duke University’s reputation as an institution for higher education and its growing expertise in preparing its students for the professional society, the working environments and attitudes towards black, blue-collar workers had not changed. Workers were not given health insurance, received little pay, had inconsistent and demanding schedules, often working ten to twelve days without a day off, and were treated unprofessionally. One nurse’s maid, Helen Johnstone, recalled being <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> servant: “When I was a nurse’s maid, our second head nurse, Joan Ashley, she used to run me everywhere—uptown to get the immunizations and {{to put them in}} my refrigerator. She had me run to the library to return her books for her on time.” It was not unusual for black workers to be treated this way, especially as a result of unclear job descriptions that gave those with higher power control over the tasks assigned to black workers.|$|E

500|$|In a June 2015 column {{written for}} the French sports {{newspaper}} L'Équipe Murray criticised {{what he described as}} a double standard applied by many in their attitudes towards Amélie Mauresmo in her role as Murray's coach, highlighting how many observers attributed his poor performances during the early part of her tenure to her appointment, which Murray denied, before pointing out that his previous coaches had not been blamed by the media for other spells of poor form. He also lamented the lack of female coaches working in elite tennis, and concluded: [...] "Have I become a feminist?
