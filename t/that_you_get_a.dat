500|$|In {{addition}} to Bale breaking {{his hand and}} Worthington hurting his back, special effects technician Mike Menardis almost lost his leg filming an explosion. The sequence required a manhole cover being blown into the air, which hit Menardis and partially severed his leg. McG noted it was {{a testament to the}} gritty style of the film. [...] "I say with respect, I didn't want that Star Wars experience of everything's a blue screen, tennis balls, and go for it. I had Stan Winston build all the machines. We built all the sets, the explosive power, the explosive power so you feel that wind and that percussion and that heat blowing your eyebrows off. And with <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> couple bumps and bruises on the way, but you get it in an integrity and a realism that hopefully echoes Apocalypse Now. You couldn't say, 'Let's just shoot Apocalypse Now in Burbank, I think it's going to feel just as good.|$|E
500|$|Greg Beeman, who {{directed}} the episode, spoke about Remi Aubuchon's hiring. He said that Remi had [...] "a lot of {{ideas about how to}} keep the good stuff we’d established in Season 1", and [...] "diminish the things that weren’t as strong". Steven Spielberg's original conception of Falling Skies was that the characters in the series would be nomadic. The idea for the second season was to [...] "create a mobile refugee camp made up of vehicles and rag-tag tents." [...] Chris Faloona, who was the Director of Photography in the first season, was unable to return due to commitments on another series, and Nate Goodman was hired. Aubuchon and Beeman discussed what was a head for the characters this season, and soon after, Beeman called Connor Jessup, who plays Ben Mason, and said [...] "I’ve just heard what the plans are for you for this season. [...] And my strong advice is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> trainer and start eating your Wheaties! [...] You are in a HUGE storyline is going to revolve around you… [...] You’re a warrior, you’re a skitter killer and you’re a badass!" [...] Jessup hired a trainer that very day.|$|E

2500|$|Tape {{effects were}} limited to slapback echo and reverb. Archivist Mark Linett notes: [...] "to my ears, it sounds more like the plate [...] rather than chambers. It should be {{mentioned}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> significantly different sound from a chamber when you record it 'live' as opposed to doing it off tape, and one reason these records sound {{the way they do}} is that the reverb was being printed as part of the recording – unlike today where we'll record 'dry' and add the effects later." [...] Although Spector's trademark sound was aurally complex, many of the best-known Wall of Sound recordings were recorded on Ampex three-track recorders. Spector's backing tracks were recorded live, and usually in a single take. These backing tracks were mixed live, in mono, and taped directly onto one track of the three-track recorder. The lead vocal was then taped, usually (though not always) as an uninterrupted live performance, recorded direct to the second track of the recorder. The master was completed with the addition of backing vocals on the third track before the three tracks were mixed down to create the mono master tape. By comparison, Brian produced tracks that were of greater technical complexity by using state-of-the-art four-track and eight-track recorders. Most backing tracks were recorded onto a Scully four-track 288 tape recorder before being later dubbed down (in mono) onto one track of an eight-track machine. Wilson typically divided instruments by three tracks: drums–percussion–keyboard, horns, and bass–additional percussion–guitar. The fourth track usually contained a rough reference mix used during playback at the session, later to be erased for overdubs such as a string section.|$|E
