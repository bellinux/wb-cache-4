5|$|The {{bidding process}} pitted Taiwan High Speed Rail Consortium (THSRC) against the Chunghwa High Speed Rail Consortium (CHSRC). THSRC's bid {{was based on}} the {{high-speed}} <b>technology</b> <b>platform</b> of Eurotrain, a joint venture between GEC-Alsthom, the main maker of the French TGV, and Siemens, the main maker of the German ICE, while CHSRC's bid was based on Japanese Shinkansen technology supplied by Taiwan Shinkansen Consortium (TSC), a joint venture of Japanese companies. THSRC, which submitted the lower bid and promised to build the line with zero net cost from the government, was chosen as preferred bidder in September 1997. The group was renamed and formally established as the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation (THSRC) in May 1998. THSRC and the government signed the BOT agreement on 23 July 1998.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>technology</b> <b>platforms</b> in diversified companies as networks of unique technologies in diverse applications is increasing. The {{reason is that}} <b>technology</b> <b>platforms</b> support diversified companies to handle the conflicting priorities of fulfilling the customer demand for individualized innovations, while generating company-wide technological synergies. Thus, the success of diversified companies can be decisively determined by the implementation of <b>technology</b> <b>platforms.</b> A significant prerequisite for this matter, among others, is a coherent concept for the systematization of the requirements of <b>technology</b> <b>platforms.</b> In practice however, systematizing the requirements of <b>technology</b> <b>platforms</b> is a huge challenge {{for most of the}} diversified companies interested in apply ing the concept of <b>technology</b> <b>platforms.</b> The reason {{is that there is no}} established opinion in theory how the requirements of <b>technology</b> <b>platforms</b> should be systematically described and how they should be systematically structured. Therefore, the objective of this paper is the development of a model realizing a systematical description and structuring of the requirements of <b>technology</b> <b>platforms</b> in diversified companies...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the <b>technology</b> <b>platforms</b> that bring {{together}} different types of actors in the same sector by supporting the Operational Programme Enterprise and Innovation. The aim was to use three case studies to assess the functioning of <b>technology</b> <b>platforms</b> and their benefits to its members. The thesis is mainly qualitative in nature. Research questions focus on the membership structure and activities of <b>technology</b> <b>platforms,</b> the importance of various types of proximity in cooperation with its members and the impact on their competitiveness. Thanks to the paper I found out the benefits of <b>technology</b> <b>platforms</b> to deepen relationships and mutual trust, which proved important for the mutual cooperation. Social and cognitive proximity {{are the two most}} important types of proximity in cooperation with actors. The thesis also revealed deficiencies in meeting the objectives of <b>technology</b> <b>platforms</b> consisting in the definition and implementation of the vision of the field. Negative finding is the absence of government among members of the <b>technology</b> <b>platforms.</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>platforms</b> are with their activities shaping the emergence and spread of knowledge and innovation for mutual cooperation among actors from different backgrounds.
