She immediately took on troops and supplies and again steamed for the Western Pacific, operating out of Japanese, Okinawan, and Korean ports. Private Joe P. Martinez made three additional cruises to the Western Pacific, departing Korean waters for the last time on 5 January 1951. She was laid up 1 September 1952 at Olympia. She was transferred from the Navy to the Maritime Administration on 30 September 1952 and struck from the Navy List on 6 November. Into 1970 she was laid up at Olympia in the National Defense Reserve Fleet; her ultimate fate is unknown. USS Private Joe P. Martinez received four battle stars for Korean service.|$|R

40|$|Input {{congestion}} {{very likely}} existed in rail transport. However, early works measuring the rail transport efficiencies rarely took the input congestion into account; hence, the proposed strategies for enhancing efficiencies can be misleading. This study revisited the rail transport efficiencies with consideration of input congestion. We employed {{data envelopment analysis}} extension method to investigate the input congestion for some selected 24 European Union (EU) railways in 2006. The results indicated {{that there is no}} strong congestion in these 24 railways. However, 12 railways have been diagnosed with weak congestion in the available capacity of freight transport as well as the number of locomotives, 7 railways in the available capacity of passenger transport, and 4 railways in the number of employees. Based on our findings, the managerial implication is to contract the available capacity of freight <b>transport</b> (<b>tonnages)</b> as the most critical strategy, rather than laying-off the excess number of employees suggested by most previous studies, which did not consider the input congestion effects while measuring the rail transport efficiencies...|$|R

Passenger services through both settlements were provided by mixed trains; they ceased to operate from 14 October 1946.

40|$|Exploitation and {{technical}} parameters {{of a ship}} are very important qualitative characteristics which determine {{the efficiency of the}} use of any kind of transportation vessels both for pushboats and for pushed convoys as a whole. Some of the most important exploitation {{and technical}} parameters are: parameter of <b>transport</b> efficiency, <b>tonnage</b> quality parameter, and thrust output of propeller. The complexity of these parameters {{can be seen from the}} fact that they present the values of achieved payload-distance during transportation of cargo in the unit of time per unit of installed (or effective) power of propelling engines of ships. The most reliable means for determining the transport efficiency is the method of testing in actual navigating conditions, which is conducted in order to determine exact technical characteristics of propelling engines of pushboats, and to determine drawbacks in their work and to increase their thrust and speed characteristics. This paper will present the process of choosing the size, shape, and number of barges in the convoy based on experiments conducted on a pushboat whose propelling engines have installed power 3 × 809. 6 kW (3 × 1, 100 HP). Obtained results are based on presumption that the total resistance of a pushed convoy is equal to the total thrust achieved by the ship’s propelling complex. ...|$|R

These filters are: accessibility to a transshipment terminal, transport-mode dependent break-even distances, product type characteristics, shipment size and transport speed requirements. They estimated the potential of rail-, barge- and short sea transport to be 33.5  % of the total <b>tonnage</b> <b>transported.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Until the {{war with}} the Soviet Union was finished, Hitler was {{reluctant}} to have a war with the United States, and insisted upon avoiding [...] "incidents" [...] with the U.S. Navy as much as possible, whereas Raeder was all for a war with the United States. Hitler had cancelled the Z Plan again in late 1940, only to order it restarted {{in the middle of}} 1941 when it seemed that the war against the Soviet Union would soon be over and again cancelled the Z Plan in late 1941. When Hitler cancelled the Z Plan for the final time, Raeder forgot to cancel a contact he had placed with engineering firms for the engines of the first four of the planned H-class super battleships. As a result of that oversight, in June 1944 the Kriegsmarine had to accept and pay for four gigantic engines that were meant to power battleships that did not exist. From Hitler's viewpoint, it was better to wait until the Z Plan was complete before going to war with the United States. Raeder by contrast thought only of the [...] "immediate operational advantages" [...] that would accrue to Germany if the Reich went to war with the United States. On 11 December 1941, Germany declared war on the United States, which was at least in part due to the pressure of Raeder, who was very pleased with going to war with America. Even before the declaration of war on 11 December, Hitler had given orders to Raeder on 8 December 1941 that the Kriegsmarine could now sink on sight American warships and warships of all the Latin American republics except Argentina as well. Raeder gave orders that Kriegsmarine was now to begin Operation Drumbeat, the plan to defeat the United States by sending [...] "wolf-packs" [...] of submarines off the Atlantic coast of the United States to destroy all American shipping. On 12 December 1941, Raeder told Hitler that prospects for victory over the United States were good and that [...] "The situation in the Atlantic will be eased by Japan's successful intervention". Continuing his analysis of the naval situation, Raeder told Hitler: [...] "Reports have already been received of the transfer of some American battleships from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It is certain that light forces, especially destroyers will be required in increased numbers in the Pacific. The need for transport ships will be very great, so that a withdrawal of American merchant ships from the Atlantic can be expected. The strain on British merchant shipping will increase ... The U.S will have to concentrate all her strength in the Pacific during the next few months. Britain will not to run any risks after her severe losses of big ships is referring to sinkings of the [...] It is hardly likely that <b>transport</b> <b>tonnage</b> is available for such occupation tasks or bringing up supplies ... It is improbable that the enemy will give up East Asia even temporarily; by so doing Britain will endanger India very seriously, and the U.S. cannot withdraw her fleet from the Pacific as long as the Japanese fleet has the upper hand". [...] Much to Raeder's annoyance, Hitler followed up declaring war on the U.S. by sending 23 U-boats to the Mediterranean to attack British shipping and another 16 to Norway to guard against a phantom British invasion instead of focusing the U-boat fleet off the eastern United States. Because the United States Navy under the leadership of Admiral Ernest King was not ready for anti-submarine warfare, U-boat operations off the east coast of America {{in the first half of}} 1942 were very successful, and only the diversion of the U-boat fleet to the Mediterranean and Norway kept them from being more successful. The entry of the United States into the war meant the ultimate defeat of the Kriegsmarine as the tremendous productive capacity of American industry meant that the Allies could replace every ship sunk by the U-boats, and then build some more. In 1943, American shipyards turned out enough ships to almost equal the number of all the ships sunk by U-boats between 1939 and 1942. Murray and Millet accused Raeder and the rest of the Seekriegsleitung of wanting war with America because the United States was an [...] "easy target" [...] and of [...] "taking the easiest tactical and operational path without the slightest thought to the strategic or long-range consequences".|$|R
40|$|Air {{transport}} {{provides a}} suitable way of transport for special types of freight such as emergency freight (spare parts, documents), high-value freight (gold, currency, and artwork) and perishables (pharmaceuticals, fresh food, cut flowers) as these products have very short shelf life {{and benefit from}} fast transit times. Air transport is also {{responsible for most of}} the value added. As stated by Boeing, even though air freight accounts for fewer than 2 per cent of total <b>tonnage</b> <b>transported,</b> it represents almost 40 per cent of aggregate value of total world trade, proving that it is a link of paramount importance for the global supply chains. Descriptive models can aid decision makers in their understanding of the response of global air freight flows to external factors such as the global economy and technological innovation and provide a quantitative underpinning of forecasts and of business cases for investment. Although in the air freight transport business, use is often made of long term forecasts, there is little shared knowledge about which methods should be preferred, and hardly any literature at the scientific level. Transport models were originally developed for passengers and ensuingly applied in freight. Although it is accepted that the four-step transport modelling methodology is a fitting framework for freight, many fundamental differences exist between them such as diversity in decision makers, commodities transported, mode properties, the networks etc. In the particular case of air freight transport, these elementary dissimilarities call for an adaptation of the existing methods, towards a modelling framework better suited for the airborne movement of goods. There lacks a strategic model for air freight flows at the global scale that overcomes the insufficiencies of passenger oriented models. This research contributes to the literature by formulating a model for global air freight demand and network flows. The results of the model are presented in the form of international air freight flows, followed by results on a regional level, sensitivity analysis and validation. The model is found to produce realistic results within the rational range set by observed air freight volumes.

40|$|The Swedish railway {{authorities}} {{have a long}} tradition of using performance indicators to follow up their performance. Already in 1915 when they decided to electrify the iron ore line between Kiruna and Riksgränsen, they introduced some indicators to measure and follow up expected benefits of upgrading the transportation system, e. g. total amount and costs per <b>transported</b> iron ore <b>tonnage,</b> employee safety training, and accidents or near-accidents related to the new power source of electricity. Today, one of the requirements on the infrastructure management is to achieve cost-effective maintenance activities and a punctual and cost-effective railroad transportation system. For this, cost-effective maintenance processes are necessary to achieve budget targets, while punctual railroad system is required by different stakeholders. One key issue for Banverket is to verify that undertaken maintenance activities have given expected results, measured in terms of technical, economically, and organizational indicators. The purpose of this thesis is to identify and develop a set of performance indicators that supports the maintenance decision-making process in proportion to punctuality, safety, environmental impact and profitability; i. e. establishing a link and effect model. The main aim is to clarify how different maintenance performance indicators {{can be used to make}} optimal decisions in the maintenance process; show and illustrate present status of the infrastructure as well as predict the future condition based upon today's maintenance decisions. The analysis of existing and potential maintenance performance indicators resulted in a useful set of indicators applicable for railway infrastructure assets management, classified into different classes and subgroups appropriate to match a modified link and effect model originally developed for the offshore industry. A link and effect model adjusted to management of railway infrastructure assets is also presented. In order to successfully implement performance indicators it is important to start with the definition of the business goals and overall objectives that later on must be broken down to maintenance objectives. With clear objectives regarding punctuality, safety, environmental impact, and profitability, is it possible to develop and implement indicators, especially performance driver indicators, for a maintenance department or maintenance contract.
