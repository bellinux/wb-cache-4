5|$|Shoe polish may be {{purchased}} pre-soaked into a hard sponge, {{which can be}} used <b>to</b> <b>buff</b> leather without needing to apply any additional polish to either the leather or the sponge. This is usually known as an applicator. A number of companies that manufacture shoe care products also sell a liquid shoe polish in a squeezable plastic bottle, with a small sponge applicator at the end. To decrease its viscosity, bottled polish usually has a very low wax content.|$|E
5|$|Species of Oryzomys are {{medium-sized}} rats with long, coarse fur. The upperparts are gray to reddish and the underparts white <b>to</b> <b>buff.</b> The {{animals have}} broad feet with reduced or absent ungual tufts of hair around the claws and, {{in at least}} some species, with webbing between the toes. The rostrum (front part of the skull) is broad and the braincase is high. Both the marsh rice rat and O.couesi have 56chromosomes, lack a gall bladder, and have a complex penis (as is characteristic of the Sigmodontinae) with some traits that are rare among oryzomyines; these characteristics are unknown in the other species of this genus.|$|E
5|$|The {{juvenile}} pied butcherbird has {{dark brown}} instead of black plumage, lacks the pale collar {{and has a}} cream <b>to</b> <b>buff</b> lores, chin, and upper throat, becoming more brown on the lower throat and breast. Its underparts are off-white to cream. The bill is dark brown. In its first year, it moults into its first immature plumage, which resembles that of the juvenile, but has a more extensive dark brown throat. Its bill is blue-grey with a dark brown or blackish tip.|$|E

5|$|Oryzomys {{contains}} medium-sized, semiaquatically specialized oryzomyine rodents. They have long, coarse fur that is grayish to reddish on the upperparts {{and white}} <b>to</b> <b>buff</b> on the underparts. The marsh rice rat superficially resembles the introduced species black rat and brown rat, but has larger differences in color between the upper- and underparts. The vibrissae (whiskers) are short and the ears {{are small and}} well-haired. The tail is usually as long as or longer than the head and body and is sparsely haired, but the hairs on the lower side are longer than those above. Females have eight mammae, as in most oryzomyines. The hindfeet are broad and have the first and fifth digits notably shorter than the middle three. The upper surface is hairy, but the underside is naked and covered with small irregularities (squamae). The pads are generally poorly developed, as are the ungual tufts. Interdigital webbing may be present, but its development is variable within the genus.|$|E
5|$|The date of {{egg-laying}} varies {{according to}} locality, but is generally from February to March in the Northern Hemisphere, and from July to August in the Southern Hemisphere, although the Australian subspecies macropus may breed as late as November, and equatorial populations may nest anytime between June and December. If the eggs are lost early in the nesting season, the female usually lays another clutch, although this is extremely rare in the Arctic due to the short summer season. Generally three to four eggs, but sometimes as few as one or as many as five, are laid in the scrape. The eggs are white <b>to</b> <b>buff</b> with red or brown markings. They are incubated for 29 to 33 days, mainly by the female, with the male also helping with the incubation of the eggs during the day, but only the female incubating them at night. The average number of young found in nests is 2.5, and the average number that fledge is about 1.5, due to the occasional production of infertile eggs and various natural losses of nestlings.|$|E
25|$|The Stock Island tree snail {{has a large}} {{conical shell}} (45 - 55 mm in length) with {{variable}} thickness, generally lighter and more translucent than other species of Orthalicus. It is colored white <b>to</b> <b>buff,</b> with weakly developed spiral bands and several flame-like, purple-brown axial stripes. The subspecies O. reses reses and O. reses nosodryas can be distinguished from one another based on the different color patterns of the apical whorl, columella, and parietal callus.|$|E

25|$|The {{conglomerate}} {{is typically}} a medium to fine grained brown <b>to</b> <b>buff</b> sandstone consisting of angular to sub angular grains with scattered flakes of mica; {{it makes a}} good building stone. Conglomerates occur in the basal part of the sequence and shale bands that are micaceous occur in the highest beds. Viewed regionally, the conglomerates appear to be impersistent. Near {{the southern end of}} the district where the ground is not covered by drift three conglomerates can be mapped. The bottom and most important is mostly pebbles - quartz and quartzites with occasional grits and rarely some igneous. These are set in a medium to coarse grained sand matrix. the pebbles can be up to 100mm long.|$|E
25|$|The male will {{courtship}} {{feed the}} female to reinforce their pair-bond or {{to secure a}} mating opportunity. The nest is a well concealed cup of dry grass that is positioned in a deep scrape {{at the base of}} a grass tuft or against a shrub. A flimsy or substantial grass dome (typical of Mirafra and related genera) covers the nest while leaving a front entrance. The cup is lined with finer plant material, and 2 to 3 (rarely 4) eggs are laid. The eggs are white, cream or pink in colour, and speckled brown and grey, especially near the blunter end. The chicks have bright yellow gapes, three black tongue spots, and a spot near the tip of the lower mandible. They are covered in pale grey <b>to</b> <b>buff</b> down, and are brooded by the female only. The incubation period is about 14 to 15 days, and singing by the male decreases as incubation commences. The young are fed by both parents, though mainly by the female. Surviving chicks leave the nest after about 12 days, before they are able to fly. Post-breeding moult has been recorded in mid December in Botswana and from July to August in Kenya.|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} laid singly {{on a wide}} range of food plants {{including}} hedge mustard (Sisybrium officinale), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), cuckooflower (Cardamine pratense), water-cress (Rorippa nastutium-aquaticum), charlock (Sinapis arvensis), large bitter-cress (Cardamine amara), wild cabbage (Brassica oleracea), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum), and so it is rarely a pest in gardens or field crops. The caterpillar is green and well camouflaged. When full grown it is green above with black warts, from which arise whitish and blackish hairs. There is a darker line along the back and a yellow line low down on the sides. Underneath the colour is whitish-grey. The spiracular line is dusky but not conspicuous, and the spiracles are blackish surrounded with yellow. There is extensive overlap with other leaf-feeding larvae of large and small whites in some wild populations (e.g. in Morocco). It is often found feeding on the same plant as the orange tip but rarely competes for food because it usually feeds on the leaves whereas the orange tip caterpillar feeds on the flowers and developing seed pods. Like other Pieris species it overwinters as a pupa. This is green in colour, and the raised parts are yellowish and brown. This is the most frequent form, but it varies through yellowish <b>to</b> <b>buff</b> or greyish, and is sometimes without markings.|$|E

500|$|The {{shape of}} the A.australis cap is {{initially}} convex, later flattening out or even developing a central depression, and reaching diameters of [...] wide. The cap margin sometimes splits and rolls back to give a ragged appearance. The centre of the cap is dark buff, honey or isabelline, becoming paler <b>to</b> <b>buff</b> at the margin. The surface is sticky when young or wet, but dries out with age. The remnants of the volva form conical to pyramidal warts that are most densely aggregated in the center, but become sparse and low towards the margin. They are initially white then greyish-sepia or isabelline with white <b>to</b> <b>buff</b> tips.|$|E
500|$|The fruit {{bodies are}} colored yellow overall. The fresh cap, ranging in color from dull creamy yellow to golden yellow <b>to</b> <b>buff,</b> is sticky when moist. White warts adorn the cap surface, {{but they are}} usually flimsy and easily washed away by rain. They are placed randomly, but {{tend to be more}} {{concentrated}} in the center. The cap is typically [...] in diameter, and initially convex before flattening out in maturity. The flesh is white, and shows no change when sliced.|$|E
500|$|Fully grown, the cap {{can range}} from [...] in diameter, whitish to dull-yellow, and is funnel-shaped with a central depression. The gills are narrow and thin, decurrent in attachment, nearly white when young but {{becoming}} pale yellow <b>to</b> <b>buff</b> with age, and sometimes forked near the stipe. The stipe is 3–8cm long and 2.5–4cm thick. It is initially white but develops yellowish-brownish discolorations with age. The mushroom sometimes develops a pale green band {{at the top of}} the stipe. The spore print is white to light cream.|$|E

500|$|Oryzomys couesi is a {{medium-sized}} to large rat with coarse fur that is buff to reddish above, becoming paler towards {{the sides and}} cheeks and darker on the rump and face. The underparts are white <b>to</b> <b>buff.</b> The fur is shorter, brighter, and more intense in color than in the marsh rice rat. The snout ends bluntly and the moderately large eyes show reddish eyeshine. The small ears are black {{on the outside and}} the inside is covered with short, gray <b>to</b> <b>buff</b> or red hairs. The long tail is dark brown above and white to light brown below. The feet are long and stout. On the forefeet, the ungual tufts (tufts of hair on the digits) are present. Many of the pads on the hindfeet are reduced, as are the ungual tufts, and small interdigital webs may be present in at least some specimens. Some of these traits are common adaptations to life in the water in oryzomyines. As in most other oryzomyines, females have eight mammae. Head and body length is , tail length is , hindfoot length is , ear length is , and body mass is [...] Studies in Texas and El Salvador found that males are slightly larger than females.|$|E

As a bluing species in the genus Psilocybe, P.allenii contains the psychoactive compounds psilocin and psilocybin, and it is consumed recreationally for its hallucinogenic properties. It {{is closely related to}} Psilocybe cyanescens, from which it differs macroscopically by the lack of a wavy cap margin.|$|E
500|$|The {{yellowish}} <b>to</b> <b>buff</b> cap {{surface is}} fibrous and roughened, and reaches up to [...] in diameter. The thick stem, {{roughly the same}} color as the cap or lighter, is hollowed out into chambers. All parts of the mushroom turn an intense blue color within a few moments of bruising or cutting. The mushroom is edible, despite its hard stem. A less common variety occurs where the color change is to deep violet rather than blue. The bluing reaction results from the oxidation of a chemical called gyrocyanin.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 17 mm. The forewings are black dorsally with yellowish <b>buff</b> <b>to</b> pale whitish <b>buff</b> lines and bands while the hindwings are bright orange. Adults have been recorded on wing from mid to late July.|$|R
50|$|On May 2, 1921, Buff {{defended his}} American Flyweight Championship against Eddie O'Dowd at Madison Square Garden in a twelve-round {{unanimous}} decision.

The Pocono Formation formed more than 340million years ago, when the land {{was part of the}} coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a build-up of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found at the lake and in the drainage basin for Kitchen Creek: sandstone, shale, siltstone, and conglomerates. In 1894 R. Bruce Ricketts planned to mine yellow ocher near the lake.|$|E
