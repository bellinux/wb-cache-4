40|$|SummaryNeurexin and neuroligin, which undergo heterophilic {{interactions}} {{with each other}} at the synapse, are mutated in some patients with autism spectrum disorder, a set of disorders characterized by deficits in social and emotional learning. We have explored the role of neurexin and neuroligin at sensory-to-motor neuron synapses of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia, which undergoes sensitization, a simple form of learned fear. We find that depleting neurexin in the presynaptic sensory neuron or neuroligin in the postsynaptic motor neuron abolishes both long-term facilitation and the associated presynaptic growth induced by repeated pulses of serotonin. Moreover, introduction into the motor neuron of the R 451 C mutation of neuroligin- 3 linked to autism spectrum disorder blocks both intermediate-term and long-term facilitation. Our results suggest that activity-dependent regulation of the neurexin-neuroligin interaction may govern transsynaptic signaling required for the storage of long-term memory, including emotional memory <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>impaired</b> in autism spectrum disorder...|$|E

Although early-outgrowth endothelial progenitor-like cells promote angiogenesis {{in the setting of}} nor-mal renal function, cells from uremic patients are dysfunctional. When compared with conventional hemo-dialysis, it was hypothesized that nocturnal hemodialysis would improve the in vivo angiogenic activity of these cells in a well described model of ischemic vascular disease. Design, setting, participants, and measurements Early-outgrowth endothelial progenitor-like cells were cul-tured from healthy controls (n 5) and age- and gender-matched conventional hemodialysis (12 h/wk, n 10) and nocturnal hemodialysis (30 to 50 h/wk, n 9) patients. Cells (5 105) or saline were injected into the ischemic hindlimb of athymic nude rats 1 day after left common iliac artery ligation. Results Although conventional dialysis cell injection had no effect versus saline, nocturnal hemodialysis and healthy control cell injection significantly improved ischemic hindlimb perfusion and capillary density. Nocturnal hemodialysis cell injection was also associated with significant increases in endogenous angio-poietin 1 expression in the ischemic hindlimb compared with saline and conventional dialysis cell injection. Conclusions In contrast to a conventional dialytic regimen, nocturnal hemodialysis is associated with a sig-nificantly improved ability of early-outgrowth endothelial progenitor-like cells to promote angiogenesis and thus restore perfusion in a model of ischemic vascular disease...|$|E
40|$|Micronutrients—minerals and vitamins—have {{been used}} for centuries for {{medicinal}} purposes, although only {{over the last decade}} have research-ers paid significant attention to micronutrients as a primary treatment for mental illness. 1 Despite the positive benefits associated with micronutrients, some factors may limit a positive response, one of which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> the overgrowth of intestinal Candida. This yeast can disrupt normal gastroin-testinal functioning through overproduction of acetalde-hyde, and in turn, diminish nutrient absorption. 2 Theoretically, a nutritional treatment for psychiatric symp-toms would not be as effective in the presence of such an infection. Candida is a common fungal infection, with increased prevalence being associated with increased use of antibiot-ics. 3 Estimates suggest that up to 75 % of women will experi-ence at least one episode of vaginal Candida in their life-times. The idea <b>that</b> Candida <b>may</b> <b>be</b> associated with psychi-atric symptoms is not a new one. 4 A number of studies have documented elevated psychiatric symptoms in individuals infected with Candida, including high rates of panic attacks, depression, and poor concentration 2, 5, 6; however, the causal direction <b>is</b> unclear and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> bidirectional. Furthermore, not all studies have convincingly shown a relationship between remission of Candida infection and improvement in psychiatric symptoms. 7 Regardless, Candida has never been discussed in studies on nutrient treatments as a possible limiting factor.

In the present study, male and female 8 – 13 years old (mean = 11. 0 years) children with ADHD (n= 33) and typically developing (TD) children (n= 24) performed a visual emotional working memory (n-back) task with 2 memory loads and three different background pictures (neutral/positive/negative), and trait anxiety measures were obtained. Children with ADHD performed less well, and displayed increased emotional interference in the presence of aversive distractors when compared with TD children.

40|$|Hsp 90 is a dimeric ATPase {{responsible}} for the activation or maturation of {{a specific set of}} substrate proteins termed ‘clients’.

Co-chaperone proteins regulate conformational transitions <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>impaired</b> in mutant forms of Hsp 90. We report here that the in vivo impairment of commonly studied Hsp 90 variants harbouring the G 313 S or A 587 T mutation are exacerbated by the co-chaperone Hch 1 p. Deletion of HCH 1, but not AHA 1, mitigates the temperature sensitive phenotype and high sensitivity to Hsp 90 inhibitor drugs observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that express either of these two Hsp 90 variants. Moreover, the deletion of HCH 1 results in high resistance to Hsp 90 inhibitors in yeast that express wildtype Hsp 90. Conversely, the overexpression of Hch 1 p greatly increases sensitivity to Hsp 90 inhibition in yeast expressing wildtype Hsp 90. We conclude that despite the similarity between these two co-chaperones, Hch 1 p and Aha 1 p regulate Hsp 90 function in distinct ways and likely independent of their roles as ATPase stimulators. We further conclude that Hch 1 p plays a critical role in regulating Hsp 90 inhibitor drug sensitivity in yeast...|$|E

Aims: To establish whether arousability was altered by method of feeding, and whether breast fed infants would have lower arousal thresholds. Methods: Forty three healthy term infants were studied using daytime polysomnography on three occasions: 2 – 4 weeks post-term, 2 – 3 months post-term, and 5 – 6 months post-term. Multiple measure-ments of arousal threshold (cm H 2 O) in response to nasal air jet stimulation applied alternately to the nares were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) while infants slept supine. Arousal thresholds and sleep period lengths were compared between formula fed and breast fed infants at each age. Results: Arousal thresholds were not different between breast fed and formula fed infants in QS. However, in AS breast fed infants were significantly more arousable than formula fed infants at 2 – 3 months of age.

40|$|Store-operated Ca(2 +) {{channels}} (SOCs) are voltage-independent Ca(2 +) channels activated upon {{depletion of}} the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2 +) stores. Early studies suggest the contribution of such channels to Ca(2 +) homeostasis in insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells. However, their composition and contribution to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) remains unclear. In this study, endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2 +) depletion triggered by acetylcholine (ACh) or thapsigargin stimulated {{the formation of a}} ternary complex composed of Orai 1, TRPC 1, and STIM 1, the key proteins involved in the formation of SOCs. Ca(2 +) imaging further revealed that Orai 1 and TRPC 1 are required to form functional SOCs and that these channels are activated by STIM 1 in response to thapsigargin or ACh. Pharmacological SOCs inhibition or dominant negative blockade of Orai 1 or TRPC 1 using the specific pore mutants Orai 1 -E 106 D and TRPC 1 -F 562 A impaired GSIS in rat β-cells and fully blocked the potentiating effect of ACh on secretion. In contrast, pharmacological or dominant negative blockade of TRPC 3 had no effect on extracellular Ca(2 +) entry and GSIS. Finally, we observed that prolonged exposure to supraphysiological glucose concentration impaired SOCs function without altering the expression levels of STIM 1, Orai 1, and TRPC 1. We conclude that Orai 1 and TRPC 1, which form SOCs regulated by STIM 1, {{play a key role in}} the effect of ACh on GSIS, a process <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>impaired</b> in type 2 diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) affects {{patients}} {{beyond the}} motor domain. According to previous evidence, one mechanism <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>impaired</b> in {{the disease is}} face processing. However, few studies have investigated this process at the neural level in PD. Moreover, research using dynamic facial displays rather than static pictures is scarce, but highly warranted due to the higher ecological validity of dynamic stimuli. In the present study we aimed to investigate how PD patients process emotional and non-emotional dynamic face stimuli at the neural level using event-related potentials. Since the literature has revealed a predominantly right-lateralized network for dynamic face processing, we divided the group into patients with left (LPD) and right (RPD) motor symptom onset (right versus left cerebral hemisphere predominantly affected, respectively). Participants watched short video clips of happy, angry, and neutral expressions and engaged in a shallow gender decision task {{in order to avoid}} confounds of task difficulty in the data. In line with our expectations, the LPD group showed significant face processing deficits compared to controls. While there were no group differences in early, sensory-driven processing (fronto-central N 1 and posterior P 1), the vertex positive potential, which is considered the fronto-central counterpart of the face-specific posterior N 170 component, had a reduced amplitude and delayed latency in the LPD group. This may indicate disturbances of structural face processing in LPD. Furthermore, the effect was independent of the emotional content of the videos. In contrast, static facial identity recognition performance in LPD was not significantly different from controls, and comprehensive testing of cognitive functions did not reveal any deficits in this group. We therefore conclude that PD, and more specifically the predominant right-hemispheric affection in left-onset PD, is associated with impaired processing of dynamic facial expressions, which {{could be one of the}} mechanisms behind the often reported problems of PD patients in their social lives...|$|E

However, other viral proteins are expressed in most organs and tissues, and are found in the circulating blood. Since HIV- 1 targets the immune system in humans, we examined two immunological parameters, leukocyte-endothelial adhesion (LEA) and inflammatory cytokine production, in 5 mo old HIV- 1 Tg rats to identify immune functions <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>impaired</b> even before the onset of symptoms of HIV- 1 infection. We administered a single injection (i. p.) of the bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 250 ug/kg), to 5 mo old HIV- 1 Tg rats, age-matched transgenic control (Tg) rats, and F 344 /NHsd (F 344) control background strain rats. LPS induced an LEA response in both the Tg control and F 344 control animals. However, in the HIV- 1 Tg rats, there was no LEA response to LPS. Following LPS administration, there was significantly greater serum levels of TNF-&# 945; and IL- 1 &# 946;, two pro-inflammatory cytokines, in the HIV- 1 Tg rats compared to the control animals. In contrast, the serum level of IL- 10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was comparable in the HIV- 1 Tg, Tg control, and F 344 control rats. Our data show that, in the HIV- 1 Tg rat, there is a negative correlation between the LEA response and the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to bacterial endotoxin. These findings suggest that the persistent presence of viral proteins may be, at least, partially responsible for the immunodeficiency that occurs with HIV- 1 infection, and that the HIV- 1 Tg rat could be a valid rodent model in which to study various aspects of HIV- 1 infection...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between parental drinking and school adjustment in a total population sample of adolescents, with independent reports from mothers, fathers, and adolescents. As a group, children of alcohol abusers have previously been found to exhibit lowered academic achievement. However, few studies address which parts of school adjustment <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>impaired.</b> Both a genetic approach and social strains predict elevated problem scores in these children. Previous research has had limitations such as only recruiting cases from clinics, relying on single responders for all measures, or incomplete control for comorbid psychopathology. The specific effects of maternal and paternal alcohol use are also understudied. Methods In a Norwegian county, 88 % of the population aged 13 - 19 years participated in a health survey (N = 8984). Among other variables, adolescents reported on four dimensions of school adjustment, while mothers and fathers reported their own drinking behaviour. Mental distress and other control variables were adjusted for. Multivariate analysis including generalized estimation equations was applied to investigate associations. Results Compared to children of light drinkers, children of alcohol abusers had moderately elevated attention and conduct problem scores. Maternal alcohol abuse was particularly predictive of such problems. Children of abstainers did significantly better than children of light drinkers. Controlling for adolescent mental distress reduced the association between maternal abuse and attention problems. The associations between parental reported drinking and school adjustment were further reduced when controlling for the children's report of seeing their parents drunk, which itself predicted school adjustment. Controlling for parental mental distress did not reduce the associations. Conclusions Parental alcohol abuse is an independent risk factor for attention and conduct problems at school. Some of the risk associated with mothers' drinking {{is likely to be}} mediated by adolescent mental distress. Despite lowered adjustment on the externalizing dimensions, children of alcohol abusers report that they enjoy being at school as much as other children. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Speed of processing, one of {{the main}} {{cognitive}} deficits in schizophrenia is most frequently measured with a digit symbol-coding test. Performance on this test is additionally affected by writing speed and the rate at which symbol digit relationships are learned, two factors <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>impaired</b> in schizophrenia. This study aims to investigate the effects of sensorimotor speed, short-term learning, and long-term learning on task performance in schizophrenia. In addition, the study aims to explore differences in learning effects between patients with schizophrenia and elderly individuals. Methods: Patients with schizophrenia (N = 30) were compared with age-matched healthy controls (N = 30) and healthy elderly volunteers (N = 30) during the Symbol Digit Substitution Test (SDST). The task was administered on a digitizing tablet, allowing precise measurements of the time taken to write each digit (writing time) and the time to decode symbols into their corresponding digits (matching time). The SDST was administered on three separate days (day 1, day 2, day 7). Symbol digit repetitions during the task represented short-term learning and repeating the task on different days represented long-term learning. Results: The repetition of the same symbol digit combinations within one test and the repetition of the test over days resulted in significant decreases in matching time. Interestingly, these short-term and long-term learning effects were about equal among the three groups. Individual participants showed a large variation in the rate of short-term learning. In general, patients with schizophrenia had the longest matching time whereas the elderly had the longest writing time. Writing time remained the same over repeated testing. Conclusion: The rate of learning and sensorimotor speed was found to have a substantial influence on the SDST score. However, a large individual variation in learning rate should be taken into account in the interpretation of task scores for processing speed. Equal learning rates among the three groups suggest that unintentional learning in schizophrenia and in the elderly is preserved. These findings are important for the design of rehabilitation programs for schizophrenia...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive {{impairment}} is a prevalent comorbidity seen in elderly {{heart failure}} (HF) patients and {{is linked to}} poor quality of life, reduced self-care abilities and increased hospital readmissions, possibly due to a reduced capacity to understand and follow complex treatment protocols. In addition to cognitive impairments, HF patients also endure depressed mood and increased anxiety. In order to establish the most effective treatment for improving or ameliorating cognitive impairment and mood in older HF patients, {{a better understanding of}} the basic physiological mechanisms is necessary. Previous research suggests that mechanisms underlying cognitive impairments in these patients include reduced cerebral blood flow but little is known about the influence of other processes on their cognitive impairments. The aim of the present thesis was to examine whether inflammatory, antioxidant, oxidative stress and arterial stiffness explain cognitive deficits and depressed mood and anxiety in elderly HF. A further aim was to explore additional cognitive domains <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>impaired</b> in HF using a well-validated computerised neuropsychological assessment battery. In this thesis, 36 patients with HF (NYHA class II, III or IV) aged 60 years and above were compared to 40 age- and sex- matched controls on tests of cognitive function, mood and several biological mechanisms including cerebral blood flow, arterial stiffness, inflammation, oxidative stress and antioxidant markers. The results indicated that Power of Attention is an additional cognitive domain impaired in elderly HF patients. Determinable reactive oxygen metabolites (DROMs) are significantly elevated in HF compared to controls. Furthermore, the results indicated that reduced common carotid arterial blood flow velocity, arterial stiffness and reduced coenzyme Q 10 levels were related to poor attention and psychomotor abilities in elderly HF patients. Common carotid arterial blood flow velocity and reduced circulating coenzyme Q 10 were associated with reduced executive function in HF. Although inflammation and oxidative stress were significantly elevated in the HF group, there was no indication these biomarkers were related to cognitive function. Finally, the results indicated that cerebral blood flow, arterial stiffness, antioxidants and inflammatory makers did not relate to depression or anxiety levels in HF. In conclusion, this thesis confirmed the existence of cognitive impairments in HF, and suggested that Power of Attention may be a further, previously undescribed impairment. These findings also indicate that DROMs are a useful measure of oxidative stress in older HF patients, and those interventions that reduce central pulse pressure, increase cerebral blood flow and elevate coenzyme Q 10 levels may improve attention and executive function in elderly HF patients...|$|E
40|$|To {{substantiate}} {{a previously}} reported disturbance of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in chronic schizophrenia, plasma growth hormone (GH) {{response to a}} direct GABA agonist (baclofen, 10 mg) was assessed in 12 unmedicated chronic schizophrenic males and 10 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Baclofen and placebo were administered orally, in a double-blind design, and blood samples were collected before and 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min after drug or placebo administration. Baclofen induced a clear-cut rise in plasma GH levels over baseline values, but the GH increase observed in the patients was significantly smaller than that in controls. These results support the idea <b>that</b> GABA mechanisms <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>impaired</b> in chronic schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Does {{intentional}} {{car following}} capture visual {{attention to the}} extent <b>that</b> driving <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>impaired?</b> We tested fifteen participants on a rudimentary driving simulator. Participants were either instructed to follow a vehicle ahead through a simulated version of London, or were given verbal instructions on where to turn during the route. The {{presence or absence of}} pedestrians, and the simulated time of the drive (day or night) were varied across the trials. Eye movements were recorded along with behavioural measures including give-way violations, give-way accidents, and kerb impacts. The results revealed that intentional car following reduced the spread of search and increased fixation durations, with a dramatic increase in the time spent processing the vehicle ahead (controlled for exposure). The effects were most pronounced during nighttime drives. During the car-following trials participants were also less aware of pedestrians, produced more give-way violations, and were involved in more give-way accidents. The results draw attention to the problems encountered during car following, and we relate this to the cognitive demands placed on drivers, especially police drivers who often engage in intentional car following and pursuits. ...|$|R
40|$|B-lymphocyte {{maturation}} {{is considered}} to be independent of the thymus. However, there is circumstantial evidence suggesting <b>that</b> it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>impaired</b> in nude animals that lack the thymus. Our study shows that the proportion of immature B-lymphocyte subsets (CD 90 high IgMhigh and CD 90 high IgMlow) was significantly increased, whereas that of mature B-lymphocyte subsets (CD 90 – IgMlow and CD 90 – IgMhigh) was decreased in the blood and lymph nodes of nude rats. In addition, the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, CD 44 and l-selectin was significantly down-regulated both on immature and mature B-lymphocyte subsets. After implantation of thymic tissue under the kidney capsule of nude rats the block in B-lymphocyte maturation was alleviated and the expression of surface molecules was normalized. Comparable effects were seen after the adoptive transfer of T lymphocytes. Thus, we show that in nude rats B cells do not mature properly {{because of the lack of}} T-cell help and that T lymphocytes are required for the peripheral phase of B-lymphocyte maturation, as well as for the appropriate expression of surface molecules. This should be considered when treating patients with T-cell deficiencies...|$|R
