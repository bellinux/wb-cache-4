Her person was graceful her features beautiful and their expression such as to heighten the eloquence of every thing she said.

500|$|Brian Crecente, {{editor-in-chief}} of Kotaku, praised the general use of {{light as a}} gameplay-mechanic. He commented on the episodic structure, saying it made the player feel satisfied even after short gameplay sessions. He also praised the overall storyline, having played the final episode thrice in a row, saying: [...] "For the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> <b>I</b> have experienced something that plays like a game but has {{the impact of a}} movie... Alan Wake is a powerful ride, an experience bound to leave you thinking about it and wanting more for days after its completion." [...] He criticised the game for not providing enough information about Wake and his wife, despite being [...] "packed with memorable people", but concluded that the game [...] "redefines interactive storytelling".|$|E

[...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from the}} several actors playing paparazzi {{throughout}} the video, Hunter included several shots of actual French paparazzi on scooters, {{who attempted to}} photograph Carey during the video's filming. Hunter claimed the additions made the video feel more realistic. For the video's primary filming locations, Carey had Louis Vuitton's flagship store on Champs-Élysées, {{one of the most}} prestigious avenues in Paris, shut down. When describing the experience filming in the boutique, Carey explained: [...] "Obviously, being able to take your pick of anything in the store and have the whole store shut down for you is every girl's dream. You know, just a pretty standard {{day in the life of}} anybody. No, just joking.

500|$|In {{the third}} match, in Bridgetown, Barbados, Boycott was to face what was later {{said to be}} Holding's {{greatest}} over. Boycott was hit on the gloves by the first delivery, played-and-missed the second outside off stump, was hit on the thigh by the third, fended the next two deliveries away with his bat, and was then bowled by the final delivery. Though in 1987 Boycott would claim a 1966 delivery by Gary Sobers {{to be the best}} he ever faced in cricket, he noted of Holding's over that [...] "for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>I</b> can look at a scoreboard with a duck against my name and not feel a profound sense of failure." [...] Boycott led an England fight back in the fourth Test. Having watched Holding's over several times on video, and worked in the nets on his game, Boycott came out and made 38 in the first innings and then hit his twentieth Test century. His career run total was now 7,410, gaining on Gary Sobers' record of 8,032.|$|E

It was recorded at MSR Studios and Jungle City Studios in New York City, New York.

Beginning on June 16 to June 27, 2011, the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Knowles' official website, paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and an insightful quote. On June 22, 2011, [...] "Start Over" [...] was the fourth song to be chosen. The quote found Knowles elaborating on what motivated her to record a song like [...] "Start Over": [...] "For the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>I</b> was able to travel the world, hear different influences, see different types of dance and choreography and taste different types of food.

500|$|As {{the record}} neared {{completion}} by August 2003, the band performed {{for a short}} time for the armed forces in the Middle East and premiered more new songs at their Reading and Leeds sets. The trio shot small, home-made videos for several songs on Blink-182, as well as the official music video for [...] "Feeling This", the song they picked as the first single. The band spent time to finalize the CD booklet and album artwork in September. Mark Hoppus stated that the album was so [...] "personal to all three of us that we really wanted to be involved in every aspect of it." [...] The release date kept getting missed and pushed back to the point where Jordan Schur, then-president of Geffen Records, made calls asking, [...] "What is the absolute last possible second that we can turn this thing in and still make our release date?" [...] DeLonge described the final days of mixing the album as [...] "crazy stressful", with [...] "literally hours to turn [...] to have it come it out on time." [...] The album was in production so late that final mixes were still being judged by Hoppus, DeLonge, and Barker the night before the album was sent to the pressing plant. For Barker, he later considered it his favorite time in the band's history, commenting, [...] "That was a good <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> <b>I</b> was smoking just enough weed and taking just enough pills." ...|$|E
500|$|Brosnan {{also raises}} money for {{charitable}} causes through sales of his paintings. After Brosnan left school, he pursued {{a career in}} art and began working as an illustrator. “I {{always wanted to be}} an artist, a painter. I started as a Trainee Artist in a small studio in South London.” A colleague suggested that Pierce attend a theatre workshop, and eventually he abandoned his artwork to pursue a career in acting. Brosnan took up painting again in the late 1980s during his first wife’s illness as he found it therapeutic. “Sometimes dramatic moments affect the way you see yourself in the world…from a very hard <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> <b>I</b> started painting again and out came every color I could imagine.” Citing his influences as Picasso, Matisse, Bonnard and Kandinsky, Brosnan spends much of his free time between film shoots in front of his easel. “I am self taught, an enthusiastic painter as a friend of mine likes to say.” [...] He has continued painting since then, using spare time on set and at home. Profits from sales of giclée prints of his works are given to a trust to benefit [...] "environmental, children's and women's health charities." [...] Since Harris' death, Brosnan has been an advocate for cancer awareness and, in 2006, he served as spokesperson for Lee National Denim Day, a breast cancer fundraiser which raises millions of dollars and raises more money in a single day than any other breast cancer fundraiser.|$|E
500|$|From August 2, {{the conference}} debated whether Peng should be disciplined, what {{punishment}} Peng should receive, {{and for what}} reasons. On August 16 the conference passed two resolutions. The first resolution condemned Peng {{as the leader of}} an [...] "anti-Party clique", and called for Peng's removal from the positions of Defense Minister and Vice-Chairman of the Military Commission. The resolution did not eject Peng from the Communist Party, and it allowed Peng to retain his position in the Politburo, but he was excluded from Politburo meetings for years. The second resolution recognized Mao's dominance within the Party and subtly {{called for an end to}} the policies of the Great Leap Forward. After Mao had rallied the rest of the Party against him, Peng's options were limited to stubbornly standing his ground, engaging in a humiliating self-criticism, or suicide. After private discussion with other senior leaders, Peng considered the prestige of Mao and the unity of the Party and agreed to make a self-criticism, which was publicly reviewed at the conference, in which he admitted that he had made [...] "severe mistakes" [...] associated with his [...] "rightist viewpoint", that he had been a follower of Li Lisan and Wang Ming, and in which he openly implicated his supporters in his [...] "mistakes". After the conference, Peng said privately to Zhou Enlai regarding his self-criticism: [...] "For the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> <b>I</b> have spoken out against my very heart!" [...] Mao purged most of Peng's supporters from important offices following the conference, almost completely isolating Peng politically for the rest of his life. Peng later reflected that he was confused that Mao could have interpreted his private letter as a political attack, and wondered why, after thirty years of working together, Mao could not have discussed the matter privately with him, if Peng had indeed made the mistakes Mao claimed he did.|$|E

500|$|In September 2000, {{she joined}} the ABT Studio Company, which is ABT's second company, and {{became a member of}} its Corps de ballet in 2001. As part of the Studio Company, she {{performed}} the Pas de Deux in Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty. Eight months after joining the company, she was sidelined for nearly a year by a lumbar stress fracture. When Copeland joined the company, she weighed [...] (she is [...] tall). At age 19, her puberty had been delayed, a situation common in ballet dancers. After the lumbar fracture, her doctor told her that inducing puberty would help to strengthen her bones, and he prescribed birth control pills. Copeland recalls that in one month she gained 10 pounds, and her small breasts swelled to double D-cup size: [...] "Leotards had to be altered for me ... to cover my cleavage, for instance. I hated this sign that I was different from the others. ... I became so self-conscious that, for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> <b>I</b> couldn’t dance strong. I was too busy trying to hide my breasts." [...] Management noticed and called her in to talk about her body. The professional pressure to conform to conventional ballet aesthetics resulted in body image struggles and a binge eating disorder. Copeland says that, over the next year, new friendships outside of ABT, including with Victoria Rowell and her boyfriend, Olu Evans, helped her to regain confidence in her body. She explained, [...] "My curves became an integral part of who I am as a dancer, not something I needed to lose to become one. I started dancing with confidence and joy, and soon the staff at ABT began giving me positive feedback again. And I think I changed everyone’s mind about what a perfect dancer is supposed to look like." [...] During her years in the corps, as the only Black woman in the company, Copeland also felt the burden of her ethnicity in many ways and contemplated a variety of career choices. Recognizing that Copeland's isolation and self-doubt were {{standing in the way of}} her talent, ABT's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, asked writer and arts figure Susan Fales-Hill, then vice-chair of ABT's Board of Directors, to mentor Copeland. Fales-Hill introduced Copeland to Black women trailblazers who encouraged Copeland and helped her to gain perspective.|$|E

Knocked off his board, he could not recover properly and came close to passing out. A companion came to his aid and Blake accepted a ride back to shore, without his board, which eventually washed up on shore, badly nicked.

2500|$|He {{undertook}} {{the role}} of Bosambo in the movie Sanders of the River, which he felt would render a realistic view of colonial African culture. His friends in the anti-imperialism movement and association with British socialists led him to visit the Soviet Union. Robeson, Essie, and Marie Seton traveled to the Soviet Union on an invitation from Sergei Eisenstein in December 1934. A stopover in Berlin enlightened Robeson to the racism in Nazi Germany and, on his arrival in Moscow, in the Soviet Union, Robeson said, [...] "Here I am not a Negro but a human being for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life..</b> <b>I</b> walk in full human dignity."

[...] Lennon described it as [...] "more of Paul's granny music". In 1994, McCartney said that the song merely epitomises the downfalls of life, being [...] "my analogy for when something goes wrong out of the blue, as it so often does, as I was beginning to find out at that <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> <b>I</b> wanted something symbolic of that, so {{to me it was}} some fictitious character called Maxwell with a silver hammer.
