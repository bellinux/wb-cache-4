40|$|SummaryAggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide into soluble and {{insoluble}} forms {{within the}} brain extracellular space {{is central to}} the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP) is endocytosed from the cell surface into endosomes where it is cleaved to produce Aβ. Aβ is subsequently released into the brain interstitial fluid (ISF). We hypothesized that synaptic <b>transmission</b> results <b>in</b> more APP endocytosis, thereby increasing Aβ generation and release into the ISF. We found that inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis immediately lowers ISF Aβ levels in vivo. Two distinct methods that increased synaptic <b>transmission</b> resulted <b>in</b> an <b>elevation</b> of ISF Aβ levels. Inhibition of endocytosis, however, prevented the activity-dependent increase in Aβ. We estimate that ∼ 70 % of ISF Aβ arises from endocytosis-associated mechanisms, with the vast majority of this pool also dependent on synaptic activity. These findings have implications for AD pathogenesis and may provide insights into therapeutic intervention...|$|R

40|$|An adaptive-antenna array {{provides}} an e~ective means of suppressing interj+erence signals. However, in medium- to long-range HF communications, sky-wave propagation often produces multipath that can hamper effective interference suppression. The differential time delays and elevation separations between paths vary widely {{depending on which}} reflecting ionospheric layers are active during the <b>transmission.</b> <b>In</b> mid-range sky-wave propagation (about 1000 km) where single-hop transmissions are dominant, the time-delay differences between paths increase with the elevation-angle differences. When adaptive weights are calculated based on an embedded known reference in the waveform, {{it is possible to}} resolve the multiple paths <b>in</b> <b>elevation,</b> based on the di~erential time delays. This can be achieved by forming composite antenna-pattern nulls pointing towards unwanted-signal paths in the vertical plane. The selection of a desirable signal path is made based on its specific time delay. Nulls are also formed towards all the paths of the interference signals. When the paths are close <b>in</b> <b>elevation,</b> a three-dimensional antenna-array arrangement can be used to enhance the vertical resolution. This paper characterizes multipath propagation based on a mid-range sky- wave scenario and investigates, by computer simulation, how antenna-array configuration aflects the suppression of unwanted multipath components of the desired signal in the presence of interference...|$|R
