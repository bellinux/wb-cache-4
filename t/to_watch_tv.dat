25|$|In {{this case}} {{there are two}} pure Nash equilibria: either both swerve to the left, or both swerve to the right. In this example, it doesn't matter which side both players pick, {{as long as they}} both pick the same. Both {{solutions}} are Pareto efficient. This is not true for all coordination games, as the pure coordination game in Fig. 3 shows. Pure (or common interest) coordination is the game where the players both prefer the same Nash equilibrium outcome, here both players prefer partying over both staying at home <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>TV.</b> The {Party, Party} outcome Pareto dominates the {Home, Home} outcome, just as both Pareto dominate the other two outcomes, {Party, Home} and {Home, Party}.|$|E

25|$|Al Jazeera's {{availability}} (via satellite) {{throughout the}} Middle East changed the television {{landscape of the}} region. Prior {{to the arrival of}} Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>TV</b> channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of freedom of speech on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program El-Itidjah el-Mouakass ("The Opposite Direction"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen.|$|E

500|$|In the California Medical Facility, Kemper was incarcerated in {{the same}} prison block as other notorious criminals such as Herbert Mullin and Charles Manson. Kemper showed {{particular}} disdain for Mullin, who committed his murders {{at the same time}} in Santa Cruz as Kemper. He described Mullin as [...] "just a cold-blooded killer... killing everybody he saw for no good reason". However, Kemper himself commented on his [...] "self-righteous talking like that , considering what [...] done". Despite this concession, Kemper still manipulated and physically intimidated the diminutive Mullin, who, standing at , was over a foot shorter than Kemper. Kemper stated that [...] " [...] had a habit of singing and bothering people when somebody tried <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>TV,</b> so I threw water on him to shut him up. Then, when he was a good boy, I'd give him peanuts. Herbie liked peanuts. That was effective, because pretty soon he asked permission to sing. That's called behavior modification treatment." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott D. Pierce of the Deseret News praised Kim Possible as [...] "an {{entertaining}} {{show that}} should indeed appeal to tweens, younger kids {{and even their}} parents" [...] that [...] "plays with the superhero format {{in a way that}} doesn't take itself too seriously but doesn't play down to the viewers." [...] Tracy McLoone of PopMatters reviewed, [...] "Kim Possible includes adult-friendly humor, in the event that parents feel the need <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>tv</b> (sic) with their kids. But nobody in or watching the series will ever be offended or over-stimulated, or even surprised." [...] While accepting main character Kim as a positive role model and acknowledging that the series sometimes teaches [...] "good lessons", Besty Wallace of Common Sense Media expressed concern about the show's emphasis on action and violence, explaining, [...] "lessons may get muddled and nearly lost as the heroes shimmy up rope ladders dangling from helicopters and dodge spinning tops of doom. As long as you're not expecting too {{much in the way of}} educational value, you'll probably have plenty of fun with this one." [...] Writing for Bustle, Sarah Freymiller opined, [...] "Ultimately, Kim Possible was just a solid show. It didn't skimp on plot or dialogue in favor of Wile E. Coyote explosions, and its tongue-in-cheek humor allowed it to be self-aware and hip at the same time." [...] Conversely, Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection Among Girls author Lyn Mikel Brown was less receptive towards Kim herself, criticizing the show for promoting the beautiful and thin heroine as [...] "your basic average girl" [...] and apparent reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the fact that her [...] "biggest threat" [...] is Bonnie as opposed to evil. According to Brown, [...] "Being the kind of girl who's accepted or befriended by boys underscores a girl's power and sets her against other girls." ...|$|E

5000|$|LC {{shutter glasses}} are {{shutting}} out light {{half of the}} time; moreover, they are slightly dark even when letting light through, because they are polarized.
