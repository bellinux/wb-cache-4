5|$|After the Scilly naval {{disaster}} of 1707 where four ships ran aground due to navigational mistakes, the British government offered a large prize of £20,000, equivalent <b>to</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> pounds today, {{for anyone who}} could determine longitude accurately. The reward was eventually claimed in 1761 by Yorkshire carpenter John Harrison, who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change is}} the {{variation}} in global or regional climates over time.

Changes over time scales of a year or more mostly reflect changes in the Earth's interior, particularly the iron-rich core.|$|E

In 1991, Holley was the singing voice of Choir Boy in the Robert Townsend movie, The Five Heartbeats. His stage presence and vocal ability were praised by music critics during such performances.|$|E
5|$|Michael was {{perceived}} as unremarkable, quiet and good-natured. He performed the usual public duties expected of an heir to the throne. In 1901, he represented Russia at the funeral of Queen Victoria and was given the Order of the Bath. The following year he was made a Knight of the Garter in King Edward VII's coronation honours. In June 1902, Michael transferred to the Blue Cuirassier Regiment and moved to Gatchina, where the regiment was based. Since coming of age, Michael had assumed financial independence. His assets included the largest sugar refinery in the country, capital amounting <b>to</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> roubles, a collection of motor vehicles, and country estates at Otrovo in Russian Poland and Brasovo near Orel.|$|E
5|$|By 1933, the Nazi Party was {{the largest}} elected party in the German Reichstag and led to Hitler's {{appointment}} as Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. He aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter {{what he saw as}} the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I and the annexation of territories that were home <b>to</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> ethnic Germans which gave him significant popular support.|$|E

5|$|In {{the history}} of popular music, there are a {{relative}} handful of performers who have redefined {{the content of the}} music at critical points in history—people whose music left the landscape, and definition of popular music, altered completely. The Kingston Trio were one such group, transforming folk music into a hot commodity and creating a demand—where none had existed before—for young men (sometimes with women) strumming acoustic guitars and banjos and singing folk songs and folk-like novelty songs in harmony. On a purely commercial level, from 1957 until 1963, the Kingston Trio were the most vital and popular folk group in the world, and folk music was sufficiently popular as to make that a significant statement. Equally important, the original trio—Dave Guard, Nick Reynolds, and Bob Shane—in tandem with other, similar early acts such as the Limeliters, spearheaded a boom in the popularity of folk music that suddenly made the latter important <b>to</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> listeners who previously had ignored it.|$|E
5|$|On 9June 2004, the {{day after}} the first of a 21st-century pair of Venus transits {{occurred}} as predicted by Horrocks, a commemorative street nameplate in memory of William Crabtree was unveiled at the junction of Lower Broughton Road and Priory Grove, which marks the northern boundary of Crabtree Croft. In December 2005, a commemorative plaque was unveiled a few yards away near Ivy Cottage on Lower Broughton Road, which is thought to have been the home of Crabtree and his family {{at the time he was}} collaborating with Horrocks. The second transit of the pair occurred on 5 and 6June 2012, and was marked by a celebration held in the church at Much Hoole, which was streamed live worldwide on the NASA website. A celebration was also held at Crabtree's former home in Broughton when NASA broadcast a re-creation of the observation at Ivy Cottage, inspired by the Ford Madox Brown mural, <b>to</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> viewers, and projected a live video stream of the transit from Hawaii onto the side of the house.|$|E
