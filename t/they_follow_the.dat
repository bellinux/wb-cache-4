The Master Chief disobeys orders to stand down and relinquish the malfunctioning Cortana, and stays behind {{to oppose the}} Didact. Infinity executive officer Commander Lasky gives Chief an armed transport and wishes him luck. Chief and Cortana attempt to sabotage the Didact's ship before he leaves, but when they are unsuccessful <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> Didact to a Halo ring, Installation 03.

5|$|As one road, NY14 and NY414 travel down Franklin Street, {{the main}} {{thoroughfare}} of Watkins Glen. The routes pass by several blocks of homes as <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> western {{base of the}} ravine and meet {{the east end of}} NY329, which ascends the side of the valley to serve Watkins Glen State Park. NY414 continues to follow NY14 to Watkins Glen's central business district, where NY414 splits from the overlap to travel east at an intersection that also acts as the eastern terminus of NY409. From this point north, NY14 and NY414 follow opposite sides of Seneca Lake, with NY414 running along the east lake shore.|$|E
5|$|In Vagrant Story, the Iocus priesthood of {{the kingdom}} of Valendia is shown to use the Kildean rood as a symbol, {{although}} <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> teachings of a saint named Iocus instead of the original Kildean teachings of the Kiltia religion of Leá Monde. Müllenkamp, founder of the city of Leá Monde featured in the story, used to be a priestess of Kiltia, and bore the rood on her back. The followers of St. Iocus are outwardly intolerant of magic, seeing it as an abomination, and yet its higher members continue to use it behind the scenes. This hypocrisy is revealed {{over the course of the}} story, though it goes unresolved.|$|E
5|$|Khmer {{is written}} with the Khmer script, an abugida {{developed}} from the Pallava script of India before the 7th century when the first known inscription appeared. Written left-to-right with vowel signs that can be placed after, before, above or below the consonant <b>they</b> <b>follow,</b> <b>the</b> Khmer script is similar in appearance and usage to Thai and Lao, {{both of which were}} based on the Khmer system. The Khmer script is also distantly related to the Mon script, the ancestor of the modern Burmese script. Khmer numerals, which were inherited from Indian numerals, are used more widely than Hindu-Arabic numerals. Within Cambodia, literacy in the Khmer alphabet is estimated at 77.6%.|$|E

5|$|Like {{other wines}} {{produced}} in the United States, Oregon wines are marketed as varietals. Oregon law requires that wines {{produced in the}} state must be identified by the grape variety from which it was made, and for most varietals it must contain at least 90% of that variety. The exceptions to the 90% law are the following varietals: Red and White Bordeaux varietals, Red and White Rhône varietals, Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Zinfandel and Tannat. For these wines, <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> Federal guidelines of 75%. Oregon law has long forbidden use of place names, except as appellations of origin. Oregon is most famous for its Pinot noir, which is produced throughout the state. Pinot noirs from the Willamette Valley have received much critical acclaim from wine connoisseurs and critics, and Oregon is {{regarded as one of}} the premier Pinot-producing regions in the world.|$|E
5|$|Ernest Augustus, {{the fifth}} son of King George III and Queen Charlotte, {{was born at}} Buckingham House, now part of Buckingham Palace, on 5 June 1771. After leaving the nursery, {{he lived with his}} two younger brothers, Prince Adolphus (later Duke of Cambridge) and Prince Augustus (later Duke of Sussex), and a tutor in a house on Kew Green, near his parents' {{residence}} at Kew Palace. At the age of fifteen, he and his two younger brothers were sent to the University of Göttingen, located in his father's domain of Hanover. Though the King never left the United Kingdom in his life, he sent his younger sons to Germany in their adolescence. According to the historian John Van der Kiste, this was done to limit the influence Ernest's eldest brother George, Prince of Wales, who was leading an extravagant lifestyle, would have over his younger brothers. Prince Ernest proved an apt student, and after being tutored privately for a year, while learning German, he attended lectures at the University. Though King George ordered that the princes' household be run along military lines, and that <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> university's rules, the merchants of the Electorate proved willing to extend credit to the princes, and all three fell into debt.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sarah and Casey {{learn that}} Ned is {{unmarried}} and had earlier called Mauser {{rather than his}} wife, as the hostages were led to believe. <b>They</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> ambulance containing Chuck and Mauser and shoot its tires, sending the vehicle into a Christmas tree lot and allowing Chuck to escape. After a brief fight, Mauser surrenders, confident that Fulcrum will rescue him. To protect Chuck, Sarah executes Mauser. Unknown to Sarah, Chuck watches the entire confrontation in horror from afar. She lies to Chuck and tells him that Mauser has been arrested. At the Buy More, Ellie and Morgan's girlfriend Anna Wu (Julia Ling) praise Lester for his act of bravery. Morgan watches as Lester grabs Anna and kisses her, turning away before Anna pulls away from Lester in disgust. The episode closes with both Morgan and Chuck heartbroken, Morgan believing Anna to be unfaithful, and Chuck believing Sarah to be a murderer.|$|E

5|$|Deshastha Brahmins {{fall under}} the Pancha Dravida Brahmin {{classification}} of the Brahmin community in India. Other Brahmin sub-castes {{in the region are}} Karhade Brahmin, Devrukhe, Konkanastha and Goud Saraswat Brahmin, but these sub-castes only have a regional significance. Goud Saraswat Brahmins {{fall under the}} Pancha Gauda Brahmin classification, i.e. North Indian Brahmins. The Vedas are the world's oldest texts that are still used in worship and they are the oldest literature of India. Four Vedas exist of which the Rig Veda is the oldest. They were handed down from one generation of Brahmins to the next verbally and memorised by each generation. They were written down sometime around 400 BC. Other Vedas include the Yajur Veda, the Atharva Veda and the Sama Veda. Two different versions of the Yajur Veda exist, the White (Shukla in Sanskrit) and the black or (Krishna in Sanskrit). The Shukla Yajur Veda has a two different branches (Shakha in Sanskrit) called the Kanva and the Madhyandin. Deshastha Brahmins are further classified in two major sub-sects, the Deshashatha Rigvedi and the Deshastha Yajurvedi, based on the Veda <b>they</b> <b>follow.</b> <b>The</b> Yajurvedis are further classified into two groups called the Madhyandins and the Kanavas. The Madhyandins follow the Madhyandin branch of the Shukla Yajur Veda. The word Madhyandin is a fusion of two words Madhya and din which mean middle and day respectively. They are so called because they perform Sandhya Vandana at noon.|$|E

25|$|Most {{non-human}} mammals {{have a much}} keener {{sense of}} smell than humans, although the mechanism is similar. An example of smell in non-mammals is that of sharks, which combine their keen sense of smell with timing to determine {{the direction of a}} smell. <b>They</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> nostril that first detected the smell. Insects have olfactory receptors on their antennae.|$|E
25|$|The jet streams are {{systems of}} upper-air westerlies. They {{give rise to}} slowly moving upper-air waves, with 250-knot winds in some air streams. First {{observed}} by World War II pilots, they develop just below the tropopause over areas of steep pressure gradient on the surface. The main types are the polar jets, the subtropical westerly jets, and the less common tropical easterly jets. <b>They</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> principle of geostrophic winds.|$|E
25|$|The micrometre-sized {{phosphor}} particles used in thermographic PIV are seeded {{into the}} flow as a tracer and, after illumination {{with a thin}} laser light sheet, {{the temperature of the}} particles can be measured from the phosphorescence, normally using an intensity ratio technique. It is important that the particles are of small size so that not only <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> flow satisfactorily but also they rapidly assume its temperature. For a diameter of 2µm, the thermal slip between particle and gas is as small as the velocity slip.|$|E

25|$|Latimeria {{is a rare}} genus of {{fish that}} {{includes}} two extant species: West Indian Ocean coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) and the Indonesian coelacanth (Latimeria menadoensis). <b>They</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> oldest known living lineage of Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish and tetrapods), which means they are {{more closely related to}} lungfish, reptiles and mammals than to the common ray-finned fishes. They are found along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean and Indonesia. Since there are only two species of coelacanth and both are threatened, it is the most endangered genus of animals in the world. The West Indian Ocean coelacanth is a critically endangered species.|$|E
