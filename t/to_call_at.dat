5|$|After storms, the Beagle reached Montevideo on 26 July 1832, {{and took}} {{observations}} for the chronometers. An attempt <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Buenos Aires for information was thwarted by officials, then FitzRoy agreed {{a request for}} ship's crew (and Darwin) to briefly occupy a Montevideo fort to dispel a revolution. On 22 August, after taking soundings in Samborombón Bay, the Beagle began survey work down the coast from Cape San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|In March 1965, a NOTAM {{was issued}} of changes {{had been made}} into the {{arrangements}} for light aircraft crossing the Channel. These changes were partly to avoid conflict with traffic flying into Lydd (Ferryfield). Non-radio aircraft could use the route between Hythe and Ambleteuse. Non-radio aircraft were advised <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Lympne before crossing. On 11 July, one of Skyways Coach Air's Avro 748s crashed on landing at Lympne.|$|E
5|$|Nansen {{soon learned}} that no ship was likely <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Godthaab until the {{following}} spring, though {{they were able to}} send letters back to Norway via a boat leaving Ivigtut at the end of October. He and his party therefore spent the next seven months in Greenland, hunting, fishing and studying the life of the local inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|Originally, Betelgeuse was <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Sines, Portugal, {{to lighten}} the load of the ship, but poor weather {{conditions}} prevented the vessel from entering the harbour. Plans were further frustrated at Leixões, where a ship had run aground across the harbour entrance, preventing Betelgeuse from berthing there to discharge her cargo. Betelgeuse was then instructed to sail for Whiddy Island, Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Otherwise, {{their stay}} in Paris {{was filled with}} well-wishers who came <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>at</b> the hotel. Queen Victoria sent her chargé d'affaires to present him with the Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George. After days of visitors, which {{included}} world dignitaries and representatives of two different Masonic lodges, Kalākaua and friends attended a performance of Giuseppe Verdi's opera Aida. He was given {{a tour of the}} headquarters of Le Figaro, and visited the Société de géographie. On August 15, the royal group, which now included Hoffnung, left on the evening train, bound for Portugal and Spain.|$|E
5|$|The {{route through}} the station will be busier from December 2014 to 2018 as Thameslink trains serving London Bridge will be {{diverted}} via Herne Hill– an additional four trains per hour in both directions. This {{is due to}} the redevelopment of London Bridge that will temporarily close it to Bedford-Brighton trains. The additional trains will not call at Herne Hill; they will run fast between London Blackfriars and East Croydon. It would not be possible for the 12-car peak trains <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Herne Hill as the platforms are too short and it would not be viable to use selective door operation as the carriages not on the platforms would foul the junctions.|$|E

25|$|Because of a Moderation of Competition clause {{inserted}} into Virgin Trains' Track Access Contract with Network Rail by the government, Wrexham & Shropshire {{were not able}} to service a number of West Coast Main Line stations. Wrexham & Shropshire's Track Access Contract did not allow it <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Birmingham New Street or Coventry, although the contract did allow it <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Wolverhampton and Birmingham International to pick up only on northbound services and set down only on southbound services, although Wrexham & Shropshire elected not to serve the latter.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese {{found the}} island uninhabited, with an {{abundance}} of trees and fresh water. They imported livestock, fruit trees and vegetables, and built a chapel and one or two houses. They formed no permanent settlement, but the island was an important rendezvous point and source of food for ships travelling by Cape Route from Asia to Europe, and frequently sick mariners were left on the island to recover before taking passage on the next ship <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>at</b> the island.|$|E
25|$|The port is the nation's top gateway for {{international}} flights and its busiest center for overall passenger and air freight flights. There are two foreign-trade zones (FTZ) within the port. The port handled $208billion in shipping cargo in 2011, and 3,342,286 containers and 393,931 automobiles in 2014. The largest ship, the CMA CGM Theodore Roosevelt <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>at</b> an East Coast port passed under the raised Bayonne Bridge in July 2017, signalling {{a new era}} of container capacity.|$|E
25|$|After her Olympic charter ended, Finland {{returned}} to her usual New York–Antwerp route until the outbreak of war in Europe in August 1914.

25|$|Pedro Lopes de Sousa, {{a highly}} {{respected}} fidalgo from Trancoso, happened <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Colombo {{on his way to}} Goa from Malacca, in order to pick up provisions and fresh water. Francisco da Silva received him well at the fort, and casually broached his plan. Silva also expressed a desire to lead the expedition, citing his long experience of fighting in Ceylon. He further requested Souza to pursue the matter in Goa, in order to obtain additional troops and other resources for the expedition.|$|E
25|$|The {{failure to}} {{complete}} this section ended the Midland's hopes of being a serious competitor on routes to Scotland and finally put beyond all doubt that Leeds, not Bradford, would be the West Riding's principal city. Midland trains to Scotland therefore continued <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Leeds before travelling along the Aire Valley to the Settle and Carlisle. From Carlisle they then travelled onwards via either the Glasgow and South Western or Waverley Route. In days gone by the line enjoyed named expresses such as the Thames–Clyde Express and The Waverley.|$|E
25|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} roads were {{upgraded}} between Argentia {{and the newly}} opened Trans-Canada Highway at Whitbourne. In 1967 a new ferry terminal was opened by Canadian National Railway and the Ambrose Shea became the first seasonal ferry <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>at</b> the port, largely carrying tourists bound for the Avalon Peninsula (19 hours crossing time) from North Sydney, Nova Scotia. In the 1980s the terminal was upgraded by CN Marine and in 1989 the company's successor, Marine Atlantic, welcomed the MV Joseph and Clara Smallwood superferry (14 hours crossing time) on the Argentia summer run.|$|E
