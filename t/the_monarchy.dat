During her reign, she {{attempted}} to draft a new constitution which would restore the power of <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> and the voting rights of the economically disenfranchised. Threatened by her attempts to abrogate the Bayonet Constitution, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> on January 17, 1893. The overthrow was bolstered by the landing of US Marines under John L. Stevens to protect American interests, which rendered <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> unable to protect itself.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{establishing}} a republic {{instead of a}} monarchy was around 18 per cent in the United Kingdom in 2006, while a majority thinks that {{there will still be}} a monarchy in the United Kingdom in ten years' time, public opinion is rather uncertain about a monarchy still existing in fifty years and a clear majority believes that <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> will no longer exist a century after the poll. Public opinion is, however, certain that <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> will still exist in thirty years. About 30 per cent are in favour of discontinuing <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> after Elizabeth's death.|$|E

5|$|Kirill {{suffered}} {{a nervous breakdown}} in 1923 and Victoria nursed him back to health. She encouraged his dreams of restoring <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> in Russia and becoming Tsar. At Saint-Briac Kirill, aware of the murders of Tsar Nicholas II and his only son, officially declared himself the Guardian of the Throne in 1924. Victoria went {{on a trip to}} the United States in 1924, hoping to raise American support for restoration of <b>the</b> <b>monarchy.</b> Her efforts evoked little response, due to the isolationism prevalent in the United States during the 1920s. She continued in her efforts to help Kirill restore <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> and also sold her artwork {{to raise money for the}} household.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1848 {{division}} of land known as the Great Māhele, {{during the reign of}} Kamehameha III, all land in Hawaii was owned by <b>the</b> <b>monarchy.</b> The Great Māhele subdivided the land among <b>the</b> <b>monarchy,</b> the government, and acreage to allow private ownership by tenants living on the land. What was reserved for <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> became known as the Crown Lands of Hawaii. When Hawaii was annexed, the Crown Lands were seized by the United States government. The Queen gave George Macfarlane her power of attorney in 1898 as part of her legal defense team in seeking indemnity for the government's seizure of the Crown Lands. She filed a protest with the United States Senate on December 20, 1898, requesting their return and claiming the lands were seized without due process or recompense.|$|E
5|$|The precipitating event {{leading to}} the 1893 {{overthrow}} of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was the attempt by Queen Liliʻuokalani to promulgate a new constitution to regain the power for <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> and Native Hawaiians that had been lost under the Bayonet Constitution. The stated goals of her opponents, who were non-native Hawaiian Kingdom subjects (five American nationals, one English national, and one German national), were to depose the Queen, overthrow <b>the</b> <b>monarchy,</b> and seek Hawaii's annexation to the United States.|$|E

5|$|The {{roots of}} the {{collapse}} of <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> can be traced as far back as 1850, upon the death of Pedro II's youngest male child. From that point onward, the Emperor ceased to believe in <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> as a viable form of government for Brazil's future, as his remaining heir was a daughter. Although constitutionally permitted, a female ruler was considered unacceptable by both Pedro II and the ruling circles. This issue was deferred for decades, during which the country became more powerful and prosperous. So long as the Emperor enjoyed good health, the matter of succession could be ignored.|$|E

5|$|At her Silver Jubilee in 1977, {{the crowds}} and {{celebrations}} were genuinely enthusiastic, but in the 1980s, public criticism {{of the royal family}} increased, as the personal and working lives of Elizabeth's children came under media scrutiny. Elizabeth's popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public. Discontent with <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> reached its peak on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, though Elizabeth's personal popularity and support for <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.|$|E

The problems facing <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> were complex and daunting but Catherine was able to keep <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> and the state institutions functioning even at a minimum level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Protestants, or Huguenots, as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies against them. In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout France.|$|E

5|$|Dissatisfaction {{became more}} evident during the 1880s, and some {{officers}} began to display open insubordination. The Emperor {{and the politicians}} did nothing to improve the military nor meet their demands. The dissemination of Positivist ideology among young officers brought further complications, as Positivism opposed <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> under the belief that a dictatorial republic would bring improvements. A coalition between a mutinous Army faction and the Positivist camp was formed and directly led to the republican coup on 15 November 1889. Battalions and even full regiments of soldiers loyal to the Empire, who shared {{the ideals of the}} older generation of leaders, attempted to restore <b>the</b> <b>monarchy.</b> Attempts at a restoration proved futile and supporters of the Empire were executed, arrested or forcibly retired.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} last four decades of PedroII's reign were marked by {{continuous}} internal peace and economic prosperity, he had no desire to see <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> survive beyond his lifetime and made no effort to maintain support for the institution. The next in line to the throne was his daughter Isabel, but neither PedroII nor the ruling classes considered a female monarch acceptable. Lacking any viable heir, the Empire's political leaders saw no reason to defend <b>the</b> <b>monarchy.</b> After a 58-year reign, on 15 November 1889 the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by a dictator, forming the First Brazilian Republic.|$|E

Re-imprisoned on the Isle of Wight, Charles forged an alliance with Scotland, {{but by the end of}} 1648 Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army had consolidated its control over England.
