Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could acquire and dispose of considerable fortunes; for instance, the Arch of the Sergii was funded by Salvia Postuma, a female {{member of the family}} honoured, and the largest building in the forum at Pompeii was funded by Eumachia, a priestess of Venus.|$|E
5|$|The {{reductions}} were self-sufficient {{indigenous communities}} of 2,000–4,000 inhabitants, usually headed by two Jesuit priests and the cabildo (town council and cacique (tribal leader), who retained their functions {{and played the}} role of intermediaries between the native peoples and the Jesuits. However, {{the degree to which the}} Jesuits controlled the indigenous population for which they had responsibility and <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> allowed indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate, and the social organization of the reductions have been variously described as jungle utopias on the one hand, to theocratic regimes of terror, the former description being much closer to the mark.|$|E

25|$|As blood perfuses the system, it exerts shear and {{pressure}} {{forces on the}} vessel walls. At the same time, tissue growth outside the cardiovascular system pushes back {{on the outside of}} the vessel walls. These forces must be balanced to obtain an efficient energy state for low-cost delivery of nutrients and oxygen to all tissues of the embryo body. When growth of the yolk sac (external tissue) is constrained, the balance between vascular forces and tissue forces is shifted and some vascular branches may be disconnected or diminished during the remodelling process because they are unable to forge new paths through the compressed tissue. In general, the stiffness and resistance of these tissues dictates <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> can be deformed and the way in which biomechanical forces can affect them.|$|E

25|$|Because {{of their}} legal status as {{citizens}} and <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> could become emancipated, women in ancient Rome could own property, enter contracts, {{and engage in}} business. Some acquired and disposed of sizable fortunes, and are recorded in inscriptions as benefactors in funding major public works. Roman women could appear in court and argue cases, though it was customary {{for them to be}} represented by a man. They were simultaneously disparaged as too ignorant and weak-minded to practice law, and as too active and influential in legal matters—resulting in an edict that limited women to conducting cases on their own behalf instead of others'. But even after this restriction was put in place, there are numerous examples of women taking informed actions in legal matters, including dictating legal strategy to their male advocates.|$|E
25|$|As {{effective}} caregiving {{involves a}} great amount of responsibility, as well as the expenditure of cognitive, emotional, and/or tangible resources, caregivers must be sufficiently motivated in order to provide responsive support to their relationship partner. That is, people who do not possess enough motivation to help will be less effective at providing care that is appropriate for their partner's needs. Furthermore, individuals may differ in <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> hold altruistic versus egoistic motivations for helping. Altruistic motivations are centred on the desire to advance the significant other's welfare, whereas egoistic motivations are centred on the desire to gain benefits for oneself, or to avoid sanctions for not helping and/or other negative consequences to the self. More altruistic and less egoistic motivations for caregiving are linked to better outcomes for the care recipient and enhanced relationship quality.|$|E
25|$|Mining {{operations}} use crushers, commonly {{classified by}} <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> fragment the starting material, with {{primary and secondary}} crushers handling coarse materials, and tertiary and quaternary crushers reducing ore particles to finer gradations. Each crusher is designed {{to work with a}} certain maximum size of raw material, and often delivers its output to a screening machine which sorts and directs the product for further processing. Typically, crushing stages are followed by milling stages if the materials need to be further reduced. Additionally rockbreakers are typically located next to a crusher to reduce oversize material too large for a crusher. Crushers are used to reduce particle size enough so that the material can be processed into finer particles in a grinder. A typical processing line at a mine might consist of a crusher followed by a SAG mill followed by a ball mill. In this context, the SAG mill and ball mill are considered grinders rather than crushers.|$|E

25|$|Reductions {{were laid}} out {{according}} to a standardised plan: the main buildings, like the church, college and churchyard were concentrated around a wide square, with houses facing the other three sides. Each village also provided a house for widows, a hospital, and several warehouses. In {{the centre of the}} square there was a cross and a statue of the mission's patron saint. The reductions were ruled by indigenous chiefs who served as the reductions' governors, but were controlled by the Jesuits. There was a minimum of two Jesuits in a reduction, with more for larger ones. The social organization of the reductions has often been described as extremely efficient; most were self-supporting and even produced surpluses of goods, which they traded to outside communities, which laid the foundation of the belief that Jesuits were guarding immense riches acquired through Indian labour. The main traded produce was the hides of their cattle and yerba mate, leaves drunk somewhat like tea. Initially these were collected from the wild, but later cultivated. A number of trades and skills were taught to some Indians, including even printing to produce mostly religious texts in indigenous languages, some illustrated by engravings by indigenous artists. In reality the communities were economically successful but hardly constituted any important source of income for the Jesuit order. The degree to which the Jesuits controlled the indigenous population for which they had responsibility and <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> allowed indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate.|$|E

500|$|Many of Monteverdi's lost works {{date from}} the 1610s and 1620s, and the manuscripts may have {{disappeared}} in the wars that overcame Mantua in 1630.

In an essay on the opera orchestras of Montverdi's day, Janet Beat regrets that the 30-year gap between L'Orfeo and the next Monteverdi opera to have survived, Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria, hampers the study of how opera orchestration developed during those critical years.|$|E
