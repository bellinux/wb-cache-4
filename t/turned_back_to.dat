5|$|Bus. M-28 was {{originally}} {{a section of}} M-28 before the latter was realigned in the late 1930s. The highway carried the M-28A designation before it was redesignated as Bus. M-28 in 1950. The trunkline was partially <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> local control in 1953, and the business loop designation was removed at that time.

5|$|M-221 {{was part}} of the {{original}} M-25 that ran through the eastern UP in 1919. This specific segment of roadway ran north into Brimley and turned east onto 6 Mile Road to connect with US Highway 2 (now H-63/Mackinac Trail) The trunkline became part of M-28. In early 1942, M-28 was rerouted on the current alignment south of Brimley and this highway was <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> local control. In 1945, M-221 was designated along a portion of the former M-28.|$|E
5|$|M-87 {{was assumed}} {{into the state}} {{trunkline}} system by July 1, 1919, when the system was first signed. At the time, the highway connected M-65 in Fenton with M-10 east of Holly. Later when the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, those two highways were renumbered US23 and US10 respectively. The highway was fully paved in 1937. In 1958, Fenton was bypassed by the Fenton–Clio Expressway {{to the west of}} downtown. and the former route through downtown was redesignated Bus. US23.

5|$|On July 1, 1919, M-74 ran between Pioneer and M-55 west of Merritt. There {{it turned}} east running {{concurrently}} with M-55 to Merritt where it turned south to Moddersville and terminated. The spur south of Merrit remained a state highway {{through at least}} late 1938. Late that year or early the next, the roadway between Merritt and Moddersville was <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> local control and removed from the highway system. By late 1939, the entire highway was decommissioned in its entirety. The highway designation has not been used since.|$|E
5|$|The Bus. M-28 {{designation}} {{remained in}} place until late 1952 on maps. The April15, 1953 MSHD map shows the highway <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> local control. The concurrent M-117/Bus. M-28 segment was redesignated as just M-117. Later in 1953, M-117 was shown rerouted due south of Newberry, avoiding the jog along Webber and Miller roads. The segment of M-117 north of Newberry, including part of the former Bus. M-28 became part of an extended M-123 by {{the publication of the}} 1962 MSHD map.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{designation}} {{was extended}} {{south to the}} then-new US16 freeway (now Interstate 96) around 1958. It was later truncated back to M-21 in Lowell in 1968. By 1980, the section of M-91 in Ionia County south of M-44 to the Kent County line was <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> local control. The highway section in Kent County remained marked as M-91, resulting in a discontinuous highway. The southern section between Lowell and the county line was turned back by 1985, resulting in the modern routing of M-91.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} version of M-179 {{was established in}} 1935 as a shortcut near Le Roy between US131 and what was M-63.

(The original M-63 itself was decommissioned {{a few years later}} in 1961.) On October 1, 1998, as part of the Rationalization process, a jurisdictional transfer turned county road A-42 between US131 and M-43 over to the state, which the state later designated as M-179 for the following year.|$|E
5|$|The route {{continued}} past Redbird {{into the}} town of Stockton, where it left Cassadaga Creek and headed uphill as it curved to the west. In Centralia, NY380 met CR54 and CR57 at a four-way intersection. Here, NY380 <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the north and descended into another valley surrounding the Bear Lake Outlet. The route crossed the outlet and followed the waterway into the hamlet of Stockton, centered on the intersection between NY380 and NY424 (now part of CR58).|$|E
5|$|Additional realignments were {{completed}} by the MSHD to move US2 to its modern lakeshore routing between Gould City and Epoufette in 1941. The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to Naubinway and then along the lake to Epoufette. The former route through Engadine was <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> local control as far east as Garnet. From there east, it was numbered just M‑48, removing US2 from a concurrency. Another former section into Epoufette was added to extend M‑117. The new highway was detoured around the Cut River Bridge until it was completed in 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages during World War II.|$|E
