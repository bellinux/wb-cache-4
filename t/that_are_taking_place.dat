5|$|The {{gymnasium}} has {{a capacity}} of approximately 16,000 and the smaller building can accommodate up 5,300 depending on the events <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place.</b> At {{the time it was}} built, the gymnasium had the world's largest suspended roof span. Two reinforced concrete pillars support a pre-stressed steel net onto which steel plates are attached. The bottom anchoring of this steel net is a heavy concrete support system which forms a distinct curve on the interior and exterior of the building. In the interior, this structural anchor is used to support the grandstand seats. The overall curvature of the roof helps protect the building from the damaging effects of strong winds.|$|E

The five of them rescue Jake, but Skip succeeds in using the enlarging machine, growing to 30 feet tall, and calls the Zirkonian invasion ships. They defeat him and shrink him again. Tazer and Razor flee, while Skip is shrunk to a tiny size by the machine. Sparks calls off the invasion and returns home. The rest of the vacation goes back to normal, except the kids grew closer to each other during their adventure. In the distance, Skip appears, bent on revenge, but meets his demise when a crow flies over and grabs him.|$|E

Johnson VA Medical Center in Charleston, South Carolina indicate that rooms where common touch surfaces were replaced with copper demonstrated a 97% reduction in surface pathogens versus the non-coppered rooms and that patients in the coppered ICU rooms had a 40.4% lower risk of contracting a hospital acquired infection versus patients in non-coppered ICU rooms.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{statement}} before the U.S. House of Representatives, Dr. Damon Noto said “the prisoners {{sentenced to death}} cannot fully account for all the transplantations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> in China [...] Even if they executed 10,000 and transplanted 10,000 a year, {{there would still be}} a very large discrepancy. Why is that? It is simply impossible that those 10,000 people executed would match perfectly the 10,000 people that needed the organs.” David Kilgour and David Matas similarly write that traditional sources of transplants such as executed prisoners, donors, and the brain dead [...] "come nowhere near to explaining the total number of transplants across China." [...] Like Noto, they point to the large number of Falun Gong practitioners in the labor camp and prison system as a likely alternative source for organs.|$|E
2500|$|Inspired {{in part by}} {{an earlier}} musical {{version of the same}} story by Ken Hill, Lloyd Webber's score is {{sometimes}} operatic in style but maintains the form and structure of a musical throughout. The full-fledged operatic passages are reserved principally for subsidiary characters such as Andre and Firmin, Carlotta, and Piangi. They are also used to provide the content of the fictional [...] "operas" [...] <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> within the show itself, viz., Hannibal, Il Muto, and the Phantom's masterwork, Don Juan Triumphant. [...] "Here, Lloyd Webber pastiched various styles from the grand operas of Meyerbeer through to Mozart and even Gilbert and Sullivan." [...] These pieces are often presented as musical fragments, interrupted by dialogue or action sequences in order to clearly define the musical's [...] "show within a show" [...] format. The musical extracts from the Phantom's opera, [...] "Don Juan Triumphant", during the latter stages of the show, are dissonant and modern—"suggesting, perhaps, that the Phantom is ahead of his time artistically".|$|E
2500|$|After McQueary was {{identified}} as the graduate assistant who reported the 2002 incident, he was criticized for not intervening to protect the boy from Sandusky (an accusation McQueary has since disputed), {{as well as for}} not reporting the incident to police himself. On November 7, Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said that though some may have fulfilled their legal obligation to report suspected abuse, [...] "somebody has to question about what I would consider the moral requirements for a human being that knows of sexual things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> with a child." [...] Noonan added that anyone who knows about suspected abuse, [...] "whether you're a football coach or a university president or the guy sweeping the building," [...] has [...] "a moral responsibility to call us." [...] Paterno said McQueary informed him that [...] "he had witnessed an incident in the shower ... but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained in the Grand Jury report." [...] Paterno was uncertain if being more graphic would have made a difference. [...] "And to be frank with you I don't know that it would have done any good, because I never heard of, of, rape and a man," [...] said Paterno.|$|E
