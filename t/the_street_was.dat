5|$|Since Koht {{lived in}} Lysaker, Bærum Municipality wanted to honor him by naming a street after him. When <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> named in 1967, Koht was still controversial. <b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> {{therefore}} named Professor Kohts vei ("Professor Koht's Road") to emphasise his academic, {{rather than his}} political career.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> not {{particularly}} significant until 1820, when Decimus Burton constructed Hyde Park Corner at the lane's southern edge, coinciding with Benjamin Dean Wyatt's reconstruction of Londonderry House and Apsley House.|$|E

5|$|Tanning {{and other}} {{industries}} declined sharply after the River Fleet was routed underground in 1766. <b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> widened during the late-19th century, when Temple Bar was demolished and Ludgate Circus was constructed. The {{headquarters of the}} Anti-Corn Law League were based at No.67 Fleet Street, and a blue plaque marks the location.|$|E
5|$|The road's {{name comes}} from the Old English strond, meaning {{the edge of a}} river, as it {{historically}} ran alongside the north bank of the River Thames. <b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> popular with the British upper classes between the 12th and 17th centuries, with many historically important mansions being built between the Strand and the river. These included Essex House, Arundel House, Somerset House, Savoy Palace, Durham House and Cecil House. The aristocracy moved to the West End over the 17th century, following which the Strand became well known for coffee shops, restaurants and taverns. <b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> a centre point for theatre and music hall during the 19th century, and several venues remain on the Strand. At the east end of the street are two historic churches: St Mary le Strand and St Clement Danes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by John Nash, {{who had been}} appointed to the Office of Woods and Forests in 1806 and previously served {{as an adviser to}} the Prince Regent. He put forward his own plans for the street in 1810 following the death of Fordyce, envisioning broad, architecturally distinguished thoroughfares and public spaces.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>is</b> {{named for}} Holy Cross Church, which stands on Krakowskie Przedmieście. Named after <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>are</b> a Warsaw Metro {{station and the}} Świętokrzyski Bridge.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> named Bow Street in 1638 {{after its}} basic shape. It {{was always the}} Earl's {{intention}} to extend {{it as far as}} Long Acre, but this was delayed. It was eventually connected by his son, William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford, who gave ownership of the street over to the Paving Commissioners of St. Martin in the Fields, so it could be a public right of way.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> one of {{the first}} in London to be lit by gas after Frederick Albert Winsor set up {{experimental}} lighting on 4 June 1807 to celebrate King George III's birthday. Permanent lighting was installed in 1820. The eastern end of Pall Mall was widened between 1814 and 1818; a row of houses on its north side was demolished {{to make way for the}} Royal Opera Arcade.|$|E
5|$|When the IRT subway {{debuted in}} 1904, the typical tunnel {{construction}} method was cut-and-cover. <b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> torn up to dig the tunnel below before being rebuilt from above. Traffic {{on the street}} above would be interrupted due to the digging up of the street. Temporary steel and wooden bridges carried surface traffic above the construction.|$|E
50|$|Across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Palazzo Ridolfi (Via di Maggio #13), {{designed}} by Santi di Tito. On {{the same side}} of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>is</b> Palazzo Machiavelli (#16-18), now an Anglican church.|$|R

5000|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>is</b> one of Limerick's main {{thoroughfares}} {{and shopping}} <b>streets</b> <b>the</b> quality of retail on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>is</b> not particularly high with exception to some retail stores near <b>the</b> O'Connell <b>Street</b> junction. <b>The</b> <b>street</b> tends to <b>be</b> dominated by Euro Stores, discount and charity shops particularly as one goes further up <b>the</b> <b>street.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although Nash was {{responsible}} for the street's general development, some individual buildings were designed by Charles Robert Cockerell and Sir John Soane, amongst others. By 1819, the Crown were receiving regular rent and <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> becoming established. At first, it was called New Street and became a dividing line between Soho, which had declined socially and economically, and the fashionable squares and streets of Mayfair to the west. Carlton House did not last long following completion of the works and was demolished in 1829, to be replaced by Carlton House Terrace, also designed by Nash.|$|E
5|$|Currently, Caroline never reaches {{water at}} either ends. The 1829 map, however, shows it {{accessing}} the Gulf of Mexico at both termini. Whereas the road now starts at Whitehead, it once continued past both Whitehead and Front to the shore. This {{is confirmed by}} {{a map of the}} island from the early 1900s, which depicts Caroline abutting a breakwater at its southwestern end. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> excluded from the lot of the Truman Annex, and disconnected from the water at its northeastern terminus by the construction of the former City Electric Power Plant on new land.|$|E

5|$|In 1608–09, Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton built a {{house on}} {{the eastern side of the}} former Chapel and Hospital of St. Mary Rounceval, at Charing Cross, {{including}} gardens running to the River Thames and adjoining Scotland Yard to the west. The estate became the property of Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland when he married Howard's great-great niece, Lady Elizabeth, in 1642, whereupon it was known as Northumberland House. In turn, <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> named Northumberland Street. The house was damaged in the Wilkes' election riots of 1768, but was saved after its owner, Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland opened the nearby Ship Ale House, driving off rioters.|$|E
5|$|In 1711, by {{the order}} of then-Governor of Kiev, the route between the Zamkova and Andriyivskyy {{mountains}} were expanded, thus allowing traffic to become more suitable for horses and wagon carriages. The Andriyivskyy Descent was renamed in 1920 in honor of young revolutionary Georgiy Liver. In 1944, {{it was decided to}} return the street to its prior name; in 1957, <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> renamed back to Andreevsky Spusk—the Russian variant of Andriyivskyy Descent. In the 1980s, the Andriyivskyy Descent received a thorough reconstruction after years of disrepair.|$|E
5|$|In June 1874, {{the whole}} of Northumberland House was {{purchased}} by the Metropolitan Board of Works and demolished to form Northumberland Avenue, which would accommodate hotels. Contemporary planning permissions forbade hotels to be taller than {{the width of the}} road they were on; consequently Northumberland Avenue was built with a wide carriageway. Part of the parallel Northumberland Street was demolished in order {{to make way for the}} avenue's eastern end. <b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> open by 1876. The hotels were popular for American visitors as they were near to the West End, government buildings on Whitehall and all the mainline stations.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> mainly {{inhabited}} by merchants and craftspeople. Although they {{are long gone}} due to the sweeping demographic changes in Kiev during times of the late Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, the street is once again thriving thanks to its unique topology, architecture, rich history and also many gift shops and small art galleries showcasing various paintings and sculptures by Ukrainian artists. The descent {{is one of the}} favorite spots for tourists. It is also notable for the many festivals it holds, including various art festivals and the Kiev Day celebrations on the last weekend of May.|$|E
5|$|It {{is first}} {{recorded}} in local records as Osborne Street in 1877, and given its present name in 1882. According to education historian Alison Wheatley, {{the street is}} possibly named after a James Turner who taught at King Edward's School in Birmingham, and the name may have been suggested by a former pupil, who became a town planner, {{as a way of}} honouring Turner's legacy. However, the Birmingham historian Carl Chinn believes <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> named for a local businessman and partner in the firm Hammond, Turner & Sons, a manufacturer of buttons.|$|E
