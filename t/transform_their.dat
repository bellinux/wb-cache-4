5|$|At {{the time}} of Indian {{independence}} in 1947, India was divided into two sets of territories, one under direct British rule, and the other under the suzerainty of the British Crown, with control over their internal affairs remaining {{in the hands of}} their hereditary rulers. In addition, there were several colonial enclaves controlled by France and Portugal. The political integration of these territories into India was a declared objective of the Indian National Congress, and the Government of India pursued this over the next decade. Through a combination of factors, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and V. P. Menon convinced the rulers of the various princely states to accede to India. Having secured their accession, they then proceeded, in a step-by-step process, to secure and extend the central government's authority over these states and <b>transform</b> <b>their</b> administrations until, by 1956, there was little difference between the territories that had been part of British India and those that had been part of princely states. Simultaneously, the Government of India, through a combination of diplomatic and military means, acquired de facto and de jure control over the remaining colonial enclaves, which too were integrated into India.|$|E
5|$|The Second Congress of the Communist International {{opened in}} Petrograd's Smolny Institute in July 1920, {{representing}} {{the last time}} that Lenin visited a city other than Moscow. There, he encouraged foreign delegates to emulate the Bolsheviks' seizure of power, and abandoned his longstanding viewpoint that capitalism was a necessary stage in societal development, instead encouraging those nations under colonial occupation to <b>transform</b> <b>their</b> pre-capitalist societies directly into socialist ones. For this conference, he authored , a short book articulating his criticism of elements within the British and German communist parties who refused to enter their nations' parliamentary systems and trade unions; instead he urged them to do so to advance the revolutionary cause. The conference had to be suspended for several days due to the ongoing war with Poland, and was relocated to Moscow, where it continued to hold sessions until August. Lenin's predicted world revolution did not materialise, as the Hungarian communist government was overthrown and the German Marxist uprisings suppressed.|$|E

25|$|The inspirations {{that led}} Csaky to Cubism were diverse, {{as they were}} for artists of the Bateau-Lavoir, on the one hand, or the Puteaux Group on the other. While art historians are divided on the {{influence}} of African art in the distillation of Cubism, they generally agree that Cézanne's geometric syntax was significant, as well as Seurat's approach to painting. Given a growing dissatisfaction with the classical methods of representation, and the contemporary changes—the industrial revolution, exposure to art from across the world—artists began to <b>transform</b> <b>their</b> expression.|$|E

25|$|The inspirations {{that led}} Csaky to Cubism were diverse, {{as they were}} for artists of Le Bateau-Lavoir, and other still of the Section d'Or.

Given a growing dissatisfaction with the classical methods of representation, and the contemporary changes—the industrial revolution, exposure to art from across the world—artists began to <b>transform</b> <b>their</b> expression. Now at 9 rue Blainville in the fifth arrondissement in Paris Csaky—along with the Cubist sculptors who would follow—stimulated by the profound cultural changes and his own experiences, contributed his own personal artistic language to the movement.|$|E
25|$|Youth {{empowerment}} is {{a process}} where {{children and young people}} are encouraged to take charge of their lives. They do this by addressing their situation and then take action in order to improve their access to resources and <b>transform</b> <b>their</b> consciousness through their beliefs, values, and attitudes. Youth empowerment aims to improve quality of life. Youth empowerment is achieved through participation in youth empowerment programs. However scholars argue that children’s rights implementation should go beyond learning about formal rights and procedures to give birth to a concrete experience of rights. There are numerous models that youth empowerment programs use that help youth achieve empowerment. A variety of youth empowerment initiatives are underway around the world. These programs can be through non-profit organizations, government organizations, schools or private organizations.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt {{tried to}} keep his {{campaign}} promise by cutting the federal budget— including a reduction in military spending from $752million in 1932 to $531million in 1934 and a 40% cut in spending on veterans' benefits— by removing 500,000 veterans and widows from the pension rolls and reducing benefits for the remainder, as well as cutting the salaries of federal employees and reducing spending on research and education. But the veterans were well organized and strongly protested, and most benefits were restored or increased by 1934. Veterans {{groups such as the}} American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars won their campaign to <b>transform</b> <b>their</b> benefits from payments due in 1945 to immediate cash when Congress overrode the President's veto and passed the Bonus Act in January 1936. It pumped sums equal to 2% of the GDP into the consumer economy and had a major stimulus effect.|$|E

25|$|In {{the direct}} sequel Mortal Kombat II, Bi-Han's place is taken {{by his brother}} Kuai Liang, whose was {{originally}} known by his codename Tundra prior to assuming his elder brother's codename to honor him. Upon his brother's death in the first tournament and the survival of Shang Tsung, Kuai Liang is sent by the Lin Kuei to complete his brother's unfinished task. In doing so, Scorpion eventually discovers that Liang is not the Sub-Zero he previously held accountable. In return for taking Bi Han's life, Scorpion vows to forever protect Liang, which becomes a deciding factor in the sequel. In Mortal Kombat 3, the younger Sub-Zero escapes from the Lin Kuei who wanted to <b>transform</b> <b>their</b> warriors into cyborgs. They program three cyborg assassins to hunt and terminate Sub-Zero (one of which being his old friend, Smoke, who failed to escape), who by this time had received a vision from Raiden and agreed to join the rebellion against a new threat.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with several}} {{returning}} items from previous games, {{such as the}} Super Leaf, Mega Mushroom, Propeller Box and Boomerang Flower, several items are introduced. The Super Bell gives players a Cat Suit, allowing them to run faster, perform unique attacks and climb up walls to reach new areas. A variation of the Super Bell, the Lucky Bell, allows the player to temporarily <b>transform</b> <b>their</b> character into a lucky cat statue that awards coins under certain conditions. Another new power-up are the Double Cherries, which make a clone of the player, allowing for more effective attacks and a higher chance of survival; the more Double Cherries the player uses, the more clones that appear. Players can also wear Cannon Boxes, which fire shots at enemies, Light Blocks, which can defeat ghosts and Goomba masks, which let them blend in with enemy Goombas. Players are also {{able to pick up}} various objects, such as bombs, baseballs and Piranha Plants, which can be used to defeat enemies or solve puzzles, and ride around in a Skating Shoe or on an aquatic dinosaur named Plessie.|$|E

500|$|In 2014, Ingels {{released}} a video entitled [...] {{as part of}} the Future of StoryTelling summit, which introduced his concept of creating architecture that focuses on turning [...] "surreal dreams into inhabitable space". Citing the power of alternate reality programs and video games, like Minecraft, Ingels' 'worldcraft' is an extension of 'hedonistic sustainability' and further develops ideas established in his first book, Yes Is More. In the video (and essay by the same name in his second book, Hot to Cold: An Odyssey of Architectural Adaptation) Ingels notes: [...] "These fictional worlds empower people with the tools to <b>transform</b> <b>their</b> own environments. This is what architecture ought to be..." [...] "Architecture must become Worldcraft, the craft of making our world, where our knowledge and technology doesn't limit us but rather enables us to turn surreal dreams into inhabitable space.

500|$|Cleave's {{interview}} with Lennon {{was published in}} the Evening Standard in March 1966 and provoked no public reaction in the UK. Church attendance there was in decline and the Christian churches were making no secret of the need to <b>transform</b> <b>their</b> image into something more relevant to modern times. Music historian Jonathan Gould wrote, [...] "The satire comedians had had a field day with the increasingly desperate attempts of the Church to make itself seem more relevant ('Don't call me vicar, call me Dick...')." [...] In 1963, the Anglican Bishop of Woolwich, John A.T. Robinson, published a controversial but popular book, Honest to God, urging the nation to reject traditional church teachings on morality and the concept of God as an [...] "old man in the sky", and instead embrace a universal ethic of love. Bryan R. Wilson's 1966 text Religion in Secular Society explained that increasing secularisation led to British churches being abandoned. However, in the US, churches remained popular.|$|E
