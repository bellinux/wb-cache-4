5|$|Another way of {{estimating}} {{the age of}} <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> is {{by looking at the}} lowest-mass objects. In normal main-sequence stars, lithium is rapidly destroyed in nuclear fusion reactions. Brown dwarfs can retain their lithium, however.

5|$|Astronomers {{characterize}} the morphology of a globular cluster {{by means of}} standard radii. These are the core radius (r'c), the half-light radius (r'h), and the tidal (or Jacobi) radius (r't). The overall luminosity of <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> steadily decreases with distance from the core, and the core radius is the distance at which the apparent surface luminosity has dropped by half. A comparable quantity is the half-light radius, or {{the distance from the}} core within which half the total luminosity from <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> is received. This is typically larger than the core radius.|$|E

5|$|Core-collapse {{is thought}} to occur when the more massive stars in a {{globular}} cluster encounter their less massive companions. Over time, dynamic processes cause individual stars to migrate {{from the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> to the outside. This results in a net loss of kinetic energy from the core region, leading the remaining stars grouped in the core region to occupy a more compact volume. When this gravothermal instability occurs, the central region of <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> becomes densely crowded with stars and the surface brightness of <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> forms a power-law cusp. (Note that a core collapse is not the only mechanism that can cause such a luminosity distribution; a massive black hole at the core can also result in a luminosity cusp.)

5|$|Globular {{clusters}} have a {{very high}} star density, and therefore close interactions and near-collisions of stars occur relatively often.

5|$|Note {{that the}} half-light radius {{includes}} {{stars in the}} outer part of <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> that happen to lie {{along the line of}} sight, so theorists will also use the half-mass radius (r'm)—the radius from the core that contains half the total mass of <b>the</b> <b>cluster.</b> When the half-mass radius of a cluster is small relative to the overall size, it has a dense core.
