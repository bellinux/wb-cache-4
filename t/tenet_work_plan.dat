40|$|Summary The {{subject of}} this study is the use of <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> (schemes of <b>work)</b> in school. A <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> is a {{document}} that describes assignment the students are expected to do during a particular period of time. It can be used to solve didactical challenges connected to pedagogic differentiation and self- regulated learning. The use of <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> is not developed as a consequence of departmental directives, but a tool made on a local level. Recent classroom research (Klette et al 2008, Haug 2009) shows {{that one of the most}} visible trends is that the amount of individual work is increasing at the expense of the collective teaching, and the use of <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> is a part of this picture. The use of <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> has been criticized because it leads to the ‘classroom’ as a learning arena becoming less important and the teacher adopting a background role. As a result, the student must take more responsibility for their own learning, and this leads to different outcomes for the students (Klette 2007). This study has three main areas of discussion: How widespread is the use <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> in school? Which activities and types of interaction have teacher and student when the <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> are used as a learning tool? What are the teacher’s intentions in their use of <b>work</b> <b>plans?</b> Data in this study are collected from a survey to teachers and quantitative classroom observations at levels 3, 6, and 9, which are based upon the research project, Quality in Education (KIO) at Volda University Collage. Collection of data took place in 2007 - 2008. The main findings in this present research are that <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> are used at all levels at Primary School level, but the KIO data identifies variations with regards to the design and application of these <b>planning</b> documents. Most <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> in use are common <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> for several subjects. These plans are used to a limited extent in schools at levels 3 through to 6, but increasing by year 9. By year 9 the students follow the <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> for a third of the time of their individual work. Teachers both justify and define the schemes of work principally as a means of informing students and parents about school work and homework in an agreed period of time. It may appear that the teachers have no holistic teaching methodology behind the use of <b>work</b> <b>plans.</b> The teacher’s main educational reasons for using <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> are pedagogic differentiation. At level 9 <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> are used as the main tool when the student is working with differential tasks, whilst year 6 students rarely work with differential tasks when they are using a <b>work</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|R

M. 1 of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Hazardous Waste Permit, NM 4890139088 -TSDF (the Permit); (NMED, 1999 a). This <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> describes the programmatic facility-wide approach to future investigations at Solid Waste Management Units (SWMUs) and Areas of Concern (AOCs) specified in the Permit. This FWP addresses the current Permit requirements. It uses the results of previous investigations performed at WIPP and expands the investigations {{as required by the}} Permit. As an alternative to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Facility Investigation (RFI) specified in Module VII of the Permit, current New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) guidance identifies an Accelerated Corrective Action Approach (ACAA) that may be used for any SWMU or AOC (NMED, 1998). This accelerated approach is used to replace the standard RFI <b>Work</b> <b>Plan</b> and Report sequence with a more flexible decision-making approach. The ACAA process allows a Facility to exit the schedule of compliance contained in the Facility’s Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) permit module and proceed on an accelerated time frame. Thus, the ACAA process can be entered either before or after an RFI <b>Work</b> <b>Plan.</b> According to NMED’s guidance, a facility can prepare an RFI <b>Work</b> <b>Plan</b> or Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP) for any SWMU or AOC (NMED, 1998). Based on this guidance, a SAP constitutes an acceptable alternative to the RFI <b>Work</b> <b>Plan</b> specified in the Permit. The scope of work for the RFI <b>Work</b> <b>Plan</b> or SAP is being developed by the Permittees. The final content of the RFI <b>Work</b> <b>Plan</b> or SAP will be coordinated with the NMED for submittal on May 24, 2000. Specific project-related planning information will be included in the RFI <b>Work</b> <b>Plan</b> or SAP. The SWMU program at WIPP began in 1994 under U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory authority. NMED subsequently received regulatory authority from EPA. A Phase I RFI was completed at WIPP as part of a Voluntary Release Assessment (VRA). The risk-based decision criteria recommended by EPA for the VRA were contained in a proposed Corrective Action rule for SWMUs (EPA, 1990).
