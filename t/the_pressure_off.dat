5|$|For the Japanese, {{the supply}} {{situation}} around Sattelberg was worsening. Although some supplies were successfully air dropped, the defenders {{were reduced to}} consuming {{only a third of}} the standard daily ration and Katagiri's supply of artillery shells was very low, despite adherence to strict fire discipline. Given the desperate supply situation, which was made all the worse when the 24th Brigade cut the track between Gusika and Wareo, the Japanese 18th Army commander, Adachi, gave Katagiri approval to withdraw from Sattelberg after 20 November. Katagiri subsequently ordered Colonel Sadahiko Miyake, the commander of the 80th Infantry Regiment, to inflict as many casualties upon the Australians as possible and then begin a progressive withdrawal to Wareo. Nevertheless, Katagiri was determined to launch a counterattack further to the north-east. When formulating his defence plans in October, he had originally intended to launch an attack from Nongora with the 79th Infantry Regiment on 25 November, however, with the Australians advancing steadily towards the main position at Sattelberg, Katagiri decided to bring this forward in order to take some of <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>off</b> the troops defending the mission. After moving into position on 21 November, the attack was launched the following day.|$|E

The French chasseurs and cuirassiers rode roughshod over the troops of Thierry and Mesko, cutting down the fugitives. Over 3,000 Austrians became prisoners, including Thierry, and four cannon were lost.|$|E
25|$|It {{was widely}} {{reported}} that since his December 1862 marriage, Morgan had {{lost some of}} his bravado.

Morgan gathered his men to an area between Liberty and Alexandria, Tennessee. On June 10, he addressed his unit, telling them that Bragg had sanctioned a raid to Louisville, and if conditions permitted, across the Ohio River into Indiana and possibly Ohio. He confided Bragg's true orders– to halt at the Ohio River– only to trusted confidant Basil Duke.|$|E
25|$|Haig met Clemenceau at Dury on 1 April. Clemenceau summoned Foch on the telephone, {{and after}} his arrival he ordered the French line {{extended}} northwards to the River Luce, south of the Somme. Haig agreed with Clemenceau’s suggestion that Foch should be given more power over Petain. The Germans were known to still have {{a large number of}} divisions in reserve (diary 2 April). Lloyd George, Clemenceau, Foch, Petain, Haig and Pershing (the US Commander-in-Chief, who had not been at Doullens) met at Beauvais (3 April), where Foch was given “strategical direction of military operations” although his powers were still largely based on persuasion rather than command.

25|$|In November 1943, Stalin {{met with}} Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran, a {{location}} of Stalin's choosing. There, Stalin and Roosevelt got on well, with both desiring the post-war {{dismantling of the}} British Empire. At Tehran, the trio agreed that to prevent Germany rising to military prowess yet again, the German state should be broken up. Roosevelt and Churchill also agreed to Stalin's demand that the German city of Konigsberg be declared Soviet territory. Stalin was impatient for the UK and US {{to open up a}} Western Front to take <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>off</b> of the East; they eventually did so in the summer of 1944. Stalin insisted that, after the war, the Soviet Union should incorporate the portions of Poland it occupied pursuant to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Germany, which Churchill opposed. Discussing the fate of the Balkans, later in 1944 Churchill agreed to Stalin's suggestion that after the war, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Yugoslavia would come under the Soviet sphere of influence while Greece would come under that of the West.|$|E
25|$|Four Ottoman {{divisions}} {{fought in}} the area: the 19th, 24th and 27th Divisions, and the 3rd Cavalry Division. During the battle on 31 October, the Ottoman III Corps headquarters had retreated from Beersheba to Tel es Sheria but, the next day (1 November), moved to support the defence of the Jerusalem road from Edh Dhahriye. They were followed by the 143rd Regiment (24th Division) and 1,500 rifles of the Beersheba Group, which had been reorganised at Tel es Sheria. This latter group moved to defend Tel el Khuweilfe. On 1 November, the 125th Regiment (16th Division) also moved west into the hills coming {{under the command of}} the 27th Division, while the 6th Cavalry Regiment covered the Ottoman left flank to Yutta. Kress von Kressenstein also sent the 19th Division to reinforce the Seventh Army in the area. This strong Ottoman presence defending the area was designed to encourage Allenby to commit more units to the attack, to take <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>off</b> the Ottoman forces defending Gaza and Sharia, and to lessen the possibility of an EEF breakthrough.|$|E

500|$|Although they {{initially}} {{worked well}} together, Simon and Groening's relationship became [...] "very contentious" [...] according to Groening. Simon never expected {{the show to}} be a success, often proclaiming to fellow staff members [...] "We're thirteen and out"—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season. Therefore, he also told the staff that they had creative freedom {{to do whatever they}} wanted to make The Simpsons as good a show as possible, regardless of network or public opinion, because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed; he elaborated in 2009 that [...] "really I was saying that to take <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>off</b> of everyone. I was just saying let's just go out and make 13 episodes that are really good and really funny." [...] However, Groening interpreted it as meaning Simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not, as Simon's career would survive, whereas his own would not. In 2001, Groening described Simon as [...] "brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers I've ever worked with, although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced." [...] According to John Ortved's book , when the show became successful Simon resented the media attention Groening received, particularly the praise for the show's writing; Simon felt that Groening's involvement was limited, and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show. Simon later spoke well of Groening's influence, particularly on the show's positive tone.|$|E

Miller, who entered the game with 17:38 left, scored 17 {{points in the second}} half as the Wildcats turned a 4439 halftime deficit into a 9583 win. Miller credited Pitino's decision to bring him off the bench in the second half with taking <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>off</b> him and helping him get more comfortable in the game.

This obtained d CRYST was somewhat {{located in the}} middle of range of homo-brush single crystal thickness (d PEG) and that of PEG 5000 one (3.67 – 10.33  nm). With increase of the amorphous block molecular weight, the portion of homo-PEG chains in the crystal structure has been raised, and it could be attributed to higher tendency of system to attract the homopolymers to lift <b>the</b> respective osmotic <b>pressure</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> substrate surface. Via increasing the amorphous block molecular weight, the critical quorum demanded to lift <b>the</b> osmotic <b>pressure</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> substrate, and to heighten its thickness increased. The effective parameters on the hindrance of single crystal systems fell into the solvent quality, the amorphous block molecular weight, and the interaction between the tethered amorphous chains and substrate surface.

The mentioned trend was satisfied at elevated crystallization temperature as well.|$|R
