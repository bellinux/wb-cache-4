5|$|Compression of {{ambient air}} causes a {{temperature}} {{rise of the}} gas, proportional to the pressure increase. Ambient air is typically compressed in stages, and the gas temperature rises during each stage. Intercoolers and water cooling heat exchangers can remove <b>this</b> <b>heat</b> between stages.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons that}} remain obscure, the planet's {{thermosphere}} {{is at an}} anomalously high temperature of about 750K. The planet is {{too far from the}} Sun for <b>this</b> <b>heat</b> to be generated by ultraviolet radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.|$|E
5|$|From the hoppers, {{the waste}} falls onto the furnace-charging chute {{and from there}} onto the incinerating grate. Here it is burned at a {{temperature}} in excess of 1,200°C. <b>This</b> <b>heat</b> is then converted into super heated steam through the plant's boilers. This in turn powers steam turbines, much {{in the same way}} as a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to water. For the original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a cooling medium, whereas in the third line, water is condensed through air cooled condenser. The cooled water is treated and reused in the boilers.|$|E

5|$|Hassan was {{originally}} interested in association football {{before deciding to}} take up track and field athletics. Despite a lack of training opportunities and facilities, she was {{given the opportunity to}} participate in the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics but, since South Sudan was not yet a member of the International Olympic Committee, she competed as an Individual Olympic Athlete. She took part in the 400 m, but did not win a medal. She also attended the 2016 African Championships in Athletics, where she was eliminated in the heats of the 200 m event. For the 2016 Summer Games, she was again entered in the women's 200 m, where she was placed in heat four. <b>This</b> <b>heat</b> contained eventual gold medal-winner Elaine Thompson of Jamaica, although it was won by the Ivory Coast's Marie-Josée Ta Lou. Hassan finished eighth and last, although she set a new personal best of 26.99.|$|E
5|$|In the sub-basement {{were the}} Sprague screw {{machines}} for the electric elevators, the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, {{and the six}} Babcock & Wilcox waler tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 elevators. The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 horse power, the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. The elevators were run by it, as were the 15,000 incandescent lamps, branching from 7,500 outlets. The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced the fresh air between steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms. <b>This</b> <b>heat</b> was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in the recesses of the windows and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Owing to air {{compression}} {{in front of}} the plane as it travelled at supersonic speed, the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as 300mm (almost 1ft). The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer's console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when it shrank again. To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a heat sink for the heat from the air conditioning. The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated, and a visor was used to deflect much of <b>this</b> <b>heat</b> from directly reaching the cockpit.|$|E

50|$|In the {{vertical}} {{form of the}} De Poray boiler, the main heating surface is composed of vertical Field tubes in this secondary combustion chamber. A steel radiation bell is hung in {{the centre of the}} chamber, beneath the outlet flue, and the combustion gases are directed to pass over <b>this,</b> <b>heating</b> it. Heating of the tubes themselves is partly by convection from the gases, partly by indirect re-radiation from <b>this</b> <b>heated</b> bell. <b>This</b> permits a lower operating temperature for the tubes, also a more even <b>heating.</b> <b>This</b> is claimed by the makers to encourage more uniform boiling within the tube, thus faster steam-raising.|$|R
5|$|The volcano has two {{fields of}} fumaroles (<) {{in the area}} between Uturunku's two summits and has caused {{hydrothermal}} alteration of country rock. These fumaroles form visible clouds of steam. <b>This</b> <b>heat</b> may have been replenished from the APVC melt generating zone or survived since the last eruption of the volcano. Fumarolic activity is distinct enough to be visible from ASTER satellite image but barely visible from the ground. The temperature of the hotspot has been relatively constant in contrast to Lascar. The presence of lava flows overlying moraines, which indicate post-glacial activity, is controversial; the summit lava flows have been glaciated.|$|E
5|$|Trough systems {{convert the}} heat from the sun into electricity. Because of their {{parabolic}} shape, trough collectors can focus the sun at 30-60 times its normal intensity on a receiver pipe located along the focal line of the trough. Synthetic oil circulates through the pipe and captures <b>this</b> <b>heat,</b> reaching temperatures of 390°C (735°F). The hot oil is pumped to a generating station and routed through a heat exchanger to produce steam. Finally, electricity is produced in a conventional steam turbine. The SEGS plants operate on natural gas on cloudy days or after dark, and natural gas provides 25% of the total output.|$|E
5|$|Bradley Ally was {{the only}} Barbadian swimmer at the Beijing Olympics who competed in {{multiple}} events. Born in Barbados in 1986, Ally {{was involved in the}} Pine Crest Swim Team in Fort Lauderdale, a city in southern Florida. His first appearance at the Olympics was the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, when he represented Barbados in the men's 100meters breaststroke; the men's 200meters breaststroke; the men's 200meters individual medley; and the men's 400meters individual medley. He was 17 years old at the time. Ally returned to the Olympics as a 21-year-old. One of the events to which he returned was the men's 200meters individual medley. During the course of the men's 200meters IM, Ally was placed in the fourth heat of the August 13 preliminary round. He competed against seven other athletes in <b>this</b> <b>heat.</b> Completing the event in 1:58.57, Ally placed third ahead of British swimmer Liam Tancock (1:59.79) and behind Japan's Ken Takakuwa (1:58.51). The heat itself was led by Hungary's László Cseh (1:58.29). Of the 46 athletes who finished their races in this round, Ally ranked fifth. He advanced to the next round.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{analyzing}} the unique cracks lining Europa found evidence showing that it likely spun around a tilted axis {{at some point}} in time. If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt also could affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis means that more heat is generated by tidal forces. <b>This</b> <b>heat</b> helps the ocean to remain liquid longer. Scientists did not specify when the tilt would have occurred and measurements have not been made of the tilt of Europa's axis.|$|E
