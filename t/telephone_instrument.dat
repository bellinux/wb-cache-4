5|$|The name of Zobel is, perhaps, most {{well known}} {{with regard to}} {{impedance}} compensation networks for loudspeakers. Clearly, his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to {{this is where he}} speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable, or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a <b>telephone</b> <b>instrument</b> on a phantom circuit.|$|E

50|$|All 700 series <b>telephone</b> <b>instruments</b> {{came with}} at least one {{knockout}} forward of the switchooks, for installing bell on/bell off switches for instance. Some, however, the Tele. 710, came with four smaller knockouts and, if you looked inside the case, two circular ones too, top right and left of the dial aperture. These, along with a host of unused holes and bracketry, on the chassis, were a source of mystery for a time. Until, that is, the small business successor to the 300 series, House Exchange System 1 was revealed. The 700 series, HES 3.|$|R
60|$|She {{leaned forward}} upon the couch, her head buried in her hands. I {{felt that she}} desired silence, so I said nothing. Several moments passed, then there came a sudden and {{unexpected}} interruption. The bell of the <b>telephone</b> <b>instrument,</b> which stood between us upon the table, commenced to ring. Her hands fell from before her face. She looked across at me with parted lips and wide-open eyes. I made a movement towards the instrument, but she checked me.|$|E
60|$|They {{passed into}} the villa, and with a {{farewell}} pat of the hand Hunterleys left her and opened a door on the left-hand side of the hall. The {{young man who had}} met him coming out of the Opera was standing with his hands in his pockets, upon the hearth-rug of an exceedingly untidy-looking apartment. There was a table covered with papers, another piled with newspapers. There were books upon the floor, pipes and tobacco laid about haphazard. A space had been swept clear upon the larger table for a typewriter, a <b>telephone</b> <b>instrument</b> stood against the wall. A man whose likeness to Felicia was at once apparent, swung round in his chair as Hunterleys entered. He had taken off his coat and waistcoat and his trousers seemed smothered with dust.|$|E
60|$|She rose to {{her feet}} and sat down again. The very thought of moving nearer to the room where this man was waiting filled her with horror, and yet it was surely as {{dangerous}} to remain where she was, too far away to warn any one entering, and herself {{at the mercy of the}} conqueror in the brief struggle. Her breath began to come more quickly as she realized that she was trapped. Probably that man in the next room knew all about her, knew just why she was there, and had made up his mind how to deal with her. She found herself listening in ever-deepening horror for that turn of the handle which should signal the coming of the man for whom they both waited. Intervention of any sort would be welcome. An intervention came, in a manner as commonplace as it was startling. The bell of a <b>telephone</b> <b>instrument</b> on the top of the desk began to ring. A moment's breathless indecision, and then she walked to the instrument and took the receiver in her hand. Simultaneously she heard a stealthy movement outside. Her fellow-watcher, whoever he might be, had also made up his mind to know who was ringing up Norris Vine so late.|$|E
60|$|He {{swung around}} {{and led the}} way into a room {{at the rear of the}} hall, a room which, in {{comparison}} with Philip's confused impressions of the rest of the place, was almost plainly furnished. There was a small oak sideboard, upon which was set out whisky and soda and cigars; a great desk, covered with papers, before which a young man was seated; two <b>telephone</b> <b>instruments</b> and a phonograph. The walls were lined with books. The room itself was long and narrow. Power turned to the young man.|$|R
50|$|The {{properties}} of these signals differ between countries, but they typically have a frequency of 50 Hz, 12 kHz or 16 kHz, and a duration of several tens {{or hundreds of}} milliseconds. 50 Hz pulses are applied to the telephone circuit as common-mode signals, with respect to ground, as applying them differentially would allow the talking parties to hear 50 Hz buzz tones. These pulses are applied at relatively high voltage to distinguish them from 50 Hz power-mains-induced signals. 12- and 16 kHz metering pulses are applied differentially across the telephone circuit, as these frequencies cannot be heard by listeners with conventional <b>telephone</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|R
40|$|When {{exchange}} telephony {{was first}} marketed to the British public {{by the early}} telephone companies {{in the late nineteenth}} century it was as an intuitive technology requiring no specialist knowledge or training. This has gone unquestioned in subsequent telephone historiography but, as this article demonstrates, <b>telephone</b> <b>instruments</b> and systems were not always unproblematic or easy to use. Whilst other scholars have discussed important factors in the development and uptake of telephony, such as business economics and intellectual property, this article focuses on usage, and argues that difficulties in using <b>telephone</b> <b>instruments</b> and systems also influenced key changes in the operations of early British exchange systems. To understand these responses and developments it is necessary to look at the opinions and complaints of both users and non-users of telephone exchange systems. In investigating non-users as well as users, this article is influenced by the work of Sally Wyatt in Oudshoorn and Pinch's (2003) edited volume regarding users and non-users of technologies. Recovering the reactions of such people is possible through extensive use of letters received by the telephone companies or published in the periodical press, and opinions voiced at select committee meetings investigating the state of the country's telephone system. In recovering the difficulties early users and non-users faced when confronted with exchange telephone systems this article emphasises the importance of problematising the historical uptake of new technologies, and highlights how, in the case of early British telephony in particular, these problems can reveal specific facts both about historical telephone use-experience and about how exchange telephony spread around the country...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Some {{preliminary}} {{comparisons between}} different loudness loss estimation methods for telephone network transmission planning are presented (sidetone algorithms are not treated, however). The methods discussed are {{all based on}} objective measurements on <b>telephone</b> <b>instruments.</b> The transmission planner has some basic requirements: 1) to obtain a meaningful and reliable indication of the telephone speech transmission quality as regards the acoustic loss between the talking subscriber's mouth and the listening subscriber's ear; 2) to characterize the individual parts of a connection by numerical values {{in such a way}} that their sum equals the acoustic loss measure of the complete connection; 3) to ensure that the numerical values can be determined reliably, inexpensively and with sufficient accuracy from measurements. The third requirement means that for quality control and day-to-day use only objective | electro-acoustic measurements can be consid...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionOn {{the basis}} of the proxy {{measures}} of cognitive reserve, we created a middle age self-report risk score for early prediction of dementia. MethodsWe used a longitudinal population-based study of 2602 individuals with a replication sample (N =  1011). Risk score at a mean age of 47  years was based on questions on educational and occupational attainments. Cognitive status at a mean age of 74 was determined via two validated <b>telephone</b> <b>instruments.</b> ResultsThe prevalence of dementia was 10 % after a mean follow-up of 28  years. Risk score was a good predictor of dementia: area under the curve =  0. 77 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 74 – 0. 80). The risk of dementia decreased as a function of risk score from 36 % to 0 %. The risk score was significantly associated with cognition after a mean follow-up of 39  years in the replication sample. DiscussionSelf-report risk score predicted cognitive functioning and dementia risk 20 – 40  years later...|$|R
