In 2012, the Google Cultural Institute published an online archive containing documents and photographs owned by the Steve Biko Foundation.

5|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with human papillomavirus (HPV), which has also been implicated in cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. Almost 300 million women worldwide have been infected with HPV, one of the commoner sexually transmitted infections, and 5% of the 13 million new cases of cancer in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> attributed to HPV. In developed countries, screening for cervical cancer using the Pap test has identified pre-cancerous changes in the cervix, at least in those women with access to health care. Also an HPV vaccine programme is available in 45 countries. Screening and prevention programmes have limited availability in developing countries although inexpensive low technology programmes are being developed, but access to treatment is also limited. If applied globally, HPV vaccination at 70% coverage could {{save the lives of}} 4 million women from cervical cancer, since most cases occur in developing countries.|$|E
5|$|With the expiry of the copyrights, {{companies}} around <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> free {{to produce}} Gilbert and Sullivan works and to adapt {{them as they}} please for almost 50 years. Productions of Pinafore, both amateur and professional, range from the traditional, in the D'Oyly Carte vein, to the broadly adapted, {{such as that of}} the very successful Essgee Entertainment (formed by Simon Gallaher) in Australia and Opera della Luna in Britain. Since its original production, H.M.S. Pinafore has remained one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most popular comic operas. Productions continue in large numbers around the world. In 2003 alone, The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company rented 224 sets of orchestra parts, mostly for productions of Pinafore, Pirates and Mikado. This {{does not take into account}} other rental companies and the theatre companies that borrow scores or have their own, or that use only one or two pianos instead of an orchestra. Hundreds of productions of Pinafore are presented every year worldwide.|$|E

In a few cases such as the Omani blind cavefish (Oman garra), zoos have initiated breeding programs as a safeguard. In contrast to the rarer species, the cave form of the Mexican tetra is easily bred in captivity and widely available to aquarists. This is the most studied cavefish species and likely also the most studied cave organism overall. As of 2006, only six other cavefish species have been bred in captivity, typically by scientists.|$|E
