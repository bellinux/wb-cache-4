5|$|Construction {{began on}} May 5, 1931, under Brother Theophorus Kleemann, SVD, who became ill and died on September 12, 1931; Arthur Bialucha, a German {{architect}} living in Qingdao {{who had already}} completed several projects for the SVD, took over as construction superintendent. Construction was frustrated in 1933, when Adolf Hitler {{came to power in}} Germany and prohibited the transfer of money overseas. The diocese independently shouldered the cost of finishing the cathedral. This required a number of design changes to reduce costs. The changes are evident in drawings published before completion of construction, which show <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of the towers as bell-shaped. However, <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of the completed structure were changed to spires. Construction was finished in 1934, and the cathedral was consecrated on October 28 that year.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{had noticed}} one {{potential}} {{flaw in the}} defences. <b>The</b> <b>roofs</b> were flat and unprotected; he demanded to know if a glider, such as the DFS 230, could land on them.

5|$|The {{outer walls}} of the church are {{constructed}} of red sandstone with grey ashlar dressings; <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> are slate.

5|$|The {{ships were}} {{equipped}} with Krupp cemented armor. The level of armor {{protection for the}} Moltke class was increased from the Von der Tann design, to 10cm (3.9in) in the forward main belt, 27cm (10.6in) in the citadel, and 10cm (3.9in) aft. The casemates were protected by 15cm (5.9in) vertically and 3.5cm (1.4in) on <b>the</b> <b>roofs.</b> The forward conning tower was protected by 35cm (14in), and the aft tower had 20cm (7.9in) of armor. The turrets had 23cm (9.1in) on the face, 18cm (7.1in) on the sides, and 9cm (3.5in) on <b>the</b> <b>roofs.</b> The deck armor and sloping armor were both 5cm (2.0in), as was the torpedo bulkhead around the barbettes. The torpedo bulkhead was 3cm (1.2in) in other, less critical areas. As with Von der Tann, the armor was Krupp cemented and nickel steel.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey {{house and}} the chapel are built of the local Blue Lias stone.

Grow rapidly built <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> structure from <b>the</b> center out, but encountered difficulty engineering the semicircular ends of <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> This difficulty dragged structural work on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> into fall of 1866 even as other parts of <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> were being shingled. However, Grow finished and shingled <b>the</b> entire <b>roof</b> by <b>the</b> spring of 1867, before {{the interior of the}} building was finished.

5|$|A fire {{accident}} occurred in 1793 that destroyed the large gallery that connected the chapel {{to the north}} tower, and the west face of the large central tower was seriously damaged. The fire spread along <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> and turrets of the northwest wing, and {{the upper part of}} the north tower was also burned. The chapel was sacked, and the flames destroyed its facade and part of its north wall. The crypt was not damaged. Most of the floors and fireplaces in the château and all the doors, windows and woodwork were irreparably destroyed.|$|E
5|$|After the war many castles were slighted, damaged to {{put them}} beyond {{military}} use, but Parliament {{was concerned about the}} threat of a royalist invasion from Scotland and Beaumaris was spared. Colonel John Jones became the castle governor and a garrison was installed inside, at a cost of £1,703 a year. When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660 and restored the Bulkeley family as castle constables, Beaumaris appears to have been stripped of its valuable lead and remaining resources, including <b>the</b> <b>roofs.</b>|$|E
