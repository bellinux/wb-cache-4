500|$|The {{inclusion}} of a Native American character in Star Trek: Voyager was suggested {{at an early stage}} {{in the development of the}} series. The producers were looking for an ethnic background which had not been seen before as a main character in the franchise. It was hoped that a Native American character would prove to be an inspiration in the same way that the appearance of Uhura in [...] later inspired Whoopi Goldberg and other African Americans. Executive producer Jeri Taylor said, [...] "It seemed to us that Native Americans needed <b>that</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> of role model and <b>that</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> of boost... the future looks good, you have purpose, you have worth, you have value, you will be leaders, you will be powerful. That was one character choice we had early on." [...] Taylor's notes from the early production in July 1993 describe the character as [...] "First Officer – a human native American male, a 'Queequeg' person who has renounced Earth and lives as an expatriate on another planet. A mystical, mysterious man with whom the Captain has some prior connection, not explained." [...] A month later, this description was expanded with the line, [...] "This man has made another choice – to re-enter the world of Starfleet." [...] Chakotay was not the first Native American character to appear in the franchise, with [...] "The Paradise Syndrome" [...] in the [...] of Star Trek: The Original Series showing a group of displaced humans following a Native-American-like culture.|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{recorded}} her {{scenes from}} January 6–8, 1996. She {{had a relationship}} with cast member Matthew Perry at the time and an audience member said about their on-screen kiss, [...] "Julia looked at Matt and said 'I'm glad we rehearsed this over the weekend'." [...] A sound recordist commented: [...] "I've seen screen kisses before but this was the best. They really went at it." [...] Roberts thought her appearance on the show was [...] "the most nerve-wracking thing" [...] she had done since auditioning for Pretty Woman. [...] "I wanted to be the best I could be. [...] is incredibly funny, and you want to inspire <b>that</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> of joy that he does. Then at a certain point at lunch, you go, 'Well, it ain't gonna happen. I'll just try to be cute.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Gagged was {{mastered}} by Tom Coyne {{and produced}} and mixed by Tomas Costanza. The song [...] "Bettie" [...] {{was produced by}} American drummer Tommy Lee. Concerning her working relationship with Lee, Chachki commented: [...] "I'm so honored to even {{have the opportunity to}} do it. I've listened to lots of different music that has <b>that</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> of (industrial) feel to it." [...] Chachki described the music as [...] "dark and industrial." [...] The songs were influenced by the work of EDM artists: Purity Ring, Ladytron, Miss Kittin, and The Presets. When discussing her vocal performance on the EP, she described it as [...] "more sexy talking and raspy vocals, dark and fetishy." [...] While promoting the project, Chachki distanced herself from being identified as a singer, and said: [...] "I never set out to be a popstar." ...|$|E

500|$|Director Csupó {{stated that}} they had no actors {{initially}} in mind for the film. The first actor cast was AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie Burke. Robb wrote Csupó [...] "such a beautiful, heartwarming letter" [...] that expressed her love for the book and the character. Csupó said that he cast her because of [...] "her letter, her enthusiasm, and her love of the material". Robb also conversed with producer Lauren Levine before casting even began, and [...] "their conversation convinced her that, without a doubt, AnnaSophia was meant for this role". Levine said that [...] "it was just so clear in talking to her about all this fantasy that I was basically talking to Leslie, that she had <b>that</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> of spark and magical presence. She might be physically different from Leslie in the book, but the spirit of Leslie and the spirit of AnnaSophia are nearly identical. It was a match made in heaven." [...] With regard to the character, Robb said [...] "'s one of those people who's just always lit up, who has this glow about her, and no one can bring her down. Leslie's such a lively and energetic character, it was really fun for me to become her." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Dr. John Lane, {{director}} of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, in 1997, although Van Vliet's work has associations with mainstream abstract expressionist painting, more importantly he was a self-taught artist and his painting [...] "has <b>that</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> of edge the music has". [...] Curator David Breuer asserts that {{in contrast to the}} busied, bohemian urban lives of the New York abstract expressionists, the rural desert environment Van Vliet was influenced by is a distinctly naturalistic one, making him a distinguished figure in contemporary art, whose work will survive in canon. Van Vliet stated of his own work, [...] "I'm trying to turn myself inside out on the canvas. I'm trying to completely bare what I think at that moment" [...] and that, [...] "I paint {{for the simple reason that}} I have to. I feel a sense of relief after I do." [...] When asked about his artistic influences he stated that there were none. [...] "I just paint like I paint and that's enough influence." [...] He did however state his admiration of Georg Baselitz, the De Stijl artist Piet Mondrian, and Vincent van Gogh; after seeing van Gogh's paintings in person, Van Vliet quoted himself as saying that, [...] "The sun disappoints me so." ...|$|E
2500|$|After United Artists {{declined}} to budget the film, Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz presented the film treatment to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it rejected its {{options for the}} film because the concept was [...] "a little strange", and it said that Lucas should follow American Graffiti with more consequential themes. Lucas said, [...] "I've always been an outsider to Hollywood types. They think I do weirdo films." [...] According to Kurtz, Lew Wasserman, the studio's head, [...] "just didn't think much of science fiction at that time, didn't think it had much of a future then, with that particular audience." [...] He said that [...] "science fiction wasn't popular in the mid-'70s ... {{what seems to be}} the case generally is that the studio executives are looking for what was popular last year, rather than trying to look forward to what might be popular next year." [...] Lucas explained in 1977 that the film is not [...] "about the future" [...] and that it [...] "is a fantasy much closer to the Brothers Grimm than it is to [...] ". He added: [...] "My main reason for making it was to give young people an honest, wholesome fantasy life, the kind my generation had. We had westerns, pirate movies, all kinds of great things. Now they have The Six Million Dollar Man and Kojak. Where are the romance, the adventure, and the fun that used to be in practically every movie made?" [...] Kurtz said, [...] "Although Star Wars wasn't like that at all, it was just sort of lumped into <b>that</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> of [...] category." ...|$|E

So I was not surprised, still later on in my life, to recognize instantly, the first time I saw them, trees such as the spruce, the yew, the birch, and the laurel.
