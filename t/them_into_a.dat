5|$|Americium is an {{artificial}} element of recent origin, and thus {{does not have}} a biological requirement. It is harmful to life. It has been proposed to use bacteria for removal of americium and other heavy metals from rivers and streams. Thus, Enterobacteriaceae of the genus Citrobacter precipitate americium ions from aqueous solutions, binding <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> metal-phosphate complex at their cell walls. Several studies have been reported on the biosorption and bioaccumulation of americium by bacteria and fungi.|$|E

Meeting with him, a thorn suddenly leaps from Krile's palm, manifesting as Exdeath, now resurrected and fully {{in command of the}} Void. With it, he removes entire towns and kingdoms from existence, tossing <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tear in reality.|$|E

While he waits, Lanyon speaks with Newcome, Rebecca, Agnes and Mrs. Lanyon. After the others leave, Hyde arrives for the powder and liquid. After arguing with Lanyon, he mixes <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> potion and drinks it; he immediately transforms into Jekyll.|$|E

Simultaneously, Church assembled all the combat service support soldiers he could and formed <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> combat unit to block further penetration of North Korean forces, which were setting up roadblocks on the roads from Yongsan.|$|E
5|$|Wholesale funding {{disappeared}} in September 2008 {{leading to the}} collapse of Glitnir, Kaupthing and Landsbanki. Due {{to the size of the}} combined balance sheet of those banks the government of Iceland did not have the means to save those banks. They were put into receivership instead with their boards replaced. Nevertheless, the failed banks were restructured by dividing <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> new and an old bank in order to avoid a credit crunch.|$|E
5|$|Archaeoastronomy uses {{a variety}} of methods to uncover {{evidence}} of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.|$|E

5|$|Blake {{tries to}} shoot West with a shotgun, but the blasts {{do not stop}} West, who throws the sheriff over the railing into power lines, killing him. West hits Nelson and knocks him over the railing, leaving the doctor hanging on the side. Nelson appeals to West, {{reminding}} him that they were friends, and West decides to pull Nelson to safety. Two armed security guards then arrive and, in a panic, fatally shoot Nelson in the face {{as he tries to}} protect West. An infuriated West kills the security guards and stumbles away. After collapsing against the side of a building, he slowly melts completely away. The next morning, a janitor finds his gory remains and casually mops <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> garbage can. The film ends with a radio news report about another astronaut team being sent to Saturn.|$|E
5|$|In 1536, Netley Abbey {{was seized}} by Henry VIII of England during the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the {{buildings}} granted to William Paulet, a wealthy Tudor politician, who converted <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> mansion. The abbey {{was used as a}} country house until the beginning of the eighteenth century, after which it was abandoned and partially demolished for building materials. Subsequently the ruins became a tourist attraction, and provided inspiration to poets and artists of the Romantic movement. In the early twentieth century the site was given to the nation, and it is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument, cared for by English Heritage. The extensive remains consist of the church, cloister buildings, abbot's house, and fragments of the post-Dissolution mansion. Netley Abbey {{is one of the best}} preserved medieval Cistercian monasteries in southern England.|$|E
5|$|In early 1977, TSR {{created the}} first element of a two-pronged {{strategy}} that would divide D for nearly two decades. A Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up {{the presentation of the}} essential rules, made the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores. Later in 1977, the first part of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD) was published, which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the Basic Set directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.|$|E

5|$|Its closest {{relative}} is {{the black}} currawong (S. fuliginosa) of Tasmania, which has sometimes been considered a subspecies. Together with the larger grey currawong (S. versicolor), they form the genus Strepera. Although crow-like in appearance and habits, currawongs are only distantly related to true crows, and instead belong to the family Artamidae, together with the closely related Australian magpie and the butcherbirds. The affinities of all three genera were recognised early on and they {{were placed in the}} family Cracticidae in 1914 by ornithologist John Albert Leach after he had studied their musculature. Ornithologists Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between woodswallows and butcherbirds in 1985, and combined <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Cracticini clade, which became the family Artamidae.|$|E
5|$|Many {{military}} events {{occurred during}} Clinton's presidency. The Battle of Mogadishu occurred in Somalia in 1993. During the operation, two U.S. helicopters {{were shot down}} by rocket-propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets—a spectacle broadcast on television news programs. In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground. In 1995, U.S. and NATO aircraft attacked Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and to pressure <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> peace accord. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement.|$|E
5|$|Martin began curling {{when he was}} {{six years}} old. He took up the sport because his father was the vice {{president}} of his local curling club. Martin first came on the curling scene in 1985 when his Alberta team of Richard Feeney, Dan Petryk and Michael Berger won the Canadian Junior Championships in their first year together as a team. The rink (a group of players) finished the round robin in second place, with a win-loss record of 7–4, behind Prince Edward Island's Kent Scales. This forced <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> semifinal against the third place Quebec rink, skipped by Steve Gagnon. They beat Quebec 5–4, earning a spot in the final against Prince Edward Island which they won with a score of 6–3. After winning the championship, he accompanied the Canadian team as an alternate at the 1985 World Junior Curling Championships.|$|E

Back at the police station, Mooney is innundated with calls from townspeople reporting incidents with the klowns, but he dismisses all of them. Soon after, a klown arrives at the station and Mooney arrests it, believing it to be a teen prankster. Dave returns to the station to find two prisoners encased in cocoons, and the now escaped klown using a deceased Mooney as a ventriloquist's dummy. Dave shoots the klown several times before destroying its nose, which causes it to spin wildly and explode.|$|E
