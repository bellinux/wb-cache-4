30|$|Estimating {{the stock}} of {{migrants}} from the two migrant-sending countries in the respective migrant-receiving countries is complicated due to naturalization—which differs both in nature and scope between {{the east and west}} corridors. In all corridors, the first (and second) generation has given rise to the second and third generations born in the migrant-receiving country. In Belgium and France, this gives rise to the right of citizenship latest at the age of majority as the principle of “ius solis” applies; in addition, newcomers may acquire citizenship according to the rule of <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>presence</b> and gainful occupation. In Austria and Germany, the principle of “ius sanguinis” applies, whereby the right to citizenship depends on at least one parent having citizenship, while again newcomers may acquire citizenship according to the rule of <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>presence</b> and gainful occupation, although the specific criteria have changed over time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With {{the surge}} in location-aware {{applications}} and prevalence of RFID tags comes a demand for providing location proof service with minimal cost. We introduce two protocols that provide secure and accurate location proof service using passive RFID tags. Both protocols are lightweight, adaptive and cost-effective. The first protocol assumes the connection of a user to the remote server. The second protocol does not require real time interactions with the server. Instead, it uses the selfreported time of local RFID reader (such as a cell phone), which may be biased. The user can upload {{the information to the}} server later to obtain the location proof. The paper presents a solution to derive users’ actual <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>presence</b> {{in the absence of a}} reliable clock, assuming an arbitrarily large number of falsified data points from malicious users. ...|$|E

30|$|It {{has been}} found that the effects of foreign direct {{investment}} are dynamic (Merlevede et al. 2014). In fact, host economy benefits from presence of majority foreign-owned companies, and it depends on the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>presence</b> of the foreign entrant into domestic market, hence the longer—the better. The literature gives general guidelines on negative (horizontal) effects, but it is usually explained on short-term bases and damaged competitive characteristics of domestic companies. When only the impact of entry is analyzed, the results show that there are only modest outcomes. However, most that benefit from immediate foreign entry are local suppliers, and thus within first few years of entry, local suppliers have considerable growth because of enhanced business relations with the majority foreign-owned companies. As time goes by, the effects become lighter. Nonetheless, post-entry effects last longer and it is due to increased competitive characteristics of domestic cooperants and newly formed start-ups (Xu and Sheng 2012).|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} I suggest a {{different}} view on Sophiatown’s existence, {{both in terms of}} it standing as mythical icon and as a suburb. Instead of continuing the look ‘from afar’ (Hannerz 1994), which positions Sophiatown within the category of desirable ‘global icons’, I turn my gaze deeper into Sophiatown, both as a suburb and an icon. I use the lens of transnationalism to zoom into three scenes in Sophiatown in order to examine what has been ignored and overlooked in previous nar-ratives. Where the global icon stays and focuses on the surface, the transnational perspective focuses on the everyday lives within the icon. Through a series of vignettes, looking at women in Sophiatown’s history, at coffee making with a Greek immigrant, and tales of home with Senegalese businessmen, through a consideration of Bloke Modisane’s post-Sophiatown career, I examine how the time established by focusing on these transnational lives is a <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>presence</b> which spans mul-tiple locations. I conclude the article with a final point about the ‘unrepresentability’ of a diverse history in the current ways of narrating history in Sophiatown; and the necessity of extending spaces of representation for other, alternative perspectives...|$|E

Because a successful education {{is based on the}} cooperation of learner and teacher, the aim of this survey was to determine and compare the opinions of mothers and nurses about the postnatal educational needs. Fifty-one postnatal nurses (Nurse, midwife and nurse assistant) and 70 mothers, during the first 24 hours of post delivery, completed the standard McMolen’s questionnaire. We found that although postnatal educational needs of mothers and nurses were roughly similar, but the mean scores of educational needs in two groups were significantly different, so that the needs were more important for mothers. Also primipara mothers and those with low educational level, had higher educational needs. Compared to the western surveys, the postnatal educational needs were more important for both mothers and nurses in our stud. This difference could be due to less attendance of mothers to prenatal courses, low educational level, primiparity and cultural differences. Our results re-affirm the importance of cooperation of mothers and nurses to determine the postnatal educational needs...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Gap {{acceptance}} {{behavior is}} critical to the safety and operational performance of unsignalized intersections. The complex nature of the human behavior and its dependence on various socioeconomic and environmental parameters makes it challenging for transportation professionals to assess the performance of such intersections. To investigate the behavioral patterns of drivers at unsignalized intersections, a novel procedure was developed and validated for the accurate observation of naturalistic gap acceptance behavior. Specifically, the authors examined two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) intersections with a two way left turn lane (TWLTL) on the major road. After examining the critical gap and identifying behavioral changes caused by waiting <b>time,</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> day, <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> passengers, and <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> queue, the authors further investigated the relationship between waiting time and gap acceptance and analyzed the variations in waiting time for right and left turn maneuvers. The results of this study reinforce the notion that driver behavior is affected by external factors such as waiting <b>time,</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> day, <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> passengers, <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> queue, etc. and should continue to be investigated in localities across the country...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates how {{spontaneous}} {{interaction in}} an R&D environment {{is affected by}} temporary absence form the work site. Previous studies has shown the central importance of spontaneous interaction in R&D activities, but not how this {{is linked to the}} amount of co-presence. By using work diaries to collect data on time spent on spontaneous interaction, two groups are studied, one working form a remote location for part of the time, and one working at the central location all the time. The assumption is that spontaneous interaction is either constant during time of co-presence, or it is saved until <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>presence.</b> In the later case this would result in more spontaneous interaction when present. The results from the study show that the spontaneous interaction is directly linked to the amount of time the person is present, and that no compensation is made for the time of absence. Spontaneous interaction takes place when opportunities occur, and lost opportunities are not compensated for by more spontaneous interaction when opportunity is given later. This has implications for geographical dispersion in environments where spontaneous interaction is vital such as in R&D settings and in managerial roles. Part-time geographical separation will decrease the amount of spontaneous interaction i...|$|E
30|$|Other {{clues that}} this feature was {{produced}} {{by the arrival of}} the upwelling over KTB are the presence of ionogram signatures (e.g., Tsunoda, 2008, 2009; Thampi et al. 2012), which were observed, as indicated in Fig.  12. For example, the two short vertical lines indicate times when satellite traces (STs) were detected, just prior to the arrival of the upwelling. Near the dip equator, STs {{have been shown to be}} oblique echoes from tilted isodensity surfaces, such as those associated with the walls of an upwelling. The STs were followed by range spread F (RSF), whose <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>presence</b> is indicated by the orange horizontal bar. We see that RSF appeared around the time when the upwelling crest arrived over KTB, and it continued until the upwelling had passed. This association of RSF with the trailing portion of the upwelling is consistent with RSF occurring along the west wall of an upwelling (Tsunoda, 1981, 1983, 2005). The presence of RSF over KTB is also consistent with the onset of RSF over CPN, at the time of upwelling appearance. The implication is that the upwelling extended north-south along the bottomside of the F layer into both hemispheres (e.g., Weber et al. 1978, 1996) and drifted eastward with time, not unlike the behavior of the striation in Fig.  9 (Tsunoda et al. 2016 a).|$|E
40|$|Background & aim: Anxiety is {{a normal}} feeling which is {{experienced}} in threatening situations and can affect neural system. Wide spread of anxiety forces many people to permanent use of anti-stress drugs especially benzodiazepines. This study was carried out to compare the effects of balm extract and diazepam on anxiety adjustment. Methods: In this experimental study 70 female mice weighing approximately 25 to 30 g were studied in seven treatments groups including control, placebo, anxiety, diazepam, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg of balm’s hydro-alcoholic extract. Drug and extract doses were injected IP. After receiving the last dose, anxiety was induced using dark box and was evaluated by an elevated plus-maze. In order to increase the activity, the animals were kept in a box with black walls for 5 minutes. Then, in order to evaluate the response of anxiety in elevated plus maze transferred and count the {{time spent in the}} open arms for 5 minutes (as an indicator of anxiety) were observed and recorded. Obtained data were analyzed using SPSS 11. 5 software. Results: The results of tests on the treatment showed that the hydro alcoholic extract in 200 mg/kg dose increased the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>presence</b> in open arms significantly which shows anxiety reduction. Also, movement activities of mice were significantly higher in this dose in proportion to diazepam. Conclusion: According to results, hydro alcoholic extract of balm in 200 mg/kg dose can be a suitable replacement for diazepam in reducing anxiety reflexes...|$|E

40|$|A {{valuable}} {{strategy to}} improve crop yield consists {{in the use}} of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs). However, the influence of PGPR colonization on plant physiology is largely unknown. PGPR Burkholderia phytofirmans strain PsJN (Bp PsJN) colonized only Arabidopsis thaliana roots after seed or soil inoculation. Foliar bacteria were detected only after leaf infiltration. Since, different bacterial times of presence and/or locations in host plant could lead to different plant physiological responses, photosynthesis, and metabolite profiles in A. thaliana leaves were thus investigated following leaf, root, or seed inoculation with Bp PsJN, Only Bp PsJN leaf colonization transiently decreased cyclic electron transport and effective quantum yield of photosystem I (PSI), and prevented a decrease in net photosynthesis and stomatal opening compared to the corresponding control. Metabolomic analysis revealed that soluble sugars, amino acids or their derivatives accumulated differently in all Bp PsJN-inoculated plants. Octanoic acid accumulated only in case of inoculated plants. Modifications in vitamin, organic acid such as tricarboxylic acid intermediates, and hormone amounts were dependent on bacterial <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>presence</b> and location. Additionally, a larger array of amino acids and hormones (auxin, cytokinin, abscisic acid) were modified by seed inoculation with Bp PsJN. Our work thereby provides evidence that relative short-term inoculation with Bp PsJN altered physiological status of A. thaliana leaves, whereas long-term bacterization triggered modifications on a larger set of metabolites. Our data highlighted the changes displayed during this plant microbe interaction to trigger physiological and metabolic responses that could explain the increase in plant growth or stress tolerance conferred by the presence of Bp PsJN...|$|E
40|$|Mapping the pleasantness of {{an urban}} {{environment}} is an alternative approach, closer to the city dweller's perception, than standardized sound levels cartography. This study reports on modeling pleasantness in urban context using perceptual assessments and sound measurements for specific locations during an urban walk. These assessments have been collected from four groups of approximately ten participants on 19 different assessment locations, along a 2. 1 km-long path traveled in both directions. Simultaneously, 1 / 3 -octave band sound levels and audio were recorded. Perceptual and physical models of pleasantness are proposed for specific locations based on multiple linear regressions. A multilevel analysis was performed, and it is shown that a perceptual model that includes perceived loudness joined to the perceived <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>presence</b> of traffic, voices and birds explains 90 % of the pleasantness variance due to the sound environment variations. Physical models that include the original acoustic indicators that are most correlated with perceptual variables explain 85 % of this variance. Thanks to these models, a unique averaged pleasantness value is defined for each assessment location from the perceptual or physical collected assessments. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the averaged perceived pleasantness and the modeled values from perceptual assessment reaches r(19) = 0. 98, and r(19) = 0. 97, with the modeled values from physical measurements. These results {{make it possible to}} consider the use of this kind of models in a cartographic context. As the path was traveled in both directions, the presentation-order effect has also been assessed, and it has been found that path direction did not {{have a significant impact on}} the pleasantness assessment at specific locations, except when very strong sound environment changes occurred. Finally, the study gives some insights about the retrospective global pleasantness assessment for urban walks. For very short walks between two assessment locations, a recency effect is shown. Nevertheless, this effect doesn't seem to be significant when longer routes are assessed...|$|E
40|$|The North Eastern Alps (Friuli Venezia Giulia Region) {{represent}} a peripheral area of {{presence of the}} Dinaric population (for the North Dinaric population, Slovenia, 400 - 450 individuals estimated) of the Brown Bear; in this area {{in the last years}} some individuals has started to come from Trentino population (40 - 45 individuals estimated) and to use this areas. In previous 114 researches this area has been {{considered one of the most}} suitable areas, in the alps, for supporting the alpine brown bear population and for enhancing the creation of the alpine metapopulation. From 2004 to the 2013 in mountains areas of the Friuli Venezia Giulia has been studied (2500 km 2) the presence of the Brown Bear with different techniques: the genetic sampling (by opportunistic and systematic methods), photo interpretation and behavioral analysis and radiotelemetry. The genetic samplings have been obtained by the hair traps (50 permanent hair traps plus 80 temporary and moving hair traps) and by opportunistic techniques. By the genetic analysis it has detected the presence, from 2004, of 21 different genotypes (4 from Trentino and 17 from the Dinaric population, 3 of them studied by telemetry), all of them were males. The number of genotypes detected in different year has showed a cyclic pattern, with a increment in the last year, due to dispersing individuals from Dinaric source population; in different years, from 3 to 8 (2013), different genotypes have been detected, with a evident turnover. The median <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>presence</b> (years of sampling), for each genotypes, was 2 years, and only 6 genotypes have been sampled for 3 or more years (1 from Trentino); 10 genotypes have been sampled in only one year. Despite to the increment of the Trentino population and the high density of the Dinaric populations, in the north eastern alps the process of immigration and colonization appears to be slow and intermittent and seems correlated more to the demographic aspects (i. e localization and philopatry of the females, now present only in the Alpine and Dinaric areas of Slovenia and on the right side of Adige river, in Trentino), management of the Dinaric population, dispersal behavior and presence of not permeable infrastructure (high way Ljubljana-Trieste) rather than the ecological values of the areas...|$|E
