5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>bottom</b> right corner, two Polish Jews are on {{the edge}} of the scene; the younger (36) one is usually {{described}} as enthralled by the events, watching them with hope, but most analysis focuses on the older man (37), whose hand is making a Sy, git ("that's good") gesture. Interpretation of this figure varies; while some suggest that he express his interest and support for the Constitution, which he sees as a promise of further reforms that will improve the situation of the Jews—the Constitution had not addressed them in any significant way—others put him, or both of the Jews, among the opponents of the Constitution, describing them as frowning and disturbed, gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth, or at least concerned with the liberal reforms. The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews in his paintings in negative roles.|$|E
5|$|The coinage metals were {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} a subdivision of the alkali metal group, due to them sharing the characteristic s1 electron configuration of the alkali metals (group 1: p6s1; group 11: d10s1). However, the similarities are largely confined to the stoichiometries of the +1 compounds of both groups, and not their chemical properties. This stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell, so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals. Furthermore, they have higher melting points, hardnesses, and densities, and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid ammonia, as well as having more covalent character in their compounds. Finally, the alkali metals {{are at the top}} of the electrochemical series, whereas the coinage metals are almost at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>bottom.</b> The coinage metals' filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals' filled p shell, so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower, enabling higher oxidation states than +1 and a richer coordination chemistry, thus giving the group 11 metals clear transition metal character. Particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium, in which it forms the auride ion (Au−) which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution: here gold behaves as a pseudohalogen because its 5d106s1 configuration has one electron less than the quasi-closed shell 5d106s2 configuration of mercury.|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanism}} of the condensation of e-h pairs in bulk GaAs at room temperature, which has been observed earlier, is proposed. The {{point is that the}} photon assisted pairing happens in a system of electrons and holes that occupy energy levels at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>bottoms</b> of <b>the</b> bands. Due to a very high e-h density, the destruction of the pairs and loss of coherency does not occur because almost all energy levels inside a 30 - 60 meV band {{from the bottom of the}} conduction band prove to be occupied. As a result, a coherent ensemble of composite bosons (paired electrons and holes) with the minimum possible energy appears. The lifetime of this strongly non-equilibrium coherent e-h BCS-like state is as short as a few hundred of femtosecondsComment: 10 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

25|$|Metal halide {{lights are}} {{generally}} the highest output lighting commercially available. They produce about 90-100 {{lumens per watt}} of power. This is roughly the same as fluorescent. The improvement with metal halides is that they concentrate this light output into a very small space, whereas fluorescent lights evenly illuminate the entire aquarium. This {{is often referred to}} as point source lighting, and is what causes the rippling visual effect on many advanced aquarium setups. This concentration of light output increases the intensity, allowing metal halide lamps to penetrate light to even <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>bottom</b> levels of most aquariums. Metal halides are available in many color temperatures, from 6500 K up to 20,000 K, though bulbs as high as 50,000 K are occasionally found.

40|$|Serial {{observations}} of temperature, salinity, oxygen, alkalinity and pH are presented. They {{were carried out}} during an anchor station of R. V.

Two observational results are pointed out: The Mediterranean water masses spread out into the Atlantic Ocean, consisting of two distinct layers at depth of 700 m (T= 12. 0 °C, S= 36. 15 ?) and 1250 m (T= 11. 3 °C, S= 36. 40 ?). The salinity proved to be the most significant indicator of the observed stratification. The values of dissolved oxygen content, alkalinity and pH in <b>the</b> <b>very</b> near <b>bottom</b> layer (1 m above the bottom at depth of 3250 m) are different from the values at depth of 15 m to 100 m above the bottom.

40|$|Free {{standing}} diamond {{films were}} used to study the effect of diamond surface morphology and microstructure on the electrical properties of Schottky barrier diodes. By using free standing films both the rough top diamond surface and <b>the</b> <b>very</b> smooth <b>bottom</b> surface are available for post-metal deposition. Rectifying electrical contacts were then established either with the smooth or the rough surface. The estimate of doping density from the capacitance-voltage plots shows that the smooth surface has a lower doping density {{when compared with the}} top layers of the same film. The results also show that surface roughness does not contribute significantly to the frequency dispersion of the small signal capacitance. The electrical properties of an abrupt asymmetric n(+) (silicon) -p(diamond) junction have also been measured. The I-V curves exhibit at low temperatures a plateau near zero bias, and show inversion of rectification. Capacitance-voltage characteristics show a capacitance minimum with forward bias, which is dependent on the environment conditions. It is proposed that this anomalous effect arises from high level injection of minority carriers into the bulk...|$|R

The lamellulae (short gills that do not extend completely from the cap margin to the stem) are truncate (cut off sharply) to attenuate. The stem is [...] long and [...] wide, equal or tapering slightly toward apex, whitish, and [...] to smooth. The basal bulb is club-shaped, - or turnip-shaped, rounded or pointed, usually covered with rings of reddish-brown scales or warts of universal veil remains, often extending up the stem for a short distance. The universal veil on the stem base is quite unusual in Amanita, because it forms warts that extend nearly to <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>bottom</b> of the bulb.
