5|$|Sea otters, whose {{numbers were}} once {{estimated}} at 150,000–300,000, were hunted extensively for their fur between 1741 and 1911, {{and the world}} population fell to 1,000–2,000 individuals living in a fraction of <b>their</b> <b>historic</b> range. A subsequent international ban on hunting, conservation efforts, and reintroduction programs into previously populated areas have contributed to numbers rebounding, and the species now occupies about two-thirds of its former range. The recovery of the sea otter is considered an important success in marine conservation, although populations in the Aleutian Islands and California have recently declined or have plateaued at depressed levels. For these reasons, the sea otter remains classified as an endangered species.|$|E
