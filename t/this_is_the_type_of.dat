5|$|Muscle cells (myocytes) {{form the}} active {{contractile}} tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility {{over a wide}} range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.|$|E

2500|$|Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 498 (1998), is a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act (Coal Act) {{constituted}} an unconstitutional regulatory taking of property which required the Act to be invalidated. [...] The import of this decision is that it was made {{in the context of a}} purely economic regulation. [...] The plurality examines the statute and its resultant harm as an ad hoc factual inquiry based on factors delineated in Penn Central such as the economic impact of the regulation, its interference with reasonable investment backed expectations, and the character of the governmental action.(Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City), The decision thereby moved beyond the traditional notions of equal protection which had been applied to economic regulation since the time of (Lochner v. New York), requiring extreme deference to Congress, and applied a regulatory takings analysis to the problem resulting in a much less deferential result. [...] While the plurality recognizes that this is not a traditional takings case where the government appropriates private property for public use, they also state <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> case where the [...] "Armstrong Principle" [...] of preventing the government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.
