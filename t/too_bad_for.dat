A third {{member of the}} group raised the alarm by mobile telephone by 14:05 (GMT), less than five minutes after Shaw had been swept away, and Devon and Cornwall Police, a Royal Navy helicopter and the Dartmoor Rescue Group were mobilised to search for Shaw. Believing that the weather conditions may be <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> the helicopter to fly, members of the Dartmoor Rescue Group—a volunteer organisation which co-ordinates the four separate charities who undertake search and rescue operations on Dartmoor—set out on foot in an attempt to reach the scene of the accident.|$|E
500|$|There {{was long}} {{confusion}} regarding the taxonomic status and geographic {{origin of the}} small island emu taxa from King Island and Kangaroo Island, since specimens of both populations were transported to France {{as part of the}} same French expedition to Australia in the early 1800s. The logbooks of the expedition failed to clearly state where and when the small emu individuals were collected, and this has resulted in a plethora of scientific names subsequently being coined for either bird, many on questionable grounds, and the idea that all specimens had originated from Kangaroo Island. Furthermore, in 1914, L. Brasil argued the expedition did not encounter emus on King Island, because the weather had been <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> them to leave their camp. The French also referred to both emus and cassowaries as [...] "casoars" [...] at the time, which has led to further confusion.|$|E
500|$|She was {{refitted}} and modernised from January to August 1948. Captain John Hughes-Hallett relieved Edwards on 14 June. The {{ship was}} recommissioned in early September. While at anchor in Portland Harbour on 17 October, {{one of her}} boats foundered [...] short of the ship in heavy weather; 29 men lost their lives. Illustrious resumed her duties in early 1949 and conducted trials and training for Avengers, Fireflies, Gloster Meteors, de Havilland Sea Hornets, Vampires and Seafires. On 10 June Hughes-Hallet was relieved by Captain Eric Clifford. During a severe gale in late October, the ship aided the small coastal steamer [...] that had lost power. The weather was <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> Illustrious to rescue the steamer's crew, but she pumped oil overboard to flatten the seas until a tug arrived to rescue the ship on 27 October. On 2 May 1950, she arrived at Birkenhead to commemorate {{the launch of the}} new carrier [...] the following day with the First Lord of the Admiralty, George Henry Hall, 1st Viscount Hall, aboard. A Hawker Sea Fury crashed while landing on 15 May, killing the pilot and two members of the deck crew. The prototype of the turboprop-powered Fairey Gannet antisubmarine plane made its first carrier landing aboard on 16 June. This event was also the first landing of any turboprop aircraft aboard an aircraft carrier.|$|E

[...] SuChin Pak, also from MTV stated the show was [...] "no huge revelation", explaining, [...] "It {{was not the kind of}} show that says: 'She's back. She's going to come out with the biggest album of her career.' Nor did it say that she's lost forever and we'll never see the old Britney back again. These are all really tiny baby steps." [...] Thomas K. Arnold of USA Today said the show [...] "turned out to be more rehearsal than comeback", although [...] "all those post-rehab workouts were worth the effort." [...] On May 2, 2007, scalpers outside the House of Blues in San Diego were selling tickets with a face value of $35 for prices between $200 and $500. Chris Lee of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "her 'comeback'– if you want to call it that– cemented Spears' place as pop music's reigning drama queen, capable of capturing worldwide tabloid headlines with a bare minimum of creative expenditure." ...|$|E

2500|$|Democratic {{candidates}} and political liberals have {{hidden from the}} word [...] "liberal", in some cases identifying instead with terms such as [...] "progressive" [...] or [...] "moderate". George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney accused their opponents of liberal elitism, softness, and pro-terrorism in attempts to frighten voters. Conservative political commentators such as Rush Limbaugh consistently used [...] "liberal" [...] as a pejorative label. When liberals shifted to the word [...] "progressive" [...] to describe their beliefs, conservative radio host Glenn Beck used [...] "progressive" [...] as an abusive label. Historian Godfrey Hodgson notes [...] "The word liberal itself has fallen into disrepute. Nothing is <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> conservative bloggers and columnists—let alone radio hosts—to say about liberals. Democrats themselves run {{a mile from the}} 'Lword' for fear of being seen as dangerously outside the mainstream. Conservative politicians and publicists, by dint of associating liberals with all manner of absurdity so that many sensible people hesitated to risk being tagged with the label of liberalism, succeeded in persuading the country that it was more conservative than it actually was." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 2008 {{presidential primary}} campaign, Romney had {{distinguished}} his prescription for {{the automotive industry}} from rival candidate John McCain's by calling for a five-fold increase, to $20 billion per year over five years, in federal funding {{for research and development}} in energy, fuel technology, materials science, and automotive technology. In a January 14 speech, he stated, “I’m not willing to sit back and say, ‘… <b>Too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> the people who’ve lost their jobs. They’re gone forever.’" [...] As the automotive industry crisis of 2008 arose amidst the near collapse of the private-sector credit market and banking industry in late 2008, Romney argued against a bailout with direct government loans of the auto industry. He proposed that struggling auto manufacturers should undergo managed bankruptcy, after which they should seek loans from the private-sector credit market with government-backed loan guarantees. Writing in an op-ed article published in the New York Times in November 2008 (his original title had been [...] "The Way Forward for the Auto Industry" [...] but the editors published the article under the title [...] "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt"), Romney said, [...] "If General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye." [...] In referring to his proposal for managed bankruptcy, he said [...] "t would permit the companies to shed excess labor, pension and real estate costs." [...] The Obama Administration ultimately implemented managed bankruptcy reorganizations of the General Motors and Chrysler corporations in combination with the direct government financing that Romney had opposed, after which Romney said that he deserved credit for the auto industry's recovery.|$|E
