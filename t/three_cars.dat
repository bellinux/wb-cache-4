5|$|Trains on {{the branch}} used tracks 10 through 12 at the Saint George Terminal. Trains {{originally}} {{consisted of two}} and <b>three</b> <b>cars</b> during the AM and PM rush hours, and one cars at other times; {{by the end of}} passenger service, trains used only one car.|$|E
5|$|Development of the Dive Coaster began between 1994 and 1995 with Oblivion at Alton Towers {{opening on}} March 14, 1998, {{making it the}} world's first Dive Coaster. The trains {{for this type of}} coaster are {{relatively}} short consisting of two to <b>three</b> <b>cars.</b> Bolliger & Mabillard have recently begun to also use floorless trains on this model to enhance the experience. As of May 2016, ten Dive Coasters have been built, with the newest being Valravn at Cedar Point.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{once again}} {{set the time}} in Q2, almost a second ahead of second-placed Kimi Räikkönen, while Felipe Massa went faster than Sebastian Vettel in third. Alonso was {{eliminated}} in 14th position, ahead of Max Verstappen in the Toro Rosso, who was half a second slower than Carlos Sainz Jr., his teammate. Sergio Pérez joined the two Sauber drivers as the last <b>three</b> <b>cars</b> not {{to make it into}} the top 10.|$|E
50|$|From the 1970s to 1989 {{the works}} {{manufactured}} much of British Rail's electric multiple unit passenger stock, including: Class 313 (64 <b>three</b> <b>car</b> trains, 1976/7); Class 314 (16 <b>three</b> <b>car</b> trains, 1979); Class 315 (61 four car, 1980/1); Class 317 (72 four car, 1981-2 & 1985-7); Class 319 (86 four car, 1987-1990); Class 318 (21 <b>three</b> <b>car,</b> 1984-1986);, Class 321 (117 four car, 1988-1991). and Class 455 (137 four car, 1982-4). The works continued producing vehicles for British Rail after privatisation.|$|R

5|$|Krake {{operates}} {{with three}} floorless steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has <b>three</b> <b>cars</b> that can seat six riders {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 18 riders per train. The seats are black and each have a brown over-the-shoulder restraint. On each train, there are a pair of tubes that allow the water to be shot into the air as the train reaches the bottom of the first drop. Also, the trains for the roller coaster were manufactured in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 2009, at 4:27am, two trains {{collided}} at the West Falls Church train yard. One train {{pulled in}} and collided {{into the back}} of the other train. No customers were aboard, and only minor injuries to the operators and cleaning staff were reported. However, <b>three</b> <b>cars</b> (1106, 1171, and 3216) were believed to be damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{versions}} of the T1000 stock have earlier been used on the Oslo metro. This includes 146 cars of the types T1 through T4, that have third-rail only operation, and thus did not run on the Holmenkollen and Kolsås lines. These ran usually in units of three or six (sometimes four or five) cars. Types T5 to T8, 49 in total, delivered with both third-rail and overhead wire equipment, normally ran on the Holmenkollen line (two cars) and Kolsås line (<b>three</b> <b>cars).</b>|$|E

5|$|During construction, which {{occurred}} during World War II, {{there were several}} modifications, delays and accidents during construction to avoid the trains being finished before the war ended; this was to avoid the finished trains {{to be able to}} assist the German occupation forces. The first three units were finished in 1945, and delivery was completed the following year. The class was originally numbered 106, but NSB changed the numbering system in 1956, and the class was renumbered to 66. The units consisted of <b>three</b> <b>cars,</b> given the lettering BFM, B and BS. They were numbered 66.01–04, 66.31–34 and 66.61–64, respectively; this numbering system dates from 1970.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool Data Research Associates (LDRA) {{were called}} in to {{investigate}} allegations of cheating using banned driving aids, such as traction control and launch control, both prohibited {{at the start of}} the year. The top <b>three</b> <b>cars</b> of Michael Schumacher, Nicola Larini and Mika Häkkinen were investigated and their teams were asked to surrender their systems' source code to the company. Larini's team, Ferrari, complied in light of allegations that they were cheating, but Schumacher and Häkkinen's teams, Benetton and McLaren refused, claiming copyright reasons. After being fined $100,000 by the FIA, both teams complied eight days after the race. LDRA discovered that McLaren were running a programme that permitted automatic gearshifts but the car was declared legal.|$|E
5|$|SMRT first {{attempted}} {{to install a}} passenger information system SMRTime on trains using LCD displays in 1999; these have since been removed. In November 2006 the doors of <b>three</b> <b>cars</b> (carriage number 3006, 1006 and 2006) were installed with a dynamic, in-train system displaying station information for testing; these are similar to ones used by Hong Kong's MTR. An initial prototype of STARIS based upon the existing Automatic Transit Info System was developed in-house; this was removed {{before the end of}} the year without entering service.|$|E

5|$|Ten French {{manufacturers}} entered {{cars in the}} Grand Prix: Clément-Bayard, Hotchkiss, Gobron-Brillié, Darracq, Vulpes, Brasier (the {{successor to}} Richard-Brasier), Panhard, Grégoire, Lorraine-Dietrich and Renault. Two teams came from Italy (FIAT and Itala) and one (Mercedes) from Germany. With the exceptions of Gobron-Brillié and Vulpes, which each entered one car, and Grégoire, which entered two cars, each team entered <b>three</b> <b>cars,</b> to make a total field of thirty-four entries. No British or American manufacturers entered the Grand Prix. The British were suspicious that the event was designed as propaganda for the French automobile industry; British magazine The Motor quoted French daily newspaper Le Petit Parisien as evidence of this supposed lack of sportsmanship.|$|E
5|$|After {{the train}} is {{dispatched}} and enters Wonder Mountain, riders {{find themselves in a}} graveyard where zombies are roaming. At the end of the scene, riders who began facing forward see a survivor directing them to the next scene. Riders who were seated backwards do not see this transition. The next scene takes place in a house overrun by the zombies and large spiders. At the end of the scene a truck crashes into the house. Riders then leave the house and pass the survivor; this transition is again absent for backward-seated riders. The train continues to a road with zombies, where <b>three</b> <b>cars</b> with zombies on them join the riders. Two of the cars crash {{at the end of the}} scene. The train then passes through a tunnel with abandoned cars; this scene is absent for riders facing backward. Riders then battle the zombies for the final time before entering the drop track sequence. The names of the highest-scoring riders are displayed on a leader-board for this version of the attraction.|$|E
5|$|In February 1953, Lympne was {{waterlogged}} {{and services}} were temporarily transferred to Southend. In September waterlogging again stopped the air ferry, which {{was transferred to}} RAF West Malling. Six Bristol Freighter Mk.32s were introduced in March 1953, {{at a cost of}} £540,000, which could each carry <b>three</b> <b>cars</b> and a service to Ostend was started with the aircraft. Skyways remained at Lympne until October 1954 when it moved to Lydd (Ferryfield). On 3 October 1954, the last Silver City flight to Le Touquet was operated by Bristol Freighter G-AIFV. Silver City moved to Lydd because the runway at Lympne was not suitable. Although it had campaigned for improvements to the runway and was Lympne's biggest customer the airfields owners, the Ministry of Civil Aviation, refused. Silver City said it would build an airport suitable for its needs at Lydd.|$|E

5|$|Nicolas Lapierre {{sustained}} a puncture {{on his car}} during the race's final lap, allowing Strakka Racing to inherit fourth place. Unhindered in the final 35 minutes Fässler was the first driver to finish the race, 47 seconds ahead of Jani in second place, and Kobayashi followed in third position in the No. 6 Toyota. Albuquerque maintained his advantage to take the victory in LMP2, earning him and Senna their first class victories in the World Endurance Championship and González's fourth in the series. They were followed by the No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorspors Ligier of Ryan Dalziel, Derani and Cumming 32 seconds later, with Rusinov, Nathanaël Berthon and Rast in the No. 26 G-Drive Racing Oreca completing the class podium with all <b>three</b> <b>cars</b> finishing on the same lap as each other. The No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari of Bird and Rigon were unchallenged throughout the race and clinched their first victory of the season, in front of teammates Bruni and Calado, with Turner, Nicki Thiim and Marco Sørensen in the No. 95 Aston Martin rounding out the LMGTE Pro podium positions. In LMGTE Am, François Perrodo, Emmanuel Collard and Agias led the final half hour to secure their team's first win {{of the year in}} the category with a one-lap advantage over Aston Martin's No. 95 entry of Paul Dalla Lana, Pedro Lamy and Mathias Lauda.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} Nato, Haryanto and Binder went {{three abreast}} at the Casino hairpin which saw Haryanto squeezed wide at the corner's exit by Nato and {{was unable to}} leave the turn, causing a brief usage of the VSC to allow the <b>three</b> <b>cars</b> to be extracted from the circuit by a trackside crane. Nato was able to continue but made a pit stop for repairs and was issued with a ten-second time penalty because he was judged to have caused the collision. The race resumed on the second lap with Stanaway leading Maricello and Sirotkin. Stanaway pulled away {{from the rest of the}} field. Leal was overtaken for fourth place by Canamasas at Sainte Dévote on the seventh lap's start and narrowly made the corner. Stanaway led the field by three seconds at the race's mid-way point while Maricello was two seconds in front of Sirotkin. Stanaway's team cautioned him about the possibility of his tyres degrading if he continued to push hard. Few overtaking manoeuvres took place as the field spread out. Rossi and Vandoorne intentionally fell back from the leaders and both drivers started to record fastest lap times in an effort of earning the accolade of one point for setting the event's fastest lap. Vandoorne temporarily claimed the award with a lap time of one minute and 21.926 seconds, before Nato gained the accolade on the 30th lap with a time of one minute and 21.886 seconds.|$|E
