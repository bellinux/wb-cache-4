500|$|Consumer Reports' {{analysis}} {{show that}} many Chevrolets lose {{about half of}} their purchase price {{after three years of}} ownership, and if the Volt depreciates the same, [...] seems a reasonable estimate. However, Consumer Reports have noted that fuel-efficient hybrids and diesel models often depreciate far less than most vehicles, which might increase the Volt's resale value after three years above the [...] estimate. Additionally, if gasoline prices continue to rise or if the tax credits expire, the demand for used Chevrolet Volts could quickly increase, raising their market value. On the other hand, if the next-generation Volt’s battery has twice the capacity and cost less, as General Motors has claimed, the first generation Volts will be obsolete when the new ones come out in 2015. Considering these assumptions, Consumer Reports considers that [...] "at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>we</b> believe it’s still unclear how the Volt will fare." ...|$|E

Parker said, [...] "At <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>we</b> just sort of wanted to do a Charlie Brown Christmas South Park version.

Matsui made some effort to restrain Yanagawa, but also told him that he could send some advance units beyond the line. In fact, Matsui was highly sympathetic with Yanagawa's actions and a few days later on November 22 Matsui issued an urgent telegram to the Army General Staff insisting that [...] "To resolve this crisis in a prompt manner we need {{to take advantage of the}} enemy's present declining fortunes and conquer Nanking ... By staying behind the operation restriction line at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>we</b> are not only letting our chance to advance slip by, but it is also having the effect of encouraging the enemy to replenish their fighting strength and recover their fighting spirit and there is a risk that it will become harder to completely break their will to make war." ...|$|E
