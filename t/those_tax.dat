The current tax-to-GDP ratio is 12.6% (2016), which is a little less than its {{neighbour}} India 16.6% (2016) [...] while a slight more than Sri Lanka 12.3% (2015). The pace of revenue mobilization has witnessed an upward trajectory since FY 2013. Overall revenues increased to 15.3 percent of GDP in FY 2016, compared to 13.3 percent of GDP recorded in FY 2013.

2500|$|McCain had {{declined}} to sign the pledge of the group Americans for Tax Reform to not add any new taxes or increase existing taxes. However, after he lost the presidential election in 2008, McCain became a signer of Americans for Tax Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge. In 2002, Sen. McCain {{was one of only}} two Republicans to twice vote against the permanent repeal of the Estate Tax, and has recently stated opposition to a permanent repeal of the Estate Tax. McCain was one of two Republicans who voted against Bush's tax cuts in 2001. He opposed accelerating the cuts in 2003, saying that he was not in favor of cutting taxes during a time of war. In 2004 McCain appeared on Meet The Press with Tim Russert where he was asked about his opposition to the Bush tax cuts. McCain explained himself by saying, [...] "I voted against the tax cuts because of the disproportional amount that went to the wealthiest Americans. I would clearly support not extending <b>those</b> <b>tax</b> cuts in order to help address the deficit." [...] However, McCain supported the Bush tax cut extension in May 2006, and January 2008 he told Russert that he favors making <b>those</b> <b>tax</b> cuts permanent to prevent an increase in taxes while the economy was [...] "shaky." [...] He also said that his tax proposal would focus more on middle-income Americans than on the wealthy.|$|E
2500|$|Stanton {{argued that}} the tax law was unconstitutional and void under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution in that the law denied [...] "to mining {{companies}} and their stockholders {{equal protection of the}} laws and deprive them of their property without due process of law". The Court rejected that argument. Stanton also {{argued that the}} Sixteenth Amendment [...] "authorizes only an exceptional direct income tax without apportionment, to which the tax in question does not conform" [...] and that therefore the income tax was [...] "not within the authority of that Amendment". The Court also rejected this argument. Thus, the U.S. Supreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of the income tax under the 1913 Act, contradicts <b>those</b> <b>tax</b> protesters arguments that the income tax is unconstitutional under either the Fifth Amendment or the Sixteenth Amendment.|$|E

2500|$|The Court {{had chosen}} a {{different}} approach to the Eleventh Amendment question. Rather than agree with Hogan that Ohio had waived sovereign immunity for its school districts through the statute that had created them, [...] "we prefer to address instead the question of whether such an entity had any Eleventh Amendment immunity in the first place, since if we conclude that it had none it will be unnecessary to reach the question of waiver," [...] Rehnquist wrote. Ohio law itself was very clear—the state did not include local [...] "political subdivisions" [...] and the school district was a political subdivision. While it received guidance and some money from the state Department of Education, it was one of many local school districts in the state and had broad authority to levy property taxes and issue bonds financed by <b>those</b> <b>tax</b> revenues. [...] "On balance, the record before us indicates that a local school board such as petitioner is more like a county or city than it is like an arm of the state ... it was not entitled to assert any Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in the federal courts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Obama's {{presidency}} saw {{an extended}} battle over taxes that {{ultimately led to}} the permanent extension {{of most of the}} Bush tax cuts. <b>Those</b> <b>tax</b> cuts were set to expire during Obama's presidency since they were originally passed using a Congressional maneuver known as reconciliation, and had to fulfill the long-term deficit requirements of the [...] "Byrd rule." [...] During the lame duck session of the 111th Congress, Obama and Republicans wrangled over the ultimate fate of the cuts. Obama wanted to extend the tax cuts for taxpayers making less than $250,000 a year, while Congressional Republicans wanted a total extension of the tax cuts, and refused to support any bill that did not extend tax cuts for top earners. Obama and the Republican Congressional leadership reached a deal that included a two-year extension of all the tax cuts, a 13-month extension of unemployment insurance, a one-year reduction in the FICA payroll tax, and other measures. Obama ultimately persuaded many wary Democrats to support the bill, though many liberals such as Bernie Sanders continued to oppose it. The $858 billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress and was signed into law by Obama on December 17, 2010.|$|E
