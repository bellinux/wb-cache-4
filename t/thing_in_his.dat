A special mass culminates the occasion, reinforcing its spiritual nature to the people of Aliaga.|$|E
25|$|The series fleshes out Scrooge's {{upbringing}} by depicting {{his life}} as an individual who worked hard his entire life to earn his keep and to fiercely defend it against those who were truly dishonest, But also, he defend {{his family and friends}} from any dangers,including villains. His value teaches his nephews not to be dishonest with him or anybody else. It is shown that money is no longer the most important <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life. For one episode he was under a love spell, which caused him to lavish his time on a goddess, over everything else. The nephews find out {{that the only way to}} break the spell is make the person realize that the object of their love will cost them something they truly love. The boys make it appear that Scrooge's love is allergic to money; however, he simply decides to give up his wealth so he can be with her. Later, when he realizes he will have to give up his nephews to be with her, the spell is immediately broken, showing that family is the most important thing to him.|$|E

500|$|John Fordham of The Guardian {{called the}} album a [...] "return to a funk {{repertoire}} reminiscent of Clarke's roots in Chick Corea electric bands". He {{goes on to}} call it [...] "more than just a box-ticking piece of jazz-funk commercialism" [...] but laments [...] "Clarke could probably {{play a lot of}} this kind of <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> sleep". William R. Wood wrote in the Kalamazoo Gazette that [...] "Clarke’s complex bass work is invigorating as he blends jazz, rock and funk".|$|E
500|$|Edward Gross {{described}} Roddenberry's {{rejection of}} The Final Frontier as [...] "ironic" [...] {{because of the}} similarity between that film and The God <b>Thing.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> book, Jewish Themes in Star Trek, Rabbi Yonassan Gershom compared the two plots, saying they were different in their approaches. He said Roddenberry wanted to disprove God's existence in The God Thing, whereas William Shatner, who directed The Final Frontier, sought to take God seriously. This was {{partly due to the}} novelization of The Final Frontier, in which the original version of the scene was to show all manner of religious expression on the final showdown with the God-like figure in Sha-Ka-Ree. However, this scene was simplified for the film.|$|E
500|$|With Morton, the New York Dolls {{recorded}} Too Much Too Soon in 1974 at A Studios in New York City. The {{album was}} later mastered at Sterling Sound and Masterdisk. During the sessions, Morton had Johansen record his vocals {{several times and}} incorporated sound effects such as gongs, gunshots, and feminine choruses. In {{a report on the}} album's progress for Melody Maker, journalist Lenny Kaye wrote that they were taking more time than they had on their first record, [...] "bringing in occasional strings and horns, following Shadow's advice not 'to settle'." [...] Morton and the band shared an affinity for each other, as he found the group's energy in the studio refreshing, while Johansen was fond of Morton and the [...] "looser" [...] feel he provided for their music: [...] "That man is completely unpretentious. He doesn't think he ever did a marvellous <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life." ...|$|E

500|$|Stewie and Bertram, Stewie says [...] "On my signal, unleash hell." [...] This is a {{reference}} to the opening scene of Gladiator. An Ice Age reference is made when Scrat, a character from the films, attempts to steal Peter's nuts. When Stewie invades Bertram's camp {{at the end of the}} episode Bertram quotes , repeating the line Darth Vader says when he senses Obi-Wan Kenobi on the Death Star. [...] When Peter names his kids, Peter mentions the kids from various shows that are currently airing at Nick at Nite. [...] When Brian mentions this, Peter begins naming Street Fighter characters. [...] Brian again points out this fact, after which Peter names various colors. [...] Sauron, the villain from The Lord of the Rings is shown as the Eye of Sauron in a scene where he is trying to find his lost contact lens. [...] A cutaway scene features Peter in a jail surrounded by inmates who force him to strip, squeeze his boobs together, and sing the chorus from Kelis's 2003 hit “Milkshake.” This is possibly an homage to the scene after the credits in the movie [...] in which Ben Stiller does the same <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> fatsuit.|$|E
500|$|Four {{days after}} Kesler's return, Jannik Hansen was {{involved}} in a controversial hit on the Chicago Blackhawks' Marian Hossa. As both players went up for an airborne puck, Hansen struck Hossa {{in the back of the}} head with his forearm and elbow. Hossa then laid on the ice for a few minutes, during which time the training staff examined him before he was able to leave under his own power. Hansen was given a two-minute minor for roughing and Hossa did not return to the game. Opinions of the hit varied with former NHL referee Kerry Fraser, stating that he did not believe that there was any deliberate or malicious intent, and that he would be surprised if Hansen received a suspension for the play. Meanwhile, former Blackhawks analyst Ed Olczyk stated, [...] "there’s no doubt in my mind, once he didn’t play the puck, he had one <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mind, and that was to put his forearm or elbow in the back of the head of Marian Hossa," [...] and he would be surprised if Hansen was not suspended. Hossa returned to practice the following day. Hansen was suspended for one game due to what Brendan Shanahan called [...] "the carelessness and force of which the blow was delivered." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} that Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan would also be featured on the song, who West had invited to Hawaii. Raekwon initially {{had no interest in}} working with West musically, and originally only went to Hawaii to share some insight with him. According to the rapper, a lot of artists in the music industry refuse to be honest and give genuine advice because they don't want to help their competition, comparing the mentality to a group of crabs in a barrel. One of the reasons for Raekwon's desire to give West advice was because the frontman of the Wu-Tang Clan, RZA, spoke positively of West. RZA stated that West embodied the mentality of the Wu-Tang Clan, and praised his skills as a producer. RZA {{was a part of the}} recording sessions for the album in Hawaii, and contributed to the production of songs [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and [...] "So Appalled". Eventually after being impressed by West himself, Raekwon decided to collaborate with West on several tracks, including [...] "Gorgeous". Raekwon described West as a hard worker, and stated that the [...] "first thing I can tell you about Kanye West is that he's a hard worker. When you look at him, you can tell that he still has that whole hip-hop <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bones." ...|$|E

2500|$|D. S. Mirsky called Maykov [...] "the most {{representative}} poet of the age," [...] but added: [...] "Maykov was mildly 'poetical' and mildly realistic; mildly tendentious, {{and never}} emotional. Images {{are always the}} principal <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> poems. Some of them (always subject to the restriction {{that he had no}} style and no diction) are happy discoveries, like the short and very well known poems on spring and rain. But his more realistic poems are spoiled by sentimentality, and his more 'poetic' poems hopelessly inadequate — their beauty is mere mid-Victorian tinsel. Few of his more ambitious attempts are successful." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 23, at 11:24am EDT, a cable, {{drafted by}} George Wildman Ball to the US Ambassador in Turkey and NATO, {{notified}} {{them that they}} were considering making an offer to withdraw what the US knew to be nearly-obsolete missiles from Italy and Turkey, in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal from Cuba. Turkish officials replied that they would [...] "deeply resent" [...] any trade involving the US's missile presence in their country. Two days later, on the morning of October 25, US journalist Walter Lippmann proposed the same <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> syndicated column. Castro reaffirmed Cuba's right to self-defense and said that all of its weapons were defensive and Cuba would not allow an inspection.|$|E
2500|$|Wherever he was, in {{his lectures}} and {{activities}} he conveyed to his audience his simple philosophy of life: man {{as an individual}} is the most precious <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own environment, regardless of descent or education. (This is most clearly expressed in his work [...] "Kumeŭaŭa".) Man as a cultural capital {{is the product of}} all humanity, because in our daily lives we interact with products invented by diverse people; he illustrated this with a dining table, explaining that each piece of tableware was invented by a different people, each of the foods that had been developed and planted by different people, and now ten cultures are involved in setting a table. Therefore, every man was a respectable person, and what we have today is the result of efforts of all nations, and therefore belongs to all.|$|E
2500|$|Lacking the {{business}} focus of Albert Weber Sr., {{but not his}} energy and zest for life, Weber Jr. was also known {{as something of a}} hothead and even spent a night in jail for assault. [...] This 1896 assault charge, when Weber Jr. was 38 years old, gives some insight into his character, with the magistrate remarking [...] "You had no right to call this man names, and you also had no right to flourish a loaded revolver in that dangerous manner. [...] I fine you $5." [...] Unfortunately for Weber, the only <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> pockets was a bean shooter, so he spent the night in jail as he failed to produce the necessary $5. [...] This incident occurred at the Weber Company's showrooms on Fifth Avenue in September 1896. [...] Only a few weeks later, Weber had a mental breakdown that required he be taken to Bellevue Hospital's insane pavilion, although this may have been an attempt to escape from his creditors.|$|E

2500|$|So in {{love with}} praise, both popular and in the highest circles, is Wilberforce, observes Hazlitt, that he was even half {{inclined}} {{to give up his}} favorite cause, abolition of the slave trade, when William Pitt, the Prime Minister, was set to abandon it, and he sided with Pitt in approval of the repressive measures then imposed by the government in Britain and the government's later severe measures during the period of the Napoleonic Wars and afterward. [...] "He has no mercy on those who claim a property in negro-slaves as so much live-stock on their estates ... but not a word has he to say, not a whisper does he breathe against the claim set up by the Despots of the Earth over their Continental subjects, but does every <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> power to confirm and sanction it! He must give no offence. ... He preaches vital Christianity to untutored savages; and tolerates its worst abuses in civilized states." [...] To [...] "render signal services to mankind" [...] requires greater moral strength than Wilberforce possesses: what is needed is [...] "a severity, a sternness, a self-denial, and a painful sense of duty" [...] that in Wilberforce's case vanish in exchange for a nod of approval from the king or the Prime Minister. Even in Wilberforce's acts of independence from his party's political standpoint, Hazlitt notes a subtle balancing of motives. In the words of Wilberforce biographer William Hague, who quotes Hazlitt's Spirit of the Age criticism, [...] "Hazlitt considered that Wilberforce meant well, but would never risk becoming unpopular with the ruling establishment: 'He ... reaps the credit of independence without the obloquy ... He has all the air of the most perfect independence, and gains a character for impartiality and candour, when he is only striking a balance between the éclat of differing from a Minister on some vantage ground, and the risk or odium that may attend it.|$|E
