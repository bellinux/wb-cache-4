500|$|In 2001, AI founder Marvin Minsky asked [...] "So <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> didn't we get HAL in 2001?" [...] Minsky {{believed}} {{that the answer is}} that the central problems, like commonsense reasoning, were being neglected, while most researchers pursued things like commercial applications of neural nets or genetic algorithms. John McCarthy, on the other hand, still blamed the qualification problem. For Ray Kurzweil, the issue is computer power and, using Moore's Law, he predicted that machines with human-level intelligence will appear by 2029. Jeff Hawkins argued that neural net research ignores the essential properties of the human cortex, preferring simple models that have been successful at solving simple problems. There were many other explanations and for each there was a corresponding research program underway.|$|E

"Given these {{judgments}} of the Soviet future made by {{political leaders and}} journalists, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> were they right {{and so many of}} our Sovietological colleagues wrong. The answer again in part must be ideological. Reagan and Levin came from rightist backgrounds, and Moynihan, much like the leaders of the AFL-CIO, from a leftist anti-Stalinist social-democratic milieu, environments that disposed participants to believe the worst. Most of the Sovietologists, on the other hand, were left-liberal in their politics, an orientation that undermined their capacity to accept the view that economic statism, planning, socialist incentives, would not work. They were also for the most part ignorant of, or ignored, the basic Marxist formulation {{that it is impossible to}} build socialism in impoverished societies." ...|$|E

In this verse he does not use the same spelling he did previously, thus also linking to the Old Testament figure Judah.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> {{would people}} use {{religious}} attributions anyway. This question {{takes us to}} a few very basic motivational themes that underlie much religious thinking and behavior—namely, the human need for meaning, control and esteem. [...] The nature of people makes us [...] "need to know" [...] things, and we have need for control and mastery of our lives. This is where need for control and meaning play in. But why esteem? Research suggests that people assign causality {{in order to maintain}} and enhance their self-esteem. Attributions are triggered when meanings are unclear; and when meaning is unclear control is unclear and self-esteem is challenged.|$|E
50|$|Now <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> {{are this}} pneumatophores even form when the shoot {{of all these}} plants have {{arrangements}} to respirate quite efficiently? The {{answer to this question}} is that the soil on which this halophytic plants grow are saline and largely anaerobic. It is important to mention here that even in other plants the gaseous exchange that is done at leaves is of minimal work for roots which are a lot far away. So roots absorb their own, dissolved, oxygen from the soil. However, since saline soil is largely anaerobic it becomes impossible for the roots to do gaseous exchange through soil and hence form pneumatophores that can absorb oxygen directly from air.|$|E
