5|$|On 30 March 1999, the Council met to {{initiate}} {{planning for a}} centre to house the visual and performing arts at the former Civic Centre site in the Port Macquarie central business district. It recommended a project plan be developed by 2001. On 21 August 2000 a Cultural Facilities Taskforce was created. In December 2000, the Council approached {{the management of the}} neighbouring shopping centre, Port Central, about a possible joint venture on the site, and the Council endorsed further negotiations on 28 May 2001. The joint venture was expected to cost around A$13.5 million, with the Council contributing A$7.3 million. The joint venture collapsed in August 2002 because the Council was not prepared to accommodate the needs of their commercial partner to make the project viable, and decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>it</b> alone. The new centre became an icon building {{under the direction of the}} Council's General Manager, managed by a Project Control group including the Mayor and Deputy Mayor. The costs blew out considerably by 28 June 2004, when the Council unanimously backed the project, outlays had already reached A$15A$20 million, and by late 2007 they had reached A$41.7 million. This was due to a range of factors including, that the Council bought and demolished neighbouring shops to make the facility big enough to include meeting rooms and conference facilities, and a drain built by convicts in the 19th century, and still in remarkably good condition, was discovered by archaeologists and needed to be preserved.|$|E

By 1820 Leavitt & Lee had moved to 127 Front Street, and shortly afterwards the two partners dissolved their business. Leavitt left the grocery business and decided to set himself up as a financier.

He struggled {{for most of the}} race, and was at points a half-lap down, only catching back up to the pack through a caution. The win was controversial because with 5 laps <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>it</b> appeared that Earnhardt went below the yellow line to gain position, but NASCAR ruled that Matt Kenseth had forced him below the line, making it a clean pass.|$|E

25|$|When Murphy {{began his}} career as a federal {{attorney}} the workload of the attorney's office was increasing at a rapid rate, mainly because of the number of prosecutions resulting from the enforcement of national prohibition. The government's excellent record in winning convictions in the Eastern District was partially due to Murphy's record of winning all but one of the cases he prosecuted. He practiced law privately to a limited extent while still a federal attorney, and resigned his position as a United States attorney on March 1, 1922. He had several offers to join private practices, but decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>it</b> alone and formed a partnership with Edward G. Kemp in Detroit.|$|E
25|$|With the Connecticut Huskies {{trailing}} by 8 {{points with}} less than 3 minutes <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>it</b> {{looked as if the}} Duke Blue Devils were going to spoil Jim Calhoun's chance at a second national title. Connecticut's All-American center Emeka Okafor was limited to just 22 minutes because of early foul trouble, but he came up clutch with several big plays down the stretch and finished with 18 points and only 3 fouls. By contrast, all three of Duke's centers fouled out, including Shelden Williams, who committed his fifth foul with 3:04 to play. In addition, Duke went without a field goal for the last 4½ minutes until Chris Duhon's meaningless three-pointer at the buzzer. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski was denied his 65th NCAA Tournament victory which would have tied him with Dean Smith for the all-time record. He later broke that record.|$|E
25|$|The top 10 drivers {{set their}} early quick laps. Hamilton took the early lead with Vettel and Rosberg close behind. With only two minutes <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>it</b> {{looked to be}} a close to who would take pole position. The top three were {{unchanged}} with Vettel very quick on track while Rosberg was going even quicker. However, Barrichello spun off and hit the wall hard, destroying much of {{the left side of his}} car, which brought out the yellow flags meaning anyone who was on a flying lap had to slow down unless they had already passed the scene of the accident. The red flag was brought out with 26 seconds remaining on the clock. As no other cars crossed the line, Hamilton took pole position ahead of Vettel, Rosberg and Mark Webber. Although Barrichello qualified fifth, he started the race tenth after his gearbox change. The session was restarted with only 26 seconds left there was no time to start a flying lap so no one rejoined the circuit. This session was the third of four to be red flagged during the weekend, only the third practice session was not interrupted.|$|E

[...] Unbeknownst to him, John Lennon and Paul McCartney {{were watching the}} live broadcast at John's apartment at The Dakota in New York at the time, which was {{within walking distance of}} the studio where the show was being shot. [...] The two men entertained the idea of hailing a cab to the studio and surprising Michaels by accepting his offer, but ultimately declined, for as Paul later said [...] "It would have been work, and we were having a night off, so we elected not <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>It</b> was a nice idea – we nearly did it." ...|$|E
500|$|Montoya {{admitted}} to feeling disappointed after the race, having been leading until his only pit stop on lap 22. He stated: [...] "I am so disappointed I cannot {{find the words}} to describe how I feel. Up to the pit stop the race was going perfectly for me." [...] Williams technical director Patrick Head was {{not happy with the}} refulling rigs supplied by the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). One of the rigs was sent back to manufacturer Intertechnique who said they could not find any issues with the system. Michael Schumacher, placed fourth before his retirement from a fuel pressure problem on lap 23, shared similar feelings to Montoya: [...] "I am not too disappointed as the situation in the championship remains the same and there is one less race <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>It</b> was a shame not to finish the race and pick up a further six points." ...|$|E

The announcement was made public on April 23, 2015, just a few hours before the airing of [...] "How to Save a Life". In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Dempsey explained how the decision could have been made when he had just renewed his contract as he asserted on the natural developments leading up to his exit from the long-running series. He said, [...] "It really was something that was kind of surprising that unfolded, and it just naturally came to be. Which was pretty good. I like the way it has all played out." [...] He went on to share further details on his character being written out of the show, as he said, [...] "Things happened very quickly, where we were like, Oh this is where it’s going <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>It</b> just sort of unfolded in a very organic way." [...] The developments leading up to the eventual exit which he deemed [...] "natural", began in February–March 2016.|$|E

He had traveled to the New York recording studio from Washington D.C. after a long night of partying. Gaga {{was already in the}} studio in her exuberant style with a big ribbon atop her head by which Wale was taken aback, and was a [...] "cultural difference" [...] for him. In an effort to warm up to each other they made small talk about their respective record deals with Interscope.

Once we finally got the ball rolling, it was almost time <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>It</b> was natural though.
