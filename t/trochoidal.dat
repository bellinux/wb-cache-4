Even before Airy's linear theory, Gerstner derived a nonlinear <b>trochoidal</b> wave theory in 1802, which however is not irrotational.|$|E

After JTWC downgraded Jangmi to a typhoon, it made landfall over Nan'ao in Yilan, Taiwan at 15:40 TST (07:40 UTC) with ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 100 knots (185 km/h, 115 mph) and an atmospheric pressure of [...] Because of the frictional effects of land, the typhoon showed <b>trochoidal</b> motion overland, unexpectedly shifting toward the south-southwest shortly. Jangmi weakened significantly by the mountainous terrain of Taiwan after landfall; therefore, it lost {{the majority of}} deep convection. Under the steering influence by the eastern subtropical ridge, the system began to track northward toward a break situated east of Shanghai, China, and it arrived at the Taiwan Strait from Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City) at 04:20 TST on September 29 (20:20 UTC on September 28).|$|E

50|$|The {{flow field}} {{associated}} with the <b>trochoidal</b> wave is not irrotational: it has vorticity. The vorticity is of such a specific strength and vertical distribution that the trajectories of the fluid parcels are closed circles. This is {{in contrast with the}} usual experimental observation of Stokes drift {{associated with the}} wave motion. Also the phase speed is independent of the <b>trochoidal</b> wave's amplitude, unlike other nonlinear wave-theories (like those of the Stokes wave and cnoidal wave) and observations. For these reasons - {{as well as for the}} fact that solutions for finite fluid depth are lacking - <b>trochoidal</b> waves are of limited use for engineering applications.|$|E
50|$|A prolate <b>trochoidal</b> mass {{spectrometer}} is an chemical analysis instrument {{in which the}} ions of different mass-to-charge ratio are separated by means of mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields so that the ions follow a prolate <b>trochoidal</b> path.

Assignment to the genus Globigerina was based on the globular to ovate chambers and <b>trochoidal</b> coiling, however true Globigerina is limited to the Cenozoic.

50|$|Ceratitids {{overwhelmingly}} produced planospirally coiled discoidal shells {{that may}} be evolute with inner whorls exposed or involute with only the outer whorl showing. In a few later forms the shell became subglobular, in others, <b>trochoidal</b> or uncoiled. Sutures are typically ceratitic, with smooth saddles and serrate or digitized lobes.

50|$|Aethoceras is a genus of Tarphycerida nautiloids {{included}} in the family Estonioceratidae for which the shell is a loosely coiled, gradually expanding dextral torticone with a slightly derpressed whorl section.

50|$|In fluid dynamics, a <b>trochoidal</b> wave or Gerstner wave is {{an exact}} {{solution}} of the Euler equations for periodic surface gravity waves. It describes a progressive wave of permanent form {{on the surface of}} an incompressible fluid of infinite depth. The free surface of this wave solution is an inverted (upside-down) trochoid - with sharper crests and flat troughs. This wave solution was discovered by Gerstner in 1802, and rediscovered independently by Rankine in 1863.|$|E
50|$|In linear plane {{waves of}} one {{wavelength}} in deep water, parcels {{near the surface}} move not plainly up and down but in circular orbits: forward above and backward below (compared the wave propagation direction). As a result, {{the surface of the}} water forms not an exact sine wave, but more a trochoid with the sharper curves upwards—as modeled in <b>trochoidal</b> wave theory. Wind waves are thus a combination of transversal and longitudinal waves.|$|E

Its fairing, designed in a wind tunnel at University of Stuttgart (then Stuttgart Technical College), gave it a drag coefficient of 0.19. The same engine powered Herz to a 1951 world speed record, with a less efficient frame/fairing, the Delphin I. The engine used an unusual rotary supercharger related to NSU's eventual development of the Wankel engine. In the supercharger, both a <b>trochoidal</b> inner rotor and epitrochoidal outer rotor spun around a stationary shaft.|$|E

The peristome is continuous. It is slightly thickened at the base around the umbilicus. Around the umbilicus, likewise, a third keel, crenulate, and not so acute, revolves.The dark red-brown operculum is multispiral with a not quite central nucleus.

50|$|Neoconorbina is a genus {{of recent}} (Holocene) discorbacean foraminifers related to Rosalina {{with a low}} conical <b>trochoidal</b> test, {{circular}} in outline.

The umbilical side is flat to concave. exposing only the three to four chambers of the final whorl around an open umbilicus. Chambers on the umbilical side have triangular to platelike umbilical extensions as with other rasalinids. The wall of is calcite, finely and densely perforate on the spiral side, more coarsely perforate on the umbilical side; surface smooth; aperture at the umbilical margin of the chamber, beneath the platelike extension, or folium.|$|E
50|$|The {{face milling}} process can in {{principle}} produce very flat surfaces. However, in practice the result always shows visible <b>trochoidal</b> marks following {{the motion of}} points on the cutter's end face. These revolution marks give the characteristic finish of a face milled surface. Revolution marks can have significant roughness depending on factors such as flatness of the cutter's end face {{and the degree of}} perpendicularity between the cutter's rotation axis and feed direction. Often a final pass with a slow feed rate is used to improve the surface finish after the bulk of the material has been removed.. In a precise face milling operation, the revolution marks will only be microscopic scratches due to imperfections in the cutting edge.|$|E
