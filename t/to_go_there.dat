5|$|After the 1972Summer Games, Brundage {{retired as}} IOC president. Accounts of Brundage's {{state of mind}} in his {{retirement}} differ. IOC director Berlioux stated that Brundage {{would come to the}} Château de Vidy and take telephone calls or look at correspondence, waiting for Lord Killanin to turn to him for help. According to Berlioux, Brundage sometimes called her from Geneva and asked her <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there.</b> The two would spend hours wandering the streets, saying little. Brundage's longtime , Frederick Ruegsegger, described a different, tranquil, Brundage, whom he compared to an abdicated Japanese emperor.|$|E
5|$|Like {{his father}} before him, Alec Waugh {{went to school}} at Sherborne, and, it was presumed by the family that Evelyn would follow, but in 1915, the school asked Alec to leave, after a {{homosexual}} relationship came to light. Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an officer, and, while awaiting confirmation of his commission, wrote The Loom of Youth (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne. The public sensation caused by Alec's novel so offended the school that it became impossible for Evelyn <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there.</b> In May 1917, much to his annoyance, {{he was sent to}} Lancing College, in his opinion, a decidedly inferior school.|$|E
5|$|Parker's fleet had an {{extremely}} difficult crossing. Battered by storms and high seas, the first ships {{of the fleet}} did not arrive at Cape Fear until April 18, and Cornwallis did not arrive until May 3. After several weeks there, in which the British troops raided Patriot properties, Clinton, Cornwallis and Parker concluded that Cape Fear was not a suitable base for further operations. Parker had sent out some ships on scouting expeditions {{up and down the}} coast, and reports on the partially finished condition of the Charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the operation of Mountain Grove Campground, the majority of people traveling there were worshipers. In the 1870s and 1880s, the campground was one of the three largest camp meeting sites that residents of Columbia County attended. In 1875, approximately 2500 people attended the camp meeting. In 1881, it was decided that all the profit generated from the campground would be dedicated to expansion and improvement of it. In 1891, the duration of the camp meeting was increased from seven to thirteen days. However, some people traveled there for a vacation. Within 20 years of the campground's opening, {{the majority of the people}} going there were there for a vacation, and trains carried bands and other entertainment-related items to the campground. However, people still continued <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> in large numbers for camp meeting. Local newspapers also began to advertise the campground as a resort instead of a camp meeting site. This began with an advertisement written by John R. Rote, secretary of the Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association, in the Columbia County Republican on July 9, 1891.|$|E
5|$|Jordan persuaded Hill to {{at least}} stay for the British Grand Prix. Going into that race weekend, Hill {{announced}} he would retire after the Grand Prix, leading Jordan to test Jos Verstappen in case Hill had to be quickly replaced. Following a strong fifth place at his home event, however, Hill {{changed his mind and}} decided to see out the year. His best result {{for the remainder of the}} season was sixth place, which he achieved in both Hungary and Belgium. With three races of 1999 <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>there</b> were rumours that the Prost Grand Prix team would release Jarno Trulli early after he signed for Jordan's 2000 campaign as Hill's replacement. At the same time, his teammate, Frentzen, became a title contender going into the final few races of the season and, eventually, finished third in the championship. In so doing, both Hill and Frentzen helped Jordan to achieve its best-ever finish with a third position in the constructor's championship. Hill's last race was the Japanese Grand Prix where he spun off the track and pulled into the pits citing mental fatigue.|$|E

A correction was put onto the Nevada GOP website that morning, {{two days before the}} caucuses. Then Paul's campaign criticized inconsistencies, confusion over rules, and a shortage of ballots in some counties. They asked the state Republican Party to consider postponing the vote because of those problems and others, such as unclear rules on who could vote.|$|E

Upon receiving his leaving certificate, he was awarded a scholarship to study at the Sydney Technical College; {{but as part of}} the Combined Schools team, he played rugby against the Royal Military College, Duntroon, which had moved from Canberra to the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, due to the Great Depression, and decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> instead.

25|$|At Stellenbosch Du Plessis was {{initially}} {{more interested in}} cricket than rugby; he had chosen <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> because of his desire {{to play in the}} university cricket team. In 1971 his prowess at cricket earned him selection to the South African Universities cricket side, and then to the Western Province team during that same year. Playing five first-class cricket matches as a right-arm medium pace bowler, he took 16 wickets at an average of 25.62 runs per wicket, and turned in a best performance of 4 wickets for 71 runs. But when Barry Richards, opening batsman of the South African and of the Natal cricket sides, hit Du Plessis for two sixes in the final over before lunch during a Castle Cup match between Western Province and Natal, he decided that perhaps he should rather concentrate on rugby.|$|E
25|$|Jason Fleming (voiced by Nolan North) and his {{new girlfriend}} Claire (voiced by Eliza Jane Schneider) are backpacking in the Olympic Mountains when they come across some caverns.

He comes across a massive {{underground}} complex manned by numerous soldiers with high-end technology. He manages to follow men dragging Claire through the complex {{and is able to}} rescue her. However, both have heard discussion among the soldiers about their group, the Progressive Restoration, which appears to be ready to launch attacks across the United States. Jason escorts Claire to the entrance to allow her to contact authorities, while he uses stolen high-tech devices to further infiltrate the complex and learn more.|$|E
25|$|After the Battle of Bailen and the {{subsequent}} French surrender on 21 July 1808, the myth of French military invincibility was exploded. In the sequel, King Joseph Bonaparte withdrew the remaining Imperial French forces behind the Ebro River. Determined to conquer Spain, Napoleon resolved <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> himself with a large army. He ordered three army corps to march from Germany to reinforce Joseph's badly shaken survivors. Among other reinforcements, one light cavalry and five dragoon divisions were transferred to Spain {{under the command of}} Victor de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg, Milhaud, Armand Lebrun de La Houssaye, Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge, Jacques Louis François Milet and Jean Baptiste Marie Franceschi-Delonne. La Tour-Maubourg led the 1st Dragoon Division with 3,695 troopers, Milhaud the 2nd with 2,940, Houssaye the 3rd with 2,020, Lorge the 4th with 3,101, and Milet the 5th with 2,903. Franceschi led the 2,400-man light cavalry division. Two of Milhaud's regiments were assigned to other units and Milet was soon replaced by Kellermann. On 9 November 1808, Marshal Bessières was replaced by Marshal Nicolas Soult in charge of the II Corps and ordered to lead the Cavalry Reserve. However, the Cavalry Reserve was not destined to remain intact. In December, Franceschi was already assigned to Soult, Houssaye and Lorge were directed to join Soult, and Milet was still on the march to Spain. Meanwhile, La Tour-Maubourg and Milhaud were assigned to help defend Madrid. Bessières remained with the cavalry near Madrid. Meanwhile, the French won the Battle of Tudela on 23 November 1808. Alexandre, vicomte Digeon participated in this combat with two regiments of La Tour-Maubourg's division, 1,200 strong. While Marshal Jean Lannes and the Imperial infantry put the Spanish center and right wing to flight, Digeon's and a second brigade of French cavalry immobilized 10,000 soldiers of the Spanish left wing.|$|E
