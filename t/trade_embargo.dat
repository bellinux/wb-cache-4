We show that sustaining e¢ cient trade implied an ability of the guilds to restrict their membership but no internal enforcement mechanism was necessary. Our reformulation of the guilds´ strategies - based on the historical evidence - makes <b>trade</b> <b>embargoes</b> self-enforcing and allows us to provide a richer picture of how the guilds could have facilitated trade expansion by controlling merchant trading activities. ...|$|R
5|$|It {{appears that}} after this first wave of {{destruction}} a short-lived revival of Mycenaean culture followed. Mycenaean Greece continues to be mentioned in international affairs, particularly in Hittite records. In c. 1220 BC, the king of Ahhiyawa is again reported to {{have been involved in}} an anti-Hittite uprising in western Anatolia. Another contemporary Hittite account reports that Ahhiyawan ships should avoid Assyrian-controlled harbors, as part of a <b>trade</b> <b>embargo</b> imposed on Assyria. In general, {{in the second half of}} 13th century BC, trade was in decline in the Eastern Mediterranean, most probably due to the unstable political environment there.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shipments}} {{took place}} in 1806 when Tudor transported an initial trial cargo of ice, probably harvested from his family estate at Rockwood, to the Caribbean island of Martinique. Sales were hampered, however, {{by the lack of}} local storage facilities, both for Tudor's stock and any ice bought by domestic customers, and as a result the ice stocks quickly melted away. Learning from this experience, Tudor then built a functioning ice depot in Havana and, despite the U.S. <b>trade</b> <b>embargo</b> declared in 1807, was trading successfully again by 1810. He was unable to acquire exclusive legal rights to import ice into Cuba, but was nonetheless able to maintain an effective monopoly through his control of the ice houses. The 1812 war briefly disrupted trade, but over subsequent years Tudor began to export fruit back from Havana to the mainland on the return journey, kept fresh with part of the unsold ice cargo. Trade to Charleston and to Savannah in Georgia followed, while Tudor's competitors began to supply South Carolina and Georgia by ship from New York or using barges sent downstream from Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of China proper, the nomadic Xiongnu {{chieftain}} Modu Chanyu (r.209–174 BC) conquered various tribes inhabiting the eastern portion of the Eurasian Steppe. By {{the end of his}} reign, he controlled Manchuria, Mongolia, and the Tarim Basin, subjugating over twenty states east of Samarkand. Emperor Gaozu was troubled about the abundant Han-manufactured iron weapons traded to the Xiongnu along the northern borders, and he established a <b>trade</b> <b>embargo</b> against the group. Although the embargo was in place, the Xiongnu found traders willing to supply their needs. Chinese forces also mounted surprise attacks against Xiongnu who traded at the border markets. In retaliation, the Xiongnu invaded what is now Shanxi province, where they defeated the Han forces at Baideng in 200 BC. After negotiations, the heqin agreement in 198 BC nominally held the leaders of the Xiongnu and the Han as equal partners in a royal marriage alliance, but the Han were forced to send large amounts of tribute items such as silk clothes, food, and wine to the Xiongnu.|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{the world}} meat trade is {{undergoing}} substantial changes {{as a consequence}} of the spread of transboundary animal diseases. These diseases have resulted in the implementation of <b>trade</b> <b>embargoes</b> applied nation-wide against infected countries, contrary to the principle of regionalization. This principle allows a country to declare part of its territory free from a given disease even though there have been outbreaks in other regions thus averting the need to suspend all exports. Its application consists in the formal recognition that a zone is disease- or pest-free. This article presents some of the disputes caused by reluctance to apply the regionalization principle in the case of the three main transboundary diseases that have affected meat trade in recent years: "mad cow disease", foot and mouth disease, and avian flu. This article analyses the positions taken by some consumer markets and the challenges that the principal exporting nations have faced when confronted with <b>trade</b> <b>embargoes...</b>|$|R
