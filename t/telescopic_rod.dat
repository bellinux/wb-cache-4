2500|$|Tenkara rods are {{a type of}} fly rod {{used for}} tenkara fishing in Japan. A mixture of the rods in the other categories, they are carbon rods, fly <b>rods</b> and <b>telescopic</b> <b>rods</b> all in one. These are ultra-light and very {{portable}} <b>telescopic</b> <b>rods</b> (read more about telescopic below). Their extended length normally ranges from 11 to 13 feet, {{and they have a}} very soft action. The action of tenkara rods has been standardized as a ratio of [...] "how many parts are stiffer : how many tip parts bend more easily". The standard actions are 5:5, 6:4, 7:3, and 8:2, with 5:5 being a softer/slower rod, and 8:2 being a stiffer rod. Similar to western fly-rods tenkara rods also have cork, and sometimes even wooden handles, with wooden handles (such as red-pine, and phoenix-tree wood) being the more prized rods due to their increased sensitivity to fish bites and the heavier feel that helps balance the rods. Tenkara rods have no guides. Tenkara is a fixed-line fishing method, where no reel is used, but rather the line is tied directly to the tip of the rod. Like the carbon rods mentioned above this allows for [...] "very precise positioning of the fly of which the which in turn enables huge catches of fish with accurate feeding". One of the most common flies used in tenkara fishing is the Sakasa Kebari. Tenkara fishing is very popular in Japan, where these rods can be found in every major tackle shop. In the US, tenkara is beginning to grow in popularity.|$|R

40|$|Background: Knee and elbow flexion contractures are a {{frequent}} cause of ambulation and function problems that often require extensive rehabilitation. Traditional methods are of limited benefit in severe and fixed contracture. A new static progressive splint was developed from daily-use knee and elbow orthosis and a newly invented gradual <b>telescopic</b> <b>rod,</b> {{which is designed}} to provide low load, and gradual and prolonged stretching. Material and Method: The splint was used in ten cases (11 knees) of knee flexion contracture and three cases of elbow flexion contracture. There were multiple etiologies of contracture such as burn scar contractures, intra-articular fractures, septic arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and immobilization. The average timing of the contracture before splinting was 14. 6 months (range, 2 to 36) in the knee group and 16. 7 months (range, 6 to 30) in the elbow group. Results: The average initial extension was- 53. 6 degrees (range,- 30 to- 85) in the knee group and- 70 degrees (range- 65 to- 80) in the elbow group. The average post treatment extension was- 15 degrees (range, 0 to- 30) in the knee group and- 38. 3 degrees (range,- 30 to- 45) in the elbow group. The average duration of treatment was 9. 2 weeks (range, 4 to 16) in the knee group and 14 weeks (range, 11 to 20) in the elbow group. The most dramatic result was found in the patient who had burn scar flexion contractures of both knees for 20 months. The knee extensions increased from- 60 and- 85 degrees to full extension in four and 14 weeks after treatment, respectively. There were no recurrences or complications from the use of this splint. The patients were able to easily adjust the gradual <b>telescopic</b> <b>rod</b> themselves to provide the appropriate force for stretching.

The Equivalent Capacitor Substitution Method (ECSM) is adopted in ANSI and CISPR standards. One of major uncertainty factors of ECSM is the accuracy of capacitance. A novel capacitance extraction method based on full-wave impedance modelling is proposed in this paper, which is more accurate than conventional analytical formulae and experienced values, especially for practical monopole antennas, with a <b>telescopic</b> <b>rod,</b> or with a finite ground plane. A projection based model order reduction method is then utilized to achieve a compact macro-model.

30|$|Telescopic rodding {{has been}} {{developed}} {{in order to obtain}} long-lasting osteosynthesis in the growing long bones of children with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). The major and still unsolved drawback of any <b>telescopic</b> <b>rod</b> or nail design is a lack of rotational stability and, currently, no telescopic system allows immediate weight-bearing. When these problems are associated with insufficient longitudinal bone stability and diminished healing capacity, the result can be unfavourable causing secondary bone fragment displacement, delayed or non-union. This article presents a case report of operative treatment in a 9 -year-old girl affected with OI type VIII complicated with postoperative defect and pseudarthrosis of the femur causing functional impairment with loss of walking ability. A combination of intramedullary flexible nailing and minimal external fixation was applied for treatment of femoral defect-pseudarthrosis in a girl of 9  years with OI type VIII. Intramedullary and extramedullary nails with wrapping of titanium nickel mesh subperiosteally provided osteosynthesis and deformity correction of the tibia of a small intramedullary canal diameter. Upright standing and walking with progressive weight-bearing was started 4  days after surgery. There were no septic or vascular complications nor complications related to Ilizarov fixator. Radiographs demonstrated bone union in the femur 46  days after surgery. At the follow-up visit 9  months after fixator removal, clinical alignment remained excellent without any relapse of deformity. Bone remodelling with restitution of medullary canal was noted on lower limb radiographs. The patient was able to stand and walk without pain with an aide or walker. At the follow-up visit 17  months after fixator removal, there was no decrease in achieved functional abilities and the treatment outcome remained satisfactory. Use of an external fixator with intramedullary nailing for treatment of postoperative pseudarthrosis in patient with severe OI (recessive form of OI, type VIII) provides longitudinal, rotational and angular stability. Furthermore, this approach ensured early functional activity and walking with full weight-bearing, both favourable conditions for bone tissue regeneration. The external fixator was applied for a short period and only for additional stability and not for progressive deformity correction or other manipulation. In addition, the combination of intramedullary and extramedullary nailing and subperiosteal titanium nickel mesh seems to be promising for osteosynthesis in the deformity correction of bones with small diameter in children with OI.|$|E
30|$|In this case, the {{combination}} of FIN and Ilizarov fixator ensured stability for the femoral bone fragments and permitted early full weight-bearing in the immediate postoperative period. That resulted in bone union at the pseudarthrosis site within 45  days. There was no secondary torsional deformity in postoperative period. This approach represents an advantage {{in comparison with the}} use of <b>telescopic</b> <b>rodding</b> alone. With regard to the tibial deformity correction, a combination of intramedullary flexible nail, subperiosteal flexible nail and subperiosteal titanium net seems to be useful in small diameter shaft bones. The achievement of all normal radiological parameters of anteroposterior alignment of lower limbs [45] in children with severe forms of OI may be improbable, but overall realignment should be considered as crucial for the goal of better quality of life including mobility and functional independence.|$|R

Os animais foram divididos em cinco grupos formados cada um por três cães, submetidos às seguintes condutas: A- oito dias de alongamento, B- 15 dias de alongamento, C- 22 dias de alongamento, D- 28 dias de alongamento e oito dias de fase neutra com o fixador e E- 28 dias de alongamento, 60 dias de fase neutra com fixador e 45 dias sem fixador. No período de distração os animais desenvolveram gradual e progressiva contratura em flexão da articulação antebraquiocárpica, que persistiu no grupo E após a remoção do fixador. Conclui-se que no alongamento do antebraço há tendência para o desenvolvimento de contratura, recomendando-se medidas preventivas e fisioterapia. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate configuration of the Ilizarov fixator for simultaneous lengthening of radius and ulna. Fifteen adult crossbreed dogs weighting from 17 to 27 kg were used.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Managing spinal {{deformities}} {{in young}} children is challenging, particularly early onset scoliosis (EOS). Surgical intervention is often required if EOS has been unresponsive to conservative treatment particularly with rapidly progressive curves. An emerging treatment option for EOS is fusionless scoliosis surgery. Similar to bracing, this surgical option potentially harnesses growth, motion and function of the spine along with correcting spinal deformity. Dual growing rods are one such fusionless treatment, which aims to modulate growth of the vertebrae. The {{aim of this study}} was to ascertain the extent to which semiconstrained growing rods (Medtronic, Sofamor, Danek, Memphis, TN) with a telescopic sleeve component, reduce rotational constraint on the spine compared with standard "constrained / rigid" rods and hence potentially provide a more physiological mechanical environment for the growing spine. METHODS Six 40 - 60 kg English Large White porcine spines served as a model for the paediatric human spine. Each spine was dissected into a 7 level thoracolumbar multi-segment unit (MSU), removing all non-ligamentous soft tissues and leaving 3 cm of ribs either side. Pure nondestructive axial rotation moments of ± 4 Nm at a constant rotation rate of 8 deg. s- 1 were applied to the mounted MSU spines using a biaxial Instron testing machine. Displacement of each vertebral level was captured using a 3 D motion tracking system (Optotrak 3020, Northern Digital Inc, Waterloo, ON). Each spine was tested in an un-instrumented state first and then with appropriately sized semi-constrained growing rods and rigid rods in alternating sequence. The rods were secured by multi-axial pedicle screws (Medtronic CD Horizon) at levels 2 and 6 of the construct. The range of motion (ROM), neutral zone (NZ) size and stiffness (Nm. deg- 1) were calculated from the Instron load-displacement data and intervertebral ROM was calculated through a MATLAB algorithm from Optotrak data. RESULTS Irrespective of the order of testing, rigid rods significantly reduced the total ROM compared with semi-constrained rods (p< 0. 05) with in a significantly stiffer spine for both left and right axial rotation (p< 0. 05). Analysing the intervertebral motion within the instrumented levels 2 - 6, rigid rods showed reduced ROM compared with semi-constrained growing rods and compared with un-instrumented motion segments. CONCLUSION Semi-constrained growing rods maintain similar stiffness in axial rotation to un-instrumented spines, while dual rigid rods significantly reduce axial rotation. Clinically the effect of semi-constrained growing rods as observed in this study is that they would be expected to allow growth via the <b>telescopic</b> <b>rod</b> components while maintaining the axial flexibility of the spine, which may reduce occurrence of the crankshaft phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} (Hughes, Haddad, Franz, Zelaznik, 2 ̆ 6 Ryu, under review) {{has demonstrated}} that when the hands manipulate two objects that are physically coupled they exhibit greater spatiotemporal independence. On {{the basis of these}} results it was proposed that if the actions of the individual hands can be conceptualized as subparts of a larger action (or task) then the tendency toward spatiotemporal synchronization could be reduced. Thus, the present experiments were designed to explore interlimb coordination during the manipulation of physically coupled objects. In the first paper, participants were assigned to either a control or transfer group. Participants in the control group performed the task when the objects were separate (no-spring group) or when the objects were connected by a spring (spring group). Participants in the transfer group either performed the task when the objects were separate, and then when the objects were connected by a spring (no-spring-first group), or in the reverse order (spring-first-group). The task required participants to grasp and place two objects on a target board to either identical or different object end-orientations. Regardless of the order in which the tasks were performed, the hands were less coupled when manipulating objects that were connected compared to objects that were not connected. Thus, the spatiotemporal trajectories of the individual hands appeared to be less constrained when the objects were physically connected. This result supported the interpretation that {{the manner in which the}} manipulated objects were perceived can modulate the constraints that underlie bimanual coordination. This perceptual interpretation was directly tested in the second paper by manipulating the manner in which the objects were coupled. Participant’s manipulated objects that were not connected, connected with a <b>telescopic</b> <b>rod,</b> or connected with a band or spring in which stiffness constants varied based on the type of physical connection. There were three main findings: (1) interlimb coupling was similar between the no-stiffness and rod groups (2) interlimb coupling changed as a function of the stiffness of the connecting material, and (3) although the right hand moved toward the target in a straighter fashion when the objects were physically independent, this was reversed when the objects were connected. In this context, the non-dominant left hand performed the task in a straighter fashion than the dominant right hand. That is, the left-hand adopted a stabilizing role while the dominant right hand adopted a more manipulative role. Thus, there was no support for the perceptual interpretation forwarded in the first paper. Instead, it is proposed that the tactics employed by the central nervous system (CNS) changes in response to different behavioral contexts as well as physical demands. ...|$|E
30|$|The IRF (Ilizarov 1989 a, b) {{consists}} of two rings that {{are attached to the}} bone by two orthogonally arranged full pins (with K-wires completely traversing the bone) and four <b>telescopic</b> <b>rods.</b> The pins are tensed to 90 – 130  kg using a special appliance; this increases the stability of the construct, as the tensed K-wires have a self-reinforcing effect if bending occurs and have a rigidity equivalent to that of 4 -mm Schanz pins (Cattaneo et al. 1992; Aronson 1994; Aronson et al. 1989). The traction is applied concentrically, in contrast to the MLF (which is eccentric), ensuring consistent formation of regeneration tissue. In addition, the rotational rigidity and the curvature of the osteotomy ends prevent the development of malpositioning, while the axial elasticity promotes osseous regeneration (Paley 1988). The small pin diameter prevents the development of osteolysis and osteitis (Paley 1988; Aronson 1994; Aronson et al. 1989). This fixator has considerable disadvantages due to its bulky frame and limitations on everyday mobility (Donnan et al. 2003). As the assembly of the IRF appears initially easy to grasp, the comparatively shallow learning curve for the surgeon often only emerges as a result of complications during follow-up treatment of the first patients (Feldman et al. 2003).|$|R
