40|$|Summary of Invention In {{accordance}} with {{an aspect of}} the invention there is provided a method for allocating a plurality of power reserves to deliver power to a power network to meet a power reserve requirement for balancing a frequency of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network. <b>The</b> method comprises obtaining, for a plurality of power reserves of a power network, power reserve flexibility characteristics associated with each <b>power</b> reserve. <b>The</b> method further comprises obtaining, for <b>the</b> plurality of <b>power</b> reserves, an indexing value associated with <b>the</b> delivery of <b>power</b> by each of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserves. <b>The</b> method further comprises determining a power reserve requirement associated with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network. <b>The</b> method further comprises assigning one or more of <b>the</b> plurality of <b>power</b> reserves to deliver <b>power</b> to <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network, <b>the</b> plurality of <b>power</b> reserves assigned in {{accordance with}} <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics associated with each of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserves, <b>the</b> indexing value associated with each of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserves, and <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement associated with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network. <b>The</b> <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics may be indicative of <b>power</b> deliverable to <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network by <b>the</b> respective <b>power</b> reserve with respect to time. <b>The</b> <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics may include characteristics of positive and/or negative <b>power</b> reserve flexibility. <b>The</b> <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics may include one or more of a maximum deliverable power, a period of time to provide <b>the</b> maximum deliverable <b>power</b> from receipt of an instruction for power delivery, a minimum duration for sustaining <b>the</b> maximum deliverable <b>power</b> and a period of time to reduce <b>power</b> delivery from <b>the</b> maximum deliverable <b>power</b> to a minimum deliverable <b>power.</b> <b>The</b> assigning of one or more of <b>the</b> plurality of <b>power</b> reserves may further comprise selecting one or more of <b>the</b> plurality <b>power</b> reserves to provide <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement in order of the indexing value associated with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve. <b>The</b> method may further comprise ordering <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserves in accordance with the indexing value associated with each power reserve prior to selecting the one or more power reserves to provide <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement. <b>The</b> assigning of one or more of <b>the</b> plurality of <b>power</b> reserves may further comprise determining a portion of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network provided by each selected power reserve in accordance with <b>the</b> respective <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserves. Assigning <b>the</b> one or more power reserves may further comprise determining if, for a particular instance in time, <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement is met by the assigned one or more power reserves, assigning a next power reserve to deliver <b>power</b> to <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network if <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement is not met, <b>the</b> next <b>power</b> reserve determined from the order of the indexing values associated with <b>the</b> respective <b>power</b> reserves and adjusting a power to be delivered to <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network by a most recently allocated reserve of the one or more power reserves that have been assigned to provide power at that instant in time to a level of power sufficient to meet <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement at that instant in time if <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement is met. <b>The</b> <b>power</b> to be delivered by the most recently allocated reserve may be adjusted by subtracting the difference between <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement at that instant in time and a summation of a power to be delivered at that instant in time by each of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserves assigned to deliver power at that instant in time from <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to be delivered at that instant in time by the most recently allocated reserve assigned to deliver power at that instant in time. Assigning the one or more power reserves may further comprise determining if the one or more assigned <b>power</b> reserves provide <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement, continuing assigning the reserves if <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement is not met and stopping the assigning the reserves if <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement is met. The method may further comprise determining, prior to assigning one or more of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserves, whether or not <b>the</b> plurality of <b>power</b> reserves will be able to provide <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement from <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics associated with <b>the</b> plurality of <b>power</b> reserves. <b>The</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement associated with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network may be a power required to be delivered to the network over a period of time. <b>The</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement associated with a power network may be determined by estimating a power reserve requirement associated with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network. <b>The</b> <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics may be obtained from a memory. The indexing value may be obtained from a memory. The method may further comprise receiving <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics and receiving the indexing values. <b>The</b> <b>power</b> reserve flexibility characteristics associated with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserves may be received from <b>the</b> respective <b>power</b> reserves. <b>The</b> method may further comprise instructing <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserves to deliver power in accordance with the assignment of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserves. A power reserve may be a power generator or a <b>power</b> load. <b>The</b> indexing value may be a financial cost associated with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve delivering <b>the</b> <b>power.</b> <b>The</b> indexing value may be an environmental impact associated with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve delivering <b>the</b> <b>power.</b> In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided an apparatus for allocating a plurality of power reserves to deliver power to a power network to meet a power reserve requirement of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network. <b>The</b> apparatus comprises a processor arranged to perform any method disclosed herein. The apparatus may be a central controller associated with management of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network. In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided a computer readable medium comprising computer readable code operable, in use, to instruct a computer to perform any method disclosed herein. According to {{an aspect of the}} invention there is provided a method for allocating power reserves in a <b>power</b> network. <b>The</b> method comprises determining a power reserve requirement associated with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network. <b>The</b> method then comprises assigning power reserves associated with the network to deliver <b>power</b> for meeting <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement, <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserves assigned according to an indexing value associated with delivery of power by respective power reserves. Throughout this disclosure it will be understood that each indexing value assigned to a power reserve may correspond to a financial cost associated with that reserve. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a method for allocating power reserves in a <b>power</b> network. <b>The</b> method comprises determining a power reserve requirement associated with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network. <b>The</b> method then comprises assigning power reserves associated with the network for meeting <b>the</b> determined <b>power</b> reserve requirement, <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserves assigned according to a power response characteristic associated with each of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserves. According to a further aspect of the invention a method for allocating power resources provided by a plurality of power reserves in a power network to meet a power reserve requirement of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network is provided. The method comprises obtaining, for a plurality of power reserves, information indicative of power response characteristics associated with power resources provided by <b>the</b> respective <b>power</b> reserves. <b>The</b> method also comprises obtaining, for <b>the</b> plurality of <b>power</b> reserves, information indicative of an indexing value associated with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> resources provided by <b>the</b> respective <b>power</b> reserves. In addition, the method comprises determining a power reserve requirement associated with a <b>power</b> network. <b>The</b> method also comprises assigning one or more power resources provided by <b>the</b> plurality of <b>power</b> reserves in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> response characteristics and the indexing value associated with each power resource provided by <b>the</b> plurality of <b>power</b> reserves to provide <b>the</b> <b>power</b> resource requirement. <b>The</b> <b>power</b> response characteristic may be considered as a deliverable power response of a <b>power</b> reserve. Also <b>the</b> <b>power</b> response characteristic may be considered as a mapping of <b>the</b> highest <b>power</b> and longest duration positive and negative power response with respect to time associated with a power reserve. Such a system of mapping of power reserve supply and reserve requirement allows for simple description of any flexible resource, intermittent source or frequency service regardless of their particular dynamic response. Once the method is complete, the reserve requirement may be fully accounted for by the cumulative supply provided by the least expensive available reserves. The method may be applicable to forecasted worst-case intermittency, or can be applied to state of the art frequency control services such that reserves are allocated to individual FCR, FRR or RR services. The cumulative supply can be decomposed to determine and share cost of intermittency. The method may provide intuitive visual reserve adequacy assessment and user input allocation via a user interface. The methods described herein allow for available resources to be used to their fullest which can bring down the price of reserves and may lead to a significant cost reduction for the various system operators by enlarging the pool of available reserves. A system for defining resources irrespective of type is disclosed. Consequently, a single definition system is provided to identify <b>the</b> <b>power</b> characteristics of flexible resources, intermittent resources, or frequency services regardless of their particular dynamic response. A system that enables a user to be provided with a visual reserve adequacy assessment and reserve distribution is disclosed...|$|R
