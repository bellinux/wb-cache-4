5|$|In January 2012, it was {{announced}} that the Willmott Dixon Group had been appointed as contractor on the scheme. The Council's planning committee in August 2012 deferred the approval decision, pending alterations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>external</b> appearance of the building. These were approved in October 2012, with demolition commencing in the same month. The regenerated Civic Centre area came back into use in late 2014 and early 2015.|$|E
5|$|A {{reusable}} Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) {{launch vehicle}} was {{planned to be}} implemented about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to Ariane 5. However, only a preliminary analysis of TSTO was completed. The proposed configuration consisted of two boosters with retractable wings attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>external</b> fuel tank, and a reusable orbiter with fixed wings carrying payload on top of it. During geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) missions, an additional, expandable upper stage would be used.|$|E

The indicator, called the "external sector development index" (SXi), is a new analytical tool for studying <b>the</b> <b>external</b> sector behaviour of any country or region. The SXi has four objectives. The first objective is <b>to</b> measure <b>the</b> vulnerability of <b>the</b> <b>external</b> sector of any country. <b>The</b> second is <b>to</b> evaluate <b>the</b> <b>external</b> sector performance. <b>The</b> third is <b>to</b> analyze <b>the</b> relationship between "the external sector main variable" ESi and GDP growth rates. <b>The</b> fourth is <b>to</b> evaluate <b>the</b> <b>external</b> sector (SXi) cycle based on the table of possible combinations between ESi and GDP. In our case, we apply the SXi on the Chinese and ASEAN economies. ...|$|R
5|$|Both the {{external}} walls and those around the keep were fitted with merlons and parapets, with the parapets of the keep positioned 6.5 meters higher {{than their counterparts}} along {{the external}} wall. This was done to establish a secondary defensive line that enabled the building's defenders to shoot arrows at attackers who breached the external walls. The core building was linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>external</b> fortifications by corridors and chambers.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{clitoral}} stimulation involves physical stimulation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>external</b> {{anatomy of}} the clitorisâ€“ glans, hood and the external shaft. Stimulation of the labia minora (inner lips), due to its external connection with the glans and hood, may {{have the same effect}} as direct clitoral stimulation. Though these areas may also receive indirect physical stimulation during sexual activity, such as when in friction with the labia majora (outer lips), indirect clitoral stimulation is more commonly attributed to penile-vaginal penetration. Penile-anal penetration may also indirectly stimulate the clitoris, either by the shared sensory nerves (especially the pudendal nerve, which gives off the inferior anal nerves and divides into two terminal branches: the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris) or by the crura ("legs").|$|E
5|$|During {{the solar}} cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the {{internal}} {{toroidal magnetic field}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>external</b> poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number and size. At solar-cycle minimum, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength. With {{the rise of the}} next 11-year sunspot cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|Females are {{generally}} attracted to males by their calls, though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur {{during which the}} character of the call changes. The female mounts the male and a single spermatophore is transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>external</b> genitalia of the female. Sperm flows from this into the female's oviduct over a period of a few minutes or up to an hour, depending on species. After copulation, the female may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Housing Act 1980 gave council tenants {{the right}} to buy their homes. In light of this, a group of 1500 {{properties}} in the area was given Conservation Area status, and Plumbe's northern section of the estate was granted Article Four Direction by Michael Heseltine, Secretary of State for the Environment, preventing any alterations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>external</b> appearances of the properties without planning permission, in recognition of its architectural and historic interest. St Mark's Church was meanwhile Grade II listed. However, these measures have not been consistently enforced, and Noel Park has been cited in a report by English Heritage as a prominent example of the failure of conservation areas.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{a mixture}} of sand and cement was applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>external</b> faces of the mosque with the {{intention}} of protecting the mosque from wind and rain damage. However, this treatment resulted in substantial damage to the building as moisture became trapped in the walls built of mud and started a deterioration process of the structure, with termites infesting the wooden supports under humid conditions. This resulted in part of the mosque collapsing and during the repair work it caused some distortions of the structural elements and the exterior of the mosque.|$|E

5|$|Injuries <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>external</b> ear occur fairly frequently, and {{can leave}} minor to major deformity. Injuries include: laceration, {{avulsion}} injuries, burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an ear, for discipline or torture. Chronic {{damage to the}} ears can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, the external ear is susceptible to frostbite as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 2008, after a delay {{following}} Tropical Storm Fay, Atlantis was rolled {{from the}} Orbiter Processing Facility to the Vehicle Assembly Building, {{where it was}} mated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>external</b> fuel tank and solid rocket booster stack. Problems were encountered during the mating process, and poor weather due to Hurricane Hanna caused a delay in the rollout of Atlantis to the launch pad, which is normally done seven days after rollover.|$|E
5|$|Three {{channels}} facilitate lymphatic drainage {{from the}} cervix. The anterior and lateral cervix drains to nodes along the uterine arteries, travelling along the cardinal ligaments {{at the base}} of the broad ligament <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>external</b> iliac lymph nodes and ultimately the paraaortic lymph nodes. The posterior and lateral cervix drains along the uterine arteries to the internal iliac lymph nodes and ultimately the paraaortic lymph nodes, and the posterior section of the cervix drains to the obturator and presacral lymph nodes. However, there are variations as lymphatic drainage from the cervix travels to different sets of pelvic nodes in some people. This has implications in scanning nodes for involvement in cervical cancer.|$|E

5|$|Two sets {{of muscles}} are {{associated}} with the outer ear: the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. In some mammals, these muscles can adjust the direction of the pinna. In humans, these muscles have little or no effect. The ear muscles are supplied by the facial nerve, which also supplies sensation to the skin of the ear itself, as well as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>external</b> ear cavity. The great auricular nerve, auricular nerve, auriculotemporal nerve, and lesser and greater occipital nerves of the cervical plexus all supply sensation to parts of the outer ear and the surrounding skin.|$|E
5|$|From his {{extensive}} fieldwork and research experience, Dani refuted any influence of South Indian culture on the Indus Valley Civilization. Using a geographic {{perspective of the}} socio-political systems and cultural distribution of the Indus Basin and surrounding hinterland, he observed that the Indo-Gangetic Plain did not play any {{significant role in the}} development of Indus Valley culture. Nor was there any invasion from the seaside during the Bronze Age, although the coastline facilitated maritime trade. The major influence, according to Dani, came from Central Asia in the west. He asserted that the hilly western borderland that appears as a boundary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>external</b> eye is actually a network of hill plateaus where the local people have always moved freely. He therefore argued that the cultural history of Pakistan is more closely related to Central Asia through Buddhist, Persian and later Sufi influences. He strove to revive this relationship by promoting organisations such as the Pak-Central Asia Friendship Association.|$|E
5|$|The Black Stone {{was held}} in reverence well before the preaching of Islam by Muhammad. It had long been {{associated}} with the Kaaba, which was built in the pre-Islamic period and was a site of pilgrimage of Nabateans who visited the shrine once a year to perform their pilgrimage. The Kaaba held 360 idols of the Meccan gods. The Semitic cultures of the Middle East had a tradition of using unusual stones to mark places of worship, a phenomenon which is reflected in the Hebrew Bible as well as the Qur'an, although bowing to or kissing such sacred objects is repeatedly described in the Tanakh as idolatrous and was the subject of prophetic rebuke. The meteorite-origin theory of the Black Stone has seen it likened by some writers to the meteorite which was placed and worshipped in the Greek Temple of Artemis. Some writers remark on the apparent similarity of the Black Stone and its frame <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>external</b> female genitalia, and ascribe this to its earlier association with fertility rites of Arabia.|$|E

5|$|Traditional {{styles of}} {{architecture}} in Madagascar have been impacted {{over the past}} two hundred years by the increasing influence of European styles. A shift toward brick construction in the Highlands began during the reign of Queen Ranavalona II (1868â€“1883) based on models introduced by missionaries of the London Missionary Society and contacts with other foreigners. Foreign influence further expanded following the collapse of the monarchy and French colonization of the island in 1896. Modernization {{over the past several decades}} has increasingly led to the abandonment of certain traditional norms related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>external</b> orientation and internal layout of houses and the use of certain customary building materials, particularly in the Highlands. Among those with means, foreign construction materials and techniques â€“ namely imported concrete, glass and wrought iron features â€“ have gained in popularity, to the detriment of traditional practices.|$|E
5|$|Up to the pontificate of Pope Alexander III (1159â€“1181), all the {{cardinals}} who were appointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>external</b> episcopal sees, resigned their {{membership in the}} College of Cardinals after receiving episcopal consecration, which clearly shows that the episcopate was considered a higher dignity than that of cardinal-priest or deacon. On the other hand, the bishops were never appointed cardinals. Certainly, the episcopate and cardinalate were considered incompatible dignities. However, during Alexanderâ€™s pontificate a change is apparent; although there were still the cases of {{the cardinals}} leaving the College of Cardinals after assuming episcopal office (Lombardo of Benevento, Rainaldo of Gaeta), there also appeared members of the College who were simultaneously cardinals and bishops. Perhaps Alexander III followed here an example of his rival, Antipope Victor IV, who in 1162 appointed Aicardo Cornazzano bishop of Parma and cardinal-priest. The first such instance in the legitimate obedience was Conrad of Wittelsbach, who was appointed cardinal-priest of S. Marcello in December 1165 and subsequently promoted to the suburbicarian see of Sabina, but continued to act also as archbishop of Mainz. Archbishop of Reims Guillaume aux Blanches Mains was named cardinal priest of S. Sabina in 1179, but retained archdiocese of Reims; similarly bishops Giovanni of Toscanella, Ruffino of Rimini and Gerardo of Novara, elevated to the cardinalate in 1189, 1190 and 1211 respectively. On the other hand, when cardinal-priest Uberto Crivelli was elected and consecrated archbishop of Milan in 1185, he retained his cardinalate and his Roman titulus (S. Lorenzo in Damaso). The posts of cardinal and bishop were no longer considered incompatible with each other. Moreover, the rank of cardinal-priest or cardinal-deacon became {{equal to that of}} bishop. However, it seems that the elected, but not yet consecrated, bishops who were appointed cardinals were generally obliged to resign their sees.|$|E
