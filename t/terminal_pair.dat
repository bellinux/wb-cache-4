This species {{differs from the}} last in the stems and leaves being thicker or coarser; their {{divisions}} form a more acute angle with one another; the notches on the leaves bear three or four short bristles instead of one; and the bladders are twice as large, or about 1/5 of an inch (5.08 mm.) in diameter. In all essential respects the bladders resemble those of Utricularia neglecta, but {{the sides of the}} peristome are perhaps a little more [page 429] prominent, and always bear, as far as I have seen, seven or eight long multicellular bristles. There are eleven long bristles on each antenna, the <b>terminal</b> <b>pair</b> being included. Five bladders, containing prey of some kind, were examined. The first included five Cypris; a large copepod and a Diaptomus; the second, four Cypris; the third, a single rather large crustacean; the fourth, six crustaceans; and the fifth, ten. My son examined the quadrifid processes in a bladder containing the remains of two crustaceans, and found some of them full of spherical or irregularly shaped masses of matter, which were observed to move and to coalesce. These masses therefore consisted of protoplasm.|$|E

This is a classical NP-complete problem for which no general approximation techniques are known; it has recently been brought into focus in papers discussing applications to admission control in high-speed networks and to routing in all- optical networks. In this paper we provideO(logn) -approximation algorithms for two natural optimization versions of this problem for the class of nearly Eulerian, uniformly high-diameter planar graphs, which includes two-dimensional meshes and other common planar interconnection networks.

The latter result improves on anO(log 2 n) -approximation for the special case of the mesh obtained independently by Aumann and Rabani.
