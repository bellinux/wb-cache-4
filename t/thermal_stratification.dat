25|$|F.A. Forel, {{who is also}} {{referred}} to as the father of limnology, was the first scientist to classify lakes according to their <b>thermal</b> <b>stratification.</b> His system of classification was later modified and improved upon by Hutchinson and Laffler. Because the density of water varies with temperature, with a maximum at +4 DC, <b>thermal</b> <b>stratification</b> is an important physical characteristic of lakes that controls the fauna and flora, sedimentation, chemistry, and other aspects of individual lakes. First, the colder, heavier water typically forms a layer near the bottom, which called the hypolimnion. Second, normally overlying it is a transition zone known as the metalimnion. Finally, overlying the metalimnion is a surface layer of a warmer, lighter water is called the epilimnion. However, this typical stratification sequence can vary widely depending either on the specific lake, the time of season, or combination of both.|$|E
2500|$|Based upon <b>thermal</b> <b>stratification,</b> lakes are {{classified}} as either holomictic lakes or meromictic lakes. A meromictic lake is a lake which has layers of water which do not intermix. The deepest layer of water in such a lake does not contain any dissolved oxygen. In addition, the [...] layers of sediment {{at the bottom of}} a meromictic lake remain relatively undisturbed because there are no living aerobic organisms. The lack of disturbance allows for the development of lacustrine varves. A Holomictic lake is a lake that has a uniform temperature and density from top to bottom at a specific time during the year. This uniformity temperature and density in allows the lake waters to completely mix. Holomictic lakes are non-meromictic lakes. Based upon <b>thermal</b> <b>stratification</b> and frequency of turnover, holomictic lakes are divided into amictic lakes, cold monomictic lakes, dimictic lakes, warm monomictic lakes, polymictic lakes, and oligomictic lakes. The classification of lakes by <b>thermal</b> <b>stratification</b> presupposes lakes with sufficient depth to form a hypolimnion. As a results, very shallow lakes are excluded this classification system.|$|E

2500|$|Because of its {{sheltered}} location, Todd Lake has distinct <b>thermal</b> <b>stratification</b> levels {{within its}} water column.

2500|$|Oxygen is {{essential}} for organismal respiration. [...] The amount of oxygen present in standing waters depends upon: [...] 1) the area of transparent water exposed to the air, 2) the circulation of water within the system and 3) the amount of oxygen generated and used by organisms present. In shallow, plant-rich pools there may be great fluctuations of oxygen, with extremely high concentrations occurring during the day due to photosynthesis and very low values at night when respiration is the dominant process of primary producers. [...] <b>Thermal</b> <b>stratification</b> in larger systems can also affect the amount of oxygen present in different zones. [...] The epilimnion is oxygen rich because it circulates quickly, gaining oxygen via contact with the air. [...] The hypolimnion, however, circulates very slowly and has no atmospheric contact. [...] Additionally, fewer green plants exist in the hypolimnion, so there is less oxygen released from photosynthesis. [...] In spring and fall when the epilimnion and hypolimnion mix, oxygen becomes more evenly distributed in the system. Low oxygen levels are characteristic of the profundal zone due to the accumulation of decaying vegetation and animal matter that “rains” down from the pelagic and benthic zones and the inability to support primary producers.|$|E

This study adopts an Eulerian method to investigate the spatial concentration distribution and temporal evolution of exhaled and sneezed/coughed droplets {{within the range of}} 1. 0 ~ 10. 0 μm in an office room with three air distribution methods, i. e. mixing ventilation (MV), displacement ventilation (DV), and under-floor air distribution (UFAD). The diffusion, gravitational settling, and deposition mechanism of particulate matters are well accounted in the one-way coupling Eulerian approach. The simulation results find that exhaled droplets with diameters up to 10. 0 μm from normal respiration process are uniformly distributed in MV, while they are trapped in the breathing height by <b>thermal</b> <b>stratifications</b> in DV and UFAD, resulting in a high droplet concentration and a high exposure risk to other occupants.

40|$|The {{impacts of}} the diurnal {{variation}} of surface temperature on street canyon flow pattern and pollutant dispersion are investigated based on a two-dimensional street canyon model under different <b>thermal</b> <b>stratifications.</b> Uneven distributed street temperature conditions and a user-defined wall function representing the heat transfer between {{the air and the}} street canyon are integrated into the current numerical model. The prediction accuracy of this model is successfully validated against a published wind tunnel experiment. Then, a series of numerical simulations representing four time scenarios (Morning, Afternoon, Noon and Night) are performed at different Bulk Richardson number (Rb). The results demonstrate that uneven distributed street temperature conditions significantly alters street canyon flow structure and pollutant dispersion characteristics compared with conventional uniform street temperature assumption, especially for the morning event. Moreover, air flow patterns and pollutant dispersion are greatly influenced by diurnal variation of surface temperature under unstable stratification conditions. Furthermore, the residual pollutant in near-ground-zone decreases as Rb increases in noon, afternoon and night events under all studied stability conditions...|$|R

40|$|Five sets of large-eddy {{simulations}} (LES) {{were performed}} to examine the characteristics of flows and pollutant dispersion in two-dimensional (2 D) urban street canyons of unity building-height-to-street-width ratio in neutral, unstable, and stable <b>thermal</b> <b>stratifications.</b> The characteristic flows fall into the skimming flow regime for all the cases tested. The mean wind speed is increased and decreased, respectively, in unstable and stable conditions. Turbulence is enhanced in unstable conditions. Whereas, in stable conditions, the low-level temperature inversion weakens the recirculating flows forming another layer of stagnant air {{in the vicinity of}} the ground level. Unexpectedly, an increase in turbulence is found in the street canyon core in the slightly stable condition (Richardson number Rb= 0. 18). The turbulence promotion could be caused by the unique geometry of 2 D street canyon in which the stable stratification slows down the primary recirculation. The rather stagnant flows in turn sharpen the roof-level vertical velocity gradient and deter the entrainment penetrating down to the ground level, leading to a substantial pollutant accumulation. While the pollutant tends to be well mixed in the street canyons in neutral and unstable conditions, a mildly improved pollutant removal in unstable conditions is observed because of the enhanced roof-level buoyancy-driven turbulence. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Three {{scenarios}} of large-eddy simulation (LES) {{were performed to}} examine the characteristic flow and pollutant dispersion in urban street canyons under neutral, unstable and stable <b>thermal</b> <b>stratifications.</b> Street canyons of unity aspect ratio with ground-heating or –cooling are considered. In the LESs of the thermal stabilities tested, a large primary recirculation is developed in the center core and the turbulence production is dominated at the roof level of the street canyon. The current LES results demonstrate that unstable stratification enhances the mean wind, turbulence and pollutant removal of street canyons. On the other hand, in stable stratification, which has been less investigated in the past, the ground-level mean wind and turbulence are substantially suppressed by the large temperature inversion. Whereas, the weakened recirculating wind in the street canyon results in a larger velocity gradient that increases the turbulence production at the roof level. It also slows down the turbulence being carried from the roof down to the lower street canyon. Therefore, {{a higher level of}} turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is retained at the mid-level of the windward side in the stably stratified street canyon. postprintThe 5 th International Symposium on Computational Wind Engineering (CWE 2010), Chapel Hill, N.

A theory is proposed in Part I to describe the conditions of formation of these motions and depends on the new result that shear provides a powerful stabilizing influence even in non-viscous fluid motions in which denser fluid is situated above less dense. Those features of the flow which can be predicted by the theory and compared with observations are found to be in reasonably good agreement, and it is therefore indicated that the theory, which is based on a highly simplified model of flow, furnishes at least a qualitatively correct correlation of the basic ideas involved in the stable flow of very slightly viscous fluids containing density inversions. Applications to technically interesting flows of this type, in large-scale atmospheric motions as well as in high speed aerodynamic boundary layers, are indicated but not analyzed in detail. In Part II the perfect fluid flow is determined for a turbomachine of conical shape and prescribed blade loading.
