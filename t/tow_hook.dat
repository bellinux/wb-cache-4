2500|$|The Stemme S10 {{also has}} several unusual {{features}} such as a tailwheel undercarriage and a side-by-side cockpit. It {{does not have a}} <b>tow</b> <b>hook</b> connection so it must self-launch. The two main wheels retract and lower electrically, though they can also be lowered manually if needed. There is an option to fold wings to reduce hangar span to [...] The engine restart time is 5 seconds. A solar panel can provide additional electrical power during long flights. It has a steerable tailwheel, Schempp-Hirth spoilers and optional winglets. The current variant, the S10-VT, has a variable-pitch propeller which allows more power during take off, and a new turbocharged Bombardier Rotax 914F engine in place of the earlier Limbach L2400. Most parts are made in Poland, but future production will be handled by Remos Aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The {{military}} transport version, {{often called}} the Yak-16-II, differed from the passenger version as it carried a UTK-1 ball turret that mounted a [...] Berezin UBT machine gun immediately behind the flight deck, the cargo cabin floor was reinforced, the vertical tail was slightly larger and the fuselage was slightly longer. It used three-bladed V-511 feathering propellers with scimitar-shaped blades. It could carry seven paratroopers, ten fully equipped troops or six stretcher cases and a medical attendant. It was fitted with a large clamshell door {{on the left side}} of the fuselage to facilitate cargo loading. This door had a smaller, inward-opening door set into its forward half. Three TsDMMM-120 supply containers could be fitted on racks underneath the wing center section and it was fitted with a glider <b>tow</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Two {{types of}} {{die-cast}} toy models were sold under the Corgi Toy brand and manufactured by Mettoy Playcraft in the UK {{during the late}} 1960s. Both were done in [...] One was a two-tone red and black Marlin with opening doors and a <b>tow</b> <b>hook.</b> The [...] "Rambler Marlin Sports Fastback" [...] (Corgi 263) scale model was released in 1966 and withdrawn from the market in 1969. In addition to the two-tone paint with chrome bumpers and grille, the model features a detailed interior finished in white and the front seat backs can be tipped forward (as in the actual cars). The second was a gift boxed set (Corgi GS10) with the Marlin finished in blue with a white roof and featuring a roof rack for a kayak, as well as towing a matching utility trailer with opening hatches. Released in 1968, this set had a short run of just 11 months.|$|E
40|$|Whiplash injury occurs {{mainly as}} a result of {{rear-end}} collisions. The assumption is that the less easily flexible rear-end a car has, the greater the chance of whiplash. A fitted <b>towing</b> <b>hook</b> increases the stiffness of the rear-end of cars. This report explores the relationship between <b>towing</b> <b>hooks</b> and whiplash in greater depth. The old design of the <b>towing</b> <b>hook</b> has a negative influence on the crushable zone at the rear end of cars. At this moment, however, it is not clear if there is a problem as far as the number of whiplash accidents is concerned. No data is known about the numbers installed of the old design <b>towing</b> <b>hooks.</b> It can be concluded, that in the short term, not much can be done to improve the modern <b>towing</b> <b>hook</b> to reduce the chance of whiplash. That is why owners of cars fitted with a <b>towing</b> <b>hook</b> need information about the correct use of a head restraint...|$|R

They {{are used to}} tow caravans and trailers having no engine, which provide accommodation and haulage of loads, respectively. So, the transport capacity of cars is increased safely. <b>Towing</b> <b>hooks</b> require different constructive structures due to different chassis or monocoque body of each car type; hence {{they are to be}} manufactured and assembled in small- or middle-size factories as per order. In this study, three different constructions of <b>towing</b> <b>hook</b> are modelled and structurally analysed.

5000|$|The glider has 23 kW Front Electric Sustainer (FES) {{positioned}} {{in the nose}} which in combination with low takeoff weight is powerful enough {{to be used for}} self-launch.
