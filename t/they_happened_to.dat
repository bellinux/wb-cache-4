Carson and Anka had worked together in England on the television special An Evening with Paul Anka in 1961; when <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> meet up again in New York City the following year, Carson manager Al Bruno mentioned needing a theme.|$|E
25|$|Since a shiny metal {{parabolic}} reflector can also focus the sun's rays, and most dishes could concentrate enough solar energy on the feed structure to severely overheat it if <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be {{pointed at the}} sun, solid reflectors are always given a coat of flat paint.|$|E
25|$|The {{expected}} changeover to the {{new structure}} proved to be rare, irregular, and sometimes reversed. The new brigades that appeared were mostly divisions that had broken down until <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be at the proposed brigade strengths. New divisions—such as the new 3rd Motor Rifle Division in the Moscow Military District, formed {{on the basis of}} disbanding tank formations—were formed, rather than new brigades.|$|E

25|$|On 30 November 1919, Benedict XV {{appealed to}} all Catholics {{worldwide}} to sacrifice for Catholic missions, stating {{at the same}} time in Maximum Illud that these missions should foster local culture and not import European cultures. The damages of such cultural imports were particularly grave in Africa and Asia, where many missionaries were deported and incarcerated if <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> originate from a hostile nation.|$|E
25|$|It was {{generally}} believed that babies would not remember any pain that <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> feel, and {{that lack of}} conscious memory meant lack of long-term harm. Scientific studies on animals with various brain lesions were interpreted as supporting {{the idea that the}} responses seen in babies were merely spinal reflexes. Furthermore, the whole effort of relieving pain was considered futile since it was thought to be impossible to measure the child's pain.|$|E
25|$|Pope John XXIII's Code of Rubrics divided Sundays {{into two}} classes. Sundays of the I class were {{the four of}} Advent, the four of Lent, the two of Passiontide, Easter Sunday, Low Sunday, and Pentecost. No feast {{whatsoever}} could replace the celebration of these Sundays, with the sole exception of {{the feast of the}} Immaculate Conception. All other Sundays were of II class, and outranked feasts of II class, with the exception that feasts of the Lord, whether I or II class, replaced celebration of a II class Sunday on which <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> fall.|$|E

Hornbeck lived with Devlin, who presented the boy as his son. He was separated from his family for a total of four years, three months and six days, during which time the Shawn Hornbeck Foundation and Search and Rescue Team were established. Both boys were reunited with their families after their discovery.|$|E
25|$|In September 1961, American {{automotive}} designer Carroll Shelby {{wrote to}} AC asking {{if they would}} build him a car modified to accept a V8 engine. AC agreed, provided a suitable engine could be found. Shelby went to Chevrolet {{to see if they}} would provide him with engines, but not wanting to add competition to the Corvette they said no. However, Ford wanted a car that could compete with the Corvette and <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> have a brand new engine which could be used in this endeavor: the Windsor 221 in³ (3.6 L) engine – a new lightweight, thin-wall cast small-block V8. Ford provided Shelby with two engines.|$|E
25|$|The type of {{crossing}} where the crash occurred {{is known as}} an interconnected crossing {{because of the need}} to link the railroad signals to the road signals to ensure safe passage. On this particular route, bus drivers on Algonquin Road had been known to cross the tracks to stop at the line at Northwest Highway, leaving them vulnerable to passing trains if <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> still be stopped when the gates lowered. In addition, vehicle sensors were only present {{on the north side of}} the railroad tracks. Buses, trucks and other large vehicles were forced to pull through the railroad crossing in order to activate the signals at the intersection.|$|E

25|$|Surnames were {{uncommon}} {{prior to}} the 12th century, and still somewhat rare into the 13th; most European surnames were originally occupational or locational, and served to distinguish one person from another if <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> live near one another (e.g., two different people named John could conceivably be identified as 'John Butcher' and 'John Chandler'). This still happens, in some communities where a surname is particularly common, for example on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland, many residents have the family name MacLeod (son of Lewis) and so may still be known by a surname symbolising their occupation such as 'Kevin the post' and 'Kevin Handbag'.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{conditions}} of voluntarity, issuance of the deed, and leaving German territory (if applicable), were usually not fulfilled for German citizens authoritatively naturalised by the Eastern European states <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> live in after 1945. Their children gained German citizenship by jus sanguinis (RuStAG §4). Those Aussiedler of foreign citizenship but descending from ancestors holding German citizenship before 1918 (regardless of ethnicity) were granted German citizenship by the Federal Expellee Law (BVFG §6 (2)), while those Aussiedler without such German descent but of German ethnicity (to be evidenced by German culture, language, traditions, etc.) received German citizenship also (see BVFG §1 (1) No. 1).|$|E
25|$|At Jekyll's {{first meeting}} with Lutyens in 1889 she invited him to Munstead Wood, and their {{collaboration}} began. They explored the local vernacular architecture, gathering ideas {{for the construction of}} Jekyll's house. His first building for her was The Hut, a cottage built in the grounds of Munstead Wood in 1895. Jekyll used this as a workshop, and lived in it until Lutyens completed the main house in 1897. While the house was still being built, Lutyens obtained another, larger commission in Surrey, Orchards, {{as a result of his}} future clients being impressed with Munstead Wood when <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> walk past the construction site. Jekyll lived at Munstead Wood until her death in 1932.|$|E

25|$|It {{would appear}} that Gregory Cromwell, and John More, the son of Thomas More, have been wrongly assumed to have been unintelligent, simply because <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be overshadowed by their {{extraordinary}} fathers. It is evident that Cromwell's son was a capable scholar, who besides mastering Latin, French and accounting, had learned to play the lute and virginals and excelled in the outdoor pursuits of riding, hunting with the longbow and hawking. He was athletic and therefore had {{much in common with}} his older cousin, the courtier Richard Cromwell. It is apparent that Gregory Cromwell was an intelligent, well-educated and accomplished young man who must have been a source of pride to his father.|$|E
25|$|British {{historian}} Richard J. Evans {{wrote that}} although the expulsions of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe was done in an extremely brutal manner {{that could not be}} defended, the basic aim of expelling the ethnic German population of Poland and Czechoslovakia was justified by the subversive role played by the German minorities before World War II. Evans wrote that under the Weimar Republic the vast majority of ethnic Germans in Poland and Czechoslovakia {{made it clear that they}} were not loyal to the states <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> live under, and under the Third Reich the German minorities in Eastern Europe were willing tools of German foreign policy. Evans also wrote that many areas of eastern Europe featured a jumble of various ethnic groups aside from Germans, and that it was the destructive role played by ethnic Germans as instruments of Nazi Germany that led to their expulsion after the war. Evans concluded by positing that the expulsions were justified as they put an end to a major problem that plagued Europe before the war; that gains to the cause of peace were a further benefit of the expulsions; and that if the Germans had been allowed to remain in Eastern Europe after the war, West Germany would have used their presence to make territorial claims against Poland and Czechoslovakia, and that given the Cold War, this could have helped cause World War III.|$|E

On May 27, 1873, Kogălniceanu, alongside Alecsandri, Costache Negri, Petre Poni and other public figures, attended Cuza's funeral in Ruginoasa. Speaking later, he noted: [...] "Cuza has committed great errors, but [...] shall never fade out of the hearts of peasants, nor from Romania's history".|$|E

500|$|Faced {{with this}} problem, {{military}} doctrine {{had already started}} shifting away from high-altitude supersonic bombing toward low-altitude penetration. Radar is line-of-sight, so aircraft could dramatically shorten detection distances by flying close to the Earth and hiding behind terrain. Missile sites spaced to overlap in range when attacking bombers at high altitudes would leave large gaps between their coverage for bombers flying at lower levels. With an appropriate map of the missile sites, the bombers could fly between and around the defences. Additionally, early missiles generally flew unguided {{for a period of}} time before the radar systems were able to track the missile and start sending it guidance signals. With the SA-2 Guideline missile, this minimum altitude was roughly [...] Flying below this would make the bomber effectively invulnerable to the missiles, even if <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> fly into range.|$|E
500|$|Fears were {{as high as}} ever {{among the}} traumatised fire victims, fear of foreign arsonists and of a French and Dutch invasion. There was an {{outbreak}} of general panic on Wednesday night in the encampments at Parliament Hill, Moorfields, and Islington. A light in the sky over Fleet Street started a story that 50,000 French and Dutch immigrants had risen, widely rumoured to have started the fire, and were marching towards Moorfields to finish what the fire had begun: to cut the men's throats, rape the women, and steal their few possessions. Surging into the streets, the frightened mob fell on any foreigners whom <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> encounter, and were only appeased, according to Evelyn, [...] "with infinite pains and great difficulty" [...] and pushed back into the fields by the Trained Bands, troops of Life Guards, {{and members of the}} court.|$|E
500|$|During the 7th century, {{most of the}} Balkans were {{overrun by}} Slavic invasions, which left only the {{fortified}} towns and the coasts {{in the hands of}} the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire. [...] "Macedonia" [...] was then used for a new theme in the late 8th century under Irene of Athens. Geographically however it was located in Thrace and not in Macedonia, which was under the themes of Thessalonica, Strymon and other smaller commands such as Boleron or Drougoubiteia. Themes were not named geographically and the original sense was [...] "army". They became districts during the military and fiscal crisis of the seventh century, when the Byzantine armies were instructed to find their supplies from the locals, wherever <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be. Thus the Armeniac theme was considerably west of Armenia; the Thracesian Theme was in Asia Minor, not in Thrace. The Macedonian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire acquired its name from its founder, Basil I the Macedonian, an Armenian by descent, who was born in the theme of Macedonia.|$|E
