Coulson reforms his original S.H.I.E.L.D. team of May, Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, and Jemma Simmons, and they fly to the Arctic in their old mobile command base, a plane called the Bus. Their approach is detected by Hydra, who shoot down the Bus with missiles, but the team escape in a quinjet and infiltrate the base with Bakshi's help. Coulson, May, and Fitz break into the base's control rooms to steal information about Hydra leader Wolfgang von Strucker's primary headquarters in the small Eastern European nation of Sokovia, while Skye, Ward, Bakshi, and Simmons rescue Peterson and Campbell. During the rescue, Simmons attempts to kill Ward as she once promised she would, but Bakshi {{gets in the way}} and Simmons murders him instead, and Ward flees after sparing Simmons' life.|$|E

It was constructed adjacent to the North Block, where common walls were broken to provide passageways between the two buildings. As it was constructed on the ground that served as the main basketball court, the ground floor, 1st and 2nd floors were merged to provide a new basketball court, which is open <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>playground</b> on two sides.

2500|$|The {{area has}} benefitted from a strong group of volunteers {{who have done}} much to make the area safer and prettier. [...] Such {{projects}} as cleaning up and renaming Ben Kerr Lane, an annual street party on Dawson Avenue, street sales, organized pot lucks, {{not to mention a}} great number of improvements to Phin Park. [...] Phin Park has had a number of mature trees planted along its central lighted walkway, an outdoor ice rink created every winter, the placement of large boulders removed during street work, and the building of a gazebo next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>playground</b> for parents to cool off while their children play. [...] Throughout the year there are events at the park organized and paid for by the community including monthly movie nights and an excellent fireworks show on Victoria Day. [...] Another beautification project included building a small orchard and community garden area north of the Greenwood TTC yard.|$|E

2500|$|The figurehead of the Centurion, a [...] lion, was {{presented}} to the Duke of Richmond by George III when the ship was broken up. It was used for a while as an inn sign at Goodwood, but William IV asked for it from the Duke, and used it as a staircase ornament at Windsor Castle. The King later on presented it to Greenwich Hospital, with directions to place it in one of the wards, which he desired should be called the Anson Ward. It remained there until 1871 when it was removed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>playground</b> of the Naval School, where owing to the action of the weather it unfortunately crumbled to pieces. All that remained was a four-foot high lion’s paw which was eventually recognised as a piece of significant historical interest and returned to Shugborough Hall during the 1920s.

For there were pots of chrysanthemums and coloured leaves, and a big jar of berries: there were pretty little pictures on the wall, photogravure reproductions from Greuze, and Reynolds's [...] "Age of Innocence", giving an air of intimacy; so that the room, with its window space, its smaller, tidier desks, its touch of pictures and flowers, made Ursula at once glad. Here at last was a little personal touch, to which she could respond.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: <b>To</b> present <b>the</b> {{results of}} the process {{evaluation}} of <b>the</b> <b>PLAYgrounds</b> program, using <b>the</b> RE-AIM framework. Design: This study provides information regarding Reach, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance. Methods: <b>The</b> <b>PLAYgrounds</b> program promotes increasing levels of physical activity in 6 - 12 years old children and was evaluated using the RE-AIM framework in 4 intervention schools. Data collection consisted of a physical activity questionnaire with children (n= 765, Reach), SOPLAY observations (Implementation and Maintenance), questionnaires on the satisfaction of the implemented elements with teachers (n= 59) and children (n= 730, Implementation) and interviews for increased depth of information. In addition a simple counting of participating schools, describing of non-participating reasons and characteristics of the schools were documented (Adoption). Results: Reach of the target population (i. e. inactive children) was 60. 7 % (n= 464) and the target population was representative for populations in low-SES neighbourhoods. <b>The</b> <b>PLAYgrounds</b> program was adopted by 4 schools (80 %), at which 5 (from 7) program elements were successfully implemented. At 18 months follow-up, 3 of those 5 elements were completely maintained. Conclusions: Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance proved to be very high. Most likely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLAYgrounds</b> program being a complete intervention package that included financial, material, and staff support. Therefore, it is recommended to retain this high level of support when introducing <b>the</b> <b>PLAYgrounds</b> (or any other intervention) program in schools. In the future it would be recommended <b>to</b> evaluate <b>the</b> <b>PLAYgrounds</b> program on maintenance in schools where the key-person is employed at the school and funding is not available. © 2012 Sports Medicine Australia...|$|R
6000|$|But not as {{regarded}} himself, for {{although the}} new pupil had accepted his instructions with childlike submissiveness, {{and even as}} {{it seemed to him}} with childlike comprehension, he could not help noticing that she occasionally glanced at him with a demure suggestion of some understanding between them, or as if they were playing at master and pupil. This naturally annoyed him and perhaps added a severer dignity to his manner, which {{did not appear to be}} effective, however, and which he fancied secretly amused her. Was she covertly laughing at him? Yet against this, once or twice, as her big eyes wandered from her task over the room, they encountered the curious gaze of the other children, and he fancied he saw an exchange of that freemasonry of intelligence common to children in the presence of their elders even when strangers to each other. He looked forward to recess to see how she would get on with her companions; he knew that this would settle her status in the school, and perhaps elsewhere. Even her limited English vocabulary would not in any way affect that instinctive, childlike test of superiority, but he was surprised when the hour of recess came and he had explained to her in Spanish and English its purpose, to see her quietly put her arm around the waist of Matilda Bromly, the tallest girl in the school, as the two whisked themselves off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>playground.</b> She was a mere child after all! ...|$|E
