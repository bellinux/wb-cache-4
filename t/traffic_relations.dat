40|$|Abstract. Traditional {{approaches}} to optimal design andplanning of packet networks {{focus on the}} network-layer infrastructure, In this paper, we propose a new packet networkdesign and planning approach {{that is based on}} user-layer QoS parameters. Our proposed approach maps the end-user perfor-mance constrains into transport-layer performance constraints first, and then into network-layer performance constraints. Thelatter are then considered together with a realistic representation of traffic patterns at the network layer to design theIP network. Examples of application of the proposed design methodology to different networking configurations show theeffectiveness of our approach. 1 Introduction The pioneering works of Kleinrock [1] spurred many researchactivities in the field of design and planning of packet networks, and a vast literature is available on this subject. Al-most invariably, however, packet network design focused on the network-layer infrastructure, so that the designer is facedwith a tradeoff between total cost and network average performance (expressed in terms of average network-wide packetdelay, average packet loss probability, average link utilization, network reliability, etc.). This approach adopts the viewpointof network operators, who quite naturally aim at the optimization of some aggregate performance measures, that describethe general behavior of their network, averaging over all <b>traffic</b> <b>relations.</b> Of course, this approach is subject to the risk thata few <b>traffic</b> <b>relations</b> suffer unacceptable performance levels...|$|E
40|$|Maintaining the <b>traffic</b> {{connectivity}} <b>relations</b> between road features {{has always}} been a time consuming task for in-vehicle navigation, map website, and other traveling service related applications. Such a task has been commonly conducted artificially and inevitably inefficient, yet makes data quality control difficult. Considering the intrinsic rules of traffic connectivity formed by the geometrical structures, spatial and semantic relationships between road features in city road networks, an intelligent processing model is set forward in this paper for traffic connectivity automation. It is argued that traffic connectivity automation between road features is fundamentally a production system composed of the spatial and semantic relations between road features, connectivity rules and control system. With the implementation of an extendable connectivity rule set, the <b>traffic</b> connectivity <b>relations</b> between road network features are built automatically based on the spatial and semantic information of road network. The trigger concept is adopted to monitor and respond the changes in geometrical network and connectivity rules, and then dynamically updates the traffic connectivity between road network features in logical network so as to guarantee the consistence between geometrical network, connectivity rules and logical network. A series of control strategies and a conducting engine are developed to maintain the <b>traffic</b> connectivity <b>relations.</b> A case study conducted on a real road network verifies the effects of the proposed intelligent model...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUser {{equitable}} {{planning of}} public transport (PT) {{is an essential}} requirement {{in order to achieve}} an appropriate accessibility and attractiveness. PT planning requires traffic-related data (e. g. source-target relationships) which is not available in many cases. Therefore Austrian nationwide mobile network data is used for analysis of large-scale transport relations. The research project SOMOBIL deals with the derivation of methods that enable the development of user-orientated planning solutions on the basis of floating-phone data in coordination with other available transport and mobility data for a defined area of interest. Traffic relationships of the users of public transport are analysed. Within the project, the different data sources are merged. This approach allows the visualisation of <b>traffic</b> <b>relations</b> for different modes of transport. An essential task is the development of algorithms for the identification of PT passengers. With these data, planning solutions are developed according to defined requirements, differentiated by both traffic hours and user-groups. In doing so, traffic modelling as part of at least three different planning scenarios is carried out to calculate the impacts of measures in terms of shifting users between different modes of transport. Positive impacts due to this planning process can be produced in terms of optimized travel times. Recommendations are given for the planning of public transport with floating-phone data and the use of transport modelling...|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{transport}} {{is expected}} to augment over the coming years. The road will remain the dominating mode of landside transport and congestion seems {{to be likely to}} become a common status on the major European motorways. At the same time the capacity and performance of rail and inland waterways does not match the needs of shippers for many kinds of goods and <b>traffic</b> <b>relations.</b> In order to evaluate possible measures that render smoothly operating traffic feasible, models are a valid tool for testing scenarios. Currently existing “standard travel demand models” tend to refer to passenger transportation though. With its high complexity of transport devices – ranging from van to truck, from vessel to aircraft and also including rail traffic –, its multiple players and decision makers (e. g. drivers, shift managers, traffic controllers) as well as its international routings, these standard travel demand models are not able to reflect the system of commercial transport to its full extend. It is therefore {{the purpose of this article}} to reflect the current status of commercial traffic modelling and to indicate possible directions for its future development. Furthermore, it is evaluated which requirements must be met by a commercial traffic model in order to provide for valuable findings, which than can contribute towards the development of sustainable transport concepts. Commercial traffic can be divided into freight traffic and service oriented traffic. The former can be found on all local scales, while the latter is particularly relevant for metropolitan traffic. The challenge of commercial transport modelling is therefore twofold: the decision processes of the actors are complex, and little data is freely or easily available to describe these decision processes. Furthermore private traffic must be considered in the route assignment because of reflecting the entire traffic flow and the valid calculation of travel times and transport costs. The article expands upon these challenges to commercial transport modelling with a special focus on large-scale freight models. Based on the findings from this systematic analysis it is mapped out in a second step, which developments are still needed to cover the short-comings of currently existing models in regards to pan-European commercial transport modelling: In commercial transport a small number of actors commonly has a big impact on the traffic. It is difficult to define homogenous groups which are required for macroscopic modelling. The success of microscopic modelling, on the other hand, depends on detailed data on and understanding of motivations behind the actions of the diverse actors in commercial transport. It is apparent that commercial traffic modelling is far from reaching its adulthood, adolescence is just about to begin. The major issue has to be seen in data availability and data quality. This challenge calls for modelling approaches which make best use of the available data. It is, however, also clear that models based on the currently available data are limited either in scope or reliability. ...|$|E

To manage the environment and to sustain economic and social developments are {{two sides of the same}} medal, which is called 'sustainable environment'. In this article the consequences for mobility of the developments on the labour market and the emancipation of women in society are investigated. The environment imposes limitations on these mobility needs. The development of a labour market of high quality results in larger commuter distances by car and in a lesser degree by public transport. This is harmful to the environment. In general, dual earners and employed singles work closer to their homes than traditional households with only one wage-earner, which is in contradiction with the interests of the economy. Two strategic alternative solutions of the tensions between the mobility interests of the environment, dual-earning households and working singles and the labour market are elaborated. These alternatives differ in the scale on which relationships between companies, offices and households take place. What scale of physical planning meets best the needs of a 'substainable environment', is the question under discussion...|$|R

40|$|During Hellenistic and Roman times, Elaia, the harbour city {{of ancient}} Pergamon, was an {{important}} place of trade and traffic at the western coast of Asia Minor. Intense military and mercantile activities are documented by literary sources and archaeological evidences. This dissertation focuses on (I) the reconstruction of shoreline displacements; (II) the detection of sea-level fluctuations; (III) the usability {{and history of the}} three harbour sites; and (IV) the investigation of human impact on the environment since mid-Holocene times in the environs of Pergamon’s so-called “maritime satellite” Elaia. The geo-bio-archives of the area were studied using terrestrial and semi-aquatic vibracorings and geophysical exploration. Investigated sites were measured by Differential GPS. The sediments were examined using sedimentological, micropalaeontological and geochemical methods. Palynological and archaeobotanical analyses provided evidence for the former vegetation. Robust chronostratigraphies were established using radiocarbon (14 C) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating as well as archaeological dating of artefacts. The postglacial marine transgression drowned the later settled shores of the Bay of Elaia 5500 BC, reaching its maximum ca. 1 km inland around 1500 BC. Since 850 BC, increasing settlement activities in the area led to accelerated hinterland erosion, sedimentation and a seaward shift in the shoreline. The time of the Pergamenian occupation (250 BC–AD 180) is documented by intense building activities and an increased population, which is also visible in the palynolgical record. During its prime, Elaia operated three harbours: the closed harbour, the open harbour and a beach harbour. The construction of the closed harbour basin was determined by a series of interdisciplinary methods to 246 – 215 BC. Estimations of the water depths in the closed harbour basin (~ 2. 5 m in Hellenistic times) and the open harbour area (~ 1 m in Hellenistic times) led {{to the conclusion that the}} closed harbour basin could be exploited by common ship classes until AD 150. Shortly afterwards, increased siltation led to its abandonment. The closed harbour basin, which shows no signs of dredging activities, acted as a favourable sink for human waste, as evidenced by eggs of parasites, enhanced heavy-metal concentration and debris of craftsmanship. The first detection of the Black Sea dinocyst species Peridinium ponticum in the Mediterranean Sea documents <b>traffic</b> <b>relations</b> with the Black-Sea region. This is supported by archaeological finds of coins, seals and ceramics originating from abroad. Water depth in the open harbour area in front of the ship sheds was insufficient to anchor larger vessels. Thus, the ships were slipped to the ship sheds. The beach harbour in the eastern district of the city of Elaia acted as an area where foreign soldiers and merchants beached their ships and put up their camps. For the first time, a reliable regional sea-level (RSL) curve for a continental site on the Turkish Aegean coast was established using a new type of reliable sea-level index point. The curve correlates well with actual RSL curves of the nearby Aegean region; it is also in good agreement with sea-level curves derived from glacio-hydro-isostatic models. Five stages of human impact are evident over the past eight millennia. The natural vegetation (deciduous oak forests) existed before ca. 850 BC. It is followed by a degradation period caused by increased settlement activities and lumbering until around 250 BC. During Elaia’s most flourishing time, ca. 250 BC–AD 180, the human impact is on its maximum, documented by a significant vegetation change, the occurrence of human parasites, debris of craftsmanship, higher heavy metal concentrations, economic relations and intense construction activity. The siltation of the harbours in addition to the declining political importance of the city from late Roman times onwards led to its abandonment. Thus, the human impact on the environment decreased up to around AD 800. Since those days, the absence of human impact led to a new natural vegetation: pines. The climax vegetation of the period before 850 BC never re-established. To sum up, this PhD thesis is a valuable example of an interdisciplinary cooperation, focused on solving the questions dealing with shoreline displacements, sea-level studies, coastal evolution, hazards and ancient harbour research in an archaeological context...|$|E
40|$|Charging {{drivers for}} the {{congestion}} they cause {{is a well-known}} concept among economists, traffic engineers and transport professionals. Many studies have been performed to explore and better address this issue during the history of transport economics {{and in recent years}} the first congestion pricing schemes have been finally implemented in some cities (Singapore, London, Stockholm). Nonetheless, several theoretical and practical problems still restrain this measure from being widely adopted. The lack of consistency with the traffic engineering perspective and limited degree of realism represent the main theoretical limitations of traditional congestion pricing models. The public resistance and fair distribution of gains and losses are the major practical barriers to the implementation of congestion pricing schemes. In this thesis, we discuss congestion pricing models controlled by the gMFD within agent-based simulation (MATSim). With this approach we seek efficient tolling schemes from an economic and traffic perspective. Furthermore, by means of investigations of the distributional effects of the proposed schemes we look for the strategy that maximizes the social welfare and with the highest potential acceptability. In the first phase of this study, through a review of theoretical studies and real experiences we identify the main reasons behind and factors influencing public resistance to the introduction of congestion pricing measures. Particularly, the question of equity is discussed in order to derive the necessary background for the evaluation of distributional effects. A thorough review of the major congestion pricing models proposed to date is made to construct our model. The survey goes from the traditional approaches like Marginal Cost Pricing and the bottleneck model to the most recent approaches based on macroscopic traffic models. During the review we discuss the main advantages and drawbacks of each approach. In the end, we describe the concept of Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) and introduce important issues like the distribution of traffic and the phenomenon of hysteresis. The experiment is set up with MATSim to study the metropolitan area of Zurich. First, we test the consistency of simulation outputs with the traffic flow theory by playing with different parameters of the traffic model in order to obtain the most reliable result. Then, we derive and explore the main macroscopic <b>traffic</b> <b>relations</b> of the network defined by the cordon. This analysis shows the influence of distribution of traffic, expressed by the spatial spread of density, on the performance of the network. Furthermore, this property can be associated to the phenomenon of hysteresis loops. In order to account for this additional complexity, a generalized macroscopic fundamental diagram (gMFD) is experimentally derived to express the relationship between accumulation, production and spread of density. Finally, three tolling schemes differently controlled by the gMFD are designed: a uniform toll (Flat Toll) that allows the system working below the critical accumulation threshold; a time-varying toll (Step Toll) that charges drivers according to the total delay inside the cordon estimated through the gMFD; the Spread Toll that explicitly considers the question of spatial distribution of traffic inside the cordon. In particular, the Step Toll applies a charge in order to completely eliminate delay, whereas the Spread Toll penalizes users only for actual delays due to the overall increase of demand rather than clustering of congestion. By integrating different aspects like the traffic performance improvements, travel behavior responses and economic impacts we carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the schemes. In this broad appraisal framework the typical traffic enhancement measurements (heaviness of congestion, delays etc.) are combined with economic indicators such as the variation of agents’ utility. An analysis of travel behavior responses is carried out to identify the major trends associated with the tolling schemes and possible relationships with the traffic and economic impacts. Different socio-demographic groups are defined in order to evaluate the distributional impacts on inhabitants of different neighborhoods and areas, and on different trip purposes (work, home, education, shopping and leisure). Finally, considerations on the potential levels of public acceptance of the schemes are {{made on the basis of}} some indicators such as the share of winners, the average gain and loss, and the benefit-cost ratio. The proposed schemes have shown to perform differently from each other. While the Step Toll and the Flat Toll determine comparable traffic enhancements, the first one outperforms the second one in terms of economic impacts and distributional effects. The smoother adaptation of demand determined by the Step Toll is probably its strong point. The Spread Toll, which was conceived as the fairest scheme, does not produce any considerable traffic improvement and it is even detrimental from the economic perspective. As to the question of public acceptance, although the slightly lower share of winners, the Step Toll determines higher gains than the other two schemes. Hence, from a social welfare perspective (combination of efficiency and distributional impacts), the Step Toll is the best performing scheme, followed by the Flat Toll and Spread Toll. Besides these results, the investigations of macroscopic traffic properties of networks have shed light on important aspects of the traffic flow theory. First, the distribution of congestion expressed as spatial spread of density has considerable influence on the network performance. This property could be modeled in heterogeneous networks by introducing the spread as additional variable in the gMFD. Second, hysteresis loops in the MFD plane occur in presence of congestion and their pattern can be identified with the spread. Furthermore, the decrease of performance seems to be related to the frequency of loading-unloading cycles. Transport and PlanningTransport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

Source countries for identified victims of trafficking in 2008 included Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Romania, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Indonesia. Notably, Russian organized crime syndicates engage in trafficking of women for prostitution, and Russian and Ukrainian women have turned up in many European countries, including Turkey. According to reports appearing in 2006, the country was quickly becoming one of the largest markets for sex slaves from former Soviet states: [...] "Around 5,000 women, more than half from Moldova and Ukraine, are believed to be working as sex slaves across Turkey." ...|$|R

Illegal trades in Mainland Southeast Asia are numerous, highly diverse, and most likely increasingly complex. Of course, two of the most prominent illegal trades defining the area are human trafficking and drug trafficking, human <b>trafficking</b> in <b>relation</b> to the extensive regional prostitution market it feeds, with Thailand being infamous the world over for that reason; and drug <b>trafficking</b> in <b>relation</b> to opium and heroin produced in bulk within the similarly ill-famed Golden Triangle. Complexity arises from the fact that human trafficking and drug trafficking can be said to be linked in some places and to some extent, whether drug consumption by prostitutes―and by many of their clients―is concerned or whether economic havoc created by excessively brutal and rapid eradication of illicit crops pushes women into prostitution. However, as we will see, complexity is likewise increased by the fact that many other illegal trades feed off these two major trafficking activities and their existing, and sometimes congruous, networks. Some of these trades may, at some point, contribute to one another; they may also proceed, to some extent, from propitious specific regional dynamics (trafficking in drugs and arms in the context of armed conflicts for example). It is this great diversity and complexity of illegal trading across Mainland Southeast Asia that this book deals with, focusing on five of its most pervasive phenomenon: drug trafficking, human trafficking, arms trafficking, wildlife trafficking and illegal logging, and the trade in counterfeit goods and contraband...|$|R
