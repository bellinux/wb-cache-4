40|$|Traditionally the {{modified}} essay question (MEQ) paper {{has attempted to}} test problem solving and decision making based on an on-going family saga using seven or eight questions to be answered in 90 minutes. Candidates' scripts are double marked by two College examiners. This format imposes constraints on the range of questions asked and results in contrived scenarios. It is possible to be 'coached' for this and double marking is expensive in examiner time. Recent studies show that validity and reliability are improved by increasing the number and range of questions in a 'surgery type' paper. Single marking has been instituted and the MEQ paper will in future consist of 10 or more questions to be answered in 2 hours. Examiners' marking performance is monitored by senior <b>examiners.</b> <b>Technical</b> and statistical considerations are discussed, as are implications for candidates and course organizers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive {{overview of the}} institution-wide online exams service at the Swiss Federal Institute ofTechnology (ETH) Zurich. It is intended for stakeholders in faculty, administration, IT, and didactic support units who wish topromote and implement a similar service at their own institutions. Based on pedagogical and psychometric considerations, a case is made for how online exam environments can help {{to improve the quality}} of examinations in higher education bymaking performance assessments more accurate and valid, as well as more motivating and meaningful to students. Throughout the subsequent outline of the online exams service at ETH, we focus on identifying the elements critical tofulfilling these aims. This includes a discussion of the organization, development, and operation of the service and thedidactic and <b>technical</b> support for <b>examiners.</b> We provide blueprints of our online exam setups, and demonstrate how evencomplex online exam environments incorporating a mix of applications, files and websites can be made secure. The paperfinishes with a discussion and an outlook regarding our current and planned service development projects...|$|R

This stitching process might produce systematic errors; however, because the stitching algorithms of the iTero and TRIOS scanners are not known, their contribution to such errors cannot be explained. Intraoral conditions such as saliva, breathing, movement of the tongue, and limited oral space can also contribute to scanning inaccuracies. For example, {{it is difficult for}} the scanner tip to access the lower posterior areas, owing to tongue movement and limited mouth opening. Flügge et al. [32] found that intraoral scanning was less precise than extraoral model scanning, indicating that the intraoral conditions contribute to the inaccuracy of scans. The accuracy can also be affected by the <b>examiner’s</b> <b>technical</b> skill at intraoral scanning. To avoid such bias, in the present study, intraoral scans were obtained by the same examiner, who had experienced with over 100 cases of intraoral scanning. Long scanning times might induce errors in the stitching process of the captured images; the scanning times tend to decrease as the operator experience increased. In this study, the full-arch scan time for the iTero scanner was an average of 5  min, while the TRIOS scanner was an average of 4  min. However, further studies are needed to assess the scanning accuracy according to the clinician’s experience.|$|R
40|$|Exercise Physiology courses have transitioned to {{competency}} based, forcing Universities {{to rethink}} curriculum design and assessment to ensure students are competent to practice. This thesis explored {{the reasoning behind}} clinical judgment, specifically, capturing the {{factors that contribute to}} assessor decision making about students’ competency. Aims: The aims were twofold. The first was to determine the sources of variance in the examination process. The second was to document the factors impacting on examiner judgment and ratings of student performance. Methodology: Examiner judgement was explored from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective. 23 examiners viewed three video encounters of student performance on an OSCE. Once rated, analysis of variance was performed to determine where the variance in ratings was attributed. A semi-structured interview was conducted to draw out the examiners reasoning behind their ratings. Results: At a global level, analysis of variance indicated that the individual examiner had a minimal impact on the variance, with the majority of variance explained by the student performance on the task. A closer examination of the three domains indicated slightly different outcomes. The assessment of procedural skill, mimicked the global assessment ratings. For communication competency, examiners had different expectations about what they expected to observe. For <b>technical</b> competency, the <b>examiners</b> and the University they came from contributed to the majority of variance. Using qualitative analysis, five themes were identified to help explain the variance in examiner judgement. These were variable frames of reference, the use of varying inferences, variable reaction to language, varying use of the patient experience as a reference and varying levels of confidence in performing the assessment. Discussion: The major outcome from this study was that despite the documented differences in the examiner focus and judgement pathways, the ratings of student performance was relatively consistent amongst the examiners, with the differences in ratings largely attributed to the student’s varied ability. This finding was unexpected, as the examiners had diverse backgrounds, roles and experience. The thought processes behind judgement were diverse and if the qualitative results had been used in isolation, may have led to the researchers drawing conclusions that the examined performances would have yielded widely different ratings. A strength of the current study was that by combining the use of quantitative and qualitative approaches, the researchers were able to gain a more comprehensive picture of the assessment rational and impact on the ratings. Conclusion: This research was the first to explore the role of the examiner in the assessment of entry level exercise physiology competence. The examiner role is pivotal in determining graduate level student competency and ultimately the calibre of entry level exercise physiologists. This study highlighted the differences in the examiners judgement pathways but confirmed that the differences only had a small impact on the student ratings and that it was in fact the students’ ability that accounted for the variance in rating...|$|R
