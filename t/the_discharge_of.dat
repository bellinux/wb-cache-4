40|$|Abstract: The effects <b>of</b> {{resveratrol}} on <b>the</b> <b>discharges</b> <b>of</b> neurons in CA 1 area of rat hippocampal slices {{were examined}} by using extracellular recording technique. The results are as follows: (1) In {{response to the}} application of resveratrol (0. 05, 0. 5, 5. 0 µmol/L, n= 52) into the superfusate for 2 min, <b>the</b> spontaneous <b>discharge</b> rate <b>of</b> 46 / 52 (88. 5 %) neurons was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner; (2) Application of L-glutamate (0. 2 mmol/L) into the superfusate led to a marked increase in <b>discharge</b> rate <b>of</b> all 8 (100 %) slices in an epileptiform pattern. <b>The</b> increased <b>discharges</b> were suppressed by application of resveratrol (5. 0 µmol/L); (3) In 7 slices, perfusion of the selective L-type calcium channel agonist, Bay K 8644 (0. 1 µmol/L), induced {{a significant increase in}} <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> rate <b>of</b> 6 / 7 (85. 7 %) slices. <b>The</b> increased <b>discharges</b> were suppressed by application of resveratrol (5. 0 µmol/L); (4) In 9 slices, perfusion of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 50 µmol/L) into the superfusate significantly augmented <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> rate <b>of</b> 7 / 9 (77. 8 %) slices. Resveratrol (5. 0 µmol/L) applied into the superfusate reduced <b>the</b> increased <b>discharges</b> <b>of</b> all 7 / 7 (100 %) neurons; (5) In 10 units, the large-conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ channel blocker (tetraethylammonium chloride, TEA, 1 mmol/L) significantly increased <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> rate <b>of</b> 9 / 10 (90 %) slices.

5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are opportunistic predators, catching prey which drifts {{within reach}} of their tentacles. The prey is secured {{with the help of}} sticky mucus, spirocysts (non-venomous harpoon cells) and nematocysts (venomous harpoon cells). The tentacles then bend to push larger prey into the mouth, while smaller, plankton-size prey, is moved by cilia to the tip of the tentacles which are then inserted into the mouth. The mouth can stretch to accommodate large items, and in some species, the lips may extend to help receive the prey. The pharynx then grasps the prey, which is mixed with mucus and slowly swallowed by peristalsis and ciliary action. When the food reaches the coelenteron, extracellular digestion is initiated by <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> the septa-based nematocysts and the release of enzymes. The partially digested food fragments are circulated in the coelenteron by cilia, and from here they are taken up by phagocytosis by the gastrodermal cells that line the cavity.|$|E

Lettice Knollys was always close to her large family circle. Helpless at the political eclipse of her eldest son, the second Earl of Essex, she lost both him and her third husband to the executioner in 1601.

The tributaries Twomile Run, Huling Branch, and Middle Branch above the acid mine drainage have had their pH levels measured at 5.9, 5.7, and 5.5, respectively.

40|$|Interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1) is a pro-inflammatory {{cytokine}} {{that has}} been implicated in the regulation of nonrapid eye movement (nonREM) sleep. IL- 1, IL- 1 receptors and the IL- 1 receptor antagonist (ra) are present normally in discrete brain regions, including the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus and the adjoining magnocellular basal forebrain (BF). The POA/BF have been implicated in the regulation of sleep–wakefulness. We hypothesized that IL- 1 promotes nonREM sleep, in part by altering <b>the</b> state-dependent <b>discharge</b> activity <b>of</b> POA/BF neurons. We recorded <b>the</b> sleep–wake <b>discharge</b> profiles <b>of</b> 83 neurons in the lateral POA/BF and assessed the effects of IL- 1, IL- 1 ra, and IL-ra[*]+[*]IL- 1 delivered through a microdialysis probe on state-dependent neuronal discharge activity. IL- 1 decreased <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> rate <b>of</b> POA/BF neurons as a group (n [*]=[*] 55) but wake-related and sleep-related neurons responded differently. IL- 1 significantly decreased <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> rate <b>of</b> wake-related neurons. Of 24 wake-related neurons studied, 19 (79 %) neurons exhibited a greater than 20 % change in their <b>discharge</b> in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> IL- 1 during waking.

5|$|The oil-fired Turkey Point power {{stations}} were completed in 1967–68 and experienced immediate problems from <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> hot cooling water into Biscayne Bay, where the heat killed marine grasses.

5|$|The {{pelagic zone}} {{contains}} macro- and microfauna and myriad zooplankton which drift with the currents. Most {{of the smallest}} organisms are the larvae of fish and marine invertebrates which liberate eggs in vast numbers because the chance of any one embryo surviving to maturity is so minute. The zooplankton feed on phytoplankton and on each other and form a basic part of the complex food chain that extends through variously-sized fish and other nektonic organisms, which are in turn eaten by larger squids, sharks, porpoises, dolphins, and whales. Some marine creatures make large migrations, either to {{other regions of the}} ocean on a seasonal basis or up and down its vertical layers, often ascending to feed at night before descending to safety by day. Ships can introduce or spread invasive species through <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> ballast water or through the transport of organisms that have accumulated as part of the fouling community on the hulls of vessels.|$|E
5|$|The {{reduction}} of sulphur emissions {{had been an}} important factor since the station was in the design stages, as {{it was one of}} the main worries of those who protested the construction of the station. The London Power Company began developing an experimental technique for washing the flue gases in 1925. It used water and alkaline sprays over scrubbers of steel and timber in the flue ducts. The gases were subject to continuous washing, and with the presence of the catalyst iron oxide, sulphur dioxide was converted into sulphuric acid. Battersea Power Station was one of the first commercial applications of this technique in the world. This method of washing was stopped in the B Station in the 1960s, when it was discovered that <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> these products into the Thames was more harmful to the river than the gases would be to the atmosphere.|$|E
