Therefore, we investigated photogrammetrically acquired roughness information over different agricultural {{fields in the}} size of 6 – 22 m 2 and decomposed them into a dual scale process by using geostatistical techniques. For the characterization of soil surface roughness, we calculated two different roughness indices (the RMS height s and the autocorrelation length l) differing significantly for each scale. While we could relate the small scale roughness pattern clearly to the seedbed rows, the larger second scale pattern could be related to the appearance of wheel tracks of the <b>tillage</b> <b>machine</b> used. As a result, major progress was made in the understanding of the different scales in soil surface roughness characterization and its quantification possibilities...|$|E
40|$|Sheet and {{rill erosion}} has been {{identified}} as a major problem in much of the United States. The effect of soil erosion on productivity is the major concern. Off-site damage costs from soil erosion are becoming an increasing concern. This study evaluates soil conservation decisions in a farm-level framework, taking into account all relevant production constraints;The analysis uses two different model formulations to examine the problem. The first is a multiperiod linear programming model which is capable of accounting for the user cost of soil erosion. All production constraints necessary to analyze soil conservation at the farm level are included in the model. The second model is a stochastic dynamic programming model. This model is designed to determine the importance of stochastic soil erosion on the conservation decision. The model also includes <b>tillage</b> <b>machine</b> replacement decisions;The linear programming model results indicate that some conservation should be practiced on all soils in Northeastern Iowa. The major conservation practice is that of minimum tillage. The erosion productivity impact is the most important variable in determining the level of soil conservation. Factors that will impact on soil conservation are the discount rate, <b>tillage</b> <b>machine</b> type on the farm, technology, output prices, farm debt, and an off-site damage tax. The model also supplied some insights into modelling fields versus soils. Field and soil modelling can give different results if the soils in the field have very different characteristics;The dynamic programming model results indicate that the age and type of tillage machines on the farm will have a major effect on the optimum decision. Minimum tillage will be practiced on most fields, but if conventional tillage machines are on the farm, conventional tillage is likely to be practiced. Conventional tillage machines are replaced by minimum tillage machines when they are worn-out. The stochastic soil erosion in the model has no impact on the solution. Stochastic soil erosion might be important if a different objective function, such as maximizing utility, is used in the analysis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new theoretical model {{to describe the}} spatial variability in tillage forces {{for the purpose of}} fatigue analysis of <b>tillage</b> <b>machines.</b> The proposed model took into account both the variability in tillage system parameters (soil engineering properties, tool design parameters and operational conditions) and the cyclic effects of mechanical behavior of the soil during failure ahead of tillage tools on the spatial variability in tillage forces. The stress-based fatigue life approach was used to determine the life time of <b>tillage</b> <b>machines,</b> {{based on the fact that}} the applied stress on <b>tillage</b> <b>machines</b> is primarily within the elastic range of the material. Stress cycles with their mean values and amplitudes were determined by the rainflow algorithm. The damage friction caused by each cycle of stress was computed according to the Soderberg criterion and the total damage was calculated by the Miner's law. The proposed model was applied to determine the spatial variability in tillage forces on the shank of a chisel plough. The equivalent stress history resulted from these forces were calculated by means of a finite element model and the Von misses criterion. The histograms of mean stress and stress amplitude obtained by the rainflow algorithm showed significant dispersions. Although the equivalent stress is smaller than the yield stress of the material, the failure by fatigue will occur after a certain travel distance. The expected distance to failure was found to be df= 0. 825 × 106 km. It is concluded that the spatial variability in tillage forces has significant effect on the life time of <b>tillage</b> <b>machines</b> and should be considered in the design analysis of <b>tillage</b> <b>machines</b> to predict the life time. Further investigations are required to correlate the results achieved by the proposed model with field tests and to validate the proposed assumptions to model the spatial variability in tillage force...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Nowadays, {{in a lot}} of {{farm land}} due to reasons such as high density, heavy {{textured}} soils, steep terrain and a large body of water at each irrigation, rapid and complete absorption of water in the soil does not happen and runoff will be accrued. Improvement of infiltration reduces runoff and thus increases available water capacity. The main methods used to increase the infiltration area: The use of soil amendments, soil management by tillage and conservation farming. These methods may be used separately or together. Reservoir tillage is the process by which small holes or depressions are punched in the soil to prevent runoff of water from irrigation or rainfall. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop and evaluate a new reservoir <b>tillage</b> <b>machine</b> for runoff control in the fields. Materials and Methods Fabricated machine has four main units include three-point hitch, toolbar, frame and tillage unit. Tillage unit was a spider wheel with 6 arms that has 6 Wedge-shaped blades, mounted on them. Each tillage unit mounted on a frame and the frame is attached to the toolbar with a yoke. The toolbar was attached to the tractor by three-point hitch. The movement of tractor caused blades impact soil and spider wheel was rotating. Spider wheel rotation speed was depended on the forward speed of the tractor. Blades were created mini-reservoirs on the soil surface for "In situ" irrigation water or rainwater harvesting. Theoretically distance between basins, created by reservoir <b>tillage</b> <b>machine,</b> fabricated in this study was 57 and 68 cm for Arm's length of 30 and 40 cm respectively. For the construction of machine, first the plan was drawn with SolidWorks software and then the parts of the machine were built based on technical drawings. First tillage unit was constructed and its shaft was based in two bearings. Six of the arms were positioned at 60 degrees from each other around tillage units and connected by welding. For evaluation of machine performance, two factors contain of machine speed (in three levels of 5, 7. 5 and 10 km h- 1) and Arm's length (in two levels of 30 and 40 cm) were evaluated. The machine was evaluated based on a completely randomized block factorial design with three replications. Effects of these factors on depth, distance and volume of basins and runoff were evaluated. Results and Discussion Mean comparisons of depth, distance and size of reservoirs in different machine forward speed and different Arm's length are summarized in Table 1 and 2. The results showed that the effect of arm length and forward speed on changes in the depth and volume of the reservoirs were significant at the probability level of one percent but changes of the distance between the reservoirs was only affected by Arm's length. The results also showed that increasing the forward speed from 5 to 10 km h- 1 and increase the Arm's length from 30 to 40 cm increased depth, distance and volume of reservoirs. Reservoir tillage practices were control runoff in all plots. Conclusions In this research project, a reservoir <b>tillage</b> <b>machine</b> was built and assessed. Tillage unit of this machine is similar to the spider wheel. By this machine the small holes generated in the ground periodically. For evaluation of machine performance, effect of two factors, including machine speed and arm's length on depth, distance and volume of the basins were evaluated. The results showed that increasing the ground speed from 5 to 10 km h- 1 and increase the arm's length from 30 to 40 cm increased depth, distance and volume of reservoirs.

However, in order to obtain more objective estimation data for the used tractor aggregates, their performance should be evaluated by optimal parameters: their working width and their speed. One of the ways how to raise labour efficiently, to cut the fuel consumption and the production costs, as well as to improve the ecological situation is to improve the tractor loading and aggregation patterns. Only those aggregates should be used for soil tillage and other works which ensure its performance with minimum fuel consumption and costs.

40|$|Introduction Improving the {{efficiency}} of all agricultural operations has always been important for farmers and engineers. It {{is well known that}} the force required for cutting a soil using narrow blades is a function of soil and environmental physical properties, tool shape geometry and the tool’s surface characteristics like soil-tool adhesion and friction. Soil tool adhesion can reduce ploughing efficiency and quality. It may also halt the movement of <b>tillage</b> <b>machines</b> in more severe conditions. Adhesion can also disable some machine abilities, which can result in a significant reduction of machine performance. Adhesion of the soil to seed-bed preparation tools like furrowers can significantly affect the germination rate. Reducing soil tool adhesion of furrowers can reduce draft force and improve ploughing efficiency. Many researchers have worked on methods of reducing draft force by modifying the surface material and/or surface texture of the plough tools. A good prediction on draft force of a tool before producing it has always been important for farmers and engineers. There are some models for predicting the draft force of narrow blades in soil. McKyes-Ali’s model is widely used because of its accuracy and simplicity. Ultra-high molecular weight polythene (UHMW-PE) is a polymer with ultra-high weight and long molecular chains and is well known for its outstanding physical and chemical properties and self-cleaning abilities, which reduce soil-tool adhesion. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate usability of UHMW-PE coated furrower tines for draft force. Analytical and experimental investigations were carried out during the research. A comparison was conducted between the analytical and the experimental method. The results of this comparison can be used to determine reliability of the analytical model for predicting the draft force improvement caused by the surface modification on tines using different surface coatings. Materials and Methods Eight tines have been built. Four of them had a thick coating layer of UHMW-PE, and the other four were made of pure mild steel. Each set of the tines have been installed on a four shanked chisel plough chassis and then attached to a tractor. The draft force required for pulling the furrowers attached to the tractor has been measured by a simple load meter mechanism connecting two tractors. Draft force has been measured in two different speeds. Slip ratio of the tractor has been recorded. Each test has been repeated three times. McKyes-Ali’s proposed model for evaluating the draft force of narrow blades has been chosen to predict draft force of the traditional steel furrower tines and the surface coated ones. To drive the model, a computer program has been coded in the script environment of Matlab software. The model required some of the mechanical properties of the soil and the tool to operate. Specific gravity, cohesion and internal friction angle of the soil have been measured by routine laboratory methods. Soil-tool adhesion and friction of the mild steel and the UHMW-PE plates have been measured using the direct shear apparatus. Results and Discussions MkKyes-Ali’s model has predicted draft forces with an accuracy of 90...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{includes}} {{the results of}} determination of Atterberg plasticity limits of arable (0 - 25 cm) and subarable (25 - 50 cm) horizons in 53 pseudogley profiles from the community of Ub. On the basis of performed laboratory investigations, {{it has been found}} that the pseudogley belongs to the group of moderately plastic soils, with plasticity index higher than 17. In the arable horizon, average moisture at the plastic limit is about 20 %, and in the subarable horizon - about 19 %. Average values of the liquid limit in the arable horizon are about 38 %, and in the subarable horizon about 40 %. The optimal moisture for <b>machine</b> <b>tillage</b> of the investigated pseudogley and for other field operations varies between 19 and 22 %. Several other physical and textural characteristics are presented, including clay activity index and potential mechanical instability and soil susceptibility to treading...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the relationship between farm size and energy productivity of wheat production in west Azerbaijan province, Iran. Farmers with different farm sizes (less than two hectares, between two and five hectares and more than five hectares) were randomly selected. Questionnaires were filled by 61 farmers. Then total used energy, produced energy, energy productivity and energy ratio were calculated for each farm. Also the relationship between energy indexes and three methods of tillage and planting (combination machine, seed drill and seed spreader) and three harvesting methods (combine harvester, mower and hand tools) were calculated. The data were analyzed by SPSS software. The results showed that fertilizers (43 %) and machinery (40 %) was the maximum portion of total used energy on farm. There was no significant linear relationship between the farm size and energy indexes. There was no significant relationship between energy indexes and harvesting methods. But there was a significant relationship between tillage and planting methods and energy indexes. Results showed that tillage and planting methods such as combination <b>tillage</b> and planter <b>machine</b> application increases the effect of farm size on energy indexes...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Nowadays, {{agricultural}} {{systems are}} seeking economic, ecological and bioenvironmental goals for production of agricultural crops with protection and sustainability of the environment. Therefore, there is need to extend sustainable agricultural {{systems such as}} conservation agriculture. One {{of the principles of}} conservation agriculture is conservation tillage. Conservation tillage is a kind of tillage that retains crop residues on the soil surface or mixes it with soil using related machines. It could also affect on machine performance parameters. Energy consumption for producing one kilogram crop could be studied for conservation tillage. Several researchers have conducted studies on this issue for production of different crops including wheat, sunflower and forage crops. This study conducted to assess machine performance parameters and energy indices of conservation tillage systems for soybean cultivation in Golestan province. Materials and Methods This study was conducted to investigate the effects of conservation <b>tillage</b> systems on <b>machine</b> performance and energy indices in soybean production at the Gorgan research station of Golestan Agricultural and Natural Resource Research Center in 2012. The precipitation was 450 mm. Soil texture was silty clay loam. Treatments were four tillage methods, including no-till using row crop direct planter, no-till using grain direct drill, conventional tillage usin a disk harrow with working depth of 10 - 15 cm and minimum tillage using chisel packer with a working depth of 20 cm. Machine performance parameters and energy indices studied in a farm covered by wheat residues in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four treatments and four replications. Machine performance parameters consisted of field efficiency, field capacity, total field capacity and planting uniformity index were measured. Energy indices such as energy ratio, energy productivity, energy intensity and net energy gain were also calculated. Results and Discussion The results showed that no-tillage methods by grain drill and row crop planter had the lowest field efficiency (56...|$|R
