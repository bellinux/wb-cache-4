40|$|A reverse phase {{stability}} indicating HPLC method for simultaneous determination of two antispasmodic drugs in pharmaceutical parenteral dosage forms (injectable) and in serum {{has been developed}} and validated. Mobile phase ingredients consist of Acetonitrile[*]:[*]buffer[*]:[*]sulfuric acid 0. 1 [*]M (50 [*]:[*] 50 [*]:[*] 0. 3 v/v/v), at flow rate 1. 0 [*]mL/min using a Hibar Î¼Bondapak ODS C 18 column monitored at dual wavelength of 266 [*]nm and 205 [*]nm for phloroglucinol and <b>trimethylphloroglucinol,</b> respectively. The drugs were subjected to stress conditions of hydrolysis (oxidation, base, acid, and thermal degradation). Oxidation degraded the molecule drastically while there {{was not so much}} significant effect of other stress conditions. The calibration curve was linear with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9999 and 0. 9992 for PG and TMP, respectively. The drug recoveries fall in the range of 98. 56 % and 101. 24 % with 10 [*]pg/mL and 33 [*]pg/mL limit of detection and limit of quantification for both phloroglucinol and <b>trimethylphloroglucinol.</b> The method was validated in accordance with ICH guidelines and was applied successfully to quantify the amount of <b>trimethylphloroglucinol</b> and phloroglucinol in bulk, injectable form and physiological fluid. Forced degradation studies proved the stability indicating abilities of the method...|$|E
