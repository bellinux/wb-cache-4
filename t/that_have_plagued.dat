He covered such {{a wide range of}} topics according to his political arithmetic method, i.e. like modern economists, he set out to prove his claims by finding data and statistics, rather than relying on anecdotal evidence. He wrote rigorously, but also with concision and humour. The issues that Petty thought about and wrote are major topics <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> the minds of economic theorists ever since.|$|E

25|$|The bridge {{superstructure}} {{is designed}} to withstand shipping accidents and the natural disasters <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> Charleston’s history. The span {{is designed to}} endure wind gusts in excess of 300mph (480km/h), far stronger {{than those of the}} worst storm in Charleston's history, Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Engineers also considered the 1886 earthquake that nearly leveled Charleston. The Ravenel Bridge is designed to withstand an earthquake of approximately 7.4 on the Richter magnitude scale without total failure. To protect the bridge from errant ships, the towers are flanked by one-acre rock islands. Ships will run aground on the islands before colliding with the towers.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{dangerous}} forms of wine fraud is when producers add hazardous materials such as lead(II) acetate ("sugar of lead"), diethylene glycol, and methanol to wine in order to increase sweetness. Some chemicals may be used to mask other wine faults and unpleasant aroma. Government authorities, such as the European Union and the American Food and Drug Administration, across the globe have set up laws and regulations of acceptable chemicals that can be added to wine in order to avoid some of the scandals <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> certain wine producing countries in the 20th century.|$|E

500|$|PC Zone said, [...] "It's hard, {{its opening}} acts don't match {{the quality of}} those which follow and some {{characters}} grate—but as a modern rendition of a traditional formula, The Angel Of Death has both pointed and clicked wisely. It's another nail out of the adventure gaming coffin—although admittedly quite a few remain." [...] Adventure Classic Gaming said, [...] "Not only the game succeeds in addressing many of the flaws in Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> the previous title, this sequel is able to surpass the high standard and expectation set forth by past games in the series to create yet another chapter in {{the legend of the}} Knights Templar." [...] Eurogamer said, [...] "As an example of classic, back to basics point and click adventuring, there can perhaps be no finer recent example in the genre than The Angel of Death—it's a nailed-down must-buy if you're an adventure diehard who plays every one." ...|$|E

Club reviewer Myles McNutt praised the episode and the introduction of the special projects plotline, comparing it to the third season arc featuring Jim in Stamford, Connecticut, and the [...] "Michael Scott Paper Company" [...] arc from the fifth season. He praised the episode for feeling [...] "like a big answer to many of the issues <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> the show so far this season", specifically pointing to Dwight's meta-commentary on Cathy's [...] "lack of personality". He moreover wrote that he was {{looking forward to the}} rest of the season and the change in dynamic. Despite this, he criticized Dwight's role in the episode, comparing his orientation to Michael's conference room lectures and wrote he had a [...] "distaste" [...] for the broader moments for the character. He ultimately gave the episode an A-, his highest grade for an eighth-season episode.|$|E

Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone noted [...] "the album de-emphasizes the (very) guilty pop pleasures of her 2004 debut {{in favor of}} leaden I-hate-you-Daddy laments such as [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart" [...] and [...] "My Innocence". Entertainment Weekly writer Leah Greenblatt commented that [...] "it's {{hard to imagine a}} more explicit snapshot of the highly publicized family problems <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> the star than [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)"". PopMatters's Whitney Strub said [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] "immediately commences with a line about 'wait for the postman to bring me a letter', which suggests songwriters dipping into the well of cliché without worrying about freshness," [...] while commenting that [...] "the world might not need another version of Britney Spears' 'E-Mail My Heart', but good lord, that song came out in 1999. Perhaps a text-message might arrive faster than snail-mail in late 2005, should Lohan's song-persona deign to enter the 21st century".|$|E
500|$|Peter and Olivia (Anna Torv) {{are sent}} by Walter {{to observe the}} {{building}} as he monitors seismic equipment from the lab. Peter and Olivia go to a bar while waiting, where Olivia tries to kiss Peter but becomes uncomfortable, knowing {{of the influence of}} her parallel universe doppelganger, Fauxlivia (Torv), on Peter. Her emotional reaction triggers her ability to see once again the [...] "shimmer" [...] around Peter that marks him [...] as a native of the parallel universe. She excuses herself and steps outside for some fresh air, followed by Peter. Olivia notices a similar glow emanating from the windows of apartment 6B in the Rosencrantz building, owned by the widow Mrs. Alice Merchant (Phyllis Somerville). When Olivia and Peter enter the apartment, Olivia (but not Peter) can see a shimmering figure that Alice claims is the ghost of her late husband Derek (Ken Pogue). Walter surmises that the figure is a parallel Derek seen across a crack between the universes. If the crack widens, Walter predicts they would see occurrences of the same singularities <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> the parallel universe, and suggests the use of the same amber-like compound they had previously recovered ("The Ghost Network") to limit the damage. With Massive Dynamic's resources, they are able to recreate the amber and a release system to encase the building, but hold it in reserve as a last resort only.|$|E

The Objectivist continued publishing with Rand as editor and Leonard Peikoff as associate editor. Peikoff also took over Nathaniel Branden's role as the primary lecturer on Objectivism.

2500|$|At Headingley on the 1981 tour of England, Australia {{was in such}} {{a strong}} {{position}} at one stage of the third Test that bookmakers at the ground were offering odds of 5001 on an England victory. These odds were flashed on the scoreboard during a break in the game and noticed by the Australian players. Lillee and Rod Marsh believed that the odds were so ludicrous that, via a third party, they each put a small wager on the outcome, later describing their actions as a [...] "joke". Between them, they collected 7,500 pounds when England pulled off a comeback victory. Both men openly discussed the incident and received no official censure or sanction, although some criticised their actions. There has never been a suggestion that the bets compromised their efforts in the game. However, the issue has been re-examined in modern times following the match-fixing scandals <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> international cricket since the mid-1990s.|$|E

2500|$|Less {{impressed}} was GameSpot, who {{awarded the}} GameCube version 6.5 out of 10 and the PS2 version 5.4. They found the technical {{issues of the}} game to be too significant; [...] "Bounty Hunter suffers from an array of technical problems <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> other third-person action games. You can move the camera perspective using the right analog stick, but the camera will still cause you some major headaches when in tight corridors or when trying to draw a bead on a specific enemy. Often it'll automatically swivel to point you in entirely the wrong direction. Clipping and collision-detection issues also abound." [...] They also criticized the graphics and the overall gameplay, concluding that [...] "Star Wars Bounty Hunter may have all the basic ingredients needed for a solid third-person action game, but it falls flat in the execution and is far too often cumbersome, confusing, or {{in some other way}} un-fun to be recommendable on its own merits. Serious Star Wars aficionados should enjoy the game's story, but they'll be forced to slog through a lot of tedious action to see how it pans out." ...|$|E
