Secondly, I will refer to and consider two theories; one by John Locke and the other by Prof. Ichinose. Finally, I will attempt to justify <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body as private property in regards to organ transplants and brain death. In conclusion, I think <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body as private property, relating to organ transplants and brain death, is a Humanities issue, and bereaved families may exercise organ transplant <b>rights</b> in <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> a brain dead individual...|$|R
