50|$|This council, the Sixth Ecumenical Council, met from 680 to 681. It hosted {{representatives from}} the Pope and <b>the</b> <b>Patriarchs</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria and Jerusalem, while <b>the</b> <b>Patriarchs</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople and Antioch were present in person. It unanimously, with the {{exception}} of two individuals, condemned the Monotheletic doctrine and the Type of Constans.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Latin <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Jerusalem is also {{considered}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patriarchs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east. However, his church follows the Latin Rite and his patriarchal title {{derives from the}} historical importance of the see rather than the autonomy of his church.|$|R
5|$|At this point, again {{according}} to his own account, he felt remorse and considered returning to Constantinople, where he would give the fortune he had amassed to the poor, but he was forestalled by the Bishop of Tyre and Sidon, who found him and delivered an offer by <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Antioch to name him bishop of Taurezion (an unidentified location, suggested as being either in the Taurus Mountains or in the Tauric peninsula, i.e. the Crimea). Paul accepted, and was apparently consecrated by the Bishop of Tyre and Sidon (ca. 1375). At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople Philotheos I Kokkinos heard about his dealings in the east, and at Trebizond Paul was met by a messenger from the Patriarch who demanded his immediate return to Constantinople to stand trial.|$|E
5|$|Conflict {{among the}} Christian {{population}} of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis {{was within the}} Palaestina Prima province {{under the rule of}} the Byzantine Empire. The tension was a result of Monophysite Christian attempts to prevent the return of <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Jerusalem, Juvenal, to his episcopal see. However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife.|$|E
5|$|From Forum Iulii, Alboin next reached Aquileia, {{the most}} {{important}} road junction in the northeast, and the administrative capital of Venetia. The imminent arrival of the Lombards had a considerable impact on the city's population; <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Aquileia Paulinus fled with his clergy and flock to the island of Grado in Byzantine-controlled territory.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Chalcedon <b>the</b> <b>patriarchs</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople remained in communion with <b>the</b> non-Chalcedonian <b>patriarchs</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, while Rome remained out of communion with them, and in unstable communion with Constantinople. It was not until 518 that the new Byzantine Emperor, Justin I (who accepted Chalcedon), demanded that the Church in the Roman Empire accept the Council's decisions. Justin ordered the replacement of all non-Chalcedonian bishops, including <b>the</b> <b>patriarchs</b> <b>of</b> Antioch and Alexandria. The extent {{of the influence of}} the Bishop of Rome in this has been a matter of debate.|$|R

5|$|In 1907, Khrimian {{clarified}} {{the relations}} between <b>the</b> <b>patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople and emphasized {{the primacy of the}} see of Echmiadzin. In September of that year he sent a letter to Nicholas II in which he called upon the Russian government to prevent the violence then facing the Ottoman Empire's Armenian population.|$|E
5|$|This was a {{recognition}} of the de facto political situation, as <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople was partially under the political control of the Ottoman Empire. However, faithful people—concerned that having a Catholic {{as the head of the}} Church of Greece would weaken the Orthodox Church—criticised the unilateral declaration of Autocephaly as non-canonical. For the same reason, they likewise resisted the foreign, mostly Protestant, missionaries who established schools throughout Greece.|$|E
5|$|While the {{religious}} hierarchy mirrored the Empire's administrative divisions, the clergy were more ubiquitous than the emperor's servants. The issue of caesaropapism, while {{usually associated with}} the Byzantine Empire, is now understood to be an oversimplification of actual conditions in the Empire. By the fifth century, <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople was recognized as first among equals of the four eastern Patriarchs and as of equal status with the Pope in Rome.|$|E

5|$|As the {{population}} of German settlers in the region began to increase, the desire for Lutheran religious services and education also grew. Ministers, including Henry Muhlenberg disciple Christian Streit, began to establish congregations in the largest communities of western Virginia. Muhlenberg was a German pastor, requested by colonists in Pennsylvania, {{who served as a}} missionary there from 1742 until his death in 1787; he is considered <b>the</b> <b>patriarch</b> <b>of</b> the Lutheran Church in the United States. Johannes Schwarback and Muhlenberg's son, Peter, reportedly visited the Cacapon River Valley between 1763 and 1776 (before Hebron Church's founding). Streit, charged with ministering to a Lutheran congregation in Winchester, settled there on July 19, 1785.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time rebellions began in Roman Syria and Palaestina Prima in the wake of Heraclius' revolt. In 609 or 610 <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Antioch, Anastasius II, died. Many sources claim that the Jews were {{involved}} in the fighting, though it is unclear where they were members of factions and where they were opponents of Christians. Phocas responded by appointing Bonus as comes Orientis (Count of the East) to stop the violence. Bonus punished the Greens, a horse racing party, in Antioch for their role in the violence in 609.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Zara Yaqob also {{continued}} as the defender of <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria. When he heard in 1441 {{of the destruction}} of the Egyptian monastery of Debre Mitmaq by Sultan Az-Zahir Sayf-ad-Din Jaqmaq, he called for a period of mourning, then sent a letter of strong protest to the Sultan. He reminded Jaqmaq that he had Muslim subjects whom he treated fairly, and warned that he had the power to divert the Nile, but refrained from doing so for the human suffering it would cause. Jaqmaq responded with gifts to appease Zara Yaqob's anger, but refused to rebuild the Coptic Churches he had destroyed.|$|E

5|$|However, Alexios's {{problems}} were only just beginning. At {{a time when}} the Emperor urgently needed to raise as much revenue as possible from his shattered empire, taxation and the economy were in complete disarray. Inflation was spiralling out of control, the coinage was heavily debased, the fiscal system was confused (there were six different nomismata in circulation), and the imperial treasury was empty. In desperation, Alexios had been forced to finance his campaign against the Normans by using the wealth of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which had been put at his disposal by <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|However, Ober Ost, the German {{military}} administration, {{rejected the}} changes. On January 26, {{in compliance with}} the earlier request, the two versions of the notification were approved, but they did not include the changes of January 8. The texts were prepared based on the Act of December 11. These concessions to the Germans created tensions among the council members. Four members – Mykolas Biržiška, Steponas Kairys, Stanisław Narutowicz and Jonas Vileišis – resigned from the Council in protest. Chairman Antanas Smetona, who supported the Act of December 11, stepped down. Jonas Basanavičius, who would later be called <b>the</b> <b>patriarch</b> <b>of</b> independence, was elected chairman.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1895, on the orders of <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Karlovci, Georgije I, the Congress Board of Sremski Karlovci {{commissioned}} the young realist Paja Jovanović to paint Migration of the Serbs, intending {{for it to be}} displayed as part of the Serb pavilion. Georgije had originally approached the artist Uroš Predić, but Predić said it would take him two years to complete the painting. Jovanović assured the Patriarch that he could finish the work in eight months. The painting was one of two works that Jovanović was hired to paint for the Exhibition, the other being the Vršac triptych, which was commissioned by the Vršac city council.|$|E

5|$|Justinian {{entered the}} arena of ecclesiastical statecraft shortly after his uncle's {{accession}} in 518, {{and put an end}} to the Acacian schism. Previous Emperors had tried to alleviate theological conflicts by declarations that deemphasized the Council of Chalcedon, which had condemned Monophysitism, which had strongholds in Egypt and Syria, and by tolerating the appointment of Monophysites to church offices. The Popes reacted by severing ties with <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople who supported these policies. Emperors Justin I (and later Justinian himself) rescinded these policies and reestablished the union between Constantinople and Rome. After this, Justinian also felt entitled to settle disputes in papal elections, as he did when he favoured Vigilius and had his rival Silverius deported.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Theodore's background; he is {{recorded}} as being born a Roman, {{and the son of}} Photios I of Constantinople, who was <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople. His brother Theodosius (or Theosius) was also a bishop. He was ordained as a priest by Stephen V. The exact dates of his papal reign are unknown, but modern sources generally agree that he was pope for twenty days during December 897. Flodoard, a tenth-century French chronicler, only credited Theodore with a twelve-day reign, while in his history of the popes, Alexis-François Artaud de Montor listed Theodore's reign as being twenty days, from 12 February to 3 March 898.|$|E
5|$|Maximus' {{refusal to}} accept Monothelitism {{caused him to}} be brought to the {{imperial}} capital of Constantinople to be tried as a heretic in 658. In Constantinople, Monothelitism had gained the favor of both the Emperor and <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople. Maximus stood behind the Dyothelite position and was sent back into exile for four more years. During his trial he was accused of aiding the Muslim conquests in Egypt and North Africa, which he rejected as slander.|$|E
