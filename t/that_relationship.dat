5|$|Despite {{its role}} in {{establishing}} the General Synod, the Pennsylvania Ministerium withdrew from the inter-Lutheran organization in 1823. Within the Ministerium, there was a close relationship between Lutheran and Reformed congregations, and many felt that the General Synod might jeopardize <b>that</b> <b>relationship.</b> In addition, many in the Ministerium were wary of a centralized organization, and the control that it might exert over individual congregations.|$|E
5|$|Mazatec shamans have a {{long and}} {{continuous}} tradition of religious use of Salvia divinorum, using it to facilitate visionary states of consciousness during spiritual healing sessions. Most of the plant's local common names allude to the Mazatecs' post-Columbian belief that the plant is an incarnation of the Virgin Mary, with its ritual use also invoking <b>that</b> <b>relationship.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima {{stresses}} {{the dynamic of}} players' relationships with the main character in Final Fantasy games; thus, he puts significant thought into how <b>that</b> <b>relationship</b> will develop. With Final Fantasy VII, protagonist Cloud Strife's reserved nature led Nojima to include scenarios in which the player can select Cloud's responses to certain situations and dialogue. With Final Fantasy VIII, which also features a reserved lead protagonist in Squall, Nojima wanted to give players actual insight into what the protagonist is thinking, even while other characters remain uninformed: {{this led to the}} inner dialogues Squall has through the game.|$|E

40|$|We build {{a simple}} model to show <b>that</b> <b>relationships</b> and high-powered formal {{contracts}} {{can be either}} substitutes or complements, depending on the relative impact of relationships on incentive problems and contracting costs. Empirically, in the offshore drilling industry we find that oil and gas companies {{are less likely to}} choose high-powered fixed-price contracts as the intensity of their relationships with drillers increases. This supports the conclusion <b>that</b> <b>relationships</b> and formal contracts are substitutes in this setting, indicating <b>that</b> <b>relationships</b> reduce incentive problems more than contracting costs. We further test the effect of relationships on different types of wells that differ in the severity of their contracting costs and incentive problems, and find results consistent with our theory...|$|R

In all first-class cricket, Crawford scored 9,488 runs at an average of 32.60 and took 815 wickets at an average of 20.66. Although he continued to play cricket at a lower level, the remainder of Crawford's life passed in relative obscurity.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosaurids {{share many}} {{features}} with early birds (clade Avialae or Aves). The precise {{nature of their}} relationship to birds has undergone {{a great deal of}} study, and hypotheses about <b>that</b> <b>relationship</b> have changed as large amounts of new evidence became available. As late as 2001, Mark Norell and colleagues analyzed a large survey of coelurosaur fossils and produced the tentative result that dromaeosaurids were most closely related to birds, with troodontids as a more distant outgroup. They even suggested that Dromaeosauridae could be paraphyletic relative to Avialae. In 2002, Hwang and colleagues utilized the work of Norell et al., including new characters and better fossil evidence, to determine that birds (avialans) were better thought of as cousins to the dromaeosaurids and troodontids. A consensus of paleontologists has concluded that there is not yet enough evidence to determine whether any dromaeosaurids could fly or glide, or whether they evolved from ancestors that could.|$|E
5|$|Symeon {{taught that}} putting oneself under the {{guidance}} of a spiritual father was essential for those who were serious about living the spiritual life. <b>That</b> <b>relationship</b> was a historical tradition especially prominent among the Desert Fathers, who defined the qualifications for acting in the role of a spiritual father: personal experience; an interior life; purity of heart; the vision of God; insight; inspiration; discernment. Official ordination as a priest was not a requirement—Symeon's own spiritual father was a simple unordained monk who had many spiritual children. Symeon also taught that such teachers were empowered by their holiness to preach and to absolve others of their sins, a view that brought him into disagreement with church leaders of his time.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{stories in the}} Confucian {{tradition}} that demonstrate <b>that</b> one's <b>relationship</b> with one's parents is to be prioritized over any legal obligations to the state. One prominent example claims that it is morally preferable to cover up one's father's wrongdoings rather than turn {{him over to the}} authorities. In this paper, I make use of several key concepts from John Searle's theory of the construction of social reality in order to posit an explanation for this prioritization in Confucian thought. I argue <b>that</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>that</b> are grounded by the brute fact of biology, such as relationships of kin, have a component <b>that</b> purely institutionalized <b>relationships,</b> such as <b>that</b> between citizen and state, lack. I also argue that the particular brute fact of biology <b>that</b> grounds familial <b>relationships</b> is a permanent one, whereas <b>relationships</b> <b>that</b> are strictly institutional are subject to change. I then use these two claims to show why it is justifiable to place greater loyalty with <b>relationships</b> <b>that</b> cannot be changed. Finally, I argue that the same justifications can be used to defend the Confucian notion that all parents are owed filial piety, regardless of whether they are particularly good parents or not...|$|R
