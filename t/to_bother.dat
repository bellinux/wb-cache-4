5|$|The {{story line}} took on many forms during production. His {{original}} idea featured a 30-year-old man dealing with monsters that he {{drew in a}} book as a child coming back <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> him as an adult. Each monster represented a fear he had, and conquering those fears caused the monsters eventually to disappear.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Heidelberg, Goebbels {{wrote his}} {{doctoral}} thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz, a minor 19th century romantic dramatist. He {{had hoped to}} write his thesis {{under the supervision of}} Friedrich Gundolf, who at that time was a well known literary historian. It did not seem <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. However, Gundolf was no longer performing teaching duties, so he directed Goebbels to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Waldberg was also Jewish. It was Waldberg who recommended Goebbels write his thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, Goebbels earned his PhD in 1921.|$|E

5|$|In 1255 Saka, Permana Dikoesoemah is the King of Galuh, {{beloved by}} {{his people and}} his wife Naganingroem. The {{minister}} Aria Kebonan wants power for himself, and persuades the king to surrender the crown to him. Permana Dikoesoemah warns Aria Kebonan to respect him always and not <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> his wife. He then abdicates to meditate, ultimately ascending to a higher plane of existence. Aria Kebonan, meanwhile, magically gains the king's appearance, ensuring {{that the people of}} Galuh are unaware that they have a new king.|$|E
5|$|Motley's knees {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> him in 1952. While {{he showed}} occasional signs {{of his old}} form that season, {{it became clear to}} the Browns' coaching staff that he was no longer in his prime. Motley finished the year with 444 yards of rushing and 4.3 yards per carry, a career low. The Browns finished with an 8–4 record but still captured the conference title and secured another spot in the NFL championship game. Motley performed well in that matchup against the Detroit Lions, rushing for 95 yards. The Browns, however, lost 17–7.|$|E
5|$|Pliny the Elder in his Natural History and Varro related {{that the}} Romans {{did not begin}} to cut their hair short until barbers were {{introduced}} to Italy from Sicily by P. Ticinius Mena in 299 BC. Women in Roman times valued long hair, usually with a center part. Apart from in the earliest times, men's hair was usually shorter than women's, although other cultures of the time, such as Greeks in the east, considered long hair to be typical of philosophers, who {{were thought to be}} too engrossed in learning <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> with hair. Strictly in the province of Rome, however, the shorter hairstyle was especially popular. When Julius Caesar conquered the Gauls, who favored long hair, he ordered it to be cut short.|$|E

5|$|Coach Perkins met {{for several}} hours with Oklahoma linebacker Brian Bosworth, who entered a {{supplemental}} draft after being kicked off of the Oklahoma team. Perkins and Bosworth were impressed with each other, but the rights to select were awarded lottery-style, and the first selection went to the Seattle Seahawks. The Seahawks drafted Bosworth despite his having sent them a letter telling them not <b>to</b> <b>bother.</b> He expressed a preference {{to play for the}} Buccaneers. When the Indianapolis Colts failed to sign linebacker Cornelius Bennett, the second player selected in the draft (directly after Testaverde), they attempted to trade him to Tampa Bay. Perkins had previously coached Bennett at Alabama, but the Colts, looking for extra draft picks to trade to the Los Angeles Rams to get running back Eric Dickerson, wanted two draft picks in return for Bennett. Perkins felt that this price was too steep. Perkins also attempted to persuade Bo Jackson, their first-overall pick from the 1986 NFL Draft who had refused to sign with the Buccaneers, to change his mind and join the team.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, without resigning from Parliament, Kent Hughes {{rejoined the}} Army, {{becoming}} a {{colonel in the}} 8th Division. He served in the Malaya campaign of 1942, where he was again mentioned in despatches. Kent Hughes was taken prisoner by the Japanese in Singapore and was kept in the Changi Prisoner Of War camp, where he was beaten and half-starved. In 1943 he was shipped as a slave labourer to Taiwan. In October 1944 he was shipped to Japan and on to Korea, and then sent by rail to Mukden in Manchuria, where prisoners of war were put to work in arms factories. In August 1945 Kent Hughes was liberated by the invading Red Army and returned to Australia with an amoebic complaint that would continue <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> him. While imprisoned, Kent Hughes secretly wrote what became Slaves of the Samurai, a colourful account of his wartime experiences, published in 1946. He also took up the case of Australian General Gordon Bennett, {{who was accused of}} cowardice and desertion after leaving Singapore without authorisation shortly before the city surrendered to the Japanese. Kent Hughes appeared before the Royal Commission into Bennett's case, and argued that Bennett was correct to avoid being taken prisoner and return to Australia to continue the fight.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 2015, Barea re-signed {{with the}} Mavericks to a four-year, $16 million contract. On December 23, 2015, Barea scored a career-high 32 points on 13-of-20 {{shooting}} in a 119–118 overtime {{win over the}} Brooklyn Nets. Three days later, he made a career-high seven three-pointers and finished with 26 points in a 118–111 win over the Chicago Bulls. On March 30, 2016, he scored 26 points and made the go-ahead layup with 49.9 seconds left as the Mavericks rallied {{in the fourth quarter}} to beat the New York Knicks 91–89. On April 6, he helped the Mavericks win their fifth straight game, recording game highs of 27 points and 8 assists in an 88–86 victory over the Houston Rockets. Having become the Mavericks' sparkplug late in the season with Deron Williams sidelined, Barea suffered his own injury on April 8, a right groin strain which forced him to leave the game against the Memphis Grizzlies after just eight minutes. The groin injury continued <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> him {{for the rest of the}} regular season and into the Mavericks' first round playoff series with the Oklahoma City Thunder.|$|E

5|$|The {{briefing}} {{process was}} repeated {{with a second}} group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six {{were found to be}} over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. Since this was more than expected, NASA decided not <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> with the remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six. Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the Lovelace Clinic and the Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory. Only one candidate, Jim Lovell, was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and the diagnosis was later found to be in error; thirteen others were recommended with reservations. The director of the NASA Space Task Group, Robert R. Gilruth, found himself unable to select only six from the remaining eighteen, and ultimately seven were chosen.|$|E

25|$|Persons {{who keep}} their own surname after {{marriage}} {{do so for}} a number of reasons. Objection to the inequality of the tradition is one major reason. Some people are the last ones in the family with that surname. Others don't want <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> with the paperwork. Common reasons for maintaining their birth name include not wanting to lose their identity, preferring their last name to their spouse's last name, and fear of professional ramifications.|$|E

25|$|Jones {{remained}} with the Browns in 1948 {{as the team}} went undefeated and won the title {{for the third time}} in a row. He scored two touchdowns in the championship game. In a 1949 game against the Los Angeles Dons, Jones suffered a broken collarbone and missed the remainder of the regular season. The Browns again reached the championship, and Jones returned to play in the game, which Cleveland won for the fourth straight time. His shoulder continued <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> him, however, and he decided to retire after the season.|$|E

While he secured the deal, the time spent and an unforeseen delay meant his sub-team was late back to the boardroom and fined 25% of their sales, losing the team the task.|$|E
25|$|He had a {{dream of}} his own death {{and his mother had}} the same dreams.

All objects made this vow except mistletoe—a detail which has traditionally been explained with the idea that it was too unimportant and nonthreatening <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> asking it to make the vow, but which Merrill Kaplan has instead argued echoes the fact that young people were not eligible to swear legal oaths, which could make them a threat later in life.|$|E

25|$|After graduating, Stevenson {{conducted}} research in biochemistry. His first residency {{was at the}} Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal (1944–1945), but his lung condition continued <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> him, {{and one of his}} professors at McGill advised him to move to Arizona for his health. He took up a residency at St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona (1945–1946). After that, he held a fellowship in internal medicine at the Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation in New Orleans, became a Denis Fellow in Biochemistry at Tulane University School of Medicine (1946–1947), and a Commonwealth Fund Fellow in Medicine at Cornell University Medical College and New York Hospital (1947–1949). He became a U.S. citizen in 1949.|$|E
25|$|Cast threads {{in metal}} parts may be {{finished}} by machining, {{or may be}} left in the as-cast state. (The same can be said of cast gear teeth.) Whether or not <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> with the additional expense of a machining operation depends on the application. For parts where the extra precision and surface finish is not strictly necessary, the machining is forgone in order to achieve a lower cost. With sand casting parts this means a rather rough finish; but with molded plastic or die-cast metal, the threads can be very nice indeed straight from the mold or die. A common example of molded plastic threads is on soda (pop) bottles. A common example of die-cast threads is on cable glands (connectors/fittings).|$|E
25|$|Leicestershire {{prevailed in}} a match at Old Trafford where 726 runs were scored in four {{completed}} innings and Leicestershire's young bowler Stuart Broad and captain HD Ackerman starred. Leicestershire chose to bat {{after winning the}} toss, and were taken apart by Glen Chapple and Murali Kartik, who shared nine wickets, while the highest partnership for Leicestershire was worth 53. The lack of veteran bowler Dominic Cork did not seem <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> Lancashire unduly, as Chapple got five wickets for 22 runs and Kartik four for 43. Only Jon Maunders and HD Ackerman passed 20 for the visitors, {{and they were all}} out for 165. Lancashire accumulated runs slowly, and their score was 61 for 2 at the close of play on the first day. With Mal Loye out with an injury, Lancashire posted 191, Maunders taking four for 28 and Stuart Broad three for 57 to limit Lancashire's lead to 26 runs. An opening partnership of 63 saw Leicestershire take the lead, but spinners Murali Kartik and Andrew Symonds took two wickets each, while the three seamers Chapple, Sajid Mahmood and Anderson took one each to round off the day. Ackerman was left overnight on 37 - 11 short of the highest score in the match so far.|$|E
