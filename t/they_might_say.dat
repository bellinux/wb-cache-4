500|$|Astral Weeks {{influenced}} future {{releases of}} other musicians such as Bono and Bruce Springsteen. Mike Ragogna with The Huffington Post wrote that Astral Weeks influenced Springsteen's 1973 first album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. {{and two of}} the songs from his second. Steven Van Zandt, from Springsteen's E Street Band, has said: [...] "Astral Weeks was like a religion to us." [...] According to writer Steve Turner, the album also became popular with travelers of the hippie trail, [...] "from Europe through to Kathmandu and there were even reports of vans painted in psychedelic colours being renamed 'the Van Morrison'." [...] In his 1975 book, Ritchie Yorke wrote [...] "It was almost as if Van Morrison, elusive at any time, had deliberately created an album of music which would indefinitely withstand the vulgarity of music industry image-making. Later <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that other albums were reminiscent of Astral Weeks, but they could never claim that Astral Weeks was like anything else." ...|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of using}} {{multitrack}} recording (which was quickly gaining popularity), the Allman Brothers Band opted to cut most of Idlewild South live, {{with all of}} the musicians performing together. On rare occasions, they would go back to overdub sections that weren't up to standard. [...] "The idea is that part of the thing of the Allman Brothers is the spontaneity — the elasticity. The parts and tempos vary in a way that only they are sensitive to", said Dowd. Duane often left a song alone for more work and testing out on the road. [...] "They would record maybe five songs. Then <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> 'I don't think that song was good enough,' or, 'I don't think that song was ready to record,", remembered Dowd. Joel Dorn, predominantly a jazz producer for Atlantic, stepped in to produce one song on the album, [...] "Please Call Home", which was recorded at Regency Sound Studios on July 14, 1970. The band were in New York at the time and Dowd was unavailable.|$|E

60|$|But Mr Melmotte {{would not}} rise again. He {{had made a}} great effort, and had at any rate {{exhibited}} his courage. Though <b>they</b> <b>might</b> all <b>say</b> {{that he had not}} displayed much eloquence, they would be driven to admit that he had not been ashamed to show himself. He kept his seat till the regular stampede was made for dinner, and then walked out with as stately a demeanour as he could assume.|$|R

5000|$|In Bulgarian legends, it is {{said that}} if you walk beneath a rainbow, you will change genders: if a man, you'll begin to think like a woman, and if a woman, you'll begin to think like a man. While most Bulgarians don't believe in the superstition, some of them tease each other and joke around. <b>They</b> <b>might</b> also <b>say</b> [...] "The sun is shining, the rain is falling, a bear is getting married" [...] (roughly translated-in the {{original}} verse, the last part rhymes).|$|R

60|$|It seems a pity that comedy should {{disappear}} from among us. If it depend entirely on swords and snuff-boxes, {{would it not}} be worth the while of the Society of Authors to keep a few gentlemen specially trained? Maybe some sympathetic theatrical manager would lend us costumes of the eighteenth century. We might provide them with swords and snuff-boxes. <b>They</b> <b>might</b> meet, <b>say,</b> once a week, in a Queen Anne drawing-room, especially prepared by Gillow, and go through their tricks. Authors seeking high-class comedy might be admitted to a gallery.|$|R
40|$|Of Looms and Lilies is {{an artistic}} {{investigation}} of the proliferation of material wealth generated by the industrial revolution {{and its effect on}} both our personal and spiritual lives and its wider impact on climate change.

"Good God, {{how much}} more happily would those learned men then live, than now they do! with {{how much more}} {{assurance}} of their salvation! and, in the hour of death, when {{they are ready to}} stand forth before the dreadful judgment-seat, how much greater reason would they have, to hope well of God's eternal mercy, because <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> O Lord, thou hast given me five talents, and behold I have added other five.|$|E
60|$|When we came alongside, a low cry ran {{fore and}} aft the deck, and {{everybody}} gazed at us with inquiring eyes. And well <b>they</b> <b>might.</b> To <b>say</b> nothing of the savage boat's crew, panting with excitement, all gesture and vociferation, my own appearance was calculated to excite curiosity. A robe of the native cloth was thrown over my shoulders, my hair and beard were uncut, and I betrayed other evidences of my recent adventure. Immediately on gaining the deck, they beset me on all sides with questions, the half of which I could not answer, so incessantly were they put.|$|R
60|$|So we fell to it, {{one against}} three, {{for the space}} of above three hours. They have left upon me, as you see, some of the marks of their valour, and have also carried away with them some of mine. They are but just now gone.

60|$|Tim did not {{propose to}} {{start for the}} Run until his companions had {{concluded}} their business; his goods were packed ready for removal, {{and there was nothing}} better for him to do than accompany them to the court-room where it seemed as if all <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> would result only in a long term of imprisonment for Hazelton before he could be tried on the baseless charge brought against him, simply because of the disreputable business in which he was engaged.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can keep}} her from {{slipping}} back," [...] Tommy still replied. The doctor marvelled, but even {{he did not know}} the half of all her husband did for Grizel. None could know half who was not there by night. Here, at least, was one day ending placidly, <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> when she was in a tractable mood,--so tractable that she seemed to be one of themselves,--and Tommy assented brightly, though he knew, and he alone, that you could never be sure the long day had ended till the next began.|$|E

"Besides," [...] he said, {{pursuing}} {{his argument}} {{in his tone}} of light-hearted conviction, [...] "if I don't go anywhere for pain--which would be a perversion of the intention of my being, and a monstrous thing to do--why should I go anywhere to {{be the cause of}} pain? If I went to see our young friends in their present ill-regulated state of mind, I should give them pain. The associations with me would be disagreeable. <b>They</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> 'This is the man who had pounds and who can't pay pounds,' which I can't, of course; nothing could be more out of the question! Then kindness requires that I shouldn't go near them--and I won't." ...|$|E

If they had fired a shot, we should of course be justified in killing them; but were we to begin the shooting, the whole tribe they belong to would take it up, and there would be a cry for vengeance; and even if nothing were done at once, we should be marked down to be wiped out at the first opportunity.|$|E
60|$|Ruth obeyed her father, and {{was no more}} seen {{about with}} George Forester; but she {{believed}} no tale to his disadvantage, and when at times she met with him accidentally, she told him frankly enough that though her father didn't like her going about with him, she loved him and meant to love him always, whatever <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>say.</b> Upon all other points her father's will was law to her, but upon this she was firm; and two years afterwards, when some words young Forester had spoken at a public-house about his daughter came to his ears, Hiram renewed the subject to her, she answered staunchly that unless he gave his consent she would not marry George Forester, but that nothing would make her give him up or go back from her word.|$|E
6000|$|A revered fetish of the Americans was [...] "freedom of speech": it was {{believed}} that if bad men were permitted to proclaim their evil wishes they would go no further in the direction of executing them--that if <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> what they would like to do they would not care to do it. The close relation between speech and action was not understood. Because the Americans themselves had long been accustomed, in their own political debates and discussions, to the use of unmeaning declamations and threats which they had no intention of executing, they reasoned that others were like them, and attributed to the menaces of these desperate and earnest outcasts no greater importance than to their own. They thought also that the foreign anarchists, having exchanged the tyranny of kings for that of majorities, would be content with their new and better lot and become in time good and law-abiding citizens.|$|E

40|$|Riots. Revolts. Revolution. All {{flashing}} moments which {{throw the}} world – and {{our relationship with}} to it – into question. From the uprising against the Russian Czar one hundred years ago, to the Arab Spring and protests against war, austerity and the continuing failure of politics, people have pinned their hopes on radical political change, on turning worlds upside down. But all too often the ever-renewed dream of changing {{the world for the}} better has ended either in failure or has been crushed. This pop up exhibition, for three weeks only, explores these moments of destabilization, crisis, and renewal. Included are Cairo based Mosa’ab Elshamy’s photographs from the 2011 – 2013 revolt in Egypt, the Justseeds’ Celebrate People’s History poster series, and David Mabb’s ‘Long Live the New! Morris & Co, Hand Printed Wallpapers and K. Malevich’s, Suprematism’. Each communicates or represents moments of upheaval. How do these histories resonate with each other? What can we learn from them? What <b>might</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> to each other? And how <b>might</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> it today, as political communication shifts from print materials to digital and social medi...|$|R
