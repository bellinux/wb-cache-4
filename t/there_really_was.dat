500|$|The Harrier II Plus is {{very similar}} to the Night Attack variant, with the {{addition}} of an APG-65 multi-mode pulse-Doppler radar in an extended nose, allowing it to launch advanced beyond-visual-range missiles such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM. To make additional space for the radar, the angle-rate bombing system was removed. The radars used were taken from early F/A-18 aircraft, which had been upgraded with the related APG-73. In addition to the AIM-120, the AV-8B Plus can also carry AGM-65 Maverick and AGM-84 Harpoon missiles. According to aviation author Lon Nordeen, the changes [...] "had a slight increase in drag and a bit of additional weight, but <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> not much difference in performance between the [...] Night Attack and radar Harrier II Plus aircraft".|$|E
500|$|Studios Hergé serialised Tintin in Tibet weekly from September 1958 to November 1959, {{two pages}} per week, in Tintin magazine. Because {{of his desire}} for accuracy, Hergé added the logo of Air India to the {{airliner}} crash debris. A representative of Air India complained to Hergé about the adverse publicity the airline might suffer, arguing, [...] "It's scandalous, none of our aircraft has ever crashed; you have done us a considerable wrong." [...] Air India had cooperated with Hergé, aiding his research by providing him reading material, contemporary photographs, and film footage of India and Nepal, particularly Delhi and Kathmandu. While the crashed aircraft's tail number remained [...] "VT", the country code for Indian aircraft, Hergé agreed to change the airline logo in the published edition to the fictional Sari-Airways, dryly noting that {{there were so many}} Indian airlines it was possible that <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> a Sari-Airways.|$|E

2500|$|Associate Justice Pierce Butler filed a dissenting opinion, {{joined by}} Associate Justice James McReynolds, {{in which he}} argued the {{majority}} had engaged in judicial activism. He asserted the majority had completely rewritten the two questions presented in the petition for certiorari as a constitutional question, when <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> no constitutional issue.

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{remarkable}} side of Sheehan was his vision of a reorganised Irish society which he hoped would take shape in an Independent Ireland. His nationalism was neither exclusively Gaelic nor Catholic and best portrayed by him in his novel The Intellectuals (1911), whose archetypical characters of man and women of Catholic and Protestant background from Ireland, England and Scotland, meet to discuss current issues of the day, Sheehan in the preface saying [...] "that his object was to show that <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> no invincible antagonism amongst {{the people who make}} up the commonwealth of Ireland that may not be removed by a freer and kindlier intercourse with each other".|$|E
2500|$|Attorney {{and author}} Mark Lane {{said that he}} interviewed several jurors after the trial. Although these {{interviews}} have never been published, Lane said {{that some of the}} jurors believed that Garrison had in fact proven to them that <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy, but that Garrison had not adequately linked the conspiracy to Shaw or provided a motive. Author and playwright James Kirkwood, who was a personal friend of Clay Shaw, said that he spoke to several jury members who denied ever speaking to Lane. Kirkwood also cast doubt on Lane's claim that the jury believed there was a conspiracy. In his book American Grotesque, Kirkwood said that jury foreman Sidney Hebert told him: [...] "I didn't think too much of the Warren Report either until the trial. Now I think a lot more of it than I did before...." ...|$|E
