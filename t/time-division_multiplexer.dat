40|$|Abstract—Two {{thin-film}} microelectrode arrays with integrated circuitry {{have been}} developed for extracellular neural recording in behaving animals. An eight-site probe for simultaneous neural recording and stimulation has been designed that includes on-chip amplifiers that can be individually bypassed, allowing direct access to the iridium sites for electrical stimulation. The on-probe ampli-fiers have a gain of 38. 9 dB, an upper-cutoff frequency of 9. 9 kHz, and an input-referred noise of 9. 2 V rms integrated from 100 Hz to 10 kHz. The low-frequency cutoff of the amplifier is tunable to allow the recording of field potentials and minimize stimulus arti-fact. The amplifier consumes 68 W from 1 5 V supplies and oc-cupies 0. 177 mm 2 in 3 m features. In vivo recordings have shown that the preamplifiers can record single-unit activity 1 ms after the onset of stimulation on sites as close as 20 m to the stimulating electrode. A second neural recording array has been developed which multiplexes 32 neural signals onto four output data leads. Providing gain on this array eliminates the need for bulky head-mounted circuitry and reduces motion artifacts. The time-division multiplexing circuitry has crosstalk between consecutive channels of less than 6 % at a sample rate of 20 kHz per channel. Ampli-fied, time-division-multiplexed multichannel neural recording al-lows the large-scale recording of neuronal activity in freely be-having small animals with minimum number of interconnect leads.

A further stage of WDM-to-TDM signal conversion was used to map the resulting signal back into the time domain.

The horns are arranged in a hexagonal array and feed a polarimeter which uses finline-coupled TES bolometers as detectors. To detect the two polarizations the 97 -GHz telescope has 320 detectors while the 150 and 220 -GHz telescopes have 512 detectors each. To achieve the target NEPs (1. 5, 2. 5, and 4. 5 x 10 ^- 17 W/rtHz) the detectors are cooled to 100 mK for the 97 and 150 -GHz polarimeters and 230 mK for the 220 -GHz polarimeter. Each detector is fabricated as a single chip to ensure a 100 % operational focal plane. The detectors are contained in linear modules made of copper which form split-block waveguides.

40|$|CLOVER aims {{to detect}} the {{signature}} of gravitational waves from inflation by measuring the B-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background. CLOVER consists of two polarimeters. One operates at 97 GHz, using finline-coupled Transition Edge Sensors (TES). The other has a combined 150 / 220 -GHz focal plane populated by radial-probe coupled TES detectors. The 97 -GHz instrument will have 100 feedhorns and 200 detectors while the combined 150 and 220 -GHz instrument will have a total of 200 horns. To achieve the target NEP of 1. 5 x 10 - 17 W Hz- 1 the 97 -GHz detectors will have a transition temperature of 190 mK and will operate with a base temperature of ∼ 100 mK. CLOVER's detectors are fabricated on 225 -micron silicon substrates. In the 97 -GHz instrument a finline transition feeds a microstrip which is terminated by a matched resistor on the silicon nitride island that carries the TES. Each detector is fabricated as a single chip to ensure a 100 % operational focal plane. The detectors are mounted in linear modules made of copper which form split-block waveguides. Each detector module contains a <b>time-division</b> SQUID <b>multiplexer</b> to read out the detectors. The multiplexed signals are further amplified by SQUID series arrays.

40|$|The future Internet {{traffic growth}} will require {{deployment}} of optical transmission systems with bit rates higher than rate of currently available 40 -Gb/s systems, such as 100 -Gb/s and above. However, at data rates beyond 100 -Gb/s the signal quality is significantly degraded mainly due to impact of polarization mode dispersion (PMD), and intra-channel nonlinear effects. All electrically <b>time-division</b> multiplexed (ETDM) <b>multiplexers</b> and de-multiplexers operating at ~ 100 -Gb/s are becoming commercially available. However, the modulators operating ~ 100 -Gb/s are not widely available so that alternative approaches to enable 100 -Gb/s transmission and beyond using commercially available components operating at 40 -Gb/s are of high practical importance. In this invited paper, several joint coded-modulation and multiplexing schemes enabling beyond 100 -Gb/s transmission using commercially available components operating at 40 -Gb/s are presented. Using this approach, modulation, coding and multiplexing are {{performed in a}} unified fashion so that, effectively, the transmission, signal processing, detection and decoding are done at much lower symbol rates, where dealing with the nonlinear effects and PMD is more manageable, while the aggregate data rate is maintained above 100 -Gb/s.
