25|$|The diocesan bishop {{appoints}} a vicar {{general to}} assist him in the governance of the diocese. Usually, only one vicar general is appointed; particularly large dioceses may {{have more than one}} vicar general. The vicar general or one of them is usually appointed moderator of the curia who coordinates the diocesan administrative offices and ministries. A diocesan bishop can also appoint one or more episcopal vicars for the diocese. They have the same ordinary power as a vicar general, however, it is limited to a specified division of the diocese, to a specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> to the faithful of a particular rite, or to certain groups of people.

500|$|Organized {{areas of}} {{thunderstorm}} activity not only reinforce pre-existing frontal zones, {{but they can}} outrun cold fronts. This outrunning occurs in a pattern where the upper level jet splits into two streams.
