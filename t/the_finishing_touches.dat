5|$|After Michael France {{delivered}} the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine {{was brought in}} to rewrite it. Caine kept many of France's ideas but added the prologue prior to the credits. Kevin Wade polished the script and Bruce Feirstein added <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>touches.</b> In the film, the writing credit was shared by Caine and Feirstein, while France was credited with only the story, an arrangement he felt was unfair, particularly as he believed the additions made were not an improvement on his original version. Wade did not receive an official credit, but was acknowledged in the naming of Jack Wade, the CIA character he created.|$|E
5|$|Kumar {{requested}} Nagarjuna a year's time {{to complete}} and provide <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> to the script. The latter read the script to director K. Raghavendra Rao, who suggested Kumar develop a simpler version, as the original was too complicated. The rewritten version was read to Nagarjuna in {{two and a half}} hours and to Nageswara Rao over six hours, as the latter wanted every detail to be clear. Due to the complex nature of the second half, the latter suggested Kumar to add a comedy plotline between grandfather and grandson. After its incorporation into the script, and after considering the titles Hum and Trayam, Manam was chosen as the film's title on Nageswara Rao's suggestion.|$|E
5|$|In November 1956, while {{staying in}} Paris, he was {{reminded}} of trunks he had stored in the Ritz Hotel in 1928 and never retrieved. Upon re-claiming and opening the trunks, Hemingway discovered they were filled with notebooks and writing from his Paris years. Excited about the discovery, {{when he returned to}} Cuba in early 1957, he began to shape the recovered work into his memoir A Moveable Feast. By 1959 he ended a period of intense activity: he finished A Moveable Feast (scheduled to be released the following year); brought True at First Light to 200,000 words; added chapters to The Garden of Eden; and worked on Islands in the Stream. The last three were stored in a safe deposit box in Havana, as he focused on <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> for A Moveable Feast. Author Michael Reynolds claims it was during this period that Hemingway slid into depression, from which he was unable to recover.|$|E

5|$|The {{portion of}} NY252 in Henrietta between Marketplace Drive and Ridgeland Road was widened {{from four to}} six lanes {{as part of a}} multi-year, $15.6million project that began in mid-2009. Phase one of the five-phase project, {{completed}} {{during the second half of}} 2009, involved the relocation of utility poles and water mains. The next four phases involved the actual widening of the highway. During phase two, all traffic on Jefferson Road was routed along the eastbound lanes while the westbound half of the road was reconstructed and widened; this was reversed during phase three. A raised median between the two directions, which prohibited left-hand turns at all points except signalized intersections, was constructed during phase four, and phase five covered <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> of the project. As part of the project, the intersection between Jefferson Road and East Henrietta Road (NY15A) was widened to have two dedicated left turn lanes in all four directions. Work on the last four phases began on March29, 2010, and was expected to be fully completed in November 2011. Construction did get completed in November 2011, but at the cost of $16.5million (2012USD) instead of the original $15.6million.|$|E

25|$|From Senafe, Merewether {{sent out}} two letters from Lieutenant-General Napier: one to Emperor Tewodros, {{demanding}} {{the release of}} the hostages (which Rassam intercepted and destroyed, afraid this ultimatum might enrage Tewodros against the prisoners); the other to the people of Ethiopia, proclaiming that he was there purely to free the captives and that he had hostile intentions only towards those who sought to oppose him.

25|$|In February 1996, the Billboard posted {{information}} that singer was putting <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> {{to her new}} studio album, I'm Movin' On, slated for its release in May. Judging from the magazine’s earlier preview of several cuts, Billboard published that Peniston was about to explore more mature jeep-soul fare a la Faith Evans, and that she has never sounded so assured and convincingly soulful. Though I'm Movin' On with a noticeably slimmed-down Peniston adorning its cover was not released until September, a similarly sleek sound marked its title single delivered to the radio stations on July 17, while hitting music stores one week later.|$|E
25|$|I {{believe that}} it is one of my strong collaborations. It already has me worried about the future. This is my best moment now, as far as the match I have musically with Sakis. Without wanting to put down all the people I have collaborated with I adore them like, ex, Giorgos Mazonakis. The people who go to see Sakis musically are very close to me, in {{relation}} to those who go to see a laïko artist. The track was recorded sometime in late November at Kontopoulos' studio, coinciding with the artists' busy rehearsal schedule for The S Club. Before its release, Tamta had not heard the final result as Kontopoulos and Rouvas were in the studio up until the song's release working on <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>touches.</b>|$|E

Then on Indy's ensuing drive, Damien Robinson intercepted a pass from Manning and returned it 24 yards to the Colts 36-yard line. New York then drove 64 yards in 13 plays, 11 of them runs by Jordan for 59 yards, including a 1-yard touchdown run to make the final score of the game 41-0.

25|$|Nicolae Iorga {{was forced}} out of Bucharest (where he owned {{a new home in}} Dorobanți quarter) and Vălenii de Munte by the massive {{earthquake}} of November. He then moved to Sinaia, where he gave <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> to his book Istoriologia umană ("Human Historiology"). He was kidnapped by a Guardist squad, the best-known member of which was agricultural engineer Traian Boeru, on the afternoon of November 27, and killed in the vicinity of Strejnic (some distance from the city of Ploiești). He was shot at some nine times in all, with 7.65mm and 6.35mm handguns. Iorga's killing is often mentioned in tandem with that of agrarian politician Virgil Madgearu, kidnapped and murdered by the Guardists on the same night, and with the Jilava Massacre (during which Carol II's administrative apparatus was decimated). These acts of retribution, placed in connection with the discovery and reburial of Codreanu's remains, were carried out independently by the Guard, and enhanced tensions between it and Antonescu.|$|E

25|$|The film's {{special effects}} were {{completed}} by seven different visual effects houses: Digital Domain, Giant Studios, The Third Floor, MPC, Soho VFX, Rodeo FX and Hatch Productions. Creating the giants took four main steps. The {{first step was}} Pre-Capture, in which performance capture was used to capture the actor's facial and body movements and render them in a real-time virtual environment. The second step took place during principal photography, where Simulcam technology was used to help the human characters virtually interact with the giants that were rendered earlier in Pre-Capture. The third step was Post-Capture, a second performance capture shoot to adjust giants' movements to seamlessly fit the live-action performances. The final step involved putting <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> on the giant's animation, skin, hair and clothing, and composition in the shots. Creating the beanstalk involved two main requirements: set extension for shots of the actors interacting with the beanstalk, which were shot against a bluescreen, and complete CG renderings for shots of the beanstalk growing and extending from Earth {{into the world of}} the giants.|$|E
25|$|When the U.S. {{government}} {{moved back}} to Philadelphia in 1790, the city, {{in an attempt to}} convince the federal government not to move to Washington, was determined to provide luxurious accommodations at Congress Hall, the recently constructed building where Congress was to meet. One of <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> was in June 1791, when a large Axminster carpet was installed in the Senate's upper-floor chamber. The central design was the U.S. coat of arms, complete with the constellation of 13 stars, surrounded by the linked shields of all thirteen states. Under the arms, there was also a pole with a liberty cap and a balance of justice. The carpet was 22 by 40 feet, and was made by William Peter Sprague, an Englishman from Axminster (probably trained under Thomas Whitty) who had set up a factory in Philadelphia. The carpet was not brought to Washington, D.C., when the government moved in 1800, and is long lost. The National Park Service had a reproduction made in 1978 as part of the restoration of Congress Hall; they had to speculate on the exact design of the eagle and chose the representation seen on the first seal die.|$|E
25|$|Washington {{began its}} {{schedule}} {{of spring training}} games on February 25 with three straight road games. With construction crews still putting <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> on the stadium during the morning, the Nationals and Astros opened the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches with their first game there on February 28, with the Nationals playing as the home team at the shared facility. Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred cut a ceremonial ribbon, and a helicopter flyover {{took place during the}} opening ceremonies. Before a crowd of 5,897, Nationals non-roster invitee Jeremy Guthrie threw the first pitch at 1:07p.m. EST, to Astros first baseman Marwin González, whom he eventually struck out. In the bottom of the first inning, second baseman Daniel Murphy doubled for the first hit in the ballpark′s history, and a few minutes later scored its first run when right fielder Bryce Harper doubled to drive him home. In the top of the fourth inning, Astros designated hitter Carlos Beltrán hit the stadium′s first home run, and catcher Derek Norris hit the first Nationals home run in the park′s history {{in the bottom of the}} fourth. With two outs in the bottom of the ninth, outfielder Michael A. Taylor hit a walk-off solo home run to give the Nationals a 4-3 victory in their first game at their new spring training home.|$|E
