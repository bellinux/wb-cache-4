5|$|Workmen {{discover}} a pre-human skull while {{building in the}} fictional Hobbs Lane (formerly Hob's Lane, Hob being an antiquated name for the Devil) in Knightsbridge, London. Dr Matthew Roney, a paleontologist, examines the remains and reconstructs a dwarf-like humanoid with a large brain volume, which he believes to be a primitive man. As further excavation is undertaken, something <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> missile is unearthed; further work by Roney's group is halted because the military {{believe it to be}} an unexploded Second World War bomb.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} of the season six finale, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) are desperately {{attempting}} to find the truth behind the so-called alien object. Meanwhile, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is still imprisoned by his own frenetic brain activity. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Skinner are unaware of FBI Special Agent Diana Fowley's (Mimi Rogers) duplicity—she is working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). Scully then travels to Africa to unravel the secrets of the alien artifacts, finding something <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> spaceship buried under the shoreline off the Côte d'Ivoire coast. The object may prove that life originated elsewhere, and all religion is based on the Navajo contact with alien life. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder in Washington, D.C., but instead she finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner. Cigarette Smoking Man has taken Mulder to a place where all his problems seem to have disappeared. Fowley helps Scully locate Mulder, which leads to her death at the hands of Cigarette Smoking Man.|$|E

5|$|Many brick {{structures}} {{have been}} located at Kaveripumpattinam during on-shore, near shore and off-shore explorations; these provide proof for building construction during Sangam age. The on-shore structure include an I-shaped wharf and a structure <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> reservoir. The wharf {{has a number}} of wooden poles planted in its structure to enable anchorage of boats and to facilitate the handling of cargo. Among other structures, there is a Buddhist vihara with parts of it decorated using moulded bricks and stucco. Near shore excavations yielded a brick structure and a few terracotta ring wells. Off-shore explorations located a fifteen course brick structure, three courses of dressed stone blocks, brick bats and pottery. At Arikamedu, there were indications of a structure built substantially of timber, possibly a wharf. Conical jars that could have been used for storing wine and oil have been found near structures that could have been shops or storage areas. Evidence of continued building activity are present at this site, with the most distinctive structures being those of a possible warehouse, dyeing tanks and lined pits.|$|E

25|$|The limpkin (Aramus guarauna), {{also called}} carrao, courlan, and crying bird, is a bird <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> large rail but is skeletally closer to cranes. It {{is the only}} extant species in the genus Aramus and the family Aramidae. It is found mostly in {{wetlands}} in warm parts of the Americas, from Florida to northern Argentina. It feeds on molluscs, with the diet dominated by apple snails of the genus Pomacea. Its name derives from its seeming limp when it walks.|$|E
25|$|Brown recluse spiders {{are usually}} between , but may grow larger. While {{typically}} light to medium brown, they range in color from whitish to dark brown or blackish gray. The cephalothorax and abdomen {{are not necessarily}} the same color. These spiders usually have markings on the dorsal side of their cephalothorax, with a black line coming from it <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> violin with the neck of the violin pointing {{to the rear of the}} spider, resulting in the nicknames fiddleback spider, brown fiddler, or violin spider.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Bill Corbett {{and fellow}} writer Rob Greenberg wrote the {{screenplay}} for Meet Dave, a family comedy starring Eddie Murphy about a tiny Star Trek-like crew operating a spaceship <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man. The {{captain of the}} crew and the spaceship were both played by Murphy. Originally conceived as a series called Starship Dave for SciFi.com, it was dropped in favor of Edward the Less. The script (along with the title) were changed drastically by studio executives and other writers, although Corbett and Greenberg received sole screenwriter credit.|$|E

25|$|Anioma social {{structure}} {{is dominated by}} the use of lineages which are based loosely on the concept of uno, eboh', and idumu, which are major blood lineages; while ogbe and obodo are open and much more political. Uno is a small family unit comprising husband, wife, and children. The next lineage was Eboh, which includes the primary or nuclear family, the daughter or son in law, and the grandparents and the grandchildren. The Ogbe is a large structure which allowed non-blood relatives; it comprises the Idumu and some outsiders and it is best classified as a quarter in terms of demographics. The maximal concept is one <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> small town; this is the Obodo.|$|E
25|$|Introduced {{in chapter}} six, {{he prefers to}} be called Joseph, and is known also as the Wandering Jew, or the “Magician of the Flow”, he is a mysterious being <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> young boy, but is much older. A long time ago, people said that “God’s Son” cast an immortal curse on him. Holding no clear intention, he’s just a monster that simply does what he feels like. He seems to travel around the world experimenting with the living and dead {{for the sake of}} his experiments, {{although}} he has apparently forgotten why he experiments. He has the appearance of a human but the body of a non-human – as seen in chapter eleven when he was struck with a magic bullet. He dislikes his “Cartaphilius” name.|$|E
25|$|The Kushan Empire era {{statues of}} Kartikeya, dated to 1st and 2nd-century CE, {{have been found}} at various sites in the Indian subcontinent, {{particularly}} at Mathura and Gandhara. They show him as a warrior dressed in dhoti (sheet wrapped at waist, covering the legs), armour like a warrior, spear {{in his right hand}} and a bird (rooster) in his left. There is some difference between his ancient iconography in Mathura and Gandhara artwork. The Gandhara arts show him in more a Scythian dress, likely reflecting the local dress culture prevalent in those times. Further, it is in the oldest Gandharan statues where he is shown with a bird <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> chicken or cock. According to Richard Mann, the bird may symbolize Kartikeya's agility and maneuverability as a warrior god, and may be a Parthian influence. His iconography symbolizes his attributes as a hunter, warrior and philosopher.|$|E

25|$|From outside, {{the temple}} {{actually}} looks like a ekakuta (single tower and shrine) temple because the two lateral shrines are simple extensions of {{the wall of the}} mantapa. Their towers are a later addition. This {{is a classic example of}} a trikuta (three shrines and towers) <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> ekakuta. A large open hall with tall pillars was added during later times making the original porch and closed mantapa look like the inner portion of the temple. The central shrine has five projections per side and the tower is complete though without the kalasha (decorative structure on top). Since the shrine is square in plan, the topping roof (a helmet like sculptured stone) follows the same plan. There are three tiers of decorative smaller roofs bearing their own kalasa that form the body of the main tower. The superstructure on top of the vestibule (forming the nose) has only two tiers of decorative roofs. This is why the sukanasi looks like an extension of the main tower. The two lateral shrines also have five projections per side. The top of these shrines and the wall of the mantapa are crowned with a row of decorated roofs just like the main shrine.|$|E
25|$|Kyo is {{the heir}} to the Tengu Clan. It is {{revealed}} that Kyo is not human but a powerful demon. When he is in his demon form, his hair grown longer, has black wings, and wears a mask <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> crow's beak. Perverted and cocky to many, but he treats Misao with a combination of kindness and coldness depending on his mood. Kyo met Misao during their childhood; they quickly developed a strong bond and {{he fell in love with}} her. They also made a promise that she would be his bride, which he is determined to fulfill. His older brother, Sho, was supposed to be clan leader, but Kyo surpassed him for Misao's sake (as only a clan leader may seek her as their bride). In order to stay close to Misao, he moved back to his house next door to hers and took a job as a math teacher at her school. He is always protecting her and healing her wounds, also finding moments to steal a kiss. While he cares deeply for Misao, Kyo has deep attachments to those close to him: such that he took Taro under his wings to train him and make him stronger after Taro was abused by Shou. Kyo has deep disdain towards his brother (for his abusive ways) and his father (whom he suspected of murdering his mother). After Sho's death, Kyo learns that Misao is pregnant with his child, a powerful demon child. He is initially happy of the news, but when he learns that the children of the Immortal Fruit will feed on their mothers after childbirth, he wants her to abort the pregnancy but she refuses. When Misao tells him that she loves the baby and it loves her, he comes to care for the baby. Misao gives birth to a boy, whom they name Sou. Misao, by miracle, survives and Kyo is able to live happily with her and Sou.|$|E
