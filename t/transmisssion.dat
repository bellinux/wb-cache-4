A properly designed fiber optic coupler will probably show no significant changes in optical <b>transmisssion</b> due to normal variations in the fiber configuration. It may be more difficult to eliminate configuration-dependent effects on the pupil of the transmitted beam, and thus achieve photometric stability to guiding and seeing errors.

That there are infinitely many such lines results in the wave propagating without ever reflecting at some discontinuity This work examines the case where the line is terminated after finitely many one-way infinite transmission lines with the result that reflected waves are now produced at both the far end {{as well as at the}} initial end of the <b>transmisssion</b> line. The questions of whether the reflected waves are infinitesimal or appreciable and whether they sum to an infinitesimal or appreciable amount are resolved for both distortionless and lossless lines. Finally, the generalization to higher ranks of transfiniteness is briefly summarized Key Words: transfinite transmission lines, hyperreal waves, nonstandard transients, nonstandard analysis of transmission lines. ...|$|E

This study confirms the initial reports of a high capacity for SVOF of 148 mAh/g above 3 V and that the reduction of silver above 3 V (vs Li+/Li 0) leads to a loss of SVOF crystallinity until it becomes completely amorphous between the third and fourth lithiums inserted. Next, vanadium is reduced between 2. 5 and 1. 5 V (vs Li+/Li 0) for the fifth and sixth lithiums inserted. In addition, the polarization within the cathode is significantly lower for the vanadium reduction than for the silver reduction.

To study the Indian plate kinematics, an IGS station has been established in September 1995 at NGRI, Hyderabad, India, under the Indo-German collaborative research programme. During the first off-line data <b>transmisssion</b> phase, about one to two days per week of observations were taken. The data analysis has been carried out at the University of Bonn using the Bernese Software version 4.0. The Hyderabad data have been processed together with the data from 8 other selected IGS stations in and around the Indian plate. In our preliminary analysis, which concentrated on the ITRF 96 frame-consistent part of the data set, we found the motion of the Indian plate with respect to the Eurasian plate to be significantly smaller than the model rate, i.e. 3.7 cm/y for Hyderabad instead of 4.5 cm/y in the NUVEL- 1 A plate model. We detected no significant motion between Hyderabad and Bangalore, lying 500 km apart in N-S-direction on the Indian plate.|$|E

Serotonin transporter 5 -HTT {{plays an important role}} in serotogenic <b>transmisssion</b> and the serotonin transporter gene is under investigation in connection with multiple psychiatric disorders. Three polymorphisms, an insertion/deletion and SNP in the promoter region and a variable nucleotide tandem repeat (VNTR) in intron 2, influence expression of the 5 -HTT gene. We examined these polymorphisms at the serotonin transporter protein locus (SLC 6 A 4) in three specific and representative cohorts drawn from the Czech population. These cohorts were stratified according to their age: a) randomly selected elderly individuals (over 75 years of age), b) young adults (age ranging between 19 - 45 years) and c) newborns, all with balanced gender representation. The two regions were amplified and resolved on a 2 % agarose gel and/or analyzed using the capillary electrophoresis in order to discriminate lenght polymorphisms. SNP in intron 2 was examined by RFLP after using MspI restriction. This analysis revealed that elderly individuals were statistically more likely than controls to carry two copies of the L allele of the lenth polymorphism.

40|$|Electron Beam Induced Deposition (EBID) allows {{deposition}} of three-dimensional micro- and nano-structures of conductive and insulating materials {{on a wide}} range of substrates. The process is based on the decomposition of molecules of a pre-selected precursor by a focused electron beam. In recent decades EBID of several metals, namely Au, W, Cu and Pt, from different families of precursors, has been achieved and the technique has found some application for small-scale production of laboratory devices and for repair of masks and micro-optoelectronic devices. The weak point of the technique is at present the low purity of the deposited material, caused by metal-organic precursors and by the lack of selectivity of the electron-induced decomposition process. This work is dedicated to EBID of Rh nanostructures from the precursor [RhCl(PF 3) 2] 2. High metal content deposits are expected because the precursor does not contain C atoms and because Rh is one of the less reactive metals. [RhCl(PF 3) 2] 2 as EBID precursor has been characterized by vapor pressure, mass spectrometry and surface residence time measurements. The vapor pressure of 7. 5 Pa at room temperature reveals that the precursor is sufficiently volatile for room temperature EBID. The knowledge of the vapor pressure allows also to estimate the number of precursor molecules delivered to the reaction area per unit time. Mass spectrometry measurements allow to know the decomposition path of the precursor under electron impact in the gas phase. The measured spectrum indicates that the molecule decomposes by successive loss of PF 3 groups, as confirmed by density functional theory calculations. This is compatible with a high metal content deposit. Residence time measurements show that [RhCl(PF 3) 2] 2 does not decompose on stainless steel surfaces. The measured residence time of 2 ms allows to estimate that the activation energy for desorption of [RhCl(PF 3) 2] 2 on stainless steel is about 0. 6 eV and that precursor molecules can travel distances in the micrometer range before being desorbed. EBID structures obtained from [RhCl(PF 3) 2] 2 have been characterized with a wide range of techniques for a better knowledge of the material properties and the deposition process. The deposit morphology has been studied by <b>Transmisssion</b> Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to characterize the different steps of the deposition process. Crystallographic analysis is carried out by TEM in diffraction mode. Chemical analysis is carried out by Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS). Morphological analysis of deposits carried out at different exposure times reveals that the first phase of the growth process, in close proximity to the substrate, is characterized by an increase of the deposit height and the deposit diameter. On the other hand the second phase of the growth process is characterized by increasing height and constant diameter. TEM contrast profiles of dots and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) sections of lines have clearly shown that the EBID rate is highest in the center of the beam and decreases in the peripheral regions. Deposition at variable distances from the precursor source allowed to obtain hollow structures, whose morphology reveals that the precursor reaches the reaction area mainly by direct gas phase transport. Structural analysis and TEM revealed that, independently of the deposition conditions, the deposited material is made up of Rh nanocrystals immersed in a lighter amorphous matrix. Chemical analysis by Auger Electron Spectroscopy revealed that, after removal of the C rich contamination layer by Ar ion sputtering, the average composition of the deposits is about: 60 at. % Rh, 20 at. % P, 5 at. % Cl, 7 at. % N, 8 at. % O. The absence of C and the presence of N and O in the deposit bulk have been confirmed by Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy. This technique allowed also to prove that Rh is dominant also in deposits of sub-micrometer size (not analyzable with AES) and to determine the elemental distribution in the deposit with nanometer resolution. Comparison of the deposit composition and the positive ions detected by mass spectrometry revealed that EBID, compared to low pressure gas phase ionization, involves a higher number of events, i. e. multi-electron decomposition and rearrangements of partially decomposed species...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{the result}} of my research work at the SMACS research group (Department of Telecommunications and Information Processing, Ghent University) and it concerns the analysis of queueing models with batch service. A queueing model basically is a mathematical abstraction of a situation where customers arrive and queue up until they receive some kind of service. These phenomena are omnipresent in real life: people waiting at a counter of a post office or bank, people in the waiting room of a doctor, airplanes waiting to take off, people waiting until they get connected with the call center, data packets which are temporarily stored into a buffer until the <b>transmisssion</b> channel is available, et cetera. The analysis of queueing models constitutes the subject of the applied mathematical discipline called queueing theory and amounts to answering questions such as “How many customers are waiting on average?”, “How long do customers have to wait?”, “Is there a large variation on the waiting time?”, “What is the probability that data packets are lost due to a full buffer?”, “What is the probability that a customer suffers a lengthy delay?”, et cetera. In queueing theory, the number of customers and their waiting time are often denominated by respectively buffer content and customer delay. In addition, the probability that a quantity, such as the buffer content or customer delay, is very large or lengthy, is generally called a tail probability. The models we investigate throughout this dissertation have in common that customers can be served in batches, meaning that several customers can be served simultaneously. An elevator {{can be viewed as a}} classic example, as several people can be transported simultaneously to another floor. Also, in a variety of production or transport processes several goods can be processed together. Furthermore, in quality control, classification of items as good or bad can often be achieved more economically by examining the items in groups rather than individually. If the result of a group test is good, all items within it can then be classified as good, whereas one or more items are bad in the opposite case, where the items can then be retested by considering smaller groups. Group testing is especially of importance when the percentage of bad items is small. In addition, in telecommunications networks, packets with the same destination and quality of service (QoS) requirements are often aggregated into so-called bursts and these bursts are transmitted over the network. This is mainly done for efficiency reasons, since only one header per aggregated burst has to be constructed, instead of one header per single information unit, thus leading to an increased throughput. Technologies using packet aggregation include for instance Optical burst switched (OBS) networks and IEEE 802. 11 n wireless local area networks (WLANs). An inherent aspect of batch service is that newly arriving customers cannot join the ongoing service, even if there is free capacity (we denominate the maximum number of customers that can be served simultaneously by server capacity). For instance, an arriving person cannot enter an elevator that has just left, even if space is available. This person has to wait until the elevator has transported its occupants to their requested floors and has returned, which might take a long time in high buildings. In view of this, it is of importance to take a well-considered decision when the server becomes available and finds less customers than it can serve in theory. This decision is called the service policy. A whole spectrum of service policies exist. The server could, for instance, start serving the already present customers immediately. Although the present customers benefit from this approach, capacity is wasted: customers that arrive later cannot join the ongoing service. An alternative for this so-called immediate-batch service policy is the full-batch service policy. In this case, the available server postpones service until the number of present customers reaches or exceeds the server capacity, which, in turn, has a negative effect on the delay of the customers waiting to form a full batch (postponing delay). The threshold-based policy is a kind of compromise between immediate-batch service policy and full-batch service policy. When the number of present customers is below some service threshold, service is postponed, whereas service is initiated when the number of present customers reaches or exceeds this threshold. It is important to realize that even with this compromise, long postponing delays are possible. Therefore, in this dissertation, we combine a thresholdbased policy with a timer mechanism that avoids excessive postponing delays. The purpose of this dissertation is to calculate a large spectrum of performance measures, which enable to evaluate a broad set of situations with batch service and aid in selecting an efficient service policy. The studied performance measures are moments, such as the mean value and variance, and tail probabilities of the buffer content and the customer delay. This dissertation is structured as follows. In chapter 1, we motivate our work and we introduce crucial concepts such as probability generating functions (PGFs), whose useful properties are frequently relied upon throughout the analysis. Then we deduce moments and tail probabilities of the buffer content in chapter 2. The resulting formulas still contain unknown probabilities that have to be calculated numerically. As this might become unfeasible in some cases, we compute in chapter 3 approximations for the buffer content. Next, moments and tail probabilities of the customer delay are covered in respectively chapters 4 and 5. In order to analyze the moments, we conceive the customer delay as the sum of two non-overlapping parts, whereas for the tail probabilities, it turns out to be more convenient to interpret the delay as the maximum of two time periods. Further, in real life the customer arrival process often exhibits some kind of dependency. For instance, if a large amount of customers have recently arrived, it is likely that many customers arrive in the near future, as it might be an indication of a peak moment. Therefore, we investigate in chapter 6 the influence of dependency in the arrival process on the behaviour of batch-service phenomena and on the selection of an efficient service policy. Finally, the main contributions are summarized in chapter 7...|$|E
