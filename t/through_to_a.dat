5|$|Chapman rejoined Arsenal in October2010, {{with the}} club on {{domestic}} hiatus before {{the launch of the}} FA WSL. She was praised by manager Laura Harvey after scoring late, decisive goals against Rayo Vallecano Femenino and Linköpings FC which helped to take Arsenal <b>through</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> UEFA Women's Champions League semi-final against eventual winners Lyon. In May2011, following injuries to Faye White and Jayne Ludlow, Chapman captained the Arsenal team which beat Bristol Academy 2–0 at the Ricoh Arena to reclaim the FA Women's Cup.|$|E
5|$|Angband (1990) was {{developed}} by Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand while attending the University of Warwick. Having played UMoria, they wanted to expand the game even further. Working from UMorias code, they {{increased the number of}} levels and monsters, flavored the game based on Angband, the massive fortress controlled by Morgoth from Tolkien's fiction, and incorporated more of the deadlier creatures described within the Middle Earth mythology. They kept the Balrog as a difficult creature that must be overcome at a mid-game level, while Morgoth became the final boss the player must defeat to win the game. Following Cutler and Astrand's graduation, Sean March and Geoff Hill took over the development to see the game <b>through</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> public release outside of the university, adding in elements such as giving the player a sense of the rewards and dangers of a level when they entered it the first time.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-finals, England were outplayed by Spain but got <b>through</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> penalty shootout after a goalless draw. Shearer {{scored the}} first England penalty, while the Spaniards failed to score {{from two of}} theirs, sending England into the semi-final against Germany. Shearer headed England into the lead after three minutes, but the Germans quickly {{equalised}} and the match went to penalties again. This time, Germany won from the spot; although Shearer scored, his teammate Gareth Southgate missed his kick and England were eliminated. Shearer's fivegoals made him the competition's top scorer, and together with teammates David Seaman and Steve McManaman, was listed in the official UEFA team of the tournament.|$|E

5|$|Kinkaid's {{first major}} {{decision}} was to bypass Kiska {{in favor of}} an assault on the less heavily defended Attu Island. He moved his headquarters to Adak to be with those of Buckner and Butler, and at Buckner's suggestion established a joint mess where their two staffs ate meals together. However, the amphibious planning was done in San Diego by Rockwell and his U.S. Marine Corps advisor, Brigadier General Holland M. Smith. The Battle of Attu was only the third American amphibious operation of the war, and was carried <b>through</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> costly success under difficult conditions. The slow rate of progress ashore caused Kinkaid to relieve the Army commander, Major General Albert E. Brown and replace him with Major General Eugene M. Landrum. In June 1943 Kinkaid was promoted to vice admiral, thereby removing any lingering doubts about who was in charge, and awarded his third Distinguished Service Medal. He now prepared Operation Cottage, the much larger invasion of Kiska. This was carried out as planned, but the invaders found that the Japanese had already evacuated the islands. In September 1943, Kinkaid was replaced by Vice Admiral Frank Fletcher.|$|E
5|$|The {{accommodation}} {{and other}} facilities are {{on the south side}} of the castle. On the ground floor, the entrance to the castle leads <b>through</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> courtyard, linked to four barrel-vaulted rooms in the south-west corner, originally 17th-century lodgings for the garrison. Two of these chambers were converted for use as magazines and the fittings of one of these still remains in place. In the south-east corner is the Master Gunner's House, comprising a parlour, hall and kitchen on the ground floor, and a chamber and attic on the floors above. The parlour and hall would have originally been separated by a screen; the chamber would also have been subdivided. On the first floor is a small chamber, supported on arches above the courtyard, which was used as a lodging. On the second floor, the Long Room runs on top of the barrel-vaulted chambers, its massive, original roof still intact.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 World Championship {{began with}} O'Sullivan {{defeating}} Dave Harold 10–4, {{followed by a}} struggle <b>through</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 13–10 win in his second-round match against Welshman Ryan Day. A similar quarter-final match ensued against Mark Williams. O'Sullivan led 10–6 going into the final session. A fightback by Williams saw him take the lead by winning the next five frames; but O'Sullivan held his nerve to take the match 13–11, and faced Graeme Dott in the semi–finals. Dott took an early lead before O'Sullivan drew level at 8–8 {{at the end of}} the second session. Cue-tip problems, which had dogged O'Sullivan throughout the event, recurred, including an incident in which television footage appeared to show O'Sullivan deliberately removing the tip of his cue. This secured him a 15-minute break to re-tip the cue, before he returned and made a 124 break. Tournament Director Mike Ganley accepted the player's assurance that the tip had simply fallen off, and no censure was made. The incident drew criticism from his opponent, and from Steve Davis and John Parrott. Dott then took all eight frames of the third session, leaving himself one frame away from his second final in three years. The final session saw O'Sullivan stage a minor fightback, taking three frames in a row, before a mistake let Dott back in for an eventual clearance on the black. After Dott's win, O'Sullivan gave his cue and case to a boy in the crowd. A BBC report claimed he had used as many as 21 different tips during the fortnight; O'Sullivan later stated that he had used seven tips before arriving in Sheffield, and a further eight during the week, and that he would return next season with a new cue. O'Sullivan's decision not to enter the Malta Cup cost him the number-one rank for the following season.|$|E
