5|$|The Treaty of Trianon {{was signed}} in 1920, {{at the end of}} World War I, between the Allies of World War I and Hungary (as one of the {{successor}} states of Austria-Hungary). The treaty regulated the status of the independent Hungarian state and defined its borders. Compared to the prewar Kingdom of Hungary (as a part of Austria-Hungary), post-Trianon Hungary lost 72 percent of its territory. The principal beneficiaries of the <b>territorial</b> <b>division</b> of the prewar Kingdom of Hungary were Romania, Czechoslovakia and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The treaty established the southern border of Hungary along the Drava and Mura rivers (except in Baranya, where only {{the northern part of the}} county was retained by Hungary). On 4 December 1918 the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (comprising present-day Croatia) joined the Kingdom of Serbia to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes.|$|E

Members of the 52nd at the time included the future Brigadier, Alastair Pearson.|$|E
25|$|The Nazi-Soviet treaty {{process was}} {{continued}} with the German–Soviet Frontier Treaty signed on 28 September. It adjusted and finalized the <b>territorial</b> <b>division,</b> placing Lithuania within the Soviet sphere and moving the Soviet-German agreed boundary east from the Vistula to the Bug River, and authorized further joint action to control occupied Poland. An idea of retaining a residual Polish state, considered earlier, was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The {{constituent}} {{states of}} the Republic lost their freedom, autonomy, independence, and sovereignty by being totally subordinated to the central government.

25|$|The current provincial {{division}} {{structure is}} based—with minor changes—on the 1833 <b>territorial</b> <b>division</b> by Javier de Burgos, and in all, the Spanish territory {{is divided into}} 50 provinces. The communities of Asturias, Cantabria, La Rioja, the Balearic Islands, Madrid, Murcia and Navarre are the only communities that are integrated by a single province, which is coextensive with the community itself. In these cases, the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community.|$|E

The two other Territorial infantry divisions; the 52nd at Rafa and the 54th (East Anglian) Division ordered out to Romani from the Suez Canal, were put directly under General Dobell commander of Eastern Force.

25|$|While many {{examples}} exist, {{the classic example}} was reported by Goody and Watt (1968). Written records prepared by the British in Ghana in the early 1900s show that Ndewura Jakpa, the seventeenth century founder {{of the state of}} Gonja, had seven sons, each of whom ruled a <b>territorial</b> <b>division</b> within the state. Six decades later two of the divisions had disappeared for various reasons. The myths of the Gonja had been revised to recount that Jakpa had five sons, and that five divisions were created. Since they had no practical, present purpose, the other two sons and divisions had evaporated.|$|E
25|$|During the war, Britain {{had been}} a major sponsor of Arab {{nationalist}} thought and ideology, primarily as a weapon to use against {{the power of the}} Ottoman Empire. Although the Arab forces were promised a state that included much of the Arabian Peninsula and the Fertile Crescent the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement between Britain and France provided for the <b>territorial</b> <b>division</b> of much of that region between the two imperial powers. During the inter-war years and the British Mandate period, when Arab lands were under French and British control, Arab nationalism became an important anti-imperial opposition movement against European rule.|$|E
25|$|The new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, {{approved}} after {{a referendum}} in 2006, was contested by important {{sectors of the}} Spanish society, especially by the conservative Popular Party, which sent the law to the Constitutional Court of Spain. In 2010, the Court declared non valid some of the articles that established an autonomous Catalan system of Justice, better aspects of the financing, a new <b>territorial</b> <b>division,</b> the status of Catalan language or the symbolical declaration of Catalonia as a nation. This decision was severely contested by large sectors of Catalan society, which increased the demands of independence.|$|E
