5|$|The {{third season}} of Parks and Recreation {{originally}} aired in the United States on the NBC television network between January 20 and May 19, 2011. Like the previous seasons, it focused on Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) {{and her staff}} at <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> <b>and</b> recreation department of the fictional Indiana town of Pawnee. The season featured 16 episodes, {{most of which were}} approximately 22 minutes long each and aired at 9:30p.m. on Thursdays.|$|E
5|$|Parks and Recreation is an American {{situation}} comedy created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur. The show premiered on NBC on April 9, 2009 and concluded on February 24, 2015 after airing seven seasons. The series stars Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope, an ambitious, mid-level bureaucrat working in <b>the</b> <b>Parks</b> <b>and</b> Recreation Department of Pawnee, a fictional town in Indiana. The sitcom features an ensemble cast, including Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza, Chris Pratt, Adam Scott, Rob Lowe, Paul Schneider, Jim O'Heir and Retta, among others.|$|E
5000|$|The Summit {{is located}} at the {{southern}} end of <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> <b>and</b> is <b>the</b> highest point in <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> It provides sitting locations on its gentle slopes as well as views over <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lake.|$|R
50|$|The Kettering Family Education Center anchors <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> {{features}} changing exhibits in the National City Exhibit Gallery, a video about <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> <b>and</b> {{gift and}} snack shops. There are also rooms for education presentations.|$|R
50|$|This list {{summarizes}} the major expeditions to the Yellowstone region {{that led to}} the creation of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> contributed to <b>the</b> protection of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> its resources between 1869 and 1890.|$|R
5|$|The {{comedy series}} focuses on Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), the deputy {{director}} of <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> <b>and</b> recreation department of the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana. The season consisted of six 22-minute episodes, all of which aired at 8:30p.m. on Thursdays. Daniels and Schur conceived the show when NBC officials asked Daniels to produce a spin-off of his comedy series The Office, on which Schur was a writer. During development, the creators decided the new show would be a stand-alone series, though it would share the mockumentary style of The Office. Like that show, Parks and Recreation encouraged improvisation among its cast members.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of Mayfair moved upper class Londoners away from {{areas such as}} Covent Garden and Soho, which were already in decline by the 18th century. Part of its success was because of its proximity to the Court of St James and <b>the</b> <b>parks,</b> <b>and</b> because of the well-designed layout. This led to it sustaining its popularity into the 21st century. The requirements of the aristocracy led to various stables, coach houses and servants' accommodation being established along the mews running parallel to the streets. Some of the stables have since been converted into garages and offices.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} of Parks and Recreation {{originally}} aired in the United States on the NBC television network starting September 17, 2009, and ended on May 20, 2010. The season {{was produced by}} Deedle-Dee Productions and Universal Media Studios, and series co-creators Greg Daniels and Michael Schur served as executive producers. Like the first season, it focused on Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) and her staff on <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> <b>and</b> recreation department of the fictional Indiana town of Pawnee. The episodes were approximately 22 minutes long each, all of which aired at 8:30p.m. on Thursdays.|$|E
5000|$|Weka Park is {{a public}} park in Raumati Beach on New Zealand's Kapiti Coast. It is the home ground of the local soccer team, Kapiti Coast United. [...] Cricket is also played at <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> <b>and</b> it has a children's playground. The Wharemauku Stream flows along the {{boundary}} of <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> <b>and</b> a walking track leaves <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> follows <b>the</b> stream to Rimu Road, a length of approximately 3 km.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> Hudson <b>Park</b> <b>and</b> Boulevard {{project was}} also {{included}} {{with the construction of}} the station, since <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> station were built concurrently with both station entrances located inside <b>the</b> <b>park.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{principal}} cast of six actors received star billing in the show's first season. Poehler {{portrayed the}} lead character, Leslie Knope, the naive but well-meaning, eager-to-please {{deputy director of}} <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> <b>and</b> recreation department of the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana. Also among the cast were Aziz Ansari as Tom Haverford, a sarcastic parks department employee, and Rashida Jones as Ann Perkins, a nurse who befriends Leslie and tries to help her turn a giant construction pit into a park. Daniels and Schur intended to cast Ansari and Jones (who previously appeared in The Office as Karen Filippelli) from the series' earliest stages of development, but the ultimate Parks and Recreation concept did not coalesce until they learned Poehler {{would be available to}} star. After her recruitment, the general concept of the series was established and the script for the pilot episode was written.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, Leslie (Amy Poehler) proudly announces to <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> <b>and</b> recreation staff that she will be judging the Miss Pawnee beauty pageant, a job she takes very seriously. Tom (Aziz Ansari), excited at the prospective of judging women {{on the basis of their}} looks, pulls some strings to get a spot on the judging panel along with Leslie. April (Aubrey Plaza) enters the contest in order to win the $600 prize, despite being disgusted with the concept of a beauty contest. She tries, unsuccessfully, to gain an advantage by sucking up to Leslie. Later, Pawnee police officer Dave Sanderson (Louis C.K.) visits Leslie at work to ask her out on a date. She initially accepts, but when Dave mistakes a photo of Madeleine Albright for Leslie's grandmother, Leslie becomes reluctant.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, the West Park Commission was riddled with {{political}} graft, and the three parks became dilapidated. As part of a reform effort in 1905, Jens Jensen was appointed as General Superintendent and Chief Landscape Architect for the entire West Park System. Jensen, now recognized as dean of the prairie style of landscape architecture, improved deteriorating sections of <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> <b>and</b> added new features. Among Jensen's improvements were a semi-circular entryway at Marshall Boulevard, and a formal garden at the corner of Ogden Avenue and Sacramento Drive. By the time Jensen designed the garden, Ogden Avenue, a diagonal roadway with a major streetcar thoroughfare that would later become part of Route 66, had already been constructed. The road divided the park into two separate landscapes, creating a busy intersection at the junction of Ogden and Sacramento Avenues. Jensen's solution was a long axial garden on the southeast side of the intersection, providing a buffer between Ogden Avenue and playing fields to the south. Jensen demolished the conservatories in each of the West Park System parks in favor of one grand conservatory at Garfield Park.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> {{preserve}} offer {{a variety}} of possible activities, including kayaking, rafting, hiking and camping. Most of the large Alaskan animals are present <b>and</b> viewable in <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> Fishing is allowed in both <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> preserve, while sport hunting is permitted in the preserve.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>park</b> is undeveloped <b>and</b> has no {{facilities}} {{available for}} visitors. No camping is allowed in <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> no walking tracks exist within <b>the</b> <b>park.</b>|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>park</b> {{presents}} different environments {{as regards}} flora, the principal being {{the forests of}} conifers ( [...] making up 9.9% of <b>the</b> <b>park),</b> <b>the</b> mixed forests ( [...] making up 14.5% of <b>the</b> <b>park),</b> of open bogs ( [...] making up 16.3% of <b>the</b> <b>park)</b> <b>and</b> woods ( [...] making up 5% of <b>the</b> <b>park)</b> <b>and</b> finally wetlands ( [...] making up 7.4% of <b>the</b> <b>park).</b>|$|R
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) holds {{a drawing}} to {{determine}} who will fill the park's hummingbird feeders, a job reviled by <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> <b>and</b> recreation department. Jerry (Jim O'Heir), who is often mocked by his co-workers, is chosen because everybody writes down Jerry's name instead of their own. Later, Leslie receives a call from Ann (Rashida Jones) that Jerry is {{in the hospital with}} a dislocated shoulder. Jerry claims to have been mugged in the park, and Leslie decides nobody should tease Jerry anymore. When Jerry returns, he acts particularly buffoonish during a slideshow presentation, and ends up farting and splitting his pants, but everyone holds back laughter at Leslie's request. Leslie meets with Carl Lorthner (Andy Samberg), a park security ranger who is incredibly loud but oblivious to the fact. Leslie suggests Carl get more help for the park to be safe. Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) teaches a self-defense course {{to the rest of the}} department so they don't end up like Jerry.|$|E
5|$|Next to Columbia River, long {{segments}} of the 40 Mile Loop skirt the north edge of the slough watershed, while other segments such as the north–south I-205 Bike Path cross it or, {{as in the case}} of the largely unfinished Columbia Slough Trail, run through it generally along an east–west axis. The 40Mile Loop is a partly completed greenway trail around and through Portland and other parts of Multnomah County. Originally proposed by the Olmsted Brothers, architects involved in the planning for Portland's Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition of 1905, it has expanded to a projected , encircling the city and connecting parks along the Columbia, Sandy, and Willamette rivers and Johnson Creek. <b>The</b> <b>parks</b> <b>and</b> other public spaces in the watershed have their own pedestrian paths, some of which are also bicycle paths that connect to the 40Mile Loop. Many gaps lie between completed trail segments.|$|E
5|$|Parks and Recreation faced early {{production}} delays because Poehler {{was pregnant}} when she signed on; filming {{had to be}} postponed until she gave birth. Principal photography began on February 18, 2009. The show was filmed in Southern California, and the construction pit featured throughout the season was dug by the episode's producers at an undeveloped property in Van Nuys, a district of Los Angeles. The producers went door-to-door in the neighborhood, seeking residents' permission for the dig. The pit was guarded 24hours a day, and paparazzi regularly came to the set to take photos of the actors during filming. The exterior of the Pawnee government building, {{and several of the}} hallway scenes, were shot at Pasadena City Hall. <b>The</b> <b>parks</b> <b>and</b> recreation department interiors, as well as the Town Hall courtyard, were filmed on a sound stage. The set's windows were outfitted with water systems to simulate falling rain, and the windowsills included fake pigeons. Scenes set in playgrounds and elsewhere outdoors were filmed on location in Los Angeles, and the public forum scenes in the premiere episode were filmed in one of the city's middle schools.|$|E
50|$|SR 355 {{began at}} an unsignalized {{intersection}} with SR 122, {{also known as}} West Main Street, in the western extents of Eaton. SR 355 headed south on the two-lane Camden Road first past <b>the</b> <b>park</b> exit <b>and</b> then between <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mound Hill Cemetery. The route turned right into <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> wound its way throughout <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> past <b>the</b> museum <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> areas. <b>The</b> route ended at <b>the</b> <b>park</b> exit at Camden Road, just 170 ft south of where the route started at SR 122.|$|R

50|$|Pontypool's main {{leisure centre}} is located within <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> was {{refurbished}} from 2003 to 2006. In 1975, a dry ski slope {{was constructed in}} <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> remains in use. <b>The</b> <b>park</b> also has outside tennis courts, bowling green and netball courts. Pontypool RFC also has its home here <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> has an 8,800-capacity stadium.|$|R
5|$|Poehler became {{pregnant}} {{during the latter}} half of the season, with her baby due in the summer or early fall of 2010. <b>The</b> <b>Parks</b> <b>and</b> Recreation producers decided not to write the pregnancy into the show, so they decided to enter into a continuous production after the season ended to bank episodes for the third season. Six season three episodes were filmed in this fashion. However, in May 2010, NBC announced the third season of Parks and Recreation was being moved to an undisclosed midseason premiere date to allow the network's new comedy, Outsourced, to run in the Thursday two-hour comedy schedule block. NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no effect on the show's momentum, but could actually build anticipation for its eventual return. In November 2010, it was announced Parks and Recreation would return to a 9:30p.m. Thursday timeslot effective January 20, 2011.|$|E
5|$|The deleted scenes {{included}} on the DVD were originally featured on the official Parks and Recreation website after the episode aired. In the first, a minute-long clip, Ron tries {{to take a job}} offer that was previously offered to him at an Internet flower company web site, but when he finds the business is doing so poorly, he sadly realizes he will be in his government job for a long time. In a second minute-long clip, Leslie talks about her very detailed life plan, which involves eventually becoming head of the parks department, then governor of Indiana, then U.S. vice president and then getting married at age 84. The deleted clips were featured on <b>the</b> <b>Parks</b> <b>and</b> Recreation official website within a week of the episode's original production date.|$|E
5|$|With {{effect from}} 1 September 2008, under the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) Order 2008 ("2008 PEMA Order"), {{responsibility}} for registering people wishing to speak or stage an exhibition or performance at Speakers' Corner {{was taken over}} from the police by the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation by way of an amendment to <b>the</b> <b>Parks</b> <b>and</b> Trees Regulations. To provide greater convenience, the National Parks Board {{made it possible for}} people to register online at its website. In addition, it became possible to hold demonstrations provided that they are organized by Singapore citizens and the participants are only citizens and permanent residents. As the time period restriction was lifted, events can now be held around the clock. In addition, rules on voice amplification were revised to allow the use of self-powered amplification devices like loudhailers from 9:00a.m. to 10:30p.m. This relaxation of the rules potentially allows for speakers' messages to be heard by larger audiences. A minor change was also introduced to the conditions for the use of Speakers' Corner – no banner, film, photograph, placard or poster containing any violent, lewd or obscene material may be displayed or exhibited whether before, during or after the event.|$|E
