5|$|Heavy rains fell {{during the}} night of September 5/6 and mud slowed all wheeled and <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the withdrawal. The 2nd Battalion {{disengaged}} from the North Korean and began its withdrawal at 03:00 on September 6. The North Koreans quickly discovered that the 2nd Battalion was withdrawing and attacked it. In the vicinity of Hills 464 and 380 the battalion discovered at daybreak that it was virtually surrounded by North Koreans. Moving by itself and completely cut off from all other units, G Company, numbering only about 80 men, was hardest hit.|$|E

The hydro-mechanical {{differential}} turning {{mechanism is}} the new type of double power flow turning mechanism of <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The hydraulic stepless speed regulation and the high efficiency of mechanical transmission are integrated into the turning mechanism. The stepless turning of <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> can be achieved. Basing on hydro-mechanical differential turning theory, the scheme design of steering wheel control system of <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> of hydro-mechanical differential turning is finished. By establishing model of steering wheel control system, its working stability and following characteristic is simulated and analyzed in this paper.

40|$|Different {{types of}} off road {{vehicles}} {{are widely used}} in agriculture, oil industry, mining and military operations {{but none of them}} can effectively operate over the swamp peat terrain because of its low bearing capacity of 7 kN/m 2. Segmented rub-ber <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> and intelligent air-cushion system <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> were developed in Malaysia for swamp peat terrain. 16 kN/m 2 of ground pressure was exerted by using the segmented rubber <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> during field operation therefore could not be operated efficiently. The air-cushion <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> increased the floatation capacity {{but at the same time}} in-creased the frictional effects therefore the <b>tracks</b> of the <b>vehicle</b> easily slipped out from the traction wheels during operation. Addressing these issues an intelligent additional track mechanism for <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> has been designed to improve the mobility over swamp peat terrain where the additional track would be increased the ground surface area and reduced the vehicle ground pressure. This paper presents the process involved in designing the intelligent additional <b>track</b> mechanism <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> for transportation of agricultural and industrial goods on the swamp peat terrain with bearing capacity of 7 kN/m 2. The mechanical design comprises of <b>track</b> <b>vehicle</b> frame with <b>track</b> mechanism. Additional track mechanism with Fuzzy expert system. The design parameters are optimized using developed mathematical model based on the dynamics and kinematics behavior of the vehicle. In order to increase the vehicle contact surface area and reduce the surface contact pressure the additional track mechanism is designed in such way that it can be folded and unfolded from its position by us...|$|R
5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the stop lines and the {{anti-tank}} islands that followed was to hold up the enemy, slowing progress and restricting the route of an attack. The need to prevent tanks from breaking through was of key importance. Consequently, the defences generally ran along pre-existing barriers to tanks such as rivers and canals; railway embankments and cuttings; thick woods; and other natural obstacles. Where possible, usually well-drained land was allowed to flood, making the ground too soft to support even <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wheels {{are prone}} to slipping—an {{inability}} to generate traction—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead {{to a loss of}} control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels {{can be seen in the}} realm of human technology: in an example of biologically inspired engineering, legged vehicles find use in the logging industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate. <b>Tracked</b> <b>vehicles</b> suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground—but they tend to have larger turning radii than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.|$|E
5|$|The force {{deployed}} {{with a large}} {{quantity of}} construction and other equipment, including 24 Land Rovers, 19 Unimog all-terrain vehicles, 26 heavy trucks, 43 trailers, eight bulldozers {{and a variety of}} other road-building equipment such as graders, scrapers and rollers. The support workshop added a further 40 vehicles, and over 1,800 tonnes of stores were shipped with the contingent's equipment. There was a total of over 200 wheeled and <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicles</b> and trailers and a large quantity of dangerous cargo (demolition explosives and ammunition). The UN hired the MV Mistra for the deployment. It departed Sydney on 23 March; the equipment was unloaded at Walvis Bay in mid-April, moving by road and rail to the South African Defence Force Logistics Base at Grootfontein.|$|E

5|$|The {{mission of}} the ARVN central column was to advance down {{the valley of the}} Se Pone River, a {{relatively}} flat area of brush interspersed with patches of jungle and dominated by heights to its north and the river and more mountains to the south. Almost immediately, supporting helicopters began to take fire from the heights, which allowed PAVN gunners to fire down on the aircraft from pre-registered machine gun and mortar positions. Making matters worse for the advance, Route 9 was in poor condition, so poor in fact that only <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicles</b> and jeeps could make the westward journey. This threw the burden of reinforcement and resupply onto the aviation assets. The helicopter units then became the essential mode of logistical support, a role that was made increasingly more dangerous due to low cloud cover and incessant anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
5|$|Croatian President Franjo Tuđman {{called on}} the public to bring the siege to an end, and the plea {{resulted}} in a large-scale protest against the JNA in Split, organised by the Croatian Trade Union Association in the Brodosplit Shipyard on 6 May 1991. On 7 May, 80 tanks and <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicles</b> and 23 wheeled vehicles of the JNA 10th Motorised Brigade left barracks in Mostar, only to be stopped by civilians ahead of Široki Brijeg, west of Mostar. The convoy remained in place for three days as the crowd demanded that the JNA lift the siege of Kijevo. The protest ended after Alija Izetbegović, the President of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, visited and addressed the protesters, assuring the crowd that the convoy was heading to Kupres rather than Kijevo. Tuđman and Cardinal Franjo Kuharić sent telegrams to the protesters supporting Izetbegović. The siege of Kijevo was lifted through negotiations a few days later, {{two weeks after the}} blockade had been imposed.|$|E
5|$|Along the coast, the 2/28th Infantry Battalion was {{assigned}} {{the task of}} leading the Australian advance along with a troop from the 1st Tank Battalion and engineers from the 2/7th Field Company. Commencing in the afternoon of 27 November, they began clearing operations between Bonga and North Hill along the coast with a secondary task of sending a company towards Pabu to facilitate the relief of the 2/32nd. In the vicinity, the Japanese 20th Division, consisting of {{the remnants of the}} 79th, 80th and 238th Infantry Regiments, numbered 4,670 men, of which 2,500 were combat effective. The lead company of the 2/28th Infantry Battalion moved off shortly after midday, passing through the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion's lines. Initially there was no opposition and by the afternoon they established a defensive position near a waterfall. The following morning, the advance continued. The ground astride the coastal track, although flat, was covered in dense jungle, which was not suitable for <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicles</b> to move across. The result of this was that the Australian tanks had to remain on the track, advancing behind the infantry, which limited the rate of their advance and prevented them from being able to apply the full weight of their firepower.|$|E

5|$|In February, as the ice {{bridge and}} snow road were {{carrying}} <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicles</b> north, Alyeska awarded {{a contract to}} design the construction and maintenance road. Michael Baker, Jr., Inc., a firm in Pennsylvania, was awarded the contract. To cross the Yukon River, the state of Alaska designed a bridge and paid two-thirds of its cost. The remaining third was paid by Alyeska, and the bridge was built by Manson-Osberg-Ghemm. On April 5, the contracts to build the road were picked. In total, the new Dalton Highway cost $185 million to build, and four companies shared that cost. Construction of the Dalton Highway started on April 29, and {{at the peak of}} the effort, Alyeska and the four subcontractors had more than 3,400 workers deployed from the Yukon River to Prudhoe Bay. A massive airlift was created to supply the road construction effort; more than 700 flights per day—170,000 in total—were required before the road was finished on September 29. In just 154 days, a 360-mile gravel road had been built. Final grading had to be done and more than 20 small permanent bridges had to be built, but by November, the road was open to traffic crossing the Yukon River on another ice bridge.|$|E

40|$|Four updated video {{guidance}} sensor (VGS) {{systems have}} been proposed. As described in a previous NASA Tech Briefs article, a VGS system is an optoelectronic system that provides guidance for automated docking of two vehicles. The VGS provides relative position and attitude (6 -DOF) information between the VGS and its target. In the original intended application, the two vehicles would be spacecraft, but {{the basic principles of}} design and operation of the system are applicable to aircraft, robots, objects maneuvered by cranes, or other objects that may be required to be aligned and brought together automatically or under remote control. In the first two of the four VGS systems as now proposed, the <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> would include active targets that would light up on command from the <b>tracking</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and a video camera on the <b>tracking</b> <b>vehicle</b> would be synchronized with, and would acquire images of, the active targets. The video camera would also acquire background images during the periods between target illuminations. The images would be digitized and the background images would be subtracted from the illuminated-target images. Then the position and orientation of the <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> relative to the <b>tracking</b> <b>vehicle</b> would be computed from the known geometric relationships among the positions of the targets in the image, the positions of the targets relative {{to each other and to}} the rest of the <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and the position and orientation of the video camera relative to the rest of the <b>tracking</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The major difference between the first two proposed systems and prior active-target VGS systems lies in the techniques for synchronizing the flashing of the active targets with the digitization and processing of image data. In the prior active-target VGS systems, synchronization was effected, variously, by use of either a wire connection or the Global Positioning System (GPS). In three of the proposed VGS systems, the synchronizing signal would be generated on, and transmitted from, the <b>tracking</b> <b>vehicle.</b> In the first proposed VGS system, the <b>tracking</b> <b>vehicle</b> would transmit a pulse of light. Upon reception of the pulse, circuitry on the <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> would activate the target lights. During the pulse, the target image acquired by the camera would be digitized. When the pulse was turned off, the target lights would be turned off and the background video image would be digitized. The second proposed system would function similarly to the first proposed system, except that the transmitted synchronizing signal would be a radio pulse instead of a light pulse. In this system, the signal receptor would be a rectifying antenna. If the signal contained sufficient power, the output of the rectifying antenna could be used to activate the target lights, making it unnecessary to include a battery or other power supply for the targets on the <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{considers}} the steering {{characteristics of a}} four-row <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> crawling on extremely cohesive soft soil, where each side is composed of two parallel tracks. The four-row <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> (FRTV) {{is assumed to be}} a rigid body with 6 -DOF. A dynamic analysis program for the <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> is developed using the Newmark- method based on an incremental-iterative scheme. A terra-mechanics model of an extremely cohesive soft soil is implemented {{in the form of the}} relationships of the normal pressure to the sinkage, the shear resistance to the shear displacement, and the dynamic sinkage to the shear displacement. In order to investigate the steering characteristics of the four-row <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle,</b> a series of dynamic simulations is conducted with respect to the distance between the left and right tracks (pitch), steering ratios, driving velocity, reference track velocity, lengths of the tracks, and properties of the cohesive soft soil.

In the present work, the <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle,</b> containing 17 dof with 14 suspension stations along with an additional driver's seat bounce degree of freedom, has been developed in simMechanics. The simMechanics model incorporates the equivalent vertical nonlinear suspension characteristics of <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> suspension system, in each of the road-wheel stations. The sprung mass consists of the bounce, pitch and roll degrees of freedom and each of the unsprung masses consist of bounce degree of freedom. An additional degree of freedom is also formulated in the model, by virtue of driver seat motion. The <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> responses have been captured over defined terrains. The simMechanics model has been validated with an equivalent non-linear ride mathematical model of the full <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The developed simMechanics model may be used for vehicle dynamic control related studies and also may easily be co-simulated with multi-physical domains...|$|R
