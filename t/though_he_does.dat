5|$|Further martyrdoms {{followed}} in the months thereafter, increasing in the next spring, when the new governor, Urbanus, published the fourth edict. Eusebius probably does not list a complete account of all those executed under the fourth edicthe alludes in passing to others imprisoned with Thecla of Gaza, for example, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not name them.|$|E
5|$|Cheenu {{returns the}} next day and, after paying a huge sum to the madam, takes Vijaya out, {{supposedly}} on a pleasure trip. He takes her away to Ketti, where he is working as a school teacher. He takes her to his residence, where he protects her and also pampers her like a child. Viji, as she is called by Cheenu, has completely forgotten her past and becomes very close to him. When Viji accidentally spills ink over Cheenu's documents, angering him, their relationship is threatened, but they reconcile. Later, a local woodcutter named Nataraj lusts for Viji and nearly assaults her, but she manages to save herself. When she tells Cheenu about it, he becomes livid with rage and almost kills Nataraj, but is stopped by his neighbours who were informed of the incident by Viji. Meanwhile, the wife of Cheenu's headmaster is attracted to Cheenu, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not reciprocate her feelings.|$|E

5|$|When Monk {{returns with}} Natalie (Traylor Howard) to Dr. Kroger's office, they meet Francis Merrigan (Gordon Clapp), who owns an {{importing}} and exporting business {{based in the}} same building. Merrigan is carrying a milk carton, which {{he says he is}} utilizing for a coffeemaker. That night, someone throws a rock through the window of Dr. Kroger's house. Stottlemeyer and Disher keep the suspicion on one of Dr. Kroger's patients. As they interview the Kroger family, they learn Kroger suspects his rebellious son Troy (Cody McMains) did it. Monk, however, believes that whoever killed Teresa might have thrown the rock to make everyone believe that one of Dr. Kroger's patients is involved. Monk recognizes the rock, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not know where he saw it.|$|E
5|$|During an interview, Satoh said Rurouni Kenshin {{was one of}} {{the first}} manga he read to the point he would play sword-fights with his friends. Additionally, once he was cast as Kenshin, Satoh started intense swordsmanship training. Satoh said he liked Kenshin's {{character}} to the point of enjoying role in the three films. However, the actor expressed pressure in doing the role as a result of having to take part in multiple fighting scenes. Nevertheless, Satoh said he enjoyed Kenshin's lines due to the impact they have on most characters, most notably his enemies. Due to the Kyoto films showing a darker characterization of Kenshin as he struggles against different strong rivals, Satoh also said his work became more challenging. Still, he found it interesting. A scene that Satoh enjoyed was Kenshin's fight against Sawagejō Chō due to the fact Kenshin is forced to attack his enemy even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not know his weapon is deadly which goes against his morals; as a result, Satoh briefly showed Kenshin's hitokiri side for a brief moment. The actor said he discussed this scene with the director who pleased with the result. Kenshin's strongest technique, the Amakakeru Ryū no Hirameki, was Satoh's favorite move as he likes its meaning. While Kenshin shouts his attacks' names in both manga and anime, Satoh instead decided to say the names after performing those moves.|$|E

25|$|Joaquin Phoenix as the Abbé du Coulmier, the well-loved {{administrator}} at Charenton asylum.

Before settling on Joaquin Phoenix, casting directors considered Jude Law, Guy Pearce, and Billy Crudup for the role.|$|E

25|$|Justice Butler {{believed}} {{that in this}} case, the Court was not called upon {{to decide whether the}} display of the flag constituted constitutionally-protected speech, nor to decide whether such speech was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, nor whether the real or imagined anarchy that could follow a successful opposition to organized government creates a sufficiently compelling reason to prohibit such activities. It appears (<b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not specify it in his dissent) that he viewed the matter as that of procedural challenges, rather than a case of broad protections of freedom of speech.|$|E
25|$|In Al-Jabr, al-Khwarizmi uses {{geometric}} proofs, he {{does not}} recognize the root x = 0, and he only deals with positive roots. He also recognizes that the discriminant must be positive and described the method of completing the square, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not justify the procedure. The Greek influence is shown by Al-Jabrs geometric foundations and by one problem taken from Heron. He makes use of lettered diagrams {{but all of the}} coefficients in all of his equations are specific numbers since he had no way of expressing with parameters what he could express geometrically; although generality of method is intended.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} {{episode of the}} first season, the year is firmly {{established}} by Data, as 2364. This {{marked the first time}} an explicit future calendar date had been attached to a Star Trek storyline, and allowed fans and writers to extrapolate further dates. For example, the established date implies McCoy was born around 2227, ruling out the Spaceflight Chronology-derived dating of the original series to the early 23rd century (though the dating had already been effectively overruled by Star Trek IV, which primarily takes place in 1986, where Kirk tells Gillian Taylor that he is from the late 23rd Century, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not give an exact date).|$|E

25|$|In his 1997 account, Chatterjee infers the {{presence}} of feathers from alleged quill knobs on the badly smashed ulna and metacarpals III and IV, and infers {{the presence}} of remiges from such structures (<b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> caution that this is uncertain). As {{is the case with}} the alleged quill knobs on the ulna, the metacarpal structures appear to be attributable to post-mortem damage. Moreover, the thumb, unlike the case in all birds, is not medially divergent. Considering how poorly preserved the ulna is, it is entirely premature to make any definitive conclusions as to {{the presence of}} quill knobs until such time as more adequate material becomes available. Upon further examination of the material no structures were isolated that could be deemed as homologous to remigial papillae.|$|E
25|$|Manuscripts also differ. Usually the {{differences}} are minor—matters of spelling and the like—but occasionally they are significant, {{as in the case}} of the Comma Johanneum, a clause in the First Epistle of John that bears explicit witness to the doctrine of the Christian Trinity, but is not found in any manuscript earlier than the 10th century (codex 221), where it is shown as a marginal note. A similar example from the Old Testament is the difference between the Septuagint and Masoretic descriptions of the battle of David and Goliath: the Septuagint version is shorter and avoids the narrative inconsistencies of the familiar Masoretic story, notably the famous incident of Saul asking who David is as <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not know his own harpist and shield-bearer.|$|E
25|$|The victorious British leaders meet, and the {{recently}} widowed Regan now declares she will marry Edmund. But Albany exposes the intrigues of Edmund and Goneril and proclaims Edmund a traitor. Regan falls ill, having been poisoned by Goneril, and is escorted offstage, where she dies. Edmund defies Albany, who {{calls for a}} trial by combat. Edgar appears masked and in armour, and challenges Edmund to a duel. No one knows who he is. Edgar wounds Edmund fatally, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not die immediately. Albany confronts Goneril with the letter which {{was intended to be}} his death warrant; she flees in shame and rage. Edgar reveals himself, and reports that Gloucester died offstage from the shock and joy of learning that Edgar is alive, after Edgar revealed himself to his father.|$|E
