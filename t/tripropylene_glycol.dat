In many systems, particulates and surfactants co-exist and can largely define {{the stability of the}} foam. A typical example is froth flotation where hydrophobic particles and frothers are essential to maintain a stable froth. Grinding operations may yield a product containing submicron-size particles, which can affect the flotation process. The present study compares the foaming and gas dispersion properties of the non-ionic surfactants 1 -pentanol, <b>tri(propylene</b> <b>glycol)</b> methyl ether, and poly(propylene glycol) 425 in the presence of hydrophobic colloidal silica particles in a column. In all cases, it has been found that the gas holdup increases proportionally with the increase in the concentration of particles in the system although an initial decrease may be observed. The effect of particles on the foaminess seems to be dependent upon the surfactant. With the 1 -pentanol, the addition of particles systematically decreased the foaminess of the solutions. This is in contrast to poly(propylene glycol) solutions, which exhibited an increase. Interestingly, low concentrations of particles appeared to improve the foaminess of <b>tri(propylene</b> <b>glycol)</b> methyl ether; however, the froth became less stable with further increases in the number of particles in the column.

40|$|Most {{processes}} involving bubbling in {{a liquid}} require small bubbles to maximise mass/energy transfer.

The increase in coalescence time with surfactant concentration could not be attributed only to surface elasticity.

The gas dispersion properties in a column were tested for solutions of 1 -pentanol, <b>tri(propylene</b> <b>glycol)</b> methyl ether, and poly(propylene glycol) in the presence of sodium chloride. The dependency of surfactant on the gas holdup can be divided into regions. It seemed that for a sufficiently low concentration of surfactant, even a stronger surfactant could show a transition in gas holdup from constant/decreasing to increasing with concentration. This region, however, was not marked by a decrease in the average bubble size. In addition, PPG gave higher gas holdup values while averaging larger bubbles. On the other hand, sodium chloride mostly affected the gas holdup when the concentration was high enough to prevent bubble coalescence. Another parameter affecting the gas holdup was the superficial gas velocity. A linear dependency was found between the two under a bubbly flow regime.

This polymer-network hydrogel coating consists of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAM), cross-linking agent <b>tripropylene</b> <b>glycol</b> diacrylate (TPGDA), and a new photochromic spiropyran monoacrylate. In a pre-study, a linear NIPAAM copolymer (without TPGDA) that contained the spiropyran dye was synthesised, which showed relatively fast photoswitching behaviour. Subsequently, the photopolymerisation of a similar monomer mixture that included TPGDA afforded freestanding hydrogel polymer networks. The light-induced isomerisation of protonated merocyanine into neutral spiropyran under slightly acidic conditions resulted in macroscopic changes in the hydrophilicity of the entire polymer film, that is, shrinkage of the hydrogel. The degree of shrinkage could be controlled by changing the chemical composition of the acrylate mixture. After these pre-studies, a hydrogel film with spatially modulated cross-link density was fabricated through polymerisation-induced diffusion, by using a patterned photomask.

The beta process was identified as the true Johari-Goldstein relaxation by using a criterion based on the coupling model prediction. The faster gamma relaxation, well separated from the primary process, undoubtedly exhibits the anomalous behavior near the glass transition temperature (T-g) which {{is reflected in the}} presence of a minimum of the temperature dependence of the gamma-relaxation time.

40|$|Broad-band {{dielectric}} spectroscopy is {{a commonly}} used {{tool in the}} study of glass-forming liquids. The high sensitivity of the technique together with the wide range of probed time scales makes it a powerful method for investigating the relaxation spectra of liquids. One particularly important class of glass-forming liquids that is often studied using this technique consists of liquids dominated by hydrogen (H) bond interactions. When investigating such liquids, particular caution has to be taken during sample preparation due to their often highly hygroscopic nature. Water can easily be absorbed from the atmosphere, and dielectric spectroscopy is a very sensitive probe of such contamination due to the large dipole moment of water.

From these fuels, it is well-known that they lead to lower particle (PM) emissions; however, for a given fuel oxygen mass fraction, there are significant differences in PM reduction. Although this {{can be traced back}} to the specific molecular structure of the oxygenate in question, no consensus can be found in the literature as to the explanation hereof. In this study, the sooting tendency (smoke number) of three oxygenates [viz., <b>tripropylene</b> <b>glycol</b> methyl ether (TP), dibutyl maleate (DB), and cyclohexanone (X 1) ] was compared to that of commercial diesel fuel (EN 590, D).

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Froth {{flotation}} is {{a widely}} used separation technique in the mineral processing industry. It consists of capturing valuable, hydrophobic particles with air bubbles, which rise to the surface. The bubbles segregate at the surface to form a froth zone. Valuable particles are recovered by the overflowing/skimming of the froth phase. The froth phase {{plays a crucial role}} in upgrading the concentrate by draining out non-valuable particles. The stability of the froth phase is partly controlled by chemical factors (e. g. surfactants) and physical factors (e. g. particles) among others. Inherent to the process, froth stabilising particles are depleted, which compromises the stability of the froth phase in subsequent flotation cells. This thesis details the stabilisation of flotation froth by the addition of hydrophobic silica nanoparticles and salt to improve flotation performances in the presence of non-ionic frothers. With this objective in mind, a system of nanoparticle, non-ionic surfactants, and inorganic electrolytes were characterised by their performance in a binary coalescence apparatus and a bubble column before being tested in flotation. The effect of the chemical reagents on the coalescence of bubbles was determined using the bubble-pair technique developed by Ata. The four non-ionic surfactants (i. e. 1 -pentanol, 4 -metyl- 2 -pentanol, <b>tri(propylene</b> <b>glycol)</b> methyl ether, and poly(propylene glycol) 425) were characterised using bubbles of 2 mm in diameter. Among the selected surfactants, the polyglycols were found to provide greater resistance to coalescence. It was also found that a minimum concentration is required to have any effect on the coalescence time. This is opposite to the results with alcohols, which showed a smoother transition from coalescing to non-coalescing. The oscillation of the projected area of the resultant bubble was quantified using the damping coefficient of the oscillation. It was noticed that an elasticity of approximately 1 mN m- 1 was needed to immobilise the surface. Too much surfactant could reduce the stability of the bubbles and the surface due to a fast relaxation of the surface. Some inorganic electrolytes are known to prevent bubble coalescence. Chloride and sulphate electrolytes were tested. There appeared to be two regions; a low and a high concentration region. At low concentrations, the resistance to coalescence was in the order of milliseconds whereas coalescence was prevented for seconds at higher concentrations. The two regions observed could be the result of a transition affected by the relative speed of approach of the capillary bubbles. Using sodium chloride as a typical inorganic electrolyte, the oscillation of the resultant bubble showed no significant variation with increasing concentration. The dynamic foaming and gas dispersion properties of 1 -pentanol, <b>tri(propylene</b> <b>glycol)</b> methyl ether, poly(propylene glycol), sodium chloride, and octanol-esterified nanoparticles were investigated by sparging N 2 gas in solutions contained in a bubble column of 40 mm in diameter. The gas holdup was found to initially slightly decrease upon addition of NaCl from 10 - 5 to 10 - 3 M, but increased at a concentration of 10 - 1 M. Accordingly, the bubble mean diameters (d 10 and d 32) decreased only at 10 - 1 M NaCl. A sufficient concentration of non-ionic surfactant increased the gas holdup. In the case of poly(propylene glycol), the lowest concentrations tested in the study slightly decreased the gas holdup, which then sharply increased. In general, an increase in gas holdup could be explained by the ability of the surfactant {{to reduce the size of}} the bubbles. A bi-modal bubble size distribution was observed under some experimental conditions. Interestingly, the results were somewhat related to those obtained from the coalescence of capillary bubble pairs. Bi-modal bubble size distributions were associated with a coalescing environment (i. e. short coalescence time) and low resistance to the expansion and compression motion of the surface upon coalescence (i. e. low damping constant). The 300 nm octanol-esterified silica nanoparticles increased the gas holdup. The effect of particles was mostly believed to be the outcome of changing the fluid properties such as the density and the viscosity. While mixed with surfactant, a small concentration of nanoparticles resulted in an increase in the gas holdup by preventing bubble coalescence. The foams were evaluated using the unit of foaminess defined by Bikerman. Although the hydrodynamic and surface excess concentrations were different, the surfactants followed a trend similar to that found for the coalescence of capillary bubble pairs. That is, the polyglycols were more persistent than the 1 -pentanol. It was shown that surface elasticity could mostly, although not solely, dictate the drainage and rupture of foam films of dilute concentration or surfactant solutions. On the other hand, elasticity could allow enough stability to the film for surface forces to be active at higher surfactant concentrations. The presence of sodium chloride was found to either increase or decrease the foaminess of surfactant solutions depending on the concentration of surfactant. This was attributed to the effect of surface forces. When used in conjunction to nanoparticles, sodium chloride improved the foaminess of the colloidal dispersions in the concentration range where the particles have tendency to coagulate. The effect of silica nanoparticles on the foaminess of surfactant solutions seemed to be dependent on the concentration of surfactant and particles. The nanoparticles somewhat improved the foaminess of polyglycol solutions. At 0. 01 wt% of particle, the foaminess of <b>tri(propylene</b> <b>glycol)</b> methyl ether solutions was enhanced. However, the foaminess decreased with further addition of particles. In the case of poly(propylene glycol), the foaminess increased with the concentration of particles over the concentration range tested. The nanoparticles were also observed to affect the structure of the foam by preventing coalescence within the foam. Lastly, flotation of coarse silica was performed in the presence of nanoparticles and salt. Poly(propylene glycol) was chosen as a frother due to the positive impact found in the bubble column with the addition of nanoparticles. The presence of additives improved the properties of the froth, which resulted in a higher overall recovery. This confirms the possibility of using nanoparticles to enhance froth stability and improve the performance of flotation cells...|$|E

The performance of the pentacene and the polymer dielectric materials within devices was investigated, demonstrating (1) the ability to deposit good quality pentacene layers in the roll-to-roll environment and (2) the importance of the e-beam curing conditions of the dielectric layer on the performance of the organic FET devices. This deposition route creates a smooth, pin-hole-free dielectric layer as it is deposited onto the substrate as a monomeric liquid, before curing, and there is no mass-loss such as in solvent-based deposition processes. These devices have a 250 μm channel length and an aspect ratio of 16. No self-assembled monolayer (SAM) or other surface modification had been applied to the insulator layer to achieve these properties. The tuning of the transistors' operating voltage and output characteristics was feasible through the ease of control of the polymer dielectric thickness achieving a threshold voltage of less than 10 V. On/off ratio in excess of 10 3, and mobility = 0. 1 cm 2 V - 1 S - 1 have been achieved. The ability to integrate such a high deposition rate polymer process, into a single step, multilayer, vacuum deposition process with conventional vacuum deposition sources provides a possible route to low cost and large area electronic device processing. © 2011 Materials Research Society...|$|E
40|$|Non-degradable waste tire {{generation}} {{around the}} world is growing at an alarming rate. Diversifying the recycling route of these waste tires is essential to solve the problem. One way is to incorporate them into polymers and convert them into new products. However, incorporation of ground tire rubber into thermoplastics has been hampered due to lack of toughness and adhesion between phases. To address the issue, this study utilized reclaimed waste tire rubber (RTR) instead; and evaluated the properties of RTR and poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) blends. The properties of the RTR/EVA blends were further enhanced by compatibilization and electron beam irradiation. Processing, mechanical, thermal and dynamic mechanical properties of RTR were tremendously improved by blending with EVA. However, the interfacial adhesion was found to lack in the blends. Compatibilization by reactive, physical and combination strategies were explored utilizing (3 -Aminopropyl) triethoxy silane (APS), liquid styrene butadiene rubber (LR) and maleated EVA (MAEVA), respectively. APS and MAEVA were found to be the most and least favourable compatibilizer, respectively. Apart from functioning as reactive compatibilizer, APS also reclaimed the RTR phase further. These lead to improved dispersion of smaller RTR phase in EVA matrix and enhanced the interfacial adhesion. Electron beam irradiation revealed the presence of radical stabilizing and scavenging additives within RTR which retards the crosslinking process in RTR and RTR/EVA blends. Though chain scissions were predominant; study showed the replacement of S-S and S-C bonds with stronger and stiffer C-C bonds ensures the retention of RTR and RTR/EVA blends properties upon irradiation. Compatibilization of RTR/EVA blend by APS (50 RTR/ 5 APS) also improved the crosslinking efficiency. However, the blend still suffered from oxidative degradation from irradiation in air. Radiation sensitizers, trimethylol propane triacrylate (TMPTA), <b>tripropylene</b> <b>glycol</b> diacrylate (TPGDA) and N,N- 1, 3 Phenylene Bismaleimide (HVA 2), were used to accelerate the irradiation induced crosslinking in RTR and 50 RTR/ 5 APS blends. Presence of radiation sensitizers leads to simultaneous improvement in toughness and tensile strength of RTR and 50 RTR/ 5 APS blends. Elastic capacity of RTR phase was restored and interfacial adhesion enhanced in the presence of radiation sensitizers...|$|E
40|$|UV {{radiation}} curing {{is a novel}} {{technology in}} the field of organic coatings. It involves curing of reactive resin using the energy of photons in the wavelength region 200 - 400 nm. The most attractive feature of this method is its low space, low capital and low energy consumption. Free radical polymerizable acrylate resins are the most commonly used resins in UV curing. The UV curable acrylates are mainly used as protective and decorative coatings. In general curing displays a complex interdependence of chemical kinetics and physical phenomenon like gelation and vitrification. This is well known for curing of epoxies and holds true for acrylates as well. As the resin polymerizes, there is an increase in its molecular weight and cross-link density. This causes slowing down of molecular relaxation and transport processes and an increase in viscosity, which is indicated by slowing down of the reaction kinetics. The chemical kinetics shifts from reaction-controlled to diffusion-controlled regime. This phenomenon can be described as a “Negative-Feedback” between molecular diffusion and chemical reaction. Therefore, {{in order to understand the}} curing mechanism, we need to understand the dependence of the mechanical properties and the underlying relaxation processes on chemical conversion. Thus, the main objective of this work is to study the conversion and mechanical shear modulus of acrylate coatings simultaneously and in real time by using the combined Ultrasound reflectometry (US) and NIR spectroscopy with a fast data acquisition rate in the range of milliseconds. The interdependence of the chemical kinetics and the dynamic shear modulus can be illustrated in terms of modulus-conversion curves. Different series of experiments were done by varying the concentration of nanoparticles, photoinitiator and reactive diluent, and UV-light irradiation time. In addition to the combined US/NIR experiments, a detail viscoelastic characterization (frequency and temperature dependent) of the uncured and cured resins is done using DMTA. Further, the modulus-conversion curves of the reactive diluent <b>tripropylene</b> <b>glycol</b> diacrylate (TPGDA) and a mixture of epoxy acrylate (EPA) and reactive diluent TPGDA are simulated with an empirical model and compared with the experimental data. The surface mechanical properties like scratch resistance, abrasion resistance and the optical properties like haze of the coatings are also studied and correlated with their chemical structure...|$|E
40|$|A {{process has}} been {{developed}} to make the dielectric layer for organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) in a roll-to-roll vacuum web coater environment. This dielectric layer combined with an organic semiconductor layer and metal layer deposited in vacuum allows a solvent-free process to make organic/inorganic multilayer structures for thin-film electronic devices on a flexible substrate at, potentially, high speed. The polymeric gate dielectric layers were fabricated by flash evaporation of acrylic monomers onto a polymer film with pre-patterned metal gates followed by radiation curing by electron beam, ultra-violent light (UV) or plasma. With a non-polar dielectric surface, charge carrier mobility (μ) of 1 cm 2 -V - 1 s - 1; on/off curren ratio of 10 8, sub-threshold swing (SS) of 0. 3 V/decade and saturated output curve were routinely achieved in dinaphtho-[2, 3 -b: 2 ' 3 '-f]thieno[3, 2 -b]thiophene (DNTT) transistors with dielectric layer of <b>tripropylene</b> <b>glycol</b> diacrylate (TPGDA) of ~ 400 nm. Apart from the TPGDA, monomer formulas including 1, 6 -Hexanediol diacrylate (HDDA) {{as well as several}} commercial acrylic resins have been used to make the dielectric layer. The highest areal capacitance of 41 nF-cm - 2 was achieved with a pin-hole free film of less than 100 nm made of an acrylate mixture resin. A non-polar dielectric surface treatment layer has been developed based on flash evaporation of lauryl acrylate and HDDA mixture. The transistors with the buffer layer showed constant performance and a mobility fivefold greater than those of untreated samples. The effect of humidity, oxygen, and light during switching cycles of both pentacene and DNTT transistors were studied. Water and oxygen/illumination had a distinct effect on both pentacene and DNTT transistors. Oxygen leads to acceptor-like charge traps under illumination, which shifted the turn-on voltage (V to) to more positive values. In contrast, water in transistors gave rise to donor-like charge traps, which shifted the V to and the threshold voltage (V T) more negatively. The DNTT devices showed good stability in dry air without encapsulation, while pentacene transistors degraded with either repeating measurement or long term storage. A DNTT transistor with a PS-coated TPGDA dielectric layer showed stable drain current (I d) of ~ 105 A under bias stress of the gate voltage (em>V g) of - 20 V and the drain voltage (em>V d) of - 20 V for at least 144 hours. The V to shift after the stress was less than 5 V and was recoverable when the device was kept in dry air for a few days. Possible reasons for the V to shift have been discussed.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} Near Infrared (NIR) initiated photopolymerization of multifunctional acrylic esters with NIR-LEDs emitting between 750 – 870 nm. These systems {{comprise a}} zwitterionic cyanine as sensitizer and an iodonium salt with distinct substitution pattern {{in both the}} cation and anion. An optically open window from the UV into the visible part allows embedding of functional materials covering particular this spectral range. Reactivity was studied with a synchronized photo-DSC comprising a self-designed hardware setup for data acquisition. 28 new iodonium salts ([A-I-B]+X-) were studied to show the influence of structural pattern on reactivity. [A-I-B]+X- possesses a different substitution pattern for the cation and the anion, respectively. Electron transfer of the excited state of the polymethine to the iodonium cation bearing different anions such as benzilate, lactate, NO 3 -, PF 6 -, SbF 6 -, p-CH 2 =CH-Ph-SO 3 -, p-C 12 H 15 -Ph-SO 3 -, CF 3 SO 3 -, C 4 F 9 SO 3 -, B(CN) 4 -, B(Ph) 4 -, B(PhF 5) 4 -, N(CN) 2 - or (SO 2 -CF 3) 2 N- results in initiating radicals. Although most of these anions {{do not participate in}} the redox mechanism, there exists a certain dependence between reactivity {{and the nature of the}} anion. Anions with low coordination behavior ((SO 2 -CF 3) 2 N-, B(Ph) 4 -,B(PhF 5) 4 -, B(CN) 4 -) result in acceptable reactivity. This may be explained by the conductivity of the salt in the acrylate monomers such as hexane- 1, 6 -diol diacrylate, <b>tripropylene</b> <b>glycol</b> diacrylate, poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate and trimethylolpropane triacrylate being different. A high ion mobility leads connects always to a high conductivity. Thus, complete dissociation is necessary to obtain a reactive system. The solubility of the different iodonium salts covers several g/L up to well mixable systems (> 2000 g/L). A good solubility is not mandatory to obtain a high reactivity but it is desirable from a practical point of view. Particular the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide anion (N(SO 2 -CF 3) 2 -) results in giant solubilities depending on the iodonium cation. Such photoinitiating systems are interesting because they bleach at the excitation wavelength and open therefore the opportunity to cure coatings with large thickness; that is a length up to several millimeters (14 mm). In addition, NIR-exposure additionally results in formation of light-stable brownish photoproducts. This represents an interesting alternative compared to brownish pigments used in dental materials. These findings require to understand the mechanism of sensitizer decomposition in more detail applying exposure kinetics and a coupling of Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) with mass spectrometry (MS) to analyze the photoproducts formed. Data show unexpected cleavage of the polymethine chain at typical positions in case of the oxidized species. These were formed as a result of electron transfer between the excited state of the photosensitizer and the iodonium salt. UPLC-MS experiments additionally indicated a certain sensitivity of the system upon adding of acids and radicals generated by thermal decomposition of AIBN. Thus, treatment of the photoinitiator composition (sensitizer and iodonium salt) with either radical or proton forming agents led almost to the same products no matter the system was either exposed with NIR light or not. Futhermore, photo-initiated crosslinking of multifunctional acrylic esters in polymeric binders was investigated based on digital imaging using the Computer-to-Plate (CtP) technology applying laser exposure in the NIR at 830 nm. Iodonium salts derived from several borates and those with the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide anion resulted in lithographic materials with high sensitivity being comparable with those used in industrial systems. Finally, iodonium salts comprising the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide anion exhibit a lower cytotoxicity compared to those with the tetraphenyl borate anion as determined by the MTT-test using CHO- 9 -cells...|$|E
