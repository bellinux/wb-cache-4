The balance of measurements, especially between the width and height of the cross, seem derived from the sides and diagonals of squares, and dynamic rectangles. Cimabue was not rigid in his placement, however, and to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> <b>of</b> Christ's body, altered the positioning {{of some of the}} boards on the lower half.|$|E
5|$|With no army left {{to defend}} Tigranocerta, and a foreign populace that gleefully opened the gates to the Romans, Lucullus' army began the {{wholesale}} looting and plunder of the city. The city was literally deconstructed piece by piece. The king's treasury, {{estimated to be}} worth 8,000 talents, was looted and each soldier in the army was awarded 800 drachma. The battle also resulted in severe territorial losses: most of the lands in Tigranes' empire {{to the south of}} the Taurus fell under <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> <b>of</b> Rome.|$|E
5|$|Mike Brown {{counters}} {{these claims}} by saying that, far from not having cleared their orbits, the major planets completely control {{the orbits of}} the other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist {{with a large number}} of small bodies in its orbit (the Trojan asteroids), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> <b>of</b> the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits. The orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant.|$|E

5|$|Governor Violante Beatrice and the Dowager Electress, {{following}} the former's sojourn in Rome, {{in spite of}} their mutual dislike of each other, attempted to ameliorate Gian Gastone's decadent public image together. Violante Beatrice organised banquets to remove him from <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> <b>of</b> the Ruspanti. His behaviour at these sent guests running for their carriages: he vomited into his napkin, wiped his mouth with his peri-wig and told rude jokes. These parties ceased when Violante Beatrice died, in 1731; Gian Gastone was devastated by the loss of his beloved sister-in-law. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died, as the public never saw him. To discredit these, the Dowager Electress induced Gian Gastone to make a public appearance—his final one—on Saint John the Baptist's day of 1729. An alcoholic, Gian Gastone drank too much before the ceremony and vomited repeatedly throughout; he had to be carried unconscious back to the Palazzo Pitti, the royal palace, on a litter. A sprained ankle incurred in July 1729 left the Grand Duke bed-ridden for—barring two occasions—the rest of his life.|$|E

25|$|The Peshwas had {{established}} their sovereignty over Gujarat including Saurashtra, and collected taxes and tributes through their representatives.

25|$|Following this period, {{the region}} of Mesopotamia seems to have come under <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> <b>of</b> a Sumerian conqueror from Adab, Lugal-Ane-mundu, ruling over Uruk, Ur, and Lagash.

However, his empire fell apart with his death; the king-list indicates that Mari in Upper Mesopotamia was the next city to hold the hegemony.|$|E

25|$|From the 17th {{century to}} the middle of the 18th century, between China proper and Transoxania, all the land was under <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> <b>of</b> the Dzungars. In Semirechye the Kyrgyz and Kazakahs were {{forcibly}} driven out by the Dzungars and the Kashgar Khanate was conquered. However, the Dzungar Empire was annihilated by Qing China from 1755-1758 in a formidable assault, ending the Central Asian states danger from the Dzungar menace.|$|E
25|$|This {{fact and}} the extent of his conquest are known from his inscriptions. Towards the end of his reign, or before his death, the Rashtrakutas under Krishna III invaded the Tamil Country, killed the Chola prince Rajaditya at Takkolam (near Arakkonam) in c. AD 948, and seized Tondainadu which they ruled for {{about a quarter of a}} century, {{confining}} <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> <b>of</b> the Cholas to their ancestral dominion comprising the modern day Thanjavur and Tiruchirapalli districts.|$|E
25|$|In the 3rd century AD, the Goths {{arrived in}} the lands of Ukraine around 250–375AD, which they called Oium, {{corresponding}} to the archaeological Chernyakhov culture. The Ostrogoths stayed in the area but came under <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> <b>of</b> the Huns from the 370s. North of the Ostrogothic kingdom was the Kiev culture, flourishing from the 2nd–5th centuries, when it was overrun by the Huns. After they helped defeat the Huns {{at the battle of}} Nedao in 454, the Ostrogoths were allowed by Romans to settle in Pannonia.|$|E
