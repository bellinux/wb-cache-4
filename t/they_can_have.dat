5|$|In the {{beginning}} of a match, a 30-second headstart is given to the Monster so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> enough time to escape before the Hunters parachute from a plane to where the Monster started. Each map features an open world environment for players to explore and play within. To help the Hunters navigate the environments quickly, they are equipped with jetpacks, allowing them to jump over obstacles and cliffs. The jetpack {{can also be used to}} dodge attacks performed by the monster, though it consumes a Hunter's energy. The team can track the monster, as well as place waypoints on an interactive map. The color of these waypoints are different based on what players have marked. The waypoint mark turns yellow for environment, orange for wildlife or red for the Monster.|$|E

5|$|Optimus awakens to {{find that}} three weeks have passed, {{and in that time}} Cybertron has been reformatted into a {{primordial}} state, Megatron is missing while the Decepticons that formed the Deceptigod have been fitted with explosive microchips to keep them under control, and many unaligned Cybertronians (referred to as NAILs and led by former Autobot Metalhawk) have returned and are demanding the exile of both the Autobots and Decepticons so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> the planet for themselves. With the Matrix now emptied of all its power, Optimus decides to go by his old name of Orion Pax, and agrees to leave Cybertron forever in exchange for the Autobots being allowed to stay.|$|E
5|$|Poppy interferes in Dot's {{relationship}} with her son, Nick (John Altman), telling him that his mother {{does not want to}} speak to him. She then allows Fatboy to stay with her after Tamwar throws him out. Poppy is then devastated to learn that Fatboy shared a passionate kiss with Denise Fox (Diane Parish), after hearing the pair whispering about it. She then learns that Fatboy and Denise had slept together before he was even in a {{relationship with}} Poppy. This infuriates Poppy, who storms over to the Minute Mart and confronts Denise, leading to the two women clashing in the shop. Poppy then returns home and tells Fatboy that she has forgiven him, but she needs to move away from Walford so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a fresh start. Fatboy refuses to move and says he wants to end their relationship. She packs her bags and leaves Walford for Hemel Hempstead, but not before posting a letter through Ian's letterbox, detailing about his fiancée's infidelity.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} now under a rector, who {{replaced}} the lay abbot; and any remaining priests of the clas and their abod were presumably expelled. If one accepts {{the evidence of}} the inquisition taken before Rhys ap Gruffydd, lieutenant of the Justiciar, at Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn, 1 September 1326 (which conflicts with Gerald's account), as early as 1212 there were apparently only two monks (from St Peter's, Gloucester) in residence. However, {{it is difficult to see}} how <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> remained, in light of Welsh control of the area; possibly they had only arrived in 1211; we don't know whether there was a priest resident (one of the monks might have been a priest).|$|E

5|$|The film brings {{together}} the video diaries recorded by four friends and {{students at the}} Tariq bin Ziad High School for Boys in Zayouna, a mixed-race, middle-class area in the Karrada suburb of Baghdad, Iraq. Entering their final year in 2006, each has high expectations for the year ahead and hope to graduate so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a chance to attend university. At the same time, the boys must also deal with the increasing sectarian violence that is starting to extend into Karrada. They face the threats of roadside bombings, the hassles of security checkpoints {{on their way to}} school, frequent curfews, the constant presence of American Apache helicopters overhead, and the deterioration of their neighbourhood which becomes rife with assassinations, muggings and kidnappings. Many of their fellow students, unmotivated and academically underperforming, are absent from school.|$|E
5|$|The flesh in {{the gills}} is {{composed}} of cylindrical hyphae measuring between 4 and 8μm thick that run parallel to one another. The hyphae typically have fairly thin, smooth walls, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> {{a small amount of}} brown pigment, which stains orange-brown in potassium hydroxide. The pileipellis, the uppermost layer of hyphae in the cap, forms a cutis made up of cylindrical, slightly thicker-walled hyphae of between 5 and 10μm wide. They can be interwoven or primarily extending from the margin to the centre. The pigmentation is yellowish-brown and stains reddish-brown in potassium hydroxide. The hyphae below the pileipellis run parallel to one another and measure between 4 and 8μm in width. Their yellowish-brown pigment stains orange-brown in potassium hydroxide. The stipitipellis, the uppermost layer of hyphae on the stem, also forms a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae run parallel to one another and have thick cell walls. They have a dark red-brown pigment, which stains darker still in potassium hydroxide. Clamp connections are present.|$|E
5|$|Labradors have a {{reputation}} as a very even-tempered breed and an excellent family dog. This includes a good reputation with children of all ages and other animals. Some lines, particularly those that have continued to be bred specifically for their skills at working in the field (rather than for their appearance), are particularly fast and athletic. Their fun-loving boisterousness and lack of fear may require training and firm handling at times to ensure it does not get out of hand—an uncontrolled adult can be quite problematic. Females may be slightly more independent than males. Labradors mature at around three years of age; before this time <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a significant degree of puppy-like energy, often mislabelled as being hyperactive. Because of their enthusiasm, leash-training early on is suggested to prevent pulling when full-grown. Labradors often enjoy retrieving a ball endlessly (often obsessively) and other forms of activity (such as agility, frisbee, or flyball).Although they will sometimes bark at noise, especially noise from an unseen source ("alarm barking"), Labradors are usually not noisy or territorial. They are often very easygoing and trusting with strangers and therefore are not usually suitable as guard dogs.|$|E

5|$|The film {{presents}} {{examples of}} crowd psychology and collective behavior {{which can lead}} to mass hysteria and the loss of social order. The bafflement, outrage, and helplessness associated with the lack of information, combined with new media such as blogs, allow conspiracy theorists like Krumwiede to spread disinformation and fear, which become dangerous contagions themselves. Dr. Cheever must balance the need for full disclosure but avoid a panic and allow the time to characterize and respond to an unknown virus. The movie indirectly critiques the greed, selfishness, and hypocrisy of isolated acts in contemporary culture and the unintended consequences <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> {{in the context of a}} pandemic. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends social distancing by forcibly isolating the healthy to limit the spread of the disease, which stands in stark opposition to contemporary demands for social networking. Responding to the pandemic presents a paradox, as the contagiousness and lethality of the virus instills deep distrust of others but surviving and limiting the spread of the disease also requires individuals to work together.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} several modes: Star Trip, Simple, Deluge, and Time Attack. Star Trip is Meteos story mode. Its plot {{centers on the}} evil planet Meteo sending its matter (the meteos) to other planets, killing life and {{destroying}} worlds. After three meteos fuse and launch themselves and other meteos into space, the civilizations on other planets plan a counterattack against Meteo. The player travels from planet to planet on the Metamo Ark, a warship made of metean ore. The story has branching paths, with the last level requiring the player to defeat Meteo itself. The Simple mode allowed a quick {{play of the game}} while letting the player change the rules, such as the difficulty and the number of lives <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>have.</b> The Deluge mode meanwhile lasts until the player dies. Time War has two goals: getting the high score in a limited time or launching as many meteos as possible from a set number. The game also has a multiplayer mode, where the player can send up to four other players a demo to play against each other with one game cartridge.|$|E
5|$|To do this, Rincewind is told to {{discover}} who they are, and recover a golden item from each, since these items {{are what they}} use to control the dragon. Learning that a book about summoning dragons had been stolen from the library at Unseen University the night before, Rincewind gains access to L-Space, allowing him to journey into the past, witness the theft, and follow the thief back to the brotherhood's hideout. After gaining entry in disguise, Rincewind learns that each member holds {{a role in the}} city — Chucky the Fool, the Thief, the Mason, the Chimney Sweep, the Fishmonger, and the Dunny King — and seeks to change the city so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a better future for themselves. Acquiring their golden items, Rincewind brings them to the dragon, only to learn it will not return to its dimension but seek revenge on the brotherhood before coming after him. Wishing to stop this, Rincewind decides to prevent the summoning book from being stolen, by switching it for one that makes love custard. In his efforts to be recognised for stopping the dragon, Rincewind gets into an argument with the Patrician over the existence of dragons, summoning the very same one back to Discworld. An annoyed Patrician tasks Rincewind to deal with it.|$|E
