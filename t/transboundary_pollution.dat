40|$|This Article asks why {{regulation}} of <b>transboundary</b> <b>pollution</b> remains so underdeveloped {{in a world}} where environmental policy in general is becoming increasingly centralized. In Part I, I canvass in greater detail the disparity between official norms and legal reality in the {{regulation of}} <b>transboundary</b> <b>pollution.</b> In Part II, I ask whether certain structural features common to <b>transboundary</b> <b>pollution</b> disputes account for this failure. In Part III, I consider the additional possibility that the failure of <b>transboundary</b> <b>pollution</b> regulation is partly a function of the official legal norm of strict liability that supposedly governs these disputes. In Part IV, I return to the original jurisdiction decisions rendered by the United States Supreme Court in the first three decades of this century. In Part V, I will advance some reasons why such a golden rule, operating in tandem with another golden rule that would require source states to treat affected states as well as the source state treats its own citizens, provides a more satisfactory starting point for overcoming the structural barriers to the effective regulation of <b>transboundary</b> <b>pollution.</b> I do not claim that the golden rules offer a panacea for <b>transboundary</b> <b>pollution.</b> The very real structural obstacles to effective regulation discussed in Part II will continue to frustrate most proposals for collective action. Furthermore, there are circumstances in which the golden rules would not improve upon strict liability-for example, where the polluting activity is novel and has not given rise to any tradition of regulation in either state. My contention is more modest and comparative: the golden rules, with their appeal to a general standard of reciprocity, provide a better foundation for building a consensus for meaningful regulation of <b>transboundary</b> <b>pollution</b> than does the current assumption in favor of a universal norm of strict liability...|$|E

40|$|<b>Transboundary</b> <b>pollution</b> is a {{particularly}} serious problem as it leads people located at regional borders to disproportionately suffer from pollution. In China, where the environmental policy is decentralized and where environmental conflicts between provinces have occurred several times, <b>transboundary</b> <b>pollution</b> is likely to exist. However, until now, nearly all the studies focused on developed countries. In this paper, we study whether <b>transboundary</b> <b>pollution</b> problems exist in China. To do so, we estimate whether, within Hebei province, polluting firms {{are more likely to}} set up in border counties than in interior ones. To ensure the robustness of our results, several measures of the variable of interest are constructed from Geographic Information System (GIS) data. The estimations of a count-data model allow us to conclude that border counties are more attractive destinations for polluting firms than counties located within the province. Moreover, it appears that this effect has strengthened over time. <b>Transboundary</b> <b>pollution,</b> firm location choice, environmental regulations, China...|$|E

40|$|A {{standard}} {{result in}} the literature on environmental economics is that efficient environmental policies regulating <b>transboundary</b> <b>pollution</b> will be adopted only if there is interjurisdictional coordination. Efficient policies can be adopted as a result of interregional treaties or mandated by a central authority. The present paper demonstrates that if there is perfect population mobility between the regions affected by the <b>transboundary</b> <b>pollution,</b> the efficient outcome is a Nash equilibrium of the policy game between regional authorities. This is true independently of what policies are available to the regional authorities.
