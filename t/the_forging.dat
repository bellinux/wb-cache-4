5|$|The Middle Ages brought {{advances}} in forge welding, in which blacksmiths pounded heated metal repeatedly until bonding occurred. In 1540, Vannoccio Biringuccio published De la pirotechnia, which includes descriptions of <b>the</b> <b>forging</b> operation.

5|$|Born {{near the}} eastern edge of the Cape Colony, Kruger took part in the Great Trek as a child during the late 1830s. He had almost no {{education}} apart from the Bible and, through his interpretations of scripture, believed the Earth was flat. A protégé of the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius, he witnessed the signing of the Sand River Convention with Britain in 1852 and over the next decade played a prominent role in <b>the</b> <b>forging</b> of the South African Republic, leading its commandos and resolving disputes between the rival Boer leaders and factions. In 1863 he was elected Commandant-General, a post he held for a decade before he resigned soon after the election of President Thomas François Burgers.|$|E
5|$|In St-Calais' time as bishop, {{a long-running}} dispute began between the monks {{of the cathedral}} chapter and {{successive}} bishops. This arose because St-Calais {{did not make a}} formal division of the diocesan revenues between the bishop's household and the monks of the chapter. Nor had he allowed free elections of the prior. He may have promised these things to the monks before his death, but nothing was in writing. Thus, when a non-monk was selected to replace St-Calais, the monks began a long struggle to secure what they felt had been promised to them, including <b>the</b> <b>forging</b> of charters ascribed to St-Calais that supported their case. These forged charters date from {{the second half of the}} 12th century.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the most}} evident {{trace of the}} iron {{industry}} {{in the region is}} <b>the</b> <b>forge</b> of Gysinge. This forge was established in 1668 initially for the production of arms. <b>The</b> <b>forge's</b> location permitted a good access to metal, extracted at the mine of Dannemora, to wood and to the energy of the Gysinge rapids. <b>The</b> <b>forge</b> grew rapidly and in the 18th century there were constructed around <b>the</b> <b>forge</b> homes, mills, stables, a manor and even a hotel. In the 18th century, <b>the</b> <b>forge</b> was {{one of the largest in}} the country, with 50 people working at the mill proper, and 3000 people connected to <b>the</b> <b>forge</b> in other ways. <b>The</b> <b>forge</b> was also <b>the</b> first in the world to use an oven for induction, the oven Kjellin. <b>The</b> <b>forge</b> closed at <b>the</b> beginning of the 20th century.|$|R

5|$|While The Loves of the Plants {{celebrates the}} natural world and {{advances}} several scientific hypotheses regarding {{the formation of the}} cosmos, the moon and the earth, The Economy of Vegetation celebrates scientific progress and technological innovation, such as <b>the</b> <b>forging</b> of steel, the invention of the steam engine and the improvements to gunpowder. It depicts scientists and inventors, such as Benjamin Franklin, responsible for this progress as the heroes of a new age; he “mythologizes” them. The poem at some points goes further, into what would now be called science fiction, forecasting that the British Empire will have giant steam-powered airships ("The flying-chariot through the fields of air. Fair crews triumphant, leaning from above") and far-ranging submarines ("Britain's sons shall guide | Huge sea-balloons beneath the tossing tide; The diving castles, roof'd with spheric glass, Ribb'd with strong oak, and barr'd with bolts of brass, Buoy'd with pure air shall endless tracks pursue").|$|E

5|$|As Voyager {{installs}} the Isodesium, a ship is {{sent from}} <b>the</b> <b>Forge</b> to tear Voyager apart for resources. Tuvok leads the Hazard Team {{to a nearby}} derelict dreadnought gunship to use the gunship's weaponry to destroy the incoming ship, but is only successful in disabling it as it attaches to Voyager. Voyager is consequently swarmed by crab-like aliens intent on carrying off crew and cargo, although the crew manages to eliminate these aliens. Munro prompts the captain to counterattack, in order to destroy the dampening field projected by the station. The Hazard Team uses <b>the</b> <b>Forge's</b> ship to infiltrate <b>the</b> <b>Forge</b> and disable its defensive systems, allowing the Voyager crew to attack using shuttlecraft; however, Crewman Biessman is killed while waiting for Voyagers reinforcements. <b>The</b> <b>Forge's</b> power core is destroyed, thereby dropping the dampening field. Munro, however, learns of the species behind <b>the</b> <b>Forge,</b> <b>the</b> Vohrsoth, and the station's true purpose: to harvest the genetic features of those trapped by <b>the</b> <b>Forge</b> to create an army designed for conquering the galaxy. Munro disobeys orders to ensure the Vohrsoth cannot recreate <b>the</b> <b>Forge</b> and kills <b>the</b> Vohrsoth commander. With power restored, Voyager attacks <b>the</b> <b>Forge</b> and destroys <b>the</b> station, beaming Munro off {{in the last few}} moments. Voyager and other active ships in the area are freed, and Munro is promoted to lieutenant.|$|R

50|$|TQ 533 353 Birchden Forge {{had a large}} pond, fed by two streams. It was {{mentioned}} in the will of Roger Machyn, proved in 1524. In 1574 it was sold to Sir Walter Waller, passing to Michael Weston in 1579. In 1595 the Earl of Dorset bought <b>the</b> <b>forge,</b> his tenant being Thomas Richardson. It was recorded on a map of 1598. <b>The</b> <b>forge</b> was sold to John Baker in 1617, with tenant Richard Maynard, who left his half share in Birchden and Hamsell furnaces to his son-in-law in 1619. <b>The</b> <b>forge</b> was operating in 1653 and 1667.

2500|$|Woodcock Forge is {{believed}} to have been built by Jack Dancy of Turners Hill. Hedgecourt Mill is thought to have been remodelled by him about the same time. The pond at Hedgecourt acted as a storage for <b>the</b> Woodcock <b>forge.</b> <b>The</b> tilt hammer was operated by an overshot waterwheel. Another overshot waterwheel worked bellows. In 1574, John Thorpe of Hedgecourt was working <b>the</b> <b>forge</b> in connection with the furnace at Myllwood. in 1586 Thorpe bought property from William Swanne Sr in <b>the</b> Woodcock <b>Forge</b> area. From 1598 to 1606 the rent was paid by Thomas Thorpe, son of John and in 1629 <b>the</b> <b>forge</b> was leased by John Gage to Richard Thorpe, the son of Thomas. His son, also Richard, held <b>the</b> <b>forge</b> until 1651, when it was forfeit in lieu of a debt. Thorpe's interest in <b>the</b> <b>forge</b> was sold to Simon Everenden of Cliffe near Lewes. In <b>the</b> 1650s <b>the</b> <b>forge</b> was in <b>the</b> occupation of John Newnham. In 1664, <b>the</b> <b>forge</b> was lease by Jeremy Johnson Jr of Charlwood. In 1672, woodland next to the pond was referred to as [...] "Hammerwood" [...] also known as [...] "Wire Wood" [...] thus indicating a drawing mill. John Newnham died in 1707, and his wife died in 1719, but <b>the</b> <b>forge</b> was known as [...] "Mr Johnson's Forge" [...] in 1717. At that time the output from <b>the</b> <b>forge</b> was some [...] per annum. [...] By 1729 <b>the</b> <b>forge</b> was in <b>the</b> occupation of Thomas Stanford, who was converting sows from Heathfield furnace at Woodcock Forge. Stanford does not seem to have had any connections with the Wealden iron industry after 1738. In 1742 Samuel Baker was in occupation, followed by Edward Raby and Alexander Master in 1758. They were supplying the Board of Ordnance with several gauges of bar iron, staff iron and rolled plate. Raby & Master were bankrupt in 1764. Edward Raby died in 1771, and <b>the</b> <b>forge</b> was taken over by his son Alexander until 1774, when the Government forced him to give up Woodcock furnace in a wrangle over the size of his moulds. Joseph Wright and Thomas Pickett took the business, but it is thought that the Hammer Mill ceased to be used c.1787. In 1800, the name Wire Mill is first used.|$|R
