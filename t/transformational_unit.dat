50|$|Syntax {{refers to}} the study of the {{structural}} organization of a sentence, or as Bernstein summarizes, “the actual structures that arise from that phonological stuff” (p. 9). In addition to syntax, Lecture 2 relies on Chomsky’s theory of universal grammar, which states that innate mental processes take place to transform sounds and words into meaningful structures. The theory seeks to explain the <b>transformational</b> processes small <b>units</b> of language take to become larger structures. Grammar is a key aspect in this process, because through the use of underlying grammatical rules, the mind is capable of combining phonemes into syntax. These resulting syntactic structures include linguistic material such as words, clauses, and sentences.|$|R

A criticism to the Astonkonzept (Kieser & Kubicek, 1992) locks the chapter, in which extensive historical bases are pointed out for structural development in public administrations. In the next section the bases are put to organizational learning and the organizational change. A historical excursion points out {{the development of the}} investigations and the most prominent beginnings. The concept from Wiegand (1996) is represented in detail and set into connection with the question of investigation. A special meaning is given to the model of Thom and Ritz (2000) about the readiness for innovation. The work continues in a chapter for transformational leadership. The development of the beginning of the theoretical origins (Burns, 1978) up to the instrument for the measurement of transformational leadership (Felfe & Goihl 2002), used in the available work, is introduced. The current discussion conditions are stated. The specific aspects of the leadership concept are opposite placed to those of other concepts and discussed critically. It is primarily shown a demarcation line to concepts of attribution, charisma concepts and the model of substitutes of leadership. The meaning of the transformational guidance for success organisationalen learning is put out. In the next section the representation of psychological relevant external criteria for the measurement of transformational leadership takes place. On the basis of short theoretical derivations it is pointed out why the external criteria are classified as relevant indicators for leadership success. External criteria are introduced to the image and for identification (readiness for innovation, work satisfaction, solidarity and identification as well as work motivation), for information (handicap by lack of information, regular discussion with the direct superiors, communication as well as lack of participation in decisions), for co-operation (communication as well as competition) and for subjective load feeling (impairment by high risk, complaints by the work as well as stress). The appropriate scales are examined critically regarding the control criteria. The theoretical section of the thesis ends with the representation of the questions: 1. The instrument for the measurement of transformational leadership (MLQ German version) is suitable for the investigation of leadership in public administrations. The instrument consists of nine scales which measures among other things transformational, transactional and laissez-faire behaviors. Here a highvalid separation between the five transformational and the three transactional scales results. 2. In the public administration a large range is shown regarding the extent of transformational, more transactional and laissez-faire leadership. From this it can be derived that in the public administration units exist with high-grade transformational estimated superiors. 3. <b>Transformational</b> led administrative <b>units</b> are more "successful" as not <b>transformational</b> led administrative <b>units.</b> Success manifests itself among other things in more positive estimates of co-operation, the more frequent participation in decisions or smaller risk perception. 4. "Successful" administrative units exhibit criteria of learning organizations. Criteria of learning organizations are operationalised on the individual level over high readiness for innovation and work satisfaction. The empirical part of the thesis begins with basic considerations for the further procedure and the representation of the sample (N = 1767). Detailed analyses are following (among other things cluster analyses, discriminance analyses, multiple regression analyses, variance and covariance analyses) between the guidance scales and the scales of the external criteria. Subsamples with and without guide function are differentiated. In {{the main part of the}} analyses on the basis of a cluster analysis two groups are formed. The one group exhibits high values regarding the work satisfaction and readiness for innovation, the other one is characterized in small values. Between these groups systematic differences are determined regarding the foreign evaluation of the extent of transformational leadership of the next high-level superior. The thesis ends with a result representation. The questions can be confirmed. In tables the praedictive qualities of the individual leadership scales are illustrated regarding the external criteria. The conclusion and a critical appreciation of the results with a research view close the work...|$|R
