5|$|Malawi {{is among}} the world's least {{developed}} countries. Around 85% of the population live in rural areas. The economy is based on agriculture, and more <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> GDP and 90% of export revenues come from this. In the past, {{the economy has been}} dependent on substantial economic aid from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and other countries. Malawi was ranked the 119th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings.|$|E

This represents less <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> the number of fans at WrestleMania VIII, which had an attendance of 62,167. The pay-per-view drew a 2.3 buyrate, which was lower than the previous year's 2.8 buyrate. It was higher, however, than the buyrates {{for any of the}} following four WrestleManias.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, Resident Evil: Afterlife {{opened in}} 30 countries, bumping Inception from {{first place and}} {{grossing}} $42.3 million from 3,559 screens with 3D screenings accounting for 81% of total earnings, thereby becoming the most successful overseas debut of the entire series. More <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> the total came from a $15.5 million three-day launch in Japan. Additionally, the film grossed $6.4 million in Russia, $3.3 million in Spain, $2.95 million in Taiwan and $2.6 million in the UK.

5|$|The 1964 Supreme Convention was {{scheduled}} to be held at the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans. A few days before the Convention, new Supreme Knight John W. McDevitt learned the hotel admitted only white guests, under the state's racial segregation policy. He threatened to move the Convention to another venue. The hotel changed its policy and so did the Order. The Convention amended the admissions rule to require that a new applicant could not be rejected by less <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> those voting. In 1972 the Supreme Convention amended its rules again, requiring a majority of members voting to reject a candidate.|$|E

He claimed that the actual death toll was two more than the official count, but authorities did not provide access to the list of casualties.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, UBS {{announced}} the planned cut of 8,700 jobs and had implemented a new compensation plan. Under the plan, no more <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> any cash bonus {{would be paid}} out in the year it is earned with the rest {{to be held in}} reserve and stock-based incentives that would vest after three years; top executives would have to hold 75% of any vested shares. Additionally, the bank's chairman, Peter Kurer, would no longer receive any extra variable compensation, only a cash salary and a fixed allotment of shares that could not be sold for four years. In April 2009, UBS announced that it agreed to sell its Brazilian financial services business, UBS Pactual, for approximately US$2.5billion to BTG Investments. UBS rejected proposals to break apart the bank and divest its investment banking division.|$|E
5|$|Madonna's {{performance}} was the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show in history, with 114million viewers– {{more than the}} game itself, which had 111.3million viewers. According to the Nielsen ratings, the show had a 47.4 household rating; among adults 18–49 it had a 41.5 rating, compared with the game average of 40.5. Reuters noted that the half-hour from 9:30 to 9:58 ET peaked at a 50.7 household rating and a 72 share, with 117.7 million viewers. The record was broken by Bruno Mars in 2014 (115 million) and Katy Perry in 2015 (118 million). Madonna set a record as the most-tweeted subject on Twitter (10,245 posts in one second, {{with an average of}} 8,000 tweets per second for five minutes) and was the most-searched term on Google during the show. Wired CEO Mark Ghuneim tweeted that less <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> the tweets were negative, 59 percent were positive and 11 percent were neutral. According to Billboard, the day after the show its ratings and economic impact were discussed.|$|E

50|$|Worship of Inari {{spread across}} Japan in the Edo period, {{and by the}} 16th century Inari had become the patron of blacksmiths and the {{protector}} of warriors. Inari is a popular figure in both Shinto and Buddhist beliefs in Japan. More <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> (32,000) <b>of</b> the Shinto shrines in Japan are dedicated to Inari.

5|$|One {{month after}} Croatia {{declared}} its independence, the Yugoslav army and other Serb forces held something less <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> the Croatian territory, mostly {{in areas with}} a predominantly ethnic Serb population. The JNA military strategy partly consisted of extensive shelling, at times irrespective {{of the presence of}} civilians. As the war progressed, the cities of Dubrovnik, Gospić, Šibenik, Zadar, Karlovac, Sisak, Slavonski Brod, Osijek, Vinkovci, and Vukovar all came under attack by Yugoslav forces. The United Nations (UN) imposed a weapons embargo; this did not affect JNA-backed Serb forces significantly, as they had the JNA arsenal at their disposal, but it caused serious trouble for the newly formed Croatian army. The Croatian government started smuggling weapons over its borders.|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{the hospice}} {{industry}} has rapidly expanded. This growth has accompanied the AIDS epidemic and {{the aging of}} the population, with related illnesses. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry, with $1.9 billion from Medicare alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs with Medicare certification. In that year, 72% of hospice providers were non-profit. By 1998, there were 3,200 hospices either in operation or under development throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, according to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO). According to 2007's Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System, hospice sites are expanding at a national rate of about 3.5% per year. In 2007, 1.4 million people in the United States used hospice, with more <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> dying Americans using the service, approximately 39%. In 2008, Medicare alone, which pays for 80% of hospice treatment, paid $10 billion to the 4,000 Medicare-certified providers in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way has a {{relatively}} low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond {{in order for the}} Milky Way to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. This makes the Milky Way difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon. The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> Earth's population cannot see the Milky Way from their homes due to light pollution.|$|E
40|$|Objective of {{this survey}} was to {{establish}} a baseline nutritional profile {{to assess the impact}} of the MNCH programme interventions at the end of the project duration. Nutritional status and related factors were assessed using different indicators- anthropometric status of under- 5 children, adolescent girls and adult women (non-pregnant aged 20 - 49 years), household food security, intra-householdfood distribution, knowledge of women on micronutrient and food during pregnancy and lactation. Data were collected from 1, 113 programme and 803 control households. Mean height, weight and MUAC of under-five children was similar in the programme and control households. More <b>than</b> half and <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> children were underweight and stunted respectively both in programme and control households. Mean weight, BMI and MUAC was comparable between both groups of adolescent girls. No significant difference was observed in height, weight, MUAC and BMI of non-pregnant women between programme and control households. More <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> women <b>of</b> both households were suffering from chronic energy deficiency. ...|$|R

Summers tend to be dry with less <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> that <b>of</b> the wettest winter month, and with less than 30mm (1.18 in) of precipitation in a summer month.|$|R
5|$|The {{economic}} impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world. In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 billion per year. Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter drugs and another $400 million on prescription medicines for symptom relief. More <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance. An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children. When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold, the total {{economic impact}} of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 billion per year. This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} the Aristarchus plateau has been the site of many {{reported}} transient lunar phenomena, {{with a total of}} 122 such reports by 2007; the highest recorded for any lunar feature. Such events include temporary obscurations and colorations of the surface, and catalogues of these show that more <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> the most reliable spottings come from this locale. In 1971 when Apollo 15 passed 110 kilometers above the Aristarchus plateau, a significant rise in alpha particles was detected. These particles are believed to be caused by the decay of radon-222, a radioactive gas with a half-life of only 3.8 days. The Lunar Prospector mission later confirmed radon-222 emissions from this crater. These observations could be explained by either the slow and visually imperceptible diffusion of gas to the surface, or by discrete explosive events.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Reynolds and Reynolds signed {{agreements}} {{with the rest of}} the Big Three automotive manufacturers, several major insurers, General Electric and others. In 1986 the company acquired National Medical Computer Services and a business forms company called Arnold Corporation. By the end of that year, Reynolds had more than $200 million in annual revenue, 42 percent of which came from business forms. Reynolds acquired several smaller technology companies in the 1990s and further developed its software products. Reynolds and Reynolds acquired PD Medical Systems in 1994, forming Reynolds Healthcare Systems. Reynolds Healthcare Systems in turn later acquired a business document company, Fiscal Information, which serves radiologists. From 1994 to 1996, David Holmes led the acquisition of several other business forms and computer businesses outside the automotive industry for a total of $155 million. By 2000, Reynolds and Reynolds had revenues of $800 million and more <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> its users were General Motors dealerships. It sold the Information Solutions Group (ISG), which primarily sold business forms and supplies to non-automotive companies, that year to the Carlyle Group for $360 million.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September 1944, {{troops of}} the {{division}} in Tetovo and Gostivar mutinied, killing their German officers and NCOs. By this time, the division numbered fewer than 7,000 men, which was less <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> its intended strength. Within two months of its initial deployment, 3,500 men had deserted. Himmler brought in 3,000–4,000 Kriegsmarine (German navy) personnel from Greece {{to make up the}} numbers, but this had little effect on the division's fighting ability. By the beginning of October 1944, the division's strength had fallen to about 4,900 men, fewer than 1,500 of whom were fit for combat. Schmidhuber held his men in contempt, and he, his superiors, and Fitzthum explained their failure to create an effective security force by denigrating the Albanian culture and military reputation. Later, less-involved members of the Wehrmacht stated that the principal issue regarding the unit's reliability may have been that the Germans did not work closely with the Albanians at the local level. In mid-October, it was engaged in heavy fighting around Đakovica. By this time, desertions had significantly affected the division's strength and its 86 officers and 467 NCOs were left with a force of only 899 men, about half of whom were Albanian. On 24 October, Generaloberst Alexander Löhr, the commander of Army Group E, ordered that all Albanian members of the division be disarmed and released.|$|E
