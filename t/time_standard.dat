5|$|The {{piezoelectric}} {{properties of}} crystalline quartz were discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880. The first quartz crystal oscillator {{was built by}} Walter G. Cady in 1921, and in 1927 the first quartz clock was built by Warren Marrison and J. W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Canada. The following decades saw the development of quartz clocks as precision time measurement devices in laboratory settings—the bulky and delicate counting electronics, built with vacuum tubes, limited their practical use elsewhere. In 1932, a quartz clock able to measure small weekly variations in the rotation rate of the Earth was developed. The National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the <b>time</b> <b>standard</b> of the United States on quartz clocks from late 1929 until the 1960s, when it changed to atomic clocks. In 1969, Seiko produced the world's first quartz wristwatch, the Astron. Their inherent accuracy and low cost of production {{has resulted in the}} subsequent proliferation of quartz clocks and watches.|$|E
5|$|Grabbed by the Ghoulies is a 3D action-adventure {{game with}} {{platforming}} elements. Breaking with {{the style of}} previous Rare platformers, the gameplay is simple in design, utilising the premise of moving through areas of the game's mansion and completing the required beat 'em up challenges in each room. Such challenges include eliminating all ghouls in a room, beating only a specified kind of ghoul while avoiding eliminating the rest or defeating a boss before the player-character, Cooper, can continue. All combat and melee attacks are manoeuvred by the control sticks, whereas the game's camera can be rotated by both triggers. When the player fails a challenge or takes longer than a set time limit to complete one, the Grim Reaper chases after the player-character; the Reaper will rip out Cooper's soul if the character does not leave the room in <b>time.</b> <b>Standard</b> enemies in the game include zombies, mummies, imps, skeletons and zombie pirates. There are also various bosses that must be defeated in order to advance. Many objects in the game with which the character can interact—including chairs, knives, and axes—can be used as weapons.|$|E
25|$|Officially, Xinjiang is on {{the same}} time zone {{as the rest of}} China, Beijing Time (UTC+8). However, being roughly two time zones west of the capital, some residents, local {{organization}} and local government follow another <b>time</b> <b>standard</b> known as Xinjiang Time (UTC+6). The division follows ethnic lines, with Han tending to use Beijing Time and Uyghurs tending to use Xinjiang Time; this is seen as a form of resistance to the central government. But regardless of preference in which <b>time</b> <b>standard,</b> most businesses and schools open and close two hours later than their equivalents in other regions of China.|$|E

25|$|Her {{interest}} in obstetrics began after working with new mothers in hospital.

After talking about her experiences at the hospital {{with one of her}} part-time private patients, she learned of Grantly Dick-Read's book Natural Childbirth. She was unable to meet Read or other like-minded individuals because of the outbreak of World War II, so she taught herself as much as she could about obstetrics.|$|E

25|$|Rolex {{produced}} specific models {{suitable for}} the extremes of deep-sea diving, caving, mountain climbing, polar exploration, and aviation. Early sports models included the Rolex Submariner (1953) and the Rolex Oyster Perpetual Date Sea Dweller. The latter watch has a helium release valve, co-invented with Swiss watchmaker Doxa, to release helium gas build-up during decompression. The Explorer (1953) and Explorer II (1971) were developed specifically for explorers who would navigate rough terrain, such as the world-famous Mount Everest expeditions. Another iconic model is the Rolex GMT Master (1954), originally developed {{at the request of}} Pan Am Airways to provide its crews with a dual time watch {{that could be used to}} display GMT (Greenwich Mean Time), which was the international <b>time</b> <b>standard</b> for aviation at that time and was needed for Astronavigation during longer flights.|$|E
25|$|The UTC <b>time</b> <b>standard,</b> {{which is}} widely used for {{international}} timekeeping and as the reference for civil time in most countries, uses the international system (SI) definition of the second, based on atomic clocks. Like most time standards, UTC defines a grouping of seconds into minutes, hours, days, months, and years. However, the duration of one mean solar day is now slightly longer (by roughly 0.001 seconds) than 24 hours (86400 SI seconds) because {{the rotation of the}} Earth has slowed down. Therefore, if the UTC day were defined as precisely 86400 SI seconds, the UTC time-of-day would slowly drift apart from that of solar-based standards, such as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and its successor UT1. The purpose of a leap second is to compensate for this drift, by occasionally scheduling some UTC days with 86401 or (in principle) 86399 SI seconds.|$|E
25|$|Units {{of length}} were systematized by Edward II who in 1324 defined the inch as being three barleycorns, the foot as twelve inches, the yard as three feet, the perch five and half yards and the acre {{as being an}} area four perches in width by forty perches in length. Apart from the ell (45inches or 114.3cm) which {{continued}} {{to be used in}} the cloth trade and the chain which was introduced by Edmund Gunter in 1620, these units formed the basis of the units of length of the English system of measurement. The units were however redefined many times – during Henry VIII's <b>time</b> <b>standard</b> yards and ells made of brass were manufactured, during Elizabeth I's time these were replaced with standards made of bronze and in 1742, after scientific comparisons showed a variation of up to 0.2% from the mean, a definitive standard yard was proposed (but not manufactured).|$|E

They had a second straight 4–0 league win, this time at home against FC Groningen, the following Sunday with goals by four different players. Feyenoord climbed to the top half of the table on 18 October when they beat Heracles Almelo 2–1 at home after two goals by Manu. They played Rijeka away in the Europa League on 23 October, a game they lost 3–1, with all goals coming after half time. This placed them last in the group, two points from the leaders, at the half-way mark of the group matches. Feyenoord climbed to third place in the league table on 26 October with their fourth straight league win. They beat SC Cambuur 1–0 on the road with a first half Toornstra goal.|$|E
25|$|In August 2013, DCFEMS {{reported}} that it had significantly lowered EMS response times in April, May, June, and July 2013. The department said its standard was {{to respond to a}} call (e.g., leave the station) within 6.5 minutes 90 percent of the time. The department lowered its response time from 84 percent of the time in February 2013 to 92 percent of the time in June 2013. The response time for critical calls (about half of those received every day) also fell, from 5:03 minutes in February 2013 to 4:02 minutes in June 2013. Ellerbe attributed the improvements to a new protocol that required ambulance crews and firefighter EMTs to submit paperwork justifying the response time every time it exceeded the standard. Ellerbe suggested that some employees were simply not responding very quickly, and noted that at least one employee was disciplined {{for not being able to}} justify a slow response time. The firefighters' union complained about the amount of paperwork required, and said crews were sacrificing safety in order to meet the response <b>time</b> <b>standard.</b> The union claimed there had been a sharp rise in minor road accidents since Ellerbe's protocol went into effect, and that some crews were lying when they said they had responded.|$|E
