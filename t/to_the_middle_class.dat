5|$|During the Edo period Noh {{continued}} to be aristocratic art form supported by the shogun, the feudal lords (daimyōs), as well as wealthy and sophisticated commoners. While kabuki and joruri popular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> focused on new and experimental entertainment, Noh strived to preserve its established high standards and historic authenticity and remained mostly unchanged throughout the era. To {{capture the essence of}} performances given by great masters, every detail in movements and positions was reproduced by others, generally resulting in an increasingly slow, ceremonial tempo over time.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} between World War I and World War II, {{many of the old}} mansions were hastily {{converted}} into apartments to house the growing labor supply, a practice encouraged by the federal government at the time through low-interest loans. However, after World War II, with the housing shortage solved by large-scale suburban development affordable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> vacancy rates in Old Louisville surged. To attract renters, landlords had to lower rents dramatically, attracting less affluent tenants with less funds to maintain the homes.|$|E

After Panday {{returned}} to India from Canada, he joined the King Edward Memorial Hospital and Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College (KEM), in which he performed hundreds of open heart surgeries. The hospital was run on a government grant and generally catered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> and poor, as the surgery was {{at the cost of}} the government. The hospital was {{one of the very few}} places in India where heart surgery was performed. Panday was the chief of the second unit at KEM.|$|E

5|$|Princess Victoria {{soon came}} to hate Conroy who bullied and insulted her, mocking her {{economical}} habits. Some historians have conjectured that Conroy's arrogant behaviour towards Victoria may have {{stemmed from a}} personal belief that his wife Elizabeth was secretly the illegitimate child of the Duke of Kent. While the rumour was later proven false, Conroy's strong ambition may have stemmed from this self-perceived connection to the aristocracy. Ambition {{may also have been}} influenced by Conroy's claim of descent from the ancient kings of Ireland. Regardless of his claims of grandeur, Conroy belonged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> and recognised the growing power of this group within British society.|$|E
5|$|The new ruler, Gheorghe Bibescu, {{released}} Bălcescu {{and other}} {{participants in the}} plot during 1843; soon afterwards, they became involved in founding a new Freemason-inspired secret society, known as Frăția ("The Brotherhood"), which was {{to serve as the}} central factor in the revolution. Early on, Frățias nucleus was formed by Bălcescu, Ion Ghica, Alexandru G. Golescu, and Major Christian Tell; by spring 1848, the leadership also included Dimitrie and Ion Brătianu, Constantin Bălcescu, Ștefan and Nicolae Golescu, Gheorghe Magheru, C. A. Rosetti, Ion Heliade Rădulescu, and Ioan Voinescu II. It was especially successful in Bucharest, where it also reached out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> and kept a legal facade as Soțietatea Literară (the Literary Society), whose meetings were attended by the Moldavians Vasile Alecsandri, Mihail Kogălniceanu, and Costache Negruzzi, {{as well as by the}} Austrian subject Constantin Daniel Rosenthal. During the early months of 1848, Romanian students at the University of Paris, including the Brătianu brothers, witnessed and, in some cases, took part in the French republican uprising.|$|E

25|$|Advances {{in public}} health caused an {{explosion}} of population growth, {{making it difficult to}} provide social services.

25|$|In {{their social}} {{structure}} Russians differed from most other nationalities in Latvia.

25|$|As {{the capital}} of the new kingdom, Brussels also {{attracted}} a large number of Walloon migrants. In contrast to Flemish citizens of Brussels, who came primarily from the lower social classes, the Walloon newcomers belonged mainly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> The Walloon and French migrants lived predominantly in the Marollen district of Brussels, where Marols, a mixture of Brabantian Dutch, French, and Walloon, was spoken. Despite the fact that many lower-class Walloons also made their way to Brussels, the perception of French as an intellectual and elite language did not change.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to bringing industry <b>to</b> Carnoustie, <b>the</b> {{opening of the}} railway also made <b>the</b> town appealing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes,</b> who {{used it as a}} commuter town for Dundee, further boosting population growth in the town.

25|$|In sociology, <b>the</b> upper <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> is <b>the</b> {{social group}} {{constituted}} by higher status members of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> This {{is in contrast}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> term lower <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> which {{is used for the}} group {{at the opposite end of}} the middle-class stratum, and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> broader term <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> There is considerable debate as <b>to</b> how <b>the</b> upper <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> might be defined.

25|$|While {{endorsing}} {{some aspects}} of Dobrogeanu-Gherea's theories regarding {{the ways in which}} serfdom was allegedly prolonged, in a discreet form, even after the 20th century, Pătrășcanu challenged his refusal to investigate the effects of capitalism in rural areas. According to Pătrășcanu, the establishment of estate leaseholders, which he viewed as the cause for the 1907 revolt and other, more minor, peasant rebellions, was not a sign of prolonged feudalism, but one of capitalist penetration into agriculture. Contradicting the Social Democratic ideologists Lothar Rădăceanu and Șerban Voinea (whom he accused of having lost contact with the working class), Pătrășcanu theorized that the Romanian petite bourgeoisie was shrinking under pressure from successful capitalists, while rejecting the notion that civil servants belonged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E

25|$|A Turkish revival movement, the Young Turks {{took control}} of the {{government}} in 1913; they mobilized the country's society for war, employing numerous political and economic reforms. The Committee of Union and Progress, through its Committee of National Defense, fostered pan-Turkish nationalism based in Anatolia. The Young Turks created new organizations, such as the Ottoman Red Crescent Society, the Ottoman Navy League, and the Committee of National Defense, to extend their political influence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> to mobilize support for the war effort and to construct a Turkish identity. When the war broke out the sultan, in his capacity, as caliph, issued a jihad, calling all Muslims in Egypt, India and other Allied colonies to revolt against their Christian rulers. Very few listened. Meanwhile, many Arabs turned against the Turkish rulers of the Empire and collaborated with the British.|$|E

500|$|Looking back at {{the defeat}} of the {{incumbent}} Social Democrats, the opinion among several members of the defeated incumbents was that the election was lost because the previous government failed to bring down unemployment, and failed to campaign on it as an issue. Ardalan Shekarabi, the former chairman for the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League, stated that [...] "the Moderates were right strategically to focus on unemployment". Former Social Democratic minister Leif Pagrotsky stated that internal fighting, authoritarianism and perceived aggressiveness as well as a loss of appeal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> and city inhabitants contributed to the election loss.|$|E
500|$|Notwithstanding {{their high}} price, the {{popularity}} of Bovet watches in China meant {{that the company had}} to contract with other Swiss manufacturers such as Guinand to help them meet demand. [...] Even though Juvet Fleurier also sold pieces in China, it was not uncommon to see Bovet pieces with a Juvet movement. [...] In the 1830s Bovet established a manufacturing facility in Canton, but because of restrictions resulting from the Opium Wars, they had to close that facility and open a smaller one in Macau. [...] It was about this time that the company created a Chinese name to more effectively market <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> The Chinese name for Bovet, [...] "Bo Wei", became a common noun for watches in China for many years.|$|E
500|$|In {{many ways}} the Rights of Woman is inflected by a bourgeois view of the world, as is its direct {{predecessor}} the Rights of Men.

She also frequently praises modesty and industry, virtues which, at the time, {{were associated with the}} middle class. From her position as a middle-class writer arguing for a middle-class ethos, Wollstonecraft also attacks the wealthy, criticizing them using the same arguments she employs against women. She points out the [...] "false-refinement, immorality, and vanity" [...] of the rich, calling them [...] "weak, artificial beings, raised above the common wants and affections of their race, in a premature unnatural manner [...] undermine the very foundation of virtue, and spread corruption through the whole mass of society".|$|E
