40|$|The paper {{provides}} a comparative overview of models of <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> adulthood in European countries. <b>Transition</b> <b>to</b> adulthood {{is defined as}} a process of multifold status change in key domains of life. Indicators of transition include education, professional, family and residential markers. Individual <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> adulthood is influenced by external determinants such as welfare system, family relations, housing conditions, and value orientations (notably in family transition). Current research in this field provides evidence for provisionary mapping of transitional paths. A very common classification differentiates between Nordic, West European and South European types of <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> adulthood. There is also an alternative categorization, based on geographic, social and political dimensions. The model comprises member states of the EU, ex-communist countries, and Balkan countries. In the final segment of the paper, <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> adulthood in Serbia is discussed in more detail. We compare indicators of <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> adulthood, and focus on both diverging and converging trends in <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> adulthood in Serbia and the EU. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Transition</b> <b>to</b> Specialty Practice Programs was {{introduced}} <b>to</b> facilitate the <b>transition</b> of nurses <b>to</b> specialty practice, and is recognised as preparatory for emergency nurses. Emergency nursing <b>Transition</b> <b>to</b> Specialty Practice Programs and their characteristics have developed locally {{in response to}} unit needs. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the characteristics of emergency nursing <b>Transition</b> <b>to</b> Specialty Practice Programs in Australia, and identify which characteristics were associated with improved professional development outcomes. METHODS: An explanatory sequential design was used. Data were collected via online surveys and interviews of emergency Nurse Managers and Nurse Educators. <b>Transition</b> <b>to</b> Specialty Practice Program characteristics were compared using Mann Whitney U and Chi-Square tests. Content analysis was used to analyse qualitative data. RESULTS: Survey data were collected from 118 emergency departments, and 13 interviews were conducted. <b>Transition</b> <b>to</b> Specialty Practice Programs were offered in most emergency departments (n= 80, 72. 1 %), with one or two intakes per year. <b>Transition</b> <b>to</b> Specialty Practice Program characteristics varied; duration ranged from 5 - 12 months, clinical preparation time ranged from 7 - 22 days, and the number of study days provided ranged from 2 - 6. When <b>Transition</b> <b>to</b> Specialty Practice Programs of 6 and 12 months duration were compared, there was no difference in the content covered. Emergency departments with 12 month <b>Transition</b> <b>to</b> Specialty Practice Programs had lower percentages of Clinical Specialists (9 % vs 18 %, p= 0. 03) and postgraduate qualified nurses (30. 5 % vs 43. 8 %, p= 0. 09). CONCLUSION: The target participants, duration and clinical preparation of <b>Transition</b> <b>to</b> Specialty Practice Programs participants varied, impeding workforce mobility and articulation to postgraduate study and there were no professional development advantages from longer programs. There is an urgent need for a nationally consistent, evidence-based and fiscally responsible approach <b>to</b> <b>Transition</b> <b>to</b> Specialty Practice Programs...|$|R

King's evidence includes slave narratives, ex-slave interviews collected by the Works Progress Administration (WPA), plantation owner diaries, census records, newspapers, autobiographies, missionary reports, and Freedmen's Bureau records. She contrasts Northern and Southern slave life, as well as their ownership by whites, blacks, and Native Americans.|$|E
