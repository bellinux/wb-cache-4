500|$|They planned their setlist at the Connaught Hotel in London, {{followed}} by {{three days of}} rehearsals at Black Island Studios. The sessions were problematic, with minor disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order decided {{on the eve of}} the event. At the beginning of their performance of [...] "Wish You Were Here", Waters told the audience: [...] " [...] quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these years, standing to be counted with the rest of you... we're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd." [...] At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage. Waters then called him back, and the band shared a group hug. Images of that hug were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8. Waters commented on their almost twenty years of animosity: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> came out of the years from 1985 with any credit... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity." ...|$|E

I {{acknowledge}} that I have not closed an eye; I do not <b>think</b> that <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have done so." ...|$|R

The {{chances are that}} he is some half-demented {{castaway}} who will forget us more quickly, but no more surely, than we shall forget him. He is only a beast of the jungle, Miss Porter." ...|$|R
500|$|Several {{songs from}} the band's third album, Vitalogy, were premiered during this tour. The band's April 3, 1994 concert in Atlanta, Georgia at the Fox Theatre was {{broadcast}} live on the radio in the United States. A few days later, the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found in his home in Seattle due to an apparent suicide, which deeply affected Vedder. At the band's April 8, 1994 concert in Fairfax, Virginia at the Patriot Center, Vedder proclaimed, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would be in this room tonight if it weren't for Kurt Cobain." [...] Vedder later said that [...] "the day that we found out about Kurt... I was just spinning. I was lost and didn't know if we should play, or if we should just go home, or if we should attend the services. I still have some regrets about that, even though {{in the end it}} was probably better that we played the last two weeks of the tour. I decided I would play those next two weeks and then I'd never have to play again." ...|$|E
500|$|Victoria Principal {{has said}} that she feels Pam changed {{throughout}} the course of the series. She commented, [...] "Pam didn’t have two parents, her father was a drunkard, and she really had to fight for everything she aspired to and achieved. When Bobby married her, he wasn’t marrying milk toast; she was very, very spirited; she was always a good person. I always felt Pam was the moral centre of the programme but she was complicated, and she was fiery, she had opinions, and she was not afraid to voice them. But as the years went by, as JR became more and more evil, the writers felt, and I certainly understand why {{for the benefit of the}} show, that Pam had to become more and more good." [...] When asked about whether she had any input on her characters growth, she said: [...] "Once the show achieved extraordinary world wide fame, I don’t <b>think</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had much input. [...] You know the old saying, if it's not broken, don’t fix it; I really believe that Lorimar Television looked upon it as something that was working and they did not want to deviate from the formula." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Spice Up Your Life" [...] was {{directed}} on 6 September 1997, by Marcus Nispel in a two-day shoot located in New York City. The video features {{the group in}} a futuristic setting, inspired by the 1982 film Blade Runner, and the music video for Janet Jackson's 1989 single Rhythm Nation controlling every aspect of society in a dark futuristic post apocalyptic cityscape. Nispel {{came up with the}} concept based on a sketch that was faxed to him signed [...] "Ginger Spice". He recalls: [...] "I looked at what Disney did to Times Square in NYC and tried to imagine how the Spice Girls would transform it, as their career seemed to have no limits—at the time." [...] The group was not consulted about the concept. According to Brown's autobiography, they wanted a carnival party theme, but were too tired to fight about it with the label, and ended up with a concept linked to the theme of world domination. Brown commented: [...] "It wasn't right. I don't <b>think</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> liked it much, even though we enjoyed making it. I still can't understand what's going on in it half the time." [...] The video exclusively premiered on MTV in September 1997.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not; {{and as for}} us, {{we would}} {{strangle}} ourselves in prison, did we <b>think</b> that <b>any</b> thought <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would turn our father from his noble purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The news quite {{took all}} our breath away, Millicent," [...] {{one of them}} said. [...] "It seems {{extraordinary}} {{that you should have}} been Miss Thorndyke all the time, though I don't <b>think</b> that <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were at all surprised that you should take the name now; you must have been surprised when you heard that you were the heiress of Crowswood." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he remembered}} and walked away, and {{presently}} we marched forward {{as though nothing}} had happened. Only from that moment I do not <b>think</b> that <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> worried ourselves about the Kalubi and what might befall him. Still, looking back on the thing, I {{think that there was}} this excuse to be made for the man. He was mad with the fear of death and knew not what he did.|$|R
500|$|The series {{features}} numerous song covers sung onscreen by the characters. Ryan Murphy {{was responsible}} for selecting all of the songs used, and {{has said that he}} strove to maintain a balance between chart hits and show tunes: [...] "I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very important—the balancing of that." [...] According to Murphy, the song choices are integral to script development, [...] "Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along." [...] In a 2010 interview with Allison Kugel, Chris Colfer noted that [...] "there have been a couple of times when I have gone to Ryan Murphy (Glee creator) and told him {{a couple of things that}} have happened to me, and then he writes it into the show. Or he'll ask me what song I would want to sing, in this situation or in that situation. I don’t <b>think</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> directly try to give input on the character or on the storyline, but they definitely steal things from us." [...] For the second season, a shift toward using more Top 40 songs was seen, in an effort to appeal more to the 18–49 demographic.|$|E
500|$|While filming was {{underway}} {{for the seventh}} season, {{many members of the}} crew felt that the show had entered into its final season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later explained, [...] "There was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show {{that it was time to}} call it a day." [...] Because the show's producers felt that the show was nearing its end, many story arcs were ended in the season. The fourth episode, [...] "Millennium" [...] was written as a way to bring closure to the recently cancelled Carter-created series of the same name. The episode features Lance Henriksen reprising his role as Frank for the last time. The eleventh episode, [...] "Closure", features Mulder discovering what happened to his sister. The idea to close the story arc received mixed reactions from various production and crew members. However, many of the show's producers realized that the time had come to answer one of the show's biggest questions. Paul Rabwin noted that, [...] "It's been seven years. I don't <b>think</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are going to miss Samantha Mulder. That device and motivation were very strong in the early years of the show. But as the years have gone by, the speculation kind of melted away." [...] As the season progressed, however, the idea of producing another season emerged. Paul Rabwin explained that, [...] "we found ourselves starting to get energized again. [...] As we got toward the end of the season, everyone was kind of hopeful." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band's {{first song}} written {{together}} was [...] "Conspiracy", which was later used on their debut album. At this time, they were touring the southeast, usually {{being driven by}} Williams' parents. She commented that [...] "Back then, I guess we were all thinking, after school we'll go {{to the house and}} practice. It was what we loved to do for fun, and still do! I don't <b>think</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> really knew this {{would turn out to be}} what it's become." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps you are {{a little}} morbid, Mrs. Chance--forgive me for saying it. For after all {{what does it matter}} what people say or <b>think</b> about <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us?</b> I dare say that if your husband had by chance invented a new button- hook or something, and had been paid fifty {{thousand}} pounds for the patent, or if someone had died and left him a fortune, people would have seen all the good that was in him and more." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hibbitt {{also noted}} that the band will not record a fifth studio album: [...] "We’d have to change our lives so much to put {{ourselves}} in a position where we’d make a good Hundred Reasons record. We could toss off an average Hundred Reasons record, but there’s no desire to do that. I don’t <b>think</b> that <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> want to do it full-time again. We’re being realistic. Six months of hard work to make an album is not really on the cards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} see {{you looking}} so much better," [...] the captain said as they entered. [...] "Sit down. Do you know," [...] he went on with a smile, [...] "I do not <b>think</b> that <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would have slept had you not {{recovered}} sufficiently to tell your story to-night. We have been puzzling over it in vain. How you two boys came to be adrift alone on a raft, made up of three water-kegs, as Mr. Armstrong tells me, and how you came to have two bugles with you on the raft, is altogether beyond us." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a post-show {{interview}} clip on Austin City Limits, guitarist Munaf Rayani {{said about}} {{their status as}} instrumentalists, [...] "I mean, I think we discussed singing for half a second, {{and then it just}} kinda, we just dropped it. We just didn't go back to it because we were comfortable enough." [...] Drummer Chris Hrasky added, [...] "I think we just liked the idea of a band that there was not a leader or main songwriter, everyone sort of collaborating and has their own say. I don't <b>think</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> want the sort of 'leader role', so a leaderless band is kind of the best option for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Christopher Walken, the {{historical}} context was not paramount: [...] "In the making of it, I don't remember anyone ever mentioning Vietnam!" [...] De Niro added to this sentiment: [...] "Whether [...] actually happened or not, it's something you could imagine very easily happening. Maybe it did. I don't know. All's fair in love and war." [...] Producer Spikings, while proud of the film, regrets the way the Vietnamese were portrayed. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> meant it to be exploitive," [...] Spikings said. [...] "But I think we were... ignorant. I can't {{think of a better}} word for it. I didn't realize how badly we'd behaved to the Vietnamese people..." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 14, 2012, former Guns N' Roses members Slash, Duff McKagan, Gilby Clarke, Steven Adler and Matt Sorum all reunited at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The group {{performed}} [...] "Mr. Brownstone", [...] "Sweet Child o' Mine", and [...] "Paradise City" [...] with Alter Bridge and Slash's band vocalist Myles Kennedy in Rose's absence. Slash {{mentioned in}} an interview that [...] "All things considered, I don't <b>think</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{wanted to be a part}} of it initially, didn't <b>think</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were going to go. It was a thorn in everybody's—well, at least a thorn in my side—because I was busy doing other stuff. When it finally came down to the wire at the very, very, very last-minute—I'm talking about the 11 hours and 30 seconds mark—Axl had pulled out." [...] In the same interview, Slash mentioned the prospects of a reunion, stating [...] "It's not even something I like to dwell on. I don't even like to make comments because you end up with quotes that sometimes exacerbate the issue. I've got other things going on. I'm very, very proud—endlessly proud—of everything the band stood for and everything that's gone on with it." [...] Slash then stated in a July 2012 interview that [...] " [...] will 'never reunite'". In a later interview, former drummer Steven Adler stated that Matt Sorum would not take part in a potential reunion unless Adler was involved. Duff McKagan said in 2015, [...] " [...] could happen, and it could not. And I think it would be wonderful, one day, if we reconciled, first and foremost. That alone would be cool." ...|$|E
60|$|In an {{incredibly}} short time the whole consignment was delivered; {{and the men}} departed with a douceur for each, given through their foreman, which made them effusive in their thanks. Then we all went to our own rooms. There was a strange confidence over us all. I do not <b>think</b> that <b>any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had a doubt as the the quiet passing of {{the remainder of the}} night.|$|R
60|$|That {{night we}} all went to bed early. The next night would be an anxious one, and Mr. Trelawny thought {{that we should all}} be {{fortified}} with what sleep we could get. The day, too, would be full of work. Everything in connection with the Great Experiment would have to be gone over, so that at the last we might not fail from any unthought-of flaw in our working. We made, of course, arrangements for summoning aid in case such should be needed; but I do not <b>think</b> that <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had <b>any</b> real apprehension <b>of</b> danger. Certainly we had no fear of such danger from violence as we had had to guard against in London during Mr. Trelawny's long trance.|$|R
60|$|When Mr. Trelawny had gone, silence reigned. I do not <b>think</b> that <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{wanted to}} talk. Presently Margaret {{went to her}} room, and I {{went out on the}} terrace over the sea. The fresh air and the beauty of all before helped to restore the good spirits which I had known earlier in the day. Presently I felt myself {{actually}} rejoicing in the belief that the danger which I had feared from the Queen's violence on the coming night was obviated. I believed in Margaret's belief so thoroughly that it did not occur to me to dispute her reasoning. In a lofty frame of mind, and with less anxiety than I had felt for days, I went to my room and lay down on the sofa.|$|R
2500|$|On several occasions, Umarov firmly {{denied any}} {{involvement}} in indiscriminate attacks against civilians and questioned its legitimacy and value. In a June 2005 interview with Andrei Babitsky, he criticized Basayev for ordering the Beslan raid, saying {{that most of the}} Chechen resistance does not consider the Beslan hostage taking was a legitimate response to Russian actions in Chechnya ("if we resort to such methods, I do not <b>think</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> will be able to retain his human face"). Umarov's controversial appointment of Basayev to the post of prime minister in 2006 was precedeed by a public statement rejecting attacks against civilians as a tactic. In another statement in 2004 Umarov wrote: [...] "Our targets are the Russian occupation forces, their military bases, command headquarters and also their local collaborationists who pursue and kill peaceful Muslims. Civil objects and innocent civilians are not our targets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't see it, Jim. I don't <b>think</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> saw it. We {{were all}} too much {{occupied}} {{looking for the}} trail. Another time, {{you tell me what}} you see without my asking.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, none {{especially}} clever. We do some magic, of course, {{but it is}} all of {{the ordinary}} kind. I do not <b>think</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> has yet aspired to stealing Rulers, either by magic or otherwise." ...|$|E
60|$|While occupying {{this house}} I do not <b>think</b> that <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{endeavored}} to pry {{into the private}} concerns of the family who owned it, although we each had a very natural curiosity {{to know something about}} said family. Opportunities of acquiring such knowledge, however, were exceedingly scarce. Even if we had been willing to look into such receptacles, the several desks and secretaries that the house contained were all locked, and nowhere could Mrs. Lecks or Mrs. Aleshine find an old letter or piece of wrapping-paper with an address on it. I explained to my companions that letters and packages were not likely to come to a place like this, but they kept a sharp lookout for anything of the kind, asserting that there could be no possible harm in reading the names of the people whose house they were in.|$|R
40|$|I want {{to reflect}} on what we have heard here today, and {{over the course of}} the last several weeks, about John Pickering. We have heard simply {{remarkable}} things about a remarkable man of consequence. He was not just a remarkable person. He was more than that. He was a remarkable person who did things that actually changed everyone 2 ̆ 7 s lives. He mattered. We heard a lot of things today and some of them we heard for the first time. But I do not <b>think</b> that <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> was surprised to hear <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them about John Pickering. We just did not know all of them. There are a lot of other things that we do not know about John Pickering, but I do not think that we are going to be surprised when we hear some of those other things either...|$|R
60|$|Only somehow I don't <b>think</b> that <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> really {{believed}} {{that we should}} die, though whether this was because we had all, except poor Quick, survived so much, or from a sneaking faith in Maqueda's optimistic dreams, I cannot say. At any rate we ate our food with appetite, took exercise in an inner yard of the prison, and strove to grow as strong as we could, feeling that soon we might need all our powers. Oliver was the most miserable among us, not for his own sake, but because, poor fellow, he was haunted with fears as to Maqueda and her fate, although of these he said {{little or nothing to}} us. On the other hand, my son Roderick was by far the most cheerful. He had lived for so many years upon the brink of death that this familiar gulf seemed to have no terrors for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "But for {{you there}} {{would not have been}} any battle at all," [...] Field said. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would have gone forward after that fellow warned us back had you not done so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you might}} do that, Tim, but as we've no bacon here, that won't help us. No, we must {{put up with the}} cook, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> will be the worse for the dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{have thought}} of blaming you in the matter, Mr. Tallboys. I am sure that I have not. You could not {{possibly}} have foreseen that Mr. Penfold's sisters were likely to turn out thieves." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{extremely}} difficult to estimate, in a proper way, the importance and the working of the Conditions of Existence. I do not <b>think</b> there were <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who had the remotest notion of properly estimating them until the publication of Mr. Darwin's work, which has placed them before us with remarkable clearness; and I must endeavour, as far as I can in my own fashion, to give you some notion of how they work. We shall find it easiest to take a simple case, and one as free as possible from every kind of complication.|$|R
6000|$|... "Set one of Mrs. Michelson's {{opinions}} fairly {{against the}} other," [...] he said, [...] "and {{try to be}} reasonable about a perfectly plain matter. If {{she had not been}} well enough to be moved do you <b>think</b> we should <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have risked letting her go? She has got three competent people to look after her--Fosco and your aunt, and Mrs. Rubelle, who went away with them expressly for that purpose. They took a whole carriage yesterday, and made a bed for her on the seat in case she felt tired. To-day, Fosco and Mrs. Rubelle go on with her themselves to Cumberland." ...|$|R
5000|$|The antiwar and anti {{government}} {{feelings in}} the book belong to the period following World War II: the Korean War, the cold war of the Fifties. A general disintegration of belief took place then, and it affected Catch-22 in that {{the form of the}} novel became almost disintegrated. Catch-22 was a collage; if not in structure, then in the ideology of the novel itself ... Without being aware of it, I was part of a near-movement in fiction. While I was writing Catch-22, J. P. Donleavy was writing The Ginger Man, Jack Kerouac was writing On the Road, Ken Kesey was writing One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, Thomas Pynchon was writing V., and Kurt Vonnegut was writing Cats Cradle. I dont <b>think</b> <b>any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> even knew <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the others. Certainly I didnt know them. Whatever forces were at work shaping a trend in art were affecting not just me, but all <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> The feelings <b>of</b> helplessness and persecution in Catch-22 are very strong in Cats Cradle.|$|R
