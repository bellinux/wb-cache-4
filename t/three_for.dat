40|$|BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors may foster {{intestinal}} dysbiosis {{and related}} bowel symptoms. AIM: To evaluate {{the effect of}} Lactobacillus paracasei F 19 on bowel symptom onset in patients on long-term proton pump inhibitors. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with typical gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms receiving pantoprazole 40 mg/d for six months {{were randomly assigned to}} receive: (A) Lactobacillus paracasei F 19 bid <b>for</b> <b>three</b> days/week <b>for</b> six months; (B) placebo bid <b>for</b> <b>three</b> days/week <b>for</b> six months; (C) Lactobacillus paracasei F 19 bid <b>for</b> <b>three</b> days/week <b>for</b> <b>three</b> months and placebo bid <b>for</b> <b>three</b> days/week <b>for</b> the following <b>three</b> months; (D) placebo bid <b>for</b> <b>three</b> days/week <b>for</b> <b>three</b> months and Lactobacillus paracasei F 19 bid <b>for</b> <b>three</b> days/week <b>for</b> the following <b>three</b> months. Bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain and bowel habit were assessed monthly. RESULTS: 100 / 312 patients were enrolled. In the parallel groups, the treatment-by-time interaction affected bloating (p = 0. 015), while Lactobacillus paracasei F 19 treatment alone affected flatulence (p = 0. 011). Moreover, the treatment-by-time interaction significantly affected the mean score of bloating (p = 0. 01) and flatulence (p < 0. 0001), the mean stool form (p = 0. 03) and mean stool frequency/week (p = 0. 016). Analysis of the cross-over groups, limited to the first three months because of carry-over effect, confirmed these results. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus paracasei F 19 supplementation prevents bowel symptom onset in patients on long-term proton pump inhibitors...|$|R

5|$|Mutations {{can involve}} large {{sections}} of a chromosome becoming duplicated (usually by genetic recombination), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome. Extra copies of genes are {{a major source of}} the raw material needed for new genes to evolve.

For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: <b>three</b> <b>for</b> colour vision and one for night vision; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene.|$|E
