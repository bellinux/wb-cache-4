5|$|The CIA hands Jodie over to Nathan, now {{executive}} director of the DPA, overseeing the DPA's newest condenser, code-named the Black Sun. He reveals that the CIA is willing to let Jodie go if she agrees to a final mission. Jodie and a CIA team led by Ryan destroy a facility housing a Chinese-developed condenser before it is used to attack the United States. Jodie then learns that Nathan built a miniature condenser to speak exclusively to his family, but without success. After showing Nathan that his refusal <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>go</b> is only making them suffer, Jodie tries to leave, only to be held in captivity by the CIA—the organisation has deemed her too dangerous to be freed. Jodie is subjected to the same fate as her mother. Nathan appears and informs Jodie that he's decided to shut down the containment field to the Black Sun, merging the two worlds together and making death meaningless. Too weak to free Jodie, Aiden contacts Ryan and Cole, leading them to her. After Nathan shuts down the containment field, the three chase after him {{into the heart of the}} Black Sun, with the intent of destroying it.|$|E

The Caisse d'Epargne riders dropped when the break extended to four minutes over the peloton, and Discovery retook the workload. The lead of the break extended more and more; essentially Discovery was content <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>go.</b> When the lead ballooned to eight minutes, it was calculated, given the flat course, the peloton could not make the gap up even if they wanted to. A bunched sprint for ninth place and the 17 green jersey points it afforded was still expected.|$|E

The English army under command of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester was of no real benefit to the Dutch rebellion. Philip II, the son of Charles V, was not prepared <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>go</b> easily, and war continued until 1648, when Spain under King Philip IV finally recognised {{the independence of the}} seven north-western provinces in the Peace of Münster.

When told by the Prince of Wales that the King was to be removed to Kew, but that she should move to Queens House or Windsor, she successfully insisted that she accompany her spouse to Kew. However, she and her daughters were taken to Kew separately from the King and lived secluded from him during his illness. They regularly visited him, but the visits tended to be uncomfortable, as he had a tendency to embrace them and refuse <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>go.</b>|$|E

His father celebrated his son's brave act by {{inviting}} {{his friends to}} a gathering and gave away seven horses and all the goods in his dry goods store. Luther became a school recruiter for Captain Pratt and periodically visited reservations. He demonstrated what the students had learned and persuaded parents {{to send their children}} to Carlisle by his appearance, language and skills; however, many children died from infectious diseases in boarding schools and parents were fearful <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>go.</b> Moreover, many parents were treated unfairly and had not been notified until after the children died and were buried. Unscrupulous Indian agents failed to mail letters from Carlisle to the parents, until the parents came into the agency for something. While many parents were proud of Luther, they were afraid to send their children away fearing they would never see them again.|$|E

25|$|After teaming {{together}} since 1985, The Rockers split up in December 1991 after backstage disputes. The {{exact nature of}} the dispute has not been confirmed by the WWF other {{than it was a}} monetary issue that lead to Jannetty quitting the WWF on behalf of both Rockers. According to Michaels's book, Jannetty had claimed that World Championship Wrestling were willing to give them a very high guaranteed contract but when Michaels inquired about it {{it turned out to be}} an exaggeration. Jannetty disputes this saying that Michaels was the driving force suggesting to quit the WWF, but had Jannetty do the phone call to ask for a release from their contract. When Vince McMahon actually agreed <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>go</b> Michaels appeared shocked according to him, and later went to McMahon unbeknownst to him to explain this was Jannetty's idea only and that he had no intention of leaving the WWF himself. After cooler heads prevailed it was decided that The Rockers should split with Michaels turning heel to feud with Jannetty. Jannetty was not happy about the team splitting, while Michaels could not wait to work as a singles wrestler.|$|E
25|$|Barrington {{was chosen}} to manage the {{forthcoming}} tour of Pakistan in the first season of the WSC, both sides losing players as a result. Phil Edmonds and Paul Downton were taken on the tour, Downton on Barrington's advice after playing only a few county games and he gave Edmonds was long practise sessions in the nets to improve his spin bowling. The team arrived {{in the wake of}} General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's military coup displacing Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the country {{was in a state of}} high tension and disorder. In the First Test 40,000 Bhutto supporters rioted at the ground and the teams took refuge in their dressing rooms as the army restored order. The TCCB gave Barrington permission to cancel the tour if he saw fit and realising this the players urged him <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>go</b> home for Christmas. In the Second Test England collapsed in the first innings to the leg-spinner Abdul Qadir (6/44), but Barrington bowled his own leg-spin at Brearley and Boycott for an hour before the second innings and their 185 opening stand saved the game. The Third Test was surrounded by controversy as Pakistan wanted brought in their WSC players Zaheer Abbas, Mushtaq Mohammad and Imran Khan to win a series victory in the last Test. This would have given them an edge over an England team without its WSC veterans. Several England players led by the vice-captain Geoff Boycott, Bob Willis and Derek Randall refused to play Pakistan with their Packer players and Barrington and Brearley tried to negotiate between the players, the TCCB and the Pakistani cricket authorities. Matters were made worst by Mike Brearley breaking his arm and returning to England, leaving the uncompromising Boycott as captain and Willis as vice-captain. Fortunately, the Pakistani players could only play by breaking their WSC contracts, which they refused to do, and the Test was drawn. Barrington was out of his depth in these political matters, even though Willis later admitted that his determination for the Test to be played regardless was the right course.|$|E

New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison subsequently learns about potential links to the assassination in New Orleans. Garrison and his team investigate several possible conspirators, including private pilot David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), but are forced <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>go</b> after their investigation is publicly rebuked by the federal government.

As such, the Director deploys the remaining Wardogs, led by the vicious Ramirez (Chris McKinney), to hunt Cash down and kill him; from this point on, the Director no longer communicates to Cash.|$|E

It was therefore decided {{that it would not be}} safe to land, but as the vessel sailed along the coast, numerous canoes came out, bringing boars' tusks for sale. Three boys who had been taken on a cruise of six weeks the year before, eagerly came on board, and thirty or forty more. All the parents were averse <b>to</b> <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> <b>go,</b> and only two ended by being brought away: Itole, a young gentleman of fourteen or so, slim and slight, with a waist like a wasp, owing to a cincture worn night and day, and his hair in ringlets, white with coral-lime; his friend a little older, a tall, neat-limbed fellow, not dark and with little of the negro in his features.|$|R

Very hang-dog, droopy shoulders, slouchy, very sad, inward-looking creatures." [...] He said that they were only allowed out [...] "at certain times of day that would be adjudicated to be the least likely time when DM [...] would run into them if he was on the property.

[...] This admonition was unnecessary though: Latour-Maubourg quickly placed his cavalry between the chasing Allied divisions and the fleeing French infantry, and aborting their pursuit the British and Portuguese instead drew up on the heights they had just won. Soult also moved up his final reserve—two strong Grenadier battalions—to cover the retreat, and although these suffered heavily from Allied artillery fire, they and the cavalry ensured there was little further fighting. [...] After some delay Beresford brought up three Portuguese brigades and drove the Grenadiers back, but by this time Soult had massed his artillery in a line against the Allies and Beresford did not further commit his forces.|$|E
500|$|A {{decade before}} {{ascending}} in the Gulf Cartel leadership rankings, Cárdenas Guillén avoided arrest by FBI and DEA agents in 1998, after they raided {{his home in}} Houston, Texas. The federal agents saw the drug lord leave, but they decided to pursue a search warrant than to chase him, given the activity in the neighborhood, the amount of cars at the parking lot near his house, {{and the lack of}} sufficient agents in the operative. Inside the domicile, the US authorities discovered [...] "cash, numerous vehicles, cocaine, marijuana, firearms and one 1996 Sea Doo Bombardier with expired Florida registration." [...] In 1998, the federal agents knew little about Cárdenas Guillén and the criminal organization he worked for. The FBI later closed the investigation in February 1999 due to the drug lord's fugitive status, his local indictments, and the lack of information available in the Houston jurisdiction. Ten months later on November 1999, the Cárdenas Guillén surname started to gain momentum when Antonio Ezequiel's brother Osiel and several of his gunmen stopped two US federal agents at gunpoint in the streets of Matamoros.
