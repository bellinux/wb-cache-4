However, some IAHA insiders claimed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> really led to his ousting.

Despite his contract stipulating that IAHA was to pay all his personal legal expenses, {{on top of his}} $100,000 annual salary, the Association refused initially to pay the legal bills. It was claimed that Brown created the legal defense fund on the advice of IAHA's own legal counsel.|$|E
500|$|Millett wrote {{several books}} on women's lives from a feminist perspective. For instance, in the book The Basement: Meditations on a Human Sacrifice (1979), {{completed}} over four years, she chronicled the torture and murder of Indianapolis teenager Sylvia Likens by Gertrude Baniszewski in 1965 that had preoccupied her for 14 years. With a feminist perspective, she explored {{the story of the}} defenseless girl and the dynamics of the individuals involved in her sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Biographer Roberta M. Hooks wrote, [...] "Quite apart from any feminist polemics, The Basement can stand alone as an intensely felt and movingly written study of the problems of cruelty and submission." [...] Millett said of the motivation of the perpetrator: [...] "It {{is the story of the}} suppression of women. Gertrude seems to have wanted to administer some terrible truthful justice to this girl: <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> it was to be a woman".|$|E

500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the war, county cricket resumed in 1946, during which year Seamer played two matches with little success. He did not appear in first-class cricket in 1947, but was named as one of three captains of Somerset in 1948. Jack Meyer had reluctantly captained the side in 1947, but stepped {{down at the end of}} the season: he was having problems with his sight, and required daily painkillers for lumbago. There was no obvious replacement for Meyer; like many counties Somerset would not consider having a professional captain, and finding an amateur with the time and money to lead the side was proving troublesome. So, with no single candidate suitable, the Somerset committee announced that the club would be captained first by Mitchell-Innes during his leave from the Sudan, then Seamer during his own leave. Once both of these had returned to their duties, George Woodhouse would take over. In his history of Somerset County Cricket Club, Peter Roebuck describes the situation as a [...] "remarkable state of affairs", while David Foot suggests that the true number of captains was closer to seven. During his time as captain, Seamer carried an old train board saying [...] "To Tonbridge" [...] in his cricket bag, claiming that it brought good luck to the team. In the eleven matches that Somerset played under his captaincy though, only one resulted in a victory. Seamer claimed that some of his best friends at the club were among the professionals, who he praised for their team spirit, despite the strained leadership changes. His friendship with the professionals was in contrast to the attitudes of both the club's committee, and its captain for the previous season. Meyer had been unpopular with the professionals due to his attitude to the game, and the manner in which he utilised them, while the club's committee felt that the professional players deserved little recognition when successful, claiming <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> they were paid for. Seamer's batting was no longer strong enough to support his inclusion in the team, and he played low in the middle order. He failed to reach double figures in any of his first seven innings that season, but recorded a half-century against Kent in his final match for Somerset, his first since 1936 in first-class cricket.|$|E

2500|$|Through [...] {{conversations with}} his father, David learned about {{this way of}} {{training}} that his father called [...] "parcours". He heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done {{in order to find}} the best way of doing things. He learned [...] that for his father, training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about. David realised <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> he had been searching for, and so he began training in the same way. After a time, he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training.|$|E
2500|$|In Gombe National Park in 1960, Jane Goodall {{observed}} a chimpanzee, David Greybeard, poking pieces of grass into a termite mound and then raising the grass to his mouth. After he left, Goodall approached the mound and repeated the behaviour {{because she was}} unsure what David was doing. She found that the termites bit onto the grass with their jaws. David had been using the grass {{as a tool to}} [...] "fish" [...] or [...] "dip" [...] for termites. Soon after this initial discovery of tool use, Goodall observed David and other chimpanzees picking up leafy twigs, stripping off the leaves, and using the stems to fish for insects. This modification of a leafy twig into a tool was a major discovery: previously, scientists thought that only humans made and used tools, and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> separated humans from other animals.|$|E
2500|$|Hoppus and {{his girlfriend}} at this time lived in a {{basement}} apartment, barely scraping together funds to pay rent. With money in savings, Hoppus {{went out and bought}} his first professional equipment: a new amp and bass cabinet. He came home {{and his girlfriend}} proceeded to argue with him, angry that he spent money on something they did not need. [...] "I just kept telling her <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> mattered to me, this was my life," [...] Hoppus recalled. She demanded he make a choice between the band and her, which resulted in Hoppus leaving the band shortly after formation. Shortly thereafter, DeLonge told Hoppus he had borrowed a four track recorder from a friend and was preparing to record a demo tape, which prompted Hoppus to break up with his girlfriend and return to the band. Flyswatter—a combination of original songs and punk covers—was recorded in Raynor's bedroom and landed the band their first shows. Three more demos were recorded over the course of 1993 and the band began performing its irreverent live show at local all-ages venue SOMA, which alerted local independent label Cargo Music. Cargo signed the band on a trial basis, and Hoppus was the only member to sign the contract, as DeLonge was at work at the time and Raynor was still a minor. During this time, Hoppus lived at home in San Diego at his mother's, where the band would prepare cassette demos and the entire family would fold cassette inserts. Raynor, whose parents moved to Reno, Nevada, stayed with Hoppus in summer 1994.|$|E

2500|$|Indirect discrimination, after {{a neutral}} {{practice}} puts {{a member of}} a group at a particular disadvantage, is not made out if there is an [...] "objective justification". In most cases, this will be a justification based on business necessity. The ECJ, mostly in cases concerning sex discrimination under TFEU art 157, has held that an employer must show a [...] "real need" [...] for the practice that has a disparate impact, and it must be [...] "unrelated" [...] to the protected characteristic. The justification should not involve [...] "generalisations" [...] rather than reasons specific to the workers in question, and budgetary considerations alone are not to be considered an [...] "aim". Many foundational judgments concerned employers who gave fewer benefits to part-time staff than full-time staff. Given the particular disadvantage this caused women it was hard to justify. In domestic equal pay claims based on gender, instead of [...] "objective justification", the old terminology still used is that there must be a [...] "genuine material factor", found in EA 2010 section 69. Despite different headings, the same underlying concepts are present as for objective justification, with the need to show a [...] "legitimate aim" [...] and that action is [...] "proportionate" [...] to such an aim. In Clay Cross (Quarry Services) Ltd v Fletcher Lord Denning MR held that an employer could not justify paying a young man a higher wage than an older lady (who in fact trained him) on the basis <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> the employer had to pay given the state of the job market. However, in Rainey v Greater Glasgow Health Board the House of Lords held that women NHS prosthetists who were paid 40% less than men prosthetists, who had become contracted through private practices, had no claim because it was agreed that such higher prices were necessary to attract their services. Thus, the [...] "objective justification" [...] was said to be an organisational necessity. In Enderby v Frenchay Health Authority the ECJ held that although a speech therapist being paid less than a male counterpart could not be justified only on the ground that this resulted from different collective agreements, if a disparity came from market forces, this was an objective justification. It has, however, been emphasised that the legislation's purpose is to achieve equal pay, and not fair wages. So in Strathclyde RC v Wallace the House of Lords held that women teachers who had to fill in for an absent male head master were not entitled to be paid the same during that time. This was a different job. It has also been asserted that collective agreements designed to incrementally make a transition to equal pay between jobs rated as equivalent cannot be justified, and can even result in liability for the union that concluded them. Unlike other protected characteristics, under EA 2010 section 13(2), direct age discrimination is open to justification on the same principles, on the basis that everyone will go through the ageing process. This has meant, primarily, that older workers can reach a compulsory retirement age set either by the workplace or the government, on the basis that it is a legitimate way of sharing work between generations.|$|E
