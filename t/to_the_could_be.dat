30|$|Direct answers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{question}} <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> obtained {{when the}} question was non-factoid. However, the words that <b>are</b> related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> question <b>could</b> <b>be</b> obtained. <b>The</b> suitable answers that include <b>the</b> relevant words <b>could</b> <b>be</b> also obtained as shown in Example E. However, words that frequently appear in many documents <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> distinguished from those that co-occur with content words in the question using mutual information. Thus, {{we think that the}} selection of these words using IDF will be able to be tried in the future.|$|R

25|$|As part of {{this state}} campaign, uses of words such as 'famine' and 'hunger' were banned because they implied {{government}} failure. Citizens who said deaths <b>were</b> due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> famine <b>could</b> <b>be</b> in serious trouble with the authorities.|$|R

50|$|Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have criticised {{the code}} of conduct and some NGOs like MSF refused to sign. Italian {{authorities}} feared that rather than saving lives, the NGO operations encouraged more people <b>to</b> try <b>the</b> very dangerous passage facilitated by human traffickers.

25|$|The {{practical}} {{amplifier circuit}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{basis for a}} moderate-power audio amplifier. It features a typical (though substantially simplified) design as found in modern amplifiers, with a class-AB push–pull output stage, and uses some overall negative feedback. Bipolar transistors are shown, but this design would also be realizable with FETs or valves.|$|R

This {{allows for a}} {{computation}} of the equilibrium equations at an element level, {{without the need for}} an assembly procedure. This fact is specially important in a GPU implementation, since each elemental contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equation <b>could</b> <b>be</b> computed separately and independently.|$|R
2500|$|It {{was taught}} in a Baraita that Rabbi Akiva {{said that one of}} three things that he liked about the Medes was that when they held counsel, they did so only in the field.

Sulfonation either {{before or after}} attachment of <b>the</b> silane <b>to</b> <b>the</b> support <b>could</b> <b>be</b> performed, each producing phases with different exchange capacities and selectivities.

5|$|In 1148, Pope Eugene III {{granted the}} abbey an {{exemption}} on paying tithe for their newly acquired land and livestock.

30|$|The holotype of N. nawei sp. nov. {{shows no}} signs of {{contraction}} or distortion because it was properly fixed. The paratypes show artefacts since the method of rapidly killing them was not followed properly. Some comments mainly about variations in the morphology of the copulatory apparatus (compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> holotype) <b>could</b> <b>be</b> helpful for comparison with other species that exhibit similar artefacts.|$|R
2500|$|On August 28, federal {{mediator}} Fox {{met with}} Ott, several large growers, and Odell. Odell agreed {{to reduce his}} demand for a wage increase to 25 cents an hour.

Odell later told the press he had made no such concession.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the positron-electron autocorrelation function of defect center in silicon. The positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) spectra taken on the as-grown and defected samples of silicon were studied.

50|$|A {{consequence}} of this first war was <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> chronic insubordination of Flanders. After the count’s surrender and imprisonment, it was left <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Flemish burghers <b>to</b> revolt against <b>the</b> French garrisons, and the French knights suffered a terrible defeat at Courtrai in July 1302. Thereafter the tide turned. But {{it was only in}} 1305 that a settlement satisfactory <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king <b>could</b> <b>be</b> reached.|$|R

2500|$|During the crisis, on 11 September President Nixon {{initiated}} a program <b>to</b> address <b>the</b> problem of [...] "air piracy", including the immediate {{launch of a}} group of 100 federal agents to begin serving as armed sky marshals on U.S. flights. Nixon's statement further indicated the U.S. departments of Defense and Transportation would determine whether X-ray devices then available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military <b>could</b> <b>be</b> moved into civilian service.|$|R
30|$|Since {{the number}} of {{detected}} decays inside the lesion is almost 20 times larger for TB-PET than for conventional PET, the amount of activity administered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patient <b>could</b> <b>be</b> highly reduced. Due <b>to</b> this reduction, <b>the</b> number of patients that can be scanned daily can be increased accordingly. A TB-PET system would allow <b>the</b> clinicians <b>to</b> scan all patients using a single 68 Ga generator.|$|R
50|$|Current {{efficiency}} {{is a measure}} of how effective ions are transported across the ion exchange membranes for a given applied current. Typically current efficiencies >80% are desirable in commercial stacks to minimize energy operating costs. Low current efficiencies indicate water splitting in the diluate or concentrate streams, shunt currents between the electrodes, or back-diffusion of ions from <b>the</b> concentrate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> diluate <b>could</b> <b>be</b> occurring.|$|R
