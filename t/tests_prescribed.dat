60|$|In the Catholic {{question}} I considered {{only one}} point: Was it, at the time, {{and in the}} circumstances, a measure which tended to promote the concord of the citizens? I have no difficulty in saying it was,--and as little in saying that the present concord of the citizens was worth buying, at a critical season, by granting a few capacities, which probably no one man now living {{is likely to be}} served or hurt by. When any man tells you and me, that, if these places were left in the discretion of a Protestant crown, and these memberships in the discretion of Protestant electors or patrons, we should have a Popish official system, and a Popish representation, capable of overturning the Establishment, he only insults our understandings. When any man tells this to Catholics, he insults their understandings, and he galls their feelings. It is not the question of the places and seats, it is the real hostile disposition and the pretended fears, that leave stings {{in the minds of the}} people. I really thought that in the total of the late circumstances, with regard to persons, to things, to principles, and to measures, was to be found a conjuncture favorable to the introduction and to the perpetuation of a general harmony, producing a general strength, which to that hour Ireland was never so happy as to enjoy. My sanguine hopes are blasted, and I must consign my feelings on that terrible disappointment to the same patience in which I have been obliged to bury the vexation I suffered on the defeat of the other great, just, and honorable causes in which I have had some share, and which have given more of dignity than of peace and advantage to a long, laborious life. Though, perhaps, a want of success might be urged as a reason for making me doubt of the justice of the part I have taken, yet, until I have other lights than one side of the debate has furnished me, I must see things, and feel them too, as I see and feel them. I think I can hardly overrate the malignity of the principles of Protestant ascendency, as they affect Ireland,--or of Indianism, as they affect these countries, and as they affect Asia,--or of Jacobinism, as they affect all Europe and the state of human society itself. The last is the greatest evil. But it readily combines with the others, and flows from them. Whatever breeds discontent at this time will produce that great master-mischief most infallibly. Whatever tends to persuade the people that the few, called by whatever name you please, religious or political, are of opinion that their interest is not compatible with that of the many, is a great point gained to Jacobinism. Whatever tends to irritate the talents of a country, which have at all times, and at these particularly, a mighty influence on the public mind, is of infinite service to that formidable cause. Unless where Heaven has mingled uncommon ingredients of virtue in the composition,--quos meliore luto finxit præcordia Titan,--talents naturally gravitate to Jacobinism. Whatever ill-humors are afloat in the state, they will be sure to discharge themselves in a mingled torrent in the Cloaca Maxima of Jacobinism. Therefore people ought well to look about them. First, the physicians are to take care that they do nothing to irritate this epidemical distemper. It is a foolish thing to have the better of the patient in a dispute. The complaint or its cause ought to be removed, and wise and lenient arts ought to precede the measures of vigor. They ought to be the ultima, not the prima, not the tota ratio of a wise government. God forbid, that, on a worthy occasion, authority should want the means of force, or the disposition to use it! But where a prudent and enlarged policy does not precede it, and attend it too, where the hearts of the better sort of people do not go with the hands of the soldiery, you may call your Constitution what you will, in effect it will consist of three parts, (orders, if you please,) cavalry, infantry, and artillery,--and of nothing else or better. I agree with you in your dislike of the discourses in Francis Street: but I like as little some of those in College Green. I am even less pleased with the temper that predominated in the latter, as better things might have been expected in the regular family mansion of public discretion than, in a new and hasty assembly of unexperienced men, congregated under circumstances of no small irritation.

The isolators are not bonded to the sub-and super-structure (elimination of the steel end-plates), hence their weight and cost are reduced. The experimental investigation is carried out on small-scale isolator prototypes reinforced by quadridirectional carbon fiber fabrics. The isolators are subjected to the following qualification <b>tests</b> <b>prescribed</b> by the Italian Code "Ordinanza 3274 " for steel reinforced isolators: 1) "Static assessment of the compression stiffness"; 2) "Static assessment of the shear modulus G"; 3) "Dynamic assessment of the dynamic shear modulus G din and of the damping coefficient ξ; 4) "Assessment of the Gdin-γ and ξ-γ diagrams by means of dynamic tests"; 5) "Assessment of creep characteristics"; 6) "Evaluation of the capacity of sustaining at least 10 cycles".

The {{current study}} was {{conducted}} on a sample of 302 participants, divided into two sub-samples: 150 boys and 152 girls, aged 10 and 11, to determine gender differences in morphological characteristics and motor skills, {{as well as their}} relations to the abovementioned space test for assessing agility. The battery of <b>tests</b> <b>prescribed</b> by the Committee for the Development of Sport of the Council of Europe was used. By applying a multivariate (MANOVA) analysis of variance for the two genders, differences in the morphological characteristics (F= 2. 544; P= 0. 006) and motor performance (F= 15. 451; P= 0. 000) were found. At the univariate level, the differences were manifested in volume and body mass, muscle strength of the knee extensors, wrist flexor muscle strength, static strength of the arms and shoulders, repetitive force of the upper body and tests for the assessment of agility, all in favor of the boys. The research findings also indicate that the relationship between morphological characteristics and the test for assessing agility indicate a statistically significant relation only {{in the case of the}} girls. In addition, the relationship between the motor skills on the test for the assessment of agility was established both in boys and in girls.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Juvenile {{idiopathic}} arthritis (JIA) is a {{term that}} encompasses all forms of arthritis that begin {{before the age of}} 16 years old, persist for more than 6 weeks and are of unknown cause. The ILAR criteria for JIA classification are {{based on the number of}} joints involved. The aim of our study was to compare clinical evaluation and ultrasonography (US) in the assessment of joint synovitis in children with suspected JIA. METHODS: We enrolled in our study all children who presented at our outpatient clinic of Paediatric Rheumatology with suspected JIA. All the children underwent a clinical examination for joint swelling (40 joints), a tender joint count (42 joints) and US examination (42 joints) on the same day. They all returned to the clinic after approximately 2 weeks with the results of the <b>tests</b> <b>prescribed</b> at the first visit and a diagnosis was formulated. RESULTS: Thirty-one children were enrolled. More synovitis was identified by US than by than clinical examination (42 joints vs. 27). Clinical examination classified as swollen 13 joints that did not result affected at US. Of the 94 painful joints, 24 were affected by synovitis at US.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Up to 50 % {{of women}} with {{untreated}} coeliac disease experience miscarriage or an unfavourable outcome of pregnancy. In most cases, after 6 - 12 months of a gluten free diet, no excess of unfavourable outcome of pregnancy is observed. The prevalence of undiagnosed coeliac disease among pregnant women is not known. AIM: To determine the prevalence of untreated coeliac disease among women attending the obstetrics-gynaecological department. METHODS: Endomysial antibodies, which are specific and sensitive for coeliac disease, were evaluated in all women attending the obstetrics-gynaecology department of a large city hospital over a 90 day period. RESULTS: Of 845 pregnant women screened, 12 were identified as having coeliac disease. Three had previously been diagnosed but were not following a gluten free diet. The remaining nine underwent a small intestinal biopsy, which confirmed the diagnosis. The outcome of pregnancy was unfavourable in seven of these 12 women. Six healthy babies were born with no problems after the women {{had been on a}} gluten free diet for one year. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 1 in 70 women was affected by coeliac disease, either not diagnosed (nine cases) or not treated (three cases). Their history of miscarriages, anaemia, low birth weight babies, and unfavourable outcome of pregnancy suggests that testing for coeliac disease {{should be included in the}} battery of <b>tests</b> <b>prescribed</b> for pregnant women.

A total of 4, 085 patients with AIH were identified between 2009 and 2013 with a female-to-male ratio of 6. 4. The age-adjusted prevalence rate was 4. 82 / 100, 000 persons and gender adjusted prevalence rates were 8. 35 in females and 1. 30 in males. The age-adjusted calculated incidence rate was 1. 07 / 100, 000 persons (gender-adjusted 1. 83 in females and 0. 31 in males).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Diagnosis {{in chronic}} {{diarrhea}} {{in the absence}} of a distinctive clinical pattern is often challenging, as biochemical <b>tests</b> <b>prescribed</b> at the first evaluation do not show enough sensitivity and specificity to tailor further investigation. Intestinal permeability to sugars is an accurate test for detecting intestinal damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of the lactulose/mannitol (L/M) test in patients with chronic diarrhea. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study to evaluate the diagnostic value of the L/M test in chronic diarrhea. The test was administered to 261 consecutive patients presenting with three or more bowel movements daily for at least 3 wk. Biochemical tests including complete blood cell count, acute phase reactive proteins, serum albumin and iron, and stool cultures for bacteria, ova, and parasites were assessed at the same time. Additional diagnostic investigations were directed by clinical features as well as first-line test results. RESULTS: Over 3 yr, 120 (46 %) of our patients were found to have an organic cause for chronic diarrhea, whereas in 141 (54 %) a functional condition was diagnosed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the L/M test and C-reactive protein were independent predictors for the final diagnosis of organic cause of chronic diarrhea, with odds ratios of 1. 5 (95 % CI = 1. 29 - 1. 78) and 5. 2 (95 % CI - 1. 90 - 14. 12), respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the adjusted model was 0. 82, with positive predictive value of 80. 4 % and negative predictive value of 77. 7 %.

40|$|Background: According to Rome criteria, chronic {{constipation}} (CC) includes functional constipation (FC) and {{irritable bowel syndrome}} with constipation (IBS-C). Some {{patients do}} not meet these criteria (No Rome Constipation, NRC). The aim {{of the study was}} is to evaluate the various clinical presentation and management of FC, IBS-C and NRC in Italy. Methods: During a 2 -month period, 52 Italian gastroenterologists recorded clinical data of FC, IBS-C and NRC patients, using Bristol scale, PAC-SYM and PAC-QoL questionnaires. In addition, gastroenterologists were also asked to record whether the patients were clinically assessed for CC for the first time or were in follow up. Diagnostic <b>tests</b> and <b>prescribed</b> therapies were also recorded. Results: Eight hundred seventy-eight consecutive CC patients (706 F) were enrolled (FC 62. 5 %, IBS-C 31. 3 %, NRC 6. 2 %). PAC-SYM and PAC-QoL scores were higher in IBS-C than in FC and NRC. 49. 5 % were at their first gastroenterological evaluation for CC. In 48. 5 % CC duration was longer than 10 years. A specialist consultation was requested in 31. 6 %, more frequently in IBS-C than in NRC. Digital rectal examination was performed in only 56. 4 %. Diagnostic <b>tests</b> were <b>prescribed</b> to 80. 0 %. Faecal calprotectin, thyroid tests, celiac serology, breath tests were more frequently suggested in IBS-C and anorectal manometry in FC. More than 90 % had at least one treatment suggested on chronic constipation, most frequently dietary changes, macrogol and fibers. Antispasmodics and psychotherapy were more frequently prescribed in IBS-C, prucalopride and pelvic floor rehabilitation in FC. Conclusions: Patients with IBS-C reported more severe symptoms and worse quality of life than FC and NRC.

However, in the ceramics coating, thermal stress caused during heating and cooling process in the furnace may lead to debonding due to the low toughness of ceramics. In order to improve the heat resistance of the thermally sprayed coating, {{it is essential to}} evaluate the debonding strength. Generally, heat resistance of thermal spray coating is evaluated by thermal shock <b>test</b> <b>prescribed</b> by JIS H 8304 although few research is available in terms of singular stress {{at the end of the}} interface for JIS specimen under thermal shock. This paper focuses on the intensity of the singular stress at the end of interface. Then, the most suitable conditions are discussed with varying the coating material and the coating thickness...|$|R
