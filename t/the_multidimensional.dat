Like other traditions, Lingbao rituals had a {{theatrical}} quality that involved accompanying music, dances, and chants. Lingbao Daoism also shared <b>the</b> <b>multidimensional</b> aspect of Daoist ritual, meaning that it was carried on at several different levels simultaneously. For example, while a ritual was being performed, the priest would repeat the ritual within himself through interior meditation.|$|E

25|$|The female population, {{especially}} in rural areas, dominantly represents {{the face of}} poverty in Morocco. There have been two major methods to measure poverty in Morocco, which include the 'classic approach' and a second approach that pertains more towards the capabilities approach. The 'classic approach' uses the poverty line to statistically determine the impoverished population. This approach quantifies the number of poor individuals and households but {{does not take into}} account how the impoverished population lacks basic needs such as housing, food, health and education. The second approach focuses on satisfying this lack of basic needs and emphasizes <b>the</b> <b>multidimensional</b> nature of poverty.|$|E
25|$|From {{mathematical}} {{point of}} view ligand docking represents a search for global minimum on <b>the</b> <b>multidimensional</b> surface describing the free energy of protein-ligand binding. With ligands having up to 15-20 degrees of freedom (freely rotatable bonds) and complex nature of energy surface, global optimum search represents generally unsolved scientific task. To tackle this computationally challenging problem Lead-Finder applies unique approach combining genetic algorithm search, local optimization procedures, and a smart exploitation of the knowledge generated during the search run. Rational combination of different optimization strategies makes Lead Finder efficient in terms of coarse sampling of ligand's phase space and refinement of promising solutions.|$|E

The definition upholds the centrality of intent, <b>the</b> <b>multidimensional</b> understanding of destroy, broadens the definition of group identity beyond that of the 1948 definition yet argues that a substantial part of a group has to be destroyed before it can be classified as genocide (dependent on relative group size).|$|E
