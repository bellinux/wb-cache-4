In two studies {{there were no}} differences in maximum amplitude between hydroxyapatite and acrylic or silicone spherical enucleation implants, thus indicating that the implant material itself may not have a bearing on implant movement as long as the muscles are attached directly or indirectly to the implant and the implant is not pegged.The motility of a nonintegrated artiﬁcial eye may be caused by at least two forces. (1) The rubbing force between the posterior surface of the artiﬁcial eye and the conjunctiva that covers the implant may cause the artiﬁcial eye to move. Because this force is likely to be approximately equal in all directions, it would cause comparable horizontal and vertical artiﬁcial eye amplitudes. (2) An artiﬁcial eye usually ﬁts snugly in the conjunctival space (possibly not in the superior fornix). Therefore, any movement of the conjunctival fornices will cause a similar movement of the artiﬁcial eye, whereas lack of movement of the fornices will restrict its motility.Imbrication of the rectus muscles over a nonintegrated implant traditionally was thought to impart movement to the implant and prosthesis.

Approximately 20 % of boys will die of dilated cardiomyopathy that is associated with cytoskeletal protein disarray, contractile dysfunction, and reduced energy production. However, the mechanisms for altered energy metabolism are not yet fully clarified. Calcium influx through the L-type Ca 2 + channel is critical for maintaining cardiac excitation and contraction. The L-type Ca 2 + channel also regulates mitochondrial function and metabolic activity via <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> of the auxiliary beta subunit through intermediate filament proteins. Here, we find that activation of the L-type Ca 2 + channel is unable to induce increases in mitochondrial membrane potential and metabolic activity in intact cardiac myocytes from the murine model of Duchenne {{muscular dystrophy}} (mdx) despite robust increases recorded in wt myocytes. Treatment of mdx mice with morpholino oligomers to induce exon skipping of dystrophin exon 23 (that results in functional dystrophin accumulation) or application of a peptide that resulted in block of voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) “rescued” mitochondrial membrane potential and metabolic activity in mdx myocytes. The mitochondrial VDAC coimmunoprecipitated with the L-type Ca 2 + channel. We conclude that the absence of dystrophin in the mdx ventricular myocyte leads to impaired functional communication between the L-type Ca 2 + channel and mitochondrial VDAC. This appears to contribute to metabolic inhibition. These findings provide new mechanistic and functional insight into cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy...|$|E

Here, the authors investigated the role of ICa-L in regulating mitochondrial function in αMHC 403 /+mice.

Repeated exposure to WBV {{has been shown to}} cause neurogenic adaption of the skeletal muscles and to facilitate muscular function improvement, as well as reduced levels of cortisol (Cardinale & Wakeling, 2005). Phonatory function, in terms of intensity, has been found to improve following WBV at around 10 - 15 Hz when compared to vibration below 10 Hz (Yokoyama and Hoshino, 1973). The current project investigated the use of WBV as a passive method of improving phonation (minimum/maximum fundamental frequency, maximum vocal intensity) and self-perception of vocal condition compared to traditional vocal function exercise (VFE). Cortisol was measured to provide a biological explanation of changes in the outcome measures. Methods: Forty-five females with healthy voices were randomly assigned to one treatment group: WBV only, VFE, or a combined treatment (WBV+VFE). The WBV group phonated /a/ on a vibrating platform (15 Hz, 2 mm amplitude). The VFE group performed vocal exercises without vibration. The WBV+VFE group performed vocal function exercises on the vibrating platform. All groups received a total of ten minutes of training. Results: The VFE group significantly increased their maximum fundamental frequency after the intervention (p<. 05), with the WBV group showing the same trend. There was no statistically significant change in vocal intensity or salivary cortisol after treatment across all groups. On the self-rating of vocal condition, the WBV group rated it easier to phonate in the low pitch range after treatment compared to the WBV+VFE group (p <. 05). Conclusions: Limited changes were observed across groups on the outcome measures.
