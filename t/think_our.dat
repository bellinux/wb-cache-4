[...] Days before the season opener, Lloyd Carr compared the daunting schedule to an expedition to Mount Everest. Carr noted, [...] "It's a little akin to climbing Mount Everest.

Liverpool played as we expected – they played quite aggressively. We didn't feel uncomfortable but we made a couple of mistakes." [...] Gazzaev rued the injuries his team suffered indicating {{there might have been a}} different outcome had certain players been fit.|$|E

I think there were certain things that happened behind the scenes that couldn't be helped. Our goal was to put a song out that people liked and we think we've done that".

500|$|The Seattle Sounders won the Open Cup in 2009, 2010, and 2011. They also {{reached the}} final in 2012 but were {{eliminated}} by a lower-level side early in 2013.

Seattle hosts most Open Cup home games at Tukwila's Starfire Sports stadium. The ground holds about 4,000, which is much smaller than their normal home stadium, CenturyLink Field. Coach Sigi Schmid was quoted as saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>our</b> guys thrive on the closeness of the crowd. It helps spur them on to good performances."

The Vitamin String Quartet musicians {{who took part}} in the recording included two violinists, a violist, a cellist and a conductor. The performance of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] featured The Late Show's Gospel Choir, consisting of five men and five women dressed in red. After filming, Jared Leto described the band's excitement about being asked to record for MTV Unplugged stating, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>our</b> generation, it was kind of a rite of passage, and if you were invited to do MTV Unplugged, it certainly was a pretty big deal.

500|$|In The Speaker, A.B.Walkley {{admired the}} play {{and was one of}} few to see it as the {{culmination}} of Wilde's dramatic career. He denied the term [...] "farce" [...] was derogatory, or even lacking in seriousness, and said [...] "It is of nonsense all compact, and better nonsense, I <b>think,</b> <b>our</b> stage has not seen." [...] H.G.Wells, in an unsigned review for the Pall Mall Gazette, called Earnest one of the freshest comedies of the year, saying [...] "More humorous dealing with theatrical conventions {{it would be difficult to}} imagine." [...] He also questioned whether people would fully see its message, [...] "...how Serious People will take this Trivial Comedy intended for their learning remains to be seen. No doubt seriously." [...] The play was so light-hearted that many reviewers compared it to comic opera rather than drama. W. H. Auden later called it [...] "a pure verbal opera", and The Times commented, [...] "The story is almost too preposterous to go without music." [...] Mary McCarthy, in Sights and Spectacles (1959), however, and despite thinking the play extremely funny, would call it [...] "a ferocious idyll"; [...] "depravity is the hero and the only character." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Yorktown, Washington's army {{returned}} to New York, while Rochambeau's remained in Virginia. [...] Washington, concerned that Congress [...] "may <b>think</b> <b>our</b> work too nearly closed", worked {{to make sure}} that the army would be prepared for a campaign in 1782. [...] Although British ship movements caused Washington some concerns during the winter of 1781–2, he was able to enjoy relative comfort in Philadelphia. [...] He {{returned to}} his headquarters in Newburgh, New York in March 1782, where he had to deal with greedy military supply contractors. [...] The execution of militia officer Joshua Huddy by Loyalists occasioned an exchange between Washington and Clinton, and led to the so-called [...] "Asgill Affair", after the officer selected to be executed in retaliation for Huddy's hanging. [...] Despite the onset of peace negotiations in the second half of 1782, Washington remained vigilant, treating with suspicion assertions on the part of General Clinton's replacement, Sir Guy Carleton, that he had suspended [...] "all hostilities". [...] To boost morale, Washington introduced the Badge of Military Merit, to be awarded for [...] "unusual gallantry" [...] or [...] "extraordinary fidelity and essential service". [...] The badge, a purple-colored cloth in the shape of a heart, is a precursor to the modern American Purple Heart.|$|E
500|$|Roddenberry {{realized}} {{early on}} that a series with the original crew from Star Trek was unlikely to be practical, nor {{did he want to}} recast the roles or have a [...] "retread" [...] crew– a series of different characters in very similar roles to the original series. He explained, [...] "I would hate to <b>think</b> <b>our</b> imagination is so slender that there aren't other possibilities to think about." [...] The first casting call was sent out on December 10, 1986. While some characters such as Geordi La Forge and Beverly Crusher remain recognizable from their descriptions in the initial casting call, others have clear differences; [...] "Julien Picard" [...] would lapse into a French accent when he became emotional, and Data was non-Caucasian. Macha Hernandez was a Latino security chief based on Jenette Goldstein's role in Aliens, while Deanna Troi was to appear [...] "foreign" [...] or more specifically of an Icelandic or Scandinavian nature. Leslie Crusher was listed as a fifteen-year-old girl with a photographic memory, although was quickly changed to a male teenager called Wesley. Justman argued for a female teenager but Roddenberry thought {{that there would be a}} greater number of storylines available if the character was male.|$|E

500|$|As Fear of Flying, Banquet Records {{described}} the band's second single as [...] "Quite danceable indie". The Guardians official website named them an indie-pop band, stating [...] "they made promising, if unremarkable, Franz Ferdinand-styled pop with cheeky chappy lyrics". In {{an interview with}} BBC London, they cited Talking Heads as a major influence. White Lies' darker sound has been primarily compared to Joy Division, Interpol and Editors, as well as Arcade Fire, The Killers, Echo & the Bunnymen, Tears for Fears and The Teardrop Explodes. McVeigh's singing voice {{has been compared to}} that of Ian Curtis and Julian Cope. When asked about the comparisons in an interview with ITN Music, McVeigh stated that [...] "We weren't alive during that period of music...we've never really been that into Joy Division, especially not the Editors...or even Interpol really", adding [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>our</b> music sounds a whole lot like those comparisons, I think we're a lot more euphoric and uplifting". As White Lies, the band have reiterated the influence of Talking Heads, both musically and in songwriting. As well as this, the band have stated that The Secret Machines are one of their main influences. In a commentary on a [...] "Track by Track" [...] interview on Spotify, one band member said that the band was influenced by The Cars, specifically how their guitar riffs on [...] "Be Your Man" [...] from the [...] "Big TV" [...] album was influenced by The Cars song [...] "Just What I Needed".|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} for his new television series Homeland, 24 executive producer Howard Gordon addressed {{the impact of the}} series, describing it as [...] "stunning - everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I <b>think</b> <b>our</b> awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So I guess you could call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E
