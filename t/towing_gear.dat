40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis is {{an introduction to the}} problematics of fish avoidance behavior in response to a trawl <b>gear</b> <b>towed</b> by one or two trawlers (motor boats). Avoidance or escape reactions are dependent on many factors and ecological conditions influencing animals´ behaviour therefore it is necessary to refer about fish sensory organs and perception. The content also deals with methods useful for studying fish behaviour in the wild. These are invasive and noninvasive technics and methods like acoustics, video cameras and <b>towed</b> <b>gears</b> (mainly trawls). All of them have become an important tool in recent surveys of marine environment as well as freshwater lakes and reservoires...|$|R
50|$|Besides the {{established}} trawling fleets, {{a significant number}} of fleets using lobster creels have developed. The better size and condition of lobsters caught by this method yield prices three to four times higher than animals netted by trawling. Creel fishing was found to have a reduced impact on the seafloor, require lower fuel consumption, and allow fishermen with smaller boats to participate in this high-value fishery. It has therefore been described as a reasonable alternative to demersal <b>towed</b> <b>gears,</b> and the allocation of additional fishing rights for this type of take has been suggested.|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{discipline of}} gear selectivity research {{has a long}} tradition that can be traced back hundreds of years. This note aims at giving a short review of central aspects of size selectivity analysis of data from experiments with <b>towed</b> fishing <b>gears.</b> It is thus not intended as a technical introduction to the analysis. More detailed descriptions can be found elsewhere in the literature. SINGLE HAUL ANALY SES Experiments with towed can be conducted by different methods. The most commonly used are covered codend and paired gear techniques. These are characterized by collecting fish in two compartments one of which is assumed virtually non-selective. The purpose of the non-selective compartment is to collect information about the local abundance of fish that entered the combined gear. With the appearance of more complicated gear with multiple selective devices (e. g. grids or panels) the experimental gears have also developed into more complex designs. The most important advancement in the analysis of single hauls was done by Millar in 1992, when he developed the SELECT method. The method is very general and covers not only all types of size selectivity experiments with <b>towed</b> <b>gears</b> but also experiments with passive gears, i. e. hooks, set-net...|$|R

25|$|The vessel {{struck a}} reef off Bass Point, Shell harbour, late on Wednesday night, and was badly holed. As she {{appeared}} likely to founder quickly, she was abandoned, {{and the crew}} of 11 rowed to Kiama, five miles away. Returning to the scene early yesterday morning, they were astonished {{to find that the}} Incoming tide had refloated the vessel, which was rapidly drifting out to sea. The crew, in the ship's dinghy, reached Kiama at 2 o'clock yesterday morning, and Captain James Reid, the master, reported the matter to the police. The men rested until shortly before daybreak, and then set out in a launch owned by Mr. C. Stead to retrieve their personal belongings. As they drew near the spot where the Koraaga had gone ashore they found she had disappeared, and it was feared that she had already foundered. Within a few minutes, however, the vessel was seen about {{a mile and a half}} offshore, drifting southward under the influence of a strong current and a stiff north-easterly breeze. Her trawling flags were still flying, and she gave the appearance of being under control. So much so that, several hours later, two Interstate steamers passed without noticing anything amiss. By noon the trawler, now low in the water, was several miles out to sea. Members of the crew overtook the Koraaga early in the morning and went on board. They found that the engine room was flooded, and the vessel was being kept afloat by watertight compartments. There were then two possibilities, either that she would founder when the weight of water broke down the bulkheads, or that she would go ashore on Gerringong Beach. Word was sent to Sydney, and Cam and Sons, the owners, dispatched the trawler Charlie Cam, equipped with <b>towing</b> <b>gear,</b> to the scene. It was hoped to reach her before she went ashore or sank, and that she would have sufficient buoyancy to enable her to be towed to Sydney. She disappeared, however, before the Charlie Cam had reached the scene, and the salvage trawler was recalled. Worn out by his all day vigil beside the sinking vessel, Captain Reid returned to Kiama at 4 o'clock. He reported that the trawler had heeled over and foundered an hour before, about five miles east of Black Head, Gerringong, 9 miles from Kiama. Captain Reid was on board until just before the foundering. He said that the Koraaga sank in two minutes. The trawling flags and signals were still flying when she disappeared.|$|E
500|$|The carrier was {{initially}} sold for breaking up as scrap metal for A$1.7million, although the sale fell through in June 1984. She was sold again in February 1985 to the China United Shipbuilding Company for A$1.4million, {{with the intention}} that she be towed to China and broken up for scrap. Prior to the ship's departure for China, the RAN stripped Melbourne of all electronic equipment and weapons, and welded her rudders into a fixed position {{so that she could}} not be reactivated. However, her steam catapult, arresting equipment and mirror landing system were not removed. At this time, few western experts expected that the Chinese Government would attempt to develop aircraft carriers in the future. The carrier departed Sydney on 27 April 1985, heading for Guangzhou, China, under the tow of tug De Ping. The journey was delayed when the towing line began to part, requiring the carrier and tug to shelter in Moreton Bay, Queensland, on 30 April. The <b>towing</b> <b>gear</b> broke a day later, requiring a second tug to secure the carrier while repairs were made to De Ping. Three days later, Melbourne ran aground while still in Moreton Bay.

40|$|Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole and Norway lobster are 7 main {{target species}} of the {{demersal}} mixed fisheries in the North Sea, Skagerrak and Eastern Channel. Gadoids and Norway lobsters are mainly taken in the nor-thern North Sea by <b>towed</b> <b>gears</b> except beam trawls while the flatfish fisheries are conducted in the southern North Sea mainly using beam trawls. Recently, the central North Sea appears less fished by demersal <b>gears.</b> <b>Towed</b> nets including seines and beam trawls equipped with meshes of more than 100 mm resp. more than 80 mm were identified as the main gears effecting the depleted cod and reduced plaice stocks. The saithe sector, using towed nets with meshes of more than 110 mm, longlines, gill nets and others, appears to affect the 7 species to a lesser extend. These results support the interim effort limitations by gear types, vessel and month as enforced by the European Commission since 2003. TAC regulations alone are considered inefficient to sustainably harvest stocks by mixed fisheries. A fleet-effort management method is developed estimating the fleets’ effects based on the sum of partial exploitation rates of the species in mixed fisheries weighted by {{the ratio of the}} precautionary reference Bpa and the actual SSB size as ecological quality objective.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} seabed {{pressure}} of <b>towed</b> fishing <b>gears</b> and models the physical impact (area {{and depth of}} seabed penetration) from trip-based information of vessel size, gear type, and catch. Traditionally fishing pressures are calculated top-down by making use of large-scale statistics such as logbook data. Here, we take a different approach starting from the gear itself (design and dimensions) to estimate the physical interactions with the seabed {{at the level of}} the individual fishing operation. We defined 14 distinct <b>towed</b> <b>gear</b> groups in European waters (eight otter trawl groups, three beam trawl groups, two demersal seine groups, and one dredge group), for which we established gear “footprints”. The footprint of a gear is defined as the relative contribution from individual larger gear components, such as trawl doors, sweeps, and groundgear, to the total area and severity of the gear's impact. An industry-based survey covering 13 countries provided the basis for estimating the relative impact-area contributions from individual gear components, whereas sediment penetration was estimated based on a literature review. For each gear group, a vessel size–gear size relationship was estimated to enable the prediction of gear footprint area and sediment penetration from vessel size. Application of these relationships with average vessel sizes and towing speeds provided hourly swept-area estimates by métier. Scottish seining has the largest overall gear footprint of ~ 1. 6 km 2 h - 1 of which 0. 08 km 2 has an impact at the subsurface level (sediment penetration = 2 cm). Beam trawling for flatfish ranks low when comparing overall footprint size/hour but ranks substantially higher when comparing only impact at the subsurface level (0. 19 km 2 h - 1). These results have substantial implications for the definition, estimation, and monitoring of fishing pressure indicators, which are discussed in the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management...|$|R
