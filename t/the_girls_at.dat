5|$|Ariadne persuades Litsas, {{a former}} Second World War {{resistance}} fighter {{and friend of}} her late father, to help them by telling him about the involvement in the plot of former Nazi, Von Richter. Trying to find M and Colonel Sun, Bond is nearly captured by the Russians, but is saved by Litsas. Finally, Bond finds Sun's headquarters, but is knocked out by one of Sun's men; Bond learns that Von Richter will use a mortar to destroy the conference venue and that Bond will be tortured by Sun, before his inevitable demise. Sun tortures him brutally, until one of <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>at</b> the house is ordered by Sun to caress Bond fondly. In the process she cuts one of Bond's hands free and provides him with a knife. She tells Sun that Bond is dead: when examined Bond stabs Sun. He then frees other captives who help Bond stop Von Richter. However Sun survives the stab wound and kills several of the other escapees. Bond tracks down Sun and kills him in the confrontation. The Soviets thank Bond for saving their conference, offering him a medal for his work, which he politely turns down.|$|E
5|$|As a joke {{mirroring}} Cartman's, one of <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>at</b> school queefs on Butters' face, {{causing him}} to run screaming and crying {{out of the school}} building. The other boys are shocked and their fathers, outraged, go to the Colorado General Assembly and demand a law banning queefing, much to the anger of the town's women. Meanwhile, the Queef Sisters appear on Regis and Kelly to promote their book Eat, Pray, Queef, and Terrance and Philip's show gets canceled due to the rising popularity of the Queef Sisters. Terrance and Philip attempt to kill the Queef Sisters, but the plan backfires when they end up becoming attracted to them after the Queef Sisters mention that Terrence and Phillip are the sisters' idols. They pair off into couples and travel the Canadian Wine Country together. Meanwhile, after Stan's mother Sharon queefs, she and Stan's sister, Shelley, start laughing at the dinner table, causing Stan and his father Randy to leave.|$|E
5|$|The boys of South Park Elementary School are anxiously {{awaiting}} the night's episode of Terrance and Phillip, {{which ended in}} a cliffhanger last season, while <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>at</b> the school express disgust over the show and the boys' obsession with fart jokes. Cartman retaliates by farting in a little girl's face, which causes all the boys to laugh. After school, the boys gather in Cartman's house to watch the episode. To their horror, it is then revealed that, as an April Fools Day joke, the channel is airing a new show called the Queef Sisters, about Canadian sisters Katherine (voiced by Trey Parker) and Katie Queef (voiced by Matt Stone). They {{are very similar to}} Terrance and Phillip, but instead of fart jokes, they make queef jokes. The show starts a queefing movement across the country, and men everywhere get upset and disgusted by the queefs, although the women do not understand what the problem is. Though the women of South Park argue that there is no difference between queefing and farting, the men are revolted by queefs, while still finding their own fart jokes amusing.|$|E

500|$|During {{the last}} year of her stay at the Academy, Emily became {{friendly}} with Leonard Humphrey, its popular new young principal. After finishing her final term at the Academy on August 10, 1847, Dickinson began attending Mary Lyon's Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (which later became Mount Holyoke College) in South Hadley, about ten miles (16km) from Amherst. She was at the seminary for only ten months. Although she liked <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>at</b> Holyoke, Dickinson made no lasting friendships there. The explanations for her brief stay at Holyoke differ considerably: either she was in poor health, her father wanted to have her at home, she rebelled against the evangelical fervor present at the school, she disliked the discipline-minded teachers, or she was simply homesick. Whatever the specific reason for leaving Holyoke, her brother Austin appeared on March 25, 1848, to [...] "bring [...] home at all events". Back in Amherst, Dickinson occupied her time with household activities. She took up baking for the family and enjoyed attending local events and activities in the budding college town.|$|E

500|$|Early press {{coverage}} was [...] "mixed", generally {{a combination of}} [...] "embarrassment and puzzlement". The historical novelist and poet Maurice Hewlett published {{a series of articles}} in the literary journal John O' London's Weekly, in which he concluded: [...] "And knowing children, and knowing that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has legs, I decide that the Miss Carpenters have pulled one of them." [...] The Sydney newspaper Truth on 5 January 1921 expressed a similar view; [...] "For the true explanation of these fairy photographs what is wanted is not a knowledge of occult phenomena but a knowledge of children." [...] Some public figures were more sympathetic. Margaret McMillan, the educational and social reformer, wrote: [...] "How wonderful that to these dear children such a wonderful gift has been vouchsafed." [...] The novelist Henry De Vere Stacpoole decided to take the fairy photographs and <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>at</b> face value. In a letter to Gardner he wrote: [...] "Look at Alice's [...] face. Look at Iris's [...] face. There is an extraordinary thing called Truth which has 10million faces and forms– it is God's currency and the cleverest coiner or forger can't imitate it." ...|$|E

500|$|The Dumas's {{business}} and those like it were criticized {{by a number}} of people who sought to reform the red light district. Reverend William Biederwolf condemned Butte as [...] "the lowest sinkhole of vice in the west," [...] and that he saw [...] "enough legitimate vice in Butte to damn the souls of every young man and young woman in it." [...] Biederwolf held revival services for residents which attracted [...] "rounders, gamblers and habitués of the red light district". However, the local business benefited and even depended on the support of the sex workers at the Dumas and other establishments like it. The prostitutes would buy their dresses at local clothiers, frequent the city's dry cleaners and would patronize Chinese herbalists, looking for birth control potions and venereal disease remedies. To ensure that their operations were unhampered, <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>at</b> the Dumas would pay the city's police and governance five dollar [...] "fines". Instead of the closing or relocating the red light district, the mayor and police of Butte ordered that the women wear longer skirts and high-necked blouses and that they [...] "refrain from any indecent exposures." [...] After these ordinances were put in place, the Butte Miner reported that [...] "nothing was seen in the district except long dresses and long faces. What the women say about the matter is not fit for publication." [...] By 1910 the people were petitioning Mayor Charles Nevin to shut down the district; with the district contributing two thousand dollars to the city's coffers every month, the efforts eventually died.|$|E

As the chorus plays for the first time, the cameras follow the girls as they respectively walk around their surroundings, bar Sandford who remains in the tree and White who does not move from her spot. In the verse following, King is sitting by the road side with her bike and Wiseman is seen sitting on the rocks near the water's edge. Then as the chorus breaks for the second time the girls are seen dancing a choreographed routine on a sandy beach. Each is wearing a flowing maxi dress (see image alongside). The interspliced scenes of Sandford walking through trees gained a mention in The Daily Mail. [...] "Sandford is seen wearing a cropped white top and white shorts, Frankie walks casually through a field in the video, seemingly unaware of the attention her astonishing six pack is receiving." [...] The song's bridge mainly focusses on footage of <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>at</b> a beach party dancing to the DJ, while the final run of the chorus sees the camera rotate around the girls as they dance on the beach.
