Conspiracy theorists immediately began pointing out possible links to the Cooper case, but authorities responded that they {{have no reason to believe}} that any such link exists. Woodinville officials later announced that the most likely motive for the crime was burglary.|$|E

2500|$|President Hosni Mubarak {{promised in}} a {{televised}} address that terrorists would not destabilize Egypt or divide Christians and Muslims. He said the attack [...] "carries evidence of the involvement of foreign fingers" [...] and vowed to pursue <b>the</b> <b>perpetrators.</b> Many doubt that <b>the</b> <b>perpetrators</b> will be pursued, citing the Mubarak regime's preference for handling violence against the country’s Christian minority through a reconciliation process between <b>the</b> <b>perpetrators</b> and <b>the</b> victims, rather than prosecution of <b>the</b> <b>perpetrators.</b>|$|R

5|$|Keith {{meets with}} Principal Clemmons and finds Veronica in the closet. Veronica talks to Mr. Wu {{about one of}} his students, Peter, who had {{feelings}} for Mr. Wu. However, Mr. Wu is not gay. That night, Veronica has a dream about Peter, who “asks” her why he would even {{want to go to}} a baseball stadium. Veronica talks to Beaver, who was pushed into a wall by Cervando, a PCHer who died in the bus crash.

Keith tells Veronica that <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> was probably targeting Dick and Beaver. Veronica has another, more frightening dream.|$|E
5|$|King County police, finally {{armed with}} a {{detailed}} description of their suspect as well as his car, posted fliers throughout the Seattle area. A composite sketch was printed in regional newspapers and broadcast on local television stations. Elizabeth Kloepfer, Ann Rule, a DES employee, and a UW psychology professor all recognized the profile, the sketch, and the car, and reported Bundy as a possible suspect; but detectives—who were receiving up to 200 tips per day—thought it unlikely that a clean-cut law student with no adult criminal record could be <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator.</b>|$|E

5|$|Later, {{during his}} college tour, Chapman {{mentioned}} that a television audience member {{had written to}} the Pythons to complain about them having a gay member, adding that the Bible said any man who lies with a man should be taken out and stoned.

Both Sherlock and Tomiczek remained a constant in Chapman's life. In the mid-1980s, having resettled in Britain, the three moved to Maidstone, Kent.|$|E

5|$|After {{a dispute}} over stolen goods turns violent, Sobotka's son Ziggy is charged {{with the murder of}} one of the Greek's underlings.

However, the Greek learns about this through his mole inside the FBI and has Sobotka killed. The {{investigation}} ends with the fourteen homicides solved but <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> already dead. Several drug dealers and mid-level smuggling figures tied to the Greek are arrested, but he and his second-in-command escape uncharged and unidentified. The Major is pleased that Sobotka was arrested; the case is seen as a success by the commanding officers, but is viewed as a failure by the detail.|$|E

5|$|Later, Millennium Group {{offender}} profilers Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) {{investigate the}} disappearance of a bus full of schoolchildren. They believe the driver was also a victim, and not responsible; they meet with the local sheriff, John Cayce (Steven Rankin), who has dredged the bus from a lake. It is empty, but inside, Black experiences the same vision as Prine. He also finds paint transfer on the exterior, indicating <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> was driving a white van. A false positive results as police apprehend storm chasers in a different van, who warn that a violent tornado is approaching.|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus {{observed}} all due formalities {{towards the}} emperor, {{but in practice}} ruled as an independent monarch. In 266, the king launched a second invasion of Persia but had to abandon the campaign and head north to Bithynia to repel the attacks of Germanic riders besieging the city of Heraclea Pontica. He was assassinated in 267 during or immediately after the Anatolian campaign, together with Hairan. The identities of <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> or the instigator are unknown and many stories, accusations and speculations exist in ancient sources. He was succeeded by his son Vaballathus under the regency of his widow Zenobia, who used the power established by Odaenathus to forge the Palmyrene Empire in 270.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, 1913, Frank {{was indicted}} {{on a charge}} of murder and the case opened at Fulton County Superior Court on July 28. The {{prosecution}} relied heavily on the testimony of Conley, who described himself as an accomplice to the murder, and who the defense at the trial argued was in fact <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> of the murder. A guilty verdict was announced on August 25. Frank and his lawyers made a series of unsuccessful appeals; their final appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States failed in April 1915. Considering arguments from both sides as well as evidence not available at trial, Governor John M. Slaton commuted Frank's sentence from capital punishment to life imprisonment.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the main}} topics of debate after 's rampage became the way police dealt with him, {{especially}} whether the first two responding officers were, under the circumstances, supposed to immediately engage and neutralize <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator,</b> and whether the decision {{to wait for the}} arrival of the tactical unit was sound. The debate became more vocal after a cook, who managed to escape the rampage, claimed that she heard a slow series of single shots coming from the restaurant after the police had retreated. Another witness, who escaped unharmed, refuted this version of events, saying that shots were fired only during the initial ten minutes leading up to the point of police entry, with no shots heard thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Retaliatory punishments, or Qisas, are practised: for instance, an eye can be surgically removed at {{the insistence}} of a victim who lost his own eye.

Saudi officials and religious figures have criticized this trend and said that the practise of diyya has become corrupted.|$|E
5|$|Duane Roger Morrison (July 23, 1953 – September 27, 2006) was {{eventually}} identified as <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> of the incident. He was unemployed {{at the time}} of the hostage crisis, and had no known connection to Platte Canyon High School or any of the hostages. Initial reports of the gunman described him as a bearded 35-year-old man with a camouflage backpack and a black hooded sweatshirt. Morrison had been imprisoned in 1973 for larceny and possession of marijuana, and was arrested on a separate occasion for obstructing police in Littleton, Colorado. Police announced that a suicide letter written by Morrison to a family member was being analyzed by the FBI. Morrison's family gave the letter to police, who then submitted the document to the FBI Behavioral Unit in Quantico, Virginia. In the 14-page letter, Morrison claimed that he was mentally and physically abused by his father as a child, and had suicidal thoughts since he was 21 years old.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Alcohol use is {{to one of}} {{the most}} of risk factors for {{intimate}} partner violence. The aim of this study was to check the difference of demographic characteristics and type of violence between of <b>the</b> <b>perpetrators</b> with a history of alcohol abuse (A) versus <b>the</b> <b>perpetrators</b> without a history of alcohol abuse (N). Data were obtained from the survey conducted in the office of the Association for Violence Prevention in the city of Lublin, Poland. 400 perpetrators and their victims (400 subjects) were examined. To collect information from victims a specially designed questionnaire was used (VQ). Besides, another questionnaire (PQ) and The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was used to measure alcohol use in <b>the</b> <b>perpetrators.</b> About 76 % of <b>the</b> <b>perpetrators</b> scored 8 and above (AUDIT). 84. 8 % of <b>the</b> <b>perpetrators</b> with a history of alcohol abuse (A) versus 9. 2 % of <b>the</b> <b>perpetrators</b> without a history of alcohol abuse (N) committed acts of violence after alcohol consumption. The A-perpetrators were more likely to be younger, have lower education and break law, and less likely to have permanent jobs than <b>the</b> N- <b>perpetrators.</b> <b>The</b> significant difference in the type of violence was found: the A-perpetrators were more likely to commit physical violence (78. 2 %) than the N-perpetrators (33. 2 %) and the N-perpetrators were more likely to commit sexual violence (32. 2 %) than A-perpetrators (9. 14 %). We would like to conclude that despite similarities among perpetrators, they are not a homogenous group so different therapeutic approach should be considered...|$|R
