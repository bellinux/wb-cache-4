25|$|On 26 April a {{remote-controlled}} earth mover began {{clearing the}} rock underground. On {{the morning of}} 27 April at 7:22 a.m., the corpse {{of one of the}} miners was found in the shaft. At around 8 p.m., the corpse was retrieved and was identified as Larry Paul Knight, 44, of Launceston. He was the driver of the <b>telehandler.</b>|$|E
25|$|Later one rescuer found {{a direct}} {{route to the}} trapped miners, across the rubble in the side tunnel, {{and was able to}} get close enough to the basket of the <b>telehandler</b> to shake Russell's hand. This was where a {{remote-controlled}} loader had got {{to the back of the}} teleloader, but this route was deemed unsafe for rescuing them. Webb and Russell themselves did not want the rescuers to attempt to reach them through the rubble, because to do so would require them to cut through the wire on the side of the cage, which was under considerable pressure from the rock above. The two men were afraid that cutting the cage would cause it to collapse.|$|E
2500|$|Rescue workers did {{not proceed}} further {{through the rubble}} past {{the back end of}} the <b>telehandler</b> because it was unsafe, instead {{choosing}} to blast a new tunnel across from the main decline to the side tunnel, aiming to come {{out in front of the}} <b>telehandler.</b> On 29 April they began blasting a new tunnel, detonating at least six large explosive charges to form the tunnel. The blasts dislodged rock inside the cage of the <b>telehandler,</b> which Webb and Russell attempted to clear, although as the blasts came closer, rock was dislodged faster than they could clear it. Russell recorded the date and time of each blast on his clothing, so that if they died as a result of the blasting, the rescuers would know that they had been alive prior to a particular blast. Both Webb and Russell also wrote letters to their families on their clothing. The two men sang [...] "The Gambler" [...] by Kenny Rogers (the only song they both knew) in order to keep up their spirits, as they waited for successive blasts to occur in the tunnel. At about 5.45PM on 30 April two rescuers, Pat Ball the underground manager and Steve Saltmarsh, mine foreman, breached safety protocols by entering the 925 level, to the rockfall and yelled out. Webb and Russell began yelling [...] "We're in here!" [...] and this was how the rescuers found out they were alive.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the huge}} {{rectangular}} shape, large spear forks, or squeeze grips are mounted to heavy lifting machinery, such as large fork lifts, tractors equipped with front end loaders, <b>telehandlers,</b> hay squeezes or wheel loaders, to lift these bales.|$|R
50|$|Welded body {{hydraulic}} cylinders dominate the mobile hydraulic equipment market such as construction equipment (excavators, bulldozers, and road graders) and {{material handling equipment}} (forklift trucks, <b>telehandlers,</b> and lift-gates).

50|$|Traditional towed {{artillery}} {{can still be}} found in units where complexity and weight are liabilities: e.g. airmobile, amphibious and other light units. In such units, where organic transport is usually limited, any available transport can double as artillery tractors in order to reposition guns when needed. For example, engineer vehicles of a different primary purpose such as the U.S. Marines' Light Capacity Rough Terrain Forklift (LCRTF), a versatile <b>telehandler</b> forklift capable of towing gear from either end.|$|E
50|$|These loaders are {{a popular}} {{addition}} to tractors from 50 to 200 hp. Its current 'drive-in' form was originally designed and developed in 1958 by a Swedish company named Ålö when they launched their Quicke loader. Tractor loaders {{were developed to}} perform a multitude of farming tasks, and are popular due to their relatively low cost (compared to <b>Telehandler)</b> and high versatility. Tractor loaders can be fitted with many attachments such as hydraulic grabs and spikes to assist with bale and silage handling, forks for pallet work, and buckets for more general farm activities.|$|E
50|$|A {{telescopic}} handler, {{also called}} a <b>telehandler,</b> teleporter, or boom lift, is a machine {{widely used in}} agriculture and industry. It is somewhat like a forklift but has a , making it more a crane than a forklift, with the increased versatility of a single telescopic or articulating boom that can extend forwards and upwards from the vehicle. On {{the end of the}} boom the operator can fit one of several attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, muck grab, or winch. Telehandlers are sometimes called cherry pickers in North America, as that name can refer to any truck or heavy equipment that has such a boom.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, {{construction}} {{equipment such as}} loaders and <b>telehandlers</b> have been converted into shunting vehicles. These vehicles can still be used for their original purpose (shovelling or forklifting) in the yard whilst not being used to move rollingstock. The vehicles are fitted with in-cab train brake controls so that the driver may operate the braking system on the train.|$|R
50|$|Weidemann GmbH is a {{multinational}} agricultural machinery {{company based in}} Diemelsee-Flechtdorf {{in the district of}} Waldeck-Frankenberg in Hesse, Germany. It produces Hoftracs, wheel loaders, telescopic wheel loaders and <b>telehandlers,</b> which are preferably used on farmland for feeding, scattering, fertilising, loading and stacking. The company has sites in Diemelsee-Flechtdorf and Korbach, and is part of the Wacker Neuson group.|$|R
50|$|<b>Telehandlers</b> were {{pioneered by}} the Matbro company at Horley in Surrey, England, UK, which {{developed}} {{them from their}} articulated cross country forestry forklifts. At first they had a centrally mounted boom on the front section, with the driver's cab on the rear section, as in the Teleram 40, but the rigid chassis design with a rear-mounted boom and cab to the side has become more popular.|$|R
50|$|Later one rescuer found {{a direct}} {{route to the}} trapped miners, across the rubble in the side tunnel, {{and was able to}} get close enough to the basket of the <b>telehandler</b> to shake Russell's hand. This was where a {{remote-controlled}} loader had got {{to the back of the}} teleloader, but this route was deemed unsafe for rescuing them. Webb and Russell themselves did not want the rescuers to attempt to reach them through the rubble, because to do so would require them to cut through the wire on the side of the cage, which was under considerable pressure from the rock above. The two men were afraid that cutting the cage would cause it to collapse.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of the <b>telehandler</b> is also its biggest limitation: as the boom extends or raises while bearing a load, it acts as a lever and causes the vehicle to become increasingly unstable, despite counterweights in the rear. This means that the lifting capacity quickly decreases as the working radius (distance between {{the front of the}} wheels and the centre of the load) increases. When used as a loader the single boom (rather than twin arms) is very highly loaded and even with careful design is a weakness. A vehicle with a 5,000 lb (2.2ton) capacity with the boom retracted may be able to safely lift as little as 400 lb (225 kg) with it fully extended at a low boom angle. The same machine with a 5,000 lb lift capacity with the boom retracted may be able to support as much as 10,000 lb (5ton) with the boom raised to 70°. The operator is equipped with a load chart which helps him determine whether a given task is possible, taking into account weight, boom angle and height. Failing this, most telehandlers now utilize a computer which uses sensors to monitor the vehicle, and will warn the operator and/or cut off further control input if the limits of the vehicle are exceeded, the latter being a legal requirement in Europe controlled by EN15000. Machines can also be equipped with front stabilizers which extend the lifting capability of the equipment while stationary, as well machines with are fully stabilised with rotary joint between upper and lower frames, which can be called mobile cranes although they can typically still use a bucket, and are also often referred to as 'Roto' machines. They are a hybrid between a <b>Telehandler</b> and small crane.|$|E

50|$|In {{industry}} {{the most}} common attachment for a tele-handler is pallet forks and {{the most common}} application is to move loads to and from places unreachable for a conventional forklift.

The latter application would otherwise require a crane, which is not always practical or time-efficient.|$|R
50|$|In {{agriculture}} {{the most}} common attachment for a tele-handler is a bucket or bucket grab, again {{the most common}} application is to move loads to and from places unreachable for a 'conventional machine' {{which in this case}} is a wheeled loader or backhoe loadal. For example, <b>telehandlers</b> have the ability to reach directly into a high-sided trailer or hopper. The latter application would otherwise require a loading ramp, conveyor, or similar.|$|R
