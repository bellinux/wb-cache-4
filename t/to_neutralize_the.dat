50|$|During {{military}} operations, {{the role}} of field artillery is to provide support to other arms in combat or to attack targets, particularly in depth. Broadly, these effects fall into two categories, either <b>to</b> suppress or <b>neutralize</b> <b>the</b> enemy, or <b>to</b> cause casualties, damage, and destruction. This is mostly achieved by delivering high-explosive munitions to suppress, or inflict casualties on the enemy from casing fragments and other debris and blast, or by destroying enemy positions, equipment, and vehicles.

5|$|Most historians {{share the}} view that the militants {{escalated}} the conflict toward violence on the basis of false information transmitted by duplicitous individuals or groups attempting <b>to</b> <b>neutralize</b> <b>the</b> nationalist influence. Members of VVS and Jiny involved in the initial attacks have stated that their organizations were obliged to attack after the signal to take action was transmitted to them by a group that was later discovered to have secret ties to the national police. Researchers have documented reports of nationalists whose member organizations joined the conflict upon commands issued by the police, British nationals, and French settlers living in Madagascar. Despite the role of the militants in leading the uprising, the colonial authorities immediately held MDRM responsible for the movement and responded by targeting the party's members and supporters.|$|E
5|$|The Order of the Illuminati was an Enlightenment-age {{secret society}} founded by {{university}} professor Adam Weishaupt on 1 May 1776, in Upper Bavaria, Germany.

In 1785, the order was infiltrated, broken up and suppressed by the government agents of Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria, in his preemptive campaign <b>to</b> <b>neutralize</b> <b>the</b> threat of secret societies ever becoming hotbeds of conspiracies to overthrow the Bavarian monarchy and its state religion, Roman Catholicism.

5|$|Following the French {{surrender}} on 22 June, the French fleet {{was to be}} disarmed under German and Italian supervision, {{under the}} terms of the Armistice. The British high command, however, was concerned that the French ships would be seized by the Axis powers and placed in service. The Axis navies would then outnumber the British Royal Navy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill therefore ordered Vice Admiral James Somerville, the commander of Force H, <b>to</b> <b>neutralize</b> <b>the</b> French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir. He was instructed to order the French vessels to join the British with the Free French, to move them to French possessions like Martinique where they would be outside the reach of the Axis powers, to move them to the USA where they would be interned, to scuttle themselves, or be sunk. On 3 July, Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum. After 10 hours of discussions and the French rejection of any part of the ultimatum, the British ships opened fire.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of his career Rodman was known for his defensive hustle, which was later accompanied by his rebounding prowess. In Detroit, he was mainly played as a small forward, and his usual assignment was <b>to</b> <b>neutralize</b> <b>the</b> opponent's best player; Rodman was so versatile that he could guard centers, forwards, or guards equally well and won two NBA Defensive Player of the Year Awards. From 1991 on, he established himself {{as one of the best}} rebounders of all time, averaging at least 15 rebounds per game in six of the next seven years. Playing power forward as member of the Spurs and the Bulls, he had a historical outburst in the 1996 NBA Finals: he twice snared 11 offensive rebounds, equalling an all-time NBA record. In addition, he had a career-high 34-rebound game on March 4, 1992. Rodman's rebounding prowess with Detroit and San Antonio was also aided by his decreased attention to defensive positioning and helping teammates on defense. Daly said Rodman was selfish about rebounding, but deemed him a hard worker and coachable. Rodman's defensive intensity returned while with Chicago.|$|E
