5|$|Fish {{brains are}} divided into several regions. At the front are the {{olfactory}} lobes, a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the nostrils via the two olfactory nerves. The olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed <b>telencephalon,</b> the structural equivalent to the cerebrum in higher vertebrates. In fish the <b>telencephalon</b> is concerned mostly with olfaction. Together these structures form the forebrain.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the fourth}} week the cephalic part bends sharply forward in a cephalic flexure. This flexed part becomes the {{forebrain}} (prosencephalon); the adjoining curving part becomes the midbrain (mesencephalon) and the part caudal to the flexure becomes the hindbrain (rhombencephalon). In the fifth week of developmement five brain vesicles have formed. The forebrain separates into two vesicles an anterior <b>telencephalon</b> and a posterior diencephalon. The <b>telencephalon</b> {{gives rise to the}} cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures. The diencephalon gives rise to the thalamus and hypothalamus. The hindbrain also splits into two areas – the metencephalon and the mylencephalon. The metencephalon gives rise to the cerebellum and pons. The myelencephalon gives rise to the medulla oblongata. Also during the fifth week, the brain divides into repeating segments called neuromeres. These are known as rhombomeres seen in the hindbrain.|$|E
5|$|TBR1 is {{also used}} in {{immunohistochemical}} techniques in neurological research. It {{has been used to}} identify layer VI developing cortical neurons as well as the prethalamic eminence, pallium, and dorsal forebrain. The presence of TBR1 in stem cells responding to <b>telencephalon</b> injury implicates the normal function of these cells in this region of the brain.|$|E
5|$|Neuroanatomists usually {{divide the}} {{vertebrate}} brain into six main regions: the <b>telencephalon</b> (cerebral hemispheres), diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus), mesencephalon (midbrain), cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata. Each {{of these areas}} has a complex internal structure. Some parts, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex, consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space. Other parts, such as the thalamus and hypothalamus, consist of clusters of many small nuclei. Thousands of distinguishable areas can be identified within the vertebrate brain based on fine distinctions of neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity.|$|E
5|$|The first {{vertebrates}} appeared over 500million {{years ago}} (Mya), during the Cambrian period, {{and may have}} resembled the modern hagfish in form. Sharks appeared about 450Mya, amphibians about 400Mya, reptiles about 350Mya, and mammals about 200Mya. Each species has an equally long evolutionary history, but the brains of modern hagfishes, lampreys, sharks, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals show a gradient of size and complexity that roughly follows the evolutionary sequence. All of these brains contain {{the same set of}} basic anatomical components, but many are rudimentary in the hagfish, whereas in mammals the foremost part (the <b>telencephalon)</b> is greatly elaborated and expanded.|$|E
5|$|For vertebrates, {{the early}} stages of neural {{development}} are similar across all species. As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate, the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the <b>telencephalon</b> (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.|$|E
25|$|The insular cortex is {{considered}} a separate lobe of the <b>telencephalon</b> by some authorities. Other sources see the insula {{as a part of}} the temporal lobe. It is also sometimes grouped with limbic structures deep in the brain into a limbic lobe. As a paralimbic cortex, the insular cortex {{is considered}} to be a relatively old structure.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{the brain}} shows the limited size and {{elongated}} shape of that of modern cold-blooded reptiles. However, in 1973, McGowan, while studying the natural endocast of a well-preserved specimen, {{pointed out that}} the <b>telencephalon</b> was not very small. The visual lobes were large, as could be expected from the eye size. The olfactory lobes were, though not especially large, well-differentiated; the same was true of the cerebellum.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, scientists argued that the birds had hyper-developed basal ganglia, with tiny mammalian-like <b>telencephalon</b> structures. Modern studies have refuted this view. The basal ganglia only occupy {{a small part of the}} avian brain. Instead, it seems that birds use a different part of their brain, the medio-rostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale (see also nidopallium), as the seat of their intelligence, and the brain-to-body size ratio of psittacines (parrots) and corvines (birds of the crow family) is actually comparable to that of higher primates.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosencephalon}} divides {{into the}} <b>telencephalon,</b> which forms the cortex {{of the developed}} brain, and the diencephalon. The ventricles contained within the <b>telencephalon</b> become the lateral ventricles, and the ventricles within the diencephalon become the third ventricle.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{peripheral}} nervous system, Ngns {{are involved in}} the determination of all cranial and spinal sensory progenitors. Proneural genes such as mash1, ngn1 and ngn2 are mainly expressed in most progenitors of spinal cord, and are also co-express in the dorsal <b>telencephalon.</b> Together these groups of bHLH factors promote the generation of all cerebral cortex progenitors. [...] Mash1 is the only gene expressed in the ventral <b>telencephalon.</b> However, in the ventral and dorsal ends of the neural tube a different type of proneural genes is expressed, such as ngn3 and ‘’math1’’.|$|E

50|$|In the {{developing}} vertebrate embryo, the neural tube is subdivided into four unseparated sections which then develop further into distinct {{regions of the}} central nervous system; these are the prosencephalon (forebrain), the mesencephalon (midbrain) the rhombencephalon (hindbrain) and the spinal cord. The prosencephalon develops further into the <b>telencephalon</b> and the diencephalon. The dorsal <b>telencephalon</b> {{gives rise to the}} pallium (cerebral cortex in mammals and reptiles) and the ventral <b>telencephalon</b> generates the basal ganglia. The diencephalon develops into the thalamus and hypothalamus, including the optic vesicles (future retina). The dorsal <b>telencephalon</b> then forms two lateral telencephalic vesicles, separated by the midline, which develop into the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Birds and fish have a dorsal <b>telencephalon,</b> like all vertebrates, but it is generally unlayered and therefore not considered a cerebral cortex. Only a layered cytoarchitecture can be considered a cortex.|$|E

50|$|The {{cerebrum}} is a {{large part}} of the brain containing the cerebral cortex (of the two cerebral hemispheres), as well as several subcortical structures, including the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and olfactory bulb.

50|$|These {{boundaries}} {{have great}} influence over {{other regions of}} the brain: the placement of the ZLI not only affects the size of adjacent regions but also the size of the <b>telencephalon.</b> A posterior shift in the ZLI allows more cells to be allocated to the <b>telencephalon.</b> The same is true for other developmental boundaries in the brain and throughout the body: shifts in boundaries responsible for allocating a certain amount of tissue to a certain function result in drastic changes in the adult structure. These boundaries are of crucial importance for proper differentiation.|$|E
