25|$|Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STI), {{also referred}} to as sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and venereal diseases (VD), are infections that are commonly spread by sex, especially vaginal intercourse, anal sex or oral sex. Most STIs initially do not cause symptoms. This results in a greater risk of passing the disease on to others. Symptoms and signs of disease may include vaginal discharge, penile discharge, ulcers on or around the genitals, and pelvic pain. STIs acquired before or during birth may result in poor outcomes for the baby. Some STIs may cause problems with <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> pregnant.|$|E

25|$|In the {{era when}} long {{distance}} trips took several days, sleeping accommodations were {{an essential part}} of transportation. (On land, the lodging involved was often part of the infrastructure: the inn or ryokan, which did not move, sheltered travellers. People also slept on ships at sea.) Today, most airlines, inter-city trains and coaches offer reclining seats and many provide pillows and blankets for overnight travellers. Better sleeping arrangements are commonly offered for a premium fare and include sleeping cars on overnight trains, larger private cabins on ships and aircraft seats that convert into beds. Budget-conscious tourists sometimes plan their trips using overnight train or bus journeys in lieu of paying for a hotel. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> additional sleep {{on the way to work}} is attractive to many commuters using public transport.|$|E

2500|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{the games}} at nearly zero cost, Wolfire Games {{estimate}} that 25% of the traceable downloads {{for the first}} Bundle have come from software piracy by links provided in some forums that bypass the payment screen to access the games; Wolfire further surmises additional piracy occurred through BitTorrent-type peer-to-peer sharing services. Rosen noted they purposely removed much of the DRM associated with games to appeal {{to those who would}} otherwise engage in software piracy, through both having the games ship without DRM and by having only limited copy protection on their website. Rosen also stated that for about ten users that emailed Wolfire about being unable to pay for the software, he personally donated on their behalf. Rosen comments that there may be legitimate reasons for those who appear to be pirating the game, including the inability to use the payment methods provided or that they had made a single large donation for multiple copies. Rosen also considered that there are players that would simply forward the download links to [...] "take pleasure in spreading the pirated links to their friends or anonymous buddies for fun". Wolfire Games did take action to stop predatory sites, such as the closely named [...] "wollfire.com", from selling illegal copies of the bundle.|$|E
