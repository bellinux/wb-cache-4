5|$|The 100th Congress {{formed a}} joint {{committee}} (Congressional Committees Investigating <b>The</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Affair)</b> and held hearings in mid-1987. Transcripts were published as: Iran-Contra Investigation: Joint Hearings Before the Senate Select Committee on Secret Military Assistance to Iran and the Nicaraguan Opposition and the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran (U.S. GPO 1987–88). A closed Executive Session heard classified testimony from North and Poindexter; this transcript {{was published in}} a redacted format. The joint committee's final report was Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Affair</b> With Supplemental, Minority, and Additional Views (U.S. GPO November 17, 1987). The records of the committee are at the National Archives, but many are still non-public.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{undercover}} {{collaboration with}} Ronald Reagan on his Contra war in Nicaragua (including <b>the</b> infamous <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>affair),</b> which had planes flying arms {{as well as}} drugs, relations between the United States and the Panama regime worsened in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Except for {{his three}} years as a Times special-projects editor in the 1980s, most of Rosenbaum's Times career was spent in the Times' Washington Bureau. Rosenbaum covered the 1970s Senate Watergate hearings, <b>the</b> 1980s <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Affair,</b> <b>the</b> {{restructuring}} of Medicare and Social Security, and various budget and tax debates between Congress and the White House.|$|R
5|$|Testimony {{was also}} heard before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence {{and can be}} found in the Congressional Record for those bodies. The Senate Intelligence Committee {{produced}} two reports: Preliminary Inquiry into the Sale of Arms to Iran and Possible Diversion of Funds to the Nicaraguan Resistance (February 2, 1987) and Were Relevant Documents Withheld from the Congressional Committees Investigating <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Affair?</b> (June 1989).|$|E
5|$|In 1986, <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair</b> {{became a}} problem for the {{administration}} stemming from the use of proceeds from covert arms sales to Iran during the Iran–Iraq War to fund the Contra rebels fighting against the government in Nicaragua, which had been specifically outlawed by an act of Congress. The affair became a political scandal in the United States during the 1980s. The International Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed by the United States, ruled that the United States had violated international law and breached treaties in Nicaragua in various ways.|$|E
5|$|Since Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, {{substantial}} debate has occurred among scholars, historians, {{and the general}} public surrounding his legacy. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies, foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War, and a restoration of American pride and morale. Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States, after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during the Iran hostage crisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook {{for the future of the}} United States during the 1980 election. Critics contend that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits, a wider gap in wealth, and an increase in homelessness and that <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair</b> lowered American credibility.|$|E
50|$|By 1982 Contra {{forces had}} begun {{carrying}} out assassinations {{of members of}} the Nicaraguan government and by 1983 the Contras had launched a major offensive and the CIA was helping them to plant mines in Nicaragua's harbors to prevent foreign weapons shipments from arriving. <b>The</b> 1987 <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>affair</b> placed <b>the</b> Reagan Administration again at the center of secret support for the Contras.|$|R
5000|$|From 1981 to 1984, Olson {{served as}} an Assistant Attorney General (Office of Legal Counsel) in the Reagan administration. While serving in the Reagan administration, Olson was legal counsel to President Reagan during <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>affair's</b> {{investigation}} phase.Olson was also the assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel when then President Ronald Reagan ordered the Administrator of the EPA to withhold the documents {{on the ground that}} they contained [...] "enforcement sensitive information." [...] This led to an investigation by the House Judiciary Committee that later produced a report suggesting Olson had given false and misleading testimony before a House subcommittee during the investigation. The Judiciary Committee forwarded a copy of the report to the Attorney General requesting the appointment of an independent counsel investigation.|$|R
50|$|Jamshid Hashemi (also spelled Hashimi; 25 April 1936 - 26 August 2013) was an Iranian-born trader in {{arms and}} other {{commodities}} convicted of {{fraud in the}} UK in 1999. Hashemi had a 9-year relationship with the UK's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), beginning soon after his arrival in the UK in 1984. Hashemi and his brother Cyrus Hashemi {{played a role in}} the 1980 October Surprise affair (Jamshid later testified to the House October Surprise Task Force in 1992) and in <b>the</b> mid-1980s <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>affair.</b>|$|R
5|$|Several {{investigations}} ensued, including by the U.S. Congress and the three-person, Reagan-appointed Tower Commission. Neither {{found any}} evidence that President Reagan himself knew {{of the extent of}} the multiple programs. Ultimately the sale of weapons to Iran was not deemed a criminal offense but charges were brought against five individuals for their support of the Contras. Those charges, however, were later dropped because the administration refused to declassify certain documents. The indicted conspirators faced various lesser charges instead. In the end, fourteen administration officials were indicted, including then-Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Eleven convictions resulted, some of which were vacated on appeal. The rest of those indicted or convicted were all pardoned {{in the final days of}} the presidency of George H.W. Bush, who had been Vice President at the time of the affair. <b>The</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Affair</b> and the ensuing deception to protect senior administration officials including President Reagan has been cast as an example of post-truth politics.|$|E
5|$|The White House Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, grew {{frustrated}} with this regimen, which created friction {{between him and}} the First Lady. This escalated with the revelation of <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair,</b> an administration scandal, in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president. She thought he should resign, and expressed this to her husband, although he did not share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Reagan refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings. Regan became so angry with Reagan that he hung up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation. According to the recollections of ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded—and eventually received—Regan's resignation. Vice President George H. W. Bush is also reported to have suggested to Reagan to have Regan fired.|$|E
25|$|Reagan's Invasion of Grenada and {{bombing of}} Libya were {{popular in the}} U.S, though his backing of the Contras rebels was mired in the {{controversy}} over <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair</b> that revealed Reagan's poor management style.|$|E
50|$|According to {{a report}} in Time, Ghorbanifar's links with the CIA led to {{internal}} disputes, with the counter-terrorism division supporting him and Middle East officers attempting to discredit him. Ghorbanifar's anger at being labelled a liar may have led him to urge Iranian contacts to leak <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> story. <b>The</b> <b>affair</b> first became public in a Lebanese newspaper, apparently leaked by Mehdi Hashemi.|$|R
5000|$|The {{commercials}} were so memorable that HBO's news parody series Not Necessarily the News {{created a}} parody television commercial featuring {{a caricature of}} Oliver North (from <b>the</b> infamous <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>affair),</b> known as [...] "Crazy Ollie", selling used weapons at bargain prices. [...] An early Eddies commercial parody appeared on NBC's Saturday Night Live on January 22, 1977 in the Dan Aykroyd creation, [...] "Crazy Ernie." [...] Carroll and the commercials became significantly cultural during the 1980s, with the commercials sometimes appearing {{in the background of}} contemporary motion pictures. An example is the frightening first sight of a television receiver with a typical Jerry Carroll commercial on screen by Daryl Hannah's mermaid character in Ron Howard's 1984 comedy Splash.|$|R
25|$|Along with {{bombings and}} hijackings, Islamic terrorists have made {{extensive}} use of highly publicised kidnappings and executions, often circulating videos of the acts for use as propaganda. A frequent form of execution by these groups is decapitation, another is shooting. In the 1980s, a series of abductions of American citizens by Hezbollah during the Lebanese Civil War resulted in <b>the</b> 1986 <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair.</b> During <b>the</b> chaos of the Iraq War, more than 200 kidnappings foreign hostages (for various reasons and by various groups, including purely criminal) gained great international notoriety, even as the great majority (thousands) of victims were Iraqis. In 2007, the kidnapping of Alan Johnston by Army of Islam resulted in the British government meeting a Hamas member for the first time.|$|R
25|$|Gates was {{nominated}} {{to become the}} Director of Central Intelligence (head of the CIA) in early 1987. He withdrew his name after it became clear the Senate would reject the nomination due to controversy {{about his role in}} <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>affair.</b>|$|E

25|$|From {{an early}} stage, the rebels {{received}} financial and military {{support from the}} United States government, and their military significance decisively depended on it. After US support was banned by Congress, the Reagan administration covertly continued it. These covert activities culminated in <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair.</b>|$|E
50|$|Despite {{undercover}} {{collaboration with}} US president Ronald Reagan on his Contra war in Nicaragua (including <b>the</b> infamous <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Affair),</b> to deliver arms and drugs by airplane, {{relations between the}} United States and Panama worsened in the 1980s. In response to a domestic political crisis and {{an attack on the}} US embassy, the US froze economic and military aid to Panama in the summer of 1987. Tensions sharpened in February 1988 when Noriega was indicted in US courts for drug-trafficking. In April 1988, Reagan invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, freezing Panamanian Government assets in US banks, withholding fees for using the canal, and prohibiting payments by US agencies, firms, and individuals to the Noriega regime. The country went into turmoil.|$|R

50|$|Reagan's {{foreign policy}} stance was resolutely anti-communist; its plan of action, {{known as the}} Reagan Doctrine, sought to roll back the global {{influence}} of the Soviet Union {{in an attempt to}} end the Cold War. Under this doctrine, the administration initiated a massive buildup of the military, promoted new technologies such as missile defense systems, and, in 1983, undertook an invasion of Grenada, the first major overseas action by U.S. troops {{since the end of the}} Vietnam War. It also controversially granted aid to paramilitary forces seeking to overthrow leftist governments, particularly in war-torn Central America and Afghanistan. During Reagan's second term, he sought closer relations with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, and the two leaders signed the INF Treaty, a major arms control agreement. The Reagan administration engaged in covert arms sales to Iran in order to fund the Contra rebels in Nicaragua that were fighting to overthrow their socialist government. <b>The</b> resulting <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>affair</b> resulted in <b>the</b> conviction or resignation of several administration officials.|$|R
25|$|As part of <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair,</b> Israel and Argentina {{collaborated with}} the United States to send arms to Iran to assist in arming Nicaraguan contras. Transporte Aéreo Rioplatense, which was {{revealed}} to be operated by high-ranking officials in the Argentine Air Force, transported military equipment from Israel to Iran, {{in support of the}} latter during its war with Iraq.|$|E
25|$|His {{tenure as}} Secretary of Defense {{is the third}} longest in U.S. history, and spanned {{the final years of}} the Cold War. He is also known for his key role in the administration's Strategic Defense Initiative and for being indicted in <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair.</b> He was awarded both the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1987 and an honorary British knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E
25|$|In 1987 Moyers {{produced}} and hosted a scathing documentary, The Secret Government: The Constitution in Crisis, covering the infringement on the limitations on {{government and the}} executive branch provided by the Constitution. It considered U.S. foreign policy and militarism historically and recently, centering on <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair.</b> It was harshly rebuked by conservatives and continuing into the 1990s was used by Republicans {{as a reason to}} threaten the funding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and PBS.|$|E
