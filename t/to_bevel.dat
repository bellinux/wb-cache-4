6000|$|... § II. In {{speaking}} of the arch-line and arch masonry, we considered the arch to be cut straight through the wall; so that, if half built, it would have the appearance at a, Fig. LXIX. But in the chapter on Form of Apertures, {{we found that the}} side of the arch, or jamb of the aperture, might often require to be bevelled, so as to give the section b, Fig. LXIX. It is easily conceivable that when two ranges of voussoirs were used, one over another, {{it would be easier to}} leave those beneath, of a smaller diameter, than <b>to</b> <b>bevel</b> them to accurate junction with those outside. Whether influenced by this facility, or by decorative instinct, the early northern builders often substitute for the bevel the third condition, c, of Fig. LXIX.; so that, of the three forms in that figure, a belongs principally to the south, c to the north, and b indifferently to both.|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{physicians}} have {{no means of}} correctly estimating the needle tip location during percutaneous needle insertion. A model of needle-tissue interaction that predicts the needle tip location would assist physicians in pre-operative planning and hence improve needle targeting accuracy. This study is aimed to investigate the interactions of bevel-tipped needles and soft tissue in situ, using agarose gel as a soft-tissue simulant. An experimental setup is designed to record the needle-gel interaction forces and torques during needle insertion. Gel rupture during needle insertion is observed using a Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope and recorded in time series and three-dimensional images (Figure). Experimental results show the possibility of observing in situ gel rupture during needle insertion and relating them to the needle-gel interaction forces and torques. Moreover, it is seen that the maximum force along the insertion axis, |Fz max|, is proportional <b>to</b> <b>bevel</b> angle and inversely proportional to insertion speed. The maximum resultant torque, ||Tr max||, {{is found to be}} inversely proportional <b>to</b> <b>bevel</b> angle and proportional to insertion speed. However, the influence of the increase in insertion speed in |Fz max| and ||Tr max|| diminishes as insertion speed increases. These results concur with observations noted in gel rupture images...|$|E

In particular, the well known Willis equation has been modified to maintain its validity for bevel gears. The modified Willis equation was then embodied in new power ratio expressions.

40|$|Detailed {{studies of}} gear transmissions, such as NVH (Noise Vibration and Harshness) or {{durability}} analyses, require an accurate {{description of the}} contact forces, acting on meshing gear teeth. In order to properly model the contact force between two bodies, an accurate prediction of the contact locations and corresponding penetrations is required, before contact loads can be calculated. This paper proposes a numerically efficient and accurate contact model to calculate the contact locations and penetrations between mating gear flanks by making use of the ease-off concept. The proposed approach exploits the fact that mating gear flanks {{are designed to be}} close-to-conjugate and can account for possible micro-modifications and relative motion between the meshing gear flanks. Furthermore, this paper proposes an extension to the ease-off based contact modeling which enables accounting for misalignments without the need to recalculate the ease-off topography for each new misaligned configuration. In a preprocessing step to the actual contact detection algorithm, the surface of roll angles and ease-off topography for a given gear pair under a given kinematic configuration are calculated, starting from a cloud-of-point representation of the different gears. The use of a cloud-of-point representation, combined with the knowledge of the surface normal vectors, allows for the analysis of different types of gears, without the need of a detailed knowledge of the manufacturing process. Therefore, the created algorithm can account for different gear geometries, ranging from cylindrical gears <b>to</b> <b>bevel</b> and hypoid gears. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. At the FZG (Gear Research Centre, Munich, Germany) a {{research}} project was carried out to analyze {{the influence of the}} hypoid offset on the load capacity of bevel gears by systematic theoretical and experimental investigations. For the experimental investigations two types of bevel gears were designed, one for the pitting tests and one for the tooth root tests. The results of the tooth root tests showed as expected an increasing load capacity with higher offsets. In contrast the pitting tests showed an increasing, but after reaching a maximum, a decreasing load capacity with higher offsets. Regarding the test results a new calculation method was developed that is based on a loaded tooth contact analysis (LTCA). The method is able to consider the local stresses on the flank and in the tooth root. The local strength values are derived out of the standard ISO 6336 for the calculation of helical gears. For bending the local geometry of the tooth root is considered to adopt the strength values of helical gears <b>to</b> <b>bevel</b> and hypoid gears. As a result the local safety factors might be calculated along the face width of pinion and wheel. For pitting the local sliding conditions are taken into account in order to appraise the local lubrication conditions as well as the risk of crack initiations due to shear stresses and higher contact temperatures. The recalculation of the test showed for both types of failure a good correlation between the test results and the calculated values...|$|E

40|$|Planar {{refractive}} index profiles with rapid variations, formed in glass, are measured with interferometry.

This new approach avoids the necessity of filtering, in order to reduce noise, in the direction perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>bevel,</b> which would otherwise smooth out the rapid index changes. The method is assessed using a model {{refractive index}} profile that contains an index gradient of 0. 24 μm− 1 and is then applied practically to measure the refractive index profile of electrically poled BK 7 glass.
