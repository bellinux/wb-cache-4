5|$|Beer is {{measured}} and assessed by bitterness, by strength and by colour. The perceived bitterness {{is measured}} by the International Bitterness Units scale (IBU), defined in co-operation between the American Society of Brewing Chemists and the European Brewery Convention. The international scale was a development of the European Bitterness Units scale, often abbreviated as EBU, and <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> values should be identical.|$|E
5|$|Because of <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> of the {{campaign}} and {{the timing of the}} murder, speculation mounted that Sharp had been killed by an Anti-Relief partisan. For some time, rumors traveled that Darby was implicated in his death. Sharp's political rival, John J. Crittenden, tried to blunt such accusations by personally introducing a resolution condemning the murder and offering a $3000 reward for the capture of the assassin. The trustees of the city of Frankfort added a reward of $1000, and an additional $2000 reward was raised from private sources. In the 1825 session of the General Assembly, a measure to form Sharp County from Muhlenberg County died on the floor due to the tumultuous politics of the session.|$|E
5|$|Cucurbitacin is a plant steroid {{present in}} wild Cucurbita {{and in each}} member of the family Cucurbitaceae. Poisonous to mammals, it is found in {{quantities}} sufficient to discourage herbivores. It makes wild Cucurbita and most ornamental gourds, with the exception of an occasional C.fraterna and C.sororia, bitter to taste. Ingesting too much cucurbitacin can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea and even collapse. This bitterness is especially prevalent in wild Cucurbita; in parts of Mexico the flesh of the fruits is rubbed on a woman's breast to wean children. While the process of domestication has largely removed <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> from cultivated varieties, there are occasional reports of cucurbitacin causing illness in humans. Cucurbitacin is also used as a lure in insect traps.|$|E

5|$|The court enmities {{provoked}} by his twenty years unbroken intimacy and influence with the king, and the denigration of less gifted or less fortunate soldiers, followed him in death. Prince William expressed <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> of his hatred in almost his last words, and Prince Henry's memoirs give a wholly incredible portrait of Winterfeldt's arrogance, dishonesty, immorality and incapacity. Frederick, however, was not apt to encourage incompetence {{in his most}} trusted officers, {{and as for the}} rest, Winterfeldt stood first among the very few to whom the king gave his friendship and his entire confidence. On hearing of Winterfeldt's death, he said, I will never ever find again another Winterfeldt,and a little later, He was a good man, a soulful man; he was my friend. Winterfeldt's strength was thinking and acting strategically.|$|E
5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match of}} the pay-per-view {{was supposed to}} be Ludvig Borga vs. Tatanka. The two were engaged in a feud that began prior to Survivor Series 1993. Tatanka had been undefeated in the WWF since his debut in 1991. Borga ended this streak on the October 30, 1993 edition of WWF Superstars (taped on September 28, 1993), when he hit Tatanka with a steel chair while the referee was distracted. As a results of storyline injuries from this attack and the beating he suffered afterward at the hands of Borga and Yokozuna, Tatanka was forced to miss the main event match at Survivor Series. Although Tatanka defeated Borga by disqualification on the December 20, 1993 edition of Monday Night Raw, <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> between the two remained.|$|E
5|$|Another issue arose when Cardinal Norman Gilroy {{presented}} Heffron in September 1962 with a {{plan for}} State aid to Catholic Church schools, including assistance for teacher salaries and capital grants for buildings, an issue that was highly explosive in the sectarian politics of New South Wales at the time. Heffron, alive {{to the need for}} a limited form of state support to placate sectarian conflict that could destroy the government, permitted Treasurer Jack Renshaw to include state support for school laboratories and a means-tested allowance to school students in the 1963 budget. Heffron later dropped the school laboratory provision but his permitting of the means-tested allowance provoked condemnation from the Federal Party Executive in Adelaide on 30 September 1962, who were less interested in placating the traditional Catholic hierarchy and more informed by <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> of the earlier ALP/DLP split in the party in 1955. Heffron and Renshaw backed down on this last provision, leaving no state aid for Catholic schools, and affirming the dominance of the Federal party in such matters.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} performed on blend extra virgin olive oils (EVOO) from different cultivars and EVOO from different olive monovarieties (Coratina, Leccino, Maiatica, Ogliarola) with the aim to evaluate the possibility of estimating <b>the</b> perceived <b>bitterness</b> intensity by using chemical indexes, such as the total phenol content and the compounds responsible of oil bitterness measured spectrophotometrically at 225 nm (K 225 value) as bitterness predictors in different EVOO. Therefore, a bitterness predictive model, based {{on the relationship between}} <b>the</b> perceived <b>bitterness</b> intensity of <b>the</b> selected stimuli and the chosen chemicals parameters has been built and validated. The results indicated that <b>the</b> oil <b>bitterness</b> intensity could be satisfactorily predicted by using the K 225 values of oil samples...|$|R

5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is a very}} {{bold and}} {{assertive}} wine that has potential to overwhelm light and delicate dishes. The wine's high tannin content {{as well as the}} oak influences and high alcohol levels associated with many regional styles play important roles in influencing how well the wine matches with different foods. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, all those elements are at their peak, but as the wine ages it mellows; possibilities for different food pairings open up. In most circumstances, matching the weight (alcohol level and body) of the wine to the heaviness of the food is an important consideration. Cabernet Sauvignons with high alcohol levels do not pair well with spicy foods due to hotness levels of the capsaicins present in spices like chili peppers being enhanced by the alcohol with the heat accentuating <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> of the tannins. Milder spices, such as black pepper, pair better due to their ability to minimize the perception of tannins—such as in the classic pairings of Cabernet Sauvignon with steak au poivre and pepper-crusted ahi tuna.|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest and}} fiercest rivalry is with Millwall. The {{two sides are}} local rivals, having both formed {{originally}} around local companies, with players {{living in the same}} localities. The early history of both clubs are intertwined, with West Ham proving to be the more successful in a number of meetings between the two teams at the time, resulting in West Ham being promoted at the expense of Millwall. Millwall later declined to join the fledgling Football League while West Ham went on to the top division and an FA Cup final. Later in the 1920s, the rivalry was intensified during strike action which Isle of Dogs-based companies (i.e., Millwall fans) refused to support, breeding ill will between the two camps, <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> of this betrayal enduring for years. In 1972, a Millwall supporter died at New Cross station after falling out of a train during a fight with West Ham fans.|$|E
5|$|Though the Republican {{legislative}} candidates {{won more}} popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> of the defeat for Lincoln, his {{articulation of the}} issues gave him a national political reputation. In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats-Anzeiger, a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize. In {{the aftermath of the}} 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate in 1860, with William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Simon Cameron looming as rivals for the nomination. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast, and was unsure as to whether he should seek the presidency. In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the 1860 presidential nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed Lincoln for president.|$|E

5|$|McKinley {{increasingly}} {{became a}} significant figure in national politics. In 1880, he served a brief term as Ohio's representative on the Republican National Committee. In 1884, {{he was elected}} a delegate to that year's Republican convention, where he served {{as chair of the}} Committee on Resolutions and won plaudits for his handling of the convention when called upon to preside. By 1886, McKinley, Senator John Sherman, and Governor Joseph B. Foraker were considered the leaders of the Republican party in Ohio. Sherman, who had helped to found the Republican Party, ran three times for the Republican nomination for president in the 1880s, each time failing, while Foraker began a meteoric rise in Ohio politics early in the decade. Hanna, once he entered public affairs as a political manager and generous contributor, supported Sherman's ambitions, {{as well as those of}} Foraker. The latter relationship broke off at the 1888 Republican National Convention, where McKinley, Foraker, and Hanna were all delegates supporting Sherman. Convinced Sherman could not win, Foraker threw his support to the unsuccessful Republican 1884 presidential nominee, Maine Senator James G. Blaine. When Blaine stated he was not a candidate, Foraker returned to Sherman, but the nomination went to former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison, who was elected president. In <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> that followed the convention, Hanna abandoned Foraker, and for the rest of McKinley's life, the Ohio Republican Party was divided into two factions, one aligned with McKinley, Sherman, and Hanna and the other with Foraker. Hanna came to admire McKinley and became a friend and close adviser to him. Although Hanna remained active in business and in promoting other Republicans, in the years after 1888, he spent an increasing amount of time boosting McKinley's political career.|$|E
