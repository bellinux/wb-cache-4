25|$|Straight cup {{wheels are}} an {{alternative}} to cup wheels in <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutter</b> <b>grinders,</b> where having an additional radial grinding surface is beneficial.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutter</b> <b>grinders</b> can {{be adapted}} to {{manufacturing}} precision machine components. The machine, when used for these purposes more likely would be called a CNC Grinding System.|$|R
50|$|The company {{produces}} {{a range of}} computer numerical control (CNC) <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutter</b> <b>grinders</b> to meet large-scale manufacturing and entry-level production requirements. The company also produces medical and dental drills.|$|R
50|$|Today's <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutter</b> <b>grinder</b> is {{typically}} a CNC machine tool, usually 5 axes, which produces endmills, drills, step tools, etc. which {{are widely used}} in the metal cutting and woodworking industries.|$|E
50|$|A flick grinder is {{a surface}} grinder or <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutter</b> <b>grinder,</b> its usage is varied, {{but it may}} be used where great {{accuracy}} is not required, but a machine superior to a bench grinder is required.|$|E
50|$|End mills are {{typically}} made on CNC (computer numeric controlled) <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutter</b> <b>grinder</b> machines under high-pressure lubricants such as water, water-soluble oil, and high-flashpoint oil. Grinding inside {{the machine is}} accomplished with abrasive wheels mounted on a spindle (and in some cases, multiple spindles). Depending on what material is being ground, these wheels are made with industrial diamond (when grinding tungsten carbide), cubic boron nitride (when grinding cobalt steel), and other materials (when grinding, for instance, ceramics), set in a bond (sometimes copper).|$|E
50|$|Grinding is {{prohibited}} {{on the side}} of a typical (disk-shaped) bench grinder wheel, which is designed for grinding on the periphery only. Risk of wheel explosion otherwise threatens. Some <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutter</b> <b>grinders</b> have cup-shaped wheels designed to do grinding on the side.|$|R
50|$|ANCA has {{exported}} approximately 4000 machines, and {{was named}} Australian Exporter of the Year in 1999. The company is also the worldâ€™s leading manufacturer of CNC <b>Tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cutter</b> <b>Grinders.</b> Its new subsidiary, ANCA Motion, is supplying computer controls to other Australian manufacturers and exporting to China and Taiwan.|$|R
50|$|These gauges {{are most}} {{commonly}} used when hand-grinding threading tool bits on a bench grinder, although they may be used with <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutter</b> <b>grinders.</b> When the <b>tool</b> bit has been ground to the correct angle, they may then be used to set the tool perpendicular to the workpiece.|$|R
50|$|A radius grinder (or {{radius tool}} grinder) {{is a special}} grinder used for {{grinding}} the most complex tool forms, and is the historical predecessor to the CNC <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutter</b> <b>grinder.</b> Like the CNC grinder, it {{may be used for}} other tasks where grinding spherical surfaces is necessary. The tool itself consists of three parts: The grinder head, work table, and holding fixture. The grinder head has three degrees of freedom. Vertical movement, movement into the workpeice, and tilt. These are generally set statically, and left fixed throughout operations. The work table is a T-slotted X-axis table mounted on top of a radial fixture. Mounting the X axis on top of the radius table, as opposed to the other way around, allows for complex and accurate radius grinds. The holding fixtures can be anything one can mount on a slotted table, but most commonly used is a collet or chuck fixture that indexes and has a separate Y movement to allow accurate depth setting and endmill sharpening. The dressers used on these grinders are usually quite expensive, and can dress the grinding wheel itself with a particular radius.|$|E

40|$|Intense reseach in {{material}} science {{has been directed}} towards {{the development of new}} light-weight engineering materials possessing high specific strength and stiffness at elevated temperatures combined with good creep, fatigue and wear resistance. Advanced automotive and aerospace technologies require such material specification for enhanced performance. These properties are not achievable with light weight monolithic titanium, aluminium and magnesium alloys. Hence designers resort to composite materials such as Fiber Reinforced Plastics (FRP), Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) and Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC). The density of most MMC's is approximately one third that of steel, resulting in high specific strength and stiffness. MMC's find application in different industries like aerospace (for fuselage of space shuttle orbiter, vertical tail section of advanced fighter planes), automobile engine parts (piston, cylinder liners, brake drums), sports equipment and shipping application etc.,. Especially aluminium alloys reinforced with silicon carbide are relatively new, potentially useful structural materials with high specific stregth and modulus values. Although components made of these materials, can be produced by near-net-shape manufacturing, they usually require subsequent machining to attain the desired geometry, assembling tolerance and surface integrity. However, being non-hoogeneous, anisotropic and reinforced b abrasive components, these materials are difficult t achne. Machinability {{is one of the major}} problems, which restricts the wide spread engineering application of meal matrix composites. Grinding is partislarly needed to acquire controlled specifications such as high dimensional acuracy and surface finish. The presen study is concerned with evaluation of grindability of Al/SiCp composite in terms of work material and wheel material response to grinding environment. Surface grinding was carried out on a <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutter</b> <b>grinder</b> and the performance indicators namely grinding force, temperature, acoustc emision (AE) and vibration induced were monitored online. Ground surfaces were observed through scanning electron microscope (SEM), for assessing the surface texture. samples of chips collected during grinding were observed through scannng electron microscope, for process status evaluation...|$|E

50|$|Modern CNC <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutter</b> <b>grinders</b> enhance {{productivity}} by typically offering {{features such}} as automatic tool loading {{as well as the}} ability to support multiple grinding wheels. High levels of automation, as well as automatic in-machine <b>tool</b> measurement <b>and</b> compensation, allow extended periods of unmanned production. With careful process configuration <b>and</b> appropriate <b>tool</b> support, tolerances less than 5 micrometres (0.0002") can be consistently achieved even on the most complex parts.|$|R
5000|$|Significant {{software}} advancements {{have allowed}} CNC <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutter</b> <b>grinders</b> to be utilized {{in a wide}} range of industries. Advanced CNC grinders feature sophisticated software that allows geometrically complex parts to be designed either parametrically or by using third party CAD/CAM software. 3D simulation of the entire grinding process and the finished part is possible as well as detection of any potential mechanical collisions and calculation of production time. Such features allow parts to be designed and verified, as well as the production process optimized, entirely within the software environment.|$|R

40|$|This is {{a report}} on the {{accuracy}} of machining which is changed by a rise in temperature of main spindle. The machine <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutters</b> used in this experiment were a bed-type milling machine and end mills made of high speed steel respectively. The following conclusions were obtained. 1. In the case of high revolution number, the temperature of main spindle has risen remarkably for an hour. Since a dislocation of main spindle and a error of cutting surface increase with rise in temperature of it, a predrive is required. 2. The predrive had better be done in higher revolution number than used cutting condition. In this experiment, the revolution number of predrive is two times as many rotations as that of main spindle used, so that accuracy of work obtained by predrive only twenty minutes is sufficientl...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} part of {{a research}} program which has been under way at the CIM Centre at Swinburne University of Technology since 1989. The purpose of the research program was to develop an open-architecture machine <b>tool</b> control system <b>and</b> then {{to see how that}} system could be used to change the distribution of traditional manufacturing design, planning and control functions. This paper examines one part of that research program and focuses on a methodology which could prove to be useful in the machine <b>tool</b> selection, <b>cutter</b> selection <b>and</b> <b>cutter</b> path generation phases of process planning for cutting operations on workpieces in computer-controlled machine tools. It is suggested that a configuration space transform be used for each cutter/machine tool combination to find the volume that the combination could remove from the uncut workpiece without removing any of the material that will form the final workpiece. A method of comparing these volumes from different combinations is then outlined. The output of this method is a 'reasonable' sequence of machine <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutters.</b> Path planning can then be carried out for each of the chosen combinations using a method similar to the one used to find the possible volume to be removed. Possible implementation techniques, and their limitations on existing computer hardware, are discussed and the most promising of these are identified, based upon some properties of configuration space transforms...|$|R
50|$|Tool making {{typically}} means making tooling used {{to produce}} products. Common tooling includes metal forming rolls, cutting tools (such as <b>tool</b> bits <b>and</b> milling <b>cutters),</b> fixtures, or even whole machine tools used to manufacture, hold, or test products during their fabrication. Due to the unique nature of a tool maker's work, it is often necessary to fabricate custom tools or modify standard tools.|$|R

40|$|Milling is {{a process}} of {{producing}} flat and complex shapes with the use of multi-tooth cutting tool, which is called a milling <b>cutter</b> <b>and</b> the cutting edges are called teeth. The axis of rotation of the cutting tool is perpendicular to the direction of feed, either parallel or perpendicular to the machined surface. The machine tool that traditionally performs this operation is a milling machine. Milling is an interrupted cutting operation: the teeth of the milling <b>cutter</b> enter <b>and</b> exit the work during each revolution. This interrupted cutting action subjects the teeth to a cycle of impact force and thermal shock on every rotation. The <b>tool</b> material <b>and</b> <b>cutter</b> geometry must be designed to withstand these conditions. Cutting fluids are essential for most milling operations. In this Paper the design aspects of milling cutter is analyzed. The objective considered is the design and modeling of milling <b>cutter</b> <b>and</b> to analyse various stress components acting on it. Various designing strategies are considered to design the effective milling cutter like outer diameter, inner diameter, radius, teeth angle etc. The design and analysis is carried out using the softwares like CATIA V 5 and ANSYS...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFive-axis {{machining}} allows continuous {{adjustment of}} cutter orientation along a tool pass. Unfortunately, the flexibility {{has not been}} fully exploited due to the separate consideration of <b>tool</b> path generation <b>and</b> <b>cutter</b> orientation in current machining methods. This paper presents an integrated method (IM) for tool path generation, which is tightly integrated with the orientation strategy, to minimise tool path length under the constraint of smooth cutter orientation. Distinctively, cutter orientation along a tool pass is optimised by balancing considerations of maximum material removal <b>and</b> smoothness of <b>cutter</b> movement. Further, the intervals between successive tool passes are maximised according to the optimised orientation. In the paper, the IM is combined with the quadric method, a recently developed cutter orientation strategy, for iso-parametric machining with a flat-end cutter. However, the method {{could be applied to}} other orientation strategies with different machining mechanisms <b>and</b> <b>cutter</b> types. Simulated examples illustrate that the IM is more efficient in machining than established methods...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for the modeling and simulation of surface generation in the potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) crystal fly cutting machining process in the macro, micro, and nano scales, {{in order for the}} evaluation specifications in different spatial frequency region. The main influential factors of surface topography in different scales are discussed and modeled by different methods. The simulations take into account all the intricate aspects of the machining process affecting the surface topography and texture formation such as the straightness of the slide, the dynamic performance of the machine <b>tool,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>cutter</b> profile. This method can realize the machine <b>tool</b> performance <b>and</b> machining parameter optimization by the surface prediction and detection. The numerical calculation (NC) and the finite element (FE) method are used in the macro and micro scales. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is used in the nano scale. Furthermore, the proposed systematic modeling approach is verified by cutting trials which provide the coincident results of the simulated surface topography...|$|R
50|$|Indexable {{drill bits}} are {{primarily}} used in CNC and other high precision or production equipment, {{and are the}} most expensive type of drill bit, costing the most per diameter and length. Like indexable lathe <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> milling <b>cutters,</b> they use replaceable carbide or ceramic inserts as a cutting face to alleviate {{the need for a}} tool grinder. One insert is responsible for the outer radius of the cut, and another insert is responsible for the inner radius. The tool itself handles the point deformity, as it is a low-wear task. The bit is hardened and coated against wear far more than the average drill bit, as the shank is non-consumable. Almost all indexable drill bits have multiple coolant channels for prolonged tool life under heavy usage. They are also readily available in odd configurations, such as straight flute, fast spiral, multiflute, and a variety of cutting face geometries.|$|R
