The critical goal is to support the learner in becoming an effective thinker. This can be achieved by assuming multiple roles, such as consultant and coach.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis is first of all to {{investigate}} how <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>environments</b> in our two case companies, Sport ApS and Optik A/S, are structured and which possibilities and barriers these structures involve in relation to employee competence development. Secondly, we endeavour to analyse how these <b>learning</b> <b>environments</b> may be developed {{in order to support}} the development of employee competences better. This is done through five analyses: Analysis of the companies’ surroundings, Analysis of the companies’ frameworks and institutionalizations, Comparative theme analysis: an MD perspective, Comparative theme analysis: an employee perspective, and Analysis of the companies as design for learning. From these analyses we can conclude that <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>environments</b> in general provide good <b>learning</b> conditions for <b>the</b> employees. This primarily {{has to do with the}} fact that the latter have ample opportunity to engage themselves in their respective companies, along with great latitude to define and negotiate their own practices. At the same time there is, however, a tendency to leave the employees to their own devices, as the management only to a lesser extent contributes to the creation of favourable settings and circumstances for <b>learning</b> in <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>environments.</b> Consequently, it is often the most privileged communities of practice, and the strongest negotiators within these, who benefit from <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> opportunities in <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>environments.</b> Creating a fine <b>learning</b> <b>environment</b> therefore requires <b>the</b> management to assume responsibility for competence development instead of simply placing it on the shoulders of the employees. It is important to prepare the ground for the development of competences and to focus continuously on the possibilities and barriers which lie in <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>environments</b> of <b>the</b> companies. Furthermore, it is central to the future working life and occupational prospects of the employees that they do not develop company-specific competences alone. Thus, creating better possibilities for external education in <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>environments</b> is equally important if the competence development of the employees is to be supported more efficiently...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a software toolkit called Indie, for building hybrid Investigate and Decide (Indie) <b>learning</b> <b>environments.</b> In Indie <b>learning</b> <b>environments,</b> students can run simulated experiments, construct reports arguing for different claims, and submit these reports for critiquing. <b>The</b> Indie <b>learning</b> <b>environment</b> {{is one example}} of the Goal-based Scenario (GBS) learn-by-doing environments.

25|$|It is {{important}} to achieve the right balance between the degree of structure and flexibility that {{is built into the}} learning process. Savery (1994) contends that the more structured <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>environment,</b> the harder it is for the learners to construct meaning based on their conceptual understandings. A facilitator should structure the learning experience just enough {{to make sure that the}} students get clear guidance and parameters within which to achieve the learning objectives, yet the learning experience should be open and free enough to allow for the learners to discover, enjoy, interact and arrive at their own, socially verified version of truth.|$|E
