50|$|The trigger assembly, which {{includes}} the trigger, hammer, sear, and <b>trigger</b> <b>body</b> with guard, can be removed by pushing out one retaining pin and pulling downwards on the guard (if a pistol grip is installed, it usually must be removed first as virtually all such grips obstruct {{the removal of the}} <b>trigger</b> <b>body).</b> The elevator can be removed by putting the gun on safety and squeezing the sides together, freeing the pivot pins from the receiver. The fore-end can then be moved to the rear, allowing the bolt and bolt carrier to drop out, and then the forend can be removed by moving it forward. The cartridge stop and interrupter will then fall free, leaving just the ejector and the safety in the receiver, held in by screws. The magazine spring and follower may be removed by unscrewing the tube from the receiver (this may be difficult on some new 500s). This level of field stripping is sufficient to allow all components to be cleaned.|$|E
50|$|The trigger uses several {{components}} {{that make it}} safe, and yet simple to maintain. Within the trigger there is the long silver-colored AccuRelease lever mounted within the <b>trigger</b> <b>body</b> and sharing the trigger's pivot point in the housing. When at rest, the forward {{upper end of the}} AccuRelease is positioned directly behind the sear, where it will block the sear should any external force cause it to jar out of the trigger notch. In normal operation, the trigger finger will first take up and depress the AccuRelease lever so that its forward tip drops out of the path of the sear, allowing the sear to move fully backward when released by the trigger at whatever weight you have adjusted the trigger pull to be.|$|E
5000|$|Pistols {{made and}} {{imported}} by Glock Ges.m.b.H., {{such as the}} Glock 17, incorporate a design with three levels of integrated safety, known as safe action; there are no external safety switches on these handguns. First, an integrated trigger latch prevents the <b>trigger</b> <b>body</b> from moving unless the trigger is positively squeezed. Second, the gun's striker-firing mechanism is locked in place by an extension bar linked to the trigger; the striker cannot move unless the trigger is depressed. Third, as with most pistols, a firing pin block actuated by the same extension bar prevents the pin coming {{into contact with the}} primer unless the trigger is pulled to clear the block. Although not generally considered a safety feature, the resting state of the gun (excluding a dry/misfire) has the striker in a [...] "half-cocked" [...] state; pulling the trigger will fully cock the weapon before releasing the striker, and the mechanism is designed to have insufficient force to ignite the primer of an active cartridge from this state even if the sear lock and firing pin block both fail.|$|E

50|$|These safeties, {{similar to}} grip safeties, are de-activated {{as a natural}} {{consequence}} of the shooter firing the firearm, but are engaged in most other circumstances. The trigger is composed of two interdependent parts, and the shooter in firing the firearm manipulates both parts of the trigger. Conversely, unintentional pressure or a strike against the trigger is unlikely to do so, and such an action will not fire the firearm. Such a design, made popular by Glock pistols but originally used in the 1897 Iver Johnson Second Model Safety Hammerless revolver, incorporates a trigger with a spring-loaded lever in its lower half. This lever which protrudes from the trigger face must be fully depressed in order to disengage a lock that allows the main <b>trigger</b> <b>body</b> to move. Unintentional pressure against {{the top of the}} trigger without pressing the lever does not disengage the lock and the trigger will not move. Other designs include a spring-loaded pad that forms the upper portion of the trigger face and manipulates a similar lock. This design has more moving parts, but is advantageous in that accidental pressure on the lock release has reduced leverage thus requiring more force to pull the main trigger, where force against the lower portion does not release the lock and will not move the trigger.|$|E
40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{empirical}} studies have revealed that diaphragmatic breathing may <b>trigger</b> <b>body</b> relaxation responses and benefit both physical and mental health. However, the specific benefits of diaphragmatic breathing on mental health remain largely unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of diaphragmatic breathing on cognition, affect, and cortisol responses to stress. Forty participants {{were randomly assigned to}} either a breathing intervention group (BIG) or a control group (CG). The BIG received intensive training for 20 sessions, implemented over 8 weeks, employing a real-time feedback device, and an average respiratory rate of 4 breaths/min, while the CG did not receive this treatment. All participants completed pre- and post-tests of sustained attention and affect. Additionally, pre-test and post-test salivary cortisol concentrations were determined in both groups. The findings suggested that the BIG showed a significant decrease in negative affect after intervention, compared to baseline. In the diaphragmatic breathing condition, there was a significant interaction effect of group by time on sustained attention, whereby the BIG showed significantly increased sustained attention after training, compared to baseline. There was a significant interaction effect of group and time in the diaphragmatic breathing condition on cortisol levels, whereby the BIG had a significantly lower cortisol level after training, while the CG showed no significant change in cortisol levels. In conclusion, diaphragmatic breathing could improve sustained attention, affect, and cortisol levels. This study provided evidence demonstrating the effect of diaphragmatic breathing, a mind-body practice, on mental function, from a health psychology approach, which has important implications for health promotion in healthy individuals...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{bio-inspired}} autopilot is presented, {{in which}} body saccadic and intersaccadic systems are combined. This autopilot enables a simulated hovercraft to travel along corridors comprising L-junctions, U-shaped and S-shaped turns, relying on minimalistic motion vision cues alone without measuring its speed or distance from walls, {{in much the}} same way as flies and bees manage their flight in similar situations. The saccadic system responsible for avoiding frontal collisions <b>triggers</b> yaw <b>body</b> saccades with appropriately quantified angles based simply on a few local optic flow measurements, giving the angle of incidence with respect to a frontal wall. The simulated robot negotiates stiff bends by <b>triggering</b> <b>body</b> saccades to realign its trajectory, thus traveling parallel with the wall along a corridor comprising sharp turns. Direct comparison shows that the performance of this new body saccade-based autopilot closely resembles the behavior of a fly using similar body saccade strategy when flying along a corridor with an S-shaped turn, despite the huge differences in terms of the inertia...|$|R

5000|$|Also {{known as}} passivity, submissiveness entails {{following}} someone else's desires and requests {{without regard for}} one's own needs. This is colloquially referred to as [...] "putting someone else's needs before your own", and is most common in individuals with low self-esteem. A submissive person can typically agree to anything, even at significant personal inconvenience. For example, if a person wants to eat pizza, and another wants to eat eggs and bacon, a submissive person might just go with the other person's idea, while an assertive person would seek a compromise that would satisfy both (which could include following one person's idea one day, and the other person's idea next time they meet). This is also in correlation with the fight-or-flight response. An submissive person would typically choose the 'flight' response and avoid confrontation, whereas an assertive person would choose the 'fight' response, and assert their own needs. This response ties in with emotions as well. Different emotions can trigger these responses. Anger can either <b>trigger</b> the <b>body</b> to clench an object forcefully (fight), or it can <b>trigger</b> the <b>body</b> {{to walk away from}} the situated area (flight).|$|R

40|$|Diabetes {{and obesity}} are two {{metabolic}} diseases characterized by insulin resistance and a low-grade inflammation Seeking an inflammatory factor causative of {{the onset of}} insulin resistance, obesity, and diabetes, we have identified bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a triggering factor. We found that normal endotoxemia increased or decreased during the fed or fasted state, respectively, on a nutritional basis and that a 4 -week high-fat diet chronically increased plasma LPS concentration two to three times, a threshold that we have defined as metabolic endotoxemia. Importantly, a high-fat diet increased the proportion of an LPS-containing microbiota in the gut. When metabolic endotoxemia was induced for 4 weeks in mice through continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS, fasted glycemia and insulinemia and whole-body, liver, and adipose tissue weight gain were increased to a similar extent as in highfat-fed mice. In addition, adipose tissue F 4 / 80 -positive cells and markers of inflammation, and liver triglyceride content, were increased. Furthermore, liver, but not wholebody, insulin resistance was detected in LPS-infused mice. CD 14 mutant mice resisted most of the LPS and high-fat diet-induced features of metabolic diseases. This new finding demonstrates that metabolic endotoxemia dysregulates the inflammatory tone and <b>triggers</b> <b>body</b> weight gain and diabetes. We conclude that the LPS/CD 14 system sets the tone of insulin sensitivity and the onset of diabetes and obesity. Lowering plasma LPS concentration could be a potent strategy for the control of metabolic diseases...|$|R
