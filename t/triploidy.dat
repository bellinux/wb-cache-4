Please cite this article as doi: 10. 1002 /pd. 4711 Objective To describe {{the distribution of the}} fetal nuchal translucency thickness (NT) according to type of chromosomal aberration in a large unselected population. Methods Data on pregnancies with an NT measurement performed at gestational age 11 + 3 – 13 + 6 weeks from 2008 – 2011 were retrieved from the Danish National Fetal Medicine Database. Information on any genetic analysis for aneuploidy performed pre- or postnatally was also obtained. The abnormal results were grouped into 14 types of chromosomal anomalies. Distributions of NT measurements were summarized by aberration and compared with the normal/no karyotype group. Results 215, 223 singleton pregnancies were included in the cohort. 10, 548 had a normal karyotype and 1, 286 had an aberration. Plots of the NT measurements showed that like trisomy 21, 18, and 13 and monosomy X, the distribution for the unbalanced translocations was shifted towards larger NTs. The distributions for the balanced translocations, the uncommon trisomies and the <b>triploidies</b> more closely resembled that of the normal/no karyotype population. Conclusion Fetuses with aneuploidies have NT distributions visually different from normal fetuses, with the exception of <b>triploidies</b> and uncommon autosomal trisomies. The distributions differ in shape according to type of chromosomal anomaly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Genomic {{imprinting}} is {{an important}} epigenetic process involved in regulating placental and foetal growth. Imprinted genes are typically associated with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) whereby {{one of the two}} alleles is DNA methylated depending on the parent of origin. Identifying imprinted DMRs in humans is complicated by species- and tissue-specific differences in imprinting status and the presence of multiple regulatory regions associated with a particular gene, only some of which may be imprinted. In this study, we have taken advantage of the unbalanced parental genomic constitutions in <b>triploidies</b> to further characterize human DMRs associated with known imprinted genes and identify novel imprinted DMRs. Results By comparing the promoter methylation status of over 14, 000 genes in human placentas from ten diandries (extra paternal haploid set) and ten digynies (extra maternal haploid set) and using 6 complete hydatidiform moles (paternal origin) and ten chromosomally normal placentas for comparison, we identified 62 genes with apparently imprinted DMRs (false discovery rate FAM 50 B, as well as novel imprinted DMRs associated with known imprinted genes (for example, CDKN 1 C and RASGRF 1) can be identified by using this approach. Furthermore, we have demonstrated how comparison of DNA methylation for known imprinted genes (for example, GNAS and CDKN 1 C) between placentas of different gestations and other somatic tissues (brain, kidney, muscle and blood) provides a detailed analysis of specific CpG sites associated with tissue-specific imprinting and gestational age-specific methylation. Conclusions DNA methylation profiling of <b>triploidies</b> in different tissues and developmental ages can be a powerful and effective way to map and characterize imprinted regions in the genome. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{examination}} of the product of conception after spontaneous abortion reveals that in about 60 % of cases a chromosome abnormality is present, and that in only 1 % of cases the abnormality is transmitted by parents. This survey deals with 381 cases of spontaneous abortion, and 670 cases of abortion induced for psychological or socioeconomical reasons, and with the cytogenetic {{examination of}} the aborted materials to study the anatomo-pathological modifications of the embryo. 29. 23 % of the embryos examined in the first series presented chromosome abnormalities, ranging, in decreasing order, from trisomies, to <b>triploidies,</b> to monosomies, compared to only 1. 93 % in the second series.

25|$|Complete {{tetraploidy}} is {{more rarely}} diagnosed than <b>triploidy,</b> but is observed in 1–2% of early miscarriages. However, some tetraploid cells are {{commonly found in}} chromosome analysis at prenatal diagnosis and these are generally considered 'harmless'.

25|$|Although all {{the plants}} are {{technically}} separate in that {{each has its own}} root system, they are collectively considered {{to be one of the}} oldest living plant clones. Each plant's life span is approximately 300 years, but the plant has been cloning itself for at least 43,600 years (possibly up to 135,000 years). This estimate is based on the radiocarbon dating of fossilised leaf fragments that were found 8.5km (5.3mi) away. The fossilised fragments are identical to the contemporary plant in cell structure and shape, which indicates that both plants are triploid and therefore clones due to the extreme rarity of the occurrence of <b>triploidy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Studies {{show that}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA variation occurs substantially in polygyne societies (nests with multiple queens), but no variation is detected in monogyne societies (nests {{with a single}} queen). <b>Triploidy</b> (a chromosomal abnormality) occurs in red imported fire ants at high rates (as high as 12% in non-reproductive females), which {{is linked to the}} high frequency of diploid males. The red imported fire ant is the first species shown to possess a green-beard gene, by which natural selection can favour altruistic behaviour. Workers containing this gene are able to distinguish between queens containing it, and those that do not, apparently by using odour cues. The workers kill queens that do not contain the gene. In 2011, scientists announced they had fully sequenced the red imported fire ant genome from a male.|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} 20 years {{non-invasive}} screening tests have been increasingly utilized in prenatal diagnosis (PD) practice. Considerable {{effort has been}} exerted by multicenter consortia to evaluate the reliability of non-invasive screening tests in detecting those women with {{an increased risk of}} having a pregnancy affected by trisomies 21, 18, and 13, monosomy X, and <b>triploidies.</b> To what extent this group of abnormal karyotypes accounts for the total number of phenotypically relevant fetal chromosome abnormalities has, however, never been investigated. The present report is an attempt aimed to quantify this proportion. A retrospective analysis of a homogeneous survey of 115, 128 consecutive invasive prenatal tests was undertaken. All cases were classified in accordance with the indication given for the invasive testing. Cytogenetic results regarding 96, 416 karyotype analyses performed because of advanced maternal age (>or= 35 years) or gestational anxiety (50 % in women >or= 35 years (65. 1 % and 61. 8 %, respectively).

40|$|The {{development}} of chromosome-specific probes (CSP) and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) has allowed for very rapid identification of selected numerical abnormalities. We attempt here to determine, in principle, {{what percentage of}} abnormalities would be detectable if only CSP-FISH were performed without karyotype for prenatal diagnosis. A total of 146 128 consecutive karyotypes for prenatal diagnosis from eight centres in four countries for 5 years were compared with predicted detection if probes for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y were used, and assuming 100 % detection efficiency. A total of 4163 abnormalities (2. 85 %) were found including 2889 (69. 4 %) (trisomy 21, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, numerical sex chromosome abnormalities, and <b>triploidies)</b> which were considered detectable by FISH. Of these, 1274 were mosaics, translocations, deletions, inversions, rings, and markers which would not be considered detectable. CSP-FISH is a useful adjunct to karyotype for high risk situations, and may be appropriate in low risk screening, but should {{not be seen as}} a replacement for karyotype as too many structural chromosome abnormalities will be misse...|$|R
40|$|Deletions and amplifications of {{the human}} genomic {{sequence}} (copy number polymorphisms) are the cause of numerous diseases and a potential cause of phenotypic variation in the normal population. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has been developed as {{a useful tool for}} detecting alterations in DNA copy number that involve blocks of DNA several kilobases or larger in size. We have developed high-resolution CGH (HR-CGH) to detect accurately and with relatively little bias the presence and extent of chromosomal aberrations in human DNA. Maskless array synthesis was used to construct arrays containing 385, 000 oligonucleotides with isothermal probes of 45 – 85 bp in length; arrays tiling the β-globin locus and chromosome 22 q were prepared. Arrays with a 9 -bp tiling path were used to map a 622 -bp heterozygous deletion in the β-globin locus. Arrays with an 85 -bp tiling path were used to analyze DNA from patients with copy number changes in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 22 q. Heterozygous deletions and duplications as well as partial <b>triploidies</b> and partial tetraploidies of portions of chromosome 22 q were mapped with high resolution (typically up to 200 bp) in each patient, and the precise breakpoints of two deletions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Additional peaks potentially corresponding to known and novel additional CNPs were also observed. Our results demonstrate that HR-CGH allows the detection of copy number changes in the human genome at an unprecedented level of resolution...|$|R
25|$|<b>Triploidy</b> may be {{the result}} of either digyny (the extra haploid set is from the mother) or diandry (the extra haploid set is from the father). Diandry is mostly caused by {{reduplication}} of the paternal haploid set from a single sperm, but may also be the consequence of dispermic (two sperm) fertilization of the egg. Digyny is most commonly caused by either failure of one meiotic division during oogenesis leading to a diploid oocyte or failure to extrude one polar body from the oocyte. Diandry appears to predominate among early miscarriages, while digyny predominates among triploid zygotes that survive into the fetal period. However, among early miscarriages, digyny is also more common in those cases <8.5 weeks gestational age or those in which an embryo is present. There are also two distinct phenotypes in triploid placentas and fetuses that are dependent on the origin of the extra haploid set. In digyny, there is typically an asymmetric poorly grown fetus, with marked adrenal hypoplasia and a very small placenta. In diandry, a partial hydatidiform mole develops. These parent-of-origin effects reflect the effects of genomic imprinting.|$|E
2500|$|Chromosomal {{abnormalities}} {{are found}} {{in more than half}} of embryos miscarried in the first 13 weeks. Half of embryonic miscarriages (25% of all miscarriages) have an aneuploidy (abnormal number of chromosomes). [...] Common chromosome abnormalities found in miscarriages include autosomal trisomy (22-32%), monosomy X (5-20%), <b>triploidy</b> (6-8%), tetraploidy (2-4%), or other structural chromosomal abnormalities (2%). Genetic problems are more likely to occur with older parents; this may account for the higher rates observed in older women.|$|E
2500|$|Autopolyploids are polyploids with {{multiple}} chromosome sets {{derived from a}} single taxon. Two examples of natural autopolyploids are the piggyback plant, Tolmiea menzisii and the white sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanum. [...] Most instances of autopolyploidy result from the fusion of unreduced (2n) gametes, which results in either triploid (n + 2n = 3n) or tetraploid (2n + 2n = 4n) offspring. Triploid offspring are typically sterile (as in the phenomenon of 'triploid block'), {{but in some cases}} they may produce high proportions of unreduced gametes and thus aid the formation of tetraploids. This pathway to tetraploidy {{is referred to as the}} “triploid bridge”. Triploids may also persist through asexual reproduction. In fact, stable autotriploidy in plants is often associated with apomictic mating systems. In agricultural systems, autotriploidy can result in seedlessness, as in watermelons and bananas. <b>Triploidy</b> is also utilized in salmon and trout farming to induce sterility.|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of prenatal screening requires rapid high-throughput diagnosis of common aneuploidies. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) allows for quick, easily automated multiplex testing of these aneuploidies in one polymerase chain reaction. We performed a large prospective study using MLPA on 4000 amniotic fluid (AF) samples including all indications and compared its value to karyotyping and fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH). MLPA can reliably determine common aneuploidies with 100 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity. Moreover, some mosaic cases and structural chromosome aberrations were detected as well. In cases of a male fetus, <b>triploidies</b> can be detected by an aberrant pattern of probe signals, which mimics maternal cell contamination (MCC). Macroscopic blood contamination was encountered in 3. 2 % of the AF samples. In 20 % of these samples, an MLPA pattern was found consistent with MCC, although there were no false negatives of the most common aneuploidies. As the vast majority of inconclusive results (1. 7 %) is due to potential MCC, we designed a protocol in which we determine whether MLPA can be performed on blood-contaminated AF samples by testing if blood is of fetal origin. Then, the number of inconclusive results could be theoretically reduced to 0. 05 %. We propose an alternative interpretation of relative probe signals for rapid aneuploidy diagnosis (RAD). We discuss the value of MLPA for the detection of (submicroscopic) structural chromosome anomalies. MLPA is a reliable method that can replace FISH and {{could be used as a}} stand-alone test for RAD instead of karyotyping...|$|R
40|$|International audienceObjective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} antenatal prognostic factors of neonatal outcomes in cases of fetal echogenic bowel (FEB). Study design: A retrospective study in three tertiary referral centers including fetal echogenic bowel over a 10 -year period (from January 2003 to December 2013). The echogenicity of the fetal bowel was graded from 1 to 3, according to Slotnick's definition. Associated echographic findings such as bowel dilations, gallbladder abnormalities, calcifications, extra-abdominal abnormalities, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and a decrease in amniotic fluid volume, if present were also recorded. This was followed by the FEB's sonographic evolution. The sonographic evolution was considered favorable if it was stable or decreasing and unfavorable if the echogenicity of the bowel increased or if additional sonographic findings appeared. Neonates had a pediatric examination in the delivery room and upon discharge from the maternity hospital. An outcome was considered good in the case of on-term delivery of a newborn with normal clinical examination and meconium elimination. Results: Complete pregnancy outcome data were available for 409 pregnancies. 338 newborns had uneventful outcomes (82. 6 %). Antenatal exploration diagnosed 4 cases of aneuploidy (1 case of trisomy 13, 1 case of trisomy 18 and 2 cases of <b>triploidies),</b> 16 cases of congenital infections, 9 cases of cystic fibrosis and 11 cases of bowel abnormalities. After a multivariate analysis, we discovered the sonographic grade of the echogenic bowel was not a prognostic factor of neonatal outcome. The isolated fetal echogenic bowel had a 6. 6 -fold increase chance of uneventful outcomes (adjusted odd ratio (aOR) 6. 6, 95 % CI 3 - 14. 4). Notably, favorable sonographic evolution (aOR 8. 1, 95 % CI 4. 1 - 16) and late gestational age at the time of the diagnosis (aOR 1. 17, 95 % CI 1. 07 - 1. 27) are independent, good prognostic factors of good neonatal outcomes. None of the 180 fetuses with isolated fetal echogenic bowel and favorable sonographic evolution had adverse outcomes. Among these, 4 cases (0. 98 %) of aneuploidy, 17 cases (4. 2 %) of congenital infections and 9 cases (2. 2 %) of cystic fibroses were also diagnosed. No cases of Down syndrome (DS) were reported. Conclusion: Our study shows that the grade should not be considered a prognostic factor of neonatal outcomes. Our data suggests the need to reevaluate the concept of systematic amniocentesis. Sonographic evolution of fetal bowel is an independent, strong prognostic factor for good neonatal outcomes. It also better defines the FEB prognostic. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V.
