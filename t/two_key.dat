5000|$|A {{keyboard}} with [...] "two-key rollover" [...] can reliably detect only any <b>two</b> <b>keys</b> used simultaneously; {{in other}} words, a user can hold down any key {{on the keyboard}} and press a second key, and {{be sure that the}} keypress is correctly detected by the computer. However, if the user has <b>two</b> <b>keys</b> depressed and attempts to strike a third key, the third keypress may create a [...] "phantom key" [...] by shorting out the switch matrix. This is not acceptable for quality keyboards because there are many cases when more than <b>two</b> <b>keys</b> need to be depressed at the same time, such as Ctrl-Alt-Delete, or when more than <b>two</b> <b>keys</b> are depressed because of fast typing ("rolling over" [...] more than <b>two</b> <b>keys).</b>|$|R

5|$|Earlier {{cell cycle}} checkpoints such as post-restriction point check between G1 phase and S phase {{similarly}} involve proteasomal degradation of cyclin A, whose ubiquitination is {{promoted by the}} anaphase promoting complex (APC), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The APC and the Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein complex (SCF complex) are the <b>two</b> <b>key</b> regulators of cyclin degradation and checkpoint control; the SCF itself is regulated by the APC via ubiquitination of the adaptor protein, Skp2, which prevents SCF activity before the G1-S transition.|$|E
5|$|Juan José Castelli was {{the main}} speaker for the revolutionaries. He based his speech on <b>two</b> <b>key</b> ideas: the government's lapsed legitimacy—he stated that the Supreme Central Junta was {{dissolved}} and had no rights to designate a Regency—and the principle of retroversion of sovereignty. He spoke after Riega, and replied that the American people should assume control of their government until FerdinandVII could return to the throne.|$|E

5|$|At Sony Music Entertainment, Kutaragi {{worked closely}} with Shigeo Maruyama, the CEO of Sony Music, and with Akira Sato to form Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCEI) on November 16, 1993. A {{building}} block of SCEI was its initial partnership with Sony Music which helped SCEI attract creative talent to the company as well as assist SCEI in manufacturing, marketing and producing discs, something that Sony Music had been doing with Music Discs. The final <b>two</b> <b>key</b> members of SCEI were Terry Tokunaka, the President of SCEI from Sony's headquarters, and Olaf Olafsson. Olafsson was CEO and president of New York-based Sony Interactive Entertainment which was the mother company for the 1994-founded Sony Computer Entertainment of America (SCEA).|$|E
5|$|Bavaro {{performed}} well the during the 1987 season and was again selected to the Pro Bowl. He finished {{the season with}} 55 receptions, 867yards, and 8 touchdowns. He followed that with 53 receptions, 672yards, and 4 touchdowns in 1988. After failing to miss a game due to injury in his first four seasons, Bavaro struggled with knee injuries in 1989 and was limited to seven games. He came back to play in 15 games in 1990. The Giants started the season 10–0 and finished 13–3. They advanced to Super Bowl XXV where they played the Buffalo Bills. During the game Bavaro made <b>two</b> <b>key</b> third down receptions to keep scoring drives alive as the Giants won 20–19.|$|E
5|$|By October Axis {{operational}} objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region were achieved, {{with only the}} sieges of Leningrad and Sevastopol continuing. A major offensive against Moscow was renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend their offensive. Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: <b>two</b> <b>key</b> cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential. The blitzkrieg phase {{of the war in}} Europe had ended.|$|E

5|$|Holy Roman {{emperors}} {{had been}} elected from the House of Habsburg {{for most of the}} previous three centuries. Charles VI arranged a marriage of his eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, to Francis of Lorraine. Francis relinquished the Duchy of Lorraine near France in exchange for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany near Austria to make himself a more appealing candidate for eventual election as emperor. On paper, many heads of state and, most importantly, the rulers of the German states of the Holy Roman Empire, accepted the Pragmatic Sanction and the idea of Francis as the next emperor. <b>Two</b> <b>key</b> exceptions, the duchies of Bavaria and Saxony, held important electoral votes and could impede or even block Francis's election. When Charles died in 1740, Maria Theresa had to fight for her family's entitlements in Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia, and her husband faced competition in his election as the Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Much of our {{information}} about the first Marshalsea is about the prison in the early 18th-century, courtesy of three sources. John Baptist Grano (1692 – c. 1748), one of George Frederick Handel's trumpeters at the opera house in London's Haymarket, was jailed there for a debt of £99 (£ today), and kept a detailed diary, A Journal of My Life inside the Marshalsea, of his 458-day incarceration from 30 May 1728 until 23 September 1729. The other <b>two</b> <b>key</b> sources are a 1729 report by a parliamentary committee, led by James Oglethorpe MP, {{on the state of}} the Fleet and the Marshalsea, and the subsequent murder trial that year of William Acton, the Marshalsea's chief jailor.|$|E

5|$|On August 2, 2006, quarterback Rhett Bomar and {{offensive}} lineman J.D. Quinn, both sophomores, were dismissed from the team. It {{was reported that}} they violated NCAA regulations regarding receiving extra compensation. It was later determined Bomar received $7,406.88 and Quinn $8,137.17. The loss of these <b>two</b> <b>key</b> players affected the team's placement in many publications' preseason polls {{as well as their}} chances of winning a national championship. The team turned to starting quarterback Paul Thompson (a converted wide receiver in 2005) and backup Joey Halzle to lead the team.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus uses <b>two</b> <b>key</b> {{mechanisms}} {{to evade the}} immune system. First, {{it is capable of}} surviving the highly acidic conditions of the stomach, allowing the virus to infect the host and spread throughout the body via the lymphatic system. Second, because it can replicate very quickly, the virus overwhelms the host organs before an immune response can be mounted. If detail is given at the attachment phase; poliovirus with canyons on the virion surface have virus attachment sites located in pockets at the canyon bases. The canyons are too narrow for access by antibodies, so the virus attachment sites are protected from the host’s immune surveillance, while the remainder of the virion surface can mutate to avoid the host’s immune response.|$|E
5|$|Several causes {{provoked}} a dramatic population decrease over time: on one hand, commercial hunting (especially during the Roman Empire and Middle Ages) and, during the 20th century, eradication by fishermen, {{who used to}} consider it a pest due to the damage the seal causes to fishing nets when it preys on fish caught in them; and, on the other hand, coastal urbanization and pollution. Currently, its entire population {{is estimated to be}} less than 600 individuals scattered throughout a wide distribution range, which qualifies this species as endangered. Its current very sparse population is one more serious threat to the species, as it only has <b>two</b> <b>key</b> sites that can be deemed viable. One is the Aegean Sea (250–300 animals in Greece, with the largest concentration of animals in Gyaros island, and some 100 in Turkey); the other important subpopulation is the Western Saharan portion of Cabo Blanco (around 200 individuals which may support the small, but growing, nucleus in the Desertas Islands – approximately 20 individuals). There may be some individuals using coastal areas among other parts of Western Sahara, such as in Cintra Bay. These <b>two</b> <b>key</b> sites are virtually in the extreme opposites of the species' distribution range, which makes natural population interchange between them impossible. All the other remaining subpopulations are composed of less than 50 mature individuals, many of them being only loose groups of extremely reduced size – often less than five individuals. Consequently, there is low genetic variability.|$|E
