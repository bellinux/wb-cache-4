40|$|Survey of {{the open}} {{pollination}} by isozymes in a wild rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) seeds orchard. The Côte dʼIvoire has a wild rubber tree population for which an improvement in a seeds orchard is suggested by open pollination. The isozymes markers (5 loci) were applied to study the open pollination in a rubber <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> in 1998 and 1999. The results confirmed the allogamic character of the rubber tree. On {{the period of the}} survey (1998 and 1999), the outcrossing rate estimated to 0. 97 and 0. 96 varies weakly between the two years. The high level of the outcrossing rate show that pollinations are realized between trees of different genotypes. The fixation index (FIS) decrease from the parental population to the descendantʼs one where it is not significantly different from zero. So crossings are panmictics, and the fertilizations between the related trees are practically inexistent. The rate of self-fertilization is mostly due to the real self-fertilizations between the ovuls and the pollen coming from the same origin. Thus, considering the results, the pollination in the seeds orchard would be favorable to the realization of substantial genetic progress in the wild rubber trees population...|$|E

40|$|The Scots pine <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> Västerhus is a <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> in the 2 nd {{round of}} {{orchards}} in Sweden, {{but since the}} clones were selected after progeny testing, it is genetically comparable to the 3 rd round of <b>seed</b> <b>orchards.</b> It contains 28 clones which were selected from clones used in six plus <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> and used in different numbers. The clonal selections and deployed clonal proportions were worked out by Dag Lindgren and Bengt Andersson {{in an attempt to}} apply advanced designs in an operational orchard. The gain should then be increased while constrains would be kept on the genetic variation, a strategy later named linear deployment. In this deployment, the strategy was that the clones with the highest breeding values should be represented in higher numbers. In addition, flowering capacity was considered to predict gene contribution from each clone for the clonal deployment. The <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> was established 1991. In the summer 2007 16. 1 % of the grafts were dead and for 0. 9 % of the grafts, the root stock had replaced the grafted clone. The gain in breeding value by the linear deployment was initially estimated to 5. 7 - 6. 2 % as compared to a comparable hypothetical <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> with equal clonal representation. The estimated gain by linear deployment at establishment did not change much due to loss of grafts. It is assumed that in this young <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> pollen contamination from the surrounding stands may have a larger and reducing effect on the genetic gain than loss of grafts and thus changed clone proportions...|$|R
40|$|Information about {{fertility}} {{variation of}} flowering <b>trees</b> in <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> including determining {{the quality of}} seed production and estimating the genetic diversity are still lacking. This paper evaluates fertility variation, effective population size and genetic diversity among cajuput <b>trees</b> in seedling <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> at Paliyan, Gunungkidul for optimizing <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> management. A total of 160 trees were observed in three flowering periods of 2011 - 2013. The fertility {{based on the number}} of flowers and fruits were registered for each tree at the age of 12, 13 and 14 years. Results show that there are similar patterns of fertility after three years observation. Sibling coefficients (Ψ) which show fertility variation during three flowering periods are 1. 39, 1. 25 and 1. 43 respectively. They show deviation from random mating, because of individual imbalance for producing flowers and fruits. However, the number of fertile trees was comparatively higher at 2011. More than 15 families of effective population size were recorded each year and supported more than 75 % individuals in <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> to contribute flowers and seeds. High value of genetic diversity was calculated based on fertility variation (0. 965, 0. 967 and 0. 957, respectively). Fertility variation led to consequence on seed deployment, including seeds of fertile families which should be collected equally and mixed to compose equal proportion of seeds and to avoid domination of highly fertility families and genetic drift. Silvicultural treatments in <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> management were indispensable to promote fertility uniformity and to increase effective population size in <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> for obtaining maximal genetic gain...|$|R

Pollen contamination, mating between relatives and an imbalance in gametic contributions affect the efficiency of seed crop quality in <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> on which genetic improvement strategies are based. A set of six microsatellite markers was used to carry out parentage tests on 600 progenies harvested from 30 <b>trees</b> in a <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> and to identify open-pollinated mating designs, progeny pedigrees and a high genetic admixture in the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard.</b> The trial, which was planted with those progenies and monitored from 9 to 37 months revealed substantial inbreeding depression effects on growth traits due to selfing.

40|$|Establishment of <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> {{is aimed}} at {{producing}} good quality seeds which is an important activity for breeding program. <b>Seed</b> <b>orchard</b> is also a base population, thus its genetic diversity is depending on its design and composition (provenance, family and individual tree). Selection of an individual <b>tree</b> in <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> is needed for the enhancement of retaining good-character trees. However, selection of individual tree can change the genetic diversity of <b>seed</b> <b>orchard,</b> and the degrees to which the genetic diversity will change depend on the used selection methods. In order to investigate the effects of selection methods, 4 simulations of selection methods based on height, diameter and stem performance of individual trees were used. The differences among the 4 methods were the ranking of individual trees those selected, and families and provenances those have been represented. Seedling <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> of Acacia mangium in Wonogiri, Central Java was used as materials. Analysis of genetic diversity was carried out using AFLP markers. Nine primer combinations were used to produce 1025 AFLP banding patterns. Among those banding patterns, only 109 were polymorphic markers. No significant effect of individual tree selection was revealed in this study. Even though the selection was done intensively, only 7. 1 % of genetic diversity was reduced. In other words, the selection activity did not reduce the genetic diversity of <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> significantly. The result is important for developing future tree improvement of A. mangium, including development of hybrid between A. mangium and A. auriculiformis...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} way {{to drive}} modifications in old forest <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> {{is to establish}} progeny trials involving each parent tree and then evaluate its contribution {{to the performance of}} the progeny by estimating its general and specific combining ability (GCA and SCA). In this work, we successfully applied an alternative parent selection tactic based on paternity testing of superior offspring derived from a hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> established with a single Eucalyptus grandis seed parents and six E. urophylla pollen parents. A battery of 14 microsatellite markers was used to carry out parentage tests of 256 progeny individuals including two independent samples of selected trees and one control unselected sample, all derived from 6 -year-old forest stands in eastern Brazil. Paternity determination was carried out for all progeny individuals by a sequential paternity exclusion procedure. Exclusion was declared only when the obligatory paternal allele in the progeny tree was not present in the alleged parent tree for at least four independent markers to avoid false exclusions due to mutation or null alleles. After maternity checks to identify seed mixtures and selfed individuals, the paternity tests revealed that approximately 29 % of the offspring was sired by pollen parents outside the orchard. No selfed progeny were found in the selected samples. Three pollen parents were found to have sired essentially all of the offspring in the samples of selected and non-selected progeny individuals. One of these three parents sired significantly more selected progeny than unselected ones (P_ 0. 0002 in a Fisher exact test). Based on these results, low-reproductive-successful parents were culled from the orchard, and management procedures were adopted to minimize external pollen contamination. A significant difference (P< 0. 01) in mean annual increment was observed between forest stands produced with <b>seed</b> from the <b>orchard</b> before and after selection of parents and revitalization of the orchard. An average realized gain of 24. 3 % in volume growth was obtained from the selection of parents as measured in forest stands at age 2 – 4 years. The marker-assisted treebreeding tactic presented herein efficiently identified top parents in a <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> and resulted in an improved seed variety.

40|$|Data {{from three}} <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> (Chongyang, Zhangle and Laoshan) and Lintian forest {{were used to}} study {{pollination}} characteristics, pollination level, pollen and ovule production in Chinese fir. The results show that male and female cones have their own distribution patterns within crowns. Male cones {{are located in the}} middle to top and female cones the middle to bottom part of the crown. Because of lower density of <b>trees</b> in <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> than that in a stand, female cones are distributed over the entire crown in <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> <b>trees.</b> Chinese fir male and female cones appear to be very well adapted for wind as the pollination mechanism. There is no difference in the number of pollen grains produced by one pollen sac among trees in the same clone, but there are differences between clones. There are differences between both clones and years in female cone number, male cone number and their ratio. The pollen accumulation rate during pollination should be 3 to 5 pollen grains/mm 2 to ensure fertilization. The Chinese fir <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> in this study produced too much pollen and could be improved by stimulation of more female flowers in order to produce more seeds.

40|$|The {{island of}} St Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean has a rich endemic flora, with 10 endemic genera and 45 {{recognised}} endemic species. However, populations of most endemic species have undergone dramatic reductions or extinction due to over-exploitation, habitat destruction and competition from invasive species. Consequently, endemic species {{are likely to}} have lost genetic variation, in some cases to extreme degrees. Here, the entire extant wild populations and all planted <b>trees</b> in <b>seed</b> <b>orchards,</b> of two critically endangered species in the endemic genus Commidendrum (Asteraceae), C. rotundifolium and C. spurium, were sampled to assess levels of genetic variation and inbreeding. Six new microsatellite loci were developed from next-generation sequence data, and a total of 190 samples were genotyped. Some <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> <b>trees</b> contained alleles from both wild C. rotundifolium and C. spurium indicating they could be hybrids and that some backcrossing may have occurred. Some of these trees were more similar to C. rotundifolium than C. spurium both genetically and morphologically. Importantly, allelic variation was detected in the putative hybrids that was not present in wild material. C. rotundifolium is represented by just two individuals one wild and one planted and C. spurium by seven, therefore the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> <b>trees</b> comprise {{an important part of the}} total remaining genetic diversity in the genus Commidendrum...|$|R
30|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>orchards</b> {{are usually}} {{established}} to supply genetically improved material for breeding individuals {{that have been}} selected for their phenotypes. However, seed obtained from these orchards can be considered better than seed from unimproved populations only if the crossing between superior <b>trees</b> within the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> is efficacious, that is, if seed production from breeding represents an ideal situation in which all clones contribute equally to generation of seeds. According to this study, equal contribution of all clones to the seed produced does not occur. Instead, seedling progeny represent only {{a small proportion of}} possible crosses within <b>seed</b> <b>orchard.</b> This is very far from the ideal of panmixia. It is likely due to phenological differences and other types of incompatibilities among individuals.

Several behaviors were observed: a). the best trees in MLT dominantly originated from singlepair trees, between maternal and paternal trees, in F 1 SSO; b). a maternal tree was pollinated by two paternal trees; c). a paternal tree pollinated several maternal trees. Flowering synchronization and genetic compatibility among trees might be responsible for these mating system patterns.

A tree improvement programme has been ongoing at the Institute for Commercial Forestry Research for two decades, but genetic improvement in the species has been slow due to delayed and infrequent flowering and seed production. Three trials were established, firstly, to quantify the gains {{that have been made}} in the first generation of improvement in the breeding programme and, secondly, to establish whether a number of <b>seed</b> source and <b>orchard</b> variables influence the performance of the progeny. These variables were the amount of flowering <b>trees</b> in the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard,</b> year of <b>seed</b> collection, <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> origin and composition of <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> bulks.

Field data were compared to the climatic conditions at natural and commercial provenances of seven Mesoamerican Pinus species identified as possible hybrid partners. In vitro pollen studies were used to confirm whether interspecific crosses with P. radiata might be feasible within predefined climatic parameters. The temperature ranges for both top and northern side of P. radiata pine <b>trees</b> in the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> was similar to the natural distribution of P. radiata, P. elliottii Engelm. and P. taeda L. in the USA. Results suggested that pollen of P. elliottii and P. taeda might be more suited to result in the successful pollination of P. radiata than the other Mesoamerican pine species tested in this study.  Furthermore, the combination of minimum temperature and precipitation also showed a closer correlation to successful hybridisation with P. radiata for both P. elliotii and P. taeda. However, pollen tube elongation studies did not support these results, suggesting that mean temperature might not be the only determining factor of hybridisation success. Three circadian temperature models that mimic natural conditions were developed for Karatara and Sabie (Tweefontein, Witklip and Spitskop).  These models will be tested in future in vitro studies to further evaluate temperature fluctuations between day and night regimes as a possible reproductive barrier limiting hybridisation success between P. radiata and other Mesoamerican pine species...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: It is {{more than}} 20 years, since we started to study flower {{characteristics}} and the mating system in the <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> of Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. A number of papers {{have been published in}} Chinese journals. Some results concerning variation of mating system parameters, pollen contamination and pollen dispersal with enzyme and SSR analysis are summarized in this paper. Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. is an important tree species for Northern China due to its extensive distribution, tolerance in harsh sites, rather fast growth and high wood quality. Seed crops in <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> are stable, if insects are controlled. The high genetic quality and ample yield of seeds in the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> is closely related with the mating pattern of <b>seed</b> <b>orchards.</b> In order to make a clear picture of the temporal and spatial change in the mating system parameters, namely outcrossing, inbreeding, selfing and contamination rates in the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard,</b> as well as pollen dispersal distance, field observation of flower characteristics with laboratory analysis was continuously carried out more than 20 years (Shen X. H. et al., 1985; Wang X. R. et al., 1991). Some results with enzyme and SSR analysis are shown in this paper.

40|$|Pollen pattern {{dispersal}} in seedling <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> (SSO) is {{an essential}} part of a tree-improvement program. Two SSOs of Acacia mangium in South Kalimantan and South Sumatra that represent similar resources in different environments were used in this study.   Genotypes of all <b>trees</b> and <b>seeds</b> from a subset of 10 mother trees in each orchard were determined for 12 microsatellite loci, and parentage analysis was carried out. The results shows that the pollen dispersal pattern in both SSOs decrease with distance from mother tree. Patterns of pollen dispersal, dispersal distance and cumulative frequency of pollen dispersal distance were similar in both SSOs. Random pollen dispersal were found in both SSOs. About 80 % of all crosses were found within a 40 -m distance range with the most frequent pollination distance between mother tree and male male parents was 0 - 10 m. No self-pollinated seed was detected. Application of all these aspects found in this study such as random pollen dispersal and the effective pollen dispersal distance can be useful for establishing seedling <b>seed</b> <b>orchard,</b> clonal <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> and in other tree improvement activities of A. mangium...|$|R

It {{is determined by the}} variation of male and female gametic contributions of parental genotypes (including those outside the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard),</b> influenced by the variation in male and female gamete production, reproductive phenology, pollen dispersal within <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> and other factors. We assessed male and female fecundity, as well as temporal course of male and female flowering in two <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> of Pinus nigra ARNOLD and Fraxinus excelsior L. /F. angustifolia VAHL. in Slovakia. In both cases, male and female gametic contributions of plus-tree clones were modeled on the basis of fecundity and flowering phenology, and were used to calculate status number as an estimator of effective {{population size}}. In the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> of Pinus nigra, marker-aided verification of clonal fidelity revealed unexpectedly high proportion of misplaced ramets (29. 9 %) and alien genotypes (44. 4 %). Monitoring of reproductive processes in 2002 and 2003 showed high variation in both male and female fecundity, and pollen shedding preceding female receptivity in Pinus nigra. All these factors contributed to a very low relative status effective number, representing 8. 6 % to 38. 6 % of the population census (depending from the management option in relation to misplaced and alien genotypes). In the mixed <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> of Fraxinus excelsior and F. angustifolia, the proportion of misplaced and alien genotypes was much lower (22. 4 % and 12. 3 %, respectively). However, a high fecundity variation and protogyny resulted in a low relative status number (18. 8 % to 29. 5 % of the census number of clones) also in this <b>seed</b> <b>orchard.</b> Practical implications of these findings are shortly discussed and practical management options are proposed...|$|R
