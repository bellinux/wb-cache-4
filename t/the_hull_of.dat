5|$|In the {{drafts of}} the Alien Resurrection screenplay, writer Joss Whedon {{included}} a death {{scene in which}} a lifeform was sucked through a gap in <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> a ship. In the second draft, Perez was sucked through a fist-sized breach in <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the Auriga; this was changed in the final version to the Newborn being sucked {{through the window of}} the Betty. 20th Century Fox executives were skeptical about the final version, seeing it as a comedic scene contrasting with the overall tone of the Alien franchise, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet persuaded them to leave the scene in.|$|E

5|$|As {{the wave}} {{breaches}} the Himalayas and approaches the site, an impact driver lodges in the ark-door gears, keeping a boarding gate open and preventing the ship's engines from starting. In the ensuing chaos where many people attempt {{to board the}} ships, Yuri, Tamara and Gordon are killed, Tenzin is injured, Ark 4 begins filling with water and is set adrift after Air Force One crashes into one of its supports, while also causing it to skim <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> Ark 6 before drifting off. With Jackson and Noah's help, {{the crew of the}} Ark manages to regain control of the Ark narrowly before it fatally smashes into Mount Everest.|$|E

5|$|At about 06:00 on 9 October 1913, , a Royal Line ship under {{charter to}} the Uranium Line, caught {{fire in a}} gale on the North Atlantic. The crew fought the fire for about two hours, but, realizing the {{severity}} of the fire and the limited options for dousing it in the high seas, Captain Francis Inch of Volturno had his wireless operator send out SOS signals. The westbound Kroonland, already beyond Volturnos location, turned east to aid the burning liner. In the meantime, several of Volturnos lifeboats with women and children aboard were launched with tragic results: all those aboard the lifeboats were killed as the boats capsized or were smashed by <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the heaving ship.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{continues}} his mission in Jamaica, where he meets a local fisherman, Quarrel, and John Strangways, {{the head of}} the local MI6 station. Quarrel gives Bond training in scuba diving in the local waters. Bond swims through shark- and barracuda-infested waters to Mr Big's island and manages to plant a limpet mine on <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> his yacht before being captured once again by Mr Big. Bond is reunited with Solitaire; the following morning Mr Big ties the couple to a line behind his yacht and plans to drag them over the shallow coral reef and into deeper water so that the sharks and barracuda that he attracts in to the area with regular feedings will eat them.|$|E
5|$|Limitations {{imposed by}} the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty {{prevented}} the class from being completed as designed. However, the treaty had a limited allowance for hulls already under construction to be converted into aircraft carriers. Amagi and Akagi were both intended for conversion, but an earthquake damaged <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> Amagi so extensively that the ship was scrapped. Akagi was reconstructed as an aircraft carrier and served with distinction {{as part of the}} Kido Butai during the Second World War, participating in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor before being sunk at the Battle of Midway.|$|E

5|$|No pre-dreadnoughts served postWorld War II as armed ships; {{the last}} serving pre-dreadnought was the former SMS Hessen, {{which was used}} as a target ship by the Soviet union into the early 1960s as the Tsel. <b>The</b> <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the former USS Kearsarge (BB-5) served as a crane ship from 1920 until its {{scrapping}} in 1955. The hulk of the ex-USS Oregon (BB-3) {{was used as a}}n ammunition barge at Guam until 1948, after which she was scrapped in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, a 30,000ton freighter, the MV Korean Star, {{sustained}} extreme damage {{during the}} storm. Rough seas caused <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> {{the ship to}} break and the vessel was separated into two pieces. Although the freighter was in two pieces, the ship did not sink and the wreckage of it came ashore near Cape Cuvier. No one on the ship sustained injury as all 19 crew members abandoned ship. The crew was rescued within a day of sustaining the damage and flown to Carnarvon.|$|E
5|$|The Nichols Bridgeway, a {{pedestrian}} bridge that opened on May 16, 2009, connects {{the south end}} of Millennium Park with the Modern Wing of the Art Institute of Chicago. The bridge begins at the southwest end of the Jay Pritzker Pavilion's Great Lawn and extends across Monroe Street, where it connects to {{the third floor of the}} Art Institute's West Pavilion.

50|$|A. amphitrite {{is part of}} the {{biofouling}} community. The larvae settle out on and colonise <b>the</b> <b>hulls</b> <b>of</b> ships, harbour structures, buoys and the inflow pipes of desalination plants. These become {{covered with}} barnacles and other associated hard fouling species. Metal structures become corroded and maintenance costs are increased. The fouling also causes friction between the water and <b>the</b> <b>hulls</b> <b>of</b> ships and this reduces efficiency and increases fuel costs.|$|R

5|$|All four {{ships were}} officially laid down on 19 December 1912, but work {{did not begin}} until March–April 1913. After a {{progress}} review on 4 June 1914, launching of the first pair of ships was delayed until October 1914. When World War I began, <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> Izmail, the most advanced ship, was judged 43percent complete, with the others lagging considerably behind. The war caused more delays, including problems obtaining imported components, and the ships were competing for scarce resources with other production deemed necessary for the war. Three of the four ships were launched in 1915, {{but it was clear}} that Russian industry {{would not be able to}} complete them during the war, mostly because the turrets were seriously delayed. They were reclassified as 2nd rank projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916.|$|E
5|$|Arguably the {{greatest}} weakness of these ships lay in {{their inability to}} generate sufficient electric current to power the multitude of auxiliary motors on which their advanced machinery and complex gun mountings were dependent. Their DC electrical supply was only 115V, whereas larger cruisers with power-operated turrets had a 230V system. Electrical power was generated by two Alsthom turbo-generators rated at only 120kW with two small diesel generators rated at 44/52kW for use when the ship was alongside. The latter provided only for the ship's minimum lighting and electricity needs, and fires had to be lit {{in at least one}} of the boilers in order to train the turrets or elevate the guns for practice or maintenance. Many of the auxiliary motors themselves were also seriously underpowered, particularly the servomotors for the gun mountings (which were slow to train and elevate) and for the rudder which contributed to the ship's poor maneuverability. In technological terms Mogador and Volta were ships with the armament of a light cruiser in <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> a destroyer; the contre-torpilleur as a type had been pushed past the limits of its capabilities.|$|E
5|$|At 18:00, {{with the}} rest of the pursuit far behind, Paulet succeeded in {{bringing}} Gloire within range of the cannon on his ship's quarterdeck. Opening fire with these guns brought a response from Beens' sternchaser guns, the frigates exchanging cannon shot for four and a half hours as Astraea slowly caught up with its elusive opponent. At 22:30, Paulet was finally close enough to lay Astraea alongside Gloire and the two frigates exchanged fire at close range for the next 58 minutes, Paulet concentrating his gunnery on <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the French ship while Beens' ordered his men to disable the British ship's rigging and masts. Gloire was a substantially larger ship than Astraea, both in weight of shot and gross tonnage, and the battle was fiercely contested: Beens suffered a head injury and all three of Astraeas topmasts taking serious damage, so much so that the main topmast collapsed in the aftermath of the action. However at 23:28, with two British ships of the line visible in the distance, Beens surrendered his ship to Paulet.|$|E

5|$|Before the launch, Metroplex sacrifices {{himself by}} {{transferring}} {{all of his}} Energon to the Ark. Optimus then calls for the launch to try and escape through the portal before it closes, but the Decepticons arrive in the Nemesis to stop them. Soundwave leads {{the first wave of}} troops onto the ship through giant cables and destroys the Arks automated defense system. Optimus sends Jetfire into space to disengage the cables. Bruticus launches from the Nemesis and destroys the Arks fuel line before being fatally injured and blasted off the ship into empty space by Jazz and Jetfire. Nearby, Bumblebee takes the fatal hit for Optimus and the two rival leaders engage in a battle to death. Depending on the players choice to play as either Optimus or Megatron, one manages to defeat the other and deal a fatal blow. But before the final blow can be dealt, both Optimus and Megatron are pulled off of <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the Ark and into the portal with both ships.

5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{launched}} in late 1921, {{but the first}} ship, , was cancelled {{in accordance with the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty before it could be completed, and was used in experiments testing the effectiveness of its armor scheme before being scuttled in the Bungo Channel. <b>The</b> <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the second ship, , was converted into an aircraft carrier of the same name. The carrier supported Japanese troops in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War of the late 1930s, and took part in the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month her aircraft participated in a combined carrier airstrike on Darwin, Australia, during the Dutch East Indies campaign. She was sunk during the Battle of Midway in 1942.|$|E
