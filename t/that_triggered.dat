Numerous roads sustained damage, separating communities from surrounding areas. At least 18 {{people were killed}} and 32 others were injured by the storm. Additionally, an estimated 173,000 people were affected across the country.|$|E
5|$|As the {{precursor}} to Sandra traversed Central America, it produced unseasonably heavy rainfall <b>that</b> <b>triggered</b> flooding and landslides. Four {{people died in}} various incidents related to the system: three in El Salvador and one in Honduras. Initially expecting a landfalling storm, officials in Northwestern Mexico prepared equipment for power outages, closed schools, and evacuated 180residents. Sandra's effects largely consisted of light to moderate rainfall; some traffic accidents and landslides resulted from this, though the overall impacts were limited.|$|E
5|$|Crawford {{announced}} {{his plans for}} a sequel, Frog Fractions 2, via a Kickstarter campaign in March 2014, with a planned release in 2015. The campaign included a number of elements that pointed players towards a larger alternate reality game (ARG) that incorporated a number of web sites, social media accounts, real-life locations, and around two dozen independent video games. The ARG was solved by players around December 2016, discovering a physical box <b>that</b> <b>triggered</b> the release of Frog Fractions 2, hidden within {{the content of the}} video game Glittermitten Grove.|$|E

The two storms contributed to heavy rainfall <b>that</b> <b>triggered</b> floods and landslides, which closed roads and highways. High waves killed three people after a boat overturned. The storm destroyed 566houses and damaged another2,363. A total of 31,813people evacuated to 184government-opened shelters. Officials canceled classes during the system; several schools were used as temporary shelters. Damage totaled over $1.5million (₱64million pesos), and the floods killed 58people.|$|E

5|$|In January 2002, Mustaine {{was hospitalized}} {{for the removal}} of a kidney stone and was {{administered}} pain medication <b>that</b> <b>triggered</b> a relapse of his drug addiction. Following his stay, Mustaine checked himself into a treatment center in Texas, where he suffered a peculiar injury causing severe nerve damage to his left arm. The injury, induced by falling asleep with his left arm over the back of a chair, caused compression of the radial nerve. He was diagnosed with radial neuropathy, which left him unable to grasp or even make a fist with his left hand.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the center}} of the storm {{remained}} offshore, outer rainbands led to heavy rainfall <b>that</b> <b>triggered</b> substantial flooding. In Michoacán, Dalila flooded ten municipalities with at least 15in (380mm) of precipitation, destroying dozens of wooden structures. Heavy rains in Jalisco killed eleven, many of whom occurred in automobile crashes. Flood waters covered numerous roads, causing many accidents, while approximately 50 homes were damaged. Rough seas and heavy rain affected Baja California Sur, though no damage or fatalities were reported.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev has {{fared well}} in opinion polls when {{compared}} to his successors and predecessors in Russia. In the West he is most commonly remembered for starting the economic stagnation <b>that</b> <b>triggered</b> {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union. In an opinion poll by VTsIOM in 2007 the majority of Russians chose to live during the Brezhnev era rather than any other period of 20th century Soviet history. In a Levada Center poll conducted in 2013, Brezhnev beat Vladimir Lenin as Russia's favourite leader in the 20th century with 56% approval. In another poll in 2013, Brezhnev was voted the best Russian leader of the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Kieftenbeld {{was twice}} shortlisted for the Eredivisie's annual Maatschappelijk Speler (Community Player) award, which {{brings with it}} a €50,000 prize to be donated to a social project of the winner's choice. He was {{actively}} involved with Kids United, a football team for children with disabilities. Although he did not win on either occasion, his charity still benefited when the 2015 winner, Jeroen Zoet, shared the prize money {{with the other two}} nominees. In late July 2015, English club Birmingham City made a bid for Kieftenbeld's services <b>that</b> <b>triggered</b> the release clause in his contract. Although Groningen accepted they could not stop him leaving, they were disappointed not just at losing their captain so soon {{before the start of the}} new season, but at losing a player who did so much for the club in the community.|$|E
5|$|On August 18, a {{tropical}} depression formed {{south of the}} Gulf of Tehuantepec from {{a tropical}} wave that had entered the Pacific Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean. It strengthened into a tropical storm later that day. The tropical storm moved westward, and became a hurricane on August 21. Ilsa became a Category 2 hurricane on August 22. It maintained that intensity for three days as it moved out to sea. On August 25, Ilsa turned westward and rapidly weakened. It fell to tropical storm intensity on August 26. Later that day, while still maintaining winds of gale-force, Ilsa ceased being a tropical cyclone. Ilsa's remnants continued out over the open Pacific Ocean. The remains of Ilsa eventually interacted with another weather system. <b>That</b> <b>triggered</b> {{the development of the}} unnamed hurricane of August 31–September 5.|$|E
5|$|The 1974 {{series in}} the West Indies was of five Tests. The West Indian team were {{regarded}} as the better side, and for them to only draw the series was a surprise. After they won the first Test it had seemed that the series would become a one-sided contest. This Test was notable for a controversial Alvin Kallicharran run out <b>that</b> <b>triggered</b> protests. England managed to secure draws {{in the next three}} Tests, thanks to Dennis Amiss' 262 in the second Test and Keith Fletcher's 129 in the third, while rain prevented a result in the fourth Test. The last match at Queen's Park Oval was a close game, with England winning by 26 runs, primarily due to Tony Greig taking 13 wickets bowling off-spin and Boycott scoring 212 runs in the match. England thereby levelled the series, which finished 1–1.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of globular clusters remains a poorly understood phenomenon {{and it remains}} uncertain whether the stars in a globular cluster form in a single generation or are spawned across multiple generations {{over a period of}} several hundred million years. In many globular clusters, most of the stars are at approximately the same stage in stellar evolution, suggesting that they formed at about the same time. However, the star formation history varies from cluster to cluster, with some clusters showing distinct populations of stars. An example of this is the globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that exhibit a bimodal population. During their youth, these LMC clusters may have encountered giant molecular clouds <b>that</b> <b>triggered</b> a second round of star formation. This star-forming period is relatively brief, compared to the age of many globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{was able}} to further open up a twenty-two second lead {{over the rest of}} the field and {{maintained}} it for the remainder of the race to secure the victory. Ceccon finished one with one second covering Evans in third and Nasr in fourth; Evans narrowly fended off Nasr for the final podium place. Calado secured fifth with Coletti taking sixth and Binder seventh. Quaife-Hobbs passed Richemi for eighth place in the final stages of the race and thus earned the sprint race pole position. Richelmi and De Jong rounded out the top-ten points-scoring positions. Dillmann, Lancaster, Trummer, Rosenzweig and Canamasas took the next five places and Abt was the last of the classified finishers. It was Bird's third win in the GP2 Series, his (and Russian Time's) second of the season, and his first victory at the circuit since his 2012 Formula Renault 3.5 Series Monaco round triumph. After the race, the stewards deemed Cecotto responsible for causing the first lap accident <b>that</b> <b>triggered</b> the race's sole stoppage and Cecotto was barred from competing in the following day's sprint event.|$|E
5|$|In June 2004, Fletcher's {{aircraft}} {{caused a}} security scare <b>that</b> <b>triggered</b> a brief evacuation of the U.S. Capitol and Supreme Court building. Shortly after takeoff {{en route to}} memorial services for former president Ronald Reagan, the transponder on Fletcher's plane malfunctioned, leading officials at Reagan National Airport to report an unauthorized aircraft entering restricted airspace. Two F-15 fighters were dispatched to investigate, and Fletcher's plane was escorted to its destination by two Blackhawk helicopters. The plane, a 33-year-old Beechcraft King Air, was the oldest of its model still in operation. An investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) found that the crew of Fletcher's plane maintained radio contact with air traffic officials and received clearance to enter the restricted air space. The investigation determined that miscommunication by air traffic controllers sparked the panic, and {{in the aftermath of}} the incident, the FAA adopted policies to prevent future errors of a similar nature.|$|E

5|$|The French Democracy {{begins with}} a re-enactment of the real-life 27 October 2005 event <b>that</b> <b>triggered</b> riots in France: the {{electrocution}} of two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré. In the film, the youths attempt to hide from police in a building near an electric power station. In a televised speech, the Minister of the Interior vows to increase efforts to fight crime. Three fictional Moroccan men discuss the recent events and disagree with means used by the police, and feel that blacks are unfairly targeted. They face different forms of discrimination: overnight detention {{for lack of a}} passport during an identity check, refusal of employment and housing rental, and police brutality. Angered, the three riot using Molotov cocktails. A white family watches television coverage of the chaos, and the film ends with a dedication to Benna and Traoré, lamenting the loss of the French ideals of freedom, equality, and fraternity.|$|E
