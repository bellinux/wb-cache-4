While {{it is assumed that}} matters relating directly to status and <b>capacity,</b> <b>testamentary</b> dispositions, and title to immovable property fall outside the jurisdictional reach of international arbitrators, the question becomes whether any national regulatory laws, such as tax laws, benefit from the same status of inviolability...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} better and more {{accurate}} assessments of <b>testamentary</b> and decision-making <b>capacity</b> grows as Australian society ages and incidences of mentally disabling conditions increase. Capacity is a legal determination, but one on which medical opinion is increasingly being sought. The difficulties inherent within capacity assessments are exacerbated by the ad hoc approaches adopted by legal and medical professionals based on individual knowledge and skill, {{as well as the}} numerous assessment paradigms that exist. This can negatively affect the quality of assessments, and results in confusion as to the best way to assess capacity. This article begins by assessing the nature of capacity. The most common general assessment models used in Australia are then discussed, as are the practical challenges associated with capacity assessment. The article concludes by suggesting a way forward to satisfactorily assess legal capacity given the significant ramifications of getting it wrong...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Testamentary</b> {{capacity}}Testamentary <b>capacity</b> is {{the mental}} capacity {{required to make}} a valid will. The current test comes from the decision in Banks v Goodfellow (1870).8 [...] This case concerned {{the validity of the}} will of John Banks. In modern terms he would most likely be described as a paranoid schizophrenic. He suffered from delusions that he was being persecuted by devils (they were sometimes visible to him) and also by a deceased local grocer. His will was challenged on the basis that he was insane and therefore unable to make a will.9 [...] The will was found to be valid after trial by jury, before Brett J, at Cumberland Spring Assizes in 1869. On appeal, this judgment was confirmed unanimously by a panel of four appeal judges in Queen’s Bench. The will was found to be valid, not influenced by his delusions, and deemed rational, being in favour of his only close relative (who also lived with him). In a strong and eloquent judgment, Cockburn CJ set out the following test of the capacity to make a valid will, which still applied in many Anglophone jurisdictions today:“It is essential to the exercise of such a power that a testator shall understand the nature of the act and its effects; shall understand the extent of the property of which he is disposing; shall be able to comprehend and appreciate the claims to which he ought to give effect; and, with a view to the latter object, that no disorder of the mind shall poison his affections, pervert his sense of right, or prevent the exercise of his natural faculties—that no insane delusion shall influence his will in disposing of his property and bring about a disposal of it which, if the mind had been sound, would not have been made.” 10 [...] This remains the test today, notwithstanding the Mental Capacity Act 2005.11It is now considered as being composed of four distinct elements and that understanding is required of1 the nature of the act of making a will and its effect2 the extent of the property that is to be disposed of3 the claims of family or friendship to which he ought to give effectand as a separate element12 [...] 4 that no disorder of the mind shall poison his affections, pervert his sense of right, or prevent the exercise of his natural faculties—that no insane delusion shall influence his will in disposing of his property and bring about a disposal of it which, if the mind had been sound, would not have been made.In addition, the original wording, 1, 2 and 3 are all approached as not requiring actual understanding, but instead being capable of understanding [...]13As this is a common law test created by judges, it is capable of being modified by judges, as they see fit in the light of modern circumstances. Modern psychiatric knowledge has allowed the test to be developed by having a further element added and that is for the testator to be capable of exercising his decision-making powers.14 This test is focussed on the ability of the particular individual and his particular estate. The outcome is always unique to the particular facts. Where the circumstances and assets of a testator are simple or straightforward the level of capacity required will be lower than that for the testator with complex circumstances and assets.15 ...|$|R
50|$|The Master of the High Court {{will accept}} without {{evidence}} that the will that he receives from the executor was executed with the necessary <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity.</b> The issue of a testator’s <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> will only arise if someone approaches a court with an application regarding {{the capacity of the}} testator to make a will. The Master determines only whether the formal requirements of the will have been met; he does not concern himself with the other formalities regarding capacity.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> from the testator’s free expression of his will (volition) {{as well as from}} freedom of testation.|$|E
5000|$|Along with resolving an examinee's <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity,</b> a {{forensic}} specialist observes {{for signs of}} undue influence by a concerned party that exploits an emotionally vulnerable individual who might otherwise be cognitively intact. The <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> matter is most frequently raised posthumously, when an aggrieved heir contests the will entered into probate. For this reason, the forensic psychiatrist or forensic psychologist studies the testatrix’ cognition through videotape record of the drafting of the will, or by reviewing email, letters and other records.|$|E
50|$|Under {{a system}} of {{customary}} law, people have freedom of testation just like anyone else and also need {{to comply with the}} requirements of <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{presumption}} of sanity. A person who faces criminal trial is presumed sane until {{the opposite is}} proved. Similarly, a person is presumed to have <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> until {{there is evidence to}} undermine that presumption.|$|E
50|$|Lawyers {{for people}} whose <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> {{might be called}} into {{question}} often arrange for a will execution to be video taped. On video, they ask the testator about his property and about his family, and go over {{the contents of the}} testator's will.|$|E
50|$|The Presumption of Sanity {{is a legal}} legal presumption. Its {{effect is}} {{that a person who}} faces {{criminal}} trial is presumed sane until the opposite is proved. Similarly, a person is presumed to have <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> until there is evidence to undermine that presumption.|$|E
50|$|In {{the common}} law tradition, <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> is the legal term of art used to {{describe}} a person's legal and mental ability to make or alter a valid will. This concept has also been called sound mind and memory or disposing mind and memory.|$|E
5000|$|Lack of {{disposing}} {{mind and}} memory or <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> claims {{are based on}} assertions that the testator lacked mental capacity when the will was drafted, {{and they are the}} most common types of testamentary challenges. <b>Testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> in the United States typically requires that a testator has sufficient mental acuity to understand the amount {{and the nature of the}} property, the family members and the loved ones who would ordinarily receive such property by the will, and (c) how the will disposes of such property. It is a very low standard, and one may possess <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> but still lack mental capacity to sign other contracts. Other nations like Germany may have more stringent requirements for writing a will. Lack of mental capacity or incompetence is typically proven by medical records, irrational conduct of the decedent, and the testimony of those who observed the decedent at the time the will was executed. Simply because an individual has a form of mental illness or disease, undergoes mental health treatment after repeated suicide attempts, or exhibits eccentric behavior, does not mean the person automatically lacks the requisite mental capacity to make a will. Furthermore, a testator with serious dementia may have [...] "lucid periods" [...] and then is capable of writing or modifying a will.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} make a will, the {{testator}} must have <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity.</b> If he does not have such capacity at the time the will is executed—that is to say, at the time it is signed—the will is void ab initio, and thus is deemed to never have been valid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Testamentary</b> <b>{{capacity}},</b> then, {{refers to}} the minimum age and the mental capacity required to make a valid will. The burden of proof in this regard rests on the party alleging formal incapacity. Evidence concerning a testator’s mental capabilities is taken into account when determining the validity of a will.|$|E
5000|$|The {{requirements}} for <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> are minimal. Some courts {{have held that}} a person who lacked the capacity to make a contract can nevertheless make a valid will. While the wording of statutes or judicial rulings will vary from one jurisdiction to another, the test generally requires that the testator was aware of: ...|$|E
5000|$|Those who contest a {{will for}} lack of <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> must {{typically}} show that the decedent suffered from mental unsoundness that left them unable to remember family members or caused them to hold insane delusions about them. [...] Dead Man's Statutes sometimes restrict evidence which can be admitted concerning transactions with the decedent.|$|E
50|$|Certain people, such as minors, {{are usually}} {{deemed to be}} {{conclusively}} incapable of making a will by the common law; however, minors who {{serve in the military}} are conceded the right to make a will by statute in many jurisdictions. In South Africa, however, one acquires <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> at the age of 16 years.|$|E
5000|$|Even when a {{testator}} {{are found}} to have lacked <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> due to senility, loss of memory due to the aging process, infirmity or insanity, courts will sometimes rule that the testator had a [...] "temporary period of lucidity" [...] or a [...] "lucid moment" [...] {{at the time of}} the execution of the testamentary instrument. Such finding will validate a will that would otherwise be denied probate.|$|E
50|$|The whole {{property}} of the testator could not be alienated. The rights of heirs and descendants were protected by enactments which secured to them a legal minimum, the querela inofficiosi testamenti being the remedy of those passed over. The age at which <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> began was fourteen {{in the case of}} males, twelve in the case of females. Up to 439 A.D. a will must have been in Latin; after that date Greek was allowed.|$|E
50|$|Maryland and New York {{recognize}} holographic wills only if made {{by members}} of the Armed Forces. In both states any such will is void one year after that member's discharge from service “unless the testator … does not then possess testamentary capacity” under Maryland law (Md. Estates and Trusts Code Ann. § 4-103(b) (2013)) and for one year after the testator regains <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> under New York law (NY Est Pow & Trusts L § 3-2.2(d) (2012)).|$|E
5000|$|Adults are {{presumed to}} have the ability to make a will. Litigation about <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> {{typically}} revolves around charges that the testator, by virtue of senility, dementia, insanity, or other unsoundness of mind, lacked the mental capacity to make a will. In essence, the doctrine requires those who would challenge a validly executed will to demonstrate that the testator did not know the consequence of his or her conduct when he or she executed the will.|$|E
50|$|A will contest, {{in the law}} of property, is {{a formal}} {{objection}} raised against the validity of a will, based on the contention that the will {{does not reflect the}} actual intent of the testator (the party who made the will) or that the will is otherwise invalid. Will contests generally focus on the assertion that the testator lacked <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity,</b> was operating under an insane delusion, or was subject to undue influence or fraud. A will may be challenged in its entirety or in part.|$|E
5000|$|The {{presumption}} of capacityWhere a will is rational, professionally drawn, seemingly regular {{in form and}} is made by a person whose capacity is not in doubt, there is a presumption that the will is valid. This presumption can be rebutted by a challenger to the will showing {{that there is a}} real doubt about capacity. At this point the burden of proving capacity moves to the propounder of the will to then show that there was <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> at the time the will was executed.7 ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the time}} of Justinian a will founded partly on the jus civile, partly on the edict of the praetor, partly on {{imperial}} constitutions and so called testamentum tripertitum, was generally in use. The main points essential to its validity were that the testator should possess <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity,</b> and that the will should be signed or acknowledged by the testator {{in the presence of}} seven witnesses, or published orally in open court. The witnesses must be idonei, or free from legal disability. For instance, women and slaves were not good witnesses.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{research}} {{finds that}} 0.5-3% of wills are contested. Despite that small percentage, it {{is a substantial}} number, given the millions of American wills probated every year. As of the mid-1980ss, the most common reason for contesting a will is undue influence and/or supposed lack of <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity,</b> accounting for about three quarters of will contests; another 15% of will contests are based on an alleged failure to adhere to required formalities in the disputed will; the remainder of contests involve accusations of fraud, insane delusion, etc.|$|E
50|$|An insane {{delusion}} {{is distinct}} from <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity.</b> A testator might be suffering from an insane delusion but otherwise possess the requisite capacity to make a will. Similarly, an insane delusion {{is distinct from}} a mere mistake. If suffering from an insane delusion, a testator {{is not subject to}} change his or her mind regarding the delusion if presented with contrary evidence, whereas a mistake is capable of being corrected if the testator is told the truth. Additionally, while an insane delusion may cause portions of a will to fail, most courts will not reform or invalidate a will because of a mistake unless it was the result of fraud.|$|E
50|$|Tatham was the {{claimant}} and {{heir to the}} fortune of the deceased. The will, however, had devised {{a portion of the}} property to Wright, a former servant. The main issue was whether the deceased had the required <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> when he wrote his will. Three letters written to the testator were submitted as circumstantial evidence that the author believed the testator was of sound mind and the issue was whether these letters could be admitted as evidence to prove competence or whether they constituted hearsay. Wright had argued that the letters were admissible because they showed that the testator was seen and treated as a competent in the eyes of those who knew him. Tatham argued that they were inadmissible and so would have to sworn under oath before they could be admissible.|$|E
50|$|Driving with {{dementia}} {{could lead to}} severe injury or even death to self and others. Doctors should advise appropriate testing on when to quit driving. The United Kingdom DVLA (Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency) states that people {{with dementia}} who specifically have poor short term memory, disorientation, or lack of insight or judgment are not fit to drive, and in these instances the DVLA must be informed so that the driving licence can be revoked. They do, however, acknowledge low-severity cases and those with an early diagnosis, and those drivers may be permitted to drive pending medical reports. Many support networks are available to people with dementia {{and their families and}} caregivers. Several charitable organisations aim to raise awareness and campaign for the rights of people living with dementia. There is also support and guidance on assessing <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> in people who have dementia.|$|E
50|$|When {{the will}} was offered for probate in Massachusetts, there was {{objection}} by the heirs upon the grounds, among others, {{of lack of}} <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> and undue influence. After a hearing, the probate court granted a motion for the framing of issues for trial before a jury. In that situation, a compromise agreement was entered into between the heirs, the legatees, the devisees, and the executors under the will and the Attorney General of Massachusetts. This agreement provided that the will should be admitted to probate and letters testamentary issued; that the specific and pecuniary bequests to individuals should be enforced; that the bequest of the residuary estate to the Endowment Trust should be disregarded; that $200,000 should {{be paid to the}} heirs, and a like amount to the Endowment Trust, and that the net residue of the estate, as defined, should be equally divided between the trustees of the Endowment Trust and the heirs.|$|E
50|$|Beneficiaries {{and their}} blood {{relations}} {{to the fourth}} degree may not be witnesses. Nuncupative wills are not recognized. Soldiers' and sailors' wills are subject to special rules as in most other countries. Full freedom of testation only exists when the testator has no ascendants or descendants, otherwise the disposable portion of his estate is constrained {{by the rules of}} forced heirship: if the testator has one child he may only dispose of half his estate, if two only one-third, if three or more only one-fourth; if he has no descendants but ascendants in both lines he may dispose of half, if ascendants in one line only he may dispose of three-fourths. The full age of <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> is 21 years, but minors over the age of 16 may dispose by will of half of the estate of which they could dispose had they been of full age. There is no restriction against married women making wills. Will substitutes such as will contracts or a pactum successorium (aka contract concerning succession) are invalid (art. 791 FrCC).|$|E
50|$|In the 21st century, {{eighteen}} is {{the typical}} age of <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity.</b> Full liberty of disposition is not universal. In particular, many states normally grant spouses {{the right to}} {{at least half the}} estate regardless of what the will says (or if no will can be found). Some require that children cannot be disinherited without good cause. In many case, children omitted in a will may still take their share. Louisiana followed French law, by which the testator can under no circumstances alienate by will more than half his property if he leave issue or ascendants. In 1911, the husband's consent was sometimes required for a married woman's will to be valid, but this is no longer the case. Nuncupative and holographic wills are valid in some states, but are forbidden in others. The former are confined to personality and must generally be reduced to writing within a short time after the words are spoken. In Louisiana the mystic or sealed will still existed in 1911. The number of witnesses necessary for the validity of a will of any kind is usually two. Vermont, the last state to require three witnesses, changed its law in 2006. To be valid, witnesses must not be heirs under the will. In 1911, wills of soldiers and sailors were privileged, as in England.|$|E
5000|$|George Meade Easby died on 11 December 2005, {{at the age}} of 87. About a year his death, on 29 June 2004, Easby and Robert Paul Yrigoyen {{signed a}} [...] "Life Partnership Verification Statement". The signing of this {{document}} along with a deed transfer took place at Easby's bedroom inside Baleroy Mansion and without any witnesses or informing anyone. Less than a year later, on 3 March 2005, Easby's 1999 will was altered or modified in a similar way. For the first time it authorized the legal transfer of Easby's entire properties and treasures (including millions of dollars invested in financial institutions and over 100,000 antiques) to Yrigoyen, a man that had been living with Easby since 1995. Easby had always wanted to preserve Baleroy Mansion and the valuable antiques it sheltered. This led to Yrigoyen becoming a suspect of financial crimes, especially since the will was only signed in Easby's bedroom and without any witnesses, as well as the fact that Yrigoyen was engaged in selling Easby's treasure pieces {{for hundreds of thousands of}} dollars, signing Easby's name throughout the years and playing around with Easby's millions of dollars. In December 2006, the Pennsylvania Attorney General filed an appeal from the decree of the Register of Wills granting probate of the 2005 will on the grounds of undue influence and lack of <b>testamentary</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Testamentary</b> <b>capacity</b> is {{generally}} {{governed by the}} law of the testator's domicile {{at the time of his}} death, the form of the instrument in most countries either by the law of his domicile or {{the law of the}} place where the will was made, at his option. The old rule of English law was to allow the former alternative only. The law was altered for the United Kingdom in 1861 by the Wills Act 1861 (known as Lord Kingsdown's Act), by which a will made out of the United Kingdom by a British subject is, as far as regards personal estate, good if made according to the forms required by the law of the place where it was made, or by the law of the testator's domicile at the time of making it, or by the law of the place of his domicile of origin. Subsequent change of domicile does not avoid such a will. Another act passed on the same day, the Domicile Act 1861, enacted that by convention with any foreign government foreign domicile with regard to wills could not be acquired by a testator without a year's residence and a written declaration of intention to become domiciled. By the same act foreign consuls may by convention have certain authority over the wills and property of subjects of foreign states dying in England.|$|E
