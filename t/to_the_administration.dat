5|$|The {{effects of}} excess thyroid hormone {{typically}} respond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of a non-selective beta blocker, such as propranolol (as {{most of the}} symptoms are driven by increased levels of adrenaline {{and its effect on}} the β-adrenergic receptors).

5|$|According to Angela Davis, neutron {{activation}} analysis that was administered after the shootout showed no gunpowder residue on Shakur's fingers and forensic analysis performed at the Trenton, New Jersey crime lab and the FBI crime labs in Washington, D.C. did not find her fingerprints on any weapon at the scene. According to tape recordings and police reports made several hours after the shoot-out, when Harper returned on foot <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> building 200yards (183m) away, he did not report Foerster's presence at the scene; no one at headquarters knew of Foerster's involvement in the shoot-out until his body was discovered beside his patrol car, {{more than an hour}} later.|$|E
5|$|Few {{documents}} {{written in}} either the Khitan large or small script survive to this day.

Only a single manuscript text in the Khitan large script is known (Nova N 176), and no manuscripts in the Khitan small script are known. The Liao emperors could read Chinese, and while there were some Chinese works translated into Khitan during the Liao dynasty, the Confucian classics, which served as the core guide <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of government in China, are not known to have been translated into Khitan.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{ability to}} govern was intimately {{bound up with}} the Church, which formed the key <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of both England and Normandy, and this {{relationship}} changed considerably {{over the course of his}} reign. William the Conqueror had reformed the English Church with the support of his Archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc, who became a close colleague and advisor to the King. Under William Rufus this arrangement had collapsed, the King and Archbishop Anselm had become estranged and Anselm had gone into exile. Henry also believed in Church reform, but on taking power in England he became embroiled in the investiture controversy.|$|E
5|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) is {{the development}} of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant. HIT predisposes to thrombosis (the abnormal formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel) because platelets release microparticles that activate thrombin, thereby leading to thrombosis. When thrombosis is identified the condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal antibodies that activate platelets. If someone receiving heparin develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the platelet count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Secretary of Commerce, Daniel Roper, {{appointed}} Flanders to the Business Advisory Council, {{which was}} created to provide input <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> on matters affecting business. The Council then made Flanders chairman of the Committee on Unemployment. This committee recommended addressing the problem both geographically and by industry. Flanders reported, however, that when the committee made its recommendations President Roosevelt was preoccupied with augmenting the Supreme Court and ultimately chose the undistributed profits tax instead—a choice that Flanders felt discouraged capital investment.|$|E

5|$|Mitoxantrone therapy may be {{associated}} with immunosuppressive effects and liver damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful adherence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a complete blood count before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy.|$|E
5|$|Nagore dargah is {{a common}} place of worship for devotees of various {{religious}} faiths. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of the dargah, about 50–75 per cent of pilgrims visiting the dargah everyday are Hindus. The practise of offering flowers, sweetmeats and food, the way of conducting worship, and playing musical instruments like nadaswaram (a type of pipe instrument commonly used in Tamil Nadu) are atypical of Hindu tradition. Other worship practises include offering flags and lighting lamps of ghee at the saint's tomb. Devotees shave their heads near the tank and offer tin or silver-plated facsimiles of body parts, houses, sailboats matching their material needs.|$|E

5|$|The {{impetus for}} {{federation}} {{did not extend}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of cricket, however. The ACC continued to attract criticism for being ineffectual and {{at a meeting of}} the Victorian Cricket Association in July 1898, Trott (in his capacity as a delegate for the South Melbourne club) tabled a motion that Victoria secede from the ACC. Although the proposal was defeated by a single vote, Trott was one of twelve Test players who signed a letter to the ACC secretary calling for the disbanding of the organisation. Failing to win the support of the players, the ACC folded in January 1900 following the withdrawal of the New South Wales Cricket Association.|$|E

One significant order given by Long was to transfer the USS Oregon (one of the Navy's most powerful ships) from the west coast to the Caribbean; the ship made the journey around Cape Horn from San Francisco to Key West, Florida, in 66 days. War was declared in April 1898. Roosevelt resigned his post the next month, a move Long thought foolhardy but later acknowledged was significant in advancing Roosevelt's career.|$|E

5|$|There are {{no records}} {{relating}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of the Mysore territory during the Vijayanagara Empire's reign (1399–1565). Signs of a well-organised and independent administration appear {{from the time}} of Raja Wodeyar I who {{is believed to have been}} sympathetic towards peasants (raiyats) who were exempted from any increases in taxation during his time. The first sign that the kingdom had established itself in the area was the issuing of gold coins (Kanthirayi phanam) resembling those of the erstwhile Vijayanagara Empire during Narasaraja Wodeyar's rule.|$|E
5|$|In 1197, Hubert Walter, who was Archbishop of Canterbury and Justiciar, {{appointed}} William <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of {{the royal}} stannaries, or tin mines, and in 1198 William was placed in charge of tin production, an office later known as the Lord Warden of the Stannaries. Under his control the mines became much more lucrative for the king, and accounted {{for a total of}} £1100 in William's first year of administration. As part of his administrative work he became the first warden of Lydford Castle after it was constructed in the 1190s. In 1199 he was involved in a dispute over the stannaries with another official, Hugh Bardulf, temporarily losing control of them– along with his office as sheriff– in 1200. The reason for the loss of these offices is uncertain. After restoration to office, he remained as Lord Warden of the Stannaries until 1215.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} year in office, Clarke {{established}} good order in the colony. Unlike Osborn, who treated Colenso's presence at the trials in 1888 as an affront, Clarke took up Colenso's cause and recommended to the Colonial Office in London that Dinuzulu and his uncles be allowed to return from exile, having been sufficiently punished for his supposed offences. Clarke, persuaded by Colenso, argued that Dinuzulu would not cause further trouble so long as the policy of fomenting intertribal strife were discontinued and Dinuzulu be appointed induna. He began the process for the return of Dinuzulu and sought to harness the authority of the Zulu leader <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration.</b> In January 1895, the exiles received notice of their return to Zululand with an official position for Dinuzulu. Their departure was set for February 1895 but was delayed after Ministers in London recommended that Zululand first be annexed to Natal.|$|E
