This study examined <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> students received in relation to key assignments in years two and three of a social work degree programme. The findings suggest that feedback is seldom used in a way that might enhance students understanding of 'race' issues.

40|$|PURPOSE: Psychology {{curricula}} {{need to be}} {{reflective of}} Australia's diverse populations. However, {{there appear to be}} many challenges, including student reactions to cross-cultural and Indigenous content. AIM: The aim {{of this study was to}} understand the rationale for varied written feedback from students regarding Indigenous and cross-cultural psychology teaching at one Australian university. METHOD: Undergraduate students were invited to participate in one of three focus groups (local group, Indigenous or international) to generate discussion and debate about <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> on cross-cultural and Indigenous psychology teaching. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A number of views were expressed in relation to <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> on course content. These views are considered in relation to their implications for teaching and learning practice. Allowing students to articulate further on written feedback is a valuable tool for understanding why views are held and how teaching and learning initiatives might be implemented or strengthened. Y.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} social science doctoral students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions and attitudes toward different characteristics of written feedback and written feedback providers for their academic writing. Moreover, it aimed to provide an explanatory model to describe the relationships between these perceptions and attitudes, students 2 ̆ 7 revision decisions, and other potentially relevant factors in their written feedback practices. The investigation was informed by two theoretical frameworks: principles of instructional design and conditions of learning, and situated learning and communities of practice. The study used a mixed methods approach in which qualitative data collection and analysis was followed by quantitative data collection and analysis. The main purpose of the qualitative phase was to develop a background to build a questionnaire to be used in the quantitative phase. The qualitative data were collected through interviews with 15 participants. Grounded theory data analysis methods were adapted in the qualitative analysis of the data. The quantitative data were collected through a questionnaire with 276 participants in two large mountain west public universities. Descriptive and multivariate correlational data analyses were employed for the analysis of the quantitative data. The results of this study provided descriptive information on doctoral students 2 ̆ 7 preferences for different types of written feedback and their perceptions and attitudes toward different characteristics of written feedback providers. Moreover, the structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis results showed that that there are several factors in the feedback practices of the doctoral students that have significant influences on some other factors in these feedback practices. An eight-factor model was developed constituting the following factors: (a) attitudes toward critical/negative written feedback, (b) motivations for academic writing, (c) perceptions of opportunities to write academic papers with faculty members in the department, (d) attitudes toward asking and searching for written feedback for academic papers, (e) attitudes toward feedback providers 2 ̆ 7 willingness and time to give feedback when asking for written feedback, (f) attitudes toward feedback providers 2 ̆ 7 personality when asking for written feedback, (g) revision decisions considering the external issues while examining <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>feedback,</b> and (h) revision decisions considering <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> characteristics and the need for the revisions while examining <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>feedback...</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Educational {{feedback}} is amongst {{the most powerful}} of all learning interventions. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: (1) Can we measure <b>the</b> quality of <b>written</b> educational <b>feedback</b> with acceptable metrics? (2) Based on such a measure, does a quality improvement (QI) intervention improve the quality of feedback? STUDY DESIGN: We developed a QI instrument to measure <b>the</b> quality of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> and applied it to <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> provided to medical students following workplace assessments. We evaluated the measurement characteristics of the QI score using generalisability theory. In an uncontrolled intervention, QI profiles were fed back to GP tutors and pre and post intervention scores compared. STUDY RESULTS: A single assessor scoring 6 feedback summaries can discriminate between practices with a reliability of 0. 82. The quality of feedback rose for two years after the introduction of the QI instrument and stabilised in the third year. The estimated annual cost to provide this {{feedback is}} £ 12 per practice. Interpretation and recommendations: It is relatively straightforward and inexpensive to measure <b>the</b> quality of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> with good reliability.

40|$|AbstractThis study explores students’ {{perceptions}} of assessment feedback they receive, its usage and their expectations. A quantitative {{data collection and}} analysis were used to survey 92 final semester undergraduate students at faculty of accountancy of UiTM Perlis. Students’ responses showed that they value feedback irrespective of the marks they received and appreciated the model answers given by their lecturers. They moderately satisfied with the current practice of feedback system. The students expected to receive their feedback on quizzes ‘one week after’ and showed more tolerance with the timeframe for tests and assignments. The most preferred types of feedback were written and individual. However more than 2 / 3 of the respondents felt that <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> they received was not always clearly written and hardly to understand. One half of the respondents did not object their continuous assessment marks to be displayed on the lecturers’ notice board...|$|E

Of qualitative research patterns, the case study method has been employed in this study. The research group of the study is made up of a total of 12 preservice elementary mathematics teachers studying the fourth grade at the department of elementary mathematics teaching in a state university located in the Eastern Anatolian Region of Turkey during the fall semester of the 2013 - 2014 academic year. In the study, to get the opinions of preservice teachers on the concept of instructional activity, a written feedback form containing three open-ended questions was applied to the preservice teachers. Then, content analysis was conducted on the data obtained from <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> form. The study has revealed that preservice teachers have different opinions on the concept of instructional activity...|$|E
40|$|In {{independent}} learning contexts, {{the effectiveness of}} the feedback dialogue between student and tutor or, {{in the absence of a}} tutor, the quality of the learning materials, is essential to successful learning. Using the voices of participants as the prime source of data through a combination of data-driven and concept-driven approaches, this investigation attempts to gain deeper insights into the dynamics of the learning process as students express emotional reactions to the learning environment and in particular <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> from their tutors and the learning materials. To account for the different ways in which adult learners studying independently engage both cognitively and emotionally with external feedback, we propose a model based on four key drivers: goal relevance, knowledge, self-confidence, and roles. We conclude that only when these key drivers are aligned with each other can learners in independent settings engage with external feedback and learn from it...|$|E
40|$|Magister Curationis - MCurBackground: <b>Written</b> <b>feedback</b> from lecturers {{to their}} students, in higher {{education}} institutions, {{plays an important role}} in improving students’ performance. However, students’ perceptions of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> on assessments could influence its utilization to improve their performance. Despite the high priority placed on <b>written</b> <b>feedback,</b> to date, insufficient research studies have been conducted on the student nurses’ perceptions of <b>written</b> <b>feedback.</b> Purpose and Objective: The purpose of this descriptive study is to describe student nurses’ perceptions of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> on assessments at a university in the Western Cape. The objective of this study is to determine student nurses’ perceptions of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> on assessment. Methodology: A quantitative descriptive survey research design was employed to conduct this study at a university in the Western Cape. The target population for this study was 106 student nurses registered in the nursing foundation programme for the year 2015. This study employed all-inclusive sampling of foundation student nurses registered in the year 2015. A questionnaire was used to collect data from the participants. A total of 74 participants were available for the study, of whom, 69 submitted their questionnaires, resulting to a response rate of 93. 2 %. The data was analyzed by using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23 and was presented in frequency tables, percentages and bar graphs. Ethics approval was obtained from the Senate Higher Degree and the Senate Research Committees of the institution under study, before commencing. Permission was also obtained from the Dean of Research and Head of the School of Nursing, before the commencement of the study. The purpose of the study was explained, and a consent form was signed, before the questionnaires were administered to participants. Findings: The findings of this study indicated that students receive feedback on assessment, were in line with the assessment criteria. The study also found that students perceived receiving plenty of quality <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> in good time to be useful. The results of this study indicated that the inability to understand <b>written</b> <b>feedback,</b> <b>the</b> limited opportunity to clarify <b>feedback</b> and negatively <b>written</b> comments, hinders <b>the</b> use of <b>written</b> <b>feedback.</b> Recommendations: There is the need for lecturers to provide <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> that could be useful for students to improve on their performance. There is also <b>the</b> need for <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> to be delivered to students electronically. Lecturers need to discuss <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> with their students after delivery. The need for a qualitative study to be conducted on student’s and lecturers experiences on <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> on assessment is recommended...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> {{component}} of a community and school Maori to English literacy transition programme implemented in a kura kaupapa Maori (Maori language immersion school. 21 Year 6, 7 and 8 students received responsive <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> for their <b>writing</b> in English, over a ten-week period, during their weekly independent writing time. Students’ stories were mailed to a young Maori woman (the third author) in a provincial city 100 kilometres from the kura.

30|$|From the SCT {{perspective}} to feedback, {{there are two}} important issues that L 2 writing instructors should pay attention to. The first one is determining learners’ ZPD. Determining learners’ ZPD requires language teachers to differentiate between proficient and less proficient writers. This, in turn, will help teachers situate their <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> more explicitly or implicitly depending on the ZPD of students. Secondly, L 2 writing instructors {{should be able to}} make their <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> more explicit, if implicit feedback does not result in student uptake in a subsequent draft. <b>The</b> theorization of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> in this paper aims not only to provide academic writing instructors with a framework that would be helpful in casting their feedback according to students’ ZPD, but it will also help provide more explicit feedback in subsequent drafts, if implicit feedback does not work.|$|R
