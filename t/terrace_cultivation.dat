30|$|The WFIUH {{model is}} a very useful tool for {{evaluating}} ecosystem services related flood risk assessment, runoff abatement, and erosion control, as illustrated in a previous study on the combined effects of drainage density and <b>terrace</b> <b>cultivation</b> in Southern France (Hallema and Moussa, 2014).

40|$|Soil erosion {{has become}} a serious problem in recent decades due to unhalted trends of {{unsustainable}} land use practices. Assessment of soil erosion is a prominent tool in planning and conservation of soil and water resource ecosystems. The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) was applied to Nyabarongo River Catchment that drains about 8413. 75 km 2 (33 %) of the total Rwanda coverage and {{a small part of}} the Southern Uganda (about 64. 50 km 2) using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing technologies. The estimated total annual actual soil loss was approximately estimated at 409 million tons with a mean erosion rate of 490 t·ha− 1 ·y− 1 (i. e., 32. 67 mm·y− 1). The cropland that occupied 74. 85 % of the total catchment presented a mean erosion rate of 618 t·ha− 1 ·y− 1 (i. e., 41. 20 mm·y− 1) and was responsible for 95. 8 % of total annual soil loss. Emergency soil erosion control is required with a priority accorded to cropland area of 173, 244 ha, which is extremely exposed to actual soil erosion rate of 2222 t·ha− 1 ·y− 1 (i. e., 148. 13 mm·y− 1) and contributed to 96. 2 % of the total extreme soil loss in the catchment. According to this study, <b>terracing</b> <b>cultivation</b> method could reduce the current erosion rate in cropland areas by about 78 %. Therefore, the present study suggests the catchment management by constructing check dams, terracing, agroforestry and reforestation of highly exposed areas as suitable measures for erosion and water pollution control within the Nyabarongo River Catchment and in other regions facing the same problems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Rice is {{the staple}} food and it {{occupies}} about 70 per {{cent of the}} total area under cultivation and constitutes about 75 per cent of the total food production in the state. For generations, Naga farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, under Jhum—a sophisticated form of slash and burn agriculture, clearing plots to plant rice intermixed with dozens of other crops. The Angami and Chakesang tribes of Nagaland have <b>terrace</b> <b>cultivation</b> of paddy wherever water is available for irrigation. Such indigenous knowledge system in the region had been developed through experience by tribal farmers using their ingenuity and skill and {{are believed to have}} sustainable agricultural base. Zabo system of rice cultivation is an excellent indigenous method of rain water harvesting used by the farmers in Phek district of Nagaland. The Jhumia of Kohima and Phek district of Nagaland plant alder trees in the jhum cycle area along with traditional agricultural crops such as rice. Since agriculture in Nagaland is dependent on the monsoon rain, cultivation is carried out only once a year. Researchers and planners should not ignore the actual knowledge these local people hold on efficient farming rather consider them for better implementation of any new farming practice/technique in the region. This paper is based on secondary sources such as books, Articles, Reports etc. The primary data which were qualitative in nature was obtained through interaction with few farmers or key informants in Kohima, Wokha and Phek districts of Nagaland...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} an ethnoarchaeological {{approach to}} the study of traditional Mediterranean pastoral economies through a case-study of two mountainous village territories in eastern Spain. The research has two main aims: first to rescue an important corpus of ethnographic data from a rural community whose traditional economy is being eroded and secondly, to provide insights into how pastoral economies in antiquity can be studied archaeologically. The thesis adopts an interdisciplinary methodology, synthesising oral, documentary and archaeological data sources, and applying the techniques of landscape archaeology. The research ultimately examines two aspects of the pastoral economy that leave signatures in the archaeological record: herd management strategies and pastoral sites. Throughout, it is emphasised that a pastoral economy based on sheep and goat herding is intricately linked - socially, economically and physically - to an agricultural landscape of <b>terrace</b> <b>cultivation.</b> Chapter 1 defines the scope and purpose of the research and Chapter 2 presents the geographical, historical and archaeological setting for the case-study. Chapter 3 explores aspects of traditional pastoral land-use and examines linkages between terrace agriculture and herding. Chapter 4 is concerned principally with ethnographic data relating to herd management su ategies and develops a model of kill-off pattern analysis through computer simulation. Chapters 5 and 6 address pastoral sites within the study area: the former analyses structural and spatial aspects, whereas the latter deals with abandonment processes and site taphonomy. Chapter 7 draws the conclusions of these chapters together and Chapter 8 explores the wider implications of the study. Appendices I-III contain primary documentry and archaeozoological data and Appendices IV-V comprise a gazetteer of pastoral sites within the study area...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} {{some of the}} factors contributing to the piping process in abandoned terraces in seven sites located in the Murcia Region (southeast Spain). The local landscape has the appearance of badland geomorphology, possessing deep valleys which until the 1970 s were terraced and cultivated. The terraces have now been abandoned to the piping process. The research focuses {{on the relationship between}} the size and position of pipes and the physical and geochemistry properties of the local highly dispersive marl lithology; {{and the extent to which}} the reworking of the materials for <b>terrace</b> <b>cultivation</b> has exacerbated piping erosion. Morphologically, the terracing in the stream beds has resulted in a series of gentle benches separated by steeper risers with variable ‘drop’, (riser height). A series of flat infiltration surfaces result, and because the resculpting produces a reduced bulk density infill with enhanced throughflow, infiltrating water is forced along steep hydraulic gradients to a low outfall at the base of the riser. Paralleling studies of land levelling and terrace abandonment in similar materials elsewhere, piping in the study area is shown to be closely related to the physical and chemical characteristics of the materials its sodicity and dispersive character. Considerable differences in structure, texture, mineralogical composition and material's surface crust and subsoil geochemical properties emerged from ‘site signature’ plots, and these results suggest that agricultural processes affect the dispersive character of the crust materials, presumably because agricultural activity increases the buffering effect of organic acids on the dispersed clay. This is supported by the observation that on the one site that was levelled but not used for agriculture, a stable organically-distinct crust like the abandoned agricultural sites has not formed. The changes to the material's aggregate stability and bulk density properties when terracing occurs is examined, but insufficient evidence is available from the data collected to unpick the causes of aggregate stability changes in the study plots. The way in which differences between crust and subsoil enhance infiltration is discussed, and the role of the terrace ‘drop’ in influencing hydraulic gradients and pipe development is illustrated. A possible index to describe the relationship between evacuated material volumes and the controlling parameters discussed above is tested. It is concluded that terracing which is intended as a conservation practice has, in dispersive materials, actually enhanced piping, leading to the abandonment of farming...|$|E
