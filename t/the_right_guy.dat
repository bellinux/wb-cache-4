So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because I know that when I pick <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>guy,</b> I can let him have it.

500|$|In the 1970s, Olympic {{athletes were}} {{considered}} to be amateurs and were not allowed to seek or accept payment for their positions as sports celebrities. During the Cold War in 1972, three major Olympic titles that had a long history of American successbasketball, the 100 meter dash, and decathlonwere won by Soviet athletes. Jenner became an American hero by returning the decathlon title to the United States. [...] "After the Games were over," [...] Jenner said, [...] "I happened to be <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>guy,</b> at that right place, at that right time." [...] Tony Kornheiser of The New York Times wrote: [...] "Jenner is twirling the nation like a baton.

5000|$|When {{cloud cover}} would {{suddenly}} change the light during {{the shooting of}} a particular baseball scene, Sayles showed [...] "inspirational decisiveness", according to Elle, by changing the scripted game they would be shooting—switching from Game Two of the series to Game Four, for example. [...] "The second assistant director knew nothing about baseball", Sayles said, [...] "and she had {{to keep track of}} who was on base. Suddenly we'd change from Game Two to Game Four, and she'd have to shuffle through her papers to learn who was on second, then track <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>guys</b> down all over the ballpark." ...|$|R
500|$|Lee Tamahori {{was hired}} to direct Die Another Day; Barbara Broccoli admired his film Once Were Warriors, calling it [...] "a phenomenal piece of filmmaking". Broccoli noted that she and Wilson [...] "sensed his genuine enthusiasm for Bond. It was simply great chemistry. Lee was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>guy</b> and we were very, very lucky to get him". Screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade {{returned}} and began work {{in the summer of}} 2000 with the producers. They used a premise from Fleming's novel Moonraker as a basis, that of an industrialist villain who had two identities. With the planned release of the film being in the 40th anniversary year of the Bond film series, Tamahori named the Hong Kong hotel seen in the film the [...] "Rubyeon Royale", for Eon's ruby anniversary, as well as Fleming's first novel, Casino Royale.|$|E
500|$|On March 21, 2005, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ryan Merriman, co-stars of The Ring Two (2005), {{were cast}} as Wendy Christensen and Kevin Fischer. Winstead, who had auditioned {{for the second}} Final Destination film, won the role because her {{portrayal}} of the character's emotion impressed Wong and Morgan. Wong {{said that he had}} originally intended for Wendy to be a [...] "perky blonde" [...] and reworked the character slightly after Winstead was cast; he believed the actors were right for their roles. On Winstead, he said that [...] " [...] a kind of soulfulness to her role as Wendy" [...] and her character [...] "is deeply affected by the accident, but she's strong, and fights to maintain control". On Merriman, he said that [...] "the moment [...] came in I thought he was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>guy</b> to play Kevin" [...] and described the character as [...] "the kind of guy you want to hang out with, your goofy best buddy, but also someone who could rise to the occasion and become a hero".|$|E

2500|$|We {{were at the}} end of our {{recording}} {{contract with}} Century Media, and basically they didn't know if we were going to re-sign with them, so they gave us a very small budget for our last album to work with. That was about $20,000 which is a nothing deal to do a record. What we needed to do at the time was to find a producer that was immediately available to make a record with such a small budget, and that guy was Kelly Gray (laughs). Unfortunately, he was just not <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>guy</b> to do this album." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1977 Ben-Menashe joined Israel's Military Intelligence Directorate. He {{later said}} [...] "I {{happened}} to be <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>guy</b> at the right time. I spoke Persian, Arabic, English. I knew the United States." [...] In his book Profits of War: Inside the Secret U.S.-Israeli Arms Network Ben-Menashe said that following the 1979 Iranian Revolution his Iranian background provided useful connections, {{with some of his}} school friends playing roles in the new government. These connections, Ben-Menashe said, led to his playing an intermediary role in the Israeli effort to sell arms to Iran, and close to the Israeli government decision to back the Reagan campaign's [...] "October Surprise" [...] efforts to ensure Iranian hostages were released on a timetable that strengthened Ronald Reagan and not the incumbent President Carter.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{the investigative}} {{magazine}} Mother Jones, “Jasser has lately become <b>the</b> <b>right’s</b> go-to <b>guy</b> {{when it comes}} to providing cover for policies or positions that many Muslim Americans contend are discriminatory. When controversy over the so-called Ground Zero mosque erupted, Jasser, a frequent guest on Fox News, accused the builders of trying to ‘diminish what happened’ on September 11, 2001. He has supported statewide bans on Shariah law in American courts and has helped bolster conservative warnings that American Muslims seek to replace the Constitution with a harsh interpretation of Islamic law. Many American Muslim groups, meanwhile, view Jasser as a reliable apologist for Republicans and anti-Muslim figures—one with little grassroots support in the American Muslim community.” ...|$|R

2500|$|When it {{came time}} to record the score for Double Indemnity, Lipstone made no secret that he despised what Rózsa had done, to which Wilder finally turned to him and snapped, [...] "You may be {{surprised}} to hear that I love it. Okay?" [...] Lipstone then disappeared and was not seen at the sessions again. He later summoned Rózsa to his office and reprimanded him for writing [...] "Carnegie Hall music" [...] which had no place in a film. Rózsa took this as a compliment, but Lipstone assured him it was not – and suggested he listen to the music from Madame Curie to learn how to write a proper film score. When Rózsa pointed out that Double Indemnity was a love story, Lipstone suggested his music was more appropriate to The Battle of Russia. Lipstone was convinced that as soon as the studio's Artistic Director, Buddy DeSylva, heard the music he would throw it out. At a screening soon after, DeSylva called him over: expecting heads to roll, Lipstone eagerly huddled with his chief – only to have DeSylva praise the music, saying it was exactly the dissonant, hard-hitting score the film needed. The boss's only criticism: there was not enough of it. By this time Lipstone had an arm around DeSylva, asking unctuously, [...] "I always find you <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>guy</b> for the job, Buddy, don't I?" ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{context of}} argumentation and debate, {{labelling}} a debator or position is often (whether consciously or unconsciously) {{used as a}} [...] "red herring" [...] to divert or dismiss the argument, in stead of valid argumentation. Often {{in the form of}} ad hominem association fallacy aiming at accrediting or discrediting the argument or the debator by associating them with an emotionally charged label. Typically negatively; labelling it as ridiculous or despicable, though it can also go the other way round; attempting to gain sympathy for example by promoting the debator or position as authoritative, or by appealing to pity. - Using labelling in argumentation this way constitute an informal fallacy. - For example:The guy believed that it can be done with <b>the</b> <b>right</b> technology.*The <b>guy</b> is a perverted pansy.

The poet was a rag of a man, dark, little, and lean, with hollow cheeks and thin black locks. He carried his four-and-twenty years with feverish animation. Greed had made folds about his eyes, evil smiles had puckered his mouth. The wolf and pig struggled together in his face. It was an eloquent, sharp, ugly, earthly countenance. His hands were small and prehensile, with fingers knotted like a cord; and they were continually flickering {{in front of him}} in violent and expressive pantomime. As for Tabary, a broad, complacent, admiring imbecility breathed from his squash nose and slobbering lips: he had become a thief, just as he might have become the most decent of burgesses, by the imperious chance that rules the lives of human geese and human donkeys.|$|R
