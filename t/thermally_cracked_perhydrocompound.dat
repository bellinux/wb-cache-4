Cleaning at 400 degreesC results in the formation of a (2 x 4) reconstructed As-terminated surface. A short anneal (5 min) under an As- 2 flux at 600 degreesC produces an atomically smooth surface, which is comparable in quality to that obtained after conventional substrate preparation by thermal oxide removal and prolonged homoepitaxial buffer growth. Our results show that AH cleaning is a very effective method for preparing clean GaAs(001) surfaces for use in an epitaxial growth environment without any further treatment. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|An {{alternate}} route to parylene AF-4 was developed as shown above. The advantage {{to this process}} is the low cost of synthesis for the precursor. The precursor is also a liquid and can be delivered by standard methods developed in the Semiconductor Industry, such as with a vaporizer, vaporizer with a bubbler, or a mass-flow controller. Originally the precursor was just <b>thermally</b> <b>cracked</b> to yield the same intermediate as that produced from the cyclophane; however, {{with the use of}} catalysts the 'cracking' temperature can be lowered resulting in less char in the pyrolysis zone and a higher quality polymer thin film. By either method atomic bromine (bromine containing a free-radical) is given off as a by-product and is easily converted to hydrogen bromide, which has to be properly processed or equipment damage will occur.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Non Interaction Approximation (NIA) is {{currently}} used to relate effective elastic moduli to crack density. It also {{allows one to}} identify the anisotropy of the crack network. We investigated <b>thermally</b> <b>cracked</b> glass sample and quantified the crack network (using SEM). From elastic wave velocity measurements, using EMT, we obtained the crack densities: D 1 = 0. 038 (horizontal one) and D 3 = 0. 0037 (vertical one). From SEM observations and image processing we could identify all cracks, count them and determine independently the crack density. These results agree with the previously determined ones from the elastic wave velocity measurements (within a small uncertainty range). These {{results indicate that the}} NIA is quite accurate in the considered range of crack densities, and elastic wave velocity measurements can provide reliable information on their crack distribution and crack density...|$|R

Initially, the reactor is loaded with glass pellets and then the rapeseed oil was fed into the reactor. At hydrothermal condition of 300 to 410 oC, the formation of oxygenate groups (i. e. esters, acids and aldehydes) were 15 to 30 %, while the rest contained <b>thermally</b> <b>cracked</b> hydrocarbons with excluded un-reacted feed.

40|$|The {{growth of}} self-assembled InN {{nanostructures}} on GaN by MBE {{has been studied}} using two different nitrogen sources. Stranski-Krastanov growth may be achieved but is highly sensitive to the V: III ratio as well as coverage and temperature.

Using <b>thermally</b> <b>cracked</b> ammonia, Stranski-Krastanov growth occurred only for thin layers (up to 8 monolayers) at high V: III ratios, as observed by RHEED and AIM. The sensitivity of the growth to the V: III ratio may be explained in terms of the interplay between equilibrium thermodynamics and growth kinetics. Similar experiments at higher V:III ratios were performed using a modified nitrogen plasma source. Stranski-Krastanov growth occurred and was observed in-situ by RHEED.

40|$|Abstract Subcritical {{fracture}} {{driven by}} <b>thermally</b> activated <b>crack</b> nucleation is {{studied in the}} framework of a fiber bundle model. Based on analytic calculations and computer simulations, we show that, in the presence of stress inhomogeneity <b>thermally</b> activated <b>cracking</b> results in an anomalous size effect, i. e., the average lifetime of the system decreases as a power-law of the system size. We propose a modified Arrhenius law which provides a comprehensive description of the load, temperature, and size dependence of the lifetime of the system. On the microscopic level, thermal fluctuations trigger bursts of breaking events which proved to have a power-law size distribution. The waiting times between consecutive bursts are also power-law distributed with an exponent switching between 1 and 2 as the load and temperature are varied. Analyzing the structural entropy and the location of consecutive bursts, we show that, in the presence of stress concentration, the acceleration of the rupture process close to failure is the consequence of damage localization...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the growth of thin layers of indium nitride (InN) on gallium nitride (GaN) by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) using two different nitrogen sources. Using <b>thermally</b> <b>cracked</b> ammonia as the nitrogen source, we explored {{the effect of the}} V:III ratio by varying the ammonia pressure. With a low V:III ratio, we did not detect InN growth, and instead observed the formation of irregularly shaped indium islands on the GaN surface. With higher VAII ratios, nanostructure growth was observed for thin (approximate to 2 ML) layers. Further deposition resulted in the growth of polycrystalline material. The differences between the two pressure regimes may be explained in terms of the interplay between equilibrium thermodynamics and growth kinetics. We performed similar experiments at higher VAII ratios using a modified nitrogen plasma source. Stranski-Krastanov growth occurred, {{and we were able to}} obtain high-temperature in vacuo STM images of the as-grown nanostructures. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{electrical}} down-hole heaters {{have been}} proposed, which involve the provision electrical current to generate heat to {{the vicinity of}} the wellbore, increase temperature, lower oil viscosity and improve oil production rate (Rodriguez et al. 2008). The technique eliminates the injection of heat carrying fluids into the well; however, the distribution of heat through the entire oil-bearing geologic formation remains one of the major drawbacks of the technique (Weissman et al. 1996). On the other hand, the CAPRI™ process has the ability to further upgrade the <b>thermally</b> <b>cracked</b> heavy crude oil by THAI™ process to almost light crude, as it flows across the catalyst liner along the ‘toe-to-heel’ horizontal production wellbore of the CAPRI. Therefore, in this paper, the potential of the newly proposed novel THAI–CAPRI™ process for heavy oil recovery and upgrading in situ would be reviewed in comparison to other thermal EOR technologies, with the hope that findings will help direct future research and experiment towards providing practical solutions to the challenges presently encountered in heavy oil and bitumen exploitation.|$|R

Plastic wastes such as, polypropylene, low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, polystyrene are the most frequently used in everyday activities and disposed of to the environment after service. Plastic are those substances which can take long periods of time to decompose if disposed off simply to the environment. Therefore, waste plastic should be changed into usable resources. The different waste plastics were <b>thermally</b> <b>cracked</b> at different temperature and then it was tried to measure the oil produced, the residue left after the reaction is completed, and the gas produced.

There are a number of methods by which plastic wastes can be managed such as incineration, recycling, land filling, and thermal cracking. But this work focuses on thermal cracking of waste plastic to change them into usable resources, because in this method the emission of hazardous gases to the environment insignificant.

Delayed coking, a method by which residues are <b>thermally</b> <b>cracked</b> (large heavy molecules broken into smaller lighter molecules), produces liquid products and solid coke which can both be sold for further profit. In order {{to increase the amount}} of liquid products produced since they are the most value added product of the coking process catalysts (platinum on 0. 5 % alumina and nickel (skeletal),molybdenum promoted (1 wt%)) were tested to see how they would affect the process and products.

Gas chromatography based on ASTM D 2887 was used to analyze gaseous products every 15 minutes during each test and the liquid products at the end.

Further research into these and other catalysts is recommended since residues from different crudes could interact differently with the catalysts...|$|R

40|$|Detailed {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} premixed and non-premixed C_ 2 H_ 4 /air flames were conducted, using six available kinetic mechanisms. The results help assess {{differences between these}} mechanisms and are of interest to proposed hydrocarbon-fueled SCRAMJET concepts, in which C_ 2 H_ 4 {{can be expected to}} be a major component of the <b>thermally</b> <b>cracked</b> fuel. For premixed flames, laminar flame speeds were calculated and compared with available experimental data. For non-premixed flames, ignition/extinction Z-curves were calculated for conditions of relevance to proposed SCRAMJET concepts. Results revealed a large variance in predictions of the kinetic mechanisms examined. Differences in laminar flame speeds as high as factors of 2. 5 were found. For the conditions investigated, computed ignition and extinction strain rates for non-premixed flames differed by factors as high as 300 and 3, respectively. This indicates that while there are differences in high-temperature kinetics that control flame propagation and extinction, discrepancies in low-temperature kinetics that control ignition can be even more significant. Sensitivity- and species-consumption analyses indicate uncertainties in fuel kinetics and, most importantly, on the oxidation of C_ 2 H_ 3 and the production of CH_ 2 CHO, whose kinetics are not well known and can crucially affect production of the important H radicals.

40|$|The {{problems}} heretofore with {{coal gasification}} and IGCC concepts have been their high cost and historical poor performance of fixed-bed gasifiers, particularly on caking coals. The Gasification Product Improvement Facility (GPIF) project {{is being developed}} to solve these problems {{through the development of}} a novel coal gasification invention which incorporates pyrolysis (carbonization) with gasification (fixed-bed). It employs a pyrolyzer (carbonizer) to avoid sticky coal agglomeration caused in the conventional process of gradually heating coal through the 400 F to 900 F range. In so doing, the coal is rapidly heated sufficiently such that the coal tar exists in gaseous form rather than as a liquid. Gaseous tars are then <b>thermally</b> <b>cracked</b> prior to the completion of the gasification process. During the subsequent endothermic gasification reactions, volatilized alkali can become chemically bound to aluminosilicates in (or added to) the ash. To reduce NH{sub 3 } and HCN from fuel born nitrogen, steam injection is minimized, and residual nitrogen compounds are partially chemically reduced in the cracking stage in the upper gasifier region. Assuming testing confirms successful deployment of all these integrated processes, future IGCC applications will be much simplified, require significantly less mechanical components, and will likely achieve the $ 1, 000 /kWe commercialized system cost goal of the GPIF project.

During maturation, sporopollenin exhibits {{a wide range of}} colours before there are any significant changes in Rsp. The immature phase is characterised by subtle colour changes through a series of progressively darkening yellows. This coincides with a reduction in the relative proportion of >C=O groups and an increase in the relative proportion of aliphatic –CH 2 and –CH 3 groups. During the mature phase, functional groups within spores and pollen are <b>thermally</b> <b>cracked</b> to generate hydrocarbons. Their colours change rapidly through orange and brown and the FT–IR data indicate the loss of a considerable portion of the aliphatic groups and increases in the C=C content associated with aromatic rings. Significant structural reorganisation during the spore ‘oil-window’ results in the formation of isolated aromatic rings. A further increase in maturity yields little change in colour but a rapid increase in reflectivity. This is caused by the formation of multi-ring aromatic units from isolated aromatic units. The size of these polyaromatic units increases with rank. Investigation of artificially matured samples of Lycopodium clavatum spores indicates considerable chemical differences in >C=O, C=C and aromatic skeletal structure, in comparison to fossil palynomorphs, although they progress through a similar series of colours.
