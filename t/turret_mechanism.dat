5000|$|Sahat Kula {{was built}} in 1667, by Adži-paša Osmanagić, a {{prominent}} citizen of Podgorica. It is a freestanding 19m tall stone clock tower. Its current <b>turret</b> clock <b>mechanism</b> was made in 1890 by Pietro Colbachini foundry in Bassano del Grappa, Italy, after Podgorica was incorporated into Montenegro (original mechanism was made in Austria). Around the same time, a metal cross was installed {{at the top of}} the tower, symbolizing transfer of the city from the Ottomans into the hands of Christian Montenegrins.

5000|$|KV-2 (334) - A heavy assault {{tank with}} the M-10 152 mm howitzer, the KV-2 was {{produced}} {{at the same}} time as the KV-1. Due to the size of its heavy turret and gun, the KV-2 was slower and had a much higher profile than the KV-1. Those captured and used by the German Army were known as (Sturm)Panzer kampfwagen KV-II 754(r). Few were produced due to its combat ineffectiveness, mainly the decreased speed due to the weight of the new gun and turret. Due to the increased turret weight due to expanded dimensions and a heavier gun, the <b>turret</b> traverse <b>mechanism</b> could work only on level ground.|$|R
5000|$|Pascal {{went through}} 50 prototypes before {{settling}} on his final design; {{we know that he}} started with some sort of calculating clock mechanism that used springs which apparently [...] "works by springs and which has a very simple design", was used [...] "many times" [...] and remained in [...] "operating order". Nevertheless, [...] "while always improving on it" [...] he found reason {{to try to make the}} whole system more reliable and robust. Eventually he adopted a component of very large clocks, shrinking and adapting for his purpose the robust gears that can be found in a <b>turret</b> clock <b>mechanism</b> called a lantern gear, itself derived from a water wheel mechanism. This could easily handle the strength of an operator input.|$|R
5000|$|The weapon {{consists}} of two stabilized NN-30 30 mm water-cooled four chamber revolver cannons, which are mounted inside a riveted steel <b>turret.</b> The gun <b>mechanism</b> is gas operated. The guns each weigh 155 kg and have barrels 1930 mm long, and a total length of 2670 mm. The barrels are rifled with 12 grooves. The guns each have a rate of fire of 1,000 round per minute; they are fed by independent 500-round belts of ammunition.|$|R
50|$|His {{aircraft}} was severely damaged on a raid over Düsseldorf in March 1943, with his <b>turret's</b> rotation <b>mechanism</b> rendered inoperable and a wing on fire. While the crew prepared to bail out, the pilot heard Williams calling {{him to turn}} starboard, allowing his machine guns to bear on a closing German nightfighter, which blew up. The bomber dropped its bomb load, but was attacked by a second German fighter. With bullet wounds in his stomach and legs, Williams legs were paralysed, {{but he managed to}} shoot down the second fighter. The Halifax limped back to England, where it crash-landed. Williams was cut out of his turret, and spent several months in the hospital recuperating from his injuries. He was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal. He later said that he had been told he would have received the Victoria Cross if he had died.|$|R

50|$|In 1984, the Soviets began {{production}} of a diesel-engined variant of the BTR-70, which they called the BTR-80. The Soviets have retrofitted some BTR-70s with several of the improvements incorporated into the BTR-80, including the high-angle-of-fire turret. The twin doors are designed to allow the infantry to disembark while the vehicle is in motion, and allow the infantry inside to exit from one side if the other is receiving fire. The 30mm Cannon variants are effective against most targets apart from main battle tanks, against which they can still cause significant damage to optics, weapons, and important systems. The main gun is not stabilized, so accurate fire on the move is limited to low speeds, and the <b>turret's</b> rotation <b>mechanism</b> is manually operated. The gunner sits in a roof-mounted chair located above the flat floor behind the driver/commander and two passengers, and before the passenger bench. The gunner's station is basic, but uncharacteristically spacious for a Soviet armored vehicle. The gunner is equipped with both a day time optical sight and an infrared night sight.|$|R

50|$|As {{the middle}} {{section of the}} clock tower, where the dials are, is {{narrower}} than the base on which it stands and its roof above, the tower's square ridged copper roof has four overhanging eaves, each of which are supported by an exposed, exoskeleton copper column resting on the tower's square base. On top of the clock's roof stands the open-to-air bell tower surrounded by a circle of eight copper pillars and a single bell hangs within. The bell tower is crowned with a circular copper roof upon which a copper spire rises with a dragon-head weather wane, also in copper. The <b>turret</b> clock (<b>mechanism)</b> was manufactured by Linderoths Urverk (Stockholm) in 1937 and after face design and adjustment by Stefan Anderson was installed in 1938. All four dials and the bell were driven from the same mechanism. In 1976, the town council appointed local watchmaker Karl-Arne Carlsson from Grängesberg as the town's first official Timekeeper, responsible for maintaining the Town Hall Clock. In late 2004 the mechanical turret clock was retired together with its keeper, and replaced with a self-maintaining digital timepiece controlling five independent electrical mechanisms, one for each dial and the bell.|$|R
