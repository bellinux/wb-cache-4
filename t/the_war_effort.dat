5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature. It was by the actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly to <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>effort.</b> Morton suppressed the state legislature {{with the help of the}} Republican minority to prevent it from assembling during 1861 and 1862. This prevented any chance the Democrats might have had to interfere with <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>effort</b> or to attempt to secede from the Union.|$|E

Soon after <b>the</b> <b>war</b> broke out, <b>the</b> nationalization came.|$|R

5|$|Since the Pioneer Zephyr {{was built}} of {{stainless}} steel, {{which is not}} as recyclable as aluminum, the train was spared from the metal recycling drives of World War II.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>war</b> <b>effort</b> was {{the source}} of {{continued}} disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>effort,</b> and any manner of compromise alienated factions {{on both sides of the}} aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.|$|E

5|$|A {{recession}} in the 1930s was halted by increasing international tensions as World War II loomed; Sheffield's steel factories were set to work manufacturing weapons and ammunition for <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>effort.</b> As a result, the city became a target for bombing raids, the heaviest of which occurred on the nights of 12 and 15 December 1940, {{now known as the}} Sheffield Blitz.

Feminists and others have seized upon the uplifting attitude and apparent message to remake the image into many different forms, including self empowerment, campaign promotion, advertising, and parodies.|$|E
