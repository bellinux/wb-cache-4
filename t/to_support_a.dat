5|$|A {{regional}} {{transit authority}} {{was formed in}} the early 1990s to build and operate a light rail system that would use the bus tunnel within Downtown Seattle.

In 1998, Sound Transit found that the rails in the tunnel {{would need to be}} replaced at a cost of up to $110 million and require a full closure for two years. The plan would also require the purchase of new hybrid electric buses to replace the Breda fleet, as the electrical systems were incompatible.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June23. It reached the eastern Pacific on July3, where associated convection began to increase three days later. Continued slow development occurred thereafter, and following satellite trends, the disturbance was upgraded to Tropical Depression Four-E at 1800UTC on July9. Tracking westward, the depression {{began to move}} across waters too cool <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone and into an environment of moderate shear. The low-level circulation became ill-defined and exposed, leading to degeneration to a remnant low at 0600UTC on July11 about 910mi (1465km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The low continued northwest until dissipation at 0000UTC the following day.|$|E
5|$|After {{visiting the}} village of Annisa to see his dying sister Macrina, he {{returned}} to Nyssa in August. In 380 he travelled to Sebaste, {{in the province of}} Armenia Prima, <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>a</b> pro-Nicene candidate for the election to the bishopric. To his surprise, he himself was elected to the seat, perhaps due to the population's association of him with his brother. However, Gregory deeply disliked the relatively unhellenized society of Armenia, and he was confronted by an investigation into his orthodoxy by local opponents of the Nicene theology. After a stay of several months, a substitute was found - possibly Gregory's brother Peter, who was bishop of Sebaste from 381 - and Gregory returned home to Nyssa to write books I and II of Against Eunomius.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} rising {{importance}} of a central administration arose {{a new class of}} educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy could no longer afford <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>a</b> large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150BC, is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.|$|E
