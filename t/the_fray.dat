5|$|At {{the early}} stages of development, Minagawa {{revealed}} that numerous ideas and features were planned for the game, but were dropped from the final stages due to certain constraints and hardware limitations. Some of these included the ability for a second player to join in the gameplay, enabling a two-player mode. Another idea that was given a considerable amount of thought was the ability to recruit non-player characters to join in the mob hunts. Due to the technical limitations of the console and multiple number of characters joining <b>the</b> <b>fray,</b> the development phase took longer than expected, causing delays.|$|E

5|$|Ney now had two problems: he {{expected}} support columns from Soult's division on both flanks to arrive momentarily {{and he did}} not know that the Austrians had arrived in force, directly in front of his center.

Around midday Newport's Golden Dragon, followed by Roebuck - bigger than Dainty, but only a fraction of the Madre, joined <b>the</b> <b>fray.</b> These were followed at two-hour intervals by Foresight and Prudence in the evening.

His {{version of the}} story includes the secret marriage, the colluding friar, <b>the</b> <b>fray</b> where a prominent citizen is killed, Mariotto's exile, Gianozza's forced marriage, the potion plot, and the crucial message that goes astray. In this version, Mariotto is caught and beheaded and Gianozza dies of grief.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} for the Legislative Assembly held on 2 April 1955 was a lively and closely fought affair, with several new political parties joining <b>the</b> <b>fray.</b> Unlike previous elections, voters were automatically registered, expanding the electorate to around 300,000. The SPP was soundly {{defeated in the}} election, winning only four seats. The newly formed, left-leaning Labour Front was the biggest winner with ten seats and it formed a coalition government with the UMNO-MCA Alliance, which won three seats. Another new party, the leftist People's Action Party (PAP), won three seats.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Selectivity of {{a number}} of vermiculites, montmorillonites and micas for K and Cs ions was {{determined}} by sorption of these ions from equilibrium solutions of diverse concentrations. The selec-tivity coefficients were related to the layer charge density and the area of <b>the</b> <b>frayed</b> edges in layer silicates. Montmorillonites had the smallest selectivity for the two ions, while biotite and illite had the great-est selectivity. Selectivity of biotite and illite was limited to small concentrations of K, however. At greater concentrations the selectivity of vermiculite for K exceeded the selectivity of the micas. The greater selectivity of vermiculites than montmorillonites for K and Cs ions was attributed to the greater layer charge density in vermiculites. The greater selectivity of micas than montmorillonites and vermiculites was attributed to <b>the</b> <b>frayed</b> edges of micas in addition to their larger layer charge density. As <b>the</b> <b>frayed</b> edRes in illite were increased inarea by removal of the interlayer K, the selec-tivity of illite for K also increased; thus confirming <b>the</b> selectivity of <b>frayed</b> edges for <b>the</b> K ions...|$|R
5|$|The terrain {{complicated}} battle tactics {{for both}} sides, but the Russians and the Austrians, having {{arrived in the}} area first, were able to overcome many of its difficulties by strengthening a causeway between two small ponds. They had also devised a solution to Frederick's deadly modus operandi, the oblique order. Although Frederick's troops initially gained {{the upper hand in}} the battle, the sheer number of Allied troops gave the Russians and Austrians an advantage. By afternoon, when the combatants were exhausted, fresh Austrian troops thrown into <b>the</b> <b>fray</b> secured the Allied victory.|$|E
5|$|This counter-punch drove Murat to {{seek the}} cover of allied Württemberger infantry. Barclay's reinforcements, however, were sent into <b>the</b> <b>fray</b> only to be torn to pieces by French artillery, leaving Friant's Division {{in control of the}} Russian forward {{position}} at 11:30. Dust, smoke, confusion, and exhaustion all combined to keep the French commanders on the field (Davout, Ney, and Murat) from comprehending that all the Russians before them had fallen back, were in confusion, and ripe for the taking.|$|E
5|$|Trollope leapt into <b>the</b> <b>fray</b> {{somewhat}} belatedly, in {{the pages}} of Saint Paul's in October 1869, with an article on the Formosa controversy that can be read as a defence of and an advertisement for The Vicar. He took exception to several of the arguments in The Times: young women of the 1860s, he wrote, were not unaware of the existence of prostitution; and attempting to keep them in ignorance would not conduce to virtue. Rather than promoting vice, an accurate depiction of the squalid and miserable life of a woman of the streets would arm young people to resist temptation.|$|E

40|$|Radioactive caesium (chiefly 137 Cs) {{is a major}} {{environmental}} pollutant. The mobility of Cs in temperate soils is primarily controlled by sorption onto clay minerals, particularly <b>the</b> <b>frayed</b> edges of illite interlayers. This paper investigates the adsorption of Cs to illite at the molecular scale, over both the short and long term. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that after initial absorption into <b>the</b> <b>frayed</b> edges, Cs migrated into the illite interlayer becoming incorporated within the mineral structure. Caesium initially exchanged with hydrated Ca at <b>the</b> <b>frayed</b> edges, causing them to collapse. This process was irreversible as Cs held in the collapsed interlayers was not exchangeable with Ca. Over the long term Cs did not remain {{at the edge of}} the illite crystals, but diffused into the interlayers by exchange with K. Results from extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) and density functional theory modelling confirmed that Cs was incorporated into the illite interlayer and revealed its bonding environment...|$|R
