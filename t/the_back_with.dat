5|$|All {{four men}} began the SMW Tag Team Championship match in the ring. The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) {{controlled}} {{most of the}} opening of the match with aerial maneuvers against The Heavenly Bodies (Jimmy Del Ray and Tom Pritchard). Del Ray tried to help his partner but superkicked him instead. The Heavenly Bodies gained the advantage after Pritchard performed a powerbomb on Morton, which Del Ray followed with a moonsault. Del Ray and Morton fought back and forth, with Del Ray performing another moonsault and Morton executing a hurricanrana. After all four wrestlers brawled in the ring once more, Del Ray hit Gibson in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a tennis racquet. Pritchard then pinned Gibson to win the belts for The Heavenly Bodies.|$|E

5|$|Bajkam {{opened a}} {{campaign}} against al-Baridi in early spring 941. His lieutenants were at first defeated by the Baridis, whereupon Bajkam himself left Wasit to take the field. On his way to join his army, however, he was informed that his generals had achieved a major victory over the Baridis, and {{decided to return to}} Wasit. On 21 April 941, while travelling, he took part in a hunting excursion, during which he and his party inadvertently encountered a band of Kurdish brigands. During a brief skirmish, Bajkam was slain when one of the Kurds stabbed him in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> his lance.|$|E
5|$|Balls Mahoney faced Masato Tanaka in {{the second}} Extreme Rules match of the night. Mahoney got the early {{advantage}} after throwing a beer can {{in the face of}} Tanaka. Tanaka gained the advantage after executing a superplex off the top rope. Mahoney won the match after hitting Tanaka with a steel chair. Before the WWE Championship match, Eugene came to the ring to cut a promo. He reminded the fans that he was Eric Bischoff's nephew, before being interrupted by The Sandman. Sandman hit Eugene repeatedly with his Singapore cane, leaving Eugene to run to <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> The Sandman chasing after him.|$|E
5|$|Distinct {{signs of}} sexual {{dimorphism}} {{are seen in}} the antelope. The male is considerably larger than the female. The females, as well as juveniles, have a rufous coat, whereas the males become yellowish grey or darker {{after the age of}} two years. The male has a prominent black crest of hair on the neck, but this feature is not well-developed in the female. One long white stripe runs along <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> 11–14 white stripes branching towards the sides. The chest has a central black stripe, and there is no throat beard. A black stripe runs from each eye to the nose and a white one from each eye to the centre of the dark face. A chevron is present between the eyes. The area around the lips is white, the throat has white patches, and two white spots appear {{on each side of the}} lower jaw. The underparts are completely white, while the slender legs are tawny and have black and white patches. The lesser kudu is characterised by large, rounded ears. Its tracks are similar to the greater kudu's. Females have four teats. The average lifespan is 10 years in the wild, and 15 years in captivity.|$|E

He then burns Ludwig's body, as he was infected with the spore as well. Trepkos tells Mulder that after Firewalker returned from its first descent, Erickson pulverized a rock {{in one of its}} samples, resulting in his death and the infection of all the scientists immediately surrounding him. Trepkos says that the spore is parasitic in nature, making its hosts pass itself on to others. Meanwhile, in the lab, an infected O'Neil handcuffs herself to Scully to expose her to the spore, forcing Scully to use a hammer to split the chains but to no avail, so she instead protects herself by throwing O'Neil into a sealed chamber and closing the door. A protrusion then bursts out of O'Neil's throat, killing her without spreading the spore to Scully.|$|E

Sixty people, all presumed to have been involved, were detained by Danish law enforcement, while another 19 suffered injuries as a result of the violence.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E

During the match, Triple H choked Batista with a chain and hit him in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a steel chair wrapped with barbed wire. Batista regained the {{momentum}} by grabbing Triple H's sledgehammer and hitting him with it. Batista performed a spinebuster onto the steel steps on Triple H, which was followed with a Batista Bomb for the win to retain the title.

5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Samoa Joe defended the title against the {{challenger}} Booker T. Joe's forehead was cut open during the match after being thrown {{into a pair of}} steel ring steps. Booker T also had his forehead cut open during the contest. Several referees were knocked out by Joe in the storyline throughout the encounter, to the point that security was sent down to the ring to restrain Joe. Booker T's legitimate wife Sharmell then interfered in the bout, attempting to get someone to stop Joe as he applied his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold on Booker T. Sting then entered the arena and went to the ring to calm down Joe, who listened at first, before giving Sting the finger and continuing his assault on Booker T. Sting retaliated by bashing Joe in the gut and over <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a baseball bat. Booker T then covered Joe, while Sharmell counted the pinfall before the two left the arena with the title belt, leaving the outcome a mystery before being ruled a no-contest at 15 minutes and 14 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The opening bout {{was for the}} TNA X Division Championship {{between the}} {{champion}} Petey Williams and the challenger Consequences Creed. The duration of the match was 12 minutes and 30 seconds. Williams was accompanied to the ring by Rhaka Khan, who interfered in the contest trying to aid Williams to no avail. Near {{the end of the}} match, Sheik Abdul Bashir walked out to the ring and bashed Creed across <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a steel chair, which allowed Williams to force Creed's head into the mat with his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver. Williams followed with the pin to win the match and retain the TNA X Division Championship. After the bout, Bashir continued to attack Creed.|$|E

5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> (<b>with</b> some yellow spots) {{all the way to}} the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match, Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) defended their WWF Tag Team Championship against The Mega-Maniacs (Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake). Beefcake wore a protective titanium facemask {{because of his}} injured face, and Hulk Hogan came to the ring with a black eye, which led the announcers to speculate about the cause. Money Inc. gained the early advantage, but DiBiase soon injured himself by hitting Beefcake's mask. Hogan and Beefcake brawled with their enemies and controlled the match until Money Inc. was counted out. Referee Earl Hebner announced, however, that he would strip them of their title {{if they did not}} return to the ring and continue the match. DiBiase returned to the ring and rendered Hogan unconscious with the Million Dollar Dream chokehold. Beefcake attacked DiBiase by applying a sleeper hold and then turned his attention to Schyster, but DiBiase hit him in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> Schyster's briefcase. Money Inc. attacked Beefcake and removed his facemask, but Beefcake fought back and applied a sleeper hold to Schyster. The referee was accidentally knocked unconscious, and Hogan recovered and attacked both members of Money Inc. with Beefcake's facemask. He tried to make the cover for a pinfall, but the referee still unconscious. Manager Jimmy Hart turned his jacket inside-out to reveal a striped referee jacket; he made the three-count and declared The Mega-Maniacs the winners of the match. Referee Danny Davis came to the ring and disqualified Hogan for using the facemask as a weapon. Money Inc. won the match and retained their championship, but The Mega-Maniacs threw them out of the ring and opened Schyster's briefcase to reveal stacks of cash. They celebrated in the ring and threw the money into the crowd.|$|E
5|$|On the November 27 {{episode of}} Raw, The Hardys {{had their first}} shot at Tag Team gold in five years. They took on World Tag Team Champions Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton), but came up short when Edge hit Jeff in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a belt to get himself and Orton {{deliberately}} disqualified to retain the title. That same day, The Hardys posed an open challenge to any team for ECW December to Dismember which was immediately accepted by a reuniting MNM (Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury). After a run in on the intervening ECW on Sci Fi, The Hardys defeated MNM at the pay-per-view, starting a feud between all four men that spanned both brands. The Hardys got their first chance to gain the WWE Tag Team Championship at Armageddon, where the original tag team match was changed to a four team ladder match involving The Hardys, MNM, Dave Taylor and William Regal, and Paul London and Brian Kendrick. Despite coming up short, The Hardys sparked another feud with MNM when Mercury was legitimately injured. While Jeff and Nitro continued battling over the Intercontinental Championship on Raw, Matt and Mercury feuded on SmackDown!. Mercury and Nitro tried injuring both Hardys' faces as payback for what happened at Armageddon, claiming that The Hardys had ruined Mercury's 'Hollywood good looks'. The Hardys settled their feud with MNM at the Royal Rumble when they defeated them for the second time. Matt and Mercury continued feuding, however, which was finally settled at No Way Out.|$|E

5|$|Several {{groups of}} temnospondyls have large bony plates on their backs. One temnospondyl, Peltobatrachus, has armour-like plating that covers both its back and underside. The temnospondyl Laidleria also has {{extensive}} plating on its back. Most {{members of the}} family Dissorophidae also have armor, although it only covers the midline of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> two narrow rows of plates. Other temnospondyls, such as Eryops, have been found with small, disc-like bony scutes that were in life probably embedded in the skin. All of these temnospondyls were adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle. Armor may have offered protection from predators in the case of Peltobatrachus. The scutes may have provided stability for the spine, as they would have limited flexibility and may have been connected by strong ligaments. Temnospondyls, such as Sclerothorax and Eryops, that may have been at least partly terrestrial also have long neural spines on top of their vertebrae that would have stabilized the spine. Bony scutes are also seen in plagiosaurs, but unlike Peltobatrachus, Laidleria, Eryops, and dissorophids, these animals are thought to have been fully aquatic. Plagiosaurs may have inherited their armor from a terrestrial ancestor, as both Peltobatrachus and Laidleria have been considered close relatives of the group.|$|E
5|$|The Four-Way Elimination Tag Team {{match for}} the NWA World Tag Team Championship was next, in which The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens), who were {{accompanied}} by Jimmy Hart, defended against the teams of Alex Shelley and Sean Waltman, America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm), and Team Canada (A-1 and Eric Young). The bout duration was 18 minutes and 1 second. Waltman was advertised to team with Shelley for the encounter, but missed the show due to undisclosed reasons. In this bout, if {{a member of a}} team is pinned or made to submit, then him and his partner is eliminated from the contest; the objective is to be the last team standing. Shelley began the bout alone, until Chris Candido's legitimate brother Johnny Candido, who was in attendance along with several of Candido's family members, jumped the railing to join Shelley as his tag team partner. A bit later, Douglas kicked Candido in the crotch and pinned him with a roll-up pin, thus eliminating Shelley and Candido from the contest. AMW were the next eliminated; Young pinned Harris with a roll-up after A-1 hit Harris across <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a hockey stick. The Naturals pinned A-1 after slamming him into the mat face-first with their signature tag team Natural Disaster maneuver. Due to the pin, Team Canada were eliminated from the contest, thus giving the victory to The Naturals who retained the NWA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{body can}} be divided into three parts – the cephalon (head), the pereon (thorax), and the abdomen. The pereon {{comprises}} most of the length of the body. It is divided into seven segments known as pereonites. The rounded and smooth cephalon is fused to the first pereonite; while the highly reduced and almost invisible abdomen is attached to the posterior of the seventh pereonite. In males the first two pereonites are elongated, with the second pereonite being the longest of all the pereonites. They are densely covered with long setae (bristles), giving them a hairy appearance. The second pereonite also has two to three pairs of spines on <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> an additional two pairs at the sides near the base of the limbs. The remaining pereonites (third to seventh) lack the dense setae of the first two pereonites. The third pereonite has seven pairs of spines at the back while the fourth pereonite has eight pairs. Both have three to seven pairs of spines near the base of the gills. The fifth pereonite has five pairs of back spines and a pair of spines at the sides. The sixth and seventh pereonites each have two pairs of back spines, situated at their centers and near the posterior. Females differ from males in having much shorter pereonites which lack the dense covering of setae. The cephalon and first pereonite also possess a single pair of spines each, though they can sometimes be absent.|$|E

5000|$|Another major {{function}} of the mat in archival framing (where the mats used are made of acid-free and lignin-free paper) comes into play during the mounting process. In archival framing, paper items are not typically glued down to <b>the</b> <b>backing,</b> as it prevents anyone in the future {{from being able to}} safely and easily remove it to replace damaged frames, backing or mats, and can make restoration of a damaged document or art piece more difficult. Typically, such items are instead held in place against <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>with</b> mylar [...] "photo corners" [...] (tiny triangular pockets into which the corners of the paper are put). The added (though slight) weight of mats can help hold a piece in place while also helping to hide <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> and photo corners. In archival framing, the mats are not glued to <b>the</b> piece or <b>backing,</b> but are [...] "hinged" [...] to <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>with</b> tape, though if more than one mat is used, the mats are typically glued to each other.|$|R
