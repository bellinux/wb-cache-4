5|$|Amman has an {{extensive}} road network, although the mountainous <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> {{the area has}} prevented the connection of some main roads, which are instead connected by bridges and tunnels. The Abdoun Bridge spans Wadi Abdoun and connects the 4th Circle to Abdoun Circle. It {{is considered one of}} Amman's many landmarks and is the first curved suspended bridge to be built in the country.|$|E
5|$|Both Memphis and Randolph {{are located}} {{on one of the}} four Chickasaw Bluffs, Randolph on the second and Memphis on the fourth. In the early 19th century, the <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> the Chickasaw Bluffs {{provided}} promising locations for a harbor on the Mississippi River for both emerging towns. In 1820, the area that would become Randolph had an estimated population of 54.|$|E
5|$|Gradual {{weakening}} {{occurred as}} Dot neared Hainan Island on June9. The typhoon subsequently made landfall near Sanya on June10 and weakened to a tropical storm. Later that day, the storm emerged into the Gulf of Tonkin before making its {{third and final}} landfall near Hai Phong, Vietnam. Once onshore, Dot quickly degraded over the mountainous <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> northern Vietnam, and was last noted on June12.|$|E

5|$|Late on October23, {{dramatic}} weakening ensued and Patricia made landfall near Cuixmala, Jalisco, with {{winds of}} 150mph (240km/h). This {{made it the}} strongest landfalling hurricane on record along the Pacific coast of Mexico. Patricia continued to weaken extremely quickly, faster than it had intensified, as it interacted with the mountainous <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> Mexico. Within 24hours of moving ashore, Patricia weakened into a tropical depression and dissipated soon thereafter, late on October24.|$|E

5|$|The mountainous <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> the Chetco River {{watershed}} {{was created}} approximately 130million {{years ago when}} the microcontinent collided with the much larger North American continent. The process uplifted the complex and exotic terranes of the microcontinent to form the Klamath Mountains. Many glaciers carved U-shaped valleys and cirques during the last ice age, and several alpine lakes still exist today.|$|E

5|$|The railway was {{constructed}} by the South Eastern Railway in the early 1850s across the difficult <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> the High Weald.

Rectifications led to a restricted loading gauge along the line, requiring the use of dedicated rolling stock.|$|E
5|$|The <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> {{a barrier}} island is {{determined}} by a dynamic beach system with offshore bars, pounding surf, and shifting beaches; as well as grassy dunes behind the beach, maritime forests with wetlands in the interiors, and salt or tidal marshes on the lee side, facing the mainland.

5|$|With {{the central}} {{government}} collapsing in authority over the various regions of the empire, it was recorded in 845 that bandits and river pirates in parties of 100 or more began plundering settlements along the Yangtze River with little resistance.

5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; bad weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was {{by this time}} so ill that he thought it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler {{was not the only}} one falling ill; the bad weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> Île-aux-Noix was also taking a toll on the troops, as more of them became ill as well. The bad news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E
5|$|Farther inland, Arlene {{turned to}} the west-southwest along the {{building}} ridge. The storm decreased in strength upon doing so; its mid- and low-level circulations became increasingly decoupled, with the latter turning elongated and ill-defined. Early on July1, the NHC downgraded Arlene to a tropical depression, and the cyclone dissipated over the high <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> the Sierra Madre Mountains shortly thereafter. Arlene's remnants continued to produce heavy precipitation over central Mexico, and with high air pressures offshore a tight pressure gradient generated a strong easterly breeze along the country's Pacific coastlines.|$|E
5|$|High {{mortality}} {{rates have been}} recorded in the Serengeti. In a 1994 study, nearly 77% of litters died before eight weeks of birth, and nearly 83% of those alive could not make it to adolescence (14weeks). Lions emerged as the major predator of juveniles, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. The study concluded that the survival rate of cubs till weaning was a mere 4.8%. This was attributed to the open <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> the region, which does not allow cheetahs to conceal themselves. Cheetah cubs face higher mortality than most other large mammals.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Lane {{continued}} to organize with its 9mile (14km) wide eye surrounded by very deep convection, and the storm strengthened further to reach peak winds of 125mph (205km/h) by midday on September 16. It turned unexpectedly {{to the northeast}} , and at 1915UTC on the 16th, Hurricane Lane made landfall in a sparsely populated region of Sinaloa, 20miles (32km) southeast of El Dorado. This made Lane the most intense hurricane to strike Mexico since Hurricane Kenna in the 2002 season. The combination of the mountainous <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> Mexico and increasing west-southwesterly wind shear caused the storm to rapidly weaken, and the storm dissipated on September 17. The remnants of Lane later moved into Texas, United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Phleps was {{transferred}} to the 11th Feldjäger (rifle) Battalion in Güns (in modern-day Hungary), and in 1905 was accepted into the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt. He completed his studies in two years, and was endorsed as suitable for service in the General Staff. Following promotion to Oberleutnant (first lieutenant) he transferred to the staff of the 13th Infantry Regiment at Esseg in Slavonia, and then the 6th Infantry Division in Graz. This was followed by a promotion to Hauptmann (captain) in 1911 along with a position {{on the staff of the}} XV Army Corps in Sarajevo, where he specialised in mobilisation and communications in the difficult <b>terrain</b> <b>of</b> Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
