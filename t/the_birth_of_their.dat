5|$|Although the {{marriage}} had been strained from the beginning, Teresa Cristina continued striving to {{be a good}} wife. Her constancy toward fulfilling her duty, along with the birth of children, softened PedroII's attitude. The two discovered shared interests, and their concern for and delight in their children created a sense of family happiness. That they were sexually active and compatible is witnessed by the series of pregnancies which ensued. After <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first son in February 1845, the Empress bore children in July 1846, July 1847, and July 1848—named Afonso, Isabel, Leopoldina and Pedro, respectively.|$|E

He joined the staff of Philadelphia's Daily Standard and began to build {{his reputation as a}} literary critic, becoming known for his savagery and vindictiveness.|$|E
50|$|Economists {{and critics}} {{also argue that}} the {{allowance}} creates shifting birth patterns. In December 2006, media reports suggested that German parents were seeking ways to delay <b>the</b> <b>births</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> children until 1 January 2007, {{so that they would}} gain access to Elterngeld of up to 25,200 euros (two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>their</b> former salary for up to a year), up from 7,200 euros per annum.|$|R

They could have asked them to pay fines and that way they could have kept the families together, but they didn't do that." ...|$|R

Sadly, their son (The Prince Tuku'aho) would pass away in 1936. However, the other two sons (The Prince Taufa'ahau and The Prince Sione) carried and passed on the {{combined}} bloodlines of the three ancient royal dynasties.|$|R
5000|$|The {{structure}} of US justice systems makes development of maternal attachment nearly impossible. After <b>the</b> <b>births</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> children, {{many women are}} returned to the jail or prison, and their infant immediately enters foster or kinship care. [...] However, within many state policies, relatives are given less financial support, which can leave foster care to be more viable than kinship placement. [...] "For 50% of all incarcerated mothers, this separation becomes a lifelong sentence of permanent separation between mothers and their children." ...|$|R
5|$|Medical issues forced Schweitzer {{to leave}} Africa many times, and {{sometimes}} Albert {{kept her from}} returning at times. When Albert {{decided to return to}} Africa in 1924, he took on Oxford undergraduate, Noel Gillespie, as assistant, leaving Schweitzer behind. After <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> daughter (Rhena Schweitzer Miller), Schweitzer was no longer able to live in Lambaréné owing to her health.

Myrtle subsequently recovered from chronic tuberculosis and attributed her recovery to her use of prayer and other methods learned in Weeks's classes. Subsequently Charles began to heal from his childhood accident, a development which he too attributed to following this philosophy. Charles Fillmore became a devoted student of philosophy and religion.|$|R
25|$|After <b>the</b> <b>births</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> children, Victoria Eugenie's {{relationship}} with Alfonso deteriorated, {{and he had}} numerous affairs. It {{has been said that}} he had a dalliance with the Queen's cousin, Beatrice, Duchess of Galliera, but this is disputed. There is some evidence that Alfonso tried to seduce Beatrice, but she didn't give in. The king, in anger, expelled her and her husband from Spain. Then members of the king's circle spread rumours that Beatrice had been expelled because of her bad behaviour, which was not true. All this situation was very painful for the Queen, who could do nothing to help her cousin.|$|R
