40|$|Objective　To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} low dose γ-ray on the gene expression of cyclin G 1 (CCNG 1) in human lymphoblasts AHH- 1 line and the probability of CCNG 1 as bio-dosimeter for low-dose radiation. Methods　Lymphoblasts of AHH- 1 line were irradiated with γ-ray in the doses of 0, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 5, 0. 8 or 1. 0 Gy. Total RNA of cells was extracted at 0, 4, 24, 48, 72 and 168 h after irradiation, and real-time Q-PCR was used to detect the expression of CCNG 1 gene in AHH- 1 cells. The relationship between the irradiation dosage or duration and the gene expression was analyzed. Results　The gene expression of CCNG 1 in AHH- 1 cells increased in a dose-dependent manner after irradiation, presenting a better dose-effect relationship. <b>Time-effect</b> <b>curve</b> indicated that the peak expression of CCNG 1 appeared at 24 h after irradiation, and then the expression decreased gradually with time, and it recovered to the level before irradiation at 168 h after irradiation. Conclusions　CCNG 1 gene is sensitive to low dose irradiation (0 - 1. 0 Gy) with a better dose and time-effect relationship, {{and it may be}} used as a potential efficient biological dosimetry in low dose exposure risk assessment.

40|$|The effects {{produced}} when presumably {{inert substances}} (e. g., lactose and saline) {{are given to}} normal and diseased individuals are appreciated by many. Few physicians would deny {{the power of a}} placebo to influence pain, anxiety, or other "subjective " states in certain individuals; the ability of placebos to affect "objective " phenomena (such as vomiting) or to produce "side effects " of various sorts has also been reported (1 - 3). This article is an attempt to describe certain lesser known aspects of the "pharmacology " of the placebo by depicting, in some detail, {{the ways in which the}} clinical use of inert substances may lead to effects which are usually considered to be the exclusive property of active agents. Certain implications of the data will be discussed. METHODS AND RESULTS <b>Time-effect</b> <b>curve</b> in single dose experiments One of the basic indices of pharmacologic ac-tivity is the time-effect relationship. When an active drug is given to patients, a maximal effect is typically achieved at a certain point in time. It is not widely appreciated that placebos can also show this behavior. In Figure 1 are plotted some data obtained in a study of the effects of aspirin or a placebo on postpartum pain. One hundred and twenty-eight patients were studied in an obstetrical ward dur-ing the five day period following delivery.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{impact of}} the {{polymorphic}} amino acids 16 and 27 of the beta 2 -adrenoceptor (beta 2 -AR) on the susceptibility to bronchodilator tolerance remains unclear since clinical studies thus far have shown discordant results. Tolerance towards the effects of inhaled beta 2 -AR agonists generally is more easily shown for systemic parameters than for airway effects and can be substantial. This study evaluates whether differences exist between position 16 homozygous genotyped asthmatics, in tolerance development towards airway responses and the systemic effect hypokalemia. METHODS: Twenty patients were genotyped for amino acids 16 and 27 of the beta 2 -AR gene. Time-effect curves for FEV 1 and serum potassium concentration were constructed after s. c. administration of terbutaline after two-week treatment periods with either terbutaline inhalation or matching placebo in a double-blind, randomised and cross-over design. Statistical analysis was done by a repeated measures multivariate analysis on area under <b>time-effect</b> <b>curve</b> (AUC). MAIN RESULTS: Pre-treatment with inhaled terbutaline did not influence the improvement in FEV 1 in response to s. c. terbutaline {{and there were no}} significant differences between Arg- 16 and Gly- 16 individuals in this respect. Pre-treatment with inhaled terbutaline resulted in an overall increase of baseline plasma potassium before administration of s. c. terbutaline (3. 78 - 3. 95 mmol/L, p= 0. 034). However, this effect appeared to be solely confined to the Arg- 16 homozygous individuals, leading to a statistically highly significant difference between the Arg- 16 and Gly- 16 subjects (p= 0. 005). However, there was no genotype related difference in the decrease in plasma potassium response to s. c. terbutaline relative to baseline. CONCLUSION: In patients carrying the Arg- 16 genotype the development of hypokalemia by s. c. terbutaline is attenuated after pre-treatment with inhaled terbutaline, be it on the basis of higher baseline value...|$|E

40|$|The potent and {{selective}} D 2 -agonist N- 0437 [2 -(N-propyl-N- 2 -thienylethylamino) - 5 -hydroxytetralin] undergoes considerable first-pass metabolism after oral administration due to glucuronidation of the phenolic group. In {{an attempt to}} improve its bioavailability, seven ester prodrugs of N- 0437 were sythesized, i. e the acetyl-, propionyl-, isobutyryl-, pivaloyl-, 2 -aminophenyl 2 -methoxy-phenyl- and 2, 4 -dimethylphenyl-analogues. In vivo activities were assessed by measuring contralateral turning after transdermal administration of N- 0437 and its prodrugs to rats with unilateral 6 -OHDA lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway, From <b>time-effect</b> <b>curves</b> the area under the curve for separate time intervals was taken {{as a measure of}} dopaminergic activity during that interval. It was found that slowly hydrolyzing prodrugs, which are known to show an improved duration of action after oral administration, are devoid of activity after transdermal application.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Time-dependence of {{cisplatin}} (CDDP) and oxaliplatin (L-OHP) cytotoxic {{effects in}} A 431 and A 431 /Pt cells (sensitive and CDDP-resistant human cervical tumor cells) were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The drug application modes were pulse (12. 5, 25 or 50 microM up to 72 h) and pulse-plus-chase (50 microM for 2, 4 or 6 h, followed by washing and 72 h-incubation in drug-free medium). RESULTS: In the A 431 cells, the pulse drug application showed <b>time-effect</b> <b>curves</b> with two plateaux; the inhibitory activity of CDDP {{was higher than}} that of L-OHP. The same growth-inhibition fraction was reached by L-OHP in a longer time than CDDP. In the A 431 /Pt cells, the curve shapes for both drugs were similar in both application modes and had the same general characteristics, noted in the parental cell line. CDDP appeared less active than L-OHP. CONCLUSION: Different cytotoxicity curves of Pt-drugs could be dictated by the presence of the bulky diaminocyclohexane (DACH) ligand, affecting the kinetics of Pt-DNA binding; mismatch repair (MSH 2) protein is involved in the resistance...|$|R
40|$|Adenosine is a neuromodulator {{which is}} {{involved}} in a multitude of both physiological and pathological mechanisms in the body. Within the CNS, adenosine {{plays an important role in}} the regulation of motor processes and behaviour. Its biological effects are mediated through interaction with one of four G protein-coupled, membrane-bound receptor subtypes currently known as A 1, A 2 A, A 2 B and A 3. The adenosine A 1 and A 2 A receptors predominate in the brain whereas the adenosine A 2 A receptors are mainly located in the striatum. In the striatum, the adenosine A 2 A receptors antagonistically interact with colocalized dopamine D 2 receptors. A degeneration of the striatum with a progressive depletion of dopamine leads to the clinical situation of Parkinson´s Disease. This disease belongs to the most common neurodegenerative disorders in Germany. The motor impairment which comes along with this disease can be improved with adenosine A 2 A receptor antagonists. In addition to this antiparkinsonian effect, animal models of depression also indicate an antidepressant effect of these compounds. Depression is a psychiatric disease with a high prevalence within the population. In European countries, 5 10 % of the population is affected. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie human depression are not yet completely understood. Besides the involvement of serotonine and noradrenaline, dopamine also seems to play an important role. The goal of this project was to investigate the effect of three adenosine receptor antagonists of different subtypselectivity to the adenosine A 2 A receptors in the Haloperidol-induced catalepsy, an animal model for Parkinson´s disease, and in two animal models of depression, namely the Forced Swim Test and the Olfactory Bulbectomy. The substances used in this project were the unselective adenosine receptor antagonist Theophylline, the moderately selective elbion substance A and the highly selective KW 6002. 	 In the Haloperidol-induced catalepsy, a possible correlation of the anticataleptic effect and the level of subtypselectivity of the investigated adenosine receptor antagonists was examined in addition to the <b>time-effect</b> <b>curve.</b> All three substances led to a clear reduction of the Haloperidol-induced catalepsy in the mouse and the rat. Differences in the level of effect and its duration were produced by pharmacokinetic parameters rather than the level of subtypselectivity. 	 The anticataleptic effective compounds were then examined for an antidepressant effect in the Forced Swim Test in mice. The examined dosages of all three adenosine receptor antagonists revealed an antidepressant effect by significantly reducing the immobility time. This antidepressant effect was further investigated in the Olfactory Bulbectomy in rats, a valid animal model of depression. The removal of the olfactory bulbs induces numerous neurochemical, neuroendocrine and neuroimmune changes and also changes in the rats' behaviour. So bulbectomized rats show hyperactivity in a new, aversive environment. Paralleling the clinical situation in humans, this behavioural feature is reversed only by chronic treatment with antidepressants and not after acute treatment like in the Forced Swim Test. The adenosine receptor antagonists were applied to the animals for fifteen days. The antidepressant effect of the adenosine receptor antagonists that could be observed in the Forced Swim Test could not be seen in the Olfactory Bulbectomy. Unlike Imipramine and Amitriptyline, the two reference compounds, the treatment with adenosine receptor antagonists did not attenuate the hyperactivity of the bulbectomized rats. Theophylline (30 mg/kg b. w. p. o. sid), elbion substance A (30 mg/kg b. w. p. o. bid) and KW 6002 (10 mg/kg p. o. sid) further increased the locomotor activity of the bulbectomized rats. A statistically significant effect however was only achieved after treatment with elbion substance A. In the sham-operated animals, treatment with Theophylline and KW 6002 also led to an increase in locomotor activity in the Open Field. Due to this stimulative effect of adenosine A 2 A receptor antagonists an antidepressant efficacy of the adenosine receptor antagonists in the Forced Swim Test should be evaluated cautiously. It is possible that the antidepressant effect in the Forced Swim Test reveals a false positive result. The Olfactory Bulbectomy is mainly used as an animal model for agitated depression. The likelihood is that it is not the adequate model for detecting an antidepressant efficacy of motor stimulating compounds. A false negative antidepressant effect of the investigated adenosine receptor antagonists in this model seems to be likely. Clinical studies in patients with different forms of depression should show whether adenosine A 2 A receptor antagonists are suitable for an antidepressant treatment especially of the inhibited depression...|$|E
40|$|The in-vivo {{activities}} of eight carbamate prodrugs of the D 2 -agonist N- 0437 {{were determined by}} examining {{the effects of the}} prodrugs, after their oral administration in rats with unilateral 6 -OHDA lesions of the striatum. The resulting contralateral turning was used as an index of the activity of the compounds. A comparison of the area under the <b>curve</b> of the <b>time-effect</b> <b>curves</b> of the prodrugs, revealed a significantly improved duration of action compared with N- 0437 during the period 11 - 15 h after administration, for the propylcarbamate and the dimethoxyphenylcarbamate derivatives. The 2, 4 -dimethylphenylcarbamate showed a significantly enhanced turning behaviour over the whole 15 h time interval in comparison with N- 0437. Three of the nine carbamates were virtually unhydrolysed in rat serum at 37 -degrees-C, while the other test compounds were hydrolysed relatively slowly, with t 1 / 2 values ranging from 1. 5 - 6 h. The test compounds differed greatly in partition coefficients, which were estimated by RP-HPLC (1 - 12 times more lipophilic than N- 0437). The potential cholinesterase inhibiting properties of the carbamate prodrugs were assessed by a simple in-vitro incubation assay, which showed that only two carbamates were very weak cholinesterase inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Previous studies {{conducted}} in our laboratory indicated that administration of amphetamine, fluoxetine or sibutramine affects the sympathetic nervous system of the rat vas deferens. Therefore, {{our goal was to}} verify the role of calcium in vasa deferentia from young rats pretreated with a single dose of these drugs. Young 40 -day-old male Wistar rats were pretreated with amphetamine 3 mg/kg, fluoxetine 10 mg/kg or sibutramine 6 mg/kg for 4 h before the experiments. CaCl 2 (10 mM) was used to induce contraction through <b>time-effect</b> <b>curves</b> in calcium-free solution to measure phasic and tonic components. We also evaluated the calcium-induced fluorescence of vas deferens cut into thin slices. in rats pretreated with amphetamine, we found an increase of the tonic contraction component which was reduced by verapamil. the phasic and tonic responses were increased in the group treated with fluoxetine, but only the tonic response was more sensitive to the antagonism by verapamil. the group treated with sibutramine showed an increase of phasic response whereas the tonic component was decreased. in this group an increase of the affinity for verapamil antagonism was found. in the calcium fluorescence study it was observed that the group treated with amphetamine, fluoxetine or sibutramine showed higher basal Ca 2 + fluorescence after stimulus with KCl (70 mM), noradrenaline (10 (- 4) M) or acetylcholine (10 - 4 M). in all pretreated groups the calcium fluorescence was diminished by nifedipine 10 (- 7) M. Therefore, the pretreatment with amphetamine, fluoxetine or sibutramine seems to affect the calcium contractility and homeostasis in young rat vas deferens. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) -related painful sensory neuropathies primarily consist of the HIV infection-related distal sensory polyneuropathy and antiretroviral toxic neuropathies. Pharmacotherapy provides only partial relief {{of pain in}} patients with HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome because {{little is known about}} the exact neuropathological mechanisms for HIV-associated neuropathic pain (NP). Hypofunction of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) GABAergic inhibitory mechanisms has been reported after peripheral nerve injury. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HIV gp 120 combined with antiretroviral therapy reduces spinal GABAergic inhibitory tone and that restoration of GABAergic inhibitory tone will reduce HIV-related NP in a rat model. METHODS: The application of recombinant HIV- 1 envelope protein gp 120 into the sciatic nerve plus systemic ddC (one antiretroviral drug) induced mechanical allodynia. The hind paws of rats were inoculated with replication-defective herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors genetically encoding gad 1 gene to express glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD 67), an enzyme that catalyzes the decarboxylation of glutamate to GABA. Mechanical threshold was tested using von Frey filaments before and after treatments with the vectors. The expression of GAD 67 in both the lumbar spinal cord and the L 4 - 5 dorsal root ganglia was examined using western blots. The expression of mitochondrial superoxide in the spinal dorsal horn was examined using MitoSox imaging. The immunoreactivity of spinal GABA, pCREB, and pC/EBPβ was tested using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In the gp 120 with ddC-induced neuropathic pain model, GAD 67 expression mediated by the HSV vector caused an elevation of mechanical threshold that was apparent on day 3 after vector inoculation. The antiallodynic effect of the single HSV vector inoculation expressing GAD 67 lasted > 28 days. The area under the <b>time-effect</b> <b>curves</b> in the HSV vector expressing GAD 67 was increased compared with that in the control vectors (P = 0. 0005). Intrathecal GABA-A/B agonists elevated mechanical threshold in the pain model. The HSV vectors expressing GAD 67 reversed the lowered GABA immunoreactivity in the spinal dorsal horn in the neuropathic rats. HSV vectors expressing GAD 67 in the neuropathic rats reversed the increased signals of mitochondrial superoxide in the spinal dorsal horn. The vectors expressing GAD 67 reversed the upregulated immunoreactivity expression of pCREB and pC/EBPβ in the spinal dorsal horn in rats exhibiting NP. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we suggest that GAD 67 mediated by HSV vectors acting through the suppression of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and transcriptional factors in the spinal cord decreases pain in the HIV-related neuropathic pain model, providing preclinical evidence for gene therapy applications in patients with HIV-related pain states. 博士（医学）旭川医科大...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Clinical SciencesMike D. ApleyLameness is a common, costly, {{and painful}} affliction in cattle at all {{production}} levels. There are currently no compounds specifically approved for analgesia in cattle in the United States. We hypothesized that intra-articular amphotericin B produces a controlled, transient synovitis-arthritis in cattle {{and that this}} model would allow characterization of the analgesic effects of intravenous sodium salicylate. This study examined the efficacy of sodium salicylate for providing analgesia in an amphotericin B-induced bovine synovitis/arthritis model utilizing ten male Holstein calves, 4 - 6 months old, and weighing approximately 250 kg. The study used a repeated measures partial cross-over design with 2 phases consisting of 3 treatment periods within each phase. Calves were blocked by weight and randomly assigned to sodium salicylate (50 mg/kg intravenously) or placebo group for phase 1. In period 1, lameness induction was simulated with a needle-prick of the coronary band, followed by drug or placebo administration. At predetermined timepoints, serial blood samples for cortisol and salicylate concentrations, electrodermal activity measurements, heart rates, and pressure mat data were collected. Visual lameness scores were recorded by a blinded observer. In period 2, lameness was induced with injection of amphotericin B into the distal interphalangeal joint followed by drug or placebo administration with sample collection as previously described. In period 3, drug or placebo was administered to the respective calves with sample collection. After a 10 -day washout, Phase 2 was conducted with treatments crossed over between groups. Cortisol and salicylate samples were analyzed by competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay and fluorescence polarization immunoassay, respectively. The pharmacokinetic {{data were analyzed using}} compartmental analysis. Mean intravenous salicylate apparent volume of distribution (V[subscript]d) was 0. 2 ± 0. 005 L/kg, total body clearance (CL[subscript]B) was 4. 3 ± 0. 2 mL/min*kg, and elimination half life (T[subscript] 1 / 2 el) was 36. 9 ± 1. 2 minutes. The repeated measures data were analyzed based on a univariate split-plot approach with a random effects-mixed model. Differences in stance phase duration and serum cortisol concentration values were seen between both periods and treatment group*periods; differences in heart rate, contact surface area, and contact pressure values were seen between periods, suggesting that our lameness model was effective. No differences were seen between treatment groups. When analyzed by visual lameness score, differences were seen in heart rate, contact surface area, contact pressure, and cortisol concentrations. Area under the <b>time-effect</b> <b>curves,</b> determined using the trapezoidal rule, had results similar to the repeated measures data, except for a difference in period for electrodermal activity. This amphoterecin B-induced synovitis/arthritis model is a useful tool for studying changes associated with lameness in cattle.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{study the}} daily {{administration}} times of Canhuang tablet (CHT) for treating jaundice in rats {{based on a}} pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic model. MethodsRats were modeled by 4 % 1 -Naphthylisothiocyanate (75 mg/kg, p. o.). After 48 h, CHT was given (p. o.) at 0. 75 g/kg once a day, 0. 375 g/kg twice a day, and 0. 25 g/kg three times a day. Blood was collected from the orbital sinus at different intervals. Levels of liver enzymes and bilirubin were detected using these blood samples. Bile was collected and determined after the first administration of CHT. High-performance liquid chromatography {{was used to determine}} the concentration of berberine in bile simultaneously. <b>Time-effect</b> and time-dose <b>curves</b> were then obtained. ResultsCompared with rats taking CHT twice and three times a day, the total amount of bile within 10 h of rats taking CHT once a day were 1. 32 - and 1. 47 -fold higher, respectively. There was good consistency between the pharmacokinetics of berberine and the pharmacodynamics of the effect on liver enzymes and bilirubin in vivo. The pharmacokinetic analyses showed that rats administered CHT once daily maintained a higher concentration of berberine in bile for a longer period than rats administered CHT two- and three-times daily. ConclusionIn jaundiced rats, taking CHT once a day is better than taking CHT twice or three times a day. These data may provide a reference for the clinical application of CHT...|$|R
