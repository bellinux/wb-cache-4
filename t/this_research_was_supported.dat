50|$|Women {{may also}} {{have a number of}} postcopulatory adaptations to sperm competition. The female orgasm has been {{suggested}} as such an adaptation. Physiologically, some researchers have suggested that females may strategically time orgasms in order to selectively retain sperm from extra-pair partners, and <b>this</b> <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> by evidence that women tend to have a greater number of copulatory orgasms with males of higher genetic quality, measured by lower fluctuating asymmetry of the partners. Psychologically, the female orgasm may be used as a mechanism to signal relationship satisfaction with a partner to reduce the likelihood of him having extra-pair copulations. Indeed, women who suspect infidelity of their partners have been shown to report pretending orgasm more frequently than women who do not suspect infidelity.|$|E

5000|$|Connected {{learning}} {{has been a}} term used in research since the early 1990s. The original usages piggybacked {{on the concept of}} connected knowing, which emphasized the importance of context in the development of knowledge for women. Many articles from this time used the term connected learning in reference to hands-on education like fieldwork or internships which is tied to the concept of learning in context. The early research that used the term connected learning also shared the common theme of sociality being important to learning outcomes. From 2000, the term connected learning began to be used in research publications to refer variously to project-based, networked, social, and information-age learning.Cronwell and Cronwell created the first [...] "framework and an organizing set of principles to guide educational research and development," [...] (p. 17). <b>This</b> <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> by the Center for Internet Research.
