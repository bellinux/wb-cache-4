5|$|The bridge's Whipple truss {{technology}} {{was developed by}} civil engineer Squire Whipple in 1847. J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 by designing the first <b>truss</b> <b>bridge</b> with pinned eyebar connections. The design of the Capon Lake Whipple <b>Truss</b> <b>Bridge</b> incorporates Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections and horizontal chords, and is therefore considered a Whipple–Murphy <b>truss</b> <b>bridge.</b> The Capon Lake Whipple <b>Truss</b> <b>Bridge</b> is West Virginia's oldest remaining example of a Whipple <b>truss</b> <b>bridge</b> and its oldest extant metal <b>truss</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Capon Lake Whipple <b>Truss</b> <b>Bridge</b> was {{originally}} constructed in 1874 {{as part of}} the South Branch Bridge (or alternatively, the Romney Bridge), a larger two-span Whipple <b>truss</b> <b>bridge</b> conveying the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) across the South Branch Potomac River near Romney. The larger Whipple <b>truss</b> <b>bridge</b> replaced an 1838 wooden covered bridge that was destroyed during the American Civil War. In 1874, T. B. White and Sons were charged with the construction of a Whipple <b>truss</b> <b>bridge</b> over the South Branch; that bridge served travelers along the Northwestern Turnpike for 63 years until a new bridge was constructed in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Dismantled in 1937, {{the bridge}} was {{relocated}} to Capon Lake in southeastern Hampshire County to carry Capon Springs Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 16) between West Virginia Route 259 and Capon Springs. The bridge was dedicated on August 20, 1938. In 1991, a new bridge was completed to the south, and the Capon Lake Whipple <b>Truss</b> <b>Bridge</b> was preserved {{in place by the}} West Virginia Division of Highways, due to its rarity, age, and engineering significance. The Capon Lake Whipple <b>Truss</b> <b>Bridge</b> was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 15, 2011.|$|E

5|$|The {{technological}} design advances made by Whipple and Murphy, {{in addition}} to further advances in steel and iron fabrication, made wrought iron truss bridges a major industry in the United States. The Capon Lake bridge was a Whipple–Murphy <b>truss</b> <b>bridge,</b> since it incorporated Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections and horizontal chords. At {{the time of the}} bridge's original fabrication in 1874, metal truss bridges were ordered from catalogs by county courts and other entities responsible for transportation construction and maintenance. These entities provided the desired width, length, and other specifications, and the truss materials were shipped to the construction site and assembled by local construction teams. Metal truss bridges were more economically feasible, could span longer distances, and were simpler to construct than stone bridges, and they were more durable than wooden bridges. They were also marketed as detachable and transportable structures that could be dismantled and reassembled. The technology used in the Capon Lake Whipple <b>Truss</b> <b>Bridge</b> revolutionized transport throughout West Virginia. While the Whipple <b>truss</b> <b>bridge</b> had waned in popularity by the 1890s, the bridges were commonly disassembled and re-erected for use on secondary roads, {{as was the case with}} the Capon Lake Whipple <b>Truss</b> <b>Bridge</b> in 1938.|$|E
5|$|The bridge's Whipple truss {{technology}} {{was developed in}} 1847 by civil engineer Squire Whipple, who received a patent from the U.S. Patent Office the same year. Whipple {{was one of the}} first structural engineers to use scientific and mathematical methods analyzing the forces and stresses in framed structures to design the bridge, and his groundbreaking 1847 book, A Work on Bridge Building, had a significant influence on bridge engineering. Whipple's <b>truss</b> <b>bridge</b> design incorporated double-intersection diagonals into the standard Pratt truss, thus allowing the diagonals to extend across two truss bays. Engineer J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 when he designed the first <b>truss</b> <b>bridge</b> with pinned eyebar connections, which utilized pins instead of trunnions. Murphy's design removed the need for riveted connections and allowed for easier and more widespread construction of truss bridges. In 1863, Murphy designed the first pin-connected <b>truss</b> <b>bridge</b> with both wrought iron tension and compression components and cast iron joint blocks and pedestals. Murphy's truss design consisted of double-intersection counter-diagonals, and along with the eyebar and pin connections, permitted longer iron bridge spans.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{planning}} {{started in}} March 1990, {{and at first}} two technical methods for constructing the pontoon bridge were considered: a continuous concrete floating caisson between the abutments, and a steel version incorporating a <b>truss</b> <b>bridge</b> carrying concrete pontoons. However, they were both rejected {{in favor of a}} concrete or steel box section borne on concrete pontoons.|$|E

5|$|Abbotsford Bridge is a steel Allan truss-type bridge {{spanning}} the Murray River between Curlwaa, New South Wales, and Yelta, Victoria. It {{is the only}} remaining steel <b>truss</b> <b>bridge</b> with a lift span that crosses the Murray. Opened in 1928, the bridge was built by the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Public Works and was designed by Percy Allan. It was the second last lift-span bridge to be built over the river, the last being the Nyah Bridge, which opened in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{construction}} in 1874, the Whipple <b>truss</b> <b>bridge</b> over the South Branch Potomac River served Romney and travelers along the Northwestern Turnpike for 63 years. In 1935, the West Virginia State Road Commission began organizing {{a project to}} replace the Whipple <b>truss</b> <b>bridge,</b> and construction of the new bridge had begun by 1936. In November of that year, a car collided with {{the south side of}} the eastern Whipple truss span, which knocked the span completely off its eastern abutment. The car plunged into the South Branch Potomac River, followed by the compromised truss span, which collapsed on top of the car. Unaware of the span's collapse, a car traveling from the west drove off the end of the west span at the bridge's center pier, and fell onto the collapsed span. According to the Hampshire Review, the only serious injury sustained was a broken wooden leg. Following the collapse of the eastern Whipple truss span, a temporary wooden span was hastily constructed between the western truss span and the eastern abutment, so that traffic was uninterrupted until the new bridge was completed and opened on June 21, 1937. The 1937 bridge was used until 2010 when it was replaced by the current South Branch Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Other bridges {{have also}} been built over Little Fishing Creek. A steel <b>truss</b> <b>bridge</b> was built over it in 1896. A bridge {{carrying}} Pennsylvania Route 254 over the creek was built in 1930 and a bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 42 over the creek was built in 1939, as was one other bridge. Five other bridges {{were built in the}} 1940s and 1950s, including another bridge built in 1955 and carrying Pennsylvania Route 42. Several more bridges were built in the 1960s.

5|$|The Pond Eddy Bridge is a petit <b>truss</b> <b>bridge</b> {{spanning}} the Delaware River between the hamlet of Pond Eddy in Lumberland, New York and the settlement informally called Pond Eddy in Shohola Township, Pennsylvania. It is accessible from NY 97 in Lumberland on the New York side and two dead-end local roads, Flagstone Road (State Route 1011) and Rosa Road on the Pennsylvania side. The bridge {{was built in}} 1903 by the Oswego Bridge Company to replace an old suspension bridge that had washed away in a flood earlier in the year.

At Alden Avenue, the route curves to the northeast, mirroring the curvature of the river through Warrensburg. It continues along the waterway to the junction of Ridge and River Streets, where NY418 turns north onto Richards Avenue and finally crosses the river on a <b>truss</b> <b>bridge.</b> The route meets Water Street (CR9) on {{the opposite}} bank before continuing northward past several commercial properties {{to the center of}} Warrensburg, where NY418 ends at an intersection with US9 (Main Street).|$|E
50|$|<b>Truss</b> <b>bridges</b> {{became a}} {{common type of}} bridge built from the 1870s through the 1930s. Examples of these bridges still remain across the US, but their numbers are {{dropping}} rapidly, as they are demolished and replaced with new structures. As metal slowly started to replace timber, wrought iron bridges in the US started being built {{on a large scale}} in the 1870s. Bowstring <b>truss</b> <b>bridges</b> were a common truss design during this time, with their arched top chords. Companies like the Massillon Bridge Company of Massillon, Ohio and the King Bridge Company of Cleveland, Ohio became well-known, as they marketed their designs to cities and townships. The bowstring truss design (photo) fell out of favor {{due to a lack of}} durability, and gave way to the Pratt truss design, which was stronger. Again, the bridge companies marketed their designs, with the Wrought Iron Bridge Company in the lead. As the 1880s and 1890s progressed, steel began to replace wrought iron as the preferred material. Other truss designs were used during this time, including the camel-back. By the 1910s, many states developed standard plan <b>truss</b> <b>bridges,</b> including steel Warren pony <b>truss</b> <b>bridges.</b> As the 1920s and 1930s progressed, some states, such as Pennsylvania, continued to build steel <b>truss</b> <b>bridges,</b> including massive steel through-truss bridges for long spans. Other states, such as Michigan, used standard plan concrete girder and beam bridges, and only a limited number of <b>truss</b> <b>bridges</b> were built.|$|R

5|$|Safety {{improvements}} {{continued in}} the 1990s. A five-mile (8km) stretch just west of Aspen was resurfaced in 1991. A special skid-resistant treatment {{was added to the}} areas that receive no sun in the winter due to shade from Shale Bluffs. The next year, in 1992, three two-year projects began expanding Highway 82 to four lanes between Carbondale and Basalt, including the new bypass. An old <b>truss</b> <b>bridge</b> near Wingo Junction was replaced in 1995; it was followed over the remainder of the decade by widening most of the remaining sections between Basalt and Aspen. At the Maroon Creek Bridge outside Aspen, a pedestrian bridge was built to the north to take foot traffic off the older bridge in an effort to relieve congestion.|$|E
5|$|The plank {{road was}} {{operational}} for about 38 years when a major flood on June 1, 1889 washed out much of it. The flood also destroyed the canal at the creek's mouth. The same storm system caused the Johnstown Flood, which killed over 2200 people. The Cogan House Covered Bridge {{was the only}} one on Larrys Creek to survive the flood, as a fallen tree formed a protective dam just upstream. The 90foot (27m) long Burr arch <b>truss</b> <b>bridge</b> was built in 1877, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, rehabilitated in 1998, and is today one of just three left in the county.|$|E
5|$|In September 1859 local {{residents}} formed a {{committee for the}} construction of a pile bridge over the Murrumbidgee River. After the New South Wales Government refused to support this type of bridge the committee decided to finance it themselves. The bridge was completed in October 1862 and opened on 27 October at just over 91 metres long and 7 metres wide. In 1884 the New South Wales Government purchased the bridge and it was demolished in 1895. In 1895 a <b>truss</b> <b>bridge</b> called the Hampden Bridge, was built across the Murrumbidgee River at Wagga. The bridge served the Wagga Wagga community for over 100 years until 16 August 2006 when it was closed and fenced off to the public due to the bridge being declared a safety risk after one of the trusses failed. In 2014 the Hampden Bridge was demolished.|$|E
