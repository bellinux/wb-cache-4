A short period of infertility soon followed administration of oral doses of triethylenemelamine and <b>trimethylphosphate.</b> Triethylenemelamine, aziridinyl urea and ethylenedimethanesulphonate by the intraperitoneal route led to infertile egg production for several weeks.

By use of the first technique we noted enhancement of the n → π* and splitting of the π → π* transitions commencing with the heptamer in <b>trimethylphosphate</b> and trifluoroethanol. With the second method we found changes in chemical shifts for the amide protons consistent with the onset of helicity at the heptamer in the solvents noted above. When DMSO-d 6 is used as a solvent, no such chemical shift changes occur because the oligopeptides do not assume helical conformations...|$|E
40|$|Conformational {{isomerism}} of <b>trimethylphosphate</b> (TMP) {{has been}} studied de novo. TMP monomers were isolated in low temperature xenon matrices at different substrate temperatures and characterized using FTIR spectroscopy. At the lowest temperature, three different conformers, with overall molecular symmetries C 3, C 1 and Cs, were shown to co-exist in the matrix. Increase of the sample temperature led to conformational cooling, with the two minor conformers being depopulated successively, following an order of increasing stability. Initially, the less stable Cs conformer converted to the C 1 form and, at higher temperatures, the C 1 conformer converted to the global energy minimum, C 3. Interpretation of the experimental data was supported by extensive calculations of the vibrational spectra and barriers to the conformational interconversion. [URL]...|$|E

Cross section magnitudes are obtained by observation of positive ion production and normalization to ionization {{cross sections}} calculated elsewhere using the binary-encounter-Bethe method. The {{average cross section}} of the three bases is 3 – 10 times smaller than the effective cross section per nucleotide reported for single strand breaks in surface-bound super-coiled DNA. Consequently, damage to the bases alone does not appear to account for the major portion of the strand breaks. The presence of an OH group on the ribose surrogate considerably enhances its cross section. Model compounds in which protonation or OH groups are used to terminate bonds may therefore display larger cross sections than in DNA itself...|$|E
40|$|A proton-conducting {{membrane}} demonstrating excellent proton conductivity at high-temperature/low-humidity {{conditions as}} well as at fully hydrated states is an urgent demand for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). In this study, in a bid to achieve this goal, we develop a new hybrid membrane, which is based on incorporating SiO 2 -P 2 O 5 glass electrolytes into hydrophilic channels of Nafion 115 by in situ sol-gel synthesis of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and <b>trimethylphosphate</b> (TMP). The effect of SiO 2 -P 2 O 5 content on the morphology, state of water, and water uptake of the hybrid membranes is quantitatively identified. Not only the well-connected/enlarged hydrophilic channels but also {{the increase in the number}} of free/bound water molecules is observed in the hybrid membranes. These interesting features are expected to enable the hybrid membranes to present the higher proton conductivity than the pristine Nafion 115, which becomes more noticeable at high-temperature/low-humidity conditions. close 9...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} have a better {{understanding}} on the electrostatic contribution to the thermodynamic property of ionic liquids (ILs), a two-parameter equation of state (EOS) is developed on the basis of hard sphere perturbation theory by accounting for the dispersion interaction with Cotterman et al. 's ECS for L-J fluid and electrostatic interaction with mean spherical approximation (MSA) approach. The EOS is applicable for the density correlation Of Molecular liquids, and the resulting parameters, viz. Lennard-Jones dispersive parameter epsilon/k and soft-core diameter sigma, can be used to predict the density of molecular mixtures and the corresponding ILs. The results indicate that the density of IL is always about 10 % higher than the corresponding stoichionietric molecular mixture with which the IL is produced as an ionic adduct, for example, IL 1 -methyl- 3 -methylimidazolium dimethylphosphate ([MMIM][DMP]) versus equimolar mixture of 1 -methylimidazole (MIM) and <b>trimethylphosphate</b> (TMP). Furthermore, the density enhancement of ILs with respect to their corresponding stoichiometric molecular mixtures can be well represented by the electrostatic contribution among ionic species involved.

Coconut coir dust was pretreated with a 1 % alkaline solution. Its crystalline structure increased significantly {{due to the}} dissolution of lignin and hemicelluloses under alkaline conditions, exposing the cellulose. After NaOH and IL were employed, the XRD showed that peak (002) decreased significantly and peak (101) almost vanished. This significant decrease in crystallinity {{was related to the}} alteration of the substrate from the cellulose I structure to the cellulose II structure. The pretreated substrates were hydrolyzed to convert them to reducing sugars by pure cellulase and xylanase,and the reaction was conducted at 60 °C, pH 3, for 12 or 48 hours. The yields of sugar hydrolyzed from untreated and NaOH-pretreated substrates were 0. 07 and 0. 12 g sugar/g lignocellulose, respectively. Pretreatment with IL or the combination of NaOH+IL resulted in yields of reducing sugars of 0. 11 and 0. 13 g/g, respectively.

This species together with tetrahydrofuran (THF) are model compounds of deoxyribose nucleic acids (DNA) /ribose nucleic acids (RNA) backbone. Absolute photoabsorption cross sections (σ a) and ionization yields (η) are measured using the double-ion-chamber technique in the 11. 0 – 21. 45 eV energy range. Photoionization (σ i) and neutral-decay (σ n) cross sections in absolute scale are also derived. Moreover, theoretical photoabsorption cross sections are calculated using the time-dependent density functional theory from the excitation threshold up to 16 eV. Good {{agreement between the}} present calculated and experimental photoabsorption cross sections in the 11. 0 – 14. 5 eV range is encouraging. Also, the present measured data of σa and σi for TMP are about 1. 3 and 1. 5 times of those of THF, respectively. Thus, the experimental evidences {{that the majority of}} strand breaks being located at sugar rings in the irradiated DNA/RNA backbone moiety may be induced by a possible migration of the hole, initially created at phosphate group, to the linked sugar groups.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} organophosphate esters in air samples using C 8 Empore solid phase extraction (SPE) membranes has been developed. After the sampling the analytes {{trapped in the}} membrane are completely desorbed with methanol, using an extraction cell connected online to the organic modifier channel of a HPLC gradient pump. The addition of water to the mobile phase prior to analytical chromatography ensures that the analytes are refocused and efficiently separated. Sampling with Empore SPE membranes enables the collection of analytes in both the vapour phase and particulate matter. During the air sampling procedure no losses were observed after 24 h of sampling, yielding a total volume of 14. 4 m(3), even for the most volatile compound used in this investigation (<b>trimethylphosphate).</b> Complete desorption was observed for all the organophosphate esters and recoveries were greater than 95 %, with a relative standard deviation of less than 8 %. The limits of detection ranged between 0. 4 and 19 pg/m(3). The effect of particulate matter on the extraction efficiency was investigated in detail by spiking the membranes with reference standard material. It was {{also found that the}} SPE membranes could be stored for at least 5 days at room temperature without any evidence of loss. The efficacy of the method was verified using real samples from different common indoor environments.

40|$|This work {{provides}} {{the first set}} of electron-impact interaction cross section data of DNA constituents based on experiments. These data permit to investigate the accuracy by which water cross sections can be used to represent DNA media in track structure simulations of electrons with energies between 7 eV and 1 keV. Liquid water or water vapour is conventionally used in track structure simulation codes to estimate radiobiological effects, however, the interaction cross sections of liquid water have not been experimentally verified. Initially, electron track structure simulations in liquid water with the codes PTra and Geant 4 were benchmarked with respective experimental literature data. For this purpose, PTra was augmented with reviewed water cross section data for electrons and protons. The evaluated cross section data for electron impact on the DNA constituents tetrahydrofuran, <b>trimethylphosphate,</b> pyrimidine and purine were implemented in PTra for simulations of monoenergetic electrons in DNA media. The DNA media consisted of a composition of DNA constituents with different water content. Due to substantial differences in the cross section data of water and DNA constituents, a significant enhancement of calculated clustered ionisation and excitation events in DNA media relative to water was observed for electrons with energies below 150 eV. In consequence, the probability to produce biologically relevant ionisation clusters in the vicinity of a 1 MeV proton track is higher for DNA media compared to water. As a first step towards modelling the transport of ions in DNA medium, simulations of protons (0. 1 – 10 MeV) and alpha particles (0. 1 – 20 MeV) in nitrogen and propane were benchmarked by comparing simulated and measured nanodosimetric quantities...|$|E

The feasibility of using Mössbauer spectroscopy to determine the fate of the organotin species within the PVC is also assessed. The INDOR technique is used to obtain tin- 119 n. m. r. data for a series of trimethyl and dimethyltin(IV) compounds and the results interpreted in a manner illustrating the use of this method as a structural probe for the solution chemistry of organotin systems. In the case of lead, attention is given to the effects of use of that metal in petrol by examining its overall distribution pattern in the dust, soil, grasses, plants and fruit of a roadside environment.

In addition, another type of mixed-oxide, viz. phosphorus-doped Al 2 O 3 was studied. The binary oxides Ga 2 O 3 and La 2 O 3 and all the ternary oxides were deposited by the ALE method for the first time. New ALE processes were developed for the undoped and doped Al 2 O 3 films. The thin films were characterized by {{a wide range of}} methods for structural and surface analysis, including XRD, FTIR, XPS, AFM, XRF, RBS, TOF-ERDA, and SIMS. A review of previous work on these trivalent metal oxide thin films is presented by way of background. The Al 2 O 3 and Ga 2 O 3 films deposited from metal beta-diketonates and ozone were of high quality: stoichiometric, uniform, dense, and free of any significant contamination. However, the La 2 O 3 films contained an excess of oxygen, due to the carbonate-type impurity that was detected. All Al 2 O 3 and Ga 2 O 3 films were amorphous, but polycrystalline, cubic La 2 O 3 was formed at temperatures above 300  °C. Hexagonal La 2 O 3 film was obtained by annealing the as-deposited amorphous and cubic La 2 O 3 films. Simultaneously, the carbon content in the films was reduced. In contrast to the stable Al 2 O 3 and Ga 2 O 3 films, the cubic and hexagonal La 2 O 3 films were chemically unstable and reacted with ambient air, transforming to LaO(OH) and La(OH) 3, respectively. The perovskite-type oxides LaNiO 3, LaCoO 3, LaAlO 3, and LaGaO 3 were deposited using metal beta-diketonates and ozone as precursors. No optimal ALE process could be demonstrated for the LaNiO 3 and LaCoO 3 films, which were non-uniform in thickness and either consisted of separate oxide layers or contained an excess of the transition metal. The LaAlO 3 and LaGaO 3 film growth, in contrast, was well-controlled yielding stoichiometric, uniform, and smooth films, demonstrating the potential of the ALE technique for producing the more complex ternary oxide films. All the as-deposited ternary oxide films were amorphous but crystallized with cubic structure when post-annealed ex situ. After annealing high-quality, epitaxial LaAlO 3 and LaGaO 3 films were obtained on lattice-matched perovskite-type substrates while randomly or slightly oriented films were obtained on non-lattice matched substrates. The films were relatively pure and only small amounts of common impurities, carbon and hydrogen, were detected. Phosphorus-doped Al 2 O 3 films were deposited from AlCl 3, P 2 O 5 or <b>trimethylphosphate,</b> and water. The phosphorus content could be controlled by the phosphorus doping ratio: when the P/Al atomic ratio was below 1. 0, the films consisted of both Al 2 O 3 and AlPO 4, whereas above that they contained predominantly AlPO 4. Phosphorus was uniformly distributed when the phosphorus content exceeded 5 at. %, and it was enriched on the film/substrate interface when the content was lower. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} catalytic upgrading of phenolic compounds over ceria-based materials. The work {{was motivated by}} the need to find alternative industrial uses for the light rare earth elements (e. g. cerium) as part of the Critical Materials Institute. Cerium is typically encountered in the + 3 or + 4 oxidation state and its dioxide is the most technologically advanced cerium compound. Cerium dioxide (ceria) is best known for its ability to release and store oxygen, thereby acting as an oxygen buffer in many catalytic systems. The oxygen storage and release capability has been exploited in three-way catalysis {{and is one of the}} most industrialized uses of cerium. Traditionally, ceria has been explored for small molecule (e. g. CO) oxidation catalysis, while its utility as a catalyst for organic oxidations has been gaining attention. The unique oxygen-activating property of ceria has delayed its study as a catalyst component for reductive transformations. Phenolics represent an interesting class of oxygenates for transformation over ceria-based materials. The chemistry of hydroxyl-containing compounds over ceria is well-studied and is often preceded by reactive adsorption to form activated intermediates. The economic importance of phenolics as precursors for nylon production and the oxygenate-activating ability of ceria-based materials provide a good starting point for determining alternative industrial uses for cerium. Furthermore, phenolics can be derived from renewable resources, an industrial sector that is expected to see large growth during the current century. Identifying active, selective, and environmentally friendly catalytic systems that convert biorenewable compounds into commodity chemicals is thus critical for ushering in the biorefinery era. The catalytic systems described here demonstrate ceria-based materials are active for the reductive transformation of phenolics using molecular hydrogen and aliphatic alcohols. Palladium supported on high-surface-area ceria was found to effectively catalyze the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone at atmospheric pressure and room temperature under batch conditions. The activity was highly dependent on the catalyst prereduction temperature which led to optimization of Pd dispersion and metal-support interactions. Analogous to alkyl alcohols, phenol underwent dissociative adsorption on ceria to yield cerium-bound phenoxy and water. The phenoxy species were activated toward dearomatization by molecular hydrogen. Palladium supported on high-surface-area ceria (Pd/CeO 2) and sodium-modified ceria (Pd/Ce-Na) were used as catalysts for the aqueous-phase transfer hydrogenation of phenol using 2 -propanol under flow conditions. Both catalysts were active and showed constant activity for 7 days on-stream. Pd/Ce-Na showed a marked increase (6 x) in transfer hydrogenation activity over Pd/CeO 2. Modification of ceria by sodium provided more 2 -propanol adsorption sites and redox active sites (i. e. defects) for 2 -propanol dehydrogenation which resulted in higher phenol transfer hydrogenation activity. For primary alcohols, reduction of the ceria support to from cerium hydroxy carbonate occurred and led to irreversible deactivation of the catalyst. A deactivation mechanism involving C-C scission of acyl and carboxylate intermediates to form CO was proposed. Deposition of <b>trimethylphosphate</b> onto ceria followed by thermal treatment resulted in formation of surface phosphates with retention of redox activity. The introduction of phosphates generated BrÃÂ¸nsted acidic sites and decreased the number of Lewis acidic sites on the surface. Upon deposition of Pd, the multifunctional material showed enhanced activity for phenolic hydrogenolysis compared to Pd on the unmodified ceria support. This was attributed to the cooperativity between the Lewis acid sites, which activate phenolics for dearomatization, and the redox/acid property, which catalyzes hydrogenolysis...|$|E
