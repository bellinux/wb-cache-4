5|$|With the {{exception}} of <b>the</b> <b>Boeing</b> 707 and early Boeing 747 variants from BOAC, British Airways inherited a mainly UK-built fleet of aircraft when it was formed in 1974.

BA is now the largest operator of Boeing 747-400s, with 57 in its fleet. Prior {{to the introduction of}} the 787, when Boeing built an aircraft for British Airways, it was allocated the customer code 36, which appeared in their aircraft designation as a suffix, such as 737–436.|$|E
5|$|A long-time Boeing customer, BA ordered 59 Airbus A320 family {{aircraft}} in August 1998. In 2007 it purchased 12 Airbus A380s and 24 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, marking {{the start of}} its long-haul fleet replacement. The centrepiece of the airline's long-haul fleet is <b>the</b> <b>Boeing</b> 777, with 58 in the fleet. BA is the largest operator of <b>the</b> <b>Boeing</b> 747-400, with 41 registered to the airline. It is {{a founding member of}} the Oneworld airline alliance, along with American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Qantas, and the now defunct Canadian Airlines. The alliance has since grown to become the third largest, after SkyTeam and Star Alliance.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 and 2014, two new Boeing 737-800s {{fitted with}} <b>the</b> brand new <b>Boeing</b> Sky Interior {{became part of}} the fleet, which enabled Luxair to retire <b>the</b> last <b>Boeing</b> 737-500 from service.|$|R

5|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>Boeing</b> 707 is {{no longer}} in production, the E-3 mission package has been fitted into <b>the</b> <b>Boeing</b> E-767 for the Japan Air Self Defense Forces. The E-10 MC2A was {{intended}} to replace USAF E-3s—along with the RC-135 and the E-8, but the E-10 program was canceled by the Department of Defense. The USAF is now performing a series of incremental improvements, mainly to avionics, to bring the E-3 up to current standards of performance. Boeing is flight-testing its Block 40/45 E-3s. This modified E-3 contains upgrades of the mission crew and air battle management sections, as well as significantly upgraded electronic equipment.|$|E
50|$|Spring Airlines Japan took {{delivery}} {{of its first}} aircraft, a Boeing 737-800, on 17 July 2013. Although Spring Airlines uses Airbus A320 aircraft, the 737 was chosen for its Japanese subsidiary due to <b>the</b> <b>Boeing's</b> greater popularity among Japanese airlines and the relative ease of finding 737-qualified pilots.|$|R
