50|$|<b>Tacit</b> <b>collusion</b> occurs where firms undergo {{actions that}} are likely to {{minimize}} a response from another firm, e.g. avoiding the opportunity to price cut an opposition. Put another way, two firms agree to play a certain strategy without explicitly saying so. Oligopolists usually try not to engage in price cutting, excessive advertising or other forms of competition. Thus, there may be unwritten rules of collusive behavior such as price leadership (<b>tacit</b> <b>collusion).</b> A price leader will then emerge and it sets the general industry price, with other firms following suit. For example, see the case of British Salt Limited and New Cheshire Salt Works Limited.|$|E
50|$|In {{the study}} of {{economics}} and market competition, collusion takes place within an industry when rival companies cooperate for their mutual benefit. Collusion most often takes place within the market structure of oligopoly, where the decision of a few firms to collude can significantly impact the market as a whole. Cartels are a special case of explicit collusion. Collusion which is overt, on the other hand, is known as <b>tacit</b> <b>collusion,</b> and is legal.|$|E

This paper {{describes}} {{a way to}} preclude strong and <b>tacit</b> subgroup <b>collusion</b> in a non-repeated environment, when cartels can commit to transfer exchange ex post, but cannot reallocate. Robustness is due to an optional assignment rule in a sealed-bid Vickrey auction, which is not reached in equilibrium, but serves as a credible threat to any collusive agreement- and rules out surplus-generating manipulations of bids. In the absence of benefits to collusion the backward-inducing bidders will not engage into collusive negotiations. ...|$|R

50|$|Despite the {{apparent}} success of spectrum auctions, important disadvantages limiting efficiency and revenues are demand reduction and collusive bidding.The information and {{flexibility in the}} process of auction can be used to reduce auction prices by <b>tacit</b> <b>collusion.</b> When bidder competition is weak and one bidder holds an apparent advantage to win the auction for specific licenses, other bidders will often choose not to bid for higher prices, hence reducing the final revenue generated by the auction. In this case, the auction is best thought of as a negotiation among the bidders, who agree on who should win the auction for each discrete bit of spectrum.|$|E

The NASDAQ system automated such order processing and provided brokers with the latest competitive price quotes via a computer terminal. In March 1994, a study by two economists, William Christie and Paul Schultz, noted that NASDAQ bid-ask spreads were larger than was statistically likely, indicating [...] "We are unable to envision any scenario in which 40 to 60 dealers who are competing for order flow would simultaneously and consistently avoid using odd-eighth quotes without an implicit agreement to post quotes only on the even price fractions.

5000|$|<b>Tacit</b> <b>collusion</b> is best {{understood}} {{in the context of}} a duopoly and the concept of game theory (namely, Nash equilibrium). Let's take an example of two firms A and B, who both play an advertising game over an indefinite number of periods (effectively saying 'infinitely many'). Both of the firms' payoffs are contingent upon their own action, but more importantly the action of their competitor. They can choose to stay at the current level of advertising or choose a more aggressive advertising strategy. If either firm chooses low advertising while the other chooses high, then the low-advertising firm will suffer a great loss in market share while the other experiences a boost. However if they both choose high advertising, then neither firms' market share will increase but their advertising costs will increase, thus lowering their profits. If they both choose to stay at the normal level of advertising, then sales will remain constant without the added advertising expense. Thus, both firms will experience a greater payoff if they both choose normal advertising (however this set of actions is unstable, as both are tempted to defect to higher advertising to increase payoffs).

5000|$|Oligopolies become [...] "mature" [...] {{when they}} realise they can profit {{maximise}} through joint profit maximising. As {{a result of}} operating in countries with enforced competition laws, the Oligopolists will operate under <b>tacit</b> <b>collusion,</b> being collusion through an understanding that if all the competitors in the market raise their prices, then collectively all the competitors can achieve economic profits close to a monopolist, with out evidence of breaching government market regulations. Hence, the kinked demand curve for a joint profit maximising Oligopoly industry can model the behaviours of oligopolists pricing decisions other {{than that of the}} price leader (the price leader being the firm that all other firms follow in terms of pricing decisions). This is because if a firm unilaterally raises the prices of their good/service, and other competitors do not follow then, the firm that raised their price will then lose a significant market as they face the elastic upper segment of the demand curve. As the joint profit maximising achieves greater economic profits for all the firms, there is an incentive for an individual firm to [...] "cheat" [...] by expanding output to gain greater market share and profit. In Oligopolist cheating, and the incumbent firm discovering this breach in collusion, the other firms in the market will retaliate by matching or dropping prices lower than the original drop. Hence, the market share that the firm that dropped the price gained, will have that gain minimised or eliminated. This is why on the kinked demand curve model the lower segment of the demand curve is inelastic. As a result, price rigidity prevails in such markets.|$|E

Two environments are tested, in which the size of the spillover between advertising expenditures is varied. The results show that the competitiveness of advertising and prices are significantly higher when the advertising spillover is higher than the price spillover than when advertising spillover is lower than the price spillover. In the second environment, a higher degree of advertising collusion leads for experienced players to a higher degree of price collusion.

We propose a framework to analyze how inflationary uncertainty, interacting with real demand shocks, {{plays a role in}} increasing cartel stability. In particular, we derive the result that the minimum value of the real demand shock able to induce firms to deviate from the <b>collusion</b> <b>tacit</b> agreement - modeled in a repeated game context - is an increasing function of the inflationary uncertainty. Other things equal, inflationary uncertainty brings about more stability to <b>collusion</b> <b>tacit</b> agreements.

Because of the implementation of stabilizing plan Real in 1994, we consider statistical evidence regarding two periods, 1986 - 1994 and 1995 - 2000.

40|$|The article {{seeks to}} fill the gap between <b>tacit</b> and {{explicit}} <b>collusion</b> in a setting where firms observe only their own output levels and a common price, which includes a stochastic component. Without communication, firms fail to discriminate between random shocks and marginal deviations, which constrains the scope for collusion. By eliminating uncertainty about what has happened, communication facilitates detection of deviations but reduces collusive profits due to the risk of exposure to legal sanctions. With the optimal collusive strategy, firms communicate only if the market price falls somewhat below the trigger price. Moreover, they tend to communicate more often as they become less patient, a cartel grows in size, or demand uncertainty rises...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the {{implementation}} of Regulation 139/2004 and the turn towards a more effects-based approach to EU competition law, EU merger control was governed by EEC Regulation 4064/89. Under EEC Regulation 4064/89 (the 'old' regulation), a merger or concentration was prohibited if it would"create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would significantly impeded".The old substantive test is said to have encouraged two alternative interpretations of how to apply the test. The alternative interpretations suggest that, the presence of dominance alone is a sufficient condition to satisfy the dominance test and that as part of a two-tier test dominance is a necessary condition to satisfy before considering the dynamics of competition between the parties merging and the competitive characteristics of the market following the notification of a merger. The effective of the old [...] "dominance test" [...] increasingly began to be called into question with concerns regarding the issues of overenforcement and the false positives. The case of Airtours v Commission in 2002 served as the case that ultimately urged the Commission to recommend a change in EU merger regulation. The Commission prohibited the merger of Airtours and First Choice on the basis that it would create a collective dominant position in the market since there would be an incentive for the remaining firms in an oligopolistic market to restrict market capacity, leading to higher prices and increased profits as a result of subsequent market conditions following the merger. The oligopolists need not always [...] "behave as if there were one or more explicit agreements between them." [...] The Commission believed it was [...] "sufficient that the merger makes it rational for the oligopolists...to act individually in ways which will substantially reduce competition between them." [...] In the case of Airtours v Commission, the Court of First Instance annulled the Commission's decision to prohibit the Airtours-First Choice merger {{on the grounds that the}} Commission's interpretation of collective dominance was not informed by the widely recognised indicator of anti-competitive behaviour in an oligopolistic market - <b>tacit</b> <b>collusion.</b> The Airtours legal action created a significant level of uncertainty in EU merger law as a perceived gap had arisen with the law at the time - the gap of the non-collusive oligopoly.|$|E

"Every contract, {{combination}} in {{the form}} of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $100,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, $1,000,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court." [...] Sherman Act 1890 §1 Preventing collusion and cartels that act in restraint of trade is an essential task of antitrust law. It reflects the view that each business has a duty to act independently on the market, and so earn its profits solely by providing better priced and quality products than its competitors. The Sherman Act §1 prohibits [...] "every contract, combination {{in the form}} of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce." [...] This targets two or more distinct enterprises acting together in a way that harms third parties. It does not capture the decisions of a single enterprise, or a single economic entity, even though the form of an entity may be two or more separate legal persons or companies. In Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp. it was held an agreement between a parent company and a wholly owned subsidiary could not be subject to antitrust law, because the decision took place within a single economic entity. This reflects the view that if the enterprise (as an economic entity) has not acquired a monopoly position, or has significant market power, then no harm is done. The same rationale has been extended to joint ventures, where corporate shareholders make a decision through a new company they form. In Texaco Inc. v. Dagher the Supreme Court held unanimously that a price set by a joint venture between Texaco and Shell Oil did not count as making an unlawful agreement. Thus the law draws a [...] "basic distinction between concerted and independent action". Multi-firm conduct tends to be seen as more likely than single-firm conduct to have an unambiguously negative effect and [...] "is judged more sternly". Generally the law identifies four main categories of agreement. First, some agreements such as price fixing or sharing markets are automatically unlawful, or illegal per se. Second, because the law does not seek to prohibit every kind of agreement that hinders freedom of contract, it developed a [...] "rule of reason" [...] where a practice might restrict trade {{in a way that is}} seen as positive or beneficial for consumers or society. Third, significant problems of proof and identification of wrongdoing arise where businesses make no overt contact, or simply share information, but appear to act in concert. <b>Tacit</b> <b>collusion,</b> particularly in concentrated markets with a small number of competitors or oligopolists, have led to significant controversy over whether or not antitrust authorities should intervene. Fourth, vertical agreements between a business and a supplier or purchaser [...] "up" [...] or [...] "downstream" [...] raise concerns about the exercise of market power, however they are generally subject to a more relaxed standard under the [...] "rule of reason".|$|E

40|$|Antitrust law {{has long}} been {{concerned}} {{that the loss of}} a firm, through merger or exclusion, may improve the prospects for <b>tacit</b> or express <b>collusion</b> in a concentrated market.

This article explains how coordinated competitive effects analysis can be reconstructed around the role of a maverick firm that constrains prices when industry coordination is incomplete. Providing this explanation helps distinguish precompetitive mergers from anticompetitive ones, and may aid in the analysis of alleged exclusion.
