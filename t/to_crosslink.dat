2500|$|Cephalosporins are {{bactericidal}} {{and have}} the same mode of action as other β-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillins), but are less susceptible to β-lactamases. Cephalosporins disrupt the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer forming the bacterial cell wall. [...] The peptidoglycan layer is important for cell wall structural integrity. [...] The final transpeptidation step in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan is facilitated by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). PBPs bind to the D-Ala-D-Ala {{at the end of}} muropeptides (peptidoglycan precursors) <b>to</b> <b>crosslink</b> the peptidoglycan. Beta-lactam antibiotics mimic the D-Ala-D-Ala site, thereby irreversibly inhibiting PBP crosslinking of peptidoglycan.|$|E

40|$|Fanconi anaemia (FA) and Bloom {{syndrome}} (BS) are {{autosomal recessive}} diseases characterised by chromosome fragility and cancer proneness. Here, {{we report that}} BLM and the FA pathway are activated in response <b>to</b> both <b>crosslinked</b> DNA and replication fork stall. We provide evidence that BLM and FANCD 2 colocalise and co-immunoprecipitate following treatment with either DNA crosslinkers or agents inducing replication arrest. We also find that the FA core complex is necessary for BLM phosphorylation and assembly in nuclear foci in response <b>to</b> <b>crosslinked</b> DNA. Moreover, we show that knock-down of the MRE 11 complex, whose function is also {{under the control of}} the FA core complex, enhances cellular and chromosomal sensitivity <b>to</b> DNA interstrand <b>crosslinks</b> in BS cells. These findings suggest the existence of a functional link between BLM and the FA pathway and that BLM and the MRE 11 complex are in two separated branches of a pathway resulting in S-phase checkpoint activation, chromosome integrity and cell survival in response <b>to</b> <b>crosslinked</b> DNA...|$|R

50|$|Linoleic acid is used {{in making}} quick-drying oils, which are useful in oil paints and varnishes. These {{applications}} exploit the easy reaction of the linoleic acid with oxygen in air, which leads <b>to</b> <b>crosslinking</b> and formation of a stable film called linoxyn.|$|R
40|$|Organisms like Dictyostelium discoideum, often {{referred}} to as DNA damage "extremophiles", can survive exposure to extremely high doses of radiation and DNA crosslinking agents. These agents form highly toxic DNA crosslinks that cause extensive DNA damage. However, little is known about how Dictyostelium and the other "extremophiles" can tolerate and repair such large numbers of DNA crosslinks. Here we describe a comprehensive genetic analysis of crosslink repair in Dictyostelium discoideum. We analyse three gene groups that are crucial for a replication-coupled repair process that removes DNA crosslinks in higher eukarya: The Fanconi anaemia pathway (FA), translesion synthesis (TLS), and nucleotide excision repair. Gene disruption studies unexpectedly reveal that the FA genes and the TLS enzyme Rev 3 play minor roles in tolerance <b>to</b> <b>crosslinks</b> in Dictyostelium. However, disruption of the Xpf nuclease subcomponent results in striking hypersensitivity <b>to</b> <b>crosslinks.</b> Genetic interaction studies reveal that although Xpf functions with FA and TLS gene products, most Xpf mediated repair is independent of these two gene groups. These results suggest that Dictyostelium utilises a distinct Xpf nuclease-mediated repair process <b>to</b> remove <b>crosslinked</b> DNA. Other DNA damage-resistant organisms and chemoresistant cancer cells might adopt a similar strategy to develop resistance <b>to</b> DNA <b>crosslinking</b> agents...|$|R
5000|$|Lacritin {{is subject}} <b>to</b> <b>crosslinking</b> by tissue transglutaminase, thereby {{giving rise to}} lacritin multimers {{including}} dimers and trimers. [...] Crosslinking is initiated within 1 min in vitro, requiring as little as 0.1 nM lacritin. [...] The ~0.6 micro molar level of tissue transglutaminase estimated in human tears is sufficient <b>to</b> promote <b>crosslinking.</b> [...] Crosslinking involves the donors lysine 82 and 85 and the acceptor glutamine 106. [...] Glutamine 106 resides within the amphipathic alpha helix near the C-terminus responsible for binding the N-terminus of syndecan-1.

40|$|Using {{molecular}} dynamics simulations, a constitutive {{model for the}} chemical aging of polymer networks was developed.

This model was implemented in the finite element code Adagio and validated through comparison with experiment.

40|$|AbstractMass spectrometric {{structural}} analysis of crosslinked peptides {{is a powerful}} method to elucidate the spatial arrangement of polypeptides in protein complexes. Our aim is to develop bifunctional crosslinkers that, after crosslinking protein complexes followed by proteolytic digestion, give rise <b>to</b> <b>crosslinked</b> peptides that can be readily tracked down by mass spectrometry. To this end we synthesized the crosslinker N-benzyliminodiacetoyloxysuccinimid (BID), which yields stable benzyl cation marker ions upon low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) tandem mass spectrometry. Sensitive detection of the marker ion upon low-energy CID is demonstrated with different BID-crosslinked peptide preparations. With BID it becomes possible <b>to</b> retrieve <b>crosslinked</b> and crosslinker-adducted peptides, without the necessity of purifying <b>crosslinked</b> peptides prior <b>to</b> identification.
