25|$|Nanotechnology {{will replace}} our entire {{manufacturing}} base with a new, radically more precise, radically less expensive, and radically more flexible {{way of making}} products. The aim is not simply to replace today's computer chip making plants, but also to replace the assembly lines for cars, televisions, telephones, books, surgical tools, missiles, bookcases, airplanes, tractors, and all the rest. The objective is a pervasive change in manufacturing, a change <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> virtually no product untouched. Economic progress and military readiness in the 21st Century will depend fundamentally on maintaining a competitive position in nanotechnology.|$|E
25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, {{we have to}} say that we feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, for it is things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame and that is a dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E
25|$|A {{villager}} (Vichare) {{brings his}} 8-year-old grandson Parshuraam (also known as Parshya) {{to a doctor}} in Pune to diagnose the child's eyes. They are accompanied by Parshya's maternal uncle Diwakar. On the first day Vichare is asked to sign the usual papers before admission in hospital. Upon asking, he learns that the papers say the doctor would not be responsible if anything goes wrong. Vichare, the rustic grandfather finds these terms unacceptable. A medical social worker, Aasawari, quickly comes in and explains the practice to Vichare. She calms him down and accompanies them during the first appointment with the doctor. Dr. Sane quickly diagnoses child {{as a victim of}} retinoblastoma — a rare retinal cancer. After consulting with other colleagues in US and UK doctor finds that only way to save child's life is to perform an operation <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> the child blind. As per rule, doctor explains this and insists child be informed of this before surgery. He cannot be operated without this knowledge as it was against ethics. Aasawari (Amruta Subhash) who helps the doctor in convincing the grandfather and the grandson, tries to keep track of Vichare and persuades him not fall prey to other doctors promising false medicines. She tries to befriend Parshya to explain him what is going to happen. However, she finds it is too difficult to explain to him that he will turn blind.|$|E

Sam Wollaston of The Guardian reacted positively to the episode, stating [...] "it's nice to see MI5 locking horns with the Russians again.

[...] Gerard O'Donovan of The Daily Telegraph placed the episode as a [...] "critic's choice," [...] calling it a [...] "superb season closer," [...] and [...] "all terrifically exciting." [...] O'Donovan also said of the episode's settings; [...] "the streets and Underground tunnels of London have rarely been used to such climactic effect – with great performances from everyone involved."

500|$|Rolling Stone {{reviewer}} Chris Steffen {{praised the}} percussive edge on All Hope Is Gone noting, [...] "The band's multiple percussionists generate a din that's more suffocating than ever [...] 'Gematria'." [...] He proposed [...] "Snuff" [...] as the [...] "most melodic" [...] {{song on the}} album, comparing it to [...] "Circle" [...] from Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). Steffen also wrote that [...] " [...] 'Psychosocial' is capped off with a time-signature shattering guitar/drum breakdown <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> the best air-instrumentalists stumped". The album was praised by Total Guitars writer Nick Cracknell, who declared the effort [...] "Slipknot's heaviest and most aggressive work to date". He compared [...] "Dead Memories" [...] to the works of Alice in Chains, while praising [...] "Gehenna" [...] for being the band's [...] "most experimental work in their history". Cracknell went on to state [...] "Wherein Lies Continue" [...] contains a [...] "huge chugging verse riff" [...] which evolves into an [...] "incredible soaring chorus".

500|$|Peter Bartholow of GameSpot {{summarized}} Mischief Makers as [...] "a {{good game}} <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> players wanting more". He liked the bosses, {{which made the}} player use all available skills, but felt they were short-lived and easily solved {{in the context of}} a short game with tutorials as one fifth of its levels. He did not consider the ending extension a suitable reward for returning to the levels, and predicted that most players would not finish the game more than once. Game Informer echoed Bartholow's comments about the game's brevity, and named the game's seven-event olympics as a highlight. Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly wrote that the game felt incomplete and lamented that [...] "a decent player can finish the game in under three hours", though Next Generation said the game was [...] "certainly long enough". The game's frequent reuse of a small selection of tiles, objects, sound effects, soundtracks, and bland backgrounds (compared to the [...] "impressive" [...] boss battle animations and effects) led GameSpot Bartholow to suggest that Mischief Makers was limited by its cartridge space. He concluded that the [...] "decent" [...] game would be [...] "truly excellent ... on another medium". Zachary Miller of Nintendo World Report reported that the graphics did not age well into 2010. Electronic Gaming Monthly wrote that the game is [...] "definitely a sleeper hit". As Hardcore Gamer Ryan Cartmel put it, the game went [...] "largely unnoticed".|$|E

2500|$|The Tevatron and LHC have active {{experimental}} programs {{searching for}} supersymmetric particles. [...] Since {{both of these}} machines are hadron colliders — proton antiproton for the Tevatron and proton proton for the LHC — they search best for strongly interacting particles. Therefore, most experimental signature involve production of squarks or gluinos. [...] Since the MSSM has R-parity, the lightest supersymmetric particle is stable and after the squarks and gluinos decay each decay chain will contain one LSP <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> the detector unseen.
