500|$|Juno actor Jason Bateman {{defended the}} film. [...] "Unfortunately," [...] he said, [...] "we’ve had these {{instances}} where guys kill {{people because of}} what they hear in rock ‘n roll lyrics or some garbage like that. Look, if you’re going to blame a movie or song for your actions, whether they be good or bad, I think you’re looking at the wrong things to influence your life. I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> look to other areas of their life for lessons and guidance, mainly parents, or teachers, or friends, or whomever. That should probably be where you should point your eyes and ears." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roberts {{said in a}} 2007 interview: [...] "Right now I am {{focusing}} on movies. I am getting ready {{to start a new}} movie this summer so that is taking a lot of my time. I think when I am a little bit older it is definitely something I'd like to pursue." [...] In another interview, she said: [...] "My musical career is indefinitely on hold. I don't like people who become like 'actor slash singer.' I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> be one or the other because usually you're not going to be great at both. You're going to be better at one, so you might as well stick to the one you're good at. I'm going for acting." ...|$|E
60|$|On Friday {{morning about}} eleven 1500 cacao seeds arrived, and we set to and toiled from twelve {{that day to}} six, {{and went to bed}} pretty tired. Next day I got {{about an hour and a}} half at my History, and was at it again by 8.10, and except an hour for lunch kept at it till four P.M. Yesterday, I did some History in the morning, and slept most of the afternoon; and to-day, being still averse from {{physical}} labour, and the mail drawing nigh, drew out of the squad, and finished for press the fifth chapter of my History; fifty-nine pages in one month; which (you will allow me to say) is a devil of a large order; it means at least 177 pages of writing; 89,000 words! and hours going to and fro among my notes. However, this is the way it has to be done; the job must be done fast, or it is of no use. And it is a curious yarn. Honestly, I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> be amused and convinced, if they could be at the pains to look at such a damned outlandish piece of machinery, which of course they won't. And much I care.|$|E

5000|$|Personalism: Whereas the legalist <b>thinks</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> work to laws, the {{situational}} ethicist believes that laws benefit the people. This forces {{the user to}} ask 'who is to be helped?' instead of 'what is the law', stressing the importance of people before laws.|$|R
5000|$|The {{closing of}} these [...] "unofficial" [...] trails is very {{controversial}} and many hikers <b>think</b> that <b>people</b> <b>should</b> {{be allowed to}} take their chances.

5000|$|A {{rock concert}} is [...] "kicking television." [...] If you're {{out of the}} house and with a bunch of people enjoying {{something}} together, that's kicking television to me. I don't <b>think</b> very many <b>people,</b> myself included, will ever kick television cold turkey, but I certainly <b>think</b> more <b>people</b> <b>should</b> be aware of what it's doing to them.|$|R
5000|$|Bragg {{supports}} both Scottish and Welsh independence. In 2014, {{he praised}} musician David Bowie for speaking out {{in favour of}} Scotland remaining part of the UK: [...] "Bowie's intervention encourages people in England to discuss {{the issues of the}} independence referendum, and I <b>think</b> English <b>people</b> <b>should</b> be discussing it, so I welcome his intervention." ...|$|R
5000|$|Some of BNN's {{programs}} have included [...] "Try Before You Die" [...] - where presenters {{attempted to do}} things that they <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> do at least once in their life, made headlines when presenter Sander Lantinga acted as a streaker during a quarter-finals match at Wimbledon between Maria Sharapova and Elena Dementieva.|$|E

5000|$|It's one {{of those}} songs which has such a fantasy feel about it. I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> just listen to it, think about it, and then {{make up their own}} minds as to what it says to them... "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] didn't just come out of thin air. I did a bit of {{research}} although it was tongue-in-cheek and mock opera. Why not? —Freddie Mercury ...|$|E
50|$|Lucifer brings Adam to {{a future}} egalitarianist world state. Although {{initially}} positive, Adam immediately regrets the disappearance of nations, as he <b>thinks</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> have a past and an identity to hold on to. Animals and plants which are not useful are extinct and the useful ones have been genetically modified. Adam questions the materialist worldview and is arrested for criminal thinking. Eve appears as a mother who is punished for refusing to let society educate her child. Adam and Lucifer travel further to a dehumanized future in space. Adam is at first unsettled, but when the spirit of Earth urges him to return, he proclaims that his spirit can live beyond the body. On the verge of annihilation, Adam changes his mind and promises to keep striving on Earth. He accepts mortality and man's struggle.|$|R
50|$|She has {{published}} {{a collection of essays}} titled Sensible Sensuality (2010), where redefining femininity with Eastern perspective, the book explores why sexuality {{plays a major role in}} our understanding of Eastern feminism. The author thinks feminism should not act in opposition to men as individuals. To her, feminism is against oppressive and outdated social structures which forces both men and women into positions which are false and antagonistic. Thus, everyone has an important role to play in the feminist movement. It seems ironic that feminism has been characterized as anti-male, when in fact, it seeks to liberate men from the macho stereotypic roles men often have to endure such as the need to suppress feelings, act aggressively, and be deprived of contact with children. Sahoo <b>thinks</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> emphasize their femininity rather to impose the so-called stereotyped feministic attitude of the second wave.|$|R

5000|$|Throughout the film, {{original}} footage is seamlessly {{interspersed with}} the dramatisation. Richard Dimbleby is seen {{both in the}} drama and in the BBC report he gave in 1945. Johnston and Sington watch footage of a tractor scooping up corpses ready for burial, and Johnston tells Sington [...] "I don't {{think people are going}} to want to see this."

[...] "It's very well put in the grizzly bear. I don't think Americans are necessarily cvilised or too calm and rational about their approach to life. I rather like that. I really like grizzly bears too. I like grizzly bears {{a lot more than}} most people ... You can take the film's politics to be anyway you want, for or against the United States".|$|E
5000|$|When {{compared}} with Deep Blue or with Watson, AlphaGo's underlying algorithms are potentially more general-purpose, {{and may be}} evidence that the scientific community is making progress toward artificial general intelligence. Some commentators believe AlphaGo's victory makes for a good opportunity for society to start discussing preparations for the possible future impact of machines with general purpose intelligence. In March 2016, AI researcher Stuart Russell stated that [...] "AI methods are progressing much faster than expected, (which) makes {{the question of the}} long-term outcome more urgent," [...] adding that [...] "in order to ensure that increasingly powerful AI systems remain completely under human control... {{there is a lot of}} work to do." [...] Some scholars, such as physicist Stephen Hawking, warn that some future self-improving AI could gain actual general intelligence, leading to an unexpected AI takeover; other scholars disagree: AI expert Jean-Gabriel Ganascia believes that [...] "Things like 'common sense'... may never be reproducible", and says [...] "I don't see why we would speak about fears. On the contrary, this raises hopes in many domains such as health and space exploration."

500|$|In theses 41–47 Luther criticizes indulgences on {{the basis}} that they {{discourage}} works of mercy by those who purchase them. Here he begins to use the phrase, [...] "Christians are to be taught..." [...] to state how he <b>thinks</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> be instructed on the value of indulgences. They should be taught that giving to the poor is incomparably more important than buying indulgences, that buying an indulgence rather than giving to the poor invites God's wrath, and that doing good works makes a person better while buying indulgences does not. In theses 48–52 Luther takes the side of the pope, saying that if the pope knew what was being preached in his name he would rather St. Peter's Basilica be burned down than [...] "built up with the skin, flesh, and bones of his sheep." [...] Theses 53–55 complain about the restrictions on preaching while the indulgence was being offered.|$|R

The state representatives said TASSC had [...] "a clear history of industry involvement in staking out positions opposing now widely held beliefs regarding {{public health and the}} environment." [...] In response, Carruthers expressed disagreement with the stance of TASSC on the risks of second-hand smoke. [...] "I'm four-square against second-hand smoke," [...] Carruthers {{said in an interview with}} the Albuquerque Journal.

5000|$|Scholars {{and artists}} also worry that sharing {{authority}} devalues the hard-won expertise of professionals. The artist Fred Wilson, whose 1992-1993 exhibit [...] "Mining the Museum" [...] at the Maryland Historical Society {{is considered a}} landmark moment in museums' assessments of their role as historical arbiters, has expressed, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> share authority {{to the degree that}} you devalue your own scholarship, your own knowledge. That's not sharing anything. You're not giving what you have. That is highly problematic. You have to be realistic about your years of experience, what you can give, and what others can give." ...|$|E
