40|$|AbstractThis paper investigates a {{greenhouse}} microclimatic environment {{controlled by a}} mobile measuring station {{with the aim of}} improving performance by using wireless sensor networks (WSN) technology.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} avoid wheel {{slippage}} or mechanical damage during the mobile robot naviga-tion, {{it is necessary to}} smoothly change driving velocity or direction of the mobile robot. This means that dynamic constraints of the mobile robot should be considered in the design of path tracking algorithm. In the study, a path tracking problem is formulated as following a virtual target vehicle which is assumed to move exactly along the path with specified velocity. The driving velocity control law is designed basing on bang-bang control considering the acceleration bounds of driving wheels. The steering control law is designed by combining the bang-bang control with an intermediate path called the landing curve which guides the robot to smoothly land on the virtual target’s tangential line. The curvature and convergence analyses provide sufficient stability conditions for the proposed path tracking controller. A series of path tracking simulations and experiments conducted for a <b>two-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> mobile robot show the validity of the proposed algorithm. Key words: steering control, bang-bang control, nonholonomic constraints, path tracking algorithm, motion planning, mobile robot navigation...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of a <b>two-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> hitch-cart designed for draft animal power has been assessed. The cart fits a three-point linkage system and a ground-driven power take-off (PTO). Conventional pneumatic tires and metallic wheels have been tested in dedicated draft trials with increasing torque applied to PTO (7. 0 to 70 Nm) at two ballast levels (100 and 200 kg). Draft force varies from a minimum of about 760 N (pneumatic tires and the lowest ballast), up to about 4480 N (metallic wheels and the highest ballast), with a linear increase {{as a function of}} the PTO applied torque. In term of global efficiency the better performances was achieved in different conditions. The metallic wheels deliver greater power to the PTO than pneumatic tires. Furthermore, they had global efficiencies higher than pneumatic for high power requirements, while the pneumatics perform better when the required power is low. Slippage rises as a function of increasing torque and decreasing ballast, with metallic wheels allowing delivery of greater PTO torque at the same slippage extent. The performances of the cart are consistent with the use of implements designed for small tractors...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{both the}} control design used to stabilize a small rover on two wheels as a mobile inverted pendulum, {{as well as}} the steering design used to achieve a series of unique stable driving modes. Additionally, the rover is assessed as an educational platform for use in teaching various STEM topics at both the high school and undergraduate university levels. The vehicle, termed BeagleRover, uses four DC motors and four servo motors to independently steer each wheel and achieve a total of six different driving modes, four of which are inherently stable four-wheel drive modes while two are unstable <b>two-wheel</b> <b>drives</b> modes. Two of the four stable drive modes implement Ackermann steering geometry to reduce side slip when driving around a turn. Experimental results using measurements from an onboard gyroscope suggest that side slip is indeed reduced by this method. Stability in the two unstable drive modes is achieved through classical control methods including lead and lag control. Complementary filtering of gyroscope and accelerometer measurements is used to derive accurate body position data for use in feedback. In support of current STEM education trends, this thesis provides a detailed solution set to the steering, control and filtering problems for potential use in STEM course material...|$|R
