The descriptions would sometimes be accompanied by unusual behavior such as specific fears, and the children might have a birthmark the same shape as wounds on the body of the deceased person whose life was purportedly being recalled. The children claiming to have lived before might exhibit special skills, such as playing an instrument or speaking a language they appeared not to have learned.|$|E
2500|$|At this, {{the halfway}} point of the championship, Prost's lead over Senna had {{increased}} to 20 points; Britain was the 4th consecutive race Senna had retired from- and Prost had won 3 of those 4 races. Despite much talk, he downplayed {{the thought of a}} third championship. [...] "I don't want <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the championship, getting into all that," [...] he said, [...] "but I'm much happier now, yes. Motivated again. I've had no engine problems since Mexico, which is nice, and also I'm pleased to see Ferrari getting more competitive: both Nigel and Gerhard can win races and that can only help me." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 21, 2006, Pronk {{asked the}} warring parties in Darfur, {{including}} President Omar al-Bashir {{and the seven}} rebel movements, to observe a [...] "month of tranquility" [...] during Ramadan, which would begin September 23, 2006. His implicit call for a ceasefire in the western region of Sudan came after the Khartoum government withdrew its ultimatum for African Union peacekeepers to pull out. Other African states then agreed to extend their mandate {{until the end of}} 2006. By Pronk's request, they would finish the collision course, which would mean no fighting, no bombing, no changes of heart. Such a lull would help [...] "create an atmosphere" [...] for a new round of negotiations. The peace deal was [...] "in a coma": not dead but dying. In addition the rejectionist factions should end the quarrel <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> everything related to the Darfur peace agreement to improve it.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Revealing Science of God" [...] {{is based}} on the shruti class of Hindu scripture which Yogananda {{described}} as scriptures that are [...] "directly heard" [...] or [...] "revealed", in particular the Vedas. Regarding its title, Anderson said: [...] "It's always delicate <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> religious things ... should have just been [...] "The Revealing". But I got sort of hip." [...] According to Howe, the track was originally 28 minutes in length but six minutes were cut due to the time constraints of a vinyl record. His guitar solos on the track, performed on a Gibson ES-175, were influenced by his belief that Frank Zappa performed lengthy solos [...] "because the audience wanted it. I was thinking at one stage, [...] "I'll do that. They'll love it". Anderson was inspired to open the track with voices that gradually build from listening to Gregorian chants. The ongoing Vietnam War at the time provided a source for its lyrics. The [...] "Young Christians see it..." [...] section of the song originated from a take recorded during the Fragile recording sessions that was previously unreleased until the album's 2015 reissue, which contained the track named [...] "All Fighter's Past".|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell's {{opposition to the}} nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court, of which Falwell had said, [...] "Every good Christian should be concerned", Goldwater retorted: [...] "Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass." [...] (According to John Dean, Goldwater actually suggested that good Christians ought to kick Falwell in the [...] "nuts", but the news media [...] "changed the anatomical reference.") Goldwater also had harsh words for his one-time political protegé, President Reagan, particularly after the Iran–Contra Affair became public in 1986. Journalist Robert MacNeil, a friend of Goldwater's from the 1964 Presidential campaign, recalled interviewing him in his office shortly afterward. [...] "He {{was sitting in his}} office with his hands on his cane... and he said to me, 'Well, aren't you going to ask me about the Iran arms sales?' It had just been announced that the Reagan administration had sold arms to Iran. And I said, 'Well, if I asked you, what would you say?' He said, 'I'd say it's the god-damned stupidest foreign policy blunder this country's ever made!'", though aside from the Iran–Contra scandal, Goldwater thought nonetheless that Reagan was a good president. In 1988 during that year's [...] presidential campaign, he pointedly told vice-presidential nominee Dan Quayle at a campaign event in Arizona [...] "I want you to go back and tell George Bush <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the issues." ...|$|E

After a series of consultations, King Albert II decided to reject Prime Minister Leterme's resignation on 17 July.
