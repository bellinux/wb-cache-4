5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E

500|$|In another twist Mercedes {{discovered}} that Silas {{would not be}} put on trial and would instead be put in an institute for the insane. Metcalfe said this left her alter ego feeling [...] "very let down" [...] as a trial would be the opportunity for Mercedes to [...] "tell the world about the terrible things Silas did {{and make sure that}} he got punished". She {{went on to say that}} Mercedes felt like Silas was [...] "getting away with it". Metcalfe explained that Mercedes feared that Silas would escape and explained that Mercedes never recovered from her ordeal but did what she usually did: [...] "put it in a box and tried to forget about it.

500|$|Homer {{is invited}} to speak his mind on a popular cable news show called Head Butt, on which host Nash Castor and {{commentator}} Adriatica Vel Johnson argue that he will soon be forgotten. However, Homer makes a convincing rant in which he tells the viewers that unlike television [...] such as Nash and Adriatica, he speaks for the common man. When the show is over, the cable network executives give Homer his own television show called Gut Check with Homer Simpson, where he provides a mix of populist and conservative ideas. During one episode, he pours [...] "gravy of freedom" [...] over a steak shaped like America, using the gravy {{as a metaphor for}} the things that make the country great. He then encourages his viewers to [...] "get on the boat" [...] to protest about <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> in society, and proceeds to place a gravy boat on his head. This wins Homer a huge base of support among average Americans, and soon the [...] "gravy boat movement" [...] becomes popular throughout the country.|$|E
500|$|Connor again {{returns for}} Angel:After the Fall. Brian Lynch was {{initially}} confused {{about how to}} incorporate Connor into the story. It was Whedon who hit upon the arc that Connor would follow in the series. He said, [...] "Connor's a young kid, he's got powers, he doesn't have any of <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>things,</b> he's not a vampire, so maybe he would enjoy it, and maybe {{he would be the}} closest thing to a superhero hell has". Well-adjusted now, Connor is shown [...] "fully embracing his qualities and role of a hero" [...] for the comic series. Originally Lynch had planned for Nina Ash to be more involved in his storyline, but with time it became clear to him that Connor's story is more about his relationship with Angel. So Nina fell to the wayside and Connor-Angel went on to become a much closer father-son unit. Connor also went from the character Lynch had the most trouble with to the character he enjoys writing most. Regarding Connor's upcoming role in Angel & Faith, Whedon joked about time-traveling him to the early 1960s and making him an ad executive, referencing Kartheiser 's recent role in the critically acclaimed television series Mad Men. Author Christos Gage describes the necessity of Connor's appearance with [...] "otherwise Angel is just a deadbeat Dad!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Mrs. Ann Bowles and Mrs. Clara Phelps are Mildred's {{friends and}} {{representative}} of the anti-intellectual, hedonistic society presented in the novel. During a social visit to Montag's house, they brag about ignoring <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> {{in their lives and}} have a cavalier attitude towards the upcoming war, their husbands, their children, and politics. Mrs. Phelps' husband Pete was called in to fight in the upcoming war (and believes that he'll be back in a week because of how quick the war will be) and thinks having children serves no purpose other than to ruin lives. Mrs. Bowles is a thrice married, single mother. Her first husband divorced her, her second died in a jet accident, and her third committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. She has two children who do not like or respect her due to her permissive, often negligent and abusive parenting; Mrs. Bowles brags that her kids beat her up, and she's glad she can hit back. When Montag reads Dover Beach to them, he strikes a chord in Mrs. Phelps, who starts crying over how hollow her life is. Mrs. Bowles chastises Montag for reading [...] "silly awful hurting words".|$|E
