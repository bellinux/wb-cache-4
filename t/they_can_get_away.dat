500|$|On 11 September 2012, it was {{reported}} that AJ would seduce Roxy Mitchell and they would spend the night together in Masood and Zainab's house after an evening of drinking. At the time, it was unknown if it would be a one-off or if a longer relationship would start. An insider from EastEnders told Inside Soap that Roxy and AJ are both looking for fun and they [...] "hit it off" [...] because she loves [...] "a man who can make her laugh and AJ definitely ticks that box." [...] They added that they have [...] "great chemistry" [...] but said that as Roxy is sidetracked by another man, [...] "AJ will have to fight [...] for her affections" [...] if he wants her. An insider also told the Daily Star that the two [...] "can't keep their hands off each other" [...] and [...] "Roxy is more than up for it." [...] They added that [...] "Zainab would go mental if she knew what they were up to under her roof and {{it remains to be seen}} whether <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with it. Roxy is the last person who Zainab would want AJ to hook up with. [...] Even Masood could not defend his brother this time as he had been pretty disrespectful." [...] Digital Spy also noted chemistry between AJ and Roxy, saying they [...] "clearly enjoy each other's company". Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror said the relationship between Roxy and AJ is [...] "played for laughs", contrasting with Roxy's relationship with Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd).|$|E
2500|$|In Rope, Granger and John Dall portrayed two {{intellectuals who}} commit a murder simply to prove <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with it. The two {{characters}} and their former professor, played by Jimmy Stewart, {{were supposed to}} be homosexual, and Granger and Dall discussed the subtext of their scenes. Because The Hays Office was keeping close tabs on the project, however, the final script was so discreet that Laurents remained uncertain of whether Stewart ever realized that his own character was homosexual. Hitchcock shot the film in continuous, uninterrupted 10-minute takes, the amount of time a reel of Technicolor film lasted, and, as a result, technical problems frequently brought the action to a frustrating halt throughout the 21-day shoot. The film ultimately received mixed reviews, although most critics were impressed by Granger, who in later years said he was happy {{to be part of the}} experience, but wondered [...] "what the film would have been like had [...] shot it normally" [...] and [...] "had he not had to worry about censorship." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{dropping}} out of Carnegie Tech in early 1963, he relocated to Los Angeles {{with the intent of}} being involved with the growing West Coast beatnik subculture and to play with his older brother Carson Parks as the Steeltown Two (later enlarged to three), which eventually became the folk group the Greenwood County Singers. The group included future RCA Records producer and recording artist Rick Jarrard. Parks later said of this decision, [...] "Going to California meant I escaped John Cage. I escaped the abstractions, the music you can't remember, the highbrow angst." [...] The two Parks brothers performed together at various coffeehouses around San Diego, Santa Barbara, and San Francisco. One of the people in attendance at a Santa Barbara performance turned out to be future Byrds member David Crosby, who at the time remarked to friend David Lindley, [...] "If <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with it, so can we." [...] While in California, Parks attempted to land a job performing on the television show Art Linkletter's House Party but was not accepted. Parks took a short hiatus from this group, briefly moving to New England {{to be part of the}} Brandywine Singers, earning up to $3,000 a week.|$|E

50|$|The tragic poet then {{decides to}} appear as himself and in this {{capacity}} he quickly negotiates a peace with the Chorus of women, securing their co-operation with a promise not to insult them in his future plays. The women decline to help him release Mnesilochus (now a prisoner of the Athenian state) but they do agree not to interfere with plans for his escape. Disguised finally as an old lady and attended by a dancing girl and flute player, Euripides distracts the Scythian Archer long enough to set Mnesilochus free. The Scythian attempts to apprehend them before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> clean <b>away</b> but he is steered {{in the wrong direction}} by the Chorus and the comedy ends happily.|$|R

He learns it was perpetrated by Henry Lin's crew {{in retaliation for the}} Jax and SAMCRO hitting their heroin and guns, which they did as payback for Tara's murder (which SAMCRO believes was done by Lin's order.) As he heads back to his hotel room, he notices a Chinese man getting out of a car in the parking lot and following him up the stairs. He locks himself in his room, and the man leaves.|$|R
2500|$|Dawkins expresses {{concern about}} {{increasing}} religious influence in British schools with over 7,000 faith schools already {{and the government}} encouraging more, so {{over half of the}} new City Academies are expected to be sponsored by religious organizations. He says that the most worrying development is a new wave of private Evangelical schools that have adopted [...] the American Baptist Accelerated Christian Education curriculum, and as an example calls on Phoenix Academy in London. Dawkins is shown around the school by head teacher Adrian Hawkes and remarks on how the teaching material appears to mention God or Jesus on almost every page; such as a reference to Noah's Ark in a science textbook. Hawkes responds by saying that the stories could {{have a lot to do}} with science if you believe in them, and that the science he was taught at school is laughable today. As an example, he mentions that he was taught that the moon came from the Earth's ocean and was [...] "somehow flung out into space" [...] during the early years of the Earth's life. Dawkins says that it should have been presented as a strong current theory. Another lesson talks about AIDS as being the [...] "wages of sin", so Dawkins inquires whether this might not be mixing health education with moralistic preaching. Hawkes responds that without a law-giver, [...] "Why is rape wrong? Why is pedophilia wrong?" [...] and that if people believe <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with committing bad deeds then they will tend to do them. Dawkins responds to this claim by asking Hawkes if the only reason he doesn't do these things is that he's frightened of God and subsequently suggests that this attitude is characteristic of the warped morality that religion tends to instill in people.|$|E

40|$|Poultry {{represent}} {{the largest number}} of animals slaughtered for food in the United States. Nine of the ten billion animals slaughtered in US facilities each year are birds- chickens, turkeys, ducks, and others. Yet poultry are excluded from humane slaughter protection. The 1958 federal Humane Methods of Slaughter Act does not cover birds. At the time, those working to enact some form of humane slaughter legislation omitted poultry, with the understanding that birds would subsequently be brought under the coverage accorded to mammals. The time has come to fulfill this goal. L. P ar as ca nd ol a "Slaughter is different from processing in that the raw material is alive, has a central nervous system, can express emotional states, and has biological components like humans. "- Dr. Janice Swanson, American Meat Institute Foundation's Annual Animal Handling and Stunning Conference, February 21 - 22, 2002 “Do you think from your perception that the birds have a sense of {{what is going to happen}} to them?” “Yes. They try everything in their power to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from the [killing] machine and to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from you. Even the ones that are stunned into immobility. If these people are trying to say, because this chicken is stunned, it doesn't know what's going to happen or doesn't know what's going on, they are lying. I stood on the kill floor and watched.

40|$|Escapism is {{a common}} defense mechanism, {{especially}} {{for people who are}} coming of age. Humans run when they feel they cannot handle the weight of their struggle, when the sting of their internalized emotions builds dangerously high and they are left to choose fight or to choose flight. Non-confrontational people will almost always choose the latter. The consequences of facing a problem directly may feel enormous, even world ending, to a young mind with little to no experience navigating adulthood. Through the lens of young adults who flee to summer camp to hide from their strenuous home lives this creative thesis aims to assess what happens after a person chooses flight over fight. These characters must learn that escape is not really possible. Memory will haunt. Internalized emotions will push at the mind and heart mercilessly, painfully, until the person loses control over them. Other conflicts, some bigger than they have ever had to face before, will arise and threaten their hopes and dreams. While these camp counselors may find solace and comfort at their home away from home, it cannot provide the total diversion they seek. I chose to tell this story {{in the form of a}} rock musical because it is the only world in which these characters can exist. These young adults leave for camp in order to flee from pain that boils inside of them, pain that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> never truly <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from. In need of an outlet for emotions that are impossible to understand, they are able only to express themselves through song. Music only is capable of building to the same burning intensity as their feelings. Music is able to punch, to kick, to hug, and to kiss, at the intensity that these characters need it to. Music is their release. Additionally, music is used in this show to unite characters through repetition of melody and lyrics, proving that even those who feel like outcasts are not as alone as they may think. Music is also used to carry the plot in a unique and captivating way, so that the importance of certain moments or feelings is obvious and unforgettable. Another Summer is a rock musical that tells the story of lost teenagers who want more than anything to gain a sense of control...|$|R
50|$|Every {{successful}} {{leader and}} organization knows {{that in order}} to maximize profits, it's absolutely imperative to hire and keep the best employees possible. If a business is always looking to maximize profit, it’ll be actively vested in trying to reduce expenses whenever possible—including (alas) employees’ wages. The truth is that most companies pay employees as little as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with. Which is perfect if you want a workforce who will, in turn, provide as little effort as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with.
