40|$|Abstract—Recent {{work for}} single-relay {{channels}} shows that quantize-forward (QF) with long-message encoding achieves <b>the</b> <b>same</b> reliable <b>rates</b> as compress-forward (CF) with short-message encoding. It is shown that short-message QF with backward or pipelined (sliding-window) decoding also achieves <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rates.</b> Similarly, for many relays and sources, short-message QF with backward decoding achieves <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rates</b> as long-message QF. Several practical advantages of short-message encoding are pointed out, e. g., reduced delay and simpler modulation. Fur-thermore, short-message encoding lets relays use decode-forward (DF) if their channel quality is good, thereby enabling multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) gains {{that are not}} possible with long-message encoding. Finally, one may combine the advantages of long- and short-message encoding by hashing a long message to short messages. I...|$|R
5|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between {{the growth rate of}} newly metamorphosed juveniles from different altitudes and latitudes, the specimens studied being from Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France. At first the growth rates for males and females was identical. By the time they became mature their growth rate had slowed down to about 21% of the initial rate and they had reached 95% of their expected adult size. Some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on growing rapidly for a longer time. Adjusting for differences in temperature and the length of the growing season, the toads grew and matured at much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rate</b> from the four colder localities. These juveniles reached maturity after 1.09 years for males and 1.55 years for females. However, the young toads from lowland France grew faster and longer to a much greater size taking an average 1.77 years for males and 2.49 years for females before reaching maturity.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression developed from a tropical wave approximately 1,000mi (1,609.3km) east of Barbados on August 24. After forming, the depression moved westward {{and on the}} next day intensified into a tropical storm on the following day. After becoming a tropical storm, Gustav continued to intensify as it headed west-northwestward. Intensification into a hurricane occurred on August 26, as the storm began slowly curving northward under the influence of a trough. After reaching Category 2 intensity, Gustav was affected by wind shear, and weakened, but eventually re-intensified. The hurricane ultimately peaked as a Category 3 hurricane on August 31, and was also the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, in addition to being the only major hurricane in the Atlantic that year. Around the time of attaining peak intensity, Gustav began a fujiwhara interaction with nearby Tropical Storm Hortense. After attaining peak intensity on August 31, Gustav weakened back, at nearly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rate</b> as it had intensified, and deteriorated to a tropical storm on September 2. By September 3, Gustav transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, 230mi (370km) south of Iceland.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp {{probably}} {{held the}} office of royal forester for Worcestershire as well as sheriff. The evidence {{for this is that}} after Beauchamp's death, his son William was granted the revenues from the royal forests of Worcestershire at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rate</b> as his father had held them; this strongly implies that the elder held {{the office of}} forester. The historian Judith Green felt that Walter de Beauchamp might possibly have held the office of constable, which had been held by his father-in-law, although the historian C. Warren Hollister felt that Beauchamp definitely did hold the office. He also a held the royal office of dispenser, an office which later became known as a butler. He acquired this because his wife inherited the office from her father. The date when he acquired the office is unknown. While a member of the royal household, Beauchamp witnessed a number of royal charters, mainly when the king was in England.|$|E

5|$|For {{its first}} three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which {{it begins to}} forage for {{vegetation}} and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rate</b> as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators {{for at least another}} year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body condition and reproductive ability.|$|E

5|$|Oberlin’s {{compensation}} policies required Stone to do {{twice the}} labor a male student {{had to do}} to pay the same costs. Stone frequently rose at two o'clock to fit in work and study, and she found her health declining. In February 1845, having decided to submit to the injustice no longer, she asked the Faculty Board for the same pay given two lesser-experienced male colleagues. When her request was denied, she resigned her position. Pleading with the faculty to restore Stone, her former students said they would pay Stone “what was right” if the college would not. Stone had planned to borrow money from her father when funds ran out, but Francis Stone, moved by his daughter’s description of her struggles, promised to provide money when needed. Help from home was not needed, however, because after three months of pressure, the faculty yielded and hired Stone back, paying both her and other women student teachers at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rate</b> paid male student teachers.|$|E

5|$|State-owned {{slaves were}} put to work in palaces, offices, workshops, stables, and {{sometimes}} state-owned agricultural fields, while privately owned slaves were employed in domestic services and sometimes farming. However, {{the vast majority of}} non-independent farmers working for wealthy landowners were not hired laborers or slaves, but were landless peasants who paid rent as tenants. It might have been more economically feasible to maintain tenants instead of slaves, since slave masters were obligated to pay an annual poll tax of 240 coins for each slave they owned (<b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rate</b> merchants had to pay for their poll tax). Government slaves were not assigned to work in the government's monopolized industries over iron and salt (which lasted from Emperor Wu's reign until the beginning of Eastern Han). Privately owned slaves were usually assigned to kitchen duty while others fulfilled roles as armed bodyguards, mounted escorts, acrobats, jugglers, dancers, singers, and musicians.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls like Sclerocephalus {{are known}} from both large adult {{specimens}} and small larvae, showing an extreme change in body shape. In these species, {{the shape and}} proportions of skull bones change {{in the early stages}} of development. The ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time. Small, regularly spaced pits are the first to form, followed by larger ridges. As development continues, the external gills disappear. Small teeth that once covered the palate are lost. The postcranial skeleton does not develop at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rate</b> as the skull, with ossification (the replacement of cartilage by bone) happening more slowly. Vertebrae and limb bones are poorly developed, ribs and fingers are absent in the early stages, and the scapulocoracoid and ischium are entirely absent through most of development. Once maturity is reached, most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows. The bones of some temnospondyls like Dutuitosaurus show growth marks, possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons. Fossils of temnospondyls like Metoposaurus and Cheliderpeton show that individuals grew larger past maturity. The oldest individuals usually have more pitting on their skulls with deeper sulci.|$|E
