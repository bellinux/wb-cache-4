5|$|The White House {{travel office}} controversy, {{sometimes}} referred to as Travelgate, was the first major ethics controversy of the Clinton administration. It began in May 1993, when seven employees of the White House Travel Office were fired. This action was unusual because although theoretically staff employees serve at <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> President and could be dismissed without cause, in practice, such employees usually remain in their posts for many years.|$|E

5|$|On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven {{employees}} of the White House Travel Office, causing the White House travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served at <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> president and could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation. Critics contended that the firings {{had been done to}} allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.|$|E
5|$|The College of Arms is a {{corporation}} of thirteen heralds, styled Officers in Ordinary. This thirteen {{can be divided}} hierarchically into three distinctive ranks: three Kings of Arms, six Heralds of Arms and four Pursuivants of Arms. There are also presently seven Officers Extraordinary, who take part in ceremonial occasions but {{are not part of}} the College. As members of the Royal Household, the heralds are appointed at <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sovereign on the recommendation of the Earl Marshal. The Officers in Ordinary are appointed by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the Realm, and the Officers Extraordinary by Royal Sign Manual; all appointments are announced in the London Gazette.|$|E

The office of Blanc Coursier Herald of Arms was attached {{to that of the}} Genealogist, Brunswick Herald of Arms to the Gentleman Usher, and Bath King of Arms was also made Gloucester King of Arms with heraldic jurisdiction over Wales. This {{was the result of a}} move by Anstis to give the holders of these sinecures greater security; the offices of the Order of the Bath were held at <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Master, while appointments to the heraldic offices were made by the King under the Great Seal and were for life.|$|E

5|$|Goebel's and Beckham's {{challenges}} to the election results were received by the General Assembly on January 2. The following day, the Assembly appointed a contest committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges, voter fraud and illegal military intimidation of voters among them. The {{members of the committee}} were drawn at random, although the drawing was likely rigged—only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) The joint committee on the rules recommended that the contest committee report at <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly, that debate was limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of the House would preside over this joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought these provisions, but the Democratic majority passed them over their opposition.|$|E
5|$|When the {{official}} tally was announced, Taylor had {{won by a}} vote of 193,714 to 191,331. Though the Board of Elections was thought to be controlled by Goebel allies, it voted 2–1 to certify the announced vote tally. The board's majority opinion claimed {{that they did not have}} any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899. Goebel announced his decision to contest the board's decision to the General Assembly. The Assembly appointed a committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges. The members of the committee were drawn at random, though the drawing was likely rigged – only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) Among the rules the General Assembly adopted for the contest committee were: that the committee report at <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly, that debate be limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly.
