40|$|Afforestation {{changes the}} land surface energy balance, though {{the effects on}} climate in {{temperate}} regions is uncertain, particularly the changes associated with forest management. In this study, we used idealized Community Earth System Model simulations to assess the influence of afforestation and afforestation management in eastern North America on climate via changes in the biophysics of the land surface. Afforestation using broadleaf deciduous trees maintained at high leaf area index (LAI) {{in the southern part}} of the study region provided the greatest climate benefit by cooling summer surface air temperatures (Tsa). In contrast, the greatest warming occurred in the northern extent of the study region when afforesting with needleleaf evergreen trees maintained at high LAI. Forest management had an equal or greater influence on Tsa than the overall decision <b>to</b> <b>afforest</b> <b>land</b> in the southern extent of the region. Afforestation had a greater influence on Tsa than forest management in the northern extent. Integrating our results, focused on biophysical processes, with other research quantifying carbon cycle sensitivity to management can help guide the use of temperate afforestation to optimize climate benefits. Further, our results highlight the potential importance of including forest management in simulations of past and future climate...|$|E

However, it remains unclear how associated high sunk establishment costs, long-term commitment, highly uncertain net returns, and policy induced incentives could drive farmer's decision <b>to</b> <b>afforest</b> agricultural <b>land.</b> A real option model is used to theoretically frame the decision to switch from agriculture to energy forestry. Optimal investment timing is modeled and the functioning of government subsidies offered {{to speed up the}} switch to energy forestry is analyzed. The empirical analysis examines the establishment of new short-rotation coppice willow stands in Central East Sweden. It is shown that in the presence of volatile agricultural profits and high establishment costs, subsidies are needed to accelerate investment.

40|$|The study investigates farmers' {{decision}} <b>to</b> <b>afforest</b> marginal agricultural <b>land</b> <b>to</b> create {{carbon sinks}} in western Canada. A real option model, which incorporates price risks related to carbon and timber revenues {{as well as}} opportunity cost uncertainty, is {{used to assess the}} impact of a carbon market on farmers' afforestation decision. Irreversibility of the decision is also modeled by including sunk cost of forest establishment and the cost of reversing the afforestation process. In addition, the non-permanence impact on the profitability of afforestation was analyzed by assessing the effect of two non-permanence carbon accounting schemes. Results indicate that both, actual non-permanence policies and the presence of real options, have a significant negative impact on afforestation incentives. However, the carbon market has a positive effect as it increases the expected revenues to afforestation and also represents a diversification opportunity. Yet, even in the presence of a carbon market the investment barrier remains considerable. Despite the positive effect of the carbon market, results show that unless carbon prices reach levels well above $ 100 /tC a subsidization of afforestation cost is needed in order to generate substantial GHG abatement from marginal agricultural land afforestation in western Canada...|$|R

Representative species are chosen for this study. The optimal harvesting age excluding social benefits varies between 32 and 40 years according to the species considered. When including social benefits, optimal harvesting age increases for a carbon price of 20 Euro/t to 34 - 44 years and is close to the one excluding them. The inclusion of subsidies to encourage afforestation shortens the optimal harvesting age to 17 - 20 years from the forest owner's point of view. Interestingly the provision of subsidies contributes to a substantial increase in social loss due to the differences in optimal harvesting ages: starting from zero C price the loss vary between 65 and 165 Euro/ha according to the species used and increases with rising carbon prices up to 200 - 400 Euro/ha for carbon price of 100 Euro/t. Furthermore, results suggest that from the social point of view the profitability of <b>afforesting</b> agricultural <b>land</b> in the study region very much depends on the price of carbon, on the type of agricultural <b>land</b> <b>afforested</b> and on the species used.

Quercus incana and Quercus dilatata are mainly harvested by local communities for fuel and is also less available. Other species such as Corylus avellana and Aesculus indica are disappearing {{as a result of}} crop extension on upland slopes. These trees usually grow in areas with deep soil and high moisture, contribute to soil retention, but are disliked because of their shade cover, which exclude any other form of cropping beneath. Obviously, such good quality land is preferred for extending crop fields. Similarly, Celtis caucasica, Acacia nilotica, Ficus sarmentosa, Debregeasia salicifolia and Artemisia maritima are decreasing because of the utility of these species as fuel by landowner groups, particularly if found in the vicinity of settlements. The growing cover by Ailanthus chinensis is due to high pollination and germination ability, whereas Grewia oppositifolia is planted at an increasing rate by landowner farmers on the field boundaries for fodder. The population of Dodonaea viscosa remains stable, despite extensive harvesting for its use as fuel in tobacco processing and for household fuel, since it has a high pollination and reproducibility.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{carbon leakage}} due to reduced emissions from deforestation (RED). We find that leakage with RED is good because the policy induces afforestation {{that contributes to}} a further carbon sequestration. By ignoring the domestic component of carbon leakage, the literature can either overestimate or underestimate leakage, depending on the magnitudes of the numerator and the denominator of the leakage formulas. Unlike the literature, we include the land and agricultural markets {{in the analysis of}} carbon leakage with forestation policies. In this model, carbon leakage depends on: (1) supply and demand elasticities of timber production and consumption, respectively in the country introducing a RED policy (Home country) and {{in the rest of the}} world; (2) Home country’s production and consumption share in the world timber production and consumption, respectively; (3) prices of land and crop products in the Home country and the rest of the world; (4) initial allocation of land between forestry and agriculture; (5) share of total forest area set aside under RED; and (6) relative carbon sequestration potential of the forest planted on an <b>afforested</b> <b>land</b> and of the forest withdrawn from timber harvest. These potentials depend heavily on the forest species as well as on timing of the policy, and on the discount rate and time path of increasing carbon prices. carbon leakage, forestry, reduced emissions from deforestation, afforestation, Agricultural and Food Policy, Environmental Economics and Policy, Land Economics/Use, Q 23, Q 24, Q 54,...|$|R

However, the downturn in the Irish economy has led to a reduction in the availability of off-farm employment and also the discontinuation of REPS. This may lead to an increase in afforestation on Irish farms, as forestry offers greater certainty through the provision of an annual premium in addition to the SFP.

The objective was to determine the best aspect on the tree, number of needle age classes, and number of trees that would best predict top height in these plantations at age 20. Needles were sampled from thirty subplots representative of the geographical and productivity range of this species. On the fifth whorl of each sample tree, random groups of 10 fascicles were collected from various trees, aspects, and age classes and measured for average needle length. Total height, height to the first and sixth whorls above breast height and diameter at breast height were measured on each sample tree. Weighted simple linear regression models quantified the relationship between needle length and top height of the stand at 20 years, with top height specified as the mean height of four possible stand components. Mean needle lengths were computed as plot-level means for each age class-aspect combination as well as plot-level means for 2 - to 5 -consecutive years by aspect. To assess for the necessity of sampling from a fixed aspect, the null hypothesis of no differences between aspects was tested on a plantation-, plot-, and tree-level. Only the current year's needle lengths had a significant difference in needle lengths (NL) between NW and SE aspects. The stand component representing the 100 -most dominant stems per hectare by diameter was selected for the final model because on average this dimension was more reliably predicted. Because precipitation is thought to have an effect on needle length, and because precipitation fluctuates widely between years, it is advisable to measure as many age classes of needles as possible to obtain accurate estimates of potential site productivity...|$|R

Conceptually, these potential hazards are similar in that their occurrence at any time t is uncertain and landowners can take specific actions – although generally different actions - in any time period t to reduce the probability of sustaining losses related to them. The hazards differ, however, in that fire represents a large loss in carbon at a moment in time, while insect/disease infestations {{are more likely to be}} reflected in a period of significant slowing of the rate of carbon accumulation than was anticipated followed by a sustained period of slowly decreasing carbon losses. The nature of these losses will influence the design of incentives under GHG mitigation frameworks that require carbon losses to be replaced as well as the strategies farmers adopt to deal with the uncertainties associated with these events occurring. carbon sequestration, uncertainty, optimal control, hazard function, forestry, permanence, Environmental Economics and Policy, Land Economics/Use,...|$|R
