5|$|After {{completing}} {{an internship}} {{and a trip}} abroad for postgraduate studies, DeLee was ready {{to set up a}} medical practice by the age of 25. Noting that obstetric care in Chicago was often inadequate, he opened a clinic on Chicago's Maxwell Street after consulting with <b>the</b> <b>noted</b> social worker Jane Addams. Early on, DeLee provided prenatal care to the neighborhood's women, but the babies were delivered by midwives in the area. Over time, hundreds of women began having their babies delivered by DeLee.|$|E
5|$|Important {{contributions}} {{were made}} by some prominent literary families. One Jain family produced several authors, including Mallikarjuna, <b>the</b> <b>noted</b> anthologist (1245); his brother-in-law Janna (1209), the court poet of King Veera Ballala II; Mallikarjuna's son Keshiraja (1260), considered by D. R. Nagaraj, a scholar on literary cultures in history, {{to be the greatest}} theorist of Kannada grammar; and Sumanobana, who was in the court of King Narasimha I and was the maternal grandfather of Keshiraja. Harihara (1160) and his nephew Raghavanka (1200), poets who set the trend for using native metres, came from a Shaiva family (devotees of the god Shiva).|$|E
5|$|In 1768, {{civil war}} {{broke out in the}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, when the Bar Confederation sought to depose King Stanisław August Poniatowski. One of Kościuszko's brothers, Józef, fought {{on the side of the}} insurgents. Faced with a {{difficult}} choice between the rebels and his sponsors—the King and the Czartoryski family, who favored a gradualist approach to shedding Russian domination—Kościuszko chose to leave Poland. In late 1769, he and a colleague, <b>the</b> <b>noted</b> artist Aleksander Orłowski, were granted royal scholarships, and on October 5 they set off for Paris. They wanted to further their military education, but as foreigners they were barred from enrolling in French military academies, and so they enrolled instead in the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. There Kościuszko pursued his interest in drawing and painting and took private lessons in architecture from <b>the</b> <b>noted</b> French architect Jean-Rodolphe Perronet.|$|E

His Géométrographie and {{relation}} of equations to tetrahedrons and triangles, {{as well as}} his study of concurrencies and concyclities, contributed to the modern triangle geometry of the time. The definition of points of the triangle such as the Lemoine point was also a staple of the geometry, and other modern triangle geometers such as Brocard and Gaston Tarry wrote about similar points.|$|E
5|$|Percy Powell-Cotton {{was born}} in 1866, and was a Major in the Northumberland Fusiliers. His expeditions were {{conducted}} for scientific research, and would sometimes take 18 months. In 1896, Major Powell-Cotton founded the Powell-Cotton Museum at Quex Park to display his collection of mammals and artefacts acquired on his expeditions to Africa and Asia. The animals were mounted by <b>the</b> <b>noted</b> taxidermist Rowland Ward.|$|E
5|$|Sunday never {{attended}} seminary {{and made}} no pretense of being a theologian or an intellectual, {{but he had a}} thorough knowledge of the Bible and was well read on religious and social issues of his day. His surviving Winona Lake library of six hundred books gives evidence of heavy use, including underscoring and reader's notes in his characteristic all-caps printing. Some of Sunday's books were even those of religious opponents. He was later charged with plagiarizing a Decoration Day speech given by <b>the</b> <b>noted</b> agnostic Robert Ingersoll.|$|E

The speech itself was dramatized in the 2000 film, Lumumba, directed by Raoul Peck in which Eriq Ebouaney {{played the role of}} Lumumba. It was backed by a specially composed score, entitled Le Discours ("The Speech"), by the French composer Jean-Claude Petit.|$|E
5|$|The {{works of}} William Shakespeare enjoyed a renewed {{popularity}} in 18th-century Britain. Several new editions {{of his works}} were published, his plays were revived in the theatre and numerous works of art were created illustrating the plays and specific productions of them. Capitalising on this interest, Boydell decided to publish a grand illustrated edition of Shakespeare's plays that would showcase the talents of British painters and engravers. He chose <b>the</b> <b>noted</b> scholar and Shakespeare editor George Steevens to oversee the edition, which was released between 1791 and 1803.|$|E
5|$|William de Corbeil was {{probably}} born at Corbeil on the Seine, possibly in about 1070.

William taught for a time at Laon, but nothing else is known of his early life. All that is known of his parents or ancestry is that he had two brothers, Ranulf and Helgot; his brothers appear as witnesses on William's charters.|$|E

5|$|At these concerts, Bache {{frequently}} {{appeared as}} soloist, accompanist or conductor, {{but he also}} engaged other artists {{in an attempt to}} show he was not giving the concerts out of self-aggrandizement. Bülow conducted two concerts, Edward Dannreuther led the orchestra in two concerts. August Manns, the conductor of a series of orchestral concerts held at the Crystal Palace and an admirer of Liszt's works, led four concerts. The majority of instrumentalists engaged were also members of the Crystal Palace orchestra to ensure the level of performance was as high as possible. Among guest soloists was <b>the</b> <b>noted</b> violinist August Wilhelmj, who played the Bach Chaconne in D minor at one concert.|$|E
5|$|Brock {{continually}} {{kept the}} commanders of his posts informed of all developments. When {{news of the}} outbreak of war reached him, he sent a canoe party under <b>the</b> <b>noted</b> trader and voyager William McKay to the British outpost at St. Joseph Island on Lake Huron. His orders to commander (Captain Charles Roberts) allowed him {{to stand on the}} defensive or attack the nearby American outpost at Fort Mackinac at his discretion. Roberts immediately launched an attack on Fort Mackinac with a scratch force of regulars, fur traders, and First Nations warriors. On 17 July, the American garrison was taken by surprise (not being aware that war had been declared) and surrendered. This victory immediately encouraged many First Nations tribes, who had hitherto been neutral or undecided, to give their active support to the British. They hoped to expel the American settlers from their territories west of the Appalachian Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Chagas {{named the}} {{pathogenic}} parasite as Trypanosoma cruzi and {{later that year}} as Schizotrypanum cruzi, both honoring Oswaldo Cruz, <b>the</b> <b>noted</b> Brazilian physician and epidemiologist who successfully fought epidemics of yellow fever, smallpox, and bubonic plague in Rio de Janeiro and other cities {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century. Chagas was also the first to unknowingly discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus Pneumocystis, later infamously linked to PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia in AIDS victims). Confusion between the two pathogens' life-cycles led him to briefly recognize his genus Schizotrypanum, but following the description of Pneumocystis by others as an independent genus, Chagas returned to the use of the name Trypanosoma cruzi.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea {{have only}} had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since the team's foundation. It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 {{and for the first}} 28 years of its {{existence}} it was used almost exclusively by the London Athletic Club as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football. In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman Gus Mears and his brother Joseph, who had also purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5acre (51,000m²) site. Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by <b>the</b> <b>noted</b> football architect Archibald Leitch, who had also designed Ibrox, Craven Cottage and Hampden Park. Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.|$|E
5|$|From 1945 onwards, Britain {{conducted}} {{a number of}} studies into the properties and use of variable geometry wings. <b>The</b> <b>noted</b> British engineer and inventor Sir Barnes Wallis began exploring the concept during the Second World War and became an early pioneer and advocate for the variable geometry wing, conceiving of an aircraft consideration that lacked conventional features such as a vertical stabiliser and rudder, instead using variable geometry wings to provide primary controllability in their place. In 1946, Wallis published a paper upon this research, which was quickly hailed as being a major scientific breakthrough in the aviation industry. Wallis proceeded to advocate for the production of an aircraft, military or civil, that would take advantage of a variable geometry wing. The Ministry of Supply and Ministry of Defence arranged for a series of tests to demonstrate the application of the technology to projectiles, both for research purposes and a potential form of anti-aircraft defence; while Wallis worked upon this research programme, he continued to promote the concept of a manned variable geometry aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1896 Synge visited Italy {{to study}} the {{language}} for a time before returning to Paris. Later that year he met W. B.

That year he joined with Yeats, Augusta, Lady Gregory, and George William Russell to form the Irish National Theatre Society, which later established the Abbey Theatre. He also wrote some pieces of literary criticism for Gonne's Irlande Libre and other journals, as well as unpublished poems and prose in a decadent fin de siècle style. (These writings were eventually gathered in the 1960s for his Collected Works.) He also attended lectures at the Sorbonne by <b>the</b> <b>noted</b> Celtic scholar Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville.|$|E
