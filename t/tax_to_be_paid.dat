25|$|In 1883, President Chester A. Arthur {{signed the}} Tariff Act of March 3, 1883, {{requiring}} a <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> on imported vegetables, but not fruit. The John Nix & Co. company filed a suit by against Edward L. Hedden, Collector of the Port of New York, to recover back duties paid under protest. They argued against the tariff {{by pointing out}} that, botanically, a tomato is a fruit due to its seed-bearing structure growing from the flowering part of a plant.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the year}} 2000, Sweden had a {{mandatory}} church <b>tax,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> if one did {{belong to the}} Church of Sweden, which had been funneling about $500 million annually to the church. Because of change in legislation, the tax was withdrawn in the year 2000. However, the Swedish government has agreed to continue collecting from individual taxpayers the annual payment that has always gone to the church. But now the tax will be an optional checkoff box on the tax return. The government will allocate the money collected to Catholic, Muslim, Jewish and other faiths {{as well as the}} Lutherans, with each taxpayer directing where his or her taxes should go.|$|E
25|$|Walter Allen Watson of Nottoway County, was {{the sitting}} Commonwealth’s Attorney {{and a member}} of the Martin machine’s Democratic State Committee; he would later serve at a Virginia Circuit Court Judge. Watson held that the purpose of the Convention {{movement}} in Virginia as endorsed in popular referendum was “the elimination of the negro from the politics of this state.” The majority of the Convention quickly followed his lead by adopting a two-stage restriction of the electorate. First, for one year, property qualifications were reinstated, this time allowing any male citizen paying one dollar in property tax to vote, along with any Civil War veteran, or the son of a veteran, blue or grey, white or black. The second step was imposition of a poll <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> for three consecutive years annually prior to voting.|$|E

25|$|He {{introduced}} {{ideas that}} indirectly challenged the discriminatory taxes imposed by Islamic authorities. For example, Aurangzeb had imposed taxes on non-Muslims that {{were collected from}} the Sikhs as well, for example the jizya (poll tax on non-Muslims), pilgrim tax and Bhaddar tax – the last being a <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> by anyone following the Hindu ritual of shaving the head {{after the death of}} a loved one and cremation. Guru Gobind Singh declared that Khalsa do not need to continue this practice, because Bhaddar is not dharam, but a bharam (illusion). Not shaving the head also meant not having to pay the taxes by Sikhs who lived in Delhi {{and other parts of the}} Mughal Empire. However, the new code of conduct also led to internal disagreements between Sikhs in the 18th century, particularly between the Nanakpanthi and the Khalsa.|$|E

2500|$|When General Zia ul-Haq, {{the former}} {{military}} ruler of Pakistan, introduced new laws to make Zakat deductions mandatory for every Muslim during the 1980s, Tehrik-e-Jafaria held a large public demonstration in Islamabad {{to compel the}} government to exempt the Shia Muslim community from this law. This protest resulted in the [...] "Islamabad Agreement" [...] {{in which the government}} agreed to introduce a separate syllabus for Shia students in public schools, as well as exempt the Shia community from the Zakat law, since Shia consider Zakat as a personal <b>tax</b> (<b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> to the needy) not collectible by the state. According to one senior Pakistani journalist who witnessed these events, Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini {{played an important role in}} this agreement being reached, and he sought assurances from General Zia al-Haq that Shia demands would be met. A message from Ayatollah Khomeini was also read out to the Shia protesters in Islamabad in which he called for them to keep up their spirits.|$|E

[...] "Always remember, Mr. Robarts, that {{when you go into}} an attorney's office door, you will have to pay for it, first or last.

60|$|The sophisters and declaimers, {{as soon as}} the Assembly met, {{began with}} decrying the ancient {{constitution}} of the revenue in many of its most essential branches, such as the public monopoly of salt. They charged it, as truly as unwisely, with being ill-contrived, oppressive, and partial. This representation they were not satisfied to make use of in speeches preliminary to some plan of reform; they declared it in a solemn resolution or public sentence, as it were judicially passed upon it; and this they dispersed throughout the nation. At the time they passed the decree, with the same gravity they ordered the same absurd, oppressive, and partial <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid,</b> until they could find a revenue to replace it. The consequence was inevitable. The provinces which had been always exempted from this salt monopoly, some of whom were charged with other contributions, perhaps equivalent, were totally disinclined to bear any part of the burden, which by an equal distribution was to redeem the others. As to the Assembly, occupied as it was with the declaration and violation of the rights of men, and with their arrangements for general confusion, it had neither leisure nor capacity to contrive, nor authority to enforce, any plan of any kind relative to the replacing the tax, or equalizing it, or compensating the provinces, or for conducting their minds to any scheme of accommodation with the other districts which were to be relieved. The people of the salt provinces, impatient under taxes damned by the authority which had directed their payment, very soon found their patience exhausted. They thought themselves as skilful in demolishing as the Assembly could be. They relieved themselves by throwing off the whole burden. Animated by this example, each district, or part of a district, judging of its own grievance by its own feeling, and of its remedy by its own opinion, did as it pleased with other taxes.|$|E
