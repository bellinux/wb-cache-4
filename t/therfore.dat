But think not here [...] To trouble Holy Rest; Heav'n casts thee out [...] From all her Confines. Heav'n the seat of bliss [...] Brooks not the works of violence and Warr. [...] Hence then, and evil go with thee along [...] Thy ofspring, {{to the place of}} evil, Hell, [...] Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles, [...] Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome, [...] Or som more sudden vengeance wing'd from God [...] Precipitate thee with augmented paine. [...] 280 [...] So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus [...] The Adversarie. Nor think thou with wind [...] Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds [...] Thou canst not.

[...] They ended parle, and both addrest for fight [...] Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue [...] Of Angels, can relate, or to what things [...] Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift [...] Human imagination to such highth [...] 300 [...] Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd, [...] Stood they or mov'd, in stature, motion, arms [...] Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav'n. [...] Now wav'd thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire [...] Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields [...] Blaz'd opposite, while expectation stood [...] In horror; from each hand with speed retir'd [...] Where erst was thickest fight, th' Angelic throng, [...] And left large field, unsafe within the wind [...] Of such commotion, such as to set forth [...] 310 [...] Great things by small, If Natures concord broke, [...] Among the Constellations warr were sprung, [...] Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne [...] Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie, [...] Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound. [...] Together both with next to Almightie Arme, [...] Uplifted imminent one stroke they aim'd [...] That might determine, and not need repeate, [...] As not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd [...] In might or swift prevention; but the sword [...] 320 [...] Of Michael from the Armorie of God [...] Was giv'n him temperd so, that neither keen [...] Nor solid might resist that edge: it met [...] The sword of Satan with steep force to smite [...] Descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid, [...] But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar'd [...] All his right side; then Satan first knew pain, [...] And writh'd him to and fro convolv'd; so sore [...] The griding sword with discontinuous wound [...] Pass'd through him, but th' Ethereal substance clos'd [...] 330 [...] Not long divisible, and from the gash [...] A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow'd [...] Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed, [...] And all his Armour staind ere while so bright. [...] Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run [...] By Angels many and strong, who interpos'd [...] Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields [...] Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir'd [...] From off the files of warr; there they him laid [...] Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame [...] 340 [...] To find himself not matchless, and his pride [...] Humbl'd by such rebuke, so farr beneath [...] His confidence to equal God in power. [...] Yet soon he heal'd; for Spirits that live throughout [...] Vital in every part, not as frail man [...] In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines, [...] Cannot but by annihilating die; [...] Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound [...] Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire: [...] All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare, [...] 350 [...] All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please, [...] They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size [...] Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare. [...] Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd [...] Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought, [...] And with fierce Ensignes pierc'd the deep array [...] Of Moloc furious King, who him defi'd, [...] And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound [...] Threatn'd, nor from the Holie One of Heav'n [...] Refrein'd his tongue blasphemous; but anon [...] 360 [...] Down clov'n to the waste, with shatterd Armes [...] And uncouth paine fled bellowing. On each wing [...] Uriel and Raphael his vaunting foe, [...] Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd, [...] Vanquish'd Adramelec, and Asmadai, [...] Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods [...] Disdain'd, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight, [...] Mangl'd with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile. [...] Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy [...] The Atheist crew, but with redoubl'd blow [...] 370 [...] Ariel and Arioc, and the violence [...] Of Ramiel scorcht and blasted overthrew. [...] I might relate of thousands, and thir names [...] Eternize here on Earth; but those elect [...] Angels contented with thir fame in Heav'n [...] Seek not the praise of men: the other sort [...] In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr, [...] Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome [...] Canceld from Heav'n and sacred memorie, [...] Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell. [...] 380 [...] For strength from Truth divided and from Just, [...] Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise [...] And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires [...] Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame: [...] <b>Therfore</b> Eternal silence be thir doome. [...] And now thir mightiest quelld, the battel swerv'd, [...] With many an inrode gor'd; deformed rout [...] Enter'd, and foul disorder; all the ground [...] With shiverd armour strow'n, and on a heap [...] Chariot and Charioter lay overturnd [...] 390 [...] And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld [...] Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host [...] Defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris'd, [...] Then first with fear surpris'd and sense of paine [...] Fled ignominious, to such evil brought [...] By sinne of disobedience, till that hour [...] Not liable to fear or flight or paine. [...] Far otherwise th' inviolable Saints [...] In Cubic Phalanx firm advanc't entire, [...] Invulnerable, impenitrably arm'd: [...] 400 [...] Such high advantages thir innocence [...] Gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd, [...] Not to have disobei'd; in fight they stood [...] Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain'd [...] By wound, though from thir place by violence mov'd. [...] Now Night her course began, and over Heav'n [...] Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos'd, [...] And silence on the odious dinn of Warr: [...] Under her Cloudie covert both retir'd, [...] Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field [...] 410 [...] Michael and his Angels prevalent [...] Encamping, plac'd in Guard thir Watches round, [...] Cherubic waving fires: on th' other part [...] Satan with his rebellious disappeerd, [...] Far in the dark dislodg'd, and void of rest, [...] His Potentates to Councel call'd by night; [...] And in the midst thus undismai'd began. [...] O now in danger tri'd, now known in Armes [...] Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare, [...] Found worthy not of Libertie alone, [...] 420 [...] Too mean pretense, but what we more affect, [...] Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne, [...] Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight, [...] (And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?) [...] What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send [...] Against us from about his Throne, and judg'd [...] Sufficient to subdue us to his will, [...] But proves not so: then fallible, it seems, [...] Of future we may deem him, though till now [...] Omniscient thought. True is, less firmly arm'd, [...] 430 [...] Some disadvantage we endur'd and paine, [...] Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd, [...] Since now we find this our Empyreal forme [...] Incapable of mortal injurie [...] Imperishable, and though peirc'd with wound, [...] Soon closing, and by native vigour heal'd. [...] Of evil then so small as easie think [...] The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes, [...] Weapons more violent, when next we meet, [...] May serve to better us, and worse our foes, [...] 440 [...] Or equal what between us made the odds, [...] In Nature none: if other hidden cause [...] Left them Superiour, while we can preserve [...] Unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound, [...] Due search and consultation will disclose. [...] He sat; and in th' assembly next upstood [...] Nisroc, of Principalities the prime; [...] As one he stood escap't from cruel fight, [...] Sore toild, his riv'n Armes to havoc hewn, [...] And cloudie in aspect thus answering spake. [...] 450 [...] Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free [...] Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard [...] For Gods, and too unequal work we find [...] Against unequal armes to fight in paine, [...] Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil [...] Ruin must needs ensue; for what availes [...] Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain [...] Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands [...] Of Mightiest. Sense of pleasure we may well [...] Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine, [...] 460 [...] But live content, which is the calmest life: [...] But pain is perfet miserie, the worst [...] Of evils, and excessive, overturnes [...] All patience. He who therefore can invent [...] With what more forcible we may offend [...] Our yet unwounded Enemies, or arme [...] Our selves with like defence, to mee deserves [...] No less then for deliverance what we owe. [...] Whereto with look compos'd Satan repli'd. [...] Not uninvented that, which thou aright [...] 470 [...] Beleivst so main to our success, I bring; [...] Which of us who beholds the bright surface [...] Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand, [...] This continent of spacious Heav'n, adornd [...] With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms & Gold, [...] Whose Eye so superficially surveyes [...] These things, as not to mind from whence they grow [...] Deep under ground, materials dark and crude, [...] Of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht [...] With Heav'ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth [...] 480 [...] So beauteous, op'ning to the ambient light. [...] These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep [...] Shall yeild us, pregnant with infernal flame, [...] Which into hallow Engins long and round [...] Thick-rammd, at th' other bore with touch of fire [...] Dilated and infuriate shall send forth [...] From far with thundring noise among our foes [...] Such implements of mischief as shall dash [...] To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands [...] Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd [...] 490 [...] The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt. [...] Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne, [...] Effect shall end our wish. Mean while revive; [...] Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind [...] Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird. [...] He ended, and his words thir drooping chere [...] Enlightn'd, and thir languisht hope reviv'd. [...] Th' invention all admir'd, and each, how hee [...] To be th' inventer miss'd, so easie it seemd [...] Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought [...] 500 [...] Impossible: yet haply of thy Race [...] In future dayes, if Malice should abound, [...] Some one intent on mischief, or inspir'd [...] With dev'lish machination might devise [...] Like instrument to plague the Sons of men [...] For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent. [...] Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew, [...] None arguing stood, innumerable hands [...] Were ready, in a moment up they turnd [...] Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath [...] 510 [...] Th' originals of Nature in thir crude [...] Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame [...] They found, they mingl'd, and with suttle Art, [...] Concocted and adusted they reduc'd [...] To blackest grain, and into store conveyd: [...] Part hidd'n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth [...] Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone, [...] Whereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls [...] Of missive ruin; part incentive reed [...] Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire. [...] 520 [...] So all ere day spring, under conscious Night [...] Secret they finish'd, and in order set, [...] With silent circumspection unespi'd. [...] Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav'n appeerd [...] Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms [...] The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood [...] Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host, [...] Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills [...] Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure, [...] Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe, [...] 530 [...] Where lodg'd, or whither fled, or if for fight, [...] In motion or in alt: him soon they met [...] Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow [...] But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail [...] Zephiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing, [...] Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri'd. [...] Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand, [...] Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit [...] This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud [...] He comes, and settl'd in his face I see [...] 540 [...] Sad resolution and secure: let each [...] His Adamantine coat gird well, and each [...] Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield, [...] Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down, [...] If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr, [...] But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire. [...] So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon [...] In order, quit of all impediment; [...] Instant without disturb they took Allarm, [...] And onward move Embattelld; when behold [...] 550 [...] Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe [...] Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube [...] Training his devilish Enginrie, impal'd [...] On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep, [...] To hide the fraud. At interview both stood [...] A while, but suddenly at head appeerd [...] Satan: And thus was heard Commanding loud. [...] Vangard, to Right and Left the Front unfould; [...] That all may see who hate us, how we seek [...] Peace and composure, and with open brest [...] 560 [...] Stand readie to receive them, if they like [...] Our overture, and turn not back perverse; [...] But that I doubt, however witness Heaven, [...] Heav'n witness thou anon, while we discharge [...] Freely our part: yee who appointed stand [...] Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch [...] What we propound, and loud that all may hear. [...] So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce [...] Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front [...] Divided, and to either Flank retir'd. [...] 570 [...] Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange, [...] A triple-mounted row of Pillars laid [...] On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem'd [...] Or hollow'd bodies made of Oak or Firr [...] With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell'd) [...] Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes [...] With hideous orifice gap't on us wide, [...] Portending hollow truce; at each behind [...] A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed [...] Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense, [...] 580 [...] Collected stood within our thoughts amus'd, [...] Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds [...] Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli'd [...] With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame, [...] But soon obscur'd with smoak, all Heav'n appeerd, [...] From those deep-throated Engins belcht, whose roar [...] Emboweld with outragious noise the Air, [...] And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule [...] Thir devillish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail [...] Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host [...] 590 [...] Level'd, with such impetuous furie smote, [...] That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand, [...] Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell [...] By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl'd; [...] The sooner for thir Arms, unarm'd they might [...] Have easily as Spirits evaded swift [...] By quick contraction or remove; but now [...] Foule dissipation follow'd and forc't rout; [...] Nor serv'd it to relax thir serried files. [...] What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse [...] 600 [...] Repeated, and indecent overthrow [...] Doubl'd, would render them yet more despis'd, [...] And to thir foes a laughter; for in view [...] Stood rankt of Seraphim another row [...] In posture to displode thir second tire [...] Of Thunder: back defeated to return [...] They worse abhorr'd. Satan beheld thir plight, [...] And to his Mates thus in derision call'd. [...] O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud? [...] Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee, [...] 610 [...] To entertain them fair with open Front [...] And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms [...] Of composition, strait they chang'd thir minds, [...] Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell, [...] As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd [...] Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps [...] For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose [...] If our proposals once again were heard [...] We should compel them to a quick result. [...] To whom thus Belial in like gamesom mood. [...] 620 [...] Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight, [...] Of hard contents, and full of force urg'd home, [...] Such as we might perceive amus'd them all, [...] And stumbl'd many, who receives them right, [...] Had need from head to foot well understand; [...] Not understood, this gift they have besides, [...] They shew us when our foes walk not upright. [...] So they among themselves in pleasant veine [...] Stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond [...] All doubt of Victorie, eternal might [...] 630 [...] To match with thir inventions they presum'd [...] So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn, [...] And all his Host derided, while they stood [...] A while in trouble; but they stood not long, [...] Rage prompted them at length, & found them arms [...] Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. [...] Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power [...] Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac'd) [...] Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills [...] (For Earth hath this variety from Heav'n [...] 640 [...] Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale) [...] Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew, [...] From thir foundations loosning to and fro [...] They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load, [...] Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops [...] Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze, [...] Be sure, and terrour seis'd the rebel Host, [...] When coming towards them so dread they saw [...] The bottom of the Mountains upward turn'd, [...] Till on those cursed Engins triple-row [...] 650 [...] They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence [...] Under the weight of Mountains buried deep, [...] Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads [...] Main Promontories flung, which in the Air [...] Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm'd, [...] Thir armor help'd thir harm, crush't in and brus'd [...] Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain [...] Implacable, and many a dolorous groan, [...] Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind [...] Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, [...] 660 [...] Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. [...] The rest in imitation to like Armes [...] Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore; [...] So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills [...] Hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire, [...] That under ground they fought in dismal shade; [...] Infernal noise; Warr seem'd a civil Game [...] To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt [...] Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav'n [...] Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred, [...] 670 [...] Had not th' Almightie Father where he sits [...] Shrin'd in his Sanctuarie of Heav'n secure, [...] Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen [...] This tumult, and permitted all, advis'd: [...] That his great purpose he might so fulfill, [...] To honour his Anointed Son aveng'd [...] Upon his enemies, and to declare [...] All power on him transferr'd: whence to his Son [...] Th' Assessor of his Throne he thus began. [...] Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov'd, [...] 680 [...] Son in whose face invisible is beheld [...] Visibly, what by Deitie I am, [...] And in whose hand what by Decree I doe, [...] Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past, [...] Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav'n, [...] Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame [...] These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight, [...] As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm'd; [...] For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst, [...] Equal in their Creation they were form'd, [...] 690 [...] Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought [...] Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom; [...] Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last [...] Endless, and no solution will be found: [...] Warr wearied hath perform'd what Warr can do, [...] And to disorder'd rage let loose the reines, [...] With Mountains as with Weapons arm'd, which makes [...] Wild work in Heav'n, and dangerous to the maine. [...] Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine; [...] For thee I have ordain'd it, and thus farr [...] 700 [...] Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine [...] Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou [...] Can end it. Into thee such Vertue and Grace [...] Immense I have transfus'd, that all may know [...] In Heav'n and Hell thy Power above compare, [...] And this perverse Commotion governd thus, [...] To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir [...] Of all things, to be Heir and to be King [...] By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right. [...] Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might, [...] 710 [...] Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles [...] That shake Heav'ns basis, bring forth all my Warr, [...] My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms [...] Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh; [...] Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out [...] From all Heav'ns bounds into the utter Deep: [...] There let them learn, as likes them, to despise [...] God and Messiah his anointed King. [...] He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct [...] Shon full, he all his Father full exprest [...] 720 [...] Ineffably into his face receiv'd, [...] And thus the filial Godhead answering spake. [...] O Father, O Supream of heav'nly Thrones, [...] First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst [...] To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee, [...] As is most just; this I my Glorie account, [...] My exaltation, and my whole delight, [...] That thou in me well pleas'd, declarst thy will [...] Fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss. [...] Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume, [...] 730 [...] And gladlier shall resign, when in the end [...] Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee [...] For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov'st: [...] But whom thou hat'st, I hate, and can put on [...] Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on, [...] Image of thee in all things; and shall soon, [...] Armd with thy might, rid heav'n of these rebell'd, [...] To thir prepar'd ill Mansion driven down [...] To chains of Darkness, and th' undying Worm, [...] That from thy just obedience could revolt, [...] 740 [...] Whom to obey is happiness entire. [...] Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th' impure [...] Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount [...] Unfained Halleluiahs to thee sing, [...] Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief. [...] So said, he o're his Scepter bowing, rose [...] From the right hand of Glorie where he sate, [...] And the third sacred Morn began to shine [...] Dawning through Heav'n: forth rush'd with whirlwind sound [...] The Chariot of Paternal Deitie, [...] 750 [...] Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn, [...] It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd [...] By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each [...] Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all [...] And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the Wheels [...] Of Beril, and careering Fires between; [...] Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament, [...] Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure [...] Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch. [...] Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd [...] 760 [...] Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, [...] Ascended, at his right hand Victorie [...] Sate Eagle-wing'd, beside him hung his Bow [...] And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor'd, [...] And from about him fierce Effusion rowld [...] Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire; [...] Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, [...] He onward came, farr off his coming shon, [...] And twentie thousand (I thir number heard) [...] Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen: [...] 770 [...] Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime [...] On the Crystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron'd. [...] Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own [...] First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz'd, [...] When the great Ensign of Messiah blaz'd [...] Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav'n: [...] Under whose Conduct Michael soon reduc'd [...] His Armie, circumfus'd on either Wing, [...] Under thir Head imbodied all in one. [...] Before him Power Divine his way prepar'd; [...] 780 [...] At his command the uprooted Hills retir'd [...] Each to his place, they heard his voice and went [...] Obsequious, Heav'n his wonted face renewd, [...] And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil'd. [...] This saw his hapless Foes, but stood obdur'd, [...] And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers [...] Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. [...] In heav'nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? [...] But to convince the proud what Signs availe, [...] Or Wonders move th' obdurate to relent? [...] 790 [...] They hard'nd more by what might most reclame, [...] Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight [...] Took envie, and aspiring to his highth, [...] Stood reimbattell'd fierce, by force or fraud [...] Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile [...] Against God and Messiah, or to fall [...] In universal ruin last, and now [...] To final Battel drew, disdaining flight, [...] Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God [...] To all his Host on either hand thus spake. [...] 800 [...] Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand [...] Ye Angels arm'd, this day from Battel rest; [...] Faithful hath been your Warfare, and of God [...] Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause, [...] And as ye have receivd, so have ye don [...] Invincibly; but of this cursed crew [...] The punishment to other hand belongs, [...] Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints; [...] Number to this dayes work is not ordain'd [...] Nor multitude, stand onely and behold [...] 810 [...] Gods indignation on these Godless pourd [...] By mee; not you but mee they have despis'd, [...] Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage, [...] Because the Father, t' whom in Heav'n supream [...] Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains, [...] Hath honourd me according to his will. [...] Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig'n'd; [...] That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee [...] In Battel which the stronger proves, they all, [...] Or I alone against them, since by strength [...] 820 [...] They measure all, of other excellence [...] Not emulous, nor care who them excells; [...] Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe. [...] So spake the Son, and into terrour chang'd [...] His count'nance too severe to be beheld [...] And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies. [...] At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings [...] With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes [...] Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound [...] Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host. [...] 830 [...] Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove, [...] Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles [...] The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout, [...] All but the Throne it self of God. Full soon [...] Among them he arriv'd; in his right hand [...] Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent [...] Before him, such as in thir Soules infix'd [...] Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost, [...] All courage; down thir idle weapons drop'd; [...] O're Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode [...] 840 [...] Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, [...] That wish'd the Mountains now might be again [...] Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire. [...] Nor less on either side tempestuous fell [...] His arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd Foure, [...] Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels, [...] Distinct alike with multitude of eyes, [...] One Spirit in them rul'd, and every eye [...] Glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire [...] Among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength, [...] 850 [...] And of thir wonted vigour left them draind, [...] Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n. [...] Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd [...] His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant [...] Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav'n: [...] The overthrown he rais'd, and as a Heard [...] Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd [...] Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu'd [...] With terrors and with furies to the bounds [...] And Chrystall wall of Heav'n, which op'ning wide, [...] 860 [...] Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos'd [...] Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight [...] Strook them with horror backward, but far worse [...] Urg'd them behind; headlong themselvs they threw [...] Down from the verge of Heav'n, Eternal wrauth [...] Burnt after them to the bottomless pit. [...] Hell heard th' unsufferable noise, Hell saw [...] Heav'n ruining from Heav'n and would have fled [...] Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep [...] Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. [...] 870 [...] Nine dayes they fell; confounded Chaos roard, [...] And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall [...] Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout [...] Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last [...] Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos'd, [...] Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire [...] Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine. [...] Disburd'nd Heav'n rejoic'd, and soon repaird [...] Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld. [...] Sole Victor from th' expulsion of his Foes [...] 880 [...] Messiah his triumphal Chariot turnd: [...] To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood [...] Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts, [...] With Jubilie advanc'd; and as they went, [...] Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright, [...] Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King, [...] Son, Heire, and Lord, to him Dominion giv'n, [...] Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode [...] Triumphant through mid Heav'n, into the Courts [...] And Temple of his mightie Father Thron'd [...] 890 [...] On high; who into Glorie him receav'd, [...] Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss. [...] Thus measuring things in Heav'n by things on Earth [...] At thy request, and that thou maist beware [...] By what is past, to thee I have reveal'd [...] What might have else to human Race bin hid; [...] The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav'n [...] Among th' Angelic Powers, and the deep fall [...] Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld [...] With Satan, hee who envies now thy state, [...] 900 [...] Who now is plotting how he may seduce [...] Thee also from obedience, that with him [...] Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake [...] His punishment, Eternal miserie; [...] Which would be all his solace and revenge, [...] As a despite don against the most High, [...] Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe. [...] But list'n not to his Temptations, warne [...] Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard [...] By terrible Example the reward [...] 910 [...] Of disobedience; firm they might have stood, [...] Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.|$|E

Thus repuls'd, our final hope [...] Is flat despair: we must exasperate [...] Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage, [...] And that must end us, that must be our cure, [...] To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose, [...] Though full of pain, this intellectual being, [...] Those thoughts that wander through Eternity, [...] To perish rather, swallowd up and lost [...] In the wide womb of uncreated night, [...] 150 [...] Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows, [...] Let this be good, whether our angry Foe [...] Can give it, or will ever? how he can [...] Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.

[...] Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed, [...] 160 [...] Reserv'd and destin'd to Eternal woe; [...] Whatever doing, what can we suffer more, [...] What can we suffer worse? is this then worst, [...] Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms? [...] What when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook [...] With Heav'ns afflicting Thunder, and besought [...] The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem'd [...] A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay [...] Chain'd on the burning Lake? that sure was worse. [...] What if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires [...] 170 [...] Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage [...] And plunge us in the Flames? or from above [...] Should intermitted vengeance Arme again [...] His red right hand to plague us? what if all [...] Her stores were op'n'd, and this Firmament [...] Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire, [...] Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall [...] One day upon our heads; while we perhaps [...] Designing or exhorting glorious Warr, [...] Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl'd [...] 180 [...] Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey [...] Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk [...] Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains; [...] There to converse with everlasting groans, [...] Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, [...] Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse. [...] Warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike [...] My voice disswades; for what can force or guile [...] With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye [...] Views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth [...] 190 [...] All these our motions vain, sees and derides; [...] Not more Almighty to resist our might [...] Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. [...] Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav'n [...] Thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here [...] Chains and these Torments? better these then worse [...] By my advice; since fate inevitable [...] Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree, [...] The Victors will. To suffer, as to doe, [...] Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust [...] 200 [...] That so ordains: this was at first resolv'd, [...] If we were wise, against so great a foe [...] Contending, and so doubtful what might fall. [...] I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold [...] And vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear [...] What yet they know must follow, to endure [...] Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, [...] The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now [...] Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, [...] Our Supream Foe in time may much remit [...] 210 [...] His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd [...] Not mind us not offending, satisfi'd [...] With what is punish't; whence these raging fires [...] Will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames. [...] Our purer essence then will overcome [...] Thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel, [...] Or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd [...] In temper and in nature, will receive [...] Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain; [...] This horror will grow milde, this darkness light, [...] 220 [...] Besides what hope the never-ending flight [...] Of future days may bring, what chance, what change [...] Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers [...] For happy though but ill, for ill not worst, [...] If we procure not to our selves more woe. [...] Thus Belial with words cloath'd in reasons garb [...] Counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath, [...] Not peace: and after him thus Mammon spake. [...] Either to disinthrone the King of Heav'n [...] We warr, if warr be best, or to regain [...] 230 [...] Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then [...] May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild [...] To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife: [...] The former vain to hope argues as vain [...] The latter: for what place can be for us [...] Within Heav'ns bound, unless Heav'ns Lord supream [...] We overpower? Suppose he should relent [...] And publish Grace to all, on promise made [...] Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we [...] Stand in his presence humble, and receive [...] 240 [...] Strict Laws impos'd, to celebrate his Throne [...] With warbl'd Hymns, and to his Godhead sing [...] Forc't Halleluiah's; while he Lordly sits [...] Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes [...] Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers, [...] Our servile offerings. This must be our task [...] In Heav'n, this our delight; how wearisom [...] Eternity so spent in worship paid [...] To whom we hate. Let us not then pursue [...] By force impossible, by leave obtain'd [...] 250 [...] Unacceptable, though in Heav'n, our state [...] Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek [...] Our own good from our selves, and from our own [...] Live to our selves, though in this vast recess, [...] Free, and to none accountable, preferring [...] Hard liberty before the easie yoke [...] Of servile Pomp. Our greatness will appear [...] Then most conspicuous, when great things of small, [...] Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse [...] We can create, and in what place so e're [...] 260 [...] Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain [...] Through labour and endurance. This deep world [...] Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst [...] Thick clouds and dark doth Heav'ns all-ruling Sire [...] Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur'd, [...] And with the Majesty of darkness round [...] Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar [...] Must'ring thir rage, and Heav'n resembles Hell? [...] As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light [...] Imitate when we please? This Desart soile [...] 270 [...] Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold; [...] Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise [...] Magnificence; and what can Heav'n shew more? [...] Our torments also may in length of time [...] Become our Elements, these piercing Fires [...] As soft as now severe, our temper chang'd [...] Into their temper; which must needs remove [...] The sensible of pain. All things invite [...] To peaceful Counsels, and the settl'd State [...] Of order, how in safety best we may [...] 280 [...] Compose our present evils, with regard [...] Of what we are and where, dismissing quite [...] All thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise. [...] He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld [...] Th' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain [...] The sound of blustring winds, which all night long [...] Had rous'd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull [...] Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance [...] Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay [...] After the Tempest: Such applause was heard [...] 290 [...] As Mammon ended, and his Sentence pleas'd, [...] Advising peace: for such another Field [...] They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear [...] Of Thunder and the Sword of Michael [...] Wrought still within them; and no less desire [...] To found this nether Empire, which might rise [...] By pollicy, and long process of time, [...] In emulation opposite to Heav'n. [...] Which when Beelzebub perceiv'd, then whom, [...] Satan except, none higher sat, with grave [...] 300 [...] Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd [...] A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven [...] Deliberation sat and publick care; [...] And Princely counsel in his face yet shon, [...] Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood [...] With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear [...] The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look [...] Drew audience and attention still as Night [...] Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake. [...] Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav'n, [...] 310 [...] Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now [...] Must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd [...] Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote [...] Inclines, here to continue, and build up here [...] A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream, [...] And know not that the King of Heav'n hath doom'd [...] This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat [...] Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt [...] From Heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new League [...] Banded against his Throne, but to remaine [...] 320 [...] In strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd, [...] Under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd [...] His captive multitude: For he, be sure, [...] In highth or depth, still first and last will Reign [...] Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part [...] By our revolt, but over Hell extend [...] His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule [...] Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav'n. [...] What sit we then projecting Peace and Warr? [...] Warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss [...] 330 [...] Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none [...] Voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n [...] To us enslav'd, but custody severe, [...] And stripes, and arbitrary punishment [...] Inflicted? and what peace can we return, [...] But to our power hostility and hate, [...] Untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow, [...] Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour least [...] May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce [...] In doing what we most in suffering feel? [...] 340 [...] Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need [...] With dangerous expedition to invade [...] Heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege, [...] Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find [...] Some easier enterprize? There is a place [...] (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav'n [...] Err not) another World, the happy seat [...] Of som new Race call'd Man, about this time [...] To be created like to us, though less [...] In power and excellence, but favour'd more [...] 350 [...] Of him who rules above; so was his will [...] Pronounc'd among the Gods, and by an Oath, [...] That shook Heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd. [...] Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn [...] What creatures there inhabit, of what mould, [...] Or substance, how endu'd, and what thir Power, [...] And where thir weakness, how attempted best, [...] By force or suttlety: Though Heav'n be shut, [...] And Heav'ns high Arbitrator sit secure [...] In his own strength, this place may lye expos'd [...] 360 [...] The utmost border of his Kingdom, left [...] To their defence who hold it: here perhaps [...] Som advantagious act may be achiev'd [...] By sudden onset, either with Hell fire [...] To waste his whole Creation, or possess [...] All as our own, and drive as we were driven, [...] The punie habitants, or if not drive, [...] Seduce them to our Party, that thir God [...] May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand [...] Abolish his own works. This would surpass [...] 370 [...] Common revenge, and interrupt his joy [...] In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise [...] In his disturbance; when his darling Sons [...] Hurl'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse [...] Thir frail Originals, and faded bliss, [...] Faded so soon. Advise if this be worth [...] Attempting, or to sit in darkness here [...] Hatching vain Empires. Thus Beelzebub [...] Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis'd [...] By Satan, and in part propos'd: for whence, [...] 380 [...] But from the Author of all ill could Spring [...] So deep a malice, to confound the race [...] Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell [...] To mingle and involve, done all to spite [...] The great Creatour? But thir spite still serves [...] His glory to augment. The bold design [...] Pleas'd highly those infernal States, and joy [...] Sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent [...] They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews. [...] Well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate, [...] 390 [...] Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are, [...] Great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep [...] Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate, [...] Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view [...] Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms [...] And opportune excursion we may chance [...] Re-enter Heav'n; or else in some milde Zone [...] Dwell not unvisited of Heav'ns fair Light [...] Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam [...] Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air, [...] 400 [...] To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires [...] Shall breath her balme. But first whom shall we send [...] In search of this new world, whom shall we find [...] Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet [...] The dark unbottom'd infinite Abyss [...] And through the palpable obscure find out [...] His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight [...] Upborn with indefatigable wings [...] Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive [...] The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then [...] 410 [...] Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe [...] Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick [...] Of Angels watching round? Here he had need [...] All circumspection, and we now no less [...] Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send, [...] The weight of all and our last hope relies. [...] This said, he sat; and expectation held [...] His look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd [...] To second, or oppose, or undertake [...] The perilous attempt: but all sat mute, [...] 420 [...] Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each [...] In others count'nance red his own dismay [...] Astonisht: none among the choice and prime [...] Of those Heav'n-warring Champions could be found [...] So hardie as to proffer or accept [...] Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last [...] Satan, whom now transcendent glory rais'd [...] Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride [...] Conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake. [...] O Progeny of Heav'n, Empyreal Thrones, [...] 430 [...] With reason hath deep silence and demurr [...] Seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way [...] And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light; [...] Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire, [...] Outrageous to devour, immures us round [...] Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant [...] Barr'd over us prohibit all egress. [...] These past, if any pass, the void profound [...] Of unessential Night receives him next [...] Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being [...] 440 [...] Threatens him, plung'd in that abortive gulf. [...] If thence he scape into what ever world, [...] Or unknown Region, what remains him less [...] Then unknown dangers and as hard escape. [...] But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers, [...] And this Imperial Sov'ranty, adorn'd [...] With splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd [...] And judg'd of public moment, in the shape [...] Of difficulty or danger could deterre [...] Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume [...] 450 [...] These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign, [...] Refusing to accept as great a share [...] Of hazard as of honour, due alike [...] To him who Reigns, and so much to him due [...] Of hazard more, as he above the rest [...] High honourd sits? Go <b>therfore</b> mighty powers, [...] Terror of Heav'n, though fall'n; intend at home, [...] While here shall be our home, what best may ease [...] The present misery, and render Hell [...] More tollerable; if there be cure or charm [...] 460 [...] To respite or deceive, or slack the pain [...] Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch [...] Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad [...] Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek [...] Deliverance for us all: this enterprize [...] None shall partake with me. Thus saying rose [...] The Monarch, and prevented all reply, [...] Prudent, least from his resolution rais'd [...] Others among the chief might offer now [...] (Certain to be refus'd) what erst they feard; [...] 470 [...] And so refus'd might in opinion stand [...] His rivals, winning cheap the high repute [...] Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they [...] Dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice [...] Forbidding; and at once with him they rose; [...] Thir rising all at once was as the sound [...] Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend [...] With awful reverence prone; and as a God [...] Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav'n: [...] Nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd, [...] 480 [...] That for the general safety he despis'd [...] His own: for neither do the Spirits damn'd [...] Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast [...] Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, [...] Or close ambition varnisht o're with zeal. [...] Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark [...] Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief: [...] As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds [...] Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o'respread [...] Heav'ns chearful face, the lowring Element [...] 490 [...] Scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip Snow, or showre; [...] If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet [...] Extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive, [...] The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds [...] Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. [...] O shame to men! Devil with Devil damn'd [...] Firm concord holds, men onely disagree [...] Of Creatures rational, though under hope [...] Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace, [...] Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife [...] 500 [...] Among themselves, and levie cruel warres, [...] Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy: [...] As if (which might induce us to accord) [...] Man had not hellish foes anow besides, [...] That {{day and night for}} his destruction waite. [...] The Stygian Councel thus dissolv'd; and forth [...] In order came the grand infernal Peers, [...] Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd [...] Alone th' Antagonist of Heav'n, nor less [...] Then Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream, [...] 510 [...] And God-like imitated State; him round [...] A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos'd [...] With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms. [...] Then of thir Session ended they bid cry [...] With Trumpets regal sound the great result: [...] Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim [...] Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie [...] By Haralds voice explain'd: the hollow Abyss [...] Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell [...] With deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim. [...] 520 [...] Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd [...] By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers [...] Disband, and wandring, each his several way [...] Pursues, as inclination or sad choice [...] Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find [...] Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain [...] The irksome hours, till his great Chief return. [...] Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime [...] Upon the wing, or in swift race contend, [...] As at th' Olympian Games or Pythian fields; [...] 530 [...] Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal [...] With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form. [...] As when to warn proud Cities warr appears [...] Wag'd in the troubl'd Skie, and Armies rush [...] To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van [...] Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears [...] Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms [...] From either end of Heav'n the welkin burns. [...] Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell [...] Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air [...] 540 [...] In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. [...] As when Alcides from Oealia Crown'd [...] With conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore [...] Through pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines, [...] And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw [...] Into th' Euboic Sea. Others more milde, [...] Retreated in a silent valley, sing [...] With notes Angelical to many a Harp [...] Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall [...] By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate [...] 550 [...] Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance. [...] Thir song was partial, but the harmony [...] (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) [...] Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment [...] The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet [...] (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,) [...] Others apart sat on a Hill retir'd, [...] In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high [...] Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate, [...] Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute, [...] 560 [...] And found no end, in wandring mazes lost. [...] Of good and evil much they argu'd then, [...] Of happiness and final misery, [...] Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame, [...] Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie: [...] Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm [...] Pain for a while or anguish, and excite [...] Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest [...] With stubborn patience as with triple steel. [...] Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands, [...] 570 [...] On bold adventure to discover wide [...] That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps [...] Might yeild them easier habitation, bend [...] Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks [...] Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge [...] Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams; [...] Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate, [...] Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep; [...] Cocytus, nam'd of lamentation loud [...] Heard on the ruful stream; fierce Phlegeton [...] 580 [...] Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. [...] Farr off from these a slow and silent stream, [...] Lethe the River of Oblivion roules [...] Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks, [...] Forthwith his former state and being forgets, [...] Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. [...] Beyond this flood a frozen Continent [...] Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms [...] Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land [...] Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems [...] 590 [...] Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, [...] A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog [...] Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old, [...] Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air [...] Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of Fire. [...] Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail'd, [...] At certain revolutions all the damn'd [...] Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change [...] Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, [...] From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice [...] 600 [...] Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine [...] Immovable, infixt, and frozen round, [...] Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. [...] They ferry over this Lethean Sound [...] Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, [...] And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach [...] The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose [...] In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, [...] All in one moment, and so neer the brink; [...] But fate withstands, and to oppose th' attempt [...] 610 [...] Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards [...] The Ford, and of it self the water flies [...] All taste of living wight, as once it fled [...] The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on [...] In confus'd march forlorn, th' adventrous Bands [...] With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast [...] View'd first thir lamentable lot, and found [...] No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile [...] They pass'd, and many a Region dolorous, [...] O're many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe, [...] 620 [...] Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death, [...] A Universe of death, which God by curse [...] Created evil, for evil only good, [...] Where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds, [...] Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, [...] Abominable, inutterable, and worse [...] Then Fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd, [...] Gorgons and Hydra's, and Chimera's dire. [...] Mean while the Adversary of God and Man, [...] Satan with thoughts inflam'd of highest design, [...] 630 [...] Puts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell [...] Explores his solitary flight; som times [...] He scours the right hand coast, som times the left, [...] Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares [...] Up to the fiery concave touring high. [...] As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri'd [...] Hangs in the Clouds, by Aequinoctial Winds [...] Close sailing from Bengala, or the Iles [...] Of Ternate and Tidore, whence Merchants bring [...] Thir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood [...] 640 [...] Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape [...] Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole. So seem'd [...] Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer [...] Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof, [...] And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass [...] Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock, [...] Impenitrable, impal'd with circling fire, [...] Yet unconsum'd. Before the Gates there sat [...] On either side a formidable shape; [...] The one seem'd Woman to the waste, and fair, [...] 650 [...] But ended foul in many a scaly fould [...] Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm'd [...] With mortal sting: about her middle round [...] A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark'd [...] With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung [...] A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep, [...] If aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb, [...] And kennel there, yet there still bark'd and howl'd [...] Within unseen. Farr less abhorrd then these [...] Vex'd Scylla bathing in the Sea that parts [...] 660 [...] Calabria from the hoarce Trinacrian shore: [...] Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call'd [...] In secret, riding through the Air she comes [...] Lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance [...] With Lapland Witches, while the labouring Moon [...] Eclipses at thir charms. The other shape, [...] If shape it might be call'd that shape had none [...] Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, [...] Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd, [...] For each seem'd either; black it stood as Night, [...] 670 [...] Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell, [...] And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem'd his head [...] The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on. [...] Satan was now at hand, and from his seat [...] The Monster moving onward came as fast, [...] With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode. [...] Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admir'd, [...] Admir'd, not fear'd; God and his Son except, [...] Created thing naught vallu'd he nor shun'd; [...] And with disdainful look thus first began. [...] 680 [...] Whence and what art thou, execrable shape, [...] That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance [...] Thy miscreated Front athwart my way [...] To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass, [...] That be assur'd, without leave askt of thee: [...] Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, [...] Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav'n. [...] To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply'd, [...] Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee, [...] Who first broke peace in Heav'n and Faith, till then [...] 690 [...] Unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious Arms [...] Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Sons [...] Conjur'd against the highest, for which both Thou [...] And they outcast from God, are here condemn'd [...] To waste Eternal daies in woe and pain? [...] And reck'n'st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav'n, [...] Hell-doomd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn, [...] Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more, [...] Thy King and Lord? Back to thy punishment, [...] False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, [...] 700 [...] Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue [...] Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart [...] Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before. [...] So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape, [...] So speaking and so threatning, grew ten fold [...] More dreadful and deform: on th' other side [...] Incenc't with indignation Satan stood [...] Unterrifi'd, and like a Comet burn'd, [...] That fires the length of Ophiucus huge [...] In th' Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair [...] 710 [...] Shakes Pestilence and Warr. Each at the Head [...] Level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands [...] No second stroke intend, and such a frown [...] Each cast at th' other, as when two black Clouds [...] With Heav'ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on [...] Over the Caspian, then stand front to front [...] Hov'ring a space, till Winds the signal blow [...] To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air: [...] So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell [...] Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood; [...] 720 [...] For never but once more was either like [...] To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds [...] Had been achiev'd, whereof all Hell had rung, [...] Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat [...] Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key, [...] Ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between. [...] O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd, [...] Against thy only Son? What fury O Son, [...] Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart [...] Against thy Fathers head? and know'st for whom; [...] 730 [...] For him who sits above and laughs the while [...] At thee ordain'd his drudge, to execute [...] What e're his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids, [...] His wrath which one day will destroy ye both. [...] She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest [...] Forbore, then these to her Satan return'd: [...] So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange [...] Thou interposest, that my sudden hand [...] Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds [...] What it intends; till first I know of thee, [...] 740 [...] What thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and why [...] In this infernal Vaile first met thou call'st [...] Me Father, and that Fantasm call'st my Son? [...] I know thee not, nor ever saw till now [...] Sight more detestable then him and thee. [...] T' whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply'd; [...] Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem [...] Now in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair [...] In Heav'n, when at th' Assembly, and in sight [...] Of all the Seraphim with thee combin'd [...] 750 [...] In bold conspiracy against Heav'ns King, [...] All on a sudden miserable pain [...] Surpris'd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm [...] In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast [...] Threw forth, till on the left side op'ning wide, [...] Likest to thee in shape and count'nance bright, [...] Then shining heav'nly fair, a Goddess arm'd [...] Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis'd [...] All th' Host of Heav'n; back they recoild affraid [...] At first, and call'd me Sin, and for a Sign [...] 760 [...] Portentous held me; but familiar grown, [...] I pleas'd, and with attractive graces won [...] The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft [...] Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing [...] Becam'st enamour'd, and such joy thou took'st [...] With me in secret, that my womb conceiv'd [...] A growing burden. Mean while Warr arose, [...] And fields were fought in Heav'n; wherein remaind [...] (For what could else) to our Almighty Foe [...] Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout [...] 770 [...] Through all the Empyrean: down they fell [...] Driv'n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down [...] Into this Deep, and in the general fall [...] I also; at which time this powerful Key [...] Into my hand was giv'n, with charge to keep [...] These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass [...] Without my op'ning. Pensive here I sat [...] Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb [...] Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown [...] Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. [...] 780 [...] At last this odious offspring whom thou seest [...] Thine own begotten, breaking violent way [...] Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain [...] Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew [...] Transform'd: but he my inbred enemie [...] Forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal Dart [...] Made to destroy: I fled, and cry'd out Death; [...] Hell trembl'd at the hideous Name, and sigh'd [...] From all her Caves, and back resounded Death. [...] I fled, but he pursu'd (though more, it seems, [...] 790 [...] Inflam'd with lust then rage) and swifter far, [...] Me overtook his mother all dismaid, [...] And in embraces forcible and foule [...] Ingendring with me, of that rape begot [...] These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry [...] Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv'd [...] And hourly born, with sorrow infinite [...] To me, for when they list into the womb [...] That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw [...] My Bowels, their repast; then bursting forth [...] 800 [...] Afresh with conscious terrours vex me round, [...] That rest or intermission none I find. [...] Before mine eyes in opposition sits [...] Grim Death my Son and foe, who sets them on, [...] And me his Parent would full soon devour [...] For want of other prey, but that he knows [...] His end with mine involvd; and knows that I [...] Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane, [...] When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc'd. [...] But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun [...] 810 [...] His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope [...] To be invulnerable in those bright Arms, [...] Though temper'd heav'nly, for that mortal dint, [...] Save he who reigns above, none can resist. [...] She finish'd, and the suttle Fiend his lore [...] Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth. [...] Dear Daughter, since thou claim'st me for thy Sire, [...] And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge [...] Of dalliance had with thee in Heav'n, and joys [...] Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change [...] 820 [...] Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know [...] I come no enemie, but to set free [...] From out this dark and dismal house of pain, [...] Both him and thee, and all the heav'nly Host [...] Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm'd [...] Fell with us from on high: from them I go [...] This uncouth errand sole, and one for all [...] My self expose, with lonely steps to tread [...] Th' unfounded deep, & through the void immense [...] To search with wandring quest a place foretold [...] 830 [...] Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now [...] Created vast and round, a place of bliss [...] In the Pourlieues of Heav'n, and therein plac't [...] A race of upstart Creatures, to supply [...] Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov'd, [...] Least Heav'n surcharg'd with potent multitude [...] Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught [...] Then this more secret now design'd, I haste [...] To know, and this once known, shall soon return, [...] And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death [...] 840 [...] Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen [...] Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm'd [...] With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill'd [...] Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey. [...] He ceas'd, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death [...] Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear [...] His famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe [...] Destin'd to that good hour: no less rejoyc'd [...] His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire. [...] The key of this infernal Pit by due, [...] 850 [...] And by command of Heav'ns all-powerful King [...] I keep, by him forbidden to unlock [...] These Adamantine Gates; against all force [...] Death ready stands to interpose his dart, [...] Fearless to be o'rematcht by living might. [...] But what ow I to his commands above [...] Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down [...] Into this gloom of Tartarus profound, [...] To sit in hateful Office here confin'd, [...] Inhabitant of Heav'n, and heav'nlie-born, [...] 860 [...] Here in perpetual agonie and pain, [...] With terrors and with clamors compasst round [...] Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed: [...] Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou [...] My being gav'st me; whom should I obey [...] But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon [...] To that new world of light and bliss, among [...] The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign [...] At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems [...] Thy daughter and thy darling, without end. [...] 870 [...] Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key, [...] Sad instrument of all our woe, she took; [...] And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train, [...] Forthwith the huge Portcullis high up drew, [...] Which but her self not all the Stygian powers [...] Could once have mov'd; then in the key-hole turns [...] Th' intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar [...] Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease [...] Unfast'ns: on a sudden op'n flie [...] With impetuous recoile and jarring sound [...] 880 [...] Th' infernal dores, and on thir hinges great [...] Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook [...] Of Erebus. She op'nd, but to shut [...] Excel'd her power; the Gates wide op'n stood, [...] That with extended wings a Bannerd Host [...] Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through [...] With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array; [...] So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth [...] Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame. [...] Before thir eyes in sudden view appear [...] 890 [...] The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark [...] Illimitable Ocean without bound, [...] Without dimension, where length, breadth, and highth, [...] And time and place are lost; where eldest Night [...] And Chaos, Ancestors of Nature, hold [...] Eternal Anarchie, amidst the noise [...] Of endless warrs and by confusion stand. [...] For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce [...] Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring [...] Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag [...] 900 [...] Of each his faction, in thir several Clanns, [...] Light-arm'd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow, [...] Swarm populous, unnumber'd as the Sands [...] Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil, [...] Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise [...] Thir lighter wings. To whom these most adhere, [...] Hee rules a moment; Chaos Umpire sits, [...] And by decision more imbroiles the fray [...] By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter [...] Chance governs all. Into this wilde Abyss, [...] 910 [...] The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave, [...] Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire, [...] But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt [...] Confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight, [...] Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain [...] His dark materials to create more Worlds, [...] Into this wilde Abyss the warie fiend [...] Stood on the brink of Hell and look'd a while, [...] Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith [...] He had to cross. Nor was his eare less peal'd [...] 920 [...] With noises loud and ruinous (to compare [...] Great things with small) then when Bellona storms, [...] With all her battering Engines bent to rase [...] Som Capital City, or less then if this frame [...] Of Heav'n were falling, and these Elements [...] In mutinie had from her Axle torn [...] The stedfast Earth. At last his Sail-broad Vannes [...] He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak [...] Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League [...] As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides [...] 930 [...] Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets [...] A vast vacuitie: all unawares [...] Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops [...] Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour [...] Down had been falling, had not by ill chance [...] The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud [...] Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him [...] As many miles aloft: that furie stay'd, [...] Quencht in a Boggie Syrtis, neither Sea, [...] Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares, [...] 940 [...] Treading the crude consistence, half on foot, [...] Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile. [...] As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness [...] With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale, [...] Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stelth [...] Had from his wakeful custody purloind [...] The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend [...] Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, [...] With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way, [...] And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: [...] 950 [...] At length a universal hubbub wilde [...] Of stunning sounds and voices all confus'd [...] Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare [...] With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes, [...] Undaunted to meet there what ever power [...] Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss [...] Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask [...] Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes [...] Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne [...] Of Chaos, and his dark Pavilion spread [...] 960 [...] Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron'd [...] Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things, [...] The consort of his Reign; and by them stood [...] Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name [...] Of Demogorgon; Rumor next and Chance, [...] And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild, [...] And Discord with a thousand various mouths. [...] T' whom Satan turning boldly, thus. Ye Powers [...] And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss, [...] Chaos and Ancient Night, I come no Spie, [...] 970 [...] With purpose to explore or to disturb [...] The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint [...] Wandring this darksome desart, as my way [...] Lies through your spacious Empire up to light, [...] Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek [...] What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds [...] Confine with Heav'n; or if som other place [...] From your Dominion won, th' Ethereal King [...] Possesses lately, thither to arrive [...] I travel this profound, direct my course; [...] 980 [...] Directed, no mean recompence it brings [...] To your behoof, if I that Region lost, [...] All usurpation thence expell'd, reduce [...] To her original darkness and your sway [...] (Which is my present journey) and once more [...] Erect the Standerd there of Ancient Night; [...] Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge. [...] Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old [...] With faultring speech and visage incompos'd [...] Answer'd. I know thee, stranger, who thou art, [...] 990 [...] That mighty leading Angel, who of late [...] Made head against Heav'ns King, though overthrown.

5000|$|He is {{generally}} {{supposed to have}} been the Vache referred to in Chaucer's poem Truth which says [...] " [...] <b>Therfore,</b> thou Vache, leve thine olde wrechednesse; Unto the world leve now to be thral.". It supposedly refers to a period between 1386 and 1389 when Vache was out of favour at court and had temporarily lost his positions there. His father was a close friend of Chaucer's and Chaucer knew Sir Philip well. A country gentleman with a reputation for lavish hospitality, he may also have been the model for the Franklin in the General Prologue to [...] "The Canterbury Tales". However, the reference to Vache in Chaucer's poem may on good grounds also be a pun on his own name. The phrase Vache, leve! in the first line of the Envoy corresponds to medieval French Vache, reïs!, 'cow, leave!'. The French phase reïs, Vache!, (REISVACHE), when reversed, becomes CHAVSIER, the French form of the poet's name (this is a so-called palindrome). In the First Book of Kings in the Old Testament, the cows on their way to Beth Shemesh are likened to holy men, or monks {{on their way to the}} Heavenly Jerusalem. Chaucer may have regarded this interpretation of his name as a summons to give up his sinful life and to join the monks of Westminster Abbey.|$|E
