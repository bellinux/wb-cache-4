5|$|As {{a result}} of the poor {{economic}} conditions, Eurostar received state aid in May 2009 to cancel out some of the accumulated debt from the High Speed 1 construction programme. Later that year, during snowy conditions in the run-up <b>to</b> <b>Christmas,</b> thousands of passengers were left stranded as several trains broke down and many more were cancelled. In an independent review commissioned by Eurostar, the company came in for serious criticism about its handling of the incident and lack of plans for such a scenario.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1990s, the town {{experienced}} severe flooding problems from the Severn and Rea Brook. In {{the autumn of}} 2000 large swathes of the town were underwater, notably Frankwell, which flooded three times in six weeks. The Frankwell flood defences were completed in 2003, along with the new offices of the borough council. More recently, such as in 2005 and 2007, flooding has been less severe, and the defences have generally held back floodwaters from the town centre areas. However, the town car parks are often left to be flooded in the winter, which reduces trade in the town, most evidenced in the run up <b>to</b> <b>Christmas</b> in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Johann Kuhnau, Bach's {{predecessor}} as Thomaskantor, {{composed a}} Latin Magnificat in two versions: one version {{with only the}} Latin text of the Magnificat for Marian feasts such as Visitation, and another version expanded with four German and Latin laudes relating <b>to</b> <b>Christmas.</b> When Bach presented his Latin Magnificat in 1723 (E-flat major version, BWV243a) it had the same expandable format: without laudes for Visitation, and with four laudes, on the same text as Kuhnau's, for Christmas. Another composition presented by Bach at that year's feast of the Visitation was Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben, BWV147, an expanded version of an Advent cantata composed before his Leipzig period (BWV147a).|$|E
5|$|Katie is also {{patron of}} Fair Trees, the {{organisation}} {{that is trying}} to stop exploitation of cone pickers in Ambrolauri, Georgia, by the European Christmas tree industry. The local people in this region of Georgia are paid a pittance to risk their lives climbing 30m high fir trees to collect the cones from which the seeds are extracted and sent <b>to</b> <b>Christmas</b> tree nurseries in Europe. Until Fair Trees came along these cone pickers were given no safety equipment or training, no health insurance and very little pay; every year people are injured and even killed doing this work. Fair Trees grow and sell the only fair trade Christmas trees in the world (certified by the WFTO).|$|E

50|$|American {{advertisers}} {{began using}} Christmas in July themes in print for summertime sales {{as early as}} 1950. In the United States, it is more often used as a marketing tool than an actual holiday. Television stations may choose <b>to</b> re-run <b>Christmas</b> specials, and many stores have Christmas in July sales. Some individuals choose <b>to</b> celebrate <b>Christmas</b> in July themselves, typically as an intentionally transparent excuse to have a party.

5|$|His initial posting to the Pacific Theater {{was delayed}} by a month, {{during which he}} {{completed}} further training on the Cessna AT-17 Bobcat. By virtue of this additional training, and because Roddenberry's height made it unlikely {{that he would be}} suitable for a combat fighter pilot, he was assigned to bombers. He received orders to report to Bellows Field, Oahu, to join the 394th Bomb Squadron, 5th Bombardment Group, of the Thirteenth Air Force. The squadron flew the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, which had previously been used by the 19th Bomb Group, and were en route to a maintenance overhaul when they had to flee due to the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. Roddenberry was assigned as Captain William Ripley's co-pilot for the flight that the squadron took <b>to</b> <b>Christmas</b> Island, and the following day to Canton Island. An additional flight on November 17 took the squadron to Nadi, Fiji, where they were expected to go on to the New Hebrides. Instead they were ordered to remain in Nadi to fly reconnaissance missions.|$|E
5|$|In {{his role}} as Controller of Atomic Energy, Morgan was present for Operation Hurricane, the first British atomic weapons tests at the Montebello Islands in October 1952. His {{position}} was gradually reduced to a figurehead, with his authority largely supplanted by the Atomic Energy Board, which was chaired by Lord Cherwell, and was abolished in 1954 {{with the creation of}} the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. Morgan then became Controller of Nuclear Weapons. Nonetheless, he was still an important figure in the push for higher-yield weapons. He pressed for the testing of the Green Bamboo boosted fission weapon during Operation Mosaic. This resulted in Mosaic becoming a two-test series, although Green Bamboo could not be made available in time. A Green Bamboo assembly was subsequently taken <b>to</b> <b>Christmas</b> Island for Operation Grapple, but was deleted from the test series to save money. Morgan was also instrumental in putting the case {{for the development of the}} H-bomb on operational grounds.|$|E

5|$|Allardyce {{was offered}} the Manchester City job, but the offer was {{withdrawn}} after Thaksin Shinawatra's purchase offer of the club was accepted. On 15 May 2007, Newcastle United announced that Allardyce had signed a three-year contract to succeed Glenn Roeder as manager. Ironically Newcastle then also {{had a change of}} owners, as Mike Ashley completed his takeover of the club. The sales of Scott Parker and Kieron Dyer raised ¬£13million, allowing Allardyce to sign Australia international striker Mark Viduka (free transfer), utility man Alan Smith (¬£6million), midfielder Geremi Njitap, controversial midfielder Joey Barton (¬£5.5million), left-back Jos√© Enrique (¬£6.3million), right-back Habib Beye (¬£2million), and defender Abdoulaye Faye. Newcastle enjoyed a good start to the season, beating Allardyce's former club Bolton 3‚Äì1 on the opening day in a run of five wins and two draws from the opening nine league games. However they then had a series of disappointing results in the run-up <b>to</b> <b>Christmas,</b> and after gaining only one point from a possible six from bottom-of-the-table Wigan and Derby. Allardyce parted company with Newcastle United on 9 January 2008. He had gone into the meeting with chairman Chris Mort expecting to be told Newcastle had signed a new player, not expecting that Ashley and Mort had decided to instead sign Kevin Keegan to return as manager.|$|E
