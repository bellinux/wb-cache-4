Based on the measured daily and seasonal <b>temperature</b> data, correlations between air <b>temperature</b> and surface <b>temperature,</b> as well as surface <b>temperature</b> and slab <b>temperature</b> difference, were developed. A finite element analysis was performed to simulate the <b>temperature</b> variation in a PCC pavement, and the analysis results were compared to the field measurement. A local calibration of the enhanced integrated climatic model (EICM) was conducted by comparing the field-measurements with the EICM-predicted <b>temperature</b> gradients.
