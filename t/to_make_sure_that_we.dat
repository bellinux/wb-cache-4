500|$|In late 2006, St. John and Howarth {{simultaneously}} began {{contract negotiations}} with their respective shows, which caused rumors that St. John was departing from OLTL, leaving room for Howarth, {{who was with}} the soap opera As the World Turns at the time, to return as Todd. TV Guide sought to clear up the matter and questioned executive producer Frank Valentini, who stated that although {{he was not able}} to comment on contracts, the producers were [...] "doing our best <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do right by the audience". [...] In 2007, TV Guide received official confirmation Howarth would not be returning to the series. [...] The magazine conducted a poll on its website, TV Guide.com, and found that 82 percent of the show's viewers wanted to see Howarth return. [...] Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide.com disagreed with the results, stating, [...] "Perhaps I'm in the minority, but I absolutely adore Trevor St. John", whose portrayal of Todd he found [...] "very cocky, arrogant and humorous in a sexy way".|$|E
500|$|In January 2007, Brunner {{proposed}} {{a plan that}} would allow counties to recruit poll workers by mail, who would then undertake two paid training days, and work a paid eight-hour shift at the polls on Election Day. Brunner explained the plan in an interview: [...] "In terms of Ohio and what happened in the 2004 presidential election, there has been a crisis in confidence in our election system in Ohio, both nationally and in our state. One of the quickest ways to repair that is <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have adequate numbers of poll workers. ... We suggested this as one tool that the boards of elections would have available to them for recruiting poll workers. We would be looking to do this similar to how we recruit jurors, only jurors are recruited for two weeks of service whereas we'd only be asking for three days. It would also allow us to offer split shifts to poll workers. In Ohio the polling places are open for thirteen hours, so essentially a poll worker works at least fourteen hours; with the average age of our poll workers at 72, that's a tough day for anyone, no matter what their age is. ... It's an option, and we can even include a trigger, so that a county has to be deficient by a certain percentage of poll workers to even be able to use this." [...] In the initial proposal it was not yet decided what wages would be paid, and whether refusing recruitment would result in penalties. The proposal will be decided by the Ohio General Assembly.|$|E

500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't ask him about the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day." ...|$|E

Our focus this time around – rather than create a whole series of chase characters, we wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had a wider variety of characters," [...] he said. [...] "What we decided to do instead was really put our horsepower into creating different characters as opposed to variants. We think our fans appreciate having a character like Star-Lord or Rocket Raccoon as opposed to another version of Mickey Mouse." [...] The game has been designed to be less violent, in order to appeal to a wider audience. Despite this, a Crystal variation of Sorcerer's Apprentice Mickey Mouse will be released.|$|E

2500|$|After the race, Michael Schumacher accused Coulthard of [...] "unsporting behaviour" [...] in {{the battle}} for the race lead. The {{accusation}} arose from Coulthard's minor collision with the Ferrari driver. Michael Schumacher believed that Coulthard was driving dangerously: [...] "He [...] ran in a way that he thought it [...] could happen, and he didn't try to avoid that, that's pretty simple. As he is not fighting for the championship.....I just want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> don't see teammates helping the drivers fighting for the championship in the way which is not appropriate." [...] Coulthard denied any wrongdoing: [...] "I could have easily pushed him off the circuit. But I didn't and I won't in the future because it is not sporting and it is not the way I do things." [...] There was similar ill-feeling between Trulli and Button after their collision on lap two. Trulli called the Williams driver an [...] "idiot" [...] and accused him of [...] "driving like a crazy". Button defended his actions and suggested that Trulli had moved slightly towards him although he believed he took the right line. He also believed Trulli moved towards him under braking.|$|E
