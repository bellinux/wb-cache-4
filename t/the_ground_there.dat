5|$|The flycatchers {{are small}} birds that fly {{out from a}} perch to catch insects in the air or from <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>There</b> are about 120 species worldwide, 11 {{of which have been}} {{recorded}} in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Round two {{started with}} two fighters {{throwing}} strikes with St-Pierre landing a punch drawing blood from Penn's nose. St-Pierre then clinched up and tripped Penn to <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>There</b> Penn attempted to defend using the rubber guard, but St-Pierre passed to half-guard and eventually side-control while landing punches. The two continued grappling with Penn taking several ground-and-pound punches from St-Pierre until the round ended.|$|E
5|$|Each {{account is}} {{closed with a}} {{miniature}} woodcut known from {{its position in the}} text as a tail-piece. These small artworks depict aspects of country life, often with humorous subjects, but all with Bewick's eye for detail, style, and precision. Some add to the illustration of the bird in question, as for example the heron, where the tail-piece shows one heron catching an eel, and another flying away. The tail-piece for Sabine's snipe, a gamebird, shows a hunter firing, and a small bird falling to <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>There</b> is no exclusion of human life from the images: one tail-piece depicts a works complete with smoking chimney beside a river.|$|E

5|$|The aerial {{rules of}} {{engagement}} applied in Laos (which prescribed the offensive action of pilots and the locations and circumstances under which offensive actions could be taken) were created to protect the civilian population of the country. To the American pilots that conducted the missions, however, they became complex {{to the point of}} incomprehensibility. The rules were constantly altered and elaborated upon by the political decision makers in Washington and Vientiane and bore little relation to the reality on <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>There</b> were different rules for every type of activity, for each different branch of service, and in each military region.|$|E
5|$|Bootham Crescent was renovated {{over the}} summer of 1932; the Main and Popular Stands were built and {{terraces}} were banked up behind the goals. The ground was officially opened on 31 August 1932, for York's 2–2 draw with Stockport County in the Third Division North. It was played before 8,106 supporters, and York's Tom Mitchell scored the first goal at <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>There</b> were teething problems in Bootham Crescent's early years: attendances were not higher than at Fulfordgate in its first four seasons, and there were questions over {{the quality of the}} pitch. In March 1938 the ground's record attendance was set when 28,123 people watched York play Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup. The ground endured slight damage during the Second World War, when bombs were dropped on houses along the Shipton Street End. Improvements were made shortly after the war ended, including the concreting of the banking at the Grosvenor Road End being completed.|$|E
5|$|The nearest {{railway station}} {{to the stadium}} is Bordesley, on the Birmingham to Stratford Line between Moor Street and Small Heath stations, which has regular {{services}} only on match days. The stadium is a 20-minute walk from New Street station, which is served by direct trains from {{most parts of the}} country, and slightly less far from Moor Street, which is served by Chiltern Railways trains from London Marylebone. Birmingham Coach Station, served by National Express coaches, is a 15-minute walk away, and buses run from the city centre past <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>There</b> is very limited parking at the stadium itself, but a secure outdoor car park is available at Birmingham Wheels Park, less than 15 minutes walk away, and parking is permitted in the streets surrounding the ground.|$|E

25|$|While {{the problem}} {{had long been}} well {{understood}} by planners, {{it is not clear}} that the public understood it as well, or that it widely influenced development, buying or building decisions. Liquefaction risk at the Pegasus Town site was identified in 2005, so the developers spent approximately $20 million on soil compaction, and <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>there</b> held firm during the quake.|$|E

25|$|In March 1996, Rutten faced Lion's Den {{fighter and}} future Ultimate Fighting Championship winner Guy Mezger. Through the fight, Rutten {{dominated}} the stand-up with liver shots and palm strikes, forcing Mezger {{to take him}} down and meet him on <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>There</b> Mezger was able to control Rutten, {{but was unable to}} score a submission, while the Dutch defended and capitalized on the stand-up segments to inflict damage. At the end, after a leglock exchange, Rutten locked a heel hook variation to submit Mezger.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after one}} sees the first flash of intense heat and {{light of the}} {{developing}} nuclear fireball, one should stop, get under some cover and Drop/Duck to <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>There,</b> one should assume a prone-like position, lying face-down, and to afford protection against the continuing heat of the explosion further cover exposed skin {{and the back of}} one's head with one's clothes; or, if no excess cover or cloth is available, one should cover the back of their head and neck with their hands.|$|E

25|$|Northamptonshire first {{played at}} the county ground in Northampton in 1905, and {{continue}} to do so till this day even though Northampton Town F.C. shared the ground up until 1994 when the Cobblers moved to Sixfields Stadium. After the football club moved, the ground at the Abington Avenue was demolished and replaced by a new indoor school which includes seating looking on to the ground. In 2009, Northants cricket announced plans to improve the ground by building two new stands on the scoreboard side of <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>there</b> will also be a permanent commentary box with a view to have a 'mini Lord's' style media centre.|$|E
25|$|The Mongols invaded and {{conquered the}} Khwarazmian dynasty, the King Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu retreated to modern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but was {{defeated}} in the Battle of Indus. The Mongol army advanced and in 1241, the ancient city of Lahore was invaded by 30,000-man cavalry. The Mongols defeated the Lahore governor Malik Ikhtyaruddin Qaraqash and they massacred the entire population and the city was levelled to <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>There</b> are no buildings or monuments in Lahore that predate the Mongol destruction. In 1266, Sultan Balban reconquered Lahore from the Mongols but in 1296 to 1305 the Mongols again overran northern Punjab. In 1298, 200,000 men Mongol army again conquered northern Punjab and committed atrocities then marched to Delhi but was defeated by the Delhi Sultanate.|$|E
25|$|The ground barely {{changed from}} then until the mid-1980s. During {{this time the}} ground had a hump in {{the centre of the}} ground making only the top half of players visible {{from the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>There</b> was a shed for players located where the main {{pavilion}} now stands. There was a hill on the outer (where the hill now is) that could accommodate two rows of vehicles, the small scoreboard stood on the outer close to where the electronic scoreboard is now, and the time clock sat about halfway up a training light tower. The police booth sat, until very recently, in the north-east corner of the oval. A concrete cricket pitch served for local junior teams until the 1956/57 season, when it was replaced by a turf wicket.|$|E

25|$|On 6 January in the Pueblo de los Reyes, {{the main}} {{square of the}} {{community}} is decorated with flower portals and “carpets” made by carefully arranging colored sawdust on <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>There</b> are also processions and a ceremony called the “vítor” used to announce coming of the festival. Reeds are cut and decorated with multicolored crepe paper and half inflated balloons and then are given to children as they pass by on the streets. There is also a parade that features “mojigangas” which are large structures made of cardboard and paper {{in the shape of}} human figures. These are hollow and placed on the shoulders of parade participants. An image of the Nativity and the Three Wise Men is carried through the town on a truck from which bags of candies are tossed to children.|$|E
25|$|In mid 1929 Gertrude Caton-Thompson concluded, after a twelve-day {{visit of}} a three-person {{team and the}} digging of several trenches, that the site was indeed created by Bantu. She had first sunk three test pits into what had been refuse heaps on the upper {{terraces}} of the hill complex, producing a mix of unremarkable pottery and ironwork. She then moved to the Conical Tower, and tried to dig under the tower, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>there</b> would be undisturbed, but nothing was revealed. Some further test trenches were then put down outside the lower Great Enclosure and in the Valley Ruins, which unearthed domestic ironwork, glass beads, and a gold bracelet. Caton-Thompson immediately announced her Bantu origin theory to {{a meeting of the}} British Association in Johannesburg. Caton-Thompson's claim was not immediately favoured, although it had strong support among some scientific archaeologists due to her modern methods. Her most important contribution was in helping to confirm the theory of a medieval origin for the masonry work of circa the 14th-15th century. By 1931, she had modified her Bantu theory somewhat, allowing for a possible Arabian influence for the towers through the imitation of buildings or art seen at the coastal Arabian trading cities.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{task of the}} landscape maintenance is the conservation of the dry and non-forested neglected meadows and dry meadowy slopes. Botanists have named this type of vegetation Magerrasen (neglected grassland). <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>there</b> is covered with thin dry grass and a typical feature are the irregularly spaced juniper bushes. Well over 40 different species of flowering plants grow on this nutrient-poor, non-fertilised soil. Often different small species of gentian can be found. In late summer pasqueflower and Carline thistle bloom. From April until June orange tips fly over the sunny slopes. One of the most {{important task}}s for conservation of the neglected grassland is traditional herding. Grazing with sheep is a prerequisite for the long-lasting conservation of this grassland. If the amount of herding was reduced, initially more thorny and needle-bearing shrubs would grow because these are eschewed by sheep - the large number of juniper bushes thrive for the same reason. Under cover of these thornbushes and hedges other groves and the first trees would develop. In the final stage the mountain would become mostly overgrown with forest. The herbs and grasses of the neglected grassland have a positive influence {{on the quality of the}} sheep's meat. Due to this fact the restaurants of the Hesselberg region increasingly offer dishes of Hesselberg lamb.|$|E
50|$|Elsewhere within <b>the</b> <b>grounds,</b> <b>there</b> is a golf course, football, rugby and cricket pitches, an {{all-weather}} Astro that is {{used for}} hockey throughout the year, tennis courts, and a cricket oval including the 'M-J Pavilion' built in honour of alumnus and cricket commentator Christopher Martin-Jenkins.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>there</b> is {{a bowling}} green, {{possibly}} {{dating from the}} 17th century, {{to the west of}} the house. And there is a sundial, originally at Dryburgh House, 4 ft high, with a square dial stone, a twisted shaft, and a moulded base.|$|R
50|$|Within <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>there</b> is a {{sense of}} {{isolation}} from more recent development. Some early plantings and garden features from the mid 19th century remain and indeed the general arrangement of the early garden is reflected in more recent plantings of the 1970s and 1980s.|$|R
