60|$|It may be {{that the}} enemy will occupy {{positions}} back from the city, out of range of the gunboats, so as to make it desirable to run past Grand Gulf and land at Rodney.

Or, it may be expedient for the boats to run past, but not the men. In this case, then, <b>the</b> <b>transports</b> would have to be brought back to where the men could land and move by forced marches to below Grand Gulf, re-embark rapidly and proceed to the latter place. There will be required, then, three signals; one, to indicate that <b>the</b> <b>transports</b> can run down and debark the troops at Grand Gulf; one, that <b>the</b> <b>transports</b> can run by without the troops; and the last, that <b>the</b> <b>transports</b> can run by with the troops on board.|$|R

5|$|They were {{initially}} {{managed by the}} British Transport Commission, but control passed to British Waterways {{with the passing of}} <b>the</b> <b>Transport</b> Act 1962, which also disbanded <b>the</b> <b>Transport</b> Commission. <b>The</b> <b>Transport</b> Acts of 1968 and 1983 divided British canals into Commercial waterways, which were still carrying commercial traffic, cruising waterways, which had potential for leisure use, and remainder waterways, for which no economic use could be seen at the time. The Stainforth and Keadby was designated as a commercial waterway, and traffic was restricted to working boats carrying freight. With the steady demise of freight traffic, British Waterways encouraged the use of the canals for leisure cruising, walking and fishing, and later recognised their environmental value. Following the cessation of coal carrying from Hatfield Main colliery, and the closure of Dunston's boatyard at Thorne, all use of the canal is now by leisure boaters. A further change of ownership took place in 2012 with the creation of the Canal & River Trust, which took over all of the assets of British Waterways.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} {{statistical}} theory of fields that are transported by a turbulent velocity field, both in forced and in unforced (decaying) experiments. We propose that {{with very few}} provisos on <b>the</b> <b>transporting</b> velocity field, correlation functions of <b>the</b> <b>transported</b> field in <b>the</b> forced case are dominated by statistically preserved structures. In decaying experiments (without forcing <b>the</b> <b>transported</b> fields) we identify infinitely many statistical constants of the motion, which are obtained by projecting the decaying correlation functions on the statistically preserved functions. We exemplify these ideas and provide numerical evidence using a simple model of turbulent transport. This example is chosen for its lack of Lagrangian structure, to stress the generality of <b>the</b> ideas.
