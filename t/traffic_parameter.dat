50|$|A {{false alarm}} for {{incident}} detection {{is not only}} highly undesirable, but seriously damages the confidence in the detection system. Therefore, a near 100% alarm accuracy is needed. This {{does not mean that}} 100% <b>traffic</b> <b>parameter</b> accuracy is required from the traffic sensors; however, the logical commands that analyze the change in traffic parameters need to be selected carefully in order to minimize the probability of false alarms yet detect all major incidents as well as a high percentage of all other incidents. Most importantly, confirmation of incident and evaluation of incident type by manual inspection of a video camera screen is probably the most significant incident detection technique.|$|E

So, combined with GPS vehicle positioning system and the characteristics of <b>traffic</b> flow <b>parameters,</b> the transformation model of <b>traffic</b> <b>parameters</b> in intelligent acquisition system of <b>traffic</b> flow <b>parameters</b> is designed and the data processing and error recovery method are present. The results show that the system, integrated fully the advantage of GPS, can transform GPS coordinates into the features of <b>traffic</b> flow <b>parameters</b> directly, which has an intuitive guide to the traffic management department...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} the bounds on the estimation accuracy of Primary User (PU) <b>traffic</b> <b>parameters</b> with exponentially distributed busy and idle times. We derive closed-form expressions for the Cramer-Rao bounds on the mean squared estimation error {{for the blind}} joint estimation of the PU <b>traffic</b> <b>parameters,</b> specifically, the duty cycle, and the mean arrival and departure rates. Moreover, we present the corresponding maximum-likelihood estimators for the <b>traffic</b> <b>parameters.</b> In addition, we derive a modified likelihood function for the joint estimation of <b>traffic</b> <b>parameters</b> when spectrum sensing errors are considered, and we present the impact of spectrum sensing errors on the estimation error via simulations. Finally, we consider a duty cycle estimator, common in traffic estimation literature, {{that is based on}} averaging the traffic samples. We derive, in closed-form, the mean squared estimation error of the considered estimator under spectrum sensing errors. Comment: accepted to IEEE ICC 2013 [Extended version, with appendices...|$|R

40|$|The use of non-intrusive video-detection {{for traffic}} flow {{observation}} and surveillance {{is the primary}} alternative to conventional inductive loop detector. A Video Image Detection System (VIDS) can derive <b>traffic</b> <b>parameters</b> by means of image processing and pattern recognition methods. Classic systems like the inductive (double) loops or microwave radar detectors are able to measure presence and length of a vehicle but also speed and time gap to the preceding vehicle. Existing VIDS emulates the inductive loop by virtual loops and derives the <b>traffic</b> <b>parameters</b> in a similar way. Additional benefits of the VIDS, e. g. large area observation of traffic flow or detection of special behaviors of single vehicles can not be exploiting in this way. To expand the common approach also for new types of information (queue length or erratic movements), we use a trajectory based recognition algorithm, which {{is related to the}} detection and tracking of individual vehicles in an image sequence. It will be shown as an essential application for this algorithm how the usual characteristic <b>traffic</b> <b>parameters</b> can be derived from the measured trajectories again. A direct comparison between the video based and the classic inductive loop measurement of the <b>traffic</b> <b>parameters</b> is also possible. ...|$|R

In the Reference scenario, the delay is negligible: considering all simulation time along the CWD lane, it reaches the maximum value of 47  s for “charge” vehicles at node 13. This indicates that a delay of 47  s is assessed by considering all 429 “charge” vehicles in 40  minutes of simulation. Consequently, no space–time table will be reported, {{which is consistent with}} the data assumed for this scenario.|$|E

30|$|Based {{on these}} results, we {{proceeded}} {{to use the}} model in order to precompute various traffic scenarios. The precomputation, along with the online simulation, is made based on the <b>traffic</b> <b>parameters</b> declared by the video sources at call setup. These parameters are used for the “identification” of the source as a user adopting a specific “mode”, i.e., a set of <b>traffic</b> <b>parameters.</b> Hence, the sets of <b>traffic</b> <b>parameters</b> presented in Table  1 are denoted as “modes” for the satellite video users, therefore ten “modes” are used. Each “mode” represents a specific Quality of Service that a user wishes to get. Users choose one of the ten “modes” with equal probability (10 %). Also, the “modes” are divided in three groups (of 3, 4 and 3 “modes”, respectively) as shown in Table  1. In each group {{the order of the}} “modes” represents their quality within the group, which is a result of their trace statistics. The placing of each “mode” in a specific group is necessary for our CAC mechanism, discussed in “CAC based on long term user irritation”.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new model based <b>traffic</b> <b>parameter</b> {{estimation}} approach in congested situations in time series of airborne optical remote sensing data. The proposed approach is based on the combination of various techniques: change detection, image processing and incorporation of a priori information such as road network, information about vehicles and roads and finally a traffic model. The change detection in two images with a short time lag of several seconds is implemented using the multivariate alteration detection method resulting in a change image where the moving vehicles on the roads are highlighted. Further, image processing techniques are applied to derive the vehicle density in the binarized change image. Finally, this estimated vehicle density is related to the vehicle density, acquired by modelling the traffic flow for a road segment. The model is derived from a priori information about the vehicle sizes and road parameters, the road network and the spacing between the vehicles. Then, the modelled vehicle density {{is directly related to the}} average vehicle velocity on the road segment and thus the information about the traffic situation can be derived. To confirm our idea and to validate the method several flight campaigns with the DLR airborne experimental wide angle optical 3 K digital camera system operated on a Do- 228 aircraft were performed. Experiments are performed to analyse the performance of the proposed <b>traffic</b> <b>parameter</b> estimation method for highways and main streets in the cities.
