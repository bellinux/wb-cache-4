25|$|The public's {{concern about}} <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> {{and fears of}} {{professional}} politicians allowed the independent candidacy of billionaire Texan Ross Perot to explode {{on the scene in}} dramatic fashion—at one point Perot was leading the major party candidates in the polls. Perot crusaded against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and internal and external national debt, tapping into voters' potential fear of the deficit. His volunteers succeeded in collecting enough signatures to get his name on the ballot in all 50 states. In June, Perot led the national public opinion polls with support from 39% of the voters (versus 31% for Bush and 25% for Clinton). Perot severely damaged his credibility by dropping out of the presidential contest in July and remaining out of the race for several weeks before re-entering. He compounded this damage by eventually claiming, without evidence, that his withdrawal was due to Republican operatives attempting to disrupt his daughter's wedding.|$|E

40|$|In 2013, federal {{personal}} income tax increases were implemented in the U. S. under provisions of two <b>federal</b> statutes: <b>the</b> American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Based on our analysis of data for the time period 1970 - 2008, we argue that the incentives to engage in federal {{personal income}} tax evasion have been increased as {{a direct consequence of}} the public tax-increase policies manifested in these two statutes. To demonstrate this conclusion in the present study, we first present evidence that strongly suggests that {{personal income tax}} evasion has been an increasing function of <b>the</b> maximum marginal <b>federal</b> personal income tax rate over the period 1970 - 2008, which constitutes the most current data currently available on aggregate personal income tax evasion. This evidence leads us then to conclude that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> personal income tax increases implemented effectively in 2013 under provisions of the two aforementioned statutes will result in increased tax evasion behavior and hence lower tax collections. Among other things, then, this public-policy-induced increase in personal income tax evasion also implies that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> in coming years will be greater than projected by the CBO and various government agencies. We also find that, among other things, federal personal income tax evasion has been an increasing function of the unemployment rate. Thus, among other things, there is also evidence that continued high unemployment rates may increase tax evasion and hence <b>the</b> size of <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficits.</b> ...|$|R
25|$|The National Energy Program had {{a number}} of other flaws. It was based on a world price {{steadily}} increasing to $100 per barrel. The world oil price declined to as little as $10 per barrel in the years following. Since the federal government based its spending on the larger figure, the result was that it {{spent a great deal of}} money on subsidies that could not be recovered in taxes on production. Furthermore, due to proximity to the U.S. market companies had opportunities to make money by playing differentials in prices. For instance, refiners in Eastern Canada would import oil subsidized down to half the world price, refine it into products, and export the products to the U.S. at full world price. Airlines flying between Europe and the U.S. via the polar route would take off with as little fuel as possible, and stop briefly in Canada to fill up before continuing on to their destination. Trucking companies operating between locations in the Northern U.S. would detour their trucks through Canada to refuel. None of these transactions was illegal, or even unusual considering the integrated nature of the economies, but all had the effect of transferring billions of Canadian tax dollars to the balance sheets of (mostly foreign owned) companies. A third flaw was that the NEP assumed that future oil discoveries would be made in areas under federal jurisdiction, such as the Arctic and offshore. As it turned out, most of the major oil discoveries in Canada had already been made, and the subsidies given by the federal government to companies exploring in federal jurisdiction were not productive. All of these flaws resulted in large, and unexpected, increases in <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit.</b>|$|E
