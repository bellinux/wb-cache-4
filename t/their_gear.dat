5|$|Trapper: The Trapper-class {{characters}} can use <b>their</b> <b>gear</b> {{to track}} the Monster's movements. As the Monster occasionally scatters local wildlife, such as birds, the trapper can use these 'signs' to find {{the location of the}} monster. Trappers also have other abilities and tools that can slow the movements of the Monster. Following the release of the Stage 2 alpha, all hunters gained the ability to use the mobile arena and the trappers gained the plant scanner ability, similar to the monster's smell.|$|E

Franchise characters are used in Escalation, while players can customize one of four character classes—Scientist, Infiltrator, Destroyer, and Titan—in competitive multiplayer. Autobot and Decepticon Transformers can be customized with parts earned through a ranking system or purchased through the game's marketplace. Several parts from famous Transformers can be used, such as heads, torsos, legs, and arms. Hundreds of pieces and color options are available. Players can also buy and upgrade <b>their</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E

50|$|Helical gear {{flow meters}} get their {{name from the}} shape of <b>their</b> <b>gears</b> or rotors. These rotors {{resemble}} {{the shape of a}} helix, which is a spiral-shaped structure. As the fluid flows through the meter, it enters the compartments in the rotors, causing the rotors to rotate. Flowrate is calculated from the speed of rotation.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the weight that can be dropped easily ('ditched'), some scuba divers add additional fixed weights to <b>their</b> <b>gear,</b> either to reduce the weight placed on the belt, which can cause lower back pain, or to shift the diver's center of mass to achieve the optimum position in the water.|$|E

25|$|In 1979 {{they were}} asked to support Gary Numan on his first major British tour. They were always {{grateful}} to Numan for his help and support.

25|$|Teams were {{no longer}} allowed to change <b>their</b> <b>gear</b> ratios from race to race to suit the {{individual}} demands of a circuit. Instead, they had to nominate eight gear ratios ahead of the first race of the season, and these eight ratios were used at every Grand Prix. They were given one opportunity to change their ratios once the season had started, but any subsequent changes would have incurred a grid penalty.|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{increased}} efficiency of pair trawling, vessels are able to tow <b>their</b> <b>gears</b> in mid-water at a faster speed to target species which are normally able to escape trawl nets, such as the European seabass. This has caused some controversy, due to {{the high level of}} marine mammal bycatch associated, leading to the British government introducing a ban on pair trawling for bass in UK territorial waters.|$|R
60|$|The {{squatter}} {{found his}} children expecting his {{return in the}} usual listless manner with which they awaited all coming events. The cattle were already herded, and the horses in <b>their</b> <b>gears,</b> in readiness to proceed, so soon as he should indicate that such was his pleasure. The children were already in their proper vehicle, and, in short, nothing delayed the departure but {{the absence of the}} parents of the wild brood.|$|R
25|$|On the {{following}} day, Merganser received thirty more rounds of 75-millimeter fire from Kalmagak {{but she was}} not damaged. , USS Seiverling and UN minesweepers were fired upon by approximately seventy-five rounds on December 11. The small minesweepers were forced to slip <b>their</b> <b>gear</b> and use smoke pots to help cover themselves. That same day, USS Waxbill and USS Marshall collided west of Yo-do, Waxbill sustained topside damage to hull fittings but was still operational and otherwise unharmed.|$|E
25|$|Back on Dock Island, Kuzan {{reveals that}} Zephyr is {{targeting}} the three volcanic islands known as End Points. If all three islands erupt {{in a short}} period of time of each other, it would result in a giant eruption covering the world's oceans and killing everyone in them. The Straw Hats confront the Neo Marines on the third End Point and are victorious. Kizaru and the navy confront Zephyr and the Straw Hats but the ex-Admiral allows the Neo Marines, Kuzan and the Straw Hats to escape the island. As Zephyr fights to his death and Ain and Binz mourn their loss, the Straw Hats return to Dock Island, giving <b>their</b> <b>gear</b> and weapons back to Mobston, before going their separate ways.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to being burned out {{from the rest of}} their tour, the band members were growing tired of the encompassing drug scene at their studio space and had entertained selling Bad Earth Studio to Ash before the building lease ran out on them. As they closed down the studio and moved <b>their</b> <b>gear</b> out, the reality of an indefinite hiatus sunk in. Franklin embarked on a solo career that would come to rival his previous band's creative output, first as the experimental electronic pop/folk group Toshack Highway, whose releases ranged from six-piece ensemble works to four-track bedroom recordings, and then as a more traditionally guitar-driven solo artist, continuing to this day as Adam Franklin & Bolts of Melody. Hartridge went on to establish a distribution company. Hindmarsh turned to managing bands full-time under Badearth management, which he founded in March 1998, eventually contracting with Scottish rock band Terra Diablo.|$|E

25|$|Wood {{opened up}} the 1979 season with a loss to Abilene Cooper. The Lions {{suffered}} a second loss to San Angelo Lake View, but Coach Wood was able to scratch nine more wins on his record to claim the district title. The Lions won their first playoff game only to lose, 15 to 11 to Beaumont Hebert in the state quarterfinals. The next season, Coach Wood lost the opening games to Abilene Cooper and Breckenridge. The Lions would tie another non-conference game to Weatherford at 0 before going undefeated {{the rest of the}} season and claiming another district title. 1980 also played another role in Brownwood's history, as Cen-Tex Stadium was renamed Gordon Wood stadium. The Lions inaugurated the stadium's new name with a 34 to 7 victory over Stephenville on October 24. After the regular season, Wood's Lions won the opening round of the playoffs against Wichita Falls Hirschi, but lost to Lubbock Estacado 14 to 0 in the quarterfinals. The Lions turned in <b>their</b> <b>gear</b> with eight wins, three losses, and one tie.|$|E
25|$|The band {{were forced}} to {{postpone}} {{a majority of the}} American Eyes Open tour after polyps were discovered on Lightbody's vocal cords, and failed to heal after initial postponement of three dates on the tour. Dates were rescheduled for August and September. The year would continue to be difficult on the band for the US legs of their tours, as they were also forced to cancel two west coast festival appearances in mid-August due to the threat of terrorist attacks on US-bound flights from the UK. Two band members made it to the US while two were stuck in London. Subsequently, they all made it to the lone US tour stop in Boston days later but failed to recover any of their luggage, forcing them to shop for clothes on Newbury St. that afternoon. <b>Their</b> <b>gear</b> arrived hours before show time, just in time for sound check. The band also had to cancel appearances in Germany and France after bassist Paul Wilson injured his left arm and shoulder.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, Terry Southall, {{the first}} of Coach Southall's three sons, suited out for the Brownwood varsity squad. Coach Wood's team won eight games that season with one loss in non-{{district}} play, but a tie with Breckenridge also meant a tie for the district title. Breckenridge advanced to the state playoffs on penetrations, while the Lions turned in <b>their</b> <b>gear.</b> In 1962, Brownwood went undefeated {{in the regular season}} with Terry Southall leading the way at quarterback. The Lions scored one playoff victory before losing to Dumas 36-18 in the state quarterfinals and ending the season with eleven wins and one loss. 1963 produced a winning season for Brownwood, but two losses to Stephenville and Wichita Falls Rider kept them out of the state finals. The Lions ended the season with eight wins and two losses. 1964 was also a winning season, but seven wins wasn't enough that year. A tie with Graham and two losses to Cleburne and Wichita Falls Hirschi left Brownwood players sitting at home for another playoff series.|$|E
