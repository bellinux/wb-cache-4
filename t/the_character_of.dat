The game is set in 2016, after the events of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and before the events of Terminator Salvation.

The conjugacy classes of the dual correspond to <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primal; indeed <b>the</b> unitary <b>character</b> table <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dual is the inverse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unitary <b>character</b> table <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primal.

5|$|As with The Quatermass Xperiment, the {{screenplay}} for Quatermass 2 condenses {{many of the}} events of the original. The most significant change is at the climax: in the television version Quatermass and his assistant, Pugh, use Quatermass's rocket to travel to the asteroid to take on the aliens on their home turf whereas in the film the rocket is fired, unmanned, at the asteroid to destroy it. Several characters from the television version do not appear in the film, most notably Quatermass's daughter, Paula, and his assistant, Leo Pugh. Conversely, <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> Inspector Lomax reappears in the film version, having previously been in The Quatermass Xperiment, but does not appear in the television version. <b>The</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> Sheila the barmaid also appears only in the film version.|$|E

40|$|A {{short and}} simple {{derivation}} of the formula of Frobenius, {{which gives the}} dimensions of the irreducible representations of Sn, the symmetric group on any number, n, of symbols, is given. These dimensions are <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> identity element of the group, i. e., of the element all of whose cycles are unary. It is shown how a slight modification of Frobenius' formula yields, when n = 2 p is even, <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> an element of Sn all of whose cycles are binary and, when n = 3 p is a multiple <b>of</b> 3, <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> an element of Sn all of whose cycles are ternary and, generally, when n = kp is a multiple of any positive integer k, <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> an element of Sn all of whose cycles are of length k. It is noteworthy that the calculations become simpler, rather than more complicated, as k increases. Finally, this paper shows how to derive from Frobenius' formula <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> an element of Sn which has at least one unary cycle and, from the present modifications <b>of</b> Frobenius' formula, <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> an element of Sn which has at least one cycle of length k, k = 2, 3, [...] ., n...|$|R
