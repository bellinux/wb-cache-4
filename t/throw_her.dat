5|$|Unable to find Bruckman in the hotel, Mulder and Scully {{return to}} Bruckman's {{apartment}} {{to find that}} Bruckman has committed suicide; Scully sees a plastic bag has been tied around his head, {{and that he is}} clutching a bottle of pills in his hand. Scully sits on Bruckman's bed holding his hand, deeply moved, just as he had predicted. That night Scully sees a commercial for the Stupendous Yappi on TV, causing her to <b>throw</b> <b>her</b> phone at it.|$|E
5|$|As Scully {{heads to}} the other room to get ready, her FBI badge falls out of her coat pocket. Scully discreetly picks it back up without Ed noticing.

An FBI operator answers and, upon learning that Scully is an FBI agent, the tattoo forces Ed to attack her. Scully tries to escape but is overpowered by Ed, who wraps her in a bedsheet and carries her {{down to the basement}} to <b>throw</b> <b>her</b> in the furnace. At the last moment, Ed is able to overpower the impulses of the tattoo and instead thrusts his own arm into the furnace.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} French frigates closed-up {{for mutual}} protection. At 10:00, Monarch engaged Minerve and Armide, {{as the weather}} prevented Monarch from opening her lower gun ports, she was badly mauled. An hour later, Centaur caught up and began firing at Armide and Gloire, leaving Monarch to continue her fight with Minerve. Armide struck to Centaur at 11:45 and Minerve surrendered to Monarch shortly after. Gloire veered west {{in an attempt to}} <b>throw</b> <b>her</b> pursuers but Centaur and Mars chased her down and forced her to strike at 15:00.|$|E
5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to <b>throw</b> <b>her</b> into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
5|$|In April 1770, Endeavour {{became the}} first ship to reach {{the east coast of}} Australia, when Cook went ashore at what is now known as Botany Bay. Endeavour then sailed north along the Australian coast. She {{narrowly}} avoided disaster after running aground on the Great Barrier Reef, and Cook had to <b>throw</b> <b>her</b> guns overboard to lighten her. He then beached her on the mainland for seven weeks to permit rudimentary repairs to her hull. On 10 October 1770, she limped into port in Batavia (now named Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies for more substantial repairs, her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands they had visited. She resumed her westward journey on 26 December, rounded the Cape of Good Hope on 13 March 1771, and reached the English port of Dover on 12 July, having been at sea for nearly three years.|$|E

5|$|Bond calls Tree to enquire further {{about the}} payment of his fee and is told {{to go to the}} Tiara Hotel in Las Vegas. The Tiara is owned by Seraffimo Spang and {{operates}} as the headquarters of the Spangled Mob. Spang also owns an old Western ghost town, named Spectreville, restored to be his own private holiday retreat. At the hotel Bond finally receives payment through a rigged blackjack game where the dealer is Tiffany. After winning the money he is owed he disobeys his orders from Tree by continuing to gamble in the casino and wins heavily. Spang suspects that Bond may be a 'plant' and has him captured and tortured at Spectreville. With Tiffany's help he escapes from Spectreville aboard a railway push-car with Seraffimo Spang in pursuit aboard an old Western train. Bond changes the points and re-routes the train onto a dead-end, and shoots Spang before the resulting crash. Assisted by Leiter, Bond and Tiffany go via California to New York, where they board the RMS Queen Elizabeth to travel to London, a relationship developing between them as they go. Wint and Kidd observe their embarkation and follow them on board. They kidnap Tiffany, planning to kill her and <b>throw</b> <b>her</b> overboard. Bond rescues her and kills both gangsters; he makes it look like a murder-suicide.|$|E

President made a cartel of Duke of Montrose, putting all of Presidents prisoners on board and then sending her into Falmouth {{under the command of}} an American officer. When Duke of Montrose arrived at Falmouth the British Government abrogated the cartel {{on the grounds that they}} had advised the American Government that the British would not recognize agreements entered into on the high seas.|$|E

The false escort prepared by Tarō and Hyōe to take Kan Shōjō away thus leaves with his passenger.|$|E
