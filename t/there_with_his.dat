By 1539, the power struggle between Montejo and Pedro de Alvarado drew {{the attention of the}} Council of the Indies; as a result Alvarado once again became governor of Honduras. Alvarado returned to Honduras in April 1539; Montejo travelled to Gracias, where he was forced to concede the governorship, and then left for Chiapas.|$|E

5|$|Chadwick did {{not believe}} that there was any {{likelihood}} of another war with Germany in 1939, and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of the outbreak of the Second World War therefore came as a shock. Determined not to spend another war in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to Stockholm as fast as he could, but when he arrived <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a tramp steamer. When he reached Liverpool, Chadwick found Joseph Rotblat, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.|$|E

5|$|Charles Patrick John Coghlan {{was born}} on 24 June 1863 in King William's Town, British Kaffraria (part of the Cape Colony from 1866). He had three elder brothers. His father, James Coghlan, was from Ireland and was a Catholic; he had arrived in South Africa in 1851 as a private in the British Army, having enlisted to escape the Irish Potato Famine. After {{fighting}} in the Eighth Xhosa War of 1850–53 with the 2nd (The Queen's Royal) Regiment of Foot, James was stationed in the Keiskamma mountains; he settled <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wife Isabella Mary (née Maclaren), who was originally from Dumbartonshire, Scotland.

5|$|From December 1559 Amy Dudley {{lived at}} Cumnor Place, near Abingdon in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire). The house, an altered 14th century monastic complex, was rented {{by a friend}} of the Dudleys and {{possible}} relative of Amy's, Sir Anthony Forster. He lived <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wife and Mrs. Odingsells and Mrs. Owen, relations of the house's owner. Lady Dudley's chamber was a large, sumptuous upper story apartment, the best of the house, with a separate entrance and staircase leading up to it. At the house's rear there were a terrace garden, a pond, and a deer park. Amy Dudley received the proceeds of the Robsart estate directly into her hands and largely paid for her own household, which comprised about 10 servants. She regularly ordered dresses and finery as accounts and a letter from her of as late as 24August 1560 show. She also received presents from her husband.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} austerity of post-war Britain, Larwood's business made little money. He was persuaded, largely by his erstwhile opponent Jack Fingleton, {{that he would}} find better prospects and a warm welcome in Australia, {{and he decided to}} emigrate <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> family, which by then included five daughters. On 1 April 1950 the Larwoods sailed on SS Orontes—the ship that had carried Jardine's party 18 years previously. On arrival in Australia the welcome was warm and immediate. During their initial weeks in a Sydney hotel, unbeknown to them half their bills were paid by the former prime minister Ben Chifley. Despite a housing shortage, the family was soon settled in a bungalow in the Sydney suburb of Kingsford, and Larwood found steady employment with a soft drinks firm. Fingleton later arranged a meeting between Larwood and Chifley; their respective broad Nottinghamshire and Australian accents meant that neither could understand the other, and Fingleton had to act as an interpreter.|$|E

Marsiti is sent away by the elder Oh and, after Aij Tjeng orders his manservant Tirta to find her, Tirta disappears as well. After the marriage, Aij Tjeng finds in Gwat Nio all of the same traits which made him fall in love with Marsiti, but even more polished owing to her better education. He falls in love with her and begins to forget Marsiti, and the couple have a daughter, Lily.|$|E
5|$|The Mew Project {{was started}} by Ryô's father, Dr. Shirogane, five years before Tokyo Mew Mew is set. The manga never {{explains}} why the project was started or how they knew about Chimera Animas and the aliens, but Dr. Shirogane does mention that they must learn how to inject animal genes into human DNA in order to fight the aliens. In the anime adaptation, Dr. Shirogane discovered the fossilized remains of an ancient civilization called the Chimera during an archaeological dig and began researching the race of people who lived <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> assistant Keiichirô Akasaka. This would eventually become the Mew Project. A laboratory explosion and a fire that kills Dr. Shirogane and his wife, leaving then 10-year-old Ryô orphaned.

The fifth William Davenport {{inherited}} Bramall in 1585 from his father {{of the same name}}, and lived <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wife Dorothy for over 50 years. The first marriage in Bramall's chapel was recorded in 1599, between William (aged 15), eldest son of the fifth William and Dorothy, and Frances Wilbraham (aged 11).

During the tenure of the fifth William, many alterations were made to the building, including the addition of a room above the Great Hall (which would later become the Withdrawing Room), and a long gallery. The internal decorations were also updated with additions such as wall paintings and portraits.|$|E
