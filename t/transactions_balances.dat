40|$|Has the {{introduction}} of interest-bearing NOW accounts altered the nature of M 1 ? That monetary aggregate, of course, is intended to measure purely <b>transactions</b> <b>balances</b> as typified by conventional checking accounts.

40|$|In 1995, {{the broad}} {{aggregate}} M 2 + grew {{at an annual}} rate of 4. 5 per cent [...] almost twice the rate recorded in 1994 [...] as competition from mutual funds drew less money from personal savings deposits. An adjusted M 2 + aggregate, which internalizes the effect of close substitutes such as CSBs and certain mutual funds, grew by only 3. 4 per cent. Gross M 1 grew by 8. 2 per cent during the year, reflecting an increased demand for <b>transactions</b> <b>balances</b> as market interest rates declined and as banks offered more attractive rates of interest on corporate current account balances. The robust growth of gross M 1 in the second half of 1995 suggests a moderate expansion of economic activity in the first half of 1996, while moderate growth in the broad aggregates indicates a rate of monetary expansion consistent with continued low inflation. In this annual review of the monetary aggregates, the authors also introduce a new model, based on calculated deviations of M 1 from its long-run demand, which suggests that inflation should remain just below the midpoint of the inflation-control target range over the next couple of years. ...|$|E

40|$|In its {{conduct of}} {{monetary}} policy, the Bank of Canada carefully monitors {{the pace of}} monetary expansion for indications about the outlook for inflation and economic activity. In recent years, {{a number of factors}} have distorted the growth of the traditional broad and narrow aggregates. In this article, the authors discuss the uncertainty surrounding the classification of deposit instruments that has resulted from the elimination of reserve requirements and from other financial innovations. They introduce twonew measures of <b>transactions</b> <b>balances,</b> M 1 + and M 1 ++ (described more fully in a technical note in this issue of the Review), that internalize some of the substitutions that have occurred. They attribute the deceleration in M 1 growth in 1998 partly to the declining influence of special factors, partly to a lagged response to interest rate increases in 1997 and early 1998, and partly to some temporary tightening in credit conditions in the autumn of 1998. The broad monetary aggregate M 2 ++, which includes all personal savings deposits, life insurance annuities, and mutual funds, grew at a steady pace in 1998, presaging growth of about 4 to 5 per cent in total dollar spending and inflation inside the target range. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the developments in the monetary aggregates {{over the course of}} 1997 and their implications for future economic activity. The narrow aggregate, M 1, grew rapidly {{in the first half of}} 1997 but slowed somewhat during the second half of the year. Much of the strong growth in this aggregate over the last several years has been associated with a higher demand for <b>transactions</b> <b>balances</b> as interest rates declined and economic activity revived. There were some special factors at play, however, that are discussed in the article. The Bank expects some slowing in M 1 growth through 1998 and into 1999. This would be consistent with a trend of inflation within the inflation-control target range of 1 to 3 per cent over the next couple of years. Growth in the broad aggregate, M 2 +, continued to be distorted by the shift of savings out of fixed-term deposits into mutual funds. A broader aggregate that includes M 2 +, CSBs, and all mutual funds and thus provides a better estimate of broad money growth, grew at a moderate pace during 1997. The recent behaviour of the broad monetary aggregates continues to suggest that inflation will remain low in coming years. ...|$|E

This study is an analysis of the velocity of circulation and its recent behavior. The demand for real balances relative to real income depends upon transactions requirements and on the factors which affect the size of <b>transactions</b> <b>balances.</b> Both goods transactions and asset transactions are shown {{to play a role in}} the determination of the velocity of circulation. The expected rate of inflation is shown to play a role in the pattern of velocity over time. The impact of financial and goods market volatility play a role as risk factors in the determination of the demand for real balances relative to real income. The goal of this study is to present a model of the velocity of circulation which makes use of changes in financial markets and swings in inflationary expectations to explain the apparent breakdown in the relationship between money and income. The major difference between the theory developed here and the theory which formed the basis for most of the previous studies is the emphasis placed on the transactions motive for holding money and the de-emphasis of the role of money as an asset serving some liquidity preference motive or speculative motive. The major conclusions of the study are that including measures for financial transactions, inflationary expectations, intermediate goods transactions, and risk factors in a velocity of circulation analysis helps to explain much of the movement of velocity over time. The error structure of the model is analyzed using both spectral analysis and the error correction techniques commonly used to study the dynamics of co-integrated time series...|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores {{money manager}} intertemporal {{arbitrage}} {{as an explanation}} of the liquidity effect. We develop a theoretical model of optimal portfolio adjustment by professional money managers, and show that they engage in intertemporal asset price arbitrage; they reduce their holdings of financial assets when they expect asset prices to fall, and increase their holdings when they expect prices to rise. Since a reduction in financial assets can only be accomplished through an increase in money holdings, a connection exists between intertemporal price arbitrage and speculative balances. We show that in equilibrium, money manager behavior causes market liquidity shocks to be accompanied by a form of asset price overshooting in which asset prices first rise above their long-run value and then slowly return as speculative balances are lent out to borrowers and absorbed into <b>transactions</b> <b>balances.</b> Such asset price overshooting is precisely the liquidity effect, stated in terms of asset prices rather than interest rates. This shadows the result established by Hartley (1990), who showed that the combination of sector-specific liquidity shocks and trading rigidities across sectors will cause general price overshooting in those sectors closest to the money supply injection. The second part of this thesis attempts to identify an empirical relationship between speculative balances and asset prices as a means of verifying the hypothesis that money manager intertemporal price arbitrage generates the liquidity effect. It is not possible to estimate this relationship on an aggregate level because no means exist to identify speculative balances relative to the total money supply. However, it is possible to test if individual money managers engage in intertemporal price arbitrage. We do so by estimating individual institutional investor demand for speculative balances. The data source we use is the Flow of Funds, which gives money holdings for various groups of institutional investors. We find an elasticity of 0. 1 for speculative balances with respect to the stock market price-earnings ratio...|$|E
