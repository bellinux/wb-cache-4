5|$|The Patries {{envelope}} {{was composed}} of four alternating layers of cotton cloth and vulcanised rubber (the envelope of its predecessor, the Jaune, comprised three layers). The outside layer was of cotton cloth, covered with lead chromate to prevent the actinic components of sunlight from destroying <b>the</b> <b>rubber</b> skin which formed the second layer. This second layer prevented leakage of the hydrogen lifting gas from the envelope. The third layer was of cotton, which was protected by <b>the</b> <b>rubber</b> fourth and final layer from damage caused by the hydrogen. This final rubber layer was thinner, and therefore lighter, than the first. <b>The</b> <b>rubber</b> sheeting for the second and fourth layers was supplied by the German company Continental AG.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{published}} in <b>the</b> Journal of <b>Rubber</b> Research. This study prepared a natural rubber/polybutadiene (NR/BR: 50 / 50 wt%) blend using precipitated amorphous white silica filler the surface {{of which had been}} pre-treated with bis-(3 -triethoxysilylpropyl) -tetrasulphane (TESPT). TESPT is a sulphur-bearing bifunctional organosilane, which chemically bonds silica to <b>rubber</b> via <b>the</b> sulphur to form strong rubber-silica interaction. <b>The</b> <b>rubbers</b> were primarily cured by using sulphur in TESPT, and the cure was optimised by adding sulphenamide accelerator, zinc oxide activator and elemental sulphur. The chemical bonding between the sulphur in TESPT and <b>the</b> <b>rubbers</b> was affected mainly by the addition of the chemical curatives. In the absence of full chemical bonding between the sulphur in TESPT and <b>the</b> <b>rubbers,</b> most of <b>the</b> mechanical properties of the blend were inferior. But when chemical bonds or crosslinks fully formed between the sulphur in TESPT and <b>the</b> <b>rubbers,</b> <b>the</b> tensile strength, elongation at break, stored energy density at break, tear energy, cyclic fatigue life and abrasion resistance were enhanced. For example, the cyclic fatigue life of the blend increased by almost 50, 000 times, which was a major improvement...|$|R

5|$|By 1901 {{there were}} so few rubber plants left in the {{concession}} that the Free State authorities granted permission for the villagers to cut down the remaining plants and grind their bark to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>rubber.</b> Once this process was completed <b>the</b> <b>rubber</b> tax was abolished. The Abir company merged with the Société Anversoise in May 1911 to form the Compagnie du Congo Belge and now focussed on the management of rubber plantations and the gathering of rubber from them. However, later that year it agreed with the Belgian government {{to reduce the size}} of its operations and its monopoly status. In July 1911 it was banned from collecting rubber within the confines of its old concession for 18 months and was subject to new laws introduced by the Free State. The later history of the company is unknown but it continued to operate until at least 1926 when it split off its oil palm concessions into the Maringa company.|$|E

It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing <b>the</b> <b>rubber</b> stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E
5|$|Abir {{collected}} 70 tons {{of dried}} rubber in 1895, rising to 410 tons in 1898 {{by which time}} it had eleven operational posts. At {{the same time the}} price of rubber also increased from 6.30–6.50 fr per kilogram in 1894 to 8.04–10.00 fr per kilogram in 1898. Abir's costs in 1897 amounted to 0.25 fr per kilogram to purchase <b>the</b> <b>rubber</b> from the collectors (in lieu of tax), 0.4 fr for transportation, 0.25 in export duty paid to the Congo Free State and 0.45 for storage for a total cost of 1.35 fr per kilogram. In the same year Abir could sell on <b>the</b> <b>rubber</b> in Europe for up to 10 fr per kilogram. Abir's profits rose with the increasing quantity and price of rubber, for the first two years (1892–94) the company recorded a total profit of 131,340 fr, this had increased almost twentyfold by 1898 when they recorded a 2,482,697 fr profit just for one year. As a result, the dividend paid in 1898 was 1,100 fr per 500 fr share. These profits were made in spite of increasing costs due the doubling of export duty in 1892 and the construction of the Leopoldville-Matadi railway in 1894 which increased the cost of moving rubber to the coast to 0.63 fr per kilo, more than the entire trip to Antwerp had taken in 1892.|$|E

In 1929, Michelin built its first rail car, and by 1932 nine of its cars were in operating service, all of which featured innovative and distinctive pneumatic tires. The company claimed that its application of tires on its rail cars afforded both a substantially more cushioned ride and increased the cars' traction by 35%.

5|$|Galiella rufa, {{commonly}} known as <b>the</b> <b>rubber</b> cup, the rufous rubber cup, or the hairy rubber cup, is a species of fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. The fungus produces cup-shaped fruit bodies that typically grow in clusters on branches and exposed portions of buried wood throughout eastern and Midwest North America and in Malaysia. The fruit bodies have the texture of tough, gelatinous rubber, and have a rough, blackish-brown, felt-like outer surface and a smooth reddish-brown inner surface. Although generally considered inedible by North American mushroom field guides, it is commonly consumed in Malaysia. The fungus produces several chemicals {{with a variety of}} bioactive properties.|$|E

Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature and has <b>the</b> <b>rubber</b> stamp of the Emperor.
