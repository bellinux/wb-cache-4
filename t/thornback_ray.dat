5|$|The thornback {{guitarfish}} was scientifically {{described by}} American ichthyologists David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert in an 1880 {{issue of the}} scientific journal Proceedings of the United States National Museum. They assigned it to the genus Platyrhina, and named it triseriata from the Latin tres ("three") and series ("row"), {{in reference to the}} three rows of thorns on its back. One year later in the same journal, Samuel Garman placed this species in a newly created genus, Platyrhinoidis. The type specimen is an adult male caught off Santa Barbara on February 8, 1880. Other common names for this species include banjo shark (not {{to be confused with the}} Australian banjo sharks, Trygonorrhina), California thornback, guitarfish, round skate, shovelnose, thornback, and <b>thornback</b> <b>ray.</b>|$|E

40|$|This Fisheries Science Partnership {{project was}} {{developed}} to estimate the survival of rays, which are caught commercially in a target trawl fishery in the Bristol Channel, and subsequently discarded. The study was proposed by the NFFO and categorized by Defra and Cefas as priority for support. All ray and skate species are commonly marketed as skate. The status of several skate and ray stocks in the Northeast Atlantic is of concern, with some species classified as depleted while others are locally extirpated. The objectives {{of this study were}} to (1) estimate the short-term discard survival rates of thornback rays; (2) estimate the longterm discard survival rates of the most commercially important ray species; and (3) investigate the effect of codend weight on ray discard survival. The short-term survival estimates were made using specially designed holding tanks to retain <b>thornback</b> <b>rays</b> on board during three 4 -day trips on the FV ‘Our Olivia Belle’. These holding tank experiments were supplemented with a tagging programme in which 900 thornback, small-eyed, blonde and spotted rays were caught, tagged and released. Information on tagged rays, when caught again in the future, will be used to estimate the longer-term survival of discarded rays. Consequently, the results from the tagging programme can only be presented once sufficient tags have been returned, and will be included in a future report. The short-term survival experiments showed that for every three <b>thornback</b> <b>rays</b> returned to sea in the Bristol Channel ray fishery, an estimated two survive for at least 3 days. The few tag returns received so far show that discarded rays are surviving for at least 45 days. The study indicated that as total catch weight and tow duration increases, the survival rate for discarded rays decreases; also, that large <b>thornback</b> <b>rays</b> do not have greater rates of survival than small rays. The implications of these results for the management of ray fisheries are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{depleted}} {{throughout the}} European continental shelf, {{the relatively high}} density of <b>thornback</b> <b>rays</b> Raja clavata, in the Thames Estuary (UK) makes it an important stock centre and potential focus for species management. To describe spatial and temporal distribution, 197 <b>thornback</b> <b>rays</b> were tagged with electronic data storage tags (DSTs) and released in theThames Estuary in October 1999 and 2000, and 100 rays tagged with conventional tags in 2000. Fifty-one per cent of DSTs and 48 % of conventional tags were returned. Fishery-independent estimates of position (‘geolocations’) between the time of release and recapture using the tidal location method were possible using 75 individual data records of between 31 and 423 days. Ninety-six per cent of rays were recaptured within the Thames Estuary. The rays were located in water of 20 ^ 35 m depth during the autumn and winter, then migrated into shallower water (520 m depth) during the spring. Fishery-independent analysis of distribution demonstrated that the rays were more widely distributed in the southern North Sea during the autumn and winter. The range contracted in spring, when the ¢sh moved into the inner Thames Estuary. No gross behaviour di¡erences were observed between males and females. Displacement and dispersion coe⁄cients calculated from geolocation data demonstrated clear annual cycles, indicative of migration. These movements were not apparent from the mark ^ recapture data, a ¢shery-related e¡ect. The extent of migration as determined from experiments with DSTs was approximately three times greater than that suggested by conventional tagging data alone...|$|R

Using 5 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci, we analyzed egg clutches collected from 4 female Raja clavata captured in the wild to test for multiple paternity. Using the reconstructed multilocus genotypes method to explain the progeny genotype array, we showed that all 4 clutches were sired by a minimum of 4 – 6 fathers and, thus, female <b>thornback</b> <b>rays</b> are polyandrous.

40|$|A {{total of}} 732 <b>Thornback</b> <b>Rays</b> (R. clavata) were {{examined}} for length, wingspan, weight, sex and food in two bays {{on the west}} coast of Ireland. The samples were taken by rod and line during angling festivals in Clew Bay in June 1971 and in Broadhaven Bay in September 1971. The length/wingspan relationship for both sexes in both areas was found to be linear and the wingspan/weight relationship was the same for both sexes. The males become mature between 15. 0 and 17. 0 inches (38 to 43 cm) wingspan, while the females become mature between 18. 0 and 20. 0 inches (45. 5 to 50. 5 cm) wingspan. The sex ratio of males to females in each of the two samples was 1 : 1 in Clew Bay and 1. 4 : 1 in Broadhaven Bay. The main food items in the stomachs of the rays from Clew Bay were Macropipus spp. (44 per cent), Crangon (23 per cent), Carcinus (21 per cent) and Lamellibranchs (10 per cent). In Broadhavcn Bay Ammodytidae (21. 5 per cent), other fishes (19. 5 per cent) and Macropipus spp. (14 per cent) formed the bulk of food items. A total of 71 R. clavata were tagged in Broadhaven Bay in the summer of 1971 and to date there have been 8 recaptures 7 within Broadhaven Bay.

40|$|Predator {{avoidance}} {{is fundamental}} for survival {{and it can}} be particularly challenging for prey animals if physical movement away from a predatory threat is restricted. Many sharks and rays begin life within an egg capsule that is attached to the sea bed. The vulnerability of this sedentary life stage is exacerbated in skates (Rajidae) as the compulsory ventilatory activity of embryos makes them conspicuous to potential predators. Embryos can reduce this risk by mediating ventilatory activity if they detect the presence of a predator using an acute electrosense. To determine how early in embryonic life predator elicited behavioral responses can occur, the reactions of three different age groups (1 / 3 developed, 2 / 3 developed, and near hatching) of embryonic <b>thornback</b> <b>rays</b> Raja clavata were tested using predator-type electric field stimuli. Egg capsules were exposed to continuous or intermittent stimuli in order to assess varying predator-type encounter scenarios on the ventilatory behavior of different developmental stages. All embryos reacted with a “freeze response” following initial electric field (E-field) exposure, ceasing ventilatory behavior in response to predator presence, demonstrating electroreceptive functionality {{for the first time at}} the earliest possible stage in ontogeny. This ability coincided with the onset of egg ventilatory behavior and may represent an effective means to enhance survival. A continuous application of stimuli over time revealed that embryos can adapt their behavior and resume normal activity, whereas when presented intermittently, the E-field resulted in a significant reduction in overall ventilatory activity across all ages. Recovery from stimuli was significantly quicker in older embryos, potentially indicative of the trade-off between avoiding predation and adequate respiration. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Sharks, {{skates and rays}} {{all have}} Ampullae of Lorenzini. Nowadays these ampullae are {{generally}} accepted as being electroreceptors, with which the animals can sense the (bio) electric fields in their environment. Much biophysical research {{has been carried out}} on these electroreceptors, but most of the experiments were conducted under biologically invalid 'in vitro' situations and the properties of the ampullae were therefore greatly influenced. It is important to reevaluate the data obtained to date under biologically more adequate and 'in vivo' conditions. In this report the results of 'in vivo 'experiments on live, anaesthetized <b>thornback</b> <b>rays</b> are described. One of the goals was to perform the experiments on fully submerged animals. The only difficulty we had to overcome was that by submerging the animal, the canal would no longer be insulated and the nerve signals would no longer be measurable. At the present time no solution has been found for this problem. The decision was therefore made to temperarely record the nerve spikes (as a measurement of the activity of the ampulla) without submerging the animal yet. The activity of the nerves to different porepositive, hyperpolarizing stimuli was recorded. With the current set-up we were able to conduct experiments on the animal up to several days, this in contrast to other workers who were only able to make stable recordings up to several hours. We found some differences with the results of previous workers, which could be a result of the differences in the experimental conditions. In our experiments we found a clearly visible reaction of the ampulla to stimuli with a frequency of up to 12 Hz. At higher frequencies the response was less evident. The oscillations we recorded did not respond to any of the stimuli in any way. This is a sharp contrast to what other researchers found and contradicts their explanation of the high sensitivity. They are however physiologically real and are probably more than just artifacts. The way to get answers to these questions is to continue with trying to conduct the experiments under biologically more valid conditions (i. e., by fully submerging the animal) and under more controlled circumstances (i. e., computer controlled amplitude, frequency and time base settings for the stimuli). A program to solve this last problem is already being developed. Another way to get the answers would be with intra-cellular recordings (sofar unsuccesfull). ...|$|R

40|$|A key {{challenge}} of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management is to sustain viable populations of large-bodied less-productive vulnerable elasmobranchs that are the by-catch of fisheries that target more productive species. The North Sea population of the <b>thornback</b> <b>ray</b> (Raja clavata) is now mainly confined to the Thames Estuary and surrounding SW North Sea, which is subject to a flatfish trawl fishery. We explored the relative effectiveness of seasonal closures versus size-based landing restrictions using a four-season age-structured model.

A three-season closure of the Thames Estuary was the shortest closure that ensured <b>thornback</b> <b>ray</b> recovery and minimal loss of fishery yield. Minimum and maximum landing size restrictions are nearly as effective at recovering thornback rays but less so at improving yield. While long seasonal closures and full marine protected areas are more effective at ensuring the recovery of thornback rays, length restrictions may be simpler to implement under the current institutional framework and may have less impact on the multispecies trawl fisheries operating in the area...|$|E

Since then, it has decreased in abundance and geographic range due to over-fishing. The sustainability of ray populations is of concern to fisheries management because their slow growth rate, late maturity and low fecundity make them susceptible to exploitation as victims of by-catch. We investigated the population genetic structure of thornback rays from 14 locations in the southern North Sea, English Channel and Irish Sea. Adults comprised < 4 % of the total sampling despite heavy sampling effort over 47 hauls; thus our results apply mainly to sexually immature individuals.

40|$|Abstract How have North Sea skate and shark assemblages {{changed since}} the early 20 th century when bottom {{trawling}} became widespread, whilst their environment became increasingly impacted by fishing, climate change, habitat degradation and other anthropogenic pressures? This article examines long-term changes in the distribution and occurrence of the elasmobranch assemblage of the southern North Sea, based on extensive historical time series (1902 – 2013) of fishery-independent survey data. In general, larger species (<b>thornback</b> <b>ray,</b> tope, spurdog) exhibited long-term declines, and the largest (common skate complex) became locally extirpated (as did angelshark). Smaller species increased (spotted and starry ray, lesser-spotted dogfish) as did smooth-hound, likely benefiting from greater resilience to fishing and/or climate change. This indicates a fundamental shift from historical dominance of larger, commercially valuable species to current prevalence of smaller, more productive species often of low commercial value. In recent years, however, some trends have reversed, with the (cold-water associated) starry ray now declining and <b>thornback</b> <b>ray</b> increasing. This shift {{may be attributed to}} (i) fishing, including mechanised beam trawling introduced in the 1960 s– 1970 s, and historical target fisheries for elasmobranchs; (ii) climate change, currently favouring warm-water above cold-water species; and (iii) habitat loss, including potential degradation of coastal and outer estuarine nursery habitats. The same anthropogenic pressures, here documented to have impacted North Sea elasmobranchs over the past century, are likewise impacting shelf seas worldwide and may increase in the future; therefore, parallel changes in elasmobranch communities in other regions are to be expected...|$|E
40|$|The <b>thornback</b> <b>ray</b> (Raja clavata) in the Bay of Biscay {{is presumed}} to have {{declined}} during the 20 th Century. To evaluate this decline and estimate biomass trajectories, a hypothetical catch time series was created for the period 1903 - 2013. A Bayesian state-space biomass production model with a Schaefer production function was fitted to the hypothetical catch time series and to a shorter research vessel Catch Per Unit Eeffort (CPUE) time series (1973 - 2013, with missing years). A censored likelihood {{made it possible to}} obtain biomass estimates without a CPUE time series or only with an estimate of biomass depletion. A simulation-estimation approach showed a high sensitivity of results to the prior for the intrinsic growth rate. The model provided biomass trajectories which corroborated and quantified the decline of the Bay of Biscay population. The estimated biomass corresponding to the maximum sustainable yield, BMSY, was 32 000 tonnes, which is 17 times higher than the estimated biomass in 2014. The biomass estimates obtained without a CPUE time series were highly uncertain. Adding a current biomass depletion observation improved precision, though the biomass time trend was sensitive to this value. Results should be interpreted carefully as several assumptions were necessary to create the long catch time series and to define informative priors, notably for the intrinsic growth rate. Despite this, the results confirm the depleted state of the <b>thornback</b> <b>ray</b> in the Bay of Biscay with the estimated biomass in 2014 being around 3 % of carrying capacity...|$|E
40|$|Tope shark (Galeorhinus galeus) and <b>thornback</b> <b>ray</b> (Raja clavata) are the {{two most}} {{captured}} elasmobranch species by the Azorean bottom longline fishery. In order to better understand the trophic dynamics of these species in the Azores, the diets of <b>thornback</b> <b>ray</b> and tope shark caught in this area during 1996 and 1997 were analyzed to describe feeding patterns and to investigate the effect of sex, size, and depth and area of capture on diet. Thornback rays fed mainly upon fishes and reptants, but also upon polychaetes, mysids, natant crustaceans, isopods, and cephalopods. In the Azores, this species preyed more heavily upon fish compared with the predation patterns described in other areas. Differences in the diet may be due to differences in the environments (e. g. in the Azores, seamounts and oceanic islands are the major topographic features, whereas in all other studies, continental shelves have been the major topographic feature). No differences were observed in the major prey consumed between the sexes or between size classes (49 − 60, 61 − 70, 71 − 80, and 81 − 93 cm TL). Our study indicates that rays inhabiting different depths and areas (coastal or offshore banks) prey upon different resources. This appears {{to be related to the}} relative abundance of prey with habitat. Tope sharks were found to prey almost exclusively upon teleost fish: small shoaling fish, mainly boarfish (Capros aper) and snipefish (Macroramphosus scolopax), were the most frequent prey.

The migration was reconstructed using the tidal location method, and illustrates seasonal migration out of the Thames Estuary to the central southern North Sea during autumn and winter, then {{a return to the}} Thames to spawn during spring. This is the first direct evidence of repeated seasonal migration outside the area commonly thought of as the species home range, an observation with significant implications regarding the applicability of closure management as a conservation measure for this species...|$|E
40|$|The sensory {{determination}} of ammonia in raw, steamed and boiled ray wings using a scoring system {{appeared to be}} a valuable method of quality assessment. The borderline of acceptability was reached after 10 (± 1) days in ice. A combination of the steaming and boiling tests (with addition of acetic acid and salt) was useful to confirm definite spoilage or to indicate the approach to the borderline of acceptability. The chemical {{determination of}} ammonia {{appeared to be a}} useful objective method in addition to the organoleptic tests. <b>Thornback</b> <b>ray</b> was borderline at a concentration of 60 – 70 mg N. From the other related parameters determined (urea, pH, redox potential, total bacterial count, a-amino nitrogen) only pH appeared to be of value...|$|E
