40|$|Abstract Background Tartrate-resistant acid {{phosphatase}} (TRAP) is a metalloprotein enzyme {{that belongs to}} the {{acid phosphatase}}s and {{is known to be}} expressed by osteoclasts. It has already been investigated as a marker of bone metastases in cancer patients. In this study, which examined the value of serum TRAP concentrations as a marker of bone disease in breast cancer patients, we observed high concentrations of TRAP even in patients without bone metastases. To elucidate this phenomenon, we examined the expression of TRAP in breast cancer cells and the cells of several other malignancies. Methods TRAP concentrations in the serum of tumor patients were determined by ELISA. The expression of TRAP in breast, ovarian, and cervical cancer and malignant melanoma was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR and immunocytology were used to evaluate TRAP expression in cultured tumor cells. Results A marked increase in serum TRAP concentrations was observed in patients with breast and ovarian cancer, regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} bone disease. TRAP expression was found in breast and ovarian cancers and malignant melanoma, while cervical cancer showed only minimal expression of TRAP. Expression of TRAP was absent in benign tissue or was much less marked than in the corresponding malignant <b>tissue.</b> <b>TRAP</b> expression was also demonstrated in cultured primary cancer cells and in commercially available cell lines. Conclusion Overexpression of TRAP was detected in the cells of various different tumors. TRAP might be useful as a marker of progression of malignant disease. It could also be a potential target for future cancer therapies. </p...|$|E

This study aimed {{to investigate whether}} TRAP was secreted differently from human obese versus lean adipose tissues and to identify the cellular source of adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>TRAP.</b> DESIGN: Subcutaneous adipose tissues obtained from healthy subjects. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for total (5 a+ 5 b) and cleaved TRAP (5 b) were used. TRAP secretion was determined in adipose tissue biopsies, and mRNA expression was studied in cell types isolated from the same. SUBJECTS: Results of 24 lean and 24 obese women (in vitro) and 8 subjects (in vivo) were compared. The main outcome measurements were TRAP expression and secretion in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: In-house total TRAP ELISA showed high sensitivity and a coefficient of variance of 11 %. Adipose secretion of total TRAP was linear in vitro with time and was evident in vivo. Total TRAP secretion in vitro was similar in lean and obese women expressed per unit weight of the adipose tissue but correlated positively with the number/size of adipocytes (P ≤ 0. 01) and with adipose secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin- 6 (P< 0. 01). TRAP 5 b was not secreted from the adipose tissue. ATMs displayed highest cellular expression of TRAP mRNA in adipose tissue cells derived from lean or obese women. CONCLUSIONS: TRAP is a novel human adipokine produced by macrophages and secreted from the subcutaneous adipose tissue in vivo and in vitro. Secretion {{is linked to the}} size and number of adipocytes, as well as to concomitant secretion of inflammatory mediators, suggesting that TRAP is involved in fat accumulation and adipose inflammation...|$|E

Methods The medical records {{of patients who}} were diagnosed with median raphe cysts between 2001 and 2010 were reviewed to document the clinical presentation and pathological findings of the cysts. Results Most patients were asymptomatic; however, 9 patients had inflammatory or infectious cysts that were tender or painful. Four patients who had cysts on the parameatus and distal prepuce had difficulty voiding. Hematuria and hematospermia were noted in 2 cases. Thirty-one cysts were lined with an urothelium-like epithelium, and a squamous epithelium lining was found in 3 cases. In 2 cases, a well-formed mucinous glandular structure was observed. The other 20 cysts consisted of mixed epithelia. After excision of the cysts under local or general anesthesia, an urethral fistula developed as a complication in only 1 case. Conclusions Median raphe cysts are benign lesions formed due to <b>tissue</b> <b>trapping</b> during the development of urethral folds.

40|$|Abstract The {{carcasses}} of semelparous Pacific salm-on (Oncorhynchus spp.) provide {{nutrients that}} enter aquatic ecosystems by various pathways, including direct consumption of tissue by fishes. Salmonids {{and other species}} frequently eat eggs and other tissues from dead salmon but the roles of vision and olfaction are unclear, as is the relative attraction to different tissues. Accordingly, we {{conducted a series of}} in situ experiments using minnow traps in two natural streams in Alaska to test the relative roles of chemo-sensory and visual cues in attraction of fishes to eggs from adult Pacific salmon, and then compared catch rates of traps baited with eggs, muscle, liver, and testis. Experiments indicated that chemical traces were necessary and sufficient to attract juvenile Dolly Varden (Sa lve l i nus ma lma), coho sa lmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and sculpins (Cottus spp.) into traps. Combining both sites, 70 salmonids and 19 sculpins were trapped using visual and chemical cues, and 53 and 21, respectively, for traps with only chemical cues. Traps with only the sight of eggs caught no salmonids and only 5 sculpins, comparable to empty control traps. In addition, eggs were mark-edly more attractive than the other <b>tissues,</b> <b>trapping</b> 68 % of the salmonids and 69 % of the sculpins, compared to 14 % and 15 % for muscle tissue, 12 % and 11 % for liver, and 6 % and 5 % for the testis. Visual cues undoubtedly play a role in egg consump-tion in streams, but these experiments indicated a very important role of chemical traces in attracting fish to the vicinity of the eggs, and selective attraction of eggs over other salmon tissues...|$|R

Because compartmentalization of IL- 5 is recognized, the anti-IL- 5 monoclonal antibody TRFK- 5 or its isotype control GL 113 were delivered selectively intranasally (i. n.) and/or intravenously (i. v.) before the prior i. n. challenge with 10 mug OVA in BALB/c and BP 2 "Biozzi" mice immunized according to optimized protocols with read-outs taken 24 h later. IL- 5 in the BALF was suppressed by i. n. TRFK- 5, whereas its production persisted in the serum. Conversely, i. v. TRFK- 5 suppressed IL- 5 in the serum but not in the BALF. IL- 5 was suppressed in conditioned medium from lung explants from mice treated with i. n. TRFK- 5, which did not affect the other Th 2 cytokines, IL- 4 and IL- 13. IL- 5 is thus present in the alveolar, pulmonary and circulatory compartments following an i. n. allergenic challenge. When specific anti-IL- 5 antibodies were delivered by the same i. n. route, BALF eosinophilia was markedly reduced, whereas BHR and lung eosinophil sequestration persisted totally or mostly, in both strains. The passage of eosinophils from lungs to alveoli depends on IL- 5 released into the BALF, but not into circulation, whereas their lung sequestration and BHR are mostly IL- 5 -independent. IL- 5 alone does not account for the complexities of BHR or of eosinophil <b>tissue</b> <b>trapping,</b> and lung-targeted immunobiologicals should be delivered into the appropriate compartment in order to assess the role of specific mediators in experimental airways/lung allergy...|$|R
40|$|Angiocentric glioma (AG) is a newly-classified, very rare, WHO grade I {{central nervous}} system (CNS) lesion, {{occurring}} usually in children and young adults. Only 52 patients with AG have been reported so far, {{making it one of}} the rarest neuropathological entities. Hereby we present two new cases of AG in young subjects with detailed neuropathological investigations and a neuroradiological picture along with a brief summary of all already published literature reports of this tumor. Histopathological examination of the resected tissue from both cases revealed similar changes characteristic of AG. The tumors were composed of spindle-like, elongated cells, forming characteristic pseudorosettes around vessels and diffusively infiltrating surrounding <b>tissue,</b> <b>trapping</b> neurons between tumor cells. Noticeably, some neoplastic cells encrusting vessels extended far beyond the main tumor mass. Hypothetically, this may be responsible for the recurrence of the tumor even in the case of apparently total excision. In immunohistochemistry, AG cells were glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin positive, also exhibiting a strikingly significant epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) dot-like staining pattern. In one of the cases, electron microscopy revealed ependymal differentiation features such as microvilli and cilia. Taken together, all these data strongly confirm a dual astroglial-ependymal nature of the tumor. Follow up corroborates benign character of this neoplasm. Both AGs reported here were immunonegative for the product of the mutated IDH- 1 gene what, according to our best knowledge, has never been reported so far. It may suggest that in their pathogenesis AGs differ from grade II astrocytomas, which in most cases harbor a mutation of IDH- 1. Noteworthy, neuroimaging in our cases was relatively characteristic but not conclusive, therefore biopsy (at least) is mandatory. A newly proposed so called “A-B-C” classification of long-term epilepsy-associated tumors (LEATs) places AG in a category named ANET.

Sediment samples were collected randomly with four replications. A lens <b>tissue</b> <b>trapping</b> method was applied to collect living benthic diatoms. Primary productivity was measured in-situ in the locations as production of carbon per unit area per unit time. It was determined by dissolved oxygen content measured by the bell jar method. Data were then analyzed using a biodiversity index (Shannon-Wiener index), ANOVA, regression and cluster multivariate analysis for b biodiversity. Totally, 86 benthic diatom species had been found and the benthic diatom community assemblage was dominated by Amphora coffeaeformis, Diploneis crabro, Diploneis smithi, Navicula elliptica, Pleurosigma sp., Stauropsis majuscula and Surirella gemma. Benthic diatom abundance was 8. 6750 x 104 to 18. 9626 x 104 cell/m 2, where the highest was found in Demak and the lowest was in Pemalang. Abundance of the diatom does not always have significant relation (P > 0. 05) to both inundation levels and mangrove density; however, this was more depended on location. The assemblage of benthic diatom community was more similar in Rembang and Pemalang compared to that in Demak, however the a biodiversity index tended to be higher in the lower mangrove density. The benthic micro-flora primary productivity was 120 to 342 mg C/m 2 /hour and had no significant relation (P > 0. 05) to abundance of benthic diatom.

40|$|AbstractTomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) is a bipartite {{member of}} the {{subgroup}} III Geminiviridae. Like all geminiviruses, TGMV replicates in the nucleus of susceptible cells by rolling circle replication (RCR). Double-stranded replicative form DNA generated during RCR serves as template for the transcription of viral genes by RNA polymerase II and the associated cellular transcription machinery. Previous studies in tobacco protoplasts andNicotiana benthamianaleaf discs {{have shown that the}} viralAL 2 gene product transactivates expression of the coat protein (CP) andBR 1 movement protein genes, and that activation occurs at the level of transcription. Because of its function and properties, we propose the name TrAP, transcriptional activator protein, for theAL 2 gene product. Using transgenes consisting of complete and truncated versions of theCPpromoter fused to the GUS reporter gene, we show in the studies presented here that TrAP is required forCPgene expression in both mesophyll and phloem <b>tissues.</b> Surprisingly, <b>TrAP</b> appears to induceCPexpression by different mechanisms in different cell types: it may activate theCPpromoter in mesophyll cells, and acts to derepress the promoter in phloem <b>tissue.</b> In addition, <b>TrAP</b> is clearly capable of inducing the expression of responsive chromosomal promoters and could, in principle, activate host genes.

Sweetpotato weevil infestation can reduce marketable root yield as well as reduce root quality by inducing production of bitter tasting sesquiterpines by the sweetpotato <b>tissue.</b> <b>Traps</b> baited with a male sweetpotato weevil lure, (Z) - 3 -dodecenyl (E) - 2 -butenoate, can be used for population monitoring, or even for population suppression if mass trapping is done using high doses of this lure. Weathering rates, though, have not been documented in Hawaii for the higher septa loadings (100 to 1000 μg [= 1. 0 mg]) that have been proposed for use in population suppression efforts through mass trapping. Here, we present comparative catch rates and weathering rates, along the Hamakua Coast of Hawaii island, of traps baited with septa loaded with 12 μg, 120 μg, or 1. 0 mg of male sweetpotato weevil lure. Traps baited with fresh 1. 0 mg male lure caught over 22 times as many weevils as traps baited with 12 μg lure over an initial one-week trapping period.

LPL heterozygotes with normal fasting TG (1. 3 – 1. 9 mmol/l) displayed increased ASP (101 – 137 % increase, P < 0. 05 – 0. 01) and delayed TG clearance after a fatload; glucose levels remained similar to controls. Hypertriglyceridemics with no known LPL mutation also had increased ASP levels (63 – 192 % increase, P < 0. 001). High-TG LPL heterozygotes were administered a fatload before and after fibrate treatment. The treatment reduced fasting and postprandial plasma ASP, TG, and FA levels without changing insulin or glucose levels. ASP enhances adipose <b>tissue</b> fatty-acid <b>trapping</b> following a meal; however in LPL deficiency, high ASP levels are coupled with delayed lipid clearance...|$|R
40|$|The {{high-throughput}} {{brain slice}} method is a precise and robust technique for estimating the overall uptake of drugs into brain tissue through {{determination of the}} unbound volume of distribution in the brain (Vu,brain; ml·g brain- 1). Vu,brain describes {{the relationship between the}} total drug concentration in the brain and the concentration of unbound drug in the brain interstitial fluid, regardless of blood–brain barrier function. The brain slice method is more physiologically based than the brain homogenate method with respect to the assessment of drug distribution in the brain because the cell-cell interactions, pH gradients and active transport systems are all conserved. The method provides information that is directly relevant to issues such as nonspecific binding to brain <b>tissue,</b> lysosomal <b>trapping,</b> and active uptake into the cells. For these reasons, the brain slice method is recommended for estimation of target-site pharmacokinetics in the early drug discovery process and fundamental pharmacological studies. This article provides a detailed protocol for the rat and mouse brain slice methods, with the aim of enabling simple, cost-effective profiling of compounds with diverse physicochemical properties. The procedure for assessing the viability of the brain slices after the 5  h incubation period is also described. The results are interpreted for a set of compounds covering a wide range of physicochemical properties and various pharmacological targets. Application of the method for evaluating the unbound intracellular-to-extracellular concentration ratio (Kp,uu,cell) and the unbound brain-to-plasma concentration ratio (Kp,uu,brain) is discussed...|$|R
5000|$|A median mandibular cyst {{is a type}} of cyst {{that occurs}} in the midline of the mandible, thought to be created by {{proliferation}} and cystic degeneration of resting epithelial tissue that is left trapped within the substance of the bone during embryologic fusion of the two halves of the mandible, along the plane of fusion later termed the symphysis menti. A ture median mandibular cyst would therefore be classified as a non-odontogenic, fissural cyst. The existence of this lesion as a unique clinical entity is controversial, and some reported cases may have represented misdiagnosed odontogenic cysts, [...] which are by far {{the most common type of}} intrabony cyst occurring in the jaws. It has also been suggested that the mandible develops as a bilobed proliferation of mesenchyme connected with a central isthmus. Therefore, it is unlikely that epithelial <b>tissue</b> would become <b>trapped</b> as there is no ectoderm separating the lobes in the first instance.|$|R
40|$|Objective: We report our {{experience}} – a case {{series with the}} Over the Scope Clip (OTSC), Bear claw, a novel and new tool for the endoscopic entrapment of tissue for closure of fistula and perforations. Design: Single-center. Setting: Tertiary referral academic gastroenterology unit and center for advanced therapeutic endoscopy. Patient: Case I – referred for endoscopic treatment for the closure of gastrocutaneous fistula (GC). Case II – referred for endoscopic treatment for the closure of colo-vaginal fistula. Case III – referred for endoscopic treatment for the closure of GC fistula. Intervention: The OTSC system was mounted {{on the tip of}} the scope and passed down {{to the level of the}} fistula. The targeted site of the fistula was grasped with the tissue anchoring tripod and pulled into the cap with concomitant scope channel suction. Once the <b>tissue</b> was <b>trapped</b> in the cap, the Bear claw was deployed. Main outcome measurements: NA. Results: All patients recovered. No complication or recurrence noted. Case I showed successful results with closure of the fistula. Case II fistula was not closed due to the cavity beneath the fistula probably abscess formation – which prevented the healing of the fistula site despite of the closure with OTSC. Case III fistula did not close successfully due to the larger diameter of the fistula which was greater than 1  cm. Conclusion: With several new devices being introduced, it is difficult to judge the implementation of one tool over the others. This device has shown promising results for fistula closure if used knowing the limitation of the product...|$|R

40|$|Focal {{resorption}} of bone at the bone-pannus interface {{is common}} in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) and can result in significant morbidity. However, the specific cellular and hormonal mechanisms involved in this process are not well established. We examined tissue sections from areas of bone erosion in patients with RA and JRA. Multinucleated cells (MNCs) were present in resorption lacunae in areas of calcified cartilage and in subchondral bone immediately adjacent to calcified cartilage, as previously described. mRNA for the calcitonin receptor (CTR) was localized to these MNCs in bone resorption lacunae, a finding that definitively identifies these cells as osteoclasts. These MNCs were also positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) mRNA and TRAP enzymatic activity. Occasional mononuclear cells on the bone surface were also CTR positive. Mononuclear cells and MNCs not on bone surfaces were CTR negative. The restriction of CTR-positive cells {{to the surface of}} mineralized tissues suggests that bone and/or calcified cartilage provide signals that are critical for the differentiation of hematopoietic osteoclast precursors to fully differentiated osteoclasts. Some MNCs and mononuclear cells off bone and within invading <b>tissues</b> were <b>TRAP</b> positive. These cells likely represent the precursors of the CTR-TRAP-positive cells on bone. Parathyroid hormone receptor mRNA was present in cells with the phenotypic appearance of osteoblasts, in close proximity to MNCs, and in occasional cells within pannus tissue, but not in the MNCs in bone resorption lacunae. These findings demonstrate that osteoclasts within the rheumatoid lesion do not express parathyroid hormone receptor. In conclusion, the resorbing cells in RA exhibit a definitive osteoclastic phenotype, suggesting that pharmacological agents that inhibit osteoclast recruitment or activity are rational targets for blocking focal bone erosion in patients with RA and JRA...|$|R
