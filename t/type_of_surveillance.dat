500|$|The Supreme Court {{decision}} in United States v. U.S. District Court (1972) left {{open the possibility}} for a foreign intelligence surveillance exception to the warrant clause. Three United States Courts of Appeals have recognized a foreign intelligence surveillance exception to the warrant clause, but tied it to certain requirements. The exception to the Fourth Amendment was formally recognized by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review in its 2008 [...] decision. The lower court held that, [...] "a foreign intelligence exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement exists when surveillance is conducted to obtain foreign intelligence for national security purposes and is directed against foreign powers or agents of foreign powers reasonably believed to be located outside the United States." [...] Despite the foregoing citation the Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures nonetheless apply to the contents of all communications, whatever the means, because, [...] "a person's private communications are akin to personal papers." [...] To protect the telecommunication carriers cooperating with the US government from legal action, the Congress passed a bill updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to permit this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>surveillance.</b>|$|E

Approval of a FISA application requires the court find probable cause that {{the target of the}} surveillance be a [...] "foreign power" [...] or an [...] "agent of a foreign power", and that the places at which surveillance is requested is used or will be used by that foreign power or its agent. In addition, the court must find that the proposed surveillance meet certain [...] "minimization requirements" [...] for information pertaining to U.S. persons. Depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>surveillance,</b> approved orders or extensions of orders may be active for 90 days, 120 days, or a year.|$|E

Throughout my presentation I will further elaborate on what <b>types</b> <b>of</b> technologies the border services use that threaten privacy rights. The first technology that I will talk about is the global identification card, the passport. The passport has been extracting more information from citizens’ over the years. This has become an increasing concern amongst citizens’ as their personal information is being viewed by border agencies. The second technology that I will address is the technology <b>of</b> <b>surveillance.</b> In the topic <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> I will elaborate on three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>surveillances</b> which are surveillance cameras, listening devices, and full body scanners. These <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> crosses the boundaries of citizens’ privacy. The third technology that I will propose during my presentation is the technology of the border officers. The border officers act like a technology because they can prohibit people from {{coming in and out}} of a country and can also use their authority to detain citizens at borders for prolonged periods. The underlying message from my essay is to shed light on how these technologies have stolen citizens’ personal information for their own purposes and how they have gone too far with extracting our information...|$|R

5000|$|Dataveillance is the {{practice}} of monitoring and collecting online data as well as metadata. The word is a portmanteau of data and surveillance. [...] Dataveillance {{is concerned with the}} continuous monitoring of users' communications and actions across various platforms. For instance, dataveillance refers to the monitoring of data resulting from credit card transactions, GPS coordinates, emails, social networks, etc. Using digital media often leaves traces of data and creates a digital footprint of our activity. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> is not often known and happens discreetly. Unlike sousveillance, where individuals willingly surveillance their activity, dataveillance is more discrete and unknown. Dataveillance may involve the surveillance of groups of individuals. There exist three types of dataveillance: personal dataveillance, mass dataveillance, and facilitiative mechanisms.|$|E

The National Council for Civil Liberties criticised the judge's finding that surveillance could be justified by a person's lawful political beliefs and called for stricter limits on surveillance.|$|E
