5|$|Maybe mid-year; {{safe to say}} {{towards the}} end {{but not at the}} end, maybe like eight months or {{something}} like that. Best <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> is we’re going to do it whenever we want to do it. There is no deadline right now, we don’t have any dates set, we don’t have the studio, we’re going to do the record ourselves. So we will literally go in and record it and it will be probably be done before we sign a contract.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the many}} {{deficiencies}} attending a university education there was, however, one good <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> {{and that was}} the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young man in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.|$|E

500|$|All {{reviews of}} the picture weren't so enthusiastic, however. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly graded the film a B-, saying that while the skating scenes are a blast, the film stumbles when it {{attempts}} {{to be too much}} for too many audiences.

Priya Elan of NME explained that [...] "the results are pretty much all quality" [...] {{and that some of}} the tracks are better than the original songs on Silent Alarm. Rockfeedback's Thomas Hannan stated, [...] "It's all very clever, but the most intelligent <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> is that it makes you think about the original in a completely altered way."

500|$|Loves of a Blonde {{sold out}} in theaters {{throughout}} Czechoslovakia, and its extraordinary success has been attributed, at least in part, to its {{being one of the}} first eastern European films to include an extended sex scene that involved nude performers. [...] The film was the recipient of the Order of Klement Gottwald, an award that recognized exemplary works [...] "for building of socialist homeland". Forman was later to say: [...] "The award from the first communist president of the land and a legendary boozer was more of an embarrassment than anything else. The only good <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> was the fat envelope that came with the ribbon. It contained 20 000 CZK (800 EUR), nearly a year's salary".|$|E

I think the best <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> is that it's playoff time, and adrenaline helps the most." [...] In the 7-game ALCS against the Indians he hit three more home runs, had 14 hits (tying the LCS record jointly held by Hideki Matsui and Albert Pujols since 2004), and scored 10 runs (bettering Matsui's 2004 ALCS record) while batting [...]500 (another new ALCS record, bettering Bob Boone's [...]455 in 1986) with a [...]576 OBP and a [...]929 slugging percentage.|$|E
500|$|Drake's {{shirt is}} always tucked {{into his pants}} on only one side, an {{attribute}} which commentators have labeled the [...] "half-tuck". The term, first coined by video game designer Tim Schafer, led to Naughty Dog altering Drake's appearance to have his shirt almost tucked in from the front, and half tucked in at the back, an inside joke Naughty Dog co-president Evan Wells labeled a [...] "three-quarters-tuck." [...] The half-tuck {{was part of a}} larger effort to ensure Drake's design was asymmetrical. Tim Schafer commented [...] "It was all super next-gen, but the most next-gen <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to me was Drake's shirt. Check it out: Somehow it's tucked in, and yet not tucked in, at the very same time. Of all the technical marvels contained in Uncharted, this was the one that really mystified me." ...|$|E

50|$|Whether {{the remark}} {{attributed}} to Half Yellow Face {{was made on}} the morning of June 25, 1876 through an interpreter or by sign language, two <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> are true. First, the remark, though possessing poetic power, probably made no impression on Custer who continued with his plan to divide his troops into separate units and attack the Sioux/Cheyenne encampment. Second the remark was remarkably prophetic for Custer and the five troops of cavalry who went with him.|$|R
500|$|A second {{version of}} the video (known as the Sugar Lumps version), which adds the Sugar Lumps—a satirical {{version of the}} Spice Girls played by Kathy Burke, Dawn French, Llewella Gideon, Lulu, and Jennifer Saunders—was filmed for the [...] "Red Nose Day" [...] of the 1997 Comic Relief, {{one of the two}} {{high-profile}} telethon events held in the United Kingdom. The video starts with the Sugar Lumps as schoolgirls dreaming of becoming Spice Girls, and ends with them joining the group on stage, while dancing and lip-synching the song. Halliwell commented about the shoot: [...] "The women were all really warm and funny and nice. The freakiest <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> was seeing Jennifer Saunders. She looked just like me and everyone said they thought she was me. It was alsolutely bizarre–the make-up, everything. It was scary–like, do I really do that?".|$|E
500|$|Describing {{himself as}} [...] "sort of a foodie", Selman {{has said that}} food is {{constantly}} on his mind and that he particularly likes reading food critic Jonathan Gold's reviews in LA Weekly. He told LA Weeklys Squid Ink food blog that he likes foodies, despite making fun of them in [...] "The Food Wife". He commented that on the show, he has often [...] "taken something that I love, found the one little weird, bad <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and harped on that", giving foodies as an example and writing: [...] "You can make fun of them for being pretentious or snobby or taking {{the fun out of}} eating. That you'd rather photograph something than taste it is a funny nuance of the phenomenon. That it's more about sticking your flag in something than actually enjoying it. We kind of make fun of foodies, but in real life we actually love them." ...|$|E
500|$|Philip Stead, {{writing in}} The Times Literary Supplement {{considered}} the novel to be [...] "a morbid {{version of that}} of Beauty and the Beast". The review noted that once Bond arrives on the scene to find Michel threatened by the two thugs, he [...] "solves [...] in his usual way. A great quantity of ammunition is expended, the zip-fastener is kept busy and the customary sexual consummation {{is associated with the}} kill." [...] Stead also considered that with the words of the police captain [...] "Mr. Fleming seems to have summarized in this character's remarks some of the recent strictures on James Bond's activities." [...] Vernon Scannell, as critic for The Listener, considered The Spy Who Loved Me to be [...] "as silly as it is unpleasant". What aggrieved him most, however, was that [...] "the worst <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> is that it really is so unremittingly, so grindingly boring." ...|$|E
5000|$|James Berardinelli, from reelviews.net, {{gave the}} film {{three and a}} half stars out of four. He stated, [...] "The {{strength}} of Maverick is the ease with which it switches from comedy to action, and back again....it's refreshing to find something that satisfies expectations." [...] Reviewing it for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of a possible four, writing: [...] "The first lighthearted, laugh-oriented family Western in a long time, and one of the nice <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> is, it doesn't feel the need to justify its existence. It acts like it's the most natural thing in the world to be a Western." ...|$|R

500|$|Amiga reviewers had {{a common}} grouse: the {{frequent}} disk swaps required were tedious. [...] Regardless, the game's tense atmospheregenerated by {{the combination of}} game mechanics, use of sounds, and artificial intelligenceprovided memorable moments to many reviewers. [...] As one of themSimon Clays of Amiga Computingput it, Space Hulk was [...] "a very difficult strategy-cum-3D dungeon-esque title with plenty of action and gripping play." [...] May said the game offered [...] "demented" [...] violence but was [...] "irresistibly exhiliarating when the action erupts in nonstop, heartpounding carnage." [...] A decade after the game's release, several reviewers mentioned Space Hulk as a Warhammer 40,000 video game worthy of praise. [...] Meer reflected on replaying the game fifteen years after its release, [...] "The panic and terror of facing 90 degrees away from your enemy, and knowing that you can't do a damn <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> before your lower intestine spills onto your feet, is still something pretty special." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore {{chose the}} album's name {{from a list}} of band, album and song names he kept. The Office of Strategic Influence was a highly secret {{organization}} set up three weeks after the September 11 attacks. Part of its mission was to spread misinformation and plant false news items in the media in order to [...] "influence {{the hearts and minds of}} the opposition." [...] After The New York Times ran a story on the Office in February 2002, it was forced to shut, although many of its operations were later transferred to the Information Operations Task Force. [...] "The funny <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> was the government and administration was saying it's so embarrassing that they had to name it the 'Office of Strategic Influence,' we couldn't just put it in a room in the Pentagon and name it whatever the room number is," [...] Moore said.

500|$|With Feliciano again up, Secretariat {{returned}} to the track on July 15 as the 6–5 favorite. He broke poorly, but then rushed past the field on the turn to win by six lengths. On July 31 in an allowance race at Saratoga, Feliciano was replaced by Ron Turcotte, the regular jockey for Meadow Stables. Turcotte had ridden the colt in several morning workouts, but had missed his first two starts while recovering from a fall. Secretariat's commanding win as the 2–5 favorite {{caught the attention of}} veteran sportswriter, Charles Hatton. He later reported, [...] "You carry an ideal around in your head, and boy, I thought, 'This is it.' I never saw perfection before. I absolutely could not fault him in any way.
