5|$|In August the UN {{also began}} using Korean civilians with A-frames as cargo {{carriers}} to move supplies {{up through the}} mountains <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines.</b> This method of transport proved both cheaper and more efficient than using pack animals. American units obtained the civilian carriers through arrangements with the ROK Army.

5|$|The {{division}} {{was moved to}} the Moscow Military District in October where it was assigned to the newly-forming 26th (Reserve) Army, Under the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. Some elements of the division entered active service in a highly dramatic manner, by first marching through Red Square in the famous October Revolution anniversary parade on November 7, then straight on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> just 10–15km away, being assigned to the 20th Army of the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of rest, the 20th Armoured Regiment {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> in early April.

5|$|By {{the time}} the battle ended, the United States had moved enough forces onto the Korean Peninsula to roughly equal the number of attacking North Korean forces. For its delaying actions in and around Taejon, the 24th Infantry Division was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. The {{division}} went into reserve status while it rested and rebuilt, and the first unit of the division back into action, the 19th Infantry Regiment, moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> of the Pusan Perimeter on 1 August.|$|E
5|$|Central to the UN {{defensive}} {{plan was}} to hold the port of Pusan, where vital ground supplies and reinforcements were arriving from Japan and the US. Pusan possessed airfields where US combat and cargo aircraft were streaming into Korea with more supplies. A system similar to the Red Ball Express in World War II was employed to get supplies from Pusan <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines.</b> Hundreds of ships arrived in Pusan each month, starting with 230 in July and increasing steadily thereafter. On July 24, the UN established its highest command under General of the Army Douglas MacArthur in Tokyo, Japan. North Korean forces in the meantime were suffering from overextended supply lines which severely reduced their fighting capacity.|$|E
5|$|During that month, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad {{indicated}} {{his intentions}} {{of going to}} war against Israel.

Sadat discussed {{the possibility of using}} oil as an economic weapon to pressure Western governments into adopting more pro-Arab policies. During the war, oil-producing Arab nations, primarily Libya and Saudi Arabia, initiated an oil embargo, and several sent token forces <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|E

5|$|For much of {{its first}} two years, the 70th Indiana {{performed}} reconnaissance duty and guarded railroads in Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1864, Harrison and his regiment joined William T.

He commanded the brigade at the battles of Resaca, Cassville, New Hope Church, Lost Mountain, Kennesaw Mountain, Marietta, Peachtree Creek and Atlanta. When Sherman's main force began its March to the Sea, Harrison's brigade {{was transferred to the}} District of Etowah and participated in the Battle of Nashville.|$|E

5|$|When the United States entered World War II, Kouma {{was trained}} as a tank crew member. He was {{assigned}} to the 9th Armored Division.

Its first mission was patrol duty in a quiet sector along the Luxembourg-German frontier. When the Germans launched their winter offensive, the 9th Armored Division was quickly involved in the Battle of the Bulge with next to no experience. The Division saw very heavy action at St. Vith, Echternach and Bastogne, its units, unprepared to counter the offensive, fighting in widely separated areas.|$|E

5|$|Early in the war, these {{aircraft}} {{were used}} primarily to conduct raids and gather intelligence on North Korean ground targets, focused on disrupting North Korean supply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines.</b> However, {{as soon as}} UN forces retreated to Pusan Perimeter following the Battle of Taejon, the Naval aircraft were immediately re purposed for close-air support and airstrikes against North Korean ground troops on the front. These missions were significantly more risky and the aircraft suffered much higher losses due to North Korean ground fire. On August 1, Sebille and his squadron moved to Ashiya Air Field and began conducting missions {{in support of the}} ground forces in Korea. By August 5, Sebille had accrued over 3,000 hours of flying time {{over the course of his}} career. During this time, the 67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron operated primarily out of Ashiya but also used airfields at Taegu and Pusan.|$|E
5|$|Fulton led the NZRB {{during the}} {{successful}} Battle of Messines in June 1917, but took ill {{immediately after the}} battle and was hospitalised for several days. Shortly after his return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> in late July, he was appointed commander of the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade Reserve Camp, better known as Sling Camp, for a three-month period. In his absence, the NZRB participated in the Battle of Passchendaele in October. Its morale already low because {{of the loss of}} two successive commanders, and lacking in preparation for the latter battle having been employed during the previous month in laying cables and constructing banking, the brigade's losses during Passchendaele were significant. Fulton returned to the brigade in November, and despite his time away, was awarded the Croix de Guerre in December 1917. He had also been mentioned in despatches twice during the year.|$|E

In August 1940, de Bourgoing agreed to serve as Vice-President of the newly formed Unified French Red Cross. In 1944, despite the cold winter, she travelled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> in the Vosges to encourage the 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division who were engaged in heavy battles with the Germans. When the war ended, she resumed her trips to Morocco, spending several months there each year. In 1946, de Bourgoing was not only appointed Directrice Générale de la Croix Rouge but was elevated to Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, the first woman to receive the honour. She was also awarded the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Ouissam Alaouite in recognition of her work in Morocco.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to reach a ceasefire, peacekeepers escorted Tshombe <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> where {{he was forced to}} agree that his own forces were attacking UN {{positions}} without provocation. He ordered his troops to cease firing but was ignored. Radio intercepts revealed to the UN that General Norbert Moke, the commander of the Katangese Gendarmerie, had ordered the Katangese Air Force to bomb the Élisabethville airport on the night of 29 December. With the failure to enact a ceasefire, Lieutenant General Dewan Prem Chand of India convinced Thant to authorise a strong, decisive offensive to pre-emptively eliminate Katangese forces. This brought relief to some of the UN peacekeepers, mindful that they now had justification to act forcefully against Katanga. Determined to avoid civilian casualties and widespread destruction, the secretary-general sent a wire to the UN Force Commander in the Congo to explain that napalm was to be prohibited from use in combat. Early on 28 December for unknown reasons, Tshombe quietly departed Élisabethville.|$|E
5|$|The division, now {{commanded}} by Major General George Price Hays, sailed for Italy in two parts, with the 86th Infantry and support leaving Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia on 11 December aboard the SS Argentina and arrived in Naples, Italy on 22 December. The 85th and 87th Infantry left Hampton Roads, Virginia on 4 January 1945 aboard the SS West Point arriving on 13 January 1945. By 6 January, its support units {{were preparing to}} head <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines.</b> It was attached to Major General Willis D. Crittenberger's IV Corps, part of the American Fifth Army, under Lieutenant General Lucian Truscott. By 8 January, the 86th Infantry had moved to Bagni di Lucca near Mount Belvedere in preparation for an offensive by the Fifth Army to capture the mountain along with surrounding high ground, which allowed the Axis to block advances to Po Valley.

5|$|The {{responsibility}} of the North Korean logistics was divided between the Ministry of National Defense (MND), led by Marshal Choe Yong Gun, and the NKPA Rear Service Department, commanded by General Choe Hong Kup. The MND was mainly responsible for railroad transportation and supply procurement, while the Rear Service Department was responsible for road transportation. The North Koreans relied on a logistical system which was very lean and substantially smaller than the United Nations' system. This logistics network was therefore capable of moving far fewer supplies, and this caused considerable difficulty for front line troops. Based on the efficient Soviet model, this ground-based network relied primarily on railroads to transport supplies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> while troops transported those items onto the individual units on foot, trucks, or carts. This second effort, though more versatile, was also a substantial disadvantage because it was less efficient and often too slow to follow the moving front-line units.|$|E
