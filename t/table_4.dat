25|$|Many {{studies have}} focused on diets that reduce {{calories}} via a low-carbohydrate (Atkins diet, Scarsdale diet, Zone diet) diet versus a low-fat diet (LEARN diet, Ornish diet). The Nurses' Health Study, an observational cohort study, found that low carbohydrate diets based on vegetable sources of fat and protein are associated with less coronary heart disease. The same study also found no correlation (with multivariate adjustment) between animal fat intake and coronary heart disease (<b>table</b> <b>4).</b> A long term study that monitored 43,396 Swedish women however suggests that a low carbohydrate-high protein diet, used on a regular basis and without consideration of the nature of carbohydrates or the source of proteins, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.|$|E

2500|$|Comparisons of {{antibody}} responses {{generated by}} natural (viral) infection, immunization with recombinant protein and immunization with pDNA are summarised in <b>Table</b> <b>4.</b> DNA-raised antibody responses rise {{much more slowly}} than when natural infection or recombinant protein immunization occurs. As many as 12 weeks {{may be required to}} reach peak titres in mice, although boosting can decrease the interval. This response is probably due to the low levels of antigen expressed over several weeks, which supports both primary and secondary phases of antibody response.

Also specific T-cells for middle envelop proteins antigens were developed. The immune response of the patients was not robust enough to control HBV infection ...|$|E
