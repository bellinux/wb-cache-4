40|$|This Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between Lockheed Marietta Energy Systems, Inc., and REMOTEC, Inc., {{explored}} {{methods of}} providing operator feedback for various work {{actions of the}} ANDROS Mk VI <b>teleoperated</b> <b>robot.</b> In a hazardous environment, an extremely heavy workload seriously degrades the productivity of <b>teleoperated</b> <b>robot</b> operators. This CRADA involved the addition of computer power to the robot along {{with a variety of}} sensors and encoders to provide information about the robot`s performance in and relationship to its environment. Software was developed to integrate the sensor and encoder information and provide control input to the robot. ANDROS Mk VI robots are presently used by numerous electric utilities to perform tasks in reactors where substantial exposure to radiation exists, as well as in a variety of other hazardous environments. Further, this platform has potential for use in a number of environmental restoration tasks, such as site survey and detection of hazardous waste materials. The addition of sensors and encoders serves to make the robot easier to manage and permits tasks to be done more safely and inexpensively (due to time saved in the completion of complex remote tasks). Prior research on the automation of mobile platforms with manipulators at Oak Ridge National Laboratory`s Center for Engineering Systems Advanced Research (CESAR, B&R code KC 0401030) Laboratory, a BES-supported facility, indicated that this type of enhancement is effective.

40|$|Abstract‚ÄîPerforming {{surgery on}} {{fast-moving}} heart structures while {{the heart is}} freely beating is next to impossible. Nevertheless, {{the ability to do}} this would greatly benefit patients. By controlling a <b>teleoperated</b> <b>robot</b> to continuously follow the heart‚Äôs motion, the heart can be made to appear stationary. The surgeon will then be able to operate on a seemingly stationary heart when in reality it is freely beating. The heart‚Äôs motion is measured from ultrasound images and thus involves a non-negligible delay due to image acquisition and processing, estimated to be 150 ms that, if not compensated for, can cause the teleoperated robot‚Äôs end-effector (i. e., the surgical tool) to collide with and puncture the heart. This research proposes the use of a Smith predictor to compensate for this time delay in calculating the reference position for the <b>teleoperated</b> <b>robot.</b> The results suggest that heart motion tracking is improved as the introduction of the Smith predictor significantly decreases the mean absolute error, which is the error in making the distance between the robot‚Äôs endeffector and the heart follow the surgeon‚Äôs motion, and the mean integrated square error.
