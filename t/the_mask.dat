5|$|The Haunted Mask is the {{eleventh}} book in Goosebumps, {{the series of}} children's horror fiction novels created and authored by R. L. Stine. The book follows Carly Beth, a girl who buys a Halloween mask from a store. After putting on <b>the</b> <b>mask,</b> she starts acting differently and discovers that <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> has become her face; she is unable to pull <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> off. R. L. Stine says he {{got the idea for}} the book from his son who was wearing a mask he had trouble getting off.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond {{of the idea of}} having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going down the sides of the legs. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for <b>the</b> <b>mask.</b> The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. <b>The</b> <b>mask</b> eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at Kini Nui, a great temple at the island's centre, Jaller and Takua {{are confronted}} by all six Rahkshi. The six Toa mount a united {{offensive}} and defeat five of them, but a surviving Rahkshi attacks Takua. Jaller sacrifices himself to protect Takua, and Jaller's final words prompt Takua to don <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> of Light: <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> transforms him into Takanuva, the Toa of Light. Defeating the final Rakhshi, he constructs a craft {{powered by the}} worm-like creatures inside the Rahkshi to guide him to Makuta. Traveling to his lair beneath Mata Nui, the two hold a Kohlii contest for the island's fate. At Takanuva's bidding, the Toa, Turaga and Matoran gather together in the chamber, and witness Takanuva merging with Makuta to form a single powerful being. With Takanuva's willpower dominant, the being raises a gate leading deeper beneath the island, through which the gathered people flee. The being also revives Jaller before the gate collapses on top of it. The Turaga proceed to awaken Mata Nui using <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> of Light, which in turn revives Takanuva. The film ends with Takanuva discovering , the Matoran's original home.|$|E

5|$|During the 1959-60 season, Plante wore a goaltender mask for {{the first}} time in a regular season game. Although Plante had used his mask in {{practice}} since 1956 after missing 13 games because of a sinusitis operation, head coach Toe Blake was afraid it would impair his vision and would not permit him to wear it during regulation play. However, on November 1, 1959, Plante's nose was broken when he was hit by a shot fired by Andy Bathgate three minutes into a game against the New York Rangers, and he was taken to the dressing room for stitches. When he returned, he was wearing the crude home-made goaltender mask that he had been using in practices. Blake was livid, but he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante refused to return to the goal unless he wore <b>the</b> <b>mask.</b> Blake agreed on the condition that Plante discard <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> when the cut healed. The Canadiens won the game 3–1. During the following days Plante refused to discard <b>the</b> <b>mask,</b> and as the Canadiens continued to win, Blake was less vocal about it. The unbeaten streak stretched to 18 games. Plante did not wear <b>the</b> <b>mask,</b> at Blake's request, against Detroit on March 8, 1960; the Canadiens lost 3–0, and <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> returned for good the next night. That year the Canadiens won their fifth straight Stanley Cup, which was Plante's last.|$|E

The Matoran, alongside the Toa and Turaga leaders, live in Element-themed regions of the island.

5|$|The {{script for}} Part 3 called for Jason {{to wear a}} mask to cover his face, having worn a bag over his head in Part 2; what no one {{knew at the time}} was that <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> chosen would become a {{trademark}} for the character, and one instantly recognizable in popular culture in the years to come. During production, Steve Miner called for a lighting check. None of the effects crew wanted to apply any make-up for the light check, so they decided to just throw a mask on Brooker. The film's 3D effects supervisor, Martin Jay Sadoff, was a hockey fan, and had a bag of hockey gear with him on the set. He pulled out a Detroit Red Wings goaltender mask for the test. Miner loved <b>the</b> <b>mask,</b> but it was too small. Using a substance called VacuForm, Doug White enlarged <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, Terry Ballard placed red triangles on <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> to give it a unique appearance. Holes were punched into <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> and the markings were altered, making it different from Sadoff's mask. There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different appliances and took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey mask is over the face, a simple head mask was created. This one-piece mask would slip on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.|$|E
2500|$|Four rungs on {{the side}} of <b>the</b> <b>masks,</b> above and below each ear, let <b>the</b> <b>masks</b> hang in {{suspension}} and indicate that <b>the</b> <b>masks</b> were suspended from a cord, though experts have disagreed on how they were worn. British Museum art historian William Fagg concluded that unlike the small brass pendant <b>masks</b> worn at <b>the</b> waist by modern kings, <b>the</b> ivory <b>mask</b> was likely worn around the neck. An 1830s drawing of a similar <b>mask</b> worn at <b>the</b> breast by a neighboring ruler confirms Fagg's theory. Based on the position of the rungs, Metropolitan curator Alisa LaGamma also affirmed the theory. Benin specialist and anthropologist Paula Ben-Amos, however, wrote that <b>the</b> <b>masks</b> were worn on the waist as pendants during the Ugie Iyoba and Emobo ceremonies. <b>The</b> hollow <b>masks</b> likely served as amuletic containers.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{efficient}} <b>masking</b> method for <b>the</b> block cipher SEED that is standardized in Korea. The nonlinear parts of SEED consist of two S-boxes and modular additions. However, <b>the</b> <b>masked</b> version of these nonlinear parts requires excessive RAM usage {{and a large}} number of operations. Protecting SEED by <b>the</b> general <b>masking</b> method requires 512 bytes of RAM corresponding to masked S-boxes {{and a large number}} of operations corresponding to <b>the</b> <b>masked</b> addition. This paper proposes a new-style masked S-box which can reduce the amount of operations of <b>the</b> <b>masking</b> addition process as well as the RAM usage. <b>The</b> proposed <b>masked</b> SEED, equipped with <b>the</b> new-style <b>masked</b> S-box, reduces <b>the</b> RAM requirements to 288 bytes, and it also reduces the processing time by 38 % compared with <b>the</b> <b>masked</b> SEED using <b>the</b> general <b>masked</b> S-box. <b>The</b> proposed method also applies to other block ciphers with the same nonlinear operations...|$|R

Filming resumed in Tlaxcala, three hours east of Mexico City, where the production crew constructed the Montero hacienda and town set pieces. Sony sent David Foster to join the project as a producer to help fill the void left by Steven Spielberg, Walter F. Parkes, and Laurie MacDonald, who were busy running DreamWorks. Foster and David S. Ward, who went uncredited, re-wrote some scenes; the troubled production caused <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> of Zorro to go $10 million over its budget. In December, the producers were frustrated by customs agents when some props and other items, including Zorro's plastic sword, were held for nine days.
