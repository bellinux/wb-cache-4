The medical examiner testified that Jeff had a significant amount of cocaine in his body the night he died - so much so that Jeff's body had not metabolized all the cocaine. The cocaine evidence supported the defense's assertion that Jeff was intoxicated the night of his death, when he came home from a boxing class and punched his son. Jeff also had several knife wounds on his hands, forearms, back, and the backs of his legs, indicating defensive wounds inconsistent with being <b>tied</b> to a <b>bed.</b>|$|R

It is estimated that around 250,000 Australian-born non-Indigenous children were removed from their mothers from the 1930s to 1982 in what was widely seen by {{society as a whole}} at the time as a positive thing for both the mothers and the children.
