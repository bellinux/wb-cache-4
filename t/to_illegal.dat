5|$|About 100 tonnes of {{dysprosium}} {{are produced}} worldwide each year, with 99% of that total produced in China. Dysprosium prices have climbed nearly twentyfold, from $7 per pound in 2003, to $130 a pound in late 2010. The price increased to $1,400/kg in 2011 but fell to $240 in 2015, largely due <b>to</b> <b>illegal</b> production in China which circumvented government restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Groups of {{wildebeest}} {{females and}} young {{live in the}} small areas established by the male. When groups of wildebeest join together, the female to male ratio is higher because the females choose {{to move to the}} areas held by a smaller number of males. This female-dominated sex ratio may be due <b>to</b> <b>illegal</b> hunting and human disturbance, with higher male mortality having been attributed to hunting.|$|E

5|$|In the United States and the European Union, {{since the}} early 1990s {{regulations}} {{have been in place}} that are designed to prevent shellfish from contaminated waters entering the food chain. This has meant that there is sometimes a shortage of regulated shellfish, with consequent higher prices. This has led <b>to</b> <b>illegal</b> harvesting and sale of shellfish on the black market, which can be a health hazard.|$|E
5|$|Upon taking office, Gillibrand {{joined the}} Blue Dog Coalition, {{a group of}} {{moderate}} to conservative Democrats. She was noted for voting against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, citing concerns about insufficient oversight and excessive earmarks. Gillibrand opposed New York plans to issue driver's licenses <b>to</b> <b>illegal</b> immigrants, and {{voted in favor of}} legislation withholding federal funds from immigrant sanctuary cities.|$|E
5|$|As a cosmopolitan, mercantile city Trieste was a {{probable}} hub of illicit trade, and Francesco {{was forced to}} leave after he killed Josephus Steffani on July 31, 1778. Although Steffani's death is commonly attributed to a duel, given their acquaintanceship (both worked at a criminal court) it may have been related <b>to</b> <b>illegal</b> activity. Francesco's name and those of four sailors soon became linked to the murder. Convicted in absentia, the fugitive remained in touch with his family. Francesco went to Barcelona, reportedly learning Spanish there. By 1784 he had settled in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, a harbor town in the municipality of San Germán, where he was accepted by the local aristocracy with the Spanish honorific Don ("of noble origin"). Francesco's name was Hispanicized to Francisco Cofresí, which was easier for his neighbors to pronounce. Since he was linked <b>to</b> <b>illegal</b> commerce in his homeland, he probably relocated to Cabo Rojo for strategic reasons; its harbor was far from San Juan, the capital. Francisco soon met María Germana Ramírez de Arellano, and they married. His wife was born to Clemente Ramírez de Arellano y del Toro, a noble and first cousin of town founder Nicolás Ramírez de Arellano. Her family, descended from the aristocracy of Navarre, owned a significant amount of land in Cabo Rojo. After their marriage the couple settled in El Tujao (or El Tujado), near the coast. Francisco's father Giovanni died in 1789, and a petition pardoning him for Steffani's murder a decade before was granted two years later (enabling him to return to Trieste). However, no evidence exists that Francisco ever returned to the city.|$|E

McCain argued Prop 200 would be overly expensive to execute, {{that it would}} be ineffectual, and that immigration regulation falls only under the purview of the federal government.|$|R

His supporters have lauded him {{as a champion of}} indigenous rights, anti-imperialism, and environmentalism. Alternately, a number of leftist, indigenous, and environmentalist critics have accused him of failing to live up to many of his espoused values, while right-wing opponents have accused him of being excessively radical and authoritarian and claimed that his defence of coca contributes <b>to</b> <b>illegal</b> cocaine production.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October Welensky was soundly {{defeated}} by his RF opponent, with 633 votes to Dupont's 1079. In December he resigned {{the leadership of}} his party. When the RF declared unilateral independence on 11 November 1965, Welensky was upset at the constitutional break with Britain. He believed that Rhodesia was entitled to her independence, and disagreed with the British government's demand for 'no independence before majority rule', but was opposed <b>to</b> <b>illegal</b> action.|$|E
5|$|On May 10 Daniels {{signed into}} law two {{immigration}} bills; one denying in-state tuition prices <b>to</b> <b>illegal</b> immigrants and another creating fines for employers that employed illegal immigrants. Several protestors, at least five of whom were illegal immigrants, were arrested while protesting the law at the statehouse when they broke into Daniels' office after being denied a meeting. Student leaders called for their release, while some state legislators called for their deportation.|$|E

5|$|Sumatran {{rhinoceroses}} {{were once}} quite numerous throughout Southeast Asia. Fewer than 100 individuals are now estimated to remain. The species is classed as critically endangered (primarily due <b>to</b> <b>illegal</b> poaching) while the last survey in 2008 estimated that around 250 individuals survived. From the early 1990s, the population decline {{was estimated at}} more than 50% per decade, and the small, scattered populations now face high risks of inbreeding depression. Most remaining habitat is in relatively inaccessible mountainous areas of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} gangsters in Bintulu was first raised in 2007 by {{the member of}} {{parliament}} (MP) for Bintulu. The gangsters may have run businesses related <b>to</b> <b>illegal</b> logging, controlling the prices of diesel, eggs, fertiliser and gas cylinders. Bintulu police have been cracking down on gangster activities in the town. Unscrupulous businessmen who seek cheap labour have caused {{a rise in the}} number of illegal immigrants in Bintulu. The number may have reached 50,000 in 2009. Bintulu immigration department has performed several operations to deport illegal immigrants back to their home country.|$|E
5|$|The three circulars list {{various types}} of cost or expense item (such as travel expense, {{maintenance}} expense, payroll salaries, lobbying costs, purchase of materials, payment of utility bills, etc.), and establishes whether each is either allowable or unallowable. Allowable costs are those the federal government determines permissible for federal assistance. Unallowable costs are those the government prohibits incurring for federal assistance. Certain cost items are considered universally unallowable, such as cost related <b>to</b> <b>illegal</b> activities and lobbying costs, but others may be considered unallowable for a type of recipient while being allowable for another type of recipient. As a general rule, any assistance used inappropriately, such as incurring unallowable costs, requires reimbursement to the federal government.|$|E

5|$|There are varying {{interpretations of}} the {{original}} intent of Congress and of the ratifying states, based on statements made during the congressional debate over the amendment, {{as well as the}} customs and understandings prevalent at that time. Some of the major issues that have arisen about this clause are {{the extent to which it}} included Native Americans, its coverage of non-citizens legally present in the United States when they have a child, whether the clause allows revocation of citizenship, and whether the clause applies <b>to</b> <b>illegal</b> immigrants.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, access <b>to</b> <b>illegal</b> content (such {{as child}} pornography) was {{strictly}} self-regulated by individual internet service providers. This began when BT Group introduced Cleanfeed, a server-side filtering system which uses {{data obtained from}} the Internet Watch Foundation. The IWF is a Quango organisation that operates a website where users can report web pages containing illegal or dubious content {{to be added to}} their blacklists. This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the Protection of Children Act. British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Bevin {{criticized the}} Affordable Care Act {{and called for}} {{repealing}} it in its entirety. His proposed alternatives included allowing insurance providers to compete across state lines, capping damages awarded for pain and suffering, allowing individuals to purchase health insurance with pre-tax earnings, and providing federal block grants to states {{to allow them to}} cover individuals with pre-existing conditions. He opposed tax increases and the allocation of federal earmarks. He called for massive spending cuts in the federal bureaucracy, specifically the Department of Education and the Veterans Administration, and for reforming eligibility requirements for entitlement programs, including raising age requirements, imposing means tests, and ending federal benefits <b>to</b> <b>illegal</b> immigrants. He opposed U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War and the disbursement of foreign aid to countries that deny basic freedoms to their citizens or are guilty of human rights violations. He opposed federal agribusiness subsidies and warantless federal surveillance and called for simplifying the child adoption process. Endorsed by Gun Owners of America, he pledged to resist any restrictions on the types of guns or ammunition that citizens could purchase. A supporter of congressional term limits, Bevin signed a pledge authored by the non-profit U.S. Term Limits stating that, if elected, he would co-sponsor and vote for a bill restricting individuals to three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and two terms in the U.S. Senate.|$|E
