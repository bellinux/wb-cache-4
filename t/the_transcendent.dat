5|$|Langdon Brown Gilkey {{explained}} religious {{language and}} experience in terms of symbolism, identifying three characteristic features of religious symbolism which distinguish it from other language use. Firstly, religious symbolism has a double focus, referring both to something empirical and to something transcendent; Gilkey argued that the empirical manifestation points towards <b>the</b> <b>transcendent</b> being. Secondly, he believed that religious symbolism concerns fundamental questions of life, involving issues important to an individual or community. Finally, he argued that religious symbols provide standards by which life should be lived.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole point}} is that we are the song. The self is coming from a state of pure awareness, from the state of being. All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the {{physical}} world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and about the quality of <b>the</b> <b>transcendent.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{worship of}} Krishna {{is part of}} Vaishnavism, a major {{tradition}} within Hinduism. Krishna is considered a full avatar of Vishnu, or one with Vishnu himself. However, the exact relationship between Krishna and Vishnu is complex and diverse, with Krishna sometimes considered an independent deity and supreme. Vaishnavas accept many incarnations of Vishnu, but Krishna is particularly important. Their theologies are generally centered either on Vishnu or an avatar such as Krishna as supreme. The terms Krishnaism and Vishnuism have sometimes been used to distinguish the two, the former implying that Krishna is <b>the</b> <b>transcendent</b> Supreme Being.|$|E

5|$|Often {{categorized}} as a rationalist philosopher, Wollstonecraft demonstrates {{her commitment to}} and appreciation of feeling in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. She argues that subjective experiences, such as <b>the</b> <b>transcendent</b> emotions prompted by the sublime and the beautiful, possess a value equal to the objective truths discovered through reason. In Wollstonecraft's earlier works, reason was paramount, because it allowed access to universal truths. In Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, however, reason serves {{as a tool for}} reflection, mediating between the sensual experiences of the world and an abstract notion of truth (not necessarily universal truth). Maturation is not only the acquisition of reason—the view Wollstonecraft had adopted in Original Stories from Real Life (1788)—but also an understanding of when and how to trust one's emotions.|$|E

25|$|Künneth {{believed}} that although Bultmann was correct that empirical evidence could never decide {{the matter of}} the Resurrection (an event which was the Ur-Wunder of God, the prime miracle), and that Bultmann was also correct that saying so would destroy <b>the</b> <b>transcendent</b> content of the Ur-Wunder, still Bultmann had destroyed the Gospel by implying that Christ's victory over our time world of death and sin was a purely mythical one, with no implications for sinful creatures trapped in an immanent world.|$|E
25|$|By {{the twentieth}} century, Buddhism had {{penetrated}} {{deeply into the}} culture of Mongolia, and the populace willingly supported the lamas and the monasteries. Foreign observers usually had a negative opinion of Mongolian monks, condemning them as lazy, ignorant, corrupt, and debauched, but the Mongolian people did not concur. Ordinary Mongolians apparently combined a cynical and realistic anticlericalism, sensitive to the faults and the human fallibility of individual monks or groups of monks, with a deep and unwavering concern for <b>the</b> <b>transcendent</b> values of the church.|$|E

25|$|In {{classical}} theism, God {{is characterized}} as the metaphysically ultimate being (the first, timeless, absolutely simple and sovereign being, who is {{devoid of any}} anthropomorphic qualities), in distinction to other conceptions such as theistic personalism, open theism, and process theism. Classical theists {{do not believe that}} God can be completely defined. They believe it would contradict <b>the</b> <b>transcendent</b> nature of God for mere humans to define him. Robert Barron explains by analogy that it seems impossible for a two-dimensional object to conceive of three-dimensional humans.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{have often}} noted that Updike imbued {{language}} {{itself with a}} kind of faith in its efficacy, and that his tendency to construct narratives spanning many years and books—the Rabbit series, the Henry Bech series, Eastwick, the Maples stories—demonstrates a similar faith in <b>the</b> <b>transcendent</b> power of fiction and language. Updike's novels often act as dialectical theological debates between the book itself and the reader, the novel endowed with theological beliefs meant to challenge the reader as the plot runs its course. Rabbit Angstrom himself acts as a Kierkegaardian Knight of Faith.|$|E

25|$|Two memoirs by Fuchs (Crelle, 1866, 1868), {{inspired}} a novel approach, subsequently elaborated by Thomé and Frobenius. Collet {{was a prominent}} contributor beginning in 1869, although his method for integrating a non-linear system was communicated to Bertrand in 1868. Clebsch (1873) attacked the theory along lines parallel to those followed in his theory of Abelian integrals. As the latter can be classified according to {{the properties of the}} fundamental curve that remains unchanged under a rational transformation, so Clebsch proposed to classify <b>the</b> <b>transcendent</b> functions defined by the differential equations according to the invariant properties of the corresponding surfaces f = 0 under rational one-to-one transformations.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{proceeding}} by tenet #1 in Answer to Job, Jung interprets Yahweh as an archaic {{form of the}} self, Job as the ego, and Satan as {{the principle}} of individuation. Jung interprets {{the evolution of the}} god-image portrayed in the Old and New Testaments as a process of psychological development: In the Book of Job, the archaic self is prompted to develop toward consciousness by the more conscious ego, a process attended by dreams and prophesies (e.g. the Old Testament prophets). The self enters ego-consciousness (the incarnation of God in Jesus of Nazareth), followed by the emergence of <b>the</b> <b>transcendent</b> function (when the Holy Ghost comes to the disciples at Pentecost).|$|E
25|$|Thus Tillich dismisses a literalistic Biblicism. Instead of {{rejecting the}} notion of {{personal}} God, however, Tillich {{sees it as a}} symbol that points directly to the Ground of Being. Since the Ground of Being ontologically precedes reason, it cannot be comprehended since comprehension presupposes the subject–object dichotomy. Tillich disagreed with any literal philosophical and religious statements that can be made about God. Such literal statements attempt to define God and lead not only to anthropomorphism but also to a philosophical mistake that Immanuel Kant warned against, that setting limits against <b>the</b> <b>transcendent</b> inevitably leads to contradictions. Any statements about God are simply symbolic, but these symbols are sacred {{in the sense that they}} function to participate or point to the Ground of Being. Tillich insists that anyone who participates in these symbols is empowered by the Power of Being, which overcomes and conquers nonbeing and meaninglessness.|$|E

Depending on the player's choice, The Nameless One either slays his mortality or convinces it to rejoin with him; either option finally ends his immortality and allows him to die. In the game's final scene, The Nameless One awakens near a battleground of the eternal Blood War between demons and devils; he picks up a mace and walks toward the conflict.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We present transformations {{relating}} <b>the</b> third <b>transcendent</b> of Painlevé with {{parameter sets}} {{located at the}} corners of the Weyl chamber for the symmetry group of the system, the affine Weyl group of the root system B (1) 2, to those at the origin. This transformation entails a scaling of the independent variable, and implies additive identities for the canonical Hamiltonians and product identities for the τ-functions with these parameter sets. A curious anomaly has existed in the theory of <b>the</b> Painlevé <b>transcendents</b> for many years, for almost a century in fact. This anomaly is the existence of a particular transformation for <b>the</b> second Painlevé <b>transcendent</b> q(t; α + 1 / 2) which has no known analogue for any of <b>the</b> other <b>transcendents.</b> One recalls <b>the</b> second Painlevé <b>transcendent</b> q = q(t; α + 1 / 2) is by definition a solution of the PII differential equation (1) d 2 q dt 2 = 2 q 3 + tq + α, with parameter α ∈ C.
