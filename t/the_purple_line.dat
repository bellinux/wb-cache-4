25|$|The {{original}} routing of <b>the</b> <b>Purple</b> <b>Line</b> Express is clockwise {{around the}} Inner Loop track via Lake-Wabash-Van Buren-Wells, making all Loop stops {{before returning to}} Merchandise Mart and making all stops northbound to Linden. Beginning April 2, 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Purple</b> <b>Line</b> Express was rerouted onto the Outer Loop track along with the Brown Line due to the construction at the Belmont and Fullerton stations (see below). Prior to this, Purple Line Express trains were occasionally diverted to the Outer Loop track {{in the event of}} emergencies or signal problems in the Loop. On December 4, 2008, the CTA announced that <b>the</b> <b>Purple</b> <b>Line</b> Express would return to the original Inner Loop routing on December 29.|$|E
25|$|During the 2000s, LA Metro has {{developed}} {{plans to return}} rail transit to Santa Monica, which was gone after {{the dismantling of the}} Pacific Electric Railway during the 1960s. It {{has developed}} two plans, including the Metro Expo Line and Metro Purple Line both which would extend into Santa Monica. <b>The</b> <b>Purple</b> <b>Line</b> was originally to be extended into Santa Monica, but was stopped due to legislative action. However, Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman, one of those who opposed the Purple Line's extension, has recently reconsidered extending <b>the</b> <b>Purple</b> <b>Line</b> into Santa Monica. The proposal to extend <b>the</b> <b>Purple</b> <b>Line</b> has been described colloquially as the Subway to the Sea. It is estimated that if successful, both lines will be in service by the late 2010s.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Purple</b> <b>Line</b> is {{operated}} with the Bombardier-built 5000-series railcars. Until late May 2014, the 2400-series cars were also {{assigned to the}} line; for the entire 2000s and early 2010s, <b>the</b> <b>Purple</b> <b>Line</b> fleet consisted entirely, or nearly entirely of 2400-series cars. In spring 2007, small numbers of Morrison-Knudsen-built 3200-series railcars were transferred to the line, replacing the 2600-series railcars transferred to other lines, the 3200-series cars have since been returned to their original line assignments. The 2600-series cars were officially assigned to the line until early January 2013 when they were transferred to the Red and Blue Lines. However, beginning in October 2013, CTA has started to reassign the 2600-series cars back to the line as they get displaced by the new Bombardier-built 5000-series cars on the Red Line. Beginning in April 2014, CTA has started to assign some Bombardier-built 5000-series cars to the line. On May 21, 2014, the last 2400-series cars were removed from service from the line. The 2600-series cars were removed from service from the line on March 21, 2015. <b>The</b> <b>Purple</b> <b>Line</b> run with six cars during weekday rush hours and four cars at other times on weekdays and all day on weekends. Occasionally, <b>the</b> <b>Purple</b> <b>Line</b> borrows cars from the Red Line when short on cars.|$|E
