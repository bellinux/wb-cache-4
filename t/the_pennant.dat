5|$|Each season, one American League (AL) team wins <b>the</b> <b>pennant,</b> {{signifying}} {{that they}} are the league's champion and have the right to play in the World Series against the champion of the National League. <b>The</b> <b>pennant</b> was presented to the team with the best win–loss record each year through the 1968 season, after which the American League Championship Series (ALCS) was introduced to decide <b>the</b> <b>pennant</b> winner. The first modern World Series was played in 1903 and, after a hiatus in 1904, has taken place every season except 1994, when a players' strike forced the cancellation of the postseason. The current American League pennant holders are the Houston Astros who won in October 2017.|$|E
5|$|Hornsby did {{not become}} a manager or coach again until 1950, when he was hired to manage the Texas League's Beaumont Roughnecks. Beaumont won <b>the</b> <b>pennant,</b> but they were swept {{in the first round}} of the playoffs by the San Antonio Missions. The next year, in 1951, Hornsby managed the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League. Under Hornsby's leadership, the Rainiers won <b>the</b> <b>pennant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both the Dodgers and Braves {{finished}} the regularly scheduled 154-game season tied with records of 86–68, forcing a tie-breaker to decide <b>the</b> <b>pennant</b> winner. The two teams' managers flipped a coin to decide home field advantage and Dodgers' manager Walt Alston won. The Dodgers opted {{to play the}} second and third (if necessary) games at home, choosing to play Game 1 in Milwaukee. The tie-breaker was scheduled for the 28th, 29th, and the 30th if necessary, which required moving the start of the World Series from September 30 to October 1. The Giants' falling out of <b>the</b> <b>pennant</b> race avoided a potentially disruptive situation involving their home field. Candlestick Park was under construction during the 1959 season and the Giants would not begin play there until 1960. However, Giants vice president Chub Feeney had said earlier in the season that if the Giants won <b>the</b> <b>pennant</b> they would play their World Series home games in Candlestick. Several potential problems were suggested with this move including a lack of seating, lack of toilet facilities, and insufficient access roads to the stadium.|$|E

50|$|In 1890 the Reds won <b>the</b> Players' League <b>pennant</b> {{when they}} {{finished}} first ahead of the New York Giants, and then won <b>the</b> American Association <b>pennant</b> {{when they finished}} first ahead of the St. Louis Browns (now the Cardinals). The Boston Reds are one of two major league teams to win back-to-back pennants spanning two different leagues. The Brooklyn Dodgers did it also, winning <b>the</b> AA <b>pennant</b> in 1889 and <b>the</b> NL <b>pennant</b> in 1890.|$|R
5|$|For most of {{the history}} of the National League (94 years), <b>the</b> <b>pennant</b> was {{presented}} to the team with the best win–loss record at the end of the season. The first modern World Series was played in 1903, and after a hiatus in 1904, continued until 1994, when a players' strike forced the cancellation of the postseason, and resumed in 1995. In 1969, the league split into two divisions, and the teams with the best records in each division played one another in the NLCS to determine <b>the</b> <b>pennant</b> winner. The format of the NLCS was changed from a best-of-five to a best-of-seven format for the 1985 postseason. In 1995, an additional playoff series was added when Major League Baseball restructured the two divisions in each league into three. , the winners of the Eastern, Central, and Western Divisions, as well as one wild card team, play in the National League Division Series, a best-of-five playoff to determine the opponents who will play for <b>the</b> <b>pennant.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Cubs, led by Tinker, Evers, and Chance, won the National League pennant in 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1910. In 1908, the Cubs {{clinched}} <b>the</b> <b>pennant</b> after {{defeating the}} Giants {{in part due}} to Merkle's Boner. In the Merkle game, Tinker hit a home run off Christy Mathewson, and Evers alerted umpire Hank O'Day to Merkle's baserunning gaffe. In the replay of the Merkle game, Tinker hit a triple off Mathewson that started the rally that gave the Cubs the victory, clinching <b>the</b> <b>pennant.</b>|$|E
5|$|In early September 1926, {{thousands}} of Cleveland fans, confident that their Indians would win <b>the</b> <b>pennant</b> {{even when they}} trailed the Yankees by six games, made World Series ticket reservations. By September 23, the Indians were only two games behind New York, but then lost three of their final four games to finish the season three games behind.|$|E
50|$|During the 1948 Major League Baseball season, the Boston Braves won <b>the</b> NL <b>pennant</b> and <b>the</b> Cleveland Indians won a 1-game playoff {{against the}} Boston Red Sox to take <b>the</b> AL <b>pennant.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> gin <b>pennant</b> {{appeared}} {{at least as}} early as the 1940s, and possibly long before. Flying <b>the</b> gin <b>pennant</b> was an invitation (generally aimed at officers) to come aboard for a (free) drink in the ship's wardroom. (Consequently, junior officers would sometimes compete and conspire to fly <b>the</b> gin <b>pennant</b> aboard other ships.) Gin pennants likely originated in, and remain in use today, in the Commonwealth navies. http://web.archive.org/web/20111009065114/http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/halifax/2/2-s_eng.asp?category=229&title=1961. https://books.google.ca/books?id=NBPeHLc5AzcC&lpg=PA165&ots=tBNAqO3oE1&dq=gin%20pennant&pg=PA65#v=onepage&q&f=false ...|$|R

Barrow and Huggins had rebuilt the team and {{surrounded}} the veteran core with good young players like Tony Lazzeri and Lou Gehrig, but the Yankees were not expected to win <b>the</b> <b>pennant.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{finished}} the 1946 regular season tied {{for first place}} in the National League with the Brooklyn Dodgers. However, the Cardinals claimed <b>the</b> <b>pennant</b> by winning the first two games in a best-of-three playoff series.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pennants</b> were {{a family}} of Welsh gentry from the parish of Whitford, Flintshire, who had built up a modest estate at Bychton by the seventeenth century. In 1724 Thomas' father, David <b>Pennant,</b> {{inherited}} <b>the</b> neighbouring Downing estate from a cousin, considerably augmenting the family's fortune. Downing Hall, where Thomas {{was born in the}} 'yellow room', became <b>the</b> main <b>Pennant</b> residence. This house had been built in 1600 and the front and main entrance were set back between two forward facing wings. By <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>Pennants</b> moved there it {{was in a state of}} disrepair and many alterations were set in hand. It had a number of fine rooms including a well-stocked library and a smoking room [...] "most antiquely furnished with ancient carvings, and the horns of all the European beasts of chase". The grounds were also very overgrown and much effort was put into their improvement and the creation of paths, vistas and pleasure gardens.|$|R

5|$|The Yankees {{finished}} 79–75 in 1959, {{in third}} place, their worst record since 1925, as the White Sox, managed by Lopez, won <b>the</b> <b>pennant.</b> There was considerable criticism of Stengel, who {{was viewed as}} too old and {{out of touch with}} the players.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pennant</b> race {{continued}} {{between the}} three teams throughout the entire season. On September 25, after playing 147 games, with seven games left to play, all three teams had a record of 91–56. After each team played four more games, the Indians were up two games, meaning the Yankees and Red Sox had to win their games on September 30 to stay in <b>the</b> <b>pennant</b> race. They did, and the month of October opened up with both teams 1.5 games behind the Indians. The Indians' last series was a three-game stand against the Tigers, while the Red Sox and Yankees had a two-game series against each other.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-known}} {{variant of}} the sun disc design is the sun disc with 16 red rays in a Siemens star formation, which was also historically used by Japan's military, particularly the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy. The ensign, known in Japanese as the , was first adopted as the War flag on May 15, 1870, and was used {{until the end of}} World WarII in 1945. It was re-adopted on June 30, 1954, and is now used as the war flag and naval ensign of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). In Korea and China, this flag still carries a negative connotation. The JMSDF also employs the use of a masthead pennant. First adopted in 1914 and readopted in 1965, the masthead pennant contains a simplified version of the naval ensign at the hoist end, with the rest of <b>the</b> <b>pennant</b> colored white. The ratio of <b>the</b> <b>pennant</b> is between 1:40 and 1:90.|$|E

In <b>the</b> <b>Pennant</b> season for South Melbourne, Armstrong scored 665runs {{at an average of}} 95; this included 145 and six for nineteen against the Melbourne Cricket Club, the largest club in Melbourne whose team included many Test and first-class cricketers.|$|E
5|$|Huston {{continually}} {{took the}} side of his players in any argument they had against Huggins, criticizing Huggins in the press when the Yankees lost <b>the</b> <b>pennant</b> in 1920. Meanwhile, Ruppert was at best a lukewarm advocate of Huggins. Babe Ruth resisted Huggins' discipline; he did not respect Huggins due to his small stature, soft-spoken nature, and inability to fight, and Huggins was unable to enforce punishments on Ruth. The Yankees finished third in the AL in 1919 and 1920. Huggins signed a one-year contract to remain with the team in 1921.|$|E

5|$|In April 1966, Kerlan told Koufax it {{was time}} to retire and that his arm could not take another season. Koufax kept Kerlan's advice to himself and went out every fourth day to pitch. He ended up {{pitching}} 323 innings, a 27–9 record, and a 1.73 ERA. Since then, no left-hander has had more wins, nor a lower ERA, in a season (Phillies pitcher Steve Carlton did match the 27-win mark in 1972). In the final game of the regular season, the Dodgers had to beat the Phillies to win <b>the</b> <b>pennant.</b> In the second game of a doubleheader, Koufax faced Jim Bunning for the second time that season, in a match-up between perfect game winners. Koufax, on two days rest, pitched a complete game, 6–3 victory to clinch <b>the</b> <b>pennant.</b> He started 41 games (for {{the second year in a}} row); only two left-handers started as many games in any season over the ensuing years through 2016.|$|E
5|$|In the 1957 season, Turley {{developed}} a curveball. He finished {{the season with}} a 2.71 ERA, good for fourth-best in the American League. The Yankees won <b>the</b> <b>pennant</b> again. In the 1957 World Series against the Milwaukee Braves, Turley started Game Three, but was relieved by Larsen in the second inning. He won his first World Series game in Game Six, a complete game. The Yankees lost the series to the Braves, four games to three.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} {{series of the}} 1924 season, the Giants were playing the Philadelphia Phillies at the Polo Grounds and battling for <b>the</b> <b>pennant</b> with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Jimmy O'Connell offered Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand $500 to {{intentionally}} lose the games. Sand rejected the bribe and reported it to Phillies manager Art Fletcher. It {{eventually led to the}} lifetime suspension of O'Connell and Giants coach Cozy Dolan by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. O'Connell implicated Kelly, Frankie Frisch, and Ross Youngs as co-conspirators. However, Commissioner Landis cleared Kelly, Frisch and Youngs of any wrongdoing.|$|E
