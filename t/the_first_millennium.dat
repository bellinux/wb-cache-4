5|$|Overall Set {{was viewed}} with ambivalence, until during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>millennium</b> BCE {{he came to}} be seen as a totally malevolent deity. This {{transformation}} was prompted more by his association with foreign lands than by the Osiris myth. Nevertheless, in these late times, the widespread temple rituals involving the ceremonial annihilation of Set were often connected with the myth.|$|E
5|$|The {{concepts}} of angle and radius were already used by ancient peoples of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>millennium</b> BC.

5|$|The {{kingdom of}} Qatna had a {{predominantly}} Semitic Amorite population; all the personal names from Qatna in the Mari archive were Amorite.

5|$|Camel {{hybridisation}} {{began in}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>millennium</b> BC. For {{about a thousand}} years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries have been successfully bred in regions where they are sympatric to form hybrids with either a long, slightly lopsided hump or two humps – one small and one large. These hybrids are larger and stronger than their parents – they can bear greater loads. A cross between a first generation female hybrid and a male Bactrian camel can also produce a hybrid. Hybrids from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} urban {{settlement}} {{in the area of}} modern-day Dhaka dates to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>millennium.</b> The region was part of the ancient district of Bikrampur, which was ruled by the Sena dynasty.

The Grand Trunk Road passed through the region, connecting it with North India, Central Asia and the southeastern port city of Chittagong.|$|E

China maintained its virtual monopoly over silk production for another thousand years. Not confined to clothing, silk was also used for a number of other applications, including writing, and the color of silk worn was an important guide of social class during the Tang Dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Through {{the work}} of {{classical}} writers such as Plutarch, knowledge of the Osiris myth was preserved even after the middle of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>millennium</b> AD, when Egyptian religion ceased to exist {{and knowledge of the}} writing systems that were originally used to record the myth were lost. The myth remained a major part of Western impressions of ancient Egypt. In modern times, when understanding of Egyptian beliefs is informed by the original Egyptian sources, the story continues to influence and inspire new ideas, from works of fiction to scholarly speculation and new religious movements.|$|E
5|$|After a lack {{of records}} from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>millennium,</b> Zaprešić again became known in the late 11thcentury. In 1094, {{following}} {{the formation of the}} Zagreb Diocese, Ača, an advisor of the Croato–Hungarian King Ladislav I, was granted land west and east of the Medvednica Mountain to protect the newly formed diocese. Zaprešić became part of the Susedgrad–Stubica manor, the second-biggest estate in the Croato-Hungarian Zagreb County. In 1334, the parish church of St. Peter was founded in Zaprešić, marking the first evidence of the modern settlement of Zaprešić. The settlement developed rapidly, which is attributed to its position on important trade and transit routes. This was corroborated by the route of the first railway in Croatia, which passes through Zaprešić.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>millennium,</b> the Hoysalas gained power in the region. Literature flourished during this time, {{which led to the}} {{emergence}} of distinctive Kannada literary metres, and the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the Vesara style of architecture. The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought minor parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under its rule. In the early 14th century, Harihara and Bukka Raya established the Vijayanagara empire with its capital, Hosapattana (later named Vijayanagara), {{on the banks of the}} Tungabhadra River in the modern Bellary district. The empire rose as a bulwark against Muslim advances into South India, which it completely controlled for over two centuries.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>millennium,</b> the boar was worshipped as {{a symbol}} of virility. The Chalukya dynasty (543–753) was the first dynasty to adopt Varaha in their crest and minted coins with Varaha on it. The Gurjara-Pratihara king Mihira Bhoja (836–885 CE) assumed the title of Adi-varaha and also minted coins {{depicting}} the Varaha image. Varaha was also adopted as a part of royal insignia by the Chola (4th century BCE–1279 CE) and Vijayanagara Empires (1336–1646 CE) of South India. In Karnataka, a zoomorphic image of Varaha is found in a carving on a pillar in Aihole, which is interpreted as the Vijayanagara emblem, as it is seen along with signs of a cross marked Sun, a disc and a conch.|$|E
5|$|Little {{evidence}} of an occupation on the tell exists following {{the destruction of the}} Mitannian city, however, a series of small villages existed in the lower town during the Assyrian periods. The remains of a Hellenistic settlement were discovered on a nearby satellite tell, to the northwestern edge of the main tell. However, excavations recovered no ceramics of the Parthian-Roman or Byzantine-Sasanian periods, although sherds dating to those periods are noted. In the middle of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>millennium</b> AD, a fortified building was erected in the northeastern lower town. The building was dated by Antoine Poidebard to the Justinian era (sixth century AD), {{on the basis of its}} architecture. The last occupation period of the site was during the early Abbasid Caliphate's period, when a canal was built to provide the town with water from the nearby Jaghjagh River.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} {{has been with}} humans {{since at least the}} Bronze Age. The oldest known {{surgical}} treatise – the Edwin Smith Papyrus, dating to about 1500 BCE – describes a diagnostic test and treatment for a vertebral sprain. Hippocrates (c. 460 BCE – c. 370 BCE) was the first to use a term for sciatic pain and low back pain; Galen (active mid to late second century CE) described the concept in some detail. Physicians through the end of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>millennium</b> did not attempt back surgery and recommended watchful waiting. Through the Medieval period, folk medicine practitioners provided treatments for back pain {{based on the belief that}} it was caused by spirits.|$|E

5|$|The Romans {{produced}} considerable {{quantities of}} brass (an alloy of zinc and copper) {{as early as}} 200 BC by a cementation process where copper was reacted with zinc oxide. The zinc oxide {{is thought to have}} been produced by heating zinc ore in a shaft furnace. This liberated metallic zinc as a vapor, which then ascended the flue and condensed as the oxide. This process was described by Dioscorides in the 1st century AD. Zinc oxide has also been recovered from zinc mines at Zawar in India, dating from the second half of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>millennium</b> BC. This was presumably also made in the same way and used to produce brass.|$|E
5|$|The {{field in}} which the hoard was {{discovered}} was shown by the 1994 excavation to probably have been cleared by the early Bronze Age, when it began {{to be used for}} agriculture and settlement. Some settlement activity occurred near the hoard findspot by the first half of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>millennium</b> BC, but {{there is no evidence of}} Roman buildings in the immediate vicinity. The field where the hoard was deposited may have been in cultivation during the early phase of the Roman period but the apparent absence of fourth-century coins suggests that it may have been converted to pasture or else had reverted to woodland by that time.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{departure}} of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been {{the southern part of the}} Brittonic kingdom of Elmet, with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part of the boundary between this kingdom and the kingdom of Mercia. Gradually, Anglian settlers pushed west from the kingdom of Deira. A Britonnic presence within the Sheffield area is evidenced by two settlements called Wales and Waleswood close to Sheffield. The settlements that grew and merged to form Sheffield, however, date from the second half of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>millennium,</b> and are of Anglo-Saxon and Danish origin. In Anglo-Saxon times, the Sheffield area straddled the border between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that Eanred of Northumbria submitted to Egbert of Wessex at the hamlet of Dore (now a suburb of Sheffield) in 829, a key event in the unification of the kingdom of England under the House of Wessex.|$|E
