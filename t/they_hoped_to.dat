5|$|Enver Pasha {{conceived}} {{an expedition}} to Afghanistan in 1914. He envisioned it as a pan-Islamic venture directed by Turkey, with some German participation. The German delegation to this expedition, chosen by Oppenheim and Zimmermann, included Oskar Niedermayer and Wilhelm Wassmuss. An escort of nearly a thousand Turkish troops and German advisers was to accompany the delegation through Persia into Afghanistan, where <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> rally local tribes to jihad.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{realized}} that the sole intention of the Athenian support for Argeus was to recover Amphipolis (see below), which <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> do by placing Argeus on the throne. Philip therefore withdrew the Macedonian garrison from Amphipolis and declared it autonomous, to undermine the purpose of Athenian support for Argeus.|$|E
5|$|The Akron Pros, {{who were}} named the Akron Indians, {{finished}} 5–5 in their 1919 {{season in the}} Ohio League. The Indians lost money because of the constant poor performance; the team did not win an Ohio League Championship since 1914. The Indians was sold to Art Ranney and Frank Nied. The two changed the team name to the Akron Pros, as <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> achieve a better record and crowd.|$|E

5|$|A {{social control}} program was {{implemented}} whereby local unions took on responsibility for ensuring that this quota was not exceeded; in doing so, <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> remove {{the need for}} military and police intervention, and thus stem the violence of previous decades. Measures were implemented to ensure the industrialization of coca production, with Morales inaugurating the first coca industrialization plant in Chulumani, which produced and packaged coca and trimate tea; the project was primarily funded through a $125,000 donation from Venezuela under the PTA scheme.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the rebellion, most of the {{remaining}} insurgents attempted to escape eastwards across the Shire Highlands, towards Portuguese East Africa, from where <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> head north to German territory. Chilembwe was seen by a patrol of Nyasaland police and shot dead on 3 February near Mlanje. Many other rebels were captured; 300 were imprisoned following the rebellion and 40 were executed. Around 30 rebels evaded capture and settled in Portuguese territory near the Nyasaland border.|$|E
5|$|As the 2002 trade {{deadline}} approached, teams {{interested in}} acquiring Shuey began to inquire on his availability. On July 28, 2002, before the trade deadline, Shuey {{was traded to}} the Los Angeles Dodgers for Terry Mulholland and minor leaguers Ricardo Rodríguez and Francisco Cruceta. With the Dodgers in the playoff chase that season, <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> pair him with closer Éric Gagné to form a strong bullpen for the later portions of games.|$|E

5|$|Kemp's {{ankle injury}} {{took a lot}} longer to heal than had been expected, and the team {{reported}} that <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> get him back in September. However, when he finally began his minor league rehab assignment at Class-A Rancho Cucamonga in late August, he struggled at the plate and his return date was pushed back. He went hitless in five games, with seven strikeouts, and when the minor league season ended on September 2 he was moved to Camelback Ranch to continue his rehab rather than being activated.|$|E
5|$|Lochry's {{force was}} part of an army being raised by George Rogers Clark for a {{campaign}} against Detroit, the British regional headquarters. Clark, the preeminent American military leader on the northwestern frontier, worked with Governor Thomas Jefferson of Virginia in planning an expedition to capture Detroit, by which <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> bring an end to British support of the Indian war effort. In early August 1781, Clark and about 400 men left Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania by boat, floating down the Ohio River a few days ahead of Lochry and his men, who were trying to catch up.|$|E
5|$|Some {{players who}} participated in the 2000 Sugar Bowl elected to delay their entry into the NFL Draft, either because <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> finish their {{education}} or because they were not three years removed from their high school graduations and thus were not eligible to enter the draft. Examples of these players included Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke, who returned to Florida State to complete his senior year, and Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick, who was not eligible to enter the draft in 2000, but who was taken with the first overall selection in the 2001 NFL Draft.|$|E

50|$|Intel {{plans to}} share this {{technology}} with other companies such as HP, Yahoo, and Microsoft to have multiple companies researching the SCC to more efficiently and quickly advance the technology. <b>They</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> make the SCC scalable to 100+ cores. One way <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> achieve this is by having each chip {{be able to communicate}} with another chip, and they could put two chips together to get double the cores. <b>They</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> improve the parallel programming productivity and power management {{to take advantage of the}} chip's architecture and large number of cores. Additionally they plan to experiment more with this architecture and similar chip architectures to develop a many-core scalable processors that maximizes the processing power of the cores while being power efficient.|$|R

5|$|Speidel {{met with}} former foreign {{minister}} Konstantin von Neurath and Strölin on 27 May in Germany, ostensibly at Rommel's request, although {{the latter was}} not present. Neurath and Strölin suggested opening immediate surrender negotiations with the West, and, according to Speidel, Rommel agreed to further discussions and preparations. However, {{around the same time}} the plotters in Berlin were not aware that Rommel had reportedly decided {{to take part in the}} conspiracy. On 16 May, they informed Allen Dulles, through whom <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> negotiate with the Western Allies, that Rommel could not be counted on for support.|$|E
5|$|The large {{remaining}} building currently {{stands in}} amongst a small industrial estate {{at the foot}} of the nearby Lemington Glass Cone. Along with the neighbouring Ironworks site, it is owned by Norland Construction, a crane and plant company formerly known as Reeds Cranes and Plant, the building used as storage for their machinery. The site is thought to be contaminated with coal products, fuels and oils such as PCBs, as well as dioxins and furans. In 2003, Newcastle City Council released plans that <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> redevelop the site for heritage tourism in the future.|$|E
5|$|Tickets on the Signatur {{service cost}} NOK25 more than with {{conventional}} trains, which {{would continue to}} run. Tickets were also made available via Amadeus, a ticket reservation system in Norway previously only used for airlines. Prices became differentiated, with prices between Oslo and Kristiansand varying between NOK250 and 780, depending on time of travel and class. NSB stated that <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> compete with airlines between the two cities, as travel time from city center to center {{was about the same}} as by plane.|$|E

5|$|After the Democrats' electoral {{victories}} in 1951 and 1955, <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> further solidify their hold on city offices by ousting the few Republicans left in power. At the same time, however, they {{were faced with}} growing divisions within their own party. Democrats had won in 1951 by combining with reform-minded Republicans and independents. By 1954, however, some Democrats led by Council President James Hugh Joseph Tate tried to weaken the civil service reforms of the new charter by allowing city employees {{to become involved in}} electioneering once more. They fell just short of the two-thirds vote in Council to put their amendments on the ballot, but in 1956, Tate's faction again proposed charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections and this time found the required vote to put it on to the ballot for popular approval. The referendum failed in a vote that April.|$|E
5|$|Brock {{continually}} {{kept the}} commanders of his posts informed of all developments. When {{news of the}} outbreak of war reached him, he sent a canoe party under the noted trader and voyager William McKay to the British outpost at St. Joseph Island on Lake Huron. His orders to commander (Captain Charles Roberts) allowed him {{to stand on the}} defensive or attack the nearby American outpost at Fort Mackinac at his discretion. Roberts immediately launched an attack on Fort Mackinac with a scratch force of regulars, fur traders, and First Nations warriors. On 17 July, the American garrison was taken by surprise (not being aware that war had been declared) and surrendered. This victory immediately encouraged many First Nations tribes, who had hitherto been neutral or undecided, to give their active support to the British. <b>They</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> expel the American settlers from their territories west of the Appalachian Mountains.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the Japanese {{maintained}} separate {{army and}} navy headquarters at Rabaul which cooperated {{with each other}} but were responsible to different higher authorities. Naval forces came under the Southeast Area Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Jinichi Kusaka. Army forces came under General Hitoshi Imamura's Eighth Area Army, consisting of the XVII Army in the Solomon Islands, Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi's XVIII Army in New Guinea, and the 6th Air Division, based at Rabaul. As {{a result of the}} destruction of a convoy carrying reinforcements in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, the Japanese decided not send any more convoys to Lae, but instead to land troops at Hansa Bay and Wewak and move them forward to Lae by barge or submarine. In the long run <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> complete a road over the Finisterre Range and thence to Lae through the Ramu and Markham Valleys.|$|E

5|$|Cardiff City {{prepared}} for the final at Southport, Lancashire, at the Palace Hotel. The players kept relaxed with massages, games of bowls and salt baths. On {{the day before the}} match travelled to Harrow on the Hill where they stayed at the Kings Head Hotel. They were open with the press about their tactics, saying <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> subdue Arsenal's attack by having Billy Hardy keep Buchan at bay. Cardiff were free to choose their first choice team, unhindered by injuries. They selected the same team as had featured against Reading in the semi-final, with the exception of Harry Wake, despite his experience from playing in the FA Cup final two seasons prior.|$|E
5|$|Despite his ongoing {{research}} in Guiana, what Beebe desired most was {{to return to}} the Galápagos, this time with a properly fitted-out scientific research vessel that possessed the ability to dredge animals from beneath the ocean. In 1925, Beebe set out on a second Galápagos expedition, backed by Williams and several other donors. His ship for this expedition was the Arcturus, a steam yacht considerably larger than the Noma that was capable of being at sea for extended periods of time. The Arcturus was outfitted with Beebe's pulpit and boom walk from the Noma, as well as cages and tanks for live animals, chemicals and vials to preserve dead ones, and a darkroom for developing film and studying the bioluminescent animals <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> encounter.|$|E
5|$|Himmler's organised, bookish intellect {{served him}} well as he began setting up {{different}} SS departments. In 1931 he appointed Reinhard Heydrich chief of the new Ic Service (intelligence service), which was renamed the Sicherheitsdienst (SD: Security Service) in 1932. He later officially appointed Heydrich his deputy. The two men had a good working relationship and a mutual respect. In 1933, they began to remove the SS from SA control. Along with Interior Minister Frick, <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> create a unified German police force. In March 1933, Reich Governor of Bavaria Franz Ritter von Epp appointed Himmler chief of the Munich Police. Himmler appointed Heydrich commander of Department IV, the political police. That same year, Hitler promoted Himmler {{to the rank of}} SS-Obergruppenführer, equal in rank to the senior SA commanders. Thereafter, Himmler and Heydrich took over the political police of state after state; soon only Prussia was controlled by Göring.|$|E
