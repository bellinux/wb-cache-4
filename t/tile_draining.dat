40|$|In areas {{dominated}} by agricultural land use, excess nitrate {{is one of}} the leading contributors to water pollution. Tile drains, installed to drain crop root zones for maximum yield, fast track the introduction of nitrate-laden water into a nearby stream. Due to the risks elevated levels of nitrate pose to an ecosystem and its inhabitants, the following project explores a method of reducing nitrate pollution. One that can do it as close to the source of the pollution as possible. A <b>tile</b> <b>draining</b> a 60 acre farm in central Illinois was redirected to discharge its contents through subsurface flow into an herbaceous riparian buffer zone (RBZ) located immediately below the farm. A transect of nested observation wells were installed across the riparian buffer intersecting the redirected subsurface tiles. A study on the groundwater and soils was performed to determine the ability the RBZ has for nitrate reduction/removal. Prior to redirecting tile water into the RBZ, chemical analysis of the RBZ water showed low concentrations of NO 3 -–N (≤ 5 mg/L). The conditions necessary for the reduction/removal of nitrate, such as low levels of dissolved oxygen, dissolved organic carbon, and organic matter in the soils, and groundwater temperature were also investigated. A statistical comparison of the concentration of NO 3 -–N at the wells (effluent) vs the diversion box (influent) shows that the waters are significantly different (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Concentrations measured in the diversion box leading to the riparian buffer averaged 13. 6 mg/L.

40|$|Wheat was a {{profitable}} crop in Iowa until about 1870, and averaged from 20 to 30 bushels per acre. Since then, {{on account of}} deterioration ol soils, changes of climate, rust, blight and chinch bugs, the acreage and average yield have grown less steadily. Last year the average yield of wheat in the state was nine bushels per acre, and in 1881 it ran as low as six bushels. At the present time we are depending on Minnesota and Dakota for {{a large share of}} our bread, but the constant falling off in the yield and quality of the wheat in the states just named indicates, that we will have to go farther for it before long or grow it ourselves. One of our tasks at the Iowa Experiment Station will be, to produce hardier and more productive kinds of wheat than those which we have now, and determine the best methods of preparing the ground for them. Last year we sowed twelve kinds of wheat broad-cast, at the rate of 75 ft 3 ̆es per acre on undrained ground which received only ordinary preparation; but all of them proved worthless on account of rust and blight. Last summer, we broke up an old pasture to the depth of four inches after <b>tile</b> <b>draining</b> it. Last March, 2. 30 acres of this plat were thoroughly pulverized with a disc and reversible harrow and sowed broad-cast at the rate of 7 oft»s per acre with the following kinds of wheat, viz: Black Sea, Fife, White Fife, Manitoba Fife, Golden Globe and Lost Nation. The ground was then thoroughly harrowed and rolled. Immediately afterwards, I applied top-dressings of Peruvian guano, land plaster and common salt to strips running across the different kinds of wheat, leaving other strips between them not fertilized. All of the varieties grew well and promised a good crop-until most of their blossoms had fallen, when— about one-fifth of the plat, including all of the varieties, was blown down by a rain storm. A few days alter the storm, the entire piece of wheat showed much rust and more or less blight. I was unable to discover that any of the different kinds of wheat had been affected by the guano or the land plaster; but I did see clearly, that the best wheat and the cleanest straw was on the strip to which I had applied salt. As I did not consider any of the varieties sufficiently rust-proof to warrant me in sowing them again, I threshed them together in tbe field on July 30 th and the yield of the mixture per acre, proved to be 19 bushels o f more or less shriveled wheat. On {{the south end of the}} Station grounds is a plat of i TV acres, three-fifths of which is old ground and the remainder was a low, wet slough, which was thoroughly drained and broken in June, 1888. Last fall this plat was plowed to the depth of eight inches, and last March it was well pulverized with a disc and reversible harrow, when it was sowed, (broad-cast) with one bushel of Velvet Chaff Blue Stem wheat and then harrowed and rolled thoroughly. It came up well, stooled well and made a large growth; but on the lowest ground about one-fifth of the wheat was blown down when it was in blossom and remained down. A few days afterwards, I noticed that the blades of the blue-stem wheat were slightly rusted, but at no time did any appear on its stalks.

Lake Macatawa is a hypereutrophic lake located in west Michigan, and the watershed is dominated by row crop agriculture. Further research is needed to understand the influence of bioavailable P originating from <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> on water quality in Lake Macatawa. The objectives of this study were to 1) conduct a <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> effluent sampling survey to assess their importance as a source of P in the Macatawa Watershed; 2) investigate the change in <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> P concentrations spatially and temporally over a one-year period; and 3) use growth chamber algal bioassays and the ratio of soluble reactive phosphorus to total phosphorus (SRP:TP) to assess <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> P bioavailability.

40|$|PURPOSE: An {{essential}} nutrient for plant growth, phosphorus (P) is often implicated as {{a contributing factor}} to algal blooms. Lake Macatawa is a hypereutrophic lake located in west Michigan, and the watershed is dominated by row crop agriculture. The objectives {{of this study were}} to assess agricultural <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> as a source of P in the Macatawa Watershed. SUBJECTS: Nine <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> outlets in the Macatawa Watershed from March 2015 – February 2016. METHODS: 1) Conduct a <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> effluent survey by measuring soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP) once per month; 2) investigate the change in <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> P concentrations temporally over a one-year period; and 3) use seasonal algal bioassays to measure the bioavailability of P found within the <b>tile</b> <b>drains.</b> ANALYSIS: Kruskal-Wallis tests with a Holm’s adjustment compared P concentrations between sample sites and between sample dates. Linear regression was used to relate SRP concentration to algal growth after the bioassays. RESULTS: <b>Tile</b> <b>drain</b> outlet SRP and TP concentrations varied temporally and spatially. The SRP:TP ratio measured at the <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> outlets had a significant, positive correlation with acreage <b>drained</b> by the <b>tile</b> system.

The fully-coupled physically-based hydrology models are important tools for evaluating these environmental issues and agroeconomic benefits by considering the subsurface drainage practices into the integrated surface and subsurface flow environment at the agricultural fields.

The essence is to represent worm burrows as morphologically connected paths of low flow resistance in a hillslope model.

We thus simulated transport of bromide for the 13 spatial model setups that performed best with respect to reproduce <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> event discharge, without any further calibration. All model setups allowed a very good prediction of the temporal dynamics of cumulated bromide leaching into the <b>tile</b> <b>drain,</b> while only four of them matched the accumulated water balance and accumulated bromide loss into the <b>tile</b> <b>drain.</b> The number of behavioural model architectures could thus be reduced to four.

Stable isotope concentrations were monitored in the irrigation water, the <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> discharge and the soil water before and after the experiment. Bromide was measured at mainly every 5 – 15 min in the <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> hydrograph. Different initial conditions for each experiment were used to examine how pre-event soil moisture conditions influenced flow and transport. Different amounts of irrigation water were necessary to increase <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> discharge above the base flow level.

40|$|Understanding the {{dynamics}} of groundwater-surface water interaction is needed to evaluate and simulate water and solute transport in catchments.

For this study, we physically separated the <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> discharge toward a 43. 5 m ditch transect from the groundwater-plus-overland flow routes. Direct groundwater flow and ephemeral overland flow were jointly captured in three sheet pile in-stream reservoirs, while the effluent from three <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> outlets was collected in vessels. Our flux measurements showed that, {{in response to a}} rainfall event, the <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> contribution to the total ditch discharge decreased from 80 % to 28 %. We used these flow route measurements to calibrate a field-scale integrated water transport model. The HydroGeoSphere code was used because it simultaneously solves the flow regimes in the variably saturated domain, the <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> domain, and the surface flow domain. This simultaneous solution is needed for a correct representation of the mutual interactions between groundwater flow, <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> flow, and ditch water flow. Our model produced a flow distribution between the flow paths which deviated only 2 % from the measured flow distribution. A sensitivity analysis showed that model parameters related to <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> entrance resistance and to the resistance to water flow through the surface water system controlled the water flow route distribution but with little effect on groundwater levels.

The Grand River watershed spans approximately 290 km with an area of approximately 6, 800 km². Approximately 90 % of the watershed is agricultural land some of which is <b>tile</b> <b>drained.</b> These <b>tile</b> <b>drains,</b> which cover approximately 15 % of the total land of the watershed, are installed to augment field drainage. The <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> usually outlet somewhere along the perimeter of a property; the discharge then typically moves along the surface until it discharges into a surface water body such as a river, pond, or lake. Investigating {{the impact of}} climate change on agricultural tile drainage at a watershed scale can be achieved using modelling. The <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> can affect both the water quality and the water quantity of a watershed. With the potential climatic changes, the storm intensity, and growing season also could change.

The data for <b>tile</b> <b>drained</b> areas was added to land use/land class and soil data for the watershed to produce a map of <b>tile</b> <b>drained</b> agricultural areas.

40|$|Due to {{naturally}} high groundwater tables, many soils in the Midwest need {{artificial drainage}} for economical crop production. However, nitrate carried in drainage water {{can lead to}} water quality problems. Controlled drainage is a strategy to reduce the nitrate loads and maintain adequate drainage from crop production by regulating drainage depth with a water-level control device at the drainage outlet. This dissertation addresses nitrate loads from subsurface drainage and the potential benefit of controlled drainage at the watershed scale. Two methods were applied to estimate the contribution of <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> to watershed nitrate load: a statistical analysis of many watersheds and a simulation of water flow and chemical processes for a particular watershed. Watershed boundaries were delineated for 29 gaging stations in Indiana, where nitrate and flow have been monitored, {{and the percentage of}} each watershed that is <b>drained</b> by subsurface <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> was estimated from soil, slope, and land use characteristics. Statistical models were developed to relate the percentage of the watershed with subsurface drains and the non-point source nitrate loads, with and without precipitation as an additional explanatory variable. Significant relationships were found for annual models both with and without precipitation, from February to June for monthly models without precipitation and from January to July for monthly models with precipitation. Expected annual and monthly non-point source nitrate loads were calculated for various percentages of drained area in Indiana watersheds based on the models with precipitation. Predicted annual non-point source nitrate load ranged from 383 kg/yr/km 2 for a watershed with 0 % drained area to 2750 kg/yr/km 2 for a watershed with 100 % drained area, which suggested that about 86 % of non-point source nitrate coming from a 100 % drained watershed would flow through <b>tile</b> <b>drains.</b> SWAT 2005, with modified <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> components, was used to simulate nitrate loss through <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> in a heavily <b>tile</b> <b>drained</b> watershed in Indiana, the Sugar Creek watershed. Nitrate loads from surface flow, lateral flow, percolation and <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> were estimated. The median percentage of monthly nitrate input to Sugar Creek that came from <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> ranged from 0 % to 37 % over the 12 months, and was more than 30 % from April to June. These estimates of nitrate from <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> were used to predict the potential effects of controlled drainage at the watershed scale. Previous field and plot scale research in the Midwest suggested that the likely percentage reduction was 25 % to 47 % in Indiana. For 29 watersheds in Indiana, areas with high and medium potential for controlled drainage were estimated based on appropriate crop, soil types and topography. If controlled drainage was applied in all fields with high potential, the watershed-scale percentage of reduction could reach 8. 7 - 16. 4 %.

Cultivated areas often expanded at the expense of grassland and wetlands located in lowland areas (de Groot et al., 2002). Therefore, large modifications were made to the agricultural landscapes: stream redesign, land consolidation, removal of hedges, and installation of tile drainage networks to drain the hydromorphic soils. These changes modified sediment processes and resulted in large morphological alterations (e. g. channel bed incision, deposition of fine sediment, channel bank erosion). Accordingly, these alterations threaten water quality and prevent to meet the requirements of the European directives. Improving water quality requires a clear understanding of the hydrosedimentary dynamics in these lowland cultivated catchments. However, few studies were conducted in drained environments. To fill this research gap, a pilot study was started in cultivated catchment of the Loire River basin, France, where <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> densities are very high (> 1. 5 km/km²). Six hydro-sedimentary monitoring stations were installed in the Louroux catchment (24 km²).

Results indicated a dynamic interaction between benthic sediment and overlying water column where sediments were acting as a sink or a source of P. There were no differences in nutrient retention ability between sediments collected upstream and sediments collected downstream from the selected <b>tile</b> <b>drains.</b> While the data, except for ExN, was comparable to reported values by previous studies in Indiana’s drainage ditches, there was no particular seasonal pattern {{in the content of}} exchangeable nutrient content in sediments at all three sites. This study also suggested that nutrient uptake by benthic sediments in these drainage ditches is not always efficient; therefore watershed management should focus on minimizing the delivery of nutrients into ditches while maintaining their drainage functionality...|$|R
40|$|Effluent from {{agricultural}} <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> {{has been}} identified a source of phosphorus (P) to water bodies, contributing to algal blooms and water quality degradation. Reduced till (RT) or no-till are Best Management Practices (BMP) often used to limit the export of particulate P (PP) in runoff. However, existing {{research has shown that}} no-till may increase losses of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in <b>tile</b> <b>drains.</b> Much of the existing knowledge has been generated in clay soil, where preferential transport between the surface and <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> prevails. Moreover, much of the previous work done has been done during the growing season. It is unclear if, and how P losses under RT tillage practices compare to those under annual tillage (AT) in the sandy loam soils of southern Ontario, and, how these BMPs perform year-round in climates where snowmelt accounts for significant amount of annual runoff. The objectives of this research are to quantify year-round losses of runoff, DRP and total phosphorus (TP) from <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> beneath RT and AT plots and to demonstrate the role of seasonality on losses. This research also relates biogeochemical and hydrological responses in drainage tiles to precipitation inputs and antecedent soil moisture conditions as drivers of effluent and P-export. Tile runoff and chemistry were monitored for a 28 -month period at two adjacent sites under similar management practices. Both runoff and P-export were episodic across all plots, with the majority of annual losses occurring during a few key events under heavy precipitation or snowmelt. Most losses occurred during the non-growing season between October and May. Tillage methods did not affect DRP or TP concentrations or loads in <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> effluent. <b>Tile</b> discharge and responses were governed by soil moisture conditions such that flow only occurred at soil moisture conditions that fell above a threshold value (above field capacity, near saturation). Runoff responses during the non-growing season were high because soils sit at or close to this threshold consistently. Strong relationships were found between volume of discharge and DRP and TP loads, indicating that with known baseline conditions, simple hydrometric data may be able to predict biogeochemical and hydrologic responses in drainage tiles under sandy loam soils. This study emphasizes the importance of the non-growing season and snowmelt in annual P losses from <b>tile</b> <b>drains,</b> illustrating that BMPs must be effective during the winter months to reduce P losses. The cumulative BMPs used at the study site appear to be fairly effective at minimizing P losses in <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> effluent under both RT and AT plots. This study also provides useful insight for modeling runoff and P losses in tile drainage...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The {{extent of}} {{agricultural}} drainage has created concern for its potential undesirable effects on surface water quality. Land applications of liquid manure on <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> fields {{have the potential}} to transport solutes and bacteria to the drains following precipitation or irrigation events and many times are directly sent to a surface water body, and have been documented as a source of contamination of surface waters. This study determined the potential for and magnitude of E. coli and solute migration to <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> through the soil profile. Water from subsurface drains was analyzed for chemical and bacterial composition following tracer applications. Two sites were selected for the study to determine transport at large (field) and small (plot) scales. At the large-scale site, both tracers, bacteria (E. coli and Total Coliform) and Amino-G (a conservative tracer), were used to monitor the speed of transport from the surface to the <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> following liquid manure applications, tracer applications and additionally precipitation events. The concentrations of E. coli were monitored every hour for 76 days during the spring. Both tracers, bacteria and Amino-G, were detected in the tile drainage shortly after precipitation events. The peak concentration of E. coli was observed to be 1. 2 x 10 ⁶ CFU/l 00 mL. These elevated concentrations of E. coli might be attributed to the characteristics of the soil, high organic matter and well-structured clay soils. Both the rapid breakthrough of tracer to the <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> and the peaks of tile water temperature during precipitation events provided evidence of macropore flow. Antecedent soil moisture and warmer temperatures appeared to provide ideal conditions for bacteria growth. The small-scale study site was selected for a more focused study. The purpose of this site was to quantify more accurately the percent mass of surface applied tracer that was transported to the <b>tile</b> <b>drain,</b> allowing mass balance calculations. Experiments were conducted during the summer to control the rate and total amount of irrigation. Amino-G readings were taken every 10 seconds for 125 hours of continuous irrigation. Tracer applications were conducted at runoff and non-runoff conditions. Both types of tracer applications had Amino-G breakthrough in less than 10 minutes after initiation of irrigation. Tracer applied at runoff rates resulted in 4 to 17 times more total tracer mass migrating to the <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> than when applied at non-runoff rates. The total mass of Amino-G migrating to the <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> during non-runoff conditions depended on the total volume of applied tracer, regardless of the tracer concentration. For an application of 5. 6 mm at 12 mg/L, 5. 7...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{phosphorus}} (P) concen-trations and fluxes in <b>tile</b> <b>drains,</b> overland flow, and streamflow {{at a high}} {{temporal resolution}} during 7 spring storms in an agricultural water-shed in Indiana, USA. Research goals include {{a better understanding of}} 1) how bulk precipita-tion and antecedent moisture conditions affect P concentrations and fluxes at the watershed scale; 2) how P concentrations and fluxes meas-ured in <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> translate to the whole wa-tershed scale; 3) whether P losses to the stream are significantly affected by overland flow. Re-sults indicate that bulk precipitation and ante-cedent moisture conditions are not good pre-dictors of SRP or TP losses (either concentra-tion or flux) to the stream. However, along with previously published storm data in this water-shed, results indicate a threshold-based behave-ior whereby SRP and TP fluxes significantly in-crease with precipitation when bulk precipita-tion exceeds 4 cm. Although total SRP and TP fluxes are very much driven by flow, SRP and TP fluxes are somewhat limited by the amount of P available for leaching for most storms. On av-erage, SRP fluxes in <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> are 13 % greater than in the stream, and stream SRP fluxes ac-count for 45 % of TP fluxes at the watershed scale. Our results indicate that when P is the primary concern, best management practices aimed at reducing P losses via <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> are likely to have the most effect on P exports at the watershed scale...|$|R

Th is paper evaluates the eff ect of fertilizer rate and timing on nitrate losses in two (East and West) commercial row crop fi elds located in south-central Minnesota. Th e Agricultural Drainage and Pesticide Transport (ADAPT) model was calibrated and validated for monthly subsurface <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> fl ow and nitrate losses {{for a period of}} 1999 – 2003. Good agreement was found between observed and predicted <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> fl ow and nitrate losses during the calibration period, with Nash-Sutcliff e modeling effi ciencies of 0. 75 and 0. 56, respectively. Better agreements were observed for the validation period. Th e calibrated model was then used to evaluate the eff ects of rate and timing of fertilizer application on nitrate losses with a 50 -yr climatic record (1954 – 2003). Signifi cant reductions in nitrate losses were predicted by reducing fertilizer application rates and changing timing. A 13 % reduction in nitrate losses was predicted when fall fertilizer application rate was reduced from 180 to 123 kg/ha. A further 9 % reduction in nitrate losses can be achieved when switching from fall to spring application. Larger reductions in nitrate losses would require changes in fertilizer rate and timing, as well as other practices such as changing <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> spacings and/or depths, fall cover cropping, or conversion of crop land to pasture...|$|R

40|$|Much of Iowa is {{characterized}} by relatively flat, poorly-drained areas which with extensive subsurface drainage, have became {{some of the most}} valuable, productive land in the State. However, this drained land has also become a source of significant NO 3 loss because of the changes in land-use and hydrology brought about by tile drainage. While surface runoff is decreased with subsurface drainage (resulting in decreased losses of sediment, ammoniumnitrogen, phosphorus, pesticides and micro-organisms), subsurface flow and leaching losses of NO 3 are increased. This is due mostly to an increase in volume and the “short-circuiting” of subsurface flow, but also in part to the increased aeration of organic-rich soils with potentially increased mineralization and formation of NO 3 (and less denitrification) in the soil profile. The problem of excess nutrient loads can probably be ameliorated by a combination of in field and off site practices, but the limitations and appropriateness of alternative practices must be understood and outcomes must be measurable. Promising in field practices include nutrient management, drainage management, and alternative cropping systems. Nitrate-removal wetlands are a proven edge-of-field practice for reducing nitrate loads to downstream water bodies and are a particularly promising approach in <b>tile</b> <b>drained</b> landscapes. Strategies are needed that can achieve measurable and predictable reductions in the export of nutrients from <b>tile</b> <b>drained</b> landscapes. The principal objectives of this project are (1) to evaluate the performance of nutrient management, drainage management, and alternative cropping systems with respect to profitability and export of water and nutrients (nitrate-nitrogen and total phosphorus) from <b>tile</b> <b>drained</b> systems and (2) to evaluate the performance of nitrate-removal wetlands in reducing nitrate export from <b>tile</b> <b>drained</b> systems.
