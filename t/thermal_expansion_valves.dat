40|$|The survey from US Department of Energy {{showed that}} {{about one-third of}} energy {{consumption}} in US is due to air conditioning and refrigeration systems. This significant usage of electricity in the HVAC industry has prompted researchers to develop dynamic models for the HVAC components, which leads to implementation of better control and optimization techniques. In this research, efforts are made to model a multi-evaporator system. A novel dynamic modeling technique is proposed based on moving boundary method, which can be generalized {{for any number of}} evaporators in a vapor compression cycle. The models were validated experimentally on a commercial supermarket refrigeration unit. Simulation results showed that the models capture the major dynamics of the system in both the steady state and transient external disturbances. Furthermore the use of MEMS (microelectromechanical) based Silicon Expansion Valves (SEVs) have reportedly shown power savings as compared to the <b>Thermal</b> <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valves</b> (TEVs). Experimental tests were conducted on a supermarket refrigeration unit fitted with the MEMS valves to explain the cause of these potential energy savings. In this study an advanced cascaded control algorithm was also designed to control the MEMS valves. The performance of the cascaded control architecture was compared with the standard <b>Thermal</b> <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valves</b> (TEVs) and a commercially available Microstaq (MS) Superheat Controller (SHC). The results reveal that the significant efficiency gains derived on the SEVs are due to better superheat regulation, tighter superheat control and superior cooling effects in shorter time period which reduces the total run-time of the compressor. It was also observed that the duty cycle was least for the cascaded control algorithm. The reduction in duty cycle indicates early shut-off for the compressor resulting in maximum power savings for the cascaded control, followed by the Microstaq controller and then the <b>Thermal</b> <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valves...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} is to develop and demonstrate an integrated, on-line performance monitoring and diagnostic system with low cost sensors for air conditioning and heat pump equipment. Automated fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) has the potential for improving energy efficiency along with reducing service costs and comfort complaints. To achieve this goal, virtual sensors with low cost measurements and simple models were developed to estimate quantities that would be expensive and or difficult to measure directly. ^ A virtual refrigerant charge sensor (VRC) was extended with three approaches for determining refrigerant charge for equipment having variable-speed compressors and fans. Three different virtual refrigerant mass flow (VRMF) sensors were evaluated for estimating refrigerant mass flow rate. The first model uses a compressor map that relates refrigerant flow rate to measurements of condensing and evaporating saturation temperature, and inlet temperature measurements. The second model uses a compressor energy balance with the power consumption from a virtual compressor power (VCP) sensor and energy heat loss model, which is relatively independent of compressor and expansion valve faults that influence mass flow rate. The third model was developed using an empirical correlation for <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> (TXV) and electronic expansion valves (EEV) based on an orifice equation. To assess the impact of faults on system performance, capacity, efficiency, and operating cost were evaluated using data for units tested in the laboratory and for data obtained from manufacturers. The impacts of faults were used in deciding thresholds for the FDD demonstration system. Information about capacity, power consumption, and energy efficiency can be used in real-time monitoring of the economic status of equipment and for decision support. ^ The complete diagnostic FDD system was implemented and demonstrated for a rooftop air conditioner (RTU) that incorporates integrated virtual sensors and fault impact evaluation for decision support. The FDD RTU demonstration system provided the following diagnostic outputs: 1) loss of compressor performance, 2) low or high refrigerant charge, 3) fouled condenser or evaporator filter, 4) faulty expansion device, and 5) liquid-line restriction. The tests also quantified the benefits of this technology with measurements of equipment performance and demonstrated implementation with low sensor costs. ...|$|E
5000|$|A <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> is a {{key element}} to a heat pump; the cycle that makes air conditioning, or air cooling, possible. A basic {{refrigeration}} cycle consists of four major elements, a compressor, a condenser, a metering device and an evaporator. As a refrigerant passes through a circuit containing these four elements, air conditioning occurs. The cycle starts when refrigerant enters the compressor in a low-pressure, moderate-temperature, gaseous form. The refrigerant is compressed by the compressor to a high-pressure and high-temperature gaseous state. The high-pressure and high-temperature gas then enters the condenser. The condenser converts the high-pressure and high-temperature gas to a high-pressure liquid by transferring heat to a lower temperature medium, usually ambient air.|$|R

A split-system direct-expansion air conditioner was used to empirically determine temperature and return-air humidity indicators that could detect performance degradation resulting from degraded conditions. The air conditioner test bench was equipped with the ability to use either a short-tube orifice (STO) or a <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> (TXV). The degraded conditions studied include low evaporator airflow, high and low-charge, and a blocked condenser coil. The work presented in this thesis is experimentally based which could identify degraded effects that fall outside of a simulation-based approach. It sought to utilize only low-cost temperature sensing means, although return-air humidity was an important factor for obtaining early detection over a wide range of operating conditions. It was empirically based rather than model based to reduce computation time with a real-time processor. Further, the current work differentiated between a system that uses a shorttube orifice (STO), or fixed-orifice expansion, and a system that uses a <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> (TXV), or variable-orifice expansion. This thesis shows that low-cost temperature sensors could be used to detect the degraded conditions studied. However, it is also shown that indicators of low evaporator airflow depend on three loading factors; outdoor-air temperature, return-air temperature, and return-air humidity. In the literature, the humidity sensing point has been neglected by automated detection systems for failures and degraded conditions of low-tonnage air conditioners. The effects of the loading factors on the indicators relative to improper charge and a blocked condenser coil were not studied.

50|$|The vapor-compression uses a {{circulating}} liquid refrigerant as {{the medium}} which absorbs and removes {{heat from the}} space to be cooled and subsequently rejects that heat elsewhere. Figure 1 depicts a typical, single-stage vapor-compression system. All such systems have four components: a compressor, a condenser, a <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> (also called a throttle valve or metering device), and an evaporator. Circulating refrigerant enters the compressor in the thermodynamic state known as a saturated vapor and is compressed to a higher pressure, resulting in a higher temperature as well. The hot, compressed vapor is then in the thermodynamic state known as a superheated vapor and it is at a temperature and pressure at which it can be condensed with either cooling water or cooling air flowing across the coil or tubes. This is where the circulating refrigerant rejects heat from the system and the rejected heat is carried away by either the water or the air (whichever may be the case).|$|R

The internal heat exchanger is so named since {{it is a simple}} heat exchanger that is placed internally into the AC system.

The work investigates how other performance parameters such as the pressure drops, IHX capacity, evaporator capacity, coefficient of performance and the absolute efficiency ratio change from the introduction of the IHX. The steady-state simulation results are compared to data available in the literature and transient experimental tests including the cabin cool-down, and the simulation results from the New European Driving Cycle. The results from the simulations show a reduction in power consumption of up to 2 % in high ambient temperatures but an increase in power consumption of up to 1. 5 % for low ambient temperatures.

Inside the unit is a compressor of the same type as in an air conditioner. The compressor compresses a gas (or mixture of gases) into a liquid. Then, the liquid is pumped up to the processor, where it passes through a condenser (heat dissipation device) and then an expansion device to vaporize the fluid; the expansion device used can be a simple capillary tube to a more elaborate <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve.</b> The liquid evaporates (changing phase), absorbing {{the heat from the}} processor as it draws extra energy from its environment to accommodate this change (see latent heat).

The experimental facility consisted of four major components: compressor, evaporator, <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve,</b> and condenser. An evaporative cooling unit was located upstream from the condenser. Thermal parameters, such as relative humidity, dry bulb temperature, and wet bulb temperature were measured to evaluate the effect of in-direct evaporative cooling on the system COP. The results indicated an inverse relation between the condenser inlet dry bulb temperature and the COP. The changes in specific enthalpy of the air across the evaporative cooled condenser were due to latent heat transfer and sensible heat exchanges, whereas the specific enthalpy changes for the conventional condenser were primarily caused by sensible heat exchanges. By using the evaporative cooling condenser to pre-cool the air, the saturation temperature drop through the condenser increased from 2. 4 °C to 6. 6 °C. It also resulted in an increase of the mass flow rate of refrigerant into the evaporator; this mass increase of liquid entering the evaporator consequently resulted in the increase of COP from 6. 1 % to 18 %. A power reduction up to 14. 3 % on the compressor was also achieved. Under partial load conditions, the DEC system showed a 20 % less COP reduction compared to the conventional system.

Existing methods and tools require system specific models or manufacturer?s map models that are not easily available to energy auditors. The proposed automated fault detection and diagnostic device for unitary air conditioners overcomes these challenges. It uses 7 surface temperature and 2 pressure sensors, with easily obtainable information to detect refrigerant undercharge, refrigerant overcharge, liquid line restriction, condenser fouling and evaporator fouling faults, and also predict the related energy and cost saving for each fault. It generates ?features? from the sensor inputs that are sensitive to the fault, but less sensitive to operating conditions. The fault detection rules are based on whether a set of features are High, Low or Normal in comparison to the thresholds. Multiple fault detection is achieved by first checking for charge related faults and then checking for fouling faults in presence or absence of the charge related faults.

Â Machines are typically rated for the weight of ice produced over a 24 hour period at ambient air temperatures of 90 Â°F and water inlet temperature of 70 Â°F. These cubers typically utilize an air-cooled, vapor-compression cycle to freeze circulating water flowing over an evaporator grid. Â Once a sufficient amount ice is formed, a valve switches to enable a harvest mode, where the compressorâ€™s discharge gas is routed into the evaporator, thereby releasing ice into a storage bin. Â The U. S. Department of Energy has set a target of reducing energy usage by 10 â€“ 15 % by 2018. Â Engineering models are not publicly available to assist designers in achieving the new energy regulations. This paper presents an engineering simulation model that addresses this need. Â This model simulates the transient operation of a cuber ice machine based on fundamental principles and generalized correlations. Â The model calculates time-varying changes in the system properties and aggregates performance results {{as a function of}} machine capacity and environmental conditons. Â Â Rapid â€œwhat ifâ€ analyses can be readily completed, enabling engineers to quickly evaluate the impact of a variety of system design options, including the size of the air-cooled heat exchanger, finned surfaces, air / water flow rate, ambient air and inlet water temperature, compressor capacity and/or efficiency for freeze and harvest cycles, refrigerants, suction/liquid line heat exchanger and <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> properties. Â Simulation results from the model were compared with the experimental data of a fully instrumented, standard 500 lb capacity ice machine, operating under various ambient air and water inlet temperatures. Key aggregate measures of the ice machineâ€™s performance are: (1) cycle time (duration of freeze plus harvest cycles), (2) Energy input per 100 lb of ice, and (3) Energy usage during 24 hours. Â For these measures, the modelâ€™s accuarcy is within 5 % for a variety of operating conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this project was to {{investigate}} and compare the performance of an R 410 A air conditioner to that of an R 22 air conditioner, with specific interest in performance at high ambient temperatures at which the condenser of the R 410 A system may be operating above the refrigerant's critical point. Part 1 of this project consisted of conducting comprehensive measurements of thermophysical for refrigerant R 125 and refrigerant blends R 410 A and R 507 A and developing new equation of state formulations and mixture models for predicting thermophysical properties of HFC refrigerant blends. Part 2 of this project conducted performance measurements of split-system, 3 -ton R 22 and R 410 A residential air conditioners in the 80 to 135 F (27. 8 to 57. 2 C) outdoor temperature range and development of a system performance model. The performance data was used in preparing a beta version of EVAP-COND, a windows-based simulation package for predicting performance of finned-tube evaporators and condensers. The modeling portion of this project also included the formulation of a model for an air-conditioner equipped with a <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> (TXV). Capacity and energy efficiency ratio (EER) were measured and compared. The R 22 system's performance was measured over the outdoor ambient temperature range of 80 to 135 F (27. 8 to 57. 2 C). The same test range was planned for the R 410 A system. However, the compressor's safety system cut off the compressor at the 135. 0 F (57. 2 C) test temperature. The highest measurement on this system was at 130. 0 F (54. 4 C). Subsequently, a custom-manufactured R 410 A compressor with a disabled safety system and a more powerful motor was installed and performance was measured at outdoor temperatures up to 155. 0 F (68. 3 C). Both systems had similar capacity and EER performance at 82. 0 F (27. 8 C). The capacity and EER degradation of both systems were nearly linearly dependent with rising ambient outdoor ambient test temperatures. The performance degradation of R 410 A at higher temperatures was greater than R 22. However, the R 22 and R 410 A systems both operated normally during all tests. Visual observations of the R 410 A system provided no indication of vibrations or TXV hunting at high ambient outdoor test conditions with the compressor operating in the transcritical regime...|$|R
40|$|R 410 A {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{refrigerants}} used for air conditioning and heat pump systems in residential applications. It has zero ozone depletion potential but its global warming potential is about 2, 000. In China and Japan, refrigerant R 32 (GWP = 675, zero ODP) has been proposed, as possible replacement for R 410 A but this refrigerant is slightly flammable. HFO- 1234 yf is a refrigerant with low GWP (GWP = 4, zero ODP) that is currently being used in European car market as a possible replacement for R 134 a. The direct impact on the environment of these two refrigerants might be gauged based on their low GWP but a measure of their indirect contributions on greenhouse gasses effects is still an open question. Having a low GWP might not be sufficient to reduce the overall environmental impact if the energy performance of the heat pump system is significantly penalized. In addition, considerable amount of engineering and manufacturing work might be necessary for developing new components that are fit to work with these low GWP refrigerants. This paper focuses on an experimental comparison of the drop-in energy performance and capacities of refrigerants R 32 and R 1234 yf in a R 410 A heat pump split system for ducted HVAC in residential applications. The experiments were conducted in a large scale psychrometric chamber at Oklahoma State University and on a 5 ton heat pump unit that was commercially available. The experiments were conducted for cooling and heating modes of the unit and the outdoor temperature was varied from 17 F (- 8 C) to 115 F (46 C). Cooling tests at AHRI standard rating conditions were performed and the refrigerant charge was optimized. Two additional conditions were considered with high outdoor temperatures of 110 F (43 C) and 115 F (46 C) to analyze the condenser pressure and discharge temperature of the refrigerant when the unit run at extreme high ambient off-design conditions. The paper highlights some challenges related to R 32 and R 1234 yf and discusses an optimization of the <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> when these refrigerants are directly retrofitted in the unit. It was observed that the COP was higher for both R 32 and R 1234 yf as compared to R 410 A with some peculiar behavior at very high temperatures, for which R 32 COP was lower than that for R 410 A. The capacity for refrigerant R 1234 yf was 40 to 50 % lower and the management of the charge as well as the adjustments of the TXV was problematic without any additional modification to the system...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. An experimental study was conducted to quantify the effect of several installation items on the high outdoor ambient temperature performance of air conditioners. These installation items were: improper amount of refrigerant charge, reduced evaporator airflow, and return air leakage from hot attic spaces. There were five sets of tests used for this research: two of them for the charging tests, two for the reduced evaporator airflow, and one for the return air leakage tests. For the charging tests, the indoor room conditions were 80 'F (27. 8 'C) dry-bulb and 50 % relative humidity. The outdoor conditions ranged from 95 'F (350 C) {{all the way up to}} 120 'F (48. 9 'C). Charge levels ranged from 30 % undercharged to 40 % overcharged for the short-tube orifice unit. For the <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> (TXV) unit, charge levels ranged from- 36 % charging to + 27 % charging. Performance was quantified with the following variables: total capacity, energy efficiency ratio (EER), and power. The performance of the orifice unit was more sensitive to charge than it was for the TXV unit. For the TXV unit on the - 27 % to + 27 % charging range, the capacity and EER changed little with charge. A TXV unit and a short-tube orifice unit were also tested for reduced evaporator airflow. As evaporator airflow decreased, the capacity and EER both decreased as expected. However, the drop was not as significant as with the charging tests. For the extreme case of 50 % reduced evaporator airflow, neither unit's capacity or EER dropped more than 25 %. Return air leakage from hot attic spaces was simulated by assuming adiabatic mixing of the indoor air at normal conditions with the attic air at high temperatures. Effective capacity and EER both decreased with increased return air leakage. However, power consumption was relatively constant for all variables except outdoor temperature, which meant that for the same power consumption, the unit delivered much lower performance when there was return air leakage. The increase in sensible heat ratio (SHR) with increasing leakage showed perhaps the most detrimental effect of return air leakage on performance, which was the inability of the unit to absorb moisture from the environment...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> valves: {{internally}} or externally equalized. The difference between externally and internally equalized valves is how the evaporator pressure affects {{the position of the}} needle. In internally equalized valves, the evaporator pressure against the diaphragm is the pressure at the inlet of the evaporator, whereas in externally equalized valves, the evaporator pressure against the diaphragm is the pressure at the outlet of the evaporator. Externally equalized thermostatic <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> compensate for any pressure drop through the evaporator.|$|R
40|$|With the {{electricity}} consumed by air-conditionings increasing sharply {{and the vast}} popularization use of natural gas in our country, the investigations on natural gas engine-driven heat pump (GHP) are now come in for people’s attention. The GHP is an equipment that can provide heating in winter and cooling in summer, which uses natural gas engine as source of power, and makes fully use of waste heat of engine and environment energy of low quality. The GHP has the advantages of high efficiency, low charge, energy saving and environment protection, in favor of reforming the balance of electricity and gas. It can be applied in small and medium-sized shopping malls, hotels, office buildings, entertainment sites, hospitals, residences, schools, and those locations using air-conditionings. The technology of GHP is relatively mature in several developed countries such as Japanese, America, and some European countries, and the application is also very prevalent. In our country, the GHP has not acquired enough recognition, due to many restrictions such as energy policy, technology and economy environment, energy supply status and price. To accelerate the process {{of research and development}} in China, this paper conducted a general theoretical investigation on the GHP. The main contents of this paper are as follows: According to the equipment developed by our laboratory and Haier Group, an integrated mathematic model of natural gas engine-driven heat pump was established, which laid the foundation for character analysis and optimum matching of the system. Though it is a new-style installation providing heating and cooling, the main components (engine, compressor, heat exchanger, and so on) of GHP have developed for many years, and the research of foundational theories is quite integrated. According to these theories, the GHP was simulated through establishing the numerical models of main components. The model of GHP is composed of two parts, namely engine and heat pump model. The model of engine also contains exhaust gas heat exchanger. The model of heat pump is made up of four parts, including scroll compressor, <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve,</b> condenser and evaporator. Using the mathematical model, the runtime characteristics of natural gas engine were simulated and analyzed by changing the parameters such as advance ignition angle, compression ratio, and excess air ratio, which provided bases for optimum design and control of natural gas engine. The results of simulation indicate that the primary energy ratio (PER) of the GHP is obviously higher than other conventional heating and cooling equipments, and the part load performance of the GHP is excellent. The characteristic analysis and optimum matching of the GHP are main study objects of this paper with computer simulation as main tools. The methods and conclusions may be helpful for investigation and design of the GHP. 随着电力空调引发的电力危机和天然气在我国的广泛使用，以天然气驱动的燃气热泵逐渐受到重视。燃气热泵（GHP）是以燃气发动机为动力源，充分利用发动机废热以及低品位环境热量，实现冬季采暖、夏季制冷的空调供热装置。燃气热泵空调具有机组效率高，制热能力强，运行费用低，节能环保的优点，有利于改善电力与燃气的峰谷平衡，可广泛应用于中小型商场、宾馆、办公楼、娱乐场所、医院、住宅、学校等需要空调的场所。燃气热泵技术在日本、美国及欧洲等发达国家已比较成熟，应用也非常普遍。在我国，由于受到能源政策、技术经济环境、能源供应状况及价格等因素的制约，燃气热泵技术直到近年才得到一定的重视。 本文对燃气热泵进行了较为全面的数值模拟研究，旨在推动该技术在国内的研发及推广应用。主要研究内容如下： 以本实验室和海尔集团合作开发的燃气热泵机组为原型，建立了燃气热泵各部件及总系统的数学模型，利用该模型，对系统性能进行了模拟计算与分析，为后续的优化匹配及智能控制研究奠定了基础。燃气热泵虽然是一种新型的供热空调装置，但其所用的主要部件（发动机、压缩机、换热器等）都经过了多年的发展完善，基础理论研究亦相当完备，具有完整的基础理论体系。燃气热泵仿真是以这些基础理论为依据，通过对各主要部件建模，并将各部件模型有机耦合，联立求解，实现对整个装置性能的模拟。 燃气热泵仿真模型由两大部分构成，即发动机模型和热泵模型。其中发动机部分还包括烟水换热装置；热泵模型包括涡旋式压缩机、热力膨胀阀、冷凝器、蒸发器 4 个子模型。利用该数学模型，对天然气发动机的性能进行了模拟计算，研究了点火提前角、压缩比、过量空气系数等参数对发动机性能的影响，为天然气发动机的优化设计和控制提供了理论依据；对整个机组的性能进行了研究，结果表明燃气热泵的一次能源利用率高于其它常用的供热空调装置，并且具有良好的变容量调节能力和优越的部分负荷性能。 本文以计算机仿真为主要研究工具，以性能分析、优化匹配为主要研究目的，所采用的方法和得出的结论可供燃气热泵研究和设计时参考...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an approach for identifying critical model parameters in dynamic air-conditioning systems using limited sensor information. The <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> {{model and the}} compressor model parameters {{play a crucial role}} in the system model's accuracy. In the past, these parameters have been estimated using a mass flow meter; however, this is an expensive devise and at times, impractical. In response to these constraints, a novel method to estimate the unknown parameters of the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> model and the compressor model is developed. A gray box model obtained by augmenting the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> model, the evaporator model, and the compressor model is used. Two numerical search algorithms, nonlinear least squares and Simplex search, are used to estimate the parameters of the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> model and the compressor model. This parameter estimation is done by minimizing the error between the model output and the experimental systems output. Results demonstrate that the nonlinear least squares algorithm was more robust for this estimation problem than the Simplex search algorithm. In this thesis, two types of <b>expansion</b> <b>valves,</b> the Electronic <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valve</b> and the Thermostatic <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valve,</b> are considered. The Electronic <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valve</b> model is a static model due to its dynamics being much faster than the systems dynamics; the Thermostatic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> model, however, is a dynamic one. The parameter estimation algorithm developed is validated on two different experimental systems to confirm the practicality of its approach. Knowing the model parameters accurately can lead to a better model for control and fault detection applications. In addition to parameter estimation, this thesis also provides and validates a simple usable mathematical model for the Thermostatic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{method to}} {{determine}} the condensing temperature set point of air-cooled refrigeration system with an electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> was discussed in this paper. This set point is fixed for a specific system {{and is based on}} the flow characteristic of the installed electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> in variant opening and pressure drop. As common sense, at constant differential between condensing pressure and evaporating pressure, larger opening of <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> allows more refrigerant flowing through the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> into evaporator. This feature offers an opportunity to lower the condensing temperature via increasing opening of <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> to enhance refrigeration efficiency and in the same time designed cooling capacity can be maintained at low ambient temperature. In this case it is supposed that the installed electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve’s</b> capacity was larger than the evaporator’s, and in fact that occurs frequently in refrigeration system designing. The benefits of this method could include: the capacity of electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> is fully utilized, the refrigeration system will operate at a lower condensing pressure and the power consumption of compressor can decrease, hence the improvement of system efficiency is predictable...|$|R
