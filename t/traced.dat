40|$|Abstract. A {{software}} module is an abstraction of a program: {{it has a}} well defined functionality, operations by which the environment accesses the program, and outputs. <b>Traces</b> are sequences of operations. <b>Trace</b> assertions constitute a particular formalism for abstract specification of {{software module}}s. Certain <b>traces</b> are identified as canonical, and all <b>traces</b> are grouped in equivalence classes, {{each of which is}} represented by a unique canonical <b>trace.</b> <b>Trace</b> equivalence captures the observational indistinguishability of <b>traces.</b> A rewriting system transforms any <b>trace</b> to its canonical equivalent. A module can often be conveniently described by a (finite or infinite) automaton. In this paper we consider only deterministic connected automata.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to improve the use of the hardware resources of the <b>trace</b> cache mechanism, reducing the implementation cost with no performance degradation. We achieve that by eliminating the replication of <b>traces</b> between the instruction cache and the <b>trace</b> cache. As we show, the <b>trace</b> cache mechanism is generating a high degree of redundancy between the <b>traces</b> stored in the <b>trace</b> cache and those built by the compiler, already present in the instruction cache. Furthermore, code reordering techniques like the software <b>trace</b> cache arrange the basic blocks in a program so that the fall-through path is the most common, effectively increasing this <b>trace</b> redundancy. We propose selective <b>trace</b> storage to avoid <b>trace</b> redundancy between the <b>trace</b> cache and the instruction cache. A simple modification of the fill unit allows the <b>trace</b> cache to store only those <b>traces</b> containing taken branches, which can nor be obtained in a single cycle from the instruction cache.
