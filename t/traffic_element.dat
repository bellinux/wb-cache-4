This came to a head in 1976 when Nottingham rejected plans for new urban highways in favour of another (later also rejected) scheme to place access restrictions on cars entering the city centre. Instead, authorities' efforts were put to work improving the forecasting models, adjust local traffic management to squeeze more out of the current road system, directing heavy lorries away from minor roads, or subsidising public transport, which was now carrying fewer passengers and becoming uneconomic. The roads programme was scaled back to half its previous size mainly because of poor public finances, and urban regeneration became much more locally driven through [...] "Strategic Plans". Although many public policies and transport planners have promoted the creation of capacity-oriented solutions, organisations such as The Urban Motorways Committee (1972) adopted the need to respect the urban fabric. This movement has developed into a recognition of the need to effectively manage the demand for transport.|$|E

However, accident type is defined in Finland by the involved <b>traffic</b> <b>elements</b> and police judgement of the accident, while in Sweden the judgement is based on registered involved <b>traffic</b> <b>elements</b> and their movements during the accident. Although the accident types did not match perfectly, the Swedish types could be modified into the Finnish equivalent. The modifications were based largely on the involvement of unprotected road users.|$|R

40|$|Today, {{there are}} a number of {{techniques}} like simulations which are used to study how various elements affect the speed of cars in urban streets. Gathering the data required to feed such techniques is a costly and time consuming process. In this paper a new method, so called "The adjustment " is presented which uses only the total travel times and volumes in streets to estimate the effect of all traffic elements on a car's speed. This technique considers a buffer around any given <b>traffic</b> <b>element</b> and estimates the value of the elements such that the total travel times and volumes are fulfilled. The technique proposed was tested in many Tehran streets using available traffic data. The elements used were bus stops, pedestrian paths, and decelerators. The results suggested that the presented method requires much less data, though giving similar accuracy compared with the traditional techniques. In addition, this method can be used to anticipate the speed using GIS taking into account the parameters studied...|$|E
40|$|All roadways, bike lanes, parking lots, {{and private}} parking areas are {{designated}} for drivers using painted line stripes. This line striping {{is an important}} <b>traffic</b> <b>element</b> for safety and the proper flow of vehicles. These lines have to be repainted for various reasons such as expansion and line changes, which make it necessary to remove the existing line stripes in advance. However, the current line stripe removal process is both labor intensive and time consuming, if it employs a conventional grinding type machine. The necessary manual tasks involve various dangers, including traffic accidents and {{the explosion of the}} harmful gas that is used for finalizing the removal process. Accordingly, an automatic line stripe removal system was developed in order to improve this line stripe removal process. But previous studies have remained on the basic research stages, confirming the potential for this automatic line stripe removal system. Therefore, this study is aimed at improving the system and process used in the traditional line stripe removal system. Also, this study is aimed at enhancing performance and features of the previous system and developing the concept for an automated system to improve the line stripe removal efficiency.

The aim was to collect data which {{will make it possible}} to describe, analyse and try to explain the changes in the number killed in traffic over the period 1996 - 2005. Previously it was possible to observe long term changes {{on the basis of a}} breakdown by state/ municipal road management authorities and a breakdown by accident type. This was no longer possible after the introduction of a new accident data system in 2003. In this project, an alternative breakdown and description of the development in the number killed is proposed. For each individual year (1996 - 2005) a "collision matrix" is constructed. This matrix shows which road user categories have been killed and whether this has occurred without a collision (single vehicle accident) or in collision with some other <b>traffic</b> <b>element.</b> Breakdowns by "urban/rural", sex and age group are also made in the matrix. Both the assessment of the police and the definition of urban areas by Statistics Sweden SCB have been used as regards the urban/rural breakdown.

40|$|Measuring and {{influencing}} social forgivingness; An {{investigation of}} the observability of social forgivingness in relation with behaviour in different traffic environments. This report further details social forgivingness using two different angles. First we will go into the possibilities of investigating the observability of social forgivingness using the research question: To which extent can social forgivingness be determined {{on the basis of}} observable behaviours? Secondly, we will also make a first attempt to investigate social forgivingness with respect to content. Here the emphasis is on the influence of the setting of the traffic task on (expressions of) social forgivingness. The corresponding research question is: To which extent do differences in setting influence expressions of social forgivingness? For this study, the differences in setting were operationalized as differences in {{the extent to which the}} setting is controlled or regulated. The interaction between road users can to a greater or lesser extent be explicitly controlled by <b>traffic</b> <b>elements.</b> When many <b>traffic</b> <b>elements</b> (e. g. markings, traffic lights) have been applied, we call the setting ‘more controlled’. Conversely, when few <b>traffic</b> <b>elements</b> have been applied, we speak of a 'less controlled' setting. In this study we have often used Shared Space locations. In this study the emphasis was on the possibilities of investigating social forgivingness. Based on a survey of different research methods, we have chosen a combination of methods: an explorative observation study and a questionnaire study (a so-called Situational Judgement Test) with a more experimental design. The different methods complement each other and therefore give a more reliable and more complete picture than if only one method were used. On the basis of literature studied, we have also selected speed, distance, viewing behaviour, gestures and priority behaviour as possibly useable operationalizations of social forgivingness...|$|R

In Turkish urban streets, there is not widely applied traffic calming projects by local authorities. On the other hand, <b>traffic</b> calming <b>elements</b> can be used effectively in Turkish urban streets in order to solve traffic-related community problems. Since, the most important objectives of traffic calming are to provide equity in residential streets, and to make them more liveable places. The case study focused on the application of the <b>traffic</b> calming <b>elements</b> in two residential streets which are used for cut-through traffic. By comparing the aplied traffic calming projects, by identifying advantages and disadvantages of <b>traffic</b> calming <b>elements</b> and problems of the case study streets in terms of cultural and spatial constraints, a look-up table was constituted. According to this table, the most suitable <b>traffic</b> calming <b>elements</b> were suggested in order to discourage cut-through traffic and to decrease traffic volume on the streets. At the end of the study, survey showed that traffic calming is very foreign concept for the residents in the study site.

The field of construction and building a multistory car park is not yet developed in Slovenia, therefore {{anyone who wants to}} start constructing that type of a structure is left on its own. Main {{purpose of this paper is}} to collect and process knowledge in field of constructing <b>traffic</b> <b>elements</b> and leading <b>traffic</b> flows in parking structures, that can help introduce architect and other planners with the basic problems regarding this field. The quality of multistory car parks is defined by level of service they offer.

Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified a microtubule-associated protein, tumor overexpressed gene (TOG) 2, as an hnRNP A 2 binding partner. The C-terminal third of TOG 2 is sufficient for hnRNP A 2 binding. TOG 2, the large protein isoform of TOG, is the only isoform detected in oligodendrocytes in culture. TOG coimmunoprecipitates with hnRNP A 2 present in the cytoskeleton (CSK) fraction of neural cells, and both coprecipitate with microtubule stabilized pellets. Staining with anti-TOG reveals puncta that are localized in proximity to microtubules, often at the plus ends. TOG is colocalized with hnRNP A 2 and A 2 RE-mRNA in trafficking granules that remain associated with CSK-insoluble tissue. These data suggest that TOG mediates the association of hnRNP A 2 -positive granules with microtubules during transport and/or localization...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Driving {{assistance}} systems are essential technologies to avoid traffic accidents, reduce traffic jams, and solve environmental problems. Not only observable behavioral data, but also unobservable inferred values {{should be considered}} to realize advanced driving {{assistance systems}} that are adaptable to individual drivers and situations. For this purpose, Bayesian networks, which are the most consistent inference approach, have been applied for estimation of unobservable physical values and internal states introduced for convenience’s sake. Nevertheless, only a few reports have addressed prediction of future states of driving behavior. This paper proposes predicting driving behavior {{in the near future}} through a simple dynamic Bayesian network, which is a hidden Markov model or a switching linear dynamic system. The proposed predictors were examined with real data. We focused on prediction of the future stop probability at an intersection because {{it is one of the}} most important maneuvers for safety to avoid collision with other <b>traffic</b> <b>elements</b> (i. e. other vehicles and pedestrians) at an intersection.
