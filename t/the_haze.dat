5|$|At around 19:30, von Spee ordered Dresden and Leipzig {{to launch}} a torpedo attack against the damaged British armored cruisers. Dresden {{increased}} speed to position herself off the British bows, and briefly spotted Glasgow as she was withdrawing, but the British cruiser disappeared in <b>the</b> <b>haze</b> and gathering darkness. Dresden then encountered Leipzig; both ships initially thought the other was hostile. Dresdens crew was loading a torpedo when the two ships confirmed each other's identity. By 22:00, Dresden {{and the other two}} light cruisers were deployed in a line that searched unsuccessfully for the British cruisers. Dresden had emerged from the battle completely unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on Titan {{could become}} far more {{habitable}} {{in the far}} future. Five billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a red giant, its surface temperature could rise enough for Titan to support liquid water on its surface, making it habitable. As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, <b>the</b> <b>haze</b> in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect {{on the surface and}} enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create a habitable environment, and could persist for several hundred million years. This is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life to spawn on Earth, though the presence of ammonia on Titan would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.|$|E
5|$|Cöln was {{assigned}} to patrols off the island of Heligoland at the outbreak of World War I in early August 1914, as the flagship of Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass. At the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914, the German patrol forces were attacked by superior British forces, including five battlecruisers and several light cruisers. Cöln was initially stationed {{in support of the}} forces on the patrol line. She attempted to reinforce the beleaguered German forces, and encountered Vice Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers. She was hit several times by the battlecruisers' large-caliber guns, but managed to escape in <b>the</b> <b>haze.</b> She inadvertently turned back toward them, however, and was quickly disabled when the battle resumed. The crew abandoned Cöln, but German vessels did not search the area for three days, and only one man survived.|$|E
40|$|This {{qualitative}} thesis investigates a socialization {{process through}} {{the rite of}} passage (initiationrites) within hazing. By gathering data of nine semi-structured interviews with engineering andsocial science students, they explained their own experiences, participating in the hazingprocess at their own universities. The main {{purpose of this study}} is to gain a deeperunderstanding of <b>the</b> <b>hazing</b> period. This study supplies information about individual’sexperiences from hazing. In order to provide a deeper knowledge and understanding of thehazing process, sociologist Erving Goffman and theorist Michel Foucault, provide researchwhich shall be used to analyze <b>the</b> <b>hazing</b> phenomenon. <b>The</b> empirical result shows that there is a polarization between engineers and social scientistsattitude towards <b>the</b> <b>hazing</b> process. <b>The</b> engineers mostly believe that hazing is an overall funactivity, and they consider the non-participating students of <b>the</b> <b>hazing</b> process as being odd. Most of the engineers are also passionate and engage in <b>the</b> process of <b>hazing,</b> which has ledthese individuals into getting involved within <b>the</b> <b>hazing</b> ritual. Some of these engineers haveeven become mentors for <b>the</b> new incoming <b>hazing</b> participants. When it comes to this study’ssocial scientists they have a different impression of hazing. They argue that <b>the</b> <b>hazing</b> processat <b>the</b> university is characterized by a hierarchical punishment role playing game, which someof these student have a negative attitude towards. In the study’s empirical section anddiscussion, the theoretical concepts are being deductively linked to the study’s researchquestions and main goal of this study. In conclusion, the study’s results indicate that there aresome obstacles to social cohesion by being a participant as well as a non-participant in thehazing ritual.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} a radar-activated integrated <b>hazing</b> {{system for}} <b>the</b> protection of waterfowl at large contaminated ponds at a power plant. <b>The</b> <b>hazing</b> devices in <b>the</b> system included acoustic alarm calls, pyrotechnics and chemical repellents dispersed {{in the form}} of a bird tear-gas.

Over the course of a year, we documented that waterfowl were 12. 5 times less likely to fly over <b>the</b> <b>hazed</b> contaminated ponds relative to a non-hazed control pond. Of the waterfowl that did fly over both ponds, the likelihood of landing on <b>the</b> <b>hazed</b> contaminated pond was 4. 2 times less relative to <b>the</b> control. <b>Hazing</b> also altered <b>the</b> flight direction and altitude of waterfowl. Mortality during <b>the</b> year <b>the</b> <b>hazing</b> system was in place decreased by a factor 6. 5 relative to previous years where the system was not in operation.

5|$|Taking the bait, the {{following}} day Howe attacked again, but his attempt to split the French fleet in half was unsuccessful when his lead ship, HMS Caesar, failed to follow orders. Much damage was done to both fleets but the action was inconclusive, and the two forces again separated without having settled the issue. Howe had however gained an important advantage during the engagement by seizing the weather gage, enabling him to further attack Villaret {{at a time of}} his choosing. Three French ships were sent back to port with damage, but these losses were offset by reinforcements gained {{the following}} day with the arrival of Nielly's detached squadron. Battle was postponed during the next two days because of thick fog, but when <b>the</b> <b>haze</b> lifted on 1 June 1794, the battle lines were only 6miles (10km) apart and Howe was prepared to force a decisive action.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{round of}} gunfire killed only the Emperor, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded Grand Duchess Maria, Dr Botkin and the Empress' maidservant, Demidova. At {{that point the}} gunmen {{had to leave the}} room because of smoke and toxic fumes from their guns and plaster dust their bullets had {{released}} from the walls. After allowing <b>the</b> <b>haze</b> to clear for several minutes, the gunmen returned. Dr Botkin was killed, and a gunman named Ermakov repeatedly tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, but failed because jewels sewn into the boy's clothes shielded him. Ermakov tried to stab Alexei with a bayonet but failed again, and finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head. Yurovsky and Ermakov approached Olga and Tatiana, who were crouched against the room's rear wall, clinging to each other and screaming for their mother. Ermakov stabbed both young women with his 8-inch bayonet, but had difficulty penetrating their torsos because of the jewels that had been sewn into their chemises. The sisters tried to stand, but Tatiana was killed instantly when Yurovsky shot her {{in the back of her}} head. A moment later, Olga too died when Ermakov shot her in the head.|$|E

5|$|Lion was hit twice more, {{during what}} came to be called the 'Run to the North', after the German battlecruisers made their own turn north. Beatty's ships {{maintained}} full speed to try to put some separation between them and the High Seas Fleet and gradually moved out of range. They turned north and then northeast to try to rendezvous with {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet. At 5:40pm they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers. The setting sun blinded the German gunners, and they could not make out the British ships and turned away to the northeast at 5:47. Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east, further away from the Germans. By 6:35 Beatty was following the 3rd BCS as they were steering east-southeast, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their southwest. A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° starboard turn, and Beatty lost sight of them in <b>the</b> <b>haze.</b> At 6:44 Beatty turned his ships southeast and to the south-southeast four minutes later searching for Hipper's ships. Beatty took this opportunity to recall the two surviving ships of the 3rd BCS to take position astern of New Zealand and then slowed down to eighteen knots and altered course to the south to prevent himself from getting separated from the Grand Fleet. At this moment Lions gyrocompass failed, and she made a complete circle before her steering was brought under control again. At 6:55 Scheer ordered another 180° turn, which put them on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet, which had altered course itself to the south. This allowed the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer's T, and they badly damaged his leading ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180° turn at 7:13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap into which he had sent them.|$|E

50|$|In {{an article}} by Hank Nuwer, a {{professor}} of journalism and an author of books on <b>hazing,</b> he compared <b>the</b> <b>hazing</b> rituals of fraternities to cults. Nuwer talks about <b>the</b> aspects of <b>hazing</b> that make <b>the</b> pledge {{keep coming back to}} the fraternity and the ramifications of dropping out. Nuwer consulted with a professor in psychology, Margaret Thaler Singer, to get {{a better understanding of the}} characteristics of cults to relate those behaviors with fraternity hazing. Nuwer believes that hazing, along with a cult, is a “’systematic’ manipulation and coercion to effect ‘psychological and social influence’” (Nuwer, B7). The first aspect Nuwer wrote about was “’enforced dependency’” (Nuwer, B7). He talked about how <b>the</b> <b>hazing</b> process where fraternities make their pledges stay at the house the whole time, keeping them sleep deprived and cutting them off from daily activities makes them dependent on their fraternity. Even though the pledges may fall behind in school or lose friends outside of their fraternity, the fraternity convinces the pledge that after <b>the</b> <b>hazing</b> ceases; it will all be worth it. This reassurance keeps the pledges coming back, reliant on the people who are hazing them; relating to the next aspect of “’family’” (Nuwer, B7). Fraternities continually tell their pledges they are joining a family. This aspect appeals to most college freshman that are having a hard time making friends in a different environment. Last, Nuwer discussed how fraternities “make it hard for their members to leave” (Nuwer, B7). He says that those who decide not to join after being hazed have already given up so much for the fraternity that they feel alone and may even experience post-traumatic stress. Nuwer gives solutions to hazing in fraternities including stronger repercussions for those involved in <b>the</b> <b>hazing</b> and that colleges should become more intertwined with the Greek community to learn about hazing and to stop it.|$|R

25|$|Unfortunately, <b>the</b> <b>haze</b> {{returned}} {{again in}} late September when Muslim Malaysians were experiencing Ramadan. This was {{partly due to}} a change of wind direction towards the southwest, partially caused by Typhoon Xangsane. The worst hit place was Kuching. The Sarawak state government had declared that schools would close if the API breaches the 300 mark. The worst affected area in Peninsular Malaysia is Johor Bahru which recorded an API of 150 on 7 and 8 October. For now, many people are wearing masks to prevent themselves from inhaling excessive amounts of haze. On 7 October, visibility in parts of East Malaysia fell to 300metres. On or about 9 October, the worst of <b>the</b> <b>haze</b> in Peninsular {{seemed to be in}} the state of Negeri Sembilan, where visibility in Sepang fell briefly to 500metres and the API in Nilai reached 198, before the rain relieved <b>the</b> <b>haze</b> partially.

Sarawak has started cloud seeding attempts to try to encourage rainfall that will help relieve <b>the</b> <b>haze.</b> Each cloud seeding session costs at least RM50,000 (roughly US$14,000).
