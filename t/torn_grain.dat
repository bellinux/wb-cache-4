40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{evaluated the}} planing performance of bamboo scrimber boards at three feed speeds and three cutting depths and used two methods {{to assess the}} finished surfaces. A macroscopic grade assessment was made according to ASTM D 1666 - 87 for visible planing defects. The other assessment was a microscopic scale roughness test measuring surface average roughness in terms of GB/T 12472. The visible {{results showed that the}} finished surface quality of bamboo resulted mainly in Grades and, with the main defect being <b>torn</b> <b>grain.</b> The two evaluations method showed consistent results in surface quality that the highest percentage of Grade was counted and the lowest roughness value occurred. Compared with the hardwood Sawtooth oak widely used in furniture industry in China, planning quality of bamboo scrimber board is better in terms of roughness...|$|E
30|$|One of the {{purposes}} of wood cutting is to obtain satisfactory machined surface. The machined surface of good quality is considered to be formed when the workpiece is cut exactly at the path of the cutting edge, meaning that the workpiece above the path of the edge is completely removed and no machining defects such as <b>torn</b> <b>grain,</b> fuzzy grain, or any other destructions would be found. In addition, as Scholz et al. [1] mentioned, no compressed cells should be found on and beneath the surface, since they may absorb moisture and swell, causing rough surface. Some studies have been done observing both the machined surface and subsurface structure; although the workpiece was cut at a plane normal to the machined surface to be observed with microscope, so the procedure was destructive and might have changed shapes of cells observed [2 – 4].|$|E
30|$|Some {{studies have}} {{investigated}} relationship of chip types to the resultant cutting force [15, 16], although {{the relation between}} the types and surface quality is not deeply discussed in these studies. Franz [12, 13] mentioned that the machined surface produced in type II chip formation is so-called of good quality. However, Franz has not conducted type 0 chip formation and it is unknown whether type II is superior or not to type 0 in terms of the surface quality. McKenzie et al. [17] conducted both inclined and orthogonal cutting, and found that changes in the occurrence of chip type induced by the inclination affect the surface quality. However, only the occurrence of defects such as raised grain or <b>torn</b> <b>grain</b> on the surface has been checked in their study, so it is uncertain whether the compressed cells, which Scholz et al. [1] mentioned, appear or not on and beneath the machined surface of each chip type.|$|E
25|$|Oyster {{mushrooms}} are parboiled in salted boiling water, slightly pressed to squeeze water, <b>torn</b> by their <b>grain,</b> and seasoned. Dried shiitake {{mushrooms are}} soaked in lukewarm water, {{and if a}} small amount of sugar is added to the water, that helps the mushrooms to rehydrate more quickly. The stipes of the mushroom are taken out, and the caps are shredded and seasoned. Green chili peppers are seeded and chopped and onions and carrots are chopped into pieces {{the same size as the}} peppers. Scallions are cut into long diagonal strips.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of the angle (θR(W)) of chip guide and the {{horizontal}} opening (h) of mouth between a chip guide and a knife edge on the occurrence of <b>torn</b> and chipped <b>grain,</b> surface quality of the workpiece, and chip discharge in planing of wood with a Japanese hand plane without a cap iron were investigated. The chip guide with a length (ℓR(W)) and an angle (θR(W)) was made, and its chip guide was equipped in the plane for this test. The depth of cut (tn) was about 0. 05 mm. The chip-guide angle (θR(W)) was changed from 64 °to 114 °and the horizontal mouth opening (h) was changed from 0. 10 mm to 3. 30 mm. The matherial used for this test was white seraya (Parashorea malaanonan Merr.) in air-dry condition. This material was planed against the grain and with the grain, at the grain angle (φ 1) of about 10 °. The results obtained were summarized in Figs. 4 (a) ～ 5 (b) and Table 4. Using the results in this paper and in the previous paper 1), 2), characteristics of the wood planing with a hand plane without a cap iron are discussed, copparing it with the wood planing with a hand plane with a cap iron...|$|R
40|$|A field-based {{study was}} {{performed}} to broaden our knowledge of industrial round-wood (IRW) losses associated with most applicable motor-manual (MM) and fully mechanized (FM) harvesting systems in Russia. Observations were made for five harvesting systems, namely cut-to-length (MM CTL and FM CTL), full-tree (MM FT and FM FT), and tree length (MM TL), during the felling, skidding/forwarding, processing, sorting, and loading operations. Damage to IRW was examined in 15 logging companies in Karelia. There were about 23 400 measured logs in 17 harvesting sites during summer and winter seasons. The damages detected were broken down into four groups: mechanical damage, processing defects, contamination with dirt, and deviations from the desired log dimensions. The results were then compared with the effective quality requirements in a given logging company, and the IRW volume loss was determined {{in terms of the}} reject rate and value loss per unit volume {{in the context of a}} harvesting system. Mechanical damage (<b>torn</b> and loosened <b>grain,</b> cuts in stemwood, and gouges made by grapples), processing defects (branches, log end splits and cracks) and contamination with dirt were the most frequent types of damage. The MMCTL and FM CTL systems provided the minimum losses (the reject rate was 2 % of observed logs and 0. 5 – 0. 6 € per m 3 of total industrial wood). The FT systems resulted in somewhat lower but still acceptable quality (MM: 4 % and € 1. 1; FM: 3 % and € 0. 9). The quality of wood harvested with the MMTL system turned out to be the lowest (5 %and € 1. 4), especially in the summer season. The total annual losses in IRW value at the companies studied were estimated as 1. 0 € per IRW m 3 or € 1. 8 million...|$|R
30|$|Statistical {{analysis}} was performed {{by means of the}} SAS package version 9.2 [34]. Raw data (in all cases) was first transformed using the rank transformation. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the variation of roughness and <b>torn</b> <b>grain</b> incidence. The sources of variation were feed speed and rake angle for planed boards, and feed speed and grit size for sanded boards. Given the number of roughness parameters studied, a principal component analysis (PCA) was first applied to data to group them into common factors and facilitate their analysis. Finally, another ANOVA was performed to assess gluing shear strength and percent wood failure between aged and unaged specimens. Given that these specimens were matched, data was analyzed considering a repeated measures design. Mean difference comparison tests were performed at 5 percent probability level when required. Simple correlation {{analysis was}} performed between surface quality parameters and shear strength and wood failure data. The normality of the data was verified using Shapiro–Wilk test.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to study the machined surface quality of Eucalyptus grandis wood submitted to heat treatment. The machining operations realized on the boards obtained from the processing of six trees were: planing, thicknessing, tear in horizontal drilling, drilling, drilling hinge and sanding. 208 boards of 125 x 25 x 500 mm were selected, with 104 untreated and 104 heat-treated boards at maximum temperature of 190 ºC. The evaluation of the surface was performed according to ASTM D- 1666 / 87 standard. The result showed that the Eucalyptus grandis wood presents a good behavior during the machining tests, obtaining notes 1 and 2 (excellent and good), except for drilling hinge test in the bolt hole and drilling with 12, 8, 6 mm, reaching notes between 2 and 4 (good, regular and bad). The heat treatment reduced the number of defects on the machined samples, except for <b>torn</b> <b>grain</b> in some machining operations...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of microbevel-shape of the knife, the amount of a gap caused by {{repairing}} botton surface, deformity of the bottom surface, and horizontal mouth opening on the occurrence of <b>torn</b> <b>grain,</b> surface quality of the workpiece, and chip discharge in planing of wood with a Japanese hand plane without a cap iron were investigated. The knife with a microbevel length (ℓR) and a microbevel angle (βR) was grinded, and its knife was equipped in the plane for this test. The depth of cut (t) was about 0. 05 mm. The microbevel angle (βR) was changed from 0 ° (conventional knife) to 60 ° and the microbevel length (ℓR) was changed from 0. 0 mm (conventional knife) to 0. 9 mm. The materials used for this test were sugi (Cryptomeria japonica), hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa), white seraya (Parashorea malaanonan), and agathis (Agathissp.) in air-dry condition. Each material was plained against the grain or with the grain, at the grain angle (φ 1) of about 3 °. The results obtained were summarized in Figs. 6 ～ 13 and Tables 8 and 9. Using these results, characteristics of the wood-planing with a hand plane without a cap iron are discussed, comparing it with the wood-planing with a hand plane with a cap iron...|$|E
30|$|Wood cutting is {{a process}} to remove the unneeded part of the {{workpiece}} as a chip to create a newly finished surface. The finished surface without defects such as <b>torn</b> <b>grain</b> or raised grain {{is considered to be}} of good quality. In the cutting process, large strain over the elastic limits may arise in the workpiece, depending on the cutting force applied by the cutting tool. Large tensile, compression, or shear strain may remain in the cell layers even after the cutting, and those cell layers are regarded as damaged. The damage near the path of the cutting edge is especially related to the defects on the surface. For example, the cells which are compressed by the cutting tool may transform into raised grain when they swell by absorbing water in atmosphere, adhesive, or finishing solvents [1]. The authors have investigated the finished surface and subsurface structure using an X-ray computed tomography (CT) system, and discussed the relation between the “Chip Type” and the damage [2]. The study indicates that the damage is closely related to the cutting condition employed, and the cutting condition which minimizes the damage should be employed for better quality of machined surface. However, the occurrence of the damage has not been discussed from the viewpoint of the two-dimensional strain distribution near the path of the cutting edge.|$|E
30|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT) {{was applied to}} non-destructive observation of machined surface and subsurface structure of hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa) produced in slow-speed orthogonal cutting. The cutting experiments were conducted under several cutting conditions and the chip formations were observed with a high-speed camera to be classified into four chip types. The difference {{in the quality of}} the machined surfaces produced in four types of chip formation was investigated. During type 0 chip formation, the workpiece was cut almost exactly at the path of the cutting edge, so no deformation was found on and beneath the machined surface. During type I chip formation, the direction of the fore-split, which is dependent on the arrangement of cells, determined the machined surface. During type II chip formation, the cutting tool sometimes tore part of the workpiece below the path of the cutting edge and the tore part was then compressed by the tool, remaining on the machined surface. During type III chip formation, part of the workpiece above the path of the cutting edge was compressed by the tool, instead of being removed as a chip, so the compression occurred in wide area. The relationship between the formation of the machining defects such as <b>torn</b> <b>grain</b> or the compressed cells and the way chip is separated, deformed, or removed was clarified in this study.|$|E

40|$|It is {{beneficial}} if the machining of wooden products is done at a moisture content {{equal to the}} climate the product {{is meant to be}} used in. For indoor products in central heated houses such moisture content is about 5 - 10 %. For planing this is often a too low moisture content showing an increased risk of poor surface quality due to severe <b>torn</b> <b>grain.</b> Contrary to this too high moisture content will result in a fuzzy grain surface and problems with swelling and shrinkage of the product. The roughness of a machined wooden surface is affected by a number of different parameters like cutting tool geometry, machine settings and wood structure. The latter is the hardest to control since the surface quality {{is a result of the}} local combination of density, grain direction and moisture content. The larger the variation in wood features the more difficult it is to find a combination of tools and machine settings that will give a high surface quality. This study showed that by wetting the surface before machining, in this case planing, the average surface quality could be increased. No time dependences could be shown, wetting short before planing did show as good improvements as wetting treatment for 30 minutes or more. The study was based on a total of 120 test surfaces of Scots pine (Pinus silvestris L.). In order to maximize the variation in grain angle and density variations the test surfaces contained both clear wood as well as green knots. Godkänd; 2015; 20150625 (micohm) </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{machining}} parameters affect {{surface quality}} and usually, wood planing process is {{heavily influenced by}} external parameters. External parameters concern mainly the machining process parameters such as: the feeding speed, the depth of cut, the cutting tool diameter and geometry, the cutting geometry, the cutting technique (up or down milling). This study was carried out to determine the planing properties of naturally grown Melunak (Pentace sp.), Dark Red Meranti (Shorea sp.) and Rubberwood (Hevea brasiliensis). Some machining defects such as fuzzy grain, <b>torn</b> <b>grain</b> and chip marks often occur in lumbers at the planing process and it decreases the machining yield. To understand and optimize the planing characteristics of this wood species, a series of experiments were carried out using a weinig Unimate 23 E moulder (cutter-head rpm of 6000, cutter diameter 120 mm) to produce machined surface with differing depth of cut ranging from 0. 8 to 2. 4 mm, by altering the feed rate from 8 to 16 m min - 1 according to ASTM D 1666 - 87. Based on the preliminary results of this study, the best results were obtained at 0. 8 mm of depth of cut and feed rate of 8 m min - 1 for Dark Red Meranti. While, the poorest results was on Melunak wood at 2. 4 mm of depth of cut and 16 m min - 1 of feed speed. This research also revealed {{that the combination of}} feed rate, depth of cut and wood species used had no significant effect on the surface quality of samples...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research work was to improve cutter usage management of a vertical-shaft cutting machine for rubberwood furniture industry. The milling cutter used consists of six-straight teeth mounted on the vertical-shaft of a milling machine. A pre-cut rubberwood specimen had the height of 40 mm and outer curve length of 330 mm. The steps of study were (1) studying the current cutter usage management of a factory through studying the important factors of current manually cutting such as specimen feed, cut depth, and cutting speed. (2) Developing the process for improvement of cutter usage management via studying sanding time and roughness after sanding with the coarse and fine size grits of sand paper number 100 and 180, respectively which the furniture factories normally apply; setting-up the surface roughness requirement for a cut-part application; studying a suitable cutting condition for part machining by controlling the cutting factors, and also determining the tool life that provided the cut-surface roughness equivalent to the roughness sanded by the sand paper number 100; and finally, developing the method for improvement. The study found that (1) the specimen feed {{had a significant effect}} on tool life. The higher feed caused a decreased tool life and an increased cut surface roughness; (2) the cutter was used to cut the specimen until the cut surface of specimen was <b>torn</b> <b>grain</b> or specimen could not be machined. Consequently, all the cut specimens had to be sanded by coarse and fine sanding, and the total time was 16. 2 sec/piece; and (3) the method developed was setting the tool life which was equal to the accumulated machining time performing the cut-surface roughness of 8 μm equivalent to the roughness sanded by using the size grit number of 100. It could eliminate coarse sanding operation. Therefore, the total sanding time remarkably decreased from the existing 16. 2 sec/piece to 6. 1 sec/piece or 62. 2 % reduction of existing time...|$|E
