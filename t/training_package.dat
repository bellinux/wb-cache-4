40|$|This paper/presentation {{reports on}} a {{commissioned}} strategic evaluation undertaken for the Australian National Training Authority on the qualitative impact of the introduction of <b>Training</b> <b>Packages</b> on vocational education and training clients. The research involved collecting the views of over 200 vocational education and training practitioners, bureaucrats, industry personnel and students from all Australian States and Territories. The data collected provides a snapshot of conflicting views about <b>Training</b> <b>Packages.</b> An activity theory approach was used to analyse the data. This resulted {{in the identification of}} key contextual issues which act against the adoption of <b>Training</b> <b>Packages</b> and their innovative use by VET practitioners. These issues are systemic in nature and provide an explanation for the polarity of views which, inevitably, result from any discussion of <b>Training</b> <b>Packages.</b> It is less than six years since the move to <b>Training</b> <b>Packages</b> as the national specification of vocational education and training (VET) in Australia and less than five years since the first <b>Training</b> <b>Packages</b> were endorsed.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I explore the way {{language}} {{is used in}} <b>Training</b> <b>Packages,</b> and the impact this language has when <b>Training</b> <b>Packages</b> are used to support work-based vocational programs. <b>Training</b> <b>Packages</b> are a fundamental component of the regulatory framework of the national vocational education and training (VET) system [in Australia]. The national strategy for VET places employers and individuals at the centre of VET, and policy commitments to access and equity are enshrined in the auditable standards of the Australian Quality Training Framework (AQTF). Yet <b>Training</b> <b>Packages</b> and related official VET texts are written in an abstract, generalised and complex language form which acts as an insurmountable barrier to many people at {{the front line of}} VET. My PhD research (a work in progress) explores the proposition that this language form is representative of, and constructive in, unequal power relationships. Early data analysis suggests that VET practitioners and training participants talk about their experience of this language in terms of power and exclusion. In contrast, the official VET response generally leaves the official language form above challenge, and instead largely focuses on the presumed deficient language and literacy skills of those who are excluded by these texts. <br /...|$|R

Research on effective teacher practices is packaged into programs designed to improve teacher effectiveness. Teachers are being trained how to control a classroom; how to teach thinking; how to motivate students; and how to teach academic content through atomistic, objectivized materials, and behaviors. Furthermore this process is rationalized by the current reform movement to professionalize teaching. Professionalism is a social project that appeals to all persons engaged in a particular work activity. To be considered a professional carries status and power. Teachers are not immune to this process. The {{purpose of this study is}} to elucidate the effects of <b>training</b> <b>packages</b> on the professionalization of teaching. This study utilizes an analytic inductive approach incorporating ethnographic interviews of educational personnel who have been <b>trained</b> through <b>packaged</b> programs, analysis of covert and overt content of <b>training</b> <b>packages,</b> and a comparative critical analysis of professionalism. The process is contextualized within a social reproduction framework. It is concluded that there are contradictions between professionalism as defined in the literature and the professionalism mediated through <b>packaged</b> teacher <b>training.</b> The overt content of teacher <b>training</b> <b>packages</b> provide a knowledge base that is inconsistent with the knowledge base requirement of a professional. Teachers are becoming educationists. Acceptance of this naive consciousness is facilitated through the covert content of collegial cohesiveness in teacher <b>training</b> <b>packages.</b> This whole process is necessary to maintain a societal identity in light of the tremendous socioeconomic changes...|$|R

40|$|In Australia, all {{vocational}} {{education and training}} (VET) qualifications {{must be based on}} competency-based training (CBT) and <b>training</b> <b>packages.</b> Yet, since 2005, there has been a major expansion in the number of VET international students in Australia, 85 % of whom are from Asia. Given this development, the teaching and learning contexts in which competency-based <b>training</b> and <b>training</b> <b>packages</b> are located are becoming increasingly diverse and no longer reflect the traditional training characteristics and boundaries that apply for domestic students. This paper examines the relevance of <b>training</b> <b>packages</b> and CBT for teaching international students in the Australian VET sector.

The discussion of the findings aims to assist the VET sector create a curriculum framework that supports flexibility, adaptation and responsiveness so that international students&# 039; divergent and shifting study purposes and complex learning characteristics can be catered for effectively.
