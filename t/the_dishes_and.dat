5|$|In November 1909, Kenyatta {{left home}} and {{enrolled}} as a pupil at the Church of Scotland Mission (CSM) at Thogoto. He informed the British missionaries based {{there that he}} wished to learn from them. These missionaries were zealous Christians who believed that bringing Christianity to the indigenous peoples of Eastern Africa was part of Britain's civilising mission. While there, Kenyatta stayed at the small boarding school, where he learnt stories from the Bible, and was taught {{to read and write}} in English. He also performed chores for the mission, among them washing <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> <b>and</b> weeding the gardens. Several months after arriving, Kenyatta was taken ill with tuberculosis. Kenyatta was soon joined at the mission dormitory by his brother Kongo. Many of their generation were increasingly resenting the patronising way in which most of the British missionaries treated them.|$|E
5|$|When White {{retired in}} December 1999, he gave back the Michelin stars, but under Robert Reid, The Restaurant won a single star {{again in the}} 2001 and 2002 editions of the guide before closing later that year. During the course of The Restaurant's two locations, White sought to develop the {{techniques}} used in <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> <b>and</b> expand the range of food on offer. The space used at Harveys was inadequate for his plans, but with the Hyde Park Hotel location {{he was able to}} add elements which were braised or made confit. At the Oak Room, both chickens and lamb were cooked each day just for pressed juices with which to make sauces for other dishes. The Restaurant was critically acclaimed, with critics such as Michael Winner, A. A. Gill and Jonathan Meades praising the food served. As did Egon Ronay, who gave the restaurant a maximum three stars in his restaurant guide.|$|E

Meanwhile, the MDC claimed that the government was making people remove satellite dishes so that they would lack access to foreign television, but Minister of Information Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said that in fact only one war veteran had tried to make people take down <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> <b>and</b> that the government had stopped him.|$|E

25|$|Food {{and drink}} is very {{important}} to the culture of the people of Benghazi, {{as it is in the}} rest of Libya. Many of <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> <b>and</b> ingredients used are passed down as tradition from generation to generation. The main ingredients that are used in their cuisine are olive oil, garlic, palm dates, grains, and milk. These products are natural to this area, and these ingredients are very common to much of North Africa and the Mediterranean. Another tradition of Libyan culinary culture is tea. Tea from Benghazi has a uniquely thick, bitter taste. Tea drinking is a social activity that close friends and relatives usually take part in.|$|E
500|$|Angels {{on horseback}} {{should not be}} {{confused}} with devils on horseback. The latter dish, which is derived from the former, uses fruit, typically prunes or dates. American and British chefs including Martha Stewart and Martin Blunos recognise the distinction between <b>the</b> <b>dishes,</b> <b>and</b> though food writer John Ayto does too, he notes that the names have often been used interchangeably. This has been traced to a Chicago Tribune article and James Beard who [...] "insisted that angels on horseback required ham as a wrapper, and that if bacon were used, what you'd have would be devils on horseback." ...|$|E
500|$|When it came {{to writing}} [...] "Happy Working Song", Menken and Schwartz were {{directly}} influenced by the song [...] "Whistle While You Work" [...] from Disney's first full-length animated feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), with Schwartz describing [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] as a [...] "spoof" [...] and [...] "one of the funniest sequences of the film". According to Schwartz, [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] was written rather quickly, having come [...] " [...] really fast". Schwartz elaborated, [...] "'Happy Working Song' is... pretty much out of Snow White and 'Whistle While You Work' and that little thing where they do <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> <b>and</b> Dopey with the soap bubbles and everything." [...] In addition to this, [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] features references to both the musical number [...] "The Work Song" [...] and [...] "the busy little mice" [...] from Disney's Cinderella (1950), but to a significantly lesser extent. Lyrically, Schwartz decided to approach the song comically as demonstrated by its phrase [...] "Even though you are vermin." ...|$|E

500|$|Food {{was mostly}} served on plates or in stew pots, and diners would take their share from <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> <b>and</b> {{place it on}} trenchers of stale bread, wood or pewter {{with the help of}} spoons or bare hands. In lower-class {{households}} it was common to eat food straight off the table. Knives were used at the table, but most people were expected to bring their own, and only highly favored guests would be given a personal knife. A knife was usually shared with at least one other dinner guest, unless one was of very high rank or well-acquainted with the host. Forks for eating were not in widespread usage in Europe until the early modern period, and early on were limited to Italy. Even there {{it was not until the}} 14th century that the fork became common among Italians of all social classes. The change in attitudes can be illustrated by the reactions to the table manners of the Byzantine princess Theodora Doukaina in the late 11th century. She was the wife of Domenico Selvo, the Doge of Venice, and caused considerable dismay among upstanding Venetians. The foreign consort's insistence on having her food cut up by her eunuch servants and then eating the pieces with a golden fork shocked and upset the diners so much that there was a claim that Peter Damian, Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, later interpreted her refined foreign manners as pride and referred to her as [...] "...the Venetian Doge's wife, whose body, after her excessive delicacy, entirely rotted away." [...] However this is ambiguous since Peter Damian died in 1072 or 1073, and their marriage (Theodora and Domenico) took place in 1075.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{ceramics}} associated with this site, Potomac Creek Cord-impressed and Potomac Creek Sand-tempered. [...] A smoothed variety of the Cord-impressed is named Potomac Creek Plain. [...] These three types of ceramic are what <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> <b>and</b> containers were made of {{by the people of}} 44ST2. [...] Other ceramic artifacts consist of ladles/spoons, beads, worked potsherds, and human effigy figurines. [...] Many of the beads came from several of the ossuaries but also just in general context around the site. [...] Three pottery human effigy figurine heads were found, two with distinct facial features. [...] A similar ceramic head has been found at the Kiser site in Virginia.|$|E

2500|$|House kobolds usually live in {{the hearth}} area of a house, {{although}} some tales place them in less frequented parts of the home, in the woodhouse, in barns and stables, or in the beer cellar of an inn. At night, such kobolds do chores that the human occupants neglected to finish before bedtime: They chase away pests, clean the stables, feed and groom the cattle and horses, scrub <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> <b>and</b> pots, and sweep the kitchen. Other kobolds help tradespeople and shopkeepers. A Cologne legend recorded by Keightley claims that bakers in {{the city in the}} early 19th century never needed hired help because, each night, the kobolds known as Heinzelm√§nchen made as much bread as a baker could need. Similarly, bieresal, kobolds who {{live in the}} beer cellars of inns, bring beer into the house, clean the tables, and wash the bottles and glasses. This association between kobolds and work gave rise to a saying current in 19th-century Germany that a woman who worked quickly [...] "had the kobold".|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the cook-off, running {{commentary}} {{is made in}} a booth {{near the}} cooking area by an announcer, Kenji Fukui; a commentator, Yukio Hattori, {{and one or two}} of the guest judges, with one floor reporter (sometimes two; normally Shinichiro Ohta) providing details of the action on each side. The commentators and judges discuss the style of cooking, culinary traditions and unusual food preparation. At the end of the hour, after end-of-battle interviews with both competitors, each dish is presented to the camera, with a description of its properties (written by the show's screenwriters based on the chef's explanation) read by the announcer. Then, a panel of three (later expanded to four and, later still, five) judges, of which typically one is a professional critic, tastes <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> <b>and</b> judges them based on taste, presentation, and originality. [...] Each chef may be awarded up to 20 points by each judge, with ten given for taste and five each for presentation and originality. [...] The chef with the greatest score wins the competition. (In earlier four-judge episodes, the win went to the chef who won three of the four judges, or, failing that, the chef that makes the highest points total.) ...|$|E
