40|$|Pulsed plasma {{thrusters}} are low thrust propulsive devices {{which have}} a high specific impulse at low power. A pulsed plasma thruster is currently scheduled to fly as an experiment on NASA's Earth Observing- 1 satellite mission.

As part of the qualification testing of the thruster it is necessary to determine the nominal thrust as a function of charge energy. These data will be used to determine control algorithms. Testing was first completed on a breadboard pulsed plasma thruster to determine nominal or primary axis thrust and associated propellant mass consumption as a function of energy and then later to determine if any significant off-axis <b>thrust</b> <b>component</b> existed.

40|$|Two 0. 004 N thrust cesium {{bombardment}} ion thrustors {{have been}} developed and used for north-south stationkeeping in the geostationary Applications Technology Satellite- 6 (ATS- 6).

40|$|International audienceThe {{central area}} of the Ionian Islands is {{dominated}} by the existence of a major tectonic structure called the Cephalonia Transform Fault (CTF). Its main part (Cephalonia segment) has been identified by previous work based on the spatial distribution of earthquake foci, fault plane solutions of strong earthquakes, active tectonics, structural studies and geodetic measurements. This part (Cephalonia segment) which exhibits strike-slip motion with a <b>thrust</b> <b>component,</b> strikes in a northeast direction, dips to the southeast and has a length of ∼ 90 km. In the present paper information concerning new fault plane solutions, orientation of isoseismals, sea bottom topography and recent GPS results are used to further check the properties of this southern part of the CTF and to explore its northeastward prolongation to Lefkada Island. It is shown that the CTF is extended to the western coast of Lefkada. This northern branch (Lefkada segment) of the CTF which is also characterized by strike-slip motion with a <b>thrust</b> <b>component,</b> strikes in a north-northeast direction, dips to the east-southeast and has a length of ∼ 40 km.

The constrained least squares algorithm and Laplaciansmoothing were used to estimate and regularize the slip distribution. The coseismic slip model suggestedtwo nearly W-E striking segment faults breaking during the Van event. Two main slip concentrationswere found to to be located at depths ranging from 7 km to 20 km. The estimated moment reached 6. 08 × 1019 Nm (equal to an Mw 7. 19 event). A stress change analysis showed that the main shock imposedan up to ~ 5 bars stress load on the causative fault of the 9 November aftershock, implying a triggeringmechanism between the two events.

40|$|Abstract: Composite tectonic {{emplacement}} of the world’s largest outcropping body of subcontinental mantle rocks, the Ronda peridotites, {{occurred during}} Early Miocene continental subduction {{and as a}} result of oblique plate convergence. Partitioning of transpressional deformation between coeval orogen-parallel wrenching and orogen-perpendicular, pure <b>thrusting</b> <b>components</b> is recorded by shear zone kinematics and dynamothermal metamorphism in the footwall to the ultramafic rocks. Left-lateral shear, characterizing the deeper, high-pressure (eclogitic) portions of the continental subduction system, propagated through the mantle into the overlying continental crust of the overriding plate, whereas top-to-the-foreland frontal thrusting dominated at the leading edge of the hot peridotite body. Top-to-the-hinterland shear along the upper contact of the peridotites is consistent with the kinematics expected for an extrusion wedge consisting of subcontinental mantle rocks. On the other hand, coeval strike-parallel extension and thinning of the crustal rocks overlying the peridotites confirms that, similarly to other Alpine–Mediterranean examples, partitioned transpression resulted in the development of a complex deformation pattern, with kinematically linked shear zones aiding exhumation. The proposed model provides a new, coherent scenario for syn-convergence peridotite emplacement and exhumation in the western Betic Cordillera. Since the model work by Chemenda et al.
