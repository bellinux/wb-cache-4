The tested material was lCr- 0. 5 Mo- 0. 25 V ferritic steel which is commonly used as pipeline base material of steam generators in power plants.

The expected magnetization versus temperature curve for each type of Pr atom was calculated using the Brillouin function, as well as the average magnetization versus temperature curve for the entire unit cell. The results show that the “corner” atoms exhibit very different behavior from that of the other types of Pr atoms on the “center” or “edge” sites. This is due to the broken symmetry in exchange interaction at the corner site due to interactions with atoms from outside the unit cell that are in closer proximity than atoms within the unit cell.

The films are deposited onto glass substrates by high vacuum evaporation at pressures better than 10 (^- 6) torr and are protected by an over coating of silicon monoxide. The resistivity has been examined between 4. 2 K and room temperature; the magnetoresistance has also been studied in the presence of applied transverse fields up to 15 KOe and longitudinal fields up to 10 KOe. The variation of resistance with temperature is similar in form to that obtained for bulk specimens for all film thicknesses. However, in films less than about 400 A thick, the spin-disorder resistivity shows a pronounced decrease in magnitude but the degree of variation {{did not appear to be}} consistent with thickness. The spin-disorder resistivity is obtained by computing a least-squares fit to the linear high temperature part of the resistance curve and extrapolating to 0 K. The results show that in the temperature region where spin-wave theory is applicable, at very low temperatures pspin ɚ T(^ 2) in accordance with spin-wave theory but at higher temperatures, this falls off, so that It is found that pspin ɚ T(^ 2) in the first case, the variation of Pspin(T) can be better explained in terms of an anisotropy energy gap and the change to a T(^ 3 / 2) proportionality has been related to the behaviour of the spontaneous magnetization and the anomalous Hall effect. In addition, the variation of pSpin of dysprosium is examined in detail and it is suggested that the observed fall off of spin resistivity with thickness, which can be extrapolated to zero at zero thickness, is related to <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnetization</b> with thickness in the film.

40|$|Spin-orbit torque in a {{magnetic}} domain wall was investigated by solving the Pauli-Schrödinger equation for the itinerant electrons. The Rashba interaction considered {{is derived from}} the violation of inversion symmetry at interfaces between ferromagnets and heavy metals. In equilibrium, the Rashba spin-orbit interaction gives rise to a torque corresponding to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. When there is a current flowing, the spin-orbit torque experienced by the itinerant electrons in a short domain wall has both field-like and damping-like components. However, when the domain wall width is increased, the damping-like component, which is the counterpart of the non-adiabatic spin transfer torque, decreases rapidly. In contrast to the non-adiabatic spin transfer torque, the damping-like spin-orbit torque does not approach to zero in the adiabatic limit.
