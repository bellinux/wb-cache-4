50|$|In {{the first}} quarter of 2008 alone, credit rating {{agencies}} announced 4,485 downgrades of CDOs.

5000|$|According to New York Times {{business}} journalist Joe Nocera, synthetic CDOs {{expanded the}} impact of US mortgage defaults. Prior {{to the creation of}} CDS and synthetic CDOs, you could have only as much exposure to non-prime mortgage bonds as there were such mortgage bonds in existence. At their peak, approximately $1 trillion in subprime and Alt-A mortgages were securitized by Wall Street. However, with the introduction of the CDS and synthetic CDOs, exposure could be amplified since mortgage bonds could be [...] "referenced" [...] by an infinite number of synthetic CDOs, as long as investors agreed to take {{the other side of the}} bet. For example, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission Report found that more than $50 million notional amount of credit default swaps in Synthetic CDOs referenced <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>rated</b> BBB tranche of the one mortgage-backed security — [...] "CMLTI 2006-NC2" [...] — which had an initial principal amount of only $12 million. This was just one of many low rated tranches that was referenced by multiple CDS that later defaulted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Pitch angle {{control of}} wind turbine {{has been used}} widely to reduce torque and output power {{variation}} in high rated wind speed areas. It {{is a challenge to}} maximize available energy in <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>rated</b> wind speed areas. In this paper, a wind turbine prototype with a pitch angle control based on fuzzy logic to maximize the output power is built and demonstrated. In the varying low rated wind speed of 4 - 6 m/s, the use of fuzzy logic controller can maximize the average output power of 14. 5 watt compared to 14. 0 watt at a fixed pitch angle of the blade. Implementation of pitch angle fuzzy logic-based control to the wind turbine is suitable for <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>rated</b> wind speed areas.

40|$|The {{amount of}} wind power which the wind turbine can produce is {{dependent}} on the wind speed region. To optimize wind turbine power, a pitch angle of the wind turbine’s blade needs to be determined. In the high rated wind speed region, the pitch angle need to be controlled to reduce torque and output power variation. In <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>rated</b> wind speed region, it is a challenge to maximize available energy. In this paper, a wind turbine is developed for <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>rated</b> wind speed in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia. Based on the characteristic of power coefficient of the wind turbine and the data profile of wind speed for the last three years, the pitch angle position was determined. It is shown that the wind turbine has its maximum power coefficient at a fixed pitch angle position of 16. 8 o for every wind speed below 10 m/s or low rated wind speed. A total power production of 216. 98 kWh/year can be produced at the pitch angle position of 16. 8 o and a total power production> 200 kWh/year for the pitch angle position of 13. 1 to 20 o. It is suggested that the wind turbine has a good tolerance of pitch angle position. This wind turbine is suitable for <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>rated</b> wind speed region and a potentially low cost which can be operated at a fixed pitch angle position of the wind turbine’s blade.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{purpose of}} this study was to assist the {{development}} of an improved technical teacher education program. Specifically, the project sought to determine what, if any, factors in the backgrounds of successful technical teachers may have accounted for their success in teaching. To provide information to this end, the investigation sought answers to the following questions: 1. What is the family status of successful technical teachers? 2. What is the nature of the successful technical teacher's industrial experience? 3. Is there a definite educational background pattern that characterizes the successful technical teacher? 4. Do the teaching loads of the successful teachers differ from those of the less successful instructors? 5. Do high success teachers receive higher salaries than do low success teachers? 6. Does the successful technical teacher belong to community and professional organizations? 7. Are successful technical teachers interested in art, music, literature, and social sciences? 8. Do successful technical instructors agree in their curriculum recommendations for technical teacher education? Procedures: Directors of technical education in 354 post-secondary institutions in 44 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, were requested to evaluate each of their full-time technical instructors, having a minimum of two years of teaching experience. The 354 schools represented all of the institutions in the United States and its territories, conducting full-time, post- secondary, technical education programs in 1963 under Title VIII of the National Defense Education Act. The evaluation instrument was based upon staff evaluation forms currently used in most large school systems. The participants in the study were selected on the basis of their evaluation scores. The instructors with high scores (top 22 percent) constituted the high success group, while <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>rated</b> instructors (bottom 22 percent) served as the low success group. Technical instructors in both groups were contacted by mail. They were requested to complete a comprehensive questionnaire dealing with four distinct categories; educational background, current teaching activities, interests, and recommendations for a technical teacher education curriculum. The questionnaire returns were tabulated by the Oregon State University Computer Center. The mean responses of the two groups to each of the questions were compared and analyzed. Responses that indicated significant differences between the two groups were further studied and evaluated. A summary of the findings is herewith reported. Selected Findings: 1. The high success instructors generally attended state universities while the low success group was more likely product of other 4 -year institutions. 2. The high success teachers had more advanced degrees in Education among them than there were among the low success group. 3. The average high success instructor had more students in his classes than the low success teacher. 4. The average high success instructor earned 2, 636 more per year than the low success teacher. 5. The average low success instructor had 1. 2 years more teaching experience than the high success teacher. 6. The average low success instructor had 4. 1 years more industrial experience than the high success teacher. 7. No significant difference was found between the two groups as to completed teacher education course work or inservice preparation. 8. No significant variance was found between the two groups in their family status, major teaching fields, and the age at which they started teaching...|$|E
40|$|The {{roots of}} the 2008 {{financial}} crisis are often {{traced back to the}} collapse of the housing bubble. The factors that precipitated the crisis, and propagated its effects on firms and consumers to produce an economic contraction, are still the subject of ongoing debate among academics, policy makers, and practitioners. Macroeconomic factors, flawed government policies, and perverse incentives at financial institutions that lead to excessive risk taking are often cited as contributing forces to the crisis. In this dissertation, I investigate two forces that drove the 2008 financial crisis. One force is the credit rating agencies, whose excessively generous ratings lie {{at the root of the}} 2008 financial crisis. The popular claim is that the rating agencies have become too loose at their rating assignments, which led to overestimation of the creditworthiness of the companies by the public. In this dissertation, I examine the assertion that the rating companies have progressively relaxed their standards in recent decades for corporate credit ratings. Such relaxation seems to have lulled investors into a false sense of security about the safety of credit instruments whose values collapsed abruptly. Next I examine the contagion effects of rating downgrades. I ask whether rating downgrade news have spill over effects on the rest of the industry. I then investigate a different force that has received less attention in the crisis; investor confidence. The third essay focuses explicitly on the period when the financial crisis was at its peak. In Essay 1 titled, "Structural Shifts in Credit Rating Standards", I examine the time series variation in corporate credit rating standards for the period 1985 - 2007. I report two main findings: (i) There is a divergent pattern between investment grade and speculative grade rating standards during 1985 - 2002. Investment grade ratings tighten between 1985 and 2002. In contrast, the speculative grade rating standards loosen during the same period. Consistent with an agency explanation, rating companies assign more issuer friendly ratings to speculative grade credits, where there is substantial growth by the first-time entrants. The loose standards in speculative grade ratings are consistent with widespread criticism of the rating agencies during the Dot-Com crash. However, while the media focused on failure of rating agencies in high profile corporate debacles, the more serious problem was in the speculative grade rating assignments. (ii) There is a sharp structural break in both investment grade and speculative grade standards towards more stringent ratings around 2002. The change in rating levels due to the structural break is both economically and statistically significant. Holding firm characteristics constant, firms experience a drop of 1. 5 notches in ratings due to tightening standards between 2002 and 2007. It appears that widespread criticism and threat of regulation led rating agencies to move towards more conservative ratings after the Dot-Com crash, Enron debacle and passage of Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In Essay 2 titled "Contagion Effects of Rating Downgrade Announcements", we examine the intra-industry spill over effects of rating downgrade announcements based on abnormal returns for stock and CDS spreads of competitor industry portfolios. We find minor contagion effects for the equity prices of the industry portfolios for the entire sample. For the competitors of investment grade firms, we find significant contagion effects in the magnitude of - 15 basis points for the window (0, 1). For the speculative grade sample, we do not observe contagion or competition effects although this result can be due to cancellation of contagion and competition effects for <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>rated</b> firms. These results suggest that the net effect is dependent on the event firm's original rating. We find statistically significant CDS reaction of industry portfolios to downgrade news although in moderate magnitudes. The cross sectional tests show that the industry portfolio equity response and event firm equity response are positively correlated. This finding presents further evidence of contagion effects for rating downgrades. Essay 3 discusses a different force that has received less attention in the financial crisis, investor sentiment, and focuses on data drawn from the crisis period. In Essay 3, titled "Confidence and the 2008 Financial Crisis", we examine the role of confidence in the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis using new high frequency data on daily closed-end fund discounts and novel measures of consumer sentiment from non-financial sources extracted at daily frequency. Empirically, there is some movement in sentiment through much of the crisis period but it is relatively moderate. However, tests detect a sharp structural break around the Lehman bankruptcy, after which there are breaks in both pricing across multiple asset classes and co-movement, especially in hard-to-arbitrage fund classes. Fund discounts also exhibit significantly increased co-movement with non-financial Gallup sentiment measures after the Lehman bankruptcy, and closed-end fund discount betas with respect to the market increase significantly during this period. While fund discounts may reflect liquidity issues in normal conditions, they seem to better reflect sentiment in stressed environments, so funds have undesirable conditional betas. The results are consistent with the view that the Lehman bankruptcy induced a negative shock to the supply of arbitrage capital, and as predicted by behavioral finance models of costly arbitrage, sentiment then matters more and is closely tied to returns. The results are also consistent with theories of financial crisis in which sentiment or confidence is an extra force that amplifies and transmits economic shocks that add to the usual credit and collateral mechanisms studied in the literature...|$|E
