Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training together and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> helped loosen things up a little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day. That's a good way to find your way 'into it' [...]" ...|$|E

[...] Warrel Dane attributes the sound of the album to the challenges that the band members faced during this period: [...] "Enemies Of Reality was a difficult album to make.

Parker has [...] "always {{been in love}} with the wall of sound as employed by My Bloody Valentine" [...] and he tries to capture that [...] "melancholy dreamy feel". Parker tries to incorporate this balance into his own music. [...] "If I was singing, I wouldn't be able to match the tone of the instruments, which is really crunchy. The instruments are quite sonically brutal, but the voice is really soft, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> resonates with people. It's kind of like My Bloody Valentine, where it's really brutal sounding, but kind of beautiful at the same time." [...] Tame Impala live keyboardist Jay Waston has described Parker's music as containing [...] "shoegazey guitar sound, but not played in a shoegazey manner".|$|E

Palin responded, [...] "I don't think so right now. I was surprised that the President spent time on that in his State of the Union speech when he only spent about 9 percent {{of his time in}} the State of the Union on national security issues. And I say that because there are other things to be worried about right now with the military. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> on the back burner is sufficient for now.

"Well," [...] {{said the}} American, {{closing his eyes}} for the better {{enjoyment}} of the analysis, and giving a long, slow pull at his cigar, [...] "there might have been any one of several things. My idea {{is that he was}} a defaulter, and the thousand-dollar bills--there were forty or fifty of them, Oiseau says--were part of the money he got away with. Then, very likely he had no faith in Oiseau--knew it was probably a soap-mine, and was just putting him off till he could get away himself. Or, maybe his fever left him a little cracked, and he didn't know exactly what he was about. Then, again, if my theory of what the man was is true, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> fellow gets a twist simply from what he's done.

Possibly I should have passed the photograph by had it not suggested old times to me--old times with a veil over them, for I could not identify the face. That I had at some period of my life known the original I felt certain, but I tapped my memory in vain. The lady was a lovely blonde, with a profusion of fair hair, and delicate features that were Roman when they were not Greek. To describe a beautiful woman is altogether beyond me. No doubt this face had faults. I fancy, for instance, that there was little character in the chin, and that the eyes were 'melting' rather than expressive. It was a vignette, the hands being clasped rather fancifully {{at the back of the}} head. My fingers drummed on the album as I sat there pondering; but when or where I had met the original I could not decide. The colonel could give me no information. The album was Jack's, he said, and probably had not been opened for years. The photograph, too, was an old one; he was sure it had been in the house long before his son's marriage, so that (and here the hard-hearted old gentleman chuckled) it could no longer be like the original. As he seemed inclined to become witty at my expense, I closed the album, and soon afterward I went away. I say, wake up! ...|$|E

If you read a novel in more than two weeks you dont read the novel really.

Also lyrically, it may be a bit more internalised on this one. It's kind of like painting lyrical postcards almost, touching on cultural traditions and things like that.” ...|$|E

5000|$|During the {{recording}} of the album Hiatt was still doing drugs and drinking which, he felt, diminished {{the quality of the}} album and also meant he was short on material.

According to Faryar: [...] "I think Herbie their manager steered us into some situations, like with Charlie Calello, where {{they wanted us to}} think this kind of song, they wanted us to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> song, and we did not thrive in the hands of that kind of direction.

I love the original Tales From The Darkside, The Outer Limits, and The Twilight Zone, but I think in a post X-Files world there's really no room for a straight anthology show. There has to be more. I like stories that work like puzzle boxes, every episode is turning another facet. We have something a little like that in Darkside that I am pretty excited about where you are watching it and every episode is a different story but three or four episodes in, you're going, 'Wait a minute, these parts actually all go together don't they?'
