5|$|A {{week after}} the crash, the {{families}} of various passengers aboard Flight 706 began filing lawsuits and court papers against Hughes Airwest and, later, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. The first filing was by the family of Keith A. Gabel, which filed a motion to perpetuate testimony in the Central District of California on June 16, 1971. This motion requests that the court issue a court order for a person's deposition to be taken, and can be done prior to a lawsuit being filed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.|$|E

5|$|In 1797 the Escheat Movement was born. Under {{the scheme}} {{proposed}} by the movement, land would be forfeited to the Crown should proprietors default on their quitrents, and tenants would be given the option of either purchasing part of the forfeited land or leasing it from the Crown. Members of the movement won a large majority in the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island in 1802, and in 1803 a law to implement escheat {{was passed by the}} legislature.

The survey found that almost all land was the property of just 10,000 people, or 0.2% of the population. The majority were small landlords, but the 750 richest landlords owned {{half of the country}} between them. Many of the richest were absentee landlords who lived in Britain or elsewhere in Ireland, and paid agents like Charles Boycott to manage their estates.|$|E

5|$|On taking office, Welensky {{was forced}} to take sides in the Suez Crisis. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom {{received}} heavy international criticism for its actions, but Welensky's government, with those of Australia and New Zealand, nonetheless stood behind Britain. It was Welensky's first experience in international politics.

It marked the decline of a gradual approach to decolonisation, and a rapid speeding up of the process. Politically, only three years after its founding, the federation began to decline.|$|E
5|$|The Oppenheimer {{security}} {{hearing was}} a 1954 proceeding by the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) that explored the background, actions, and associations of J.

The hearing resulted in Oppenheimer's Q clearance being revoked. This {{marked the end of}} his formal relationship with <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, and generated considerable controversy regarding whether the treatment of Oppenheimer was fair, or whether it was an expression of anti-Communist McCarthyism.|$|E
5|$|The monarch {{and his or}} her {{immediate}} family undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties.

Though the ultimate formal executive authority over <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom is still by and through the monarch's royal prerogative, these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and precedent.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, {{demand for}} a Scottish Parliament grew, in part because <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom was {{controlled}} by the Conservative Party, while Scotland itself elected relatively few Conservative MPs. In {{the aftermath of the}} 1979 referendum defeat, the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly was initiated as a pressure group, leading to the 1989 Scottish Constitutional Convention with various organisations such as Scottish churches, political parties and representatives of industry taking part. Publishing its blueprint for devolution in 1995, the Convention provided much of the basis for the structure of the Parliament.|$|E

Each man was subject to forfeiture of three months' pay. A few of them were held as witnesses in the upcoming mutiny trial. The rest were split into smaller groups and shipped out to various places in the Pacific Theater. Carl Tuggle, one of the 208, said in 1998 {{that a group of}} prisoners including himself were assigned menial tasks such as cleaning latrines and picking up cigarette butts at a series of Pacific islands. After returning from active duty they each received bad conduct discharges, which meant the loss of virtually all veterans' benefits.|$|E

Rebuilding began quickly on the hardest hit islands. However, trees and vegetation were expected to take years to recover. Despite reconstruction efforts and the small number of resort lodgings affected (around 2%), officials expected a 10%20% decline in tourism. The Bahamian Government, observing that their response mechanisms were not sufficient, reformed the National Emergency and Management Agency.|$|E
