5|$|The South Indian, Tamil name, Aravan, is popularly {{believed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> {{the word}} aravam (அரவம்) (snake). Aravan's association with snakes is also apparent in his iconography.|$|E
5|$|The English 'wolf' {{stems from}} the Old English wulf, which is itself thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the Proto-Germanic *wulfaz. The Latin lupus is a Sabine loanword. Both derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *wlqwos/*lukwos.|$|E
50|$|Many Latin verbs are denominal.

5|$|Einstein {{contributed to}} these {{developments}} by linking {{them with the}} 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> one another by a simple shifting process. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.|$|E

5|$|The {{culture of}} the islands has been {{affected}} by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse and English speaking peoples and this is reflected in names given to the islands. Most of the Hebrides have names with Scots Gaelic derivations, whilst those of the Northern Isles tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the Viking names. A few have Brythonic, Scots and even perhaps pre-Celtic roots.|$|E
5|$|The genus {{appeared}} {{some time}} in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene eras, around 24 million years ago, in the Iberian peninsula. While the exact origin of the word Narcissus is unknown it is frequently linked to its fragrance which was thought to be narcotic, and to the legend of the youth of that name who fell in love with his reflection. In the English language the common name Daffodil appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the Asphodel with which it was commonly compared.|$|E
5|$|The name Gallox is {{believed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> gallows as the village gallows were nearby, {{when it was}} called Gallocksbrigge.

5|$|Because {{of limited}} data {{concerning}} gong music prior to European exploration, theories abound {{as to when}} the prototypes {{of what is now}} the kulintang came to be. One theory suggest that the bronze gong had an ancient history in Southeast Asia, arriving in the Malay archipelago two or even three thousand years ago, making its way to the Philippines from China in the 3rd century AD. Another theory lays doubt to the former claim, suggesting the kulintang could not have existed prior to the 15th century due to the belief that Javanese gong tradition, which is what the kulintang was believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from,</b> developed only by the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{her first}} {{address to the}} legislature, Collins asked for an {{additional}} $324million from the Kentucky General Assembly, most of it allocated for education. The additional revenue was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> Collins' proposed tax package, which included increasing the income tax on individuals making more than $15,000 annually, extending the sales tax to cover services such as auto repair and dry cleaning, and increasing the corporate licensing tax. After opposition to her proposal developed among legislators during the 1984 biennial legislative session, Collins revised the tax package. She retained the corporate licensing tax increase, but replaced the sales tax and income tax modifications with a flat five percent personal income tax and phasing out the deductions for depreciation which corporations could claim on their state taxes.|$|E
5|$|The Poveiro is a {{specific}} genre of boat characterized by a wide flat-bottom and a deep helm. There were diverse boats with different sizes, uses and shapes. The most notable of which, the Lancha Poveira, was believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the Drakkar Viking, but without a long stern and bow and with a lateen sail. Each boat carried carvings, namely a sigla poveira mark for boat identification and magical-religious protection at sea. According to a tradition that persists to this day, the youngest son is the heir of the family, as in old Brittany and Denmark, because {{it was expected that}} he would take care of his parents when they became old. Women govern the family, because men were usually away from home fishing.|$|E

5|$|The name Crewkerne {{is thought}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> Cruc-aera; from the British cruc - a spur of a hill, and the Old English aera - a house, {{especially}} a storehouse. The town {{was known as}} Crocern, or Cruaern in the 899 will of Alfred the Great when he left it to his younger son Æthelweard, and by 1066 the manor was held by Edith Swanneck mistress of King Harold. After the Norman conquest it was held by William the Conqueror and the church estate {{was given to the}} Abbaye-aux-Hommes in Caen, Normandy. In the Domesday Survey of 1086 it was described as a royal manor.|$|E
5|$|Many {{minerals}} provide pigments {{which have}} been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries. Pigments, in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities. The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the emerald, which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3), is called chrome green, also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar. Copper {{is the source of the}} green color in malachite pigments, chemically known as basic copper(II) carbonate.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{from the}} 9th and 10th centuries make {{no mention of}} the Polan (Polanie) tribe. The closest thing would be the huge (400 gords) Glopeani tribe of the Bavarian Geographer, whose name seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> that of Lake Gopło, but archeological {{investigations}} cannot confirm any such scale of settlement activity in Lake Gopło area. What the research does indicate is the presence of several distinct tribes in 9th-century Greater Poland, one around the upper and middle Obra River basin, one in the lower Obra basin, and another one west of the Warta River. There was the Gniezno area tribe, whose settlements were concentrated around the regional cult center: the Lech Hill of today's Gniezno. Throughout the 9th century, the Greater Poland tribes did not constitute a uniform entity or whole in the cultural, or settlement pattern sense. The centrally located Gniezno Land was at that time rather isolated from external influences, such as from the highly developed Moravian-Czech or Baltic Sea centers. Such separation was probably a positive factor by facilitating the efforts of a lineage of leaders from an elder clan of a tribe there, known as the Piast House, which resulted {{in the early part of}} the 10th century in the establishment of an embryonic Polish state.|$|E
