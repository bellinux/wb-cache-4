5|$|The {{next three}} seasons saw mixed results for New Zealand, who won all their Tri-Nations <b>tests</b> <b>in</b> 1997 before losing the {{title for the}} first time in 1998. In 1998 New Zealand lost all five <b>tests</b> <b>in</b> the Tri-Nations and Bledisloe Cup series (two to South Africa and three to Australia), the first time they had lost four <b>tests</b> <b>in</b> {{succession}} since 1949. The following year they suffered their worst test loss, 28–7 to Australia in Sydney. At the 1999 World Cup later that year, the All Blacks dominated their pool, handing England a 30–16 defeat at Twickenham. They advanced past Scotland 30–18 in the quarter-finals to play France at Twickenham. After New Zealand finished the first half 17–10 ahead, France then produced a famous half of rugby to which New Zealand had no answer, winning 43–31. Hart subsequently resigned as coach and was replaced by co-coaches Wayne Smith and Tony Gilbert.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>testing</b> is {{critical}} <b>in</b> GSD, its application {{in this context}} has not been deeply investigated so far. This work investigates <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> GSD.

The leading question is ”What problems exist <b>in</b> <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> GSD and {{how can they be}} addressed in projects?”. Decomposing this question we a) identify problems of <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> GSD projects and b) provide good practices to support practitioners <b>in</b> <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> GSD projects. The research is realized in the context of Capgemini sd&m, a German IT provider. Our contribution to solving the stated research problem is a collection of 16 patterns for <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> GSD projects. For practitioners the usage of the patterns is simplified by various views on the patterns. Herewith we stipulate research and support project managers and <b>test</b> managers <b>in</b> the realization of <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> GSD projects. ...|$|R

5|$|Australia {{were now}} 02 down {{and needed to}} win three <b>Tests</b> <b>in</b> a row to retain the Ashes.

He then top-scored with 88 in Australia's first innings of 288 and made 55 in the second as Australia won by 148 runs in the Fourth Test in Adelaide to level the series. In the deciding Test at the MCG, McCabe scored 112, one of three centuries as Australia amassed 604, a record score in Ashes <b>Tests</b> <b>in</b> Australia.

Australia won the first by nine wickets and were 124 runs from victory with eight wickets in hand in the second when bad light stopped play. In the Third Test at Cape Town, the pair set a new Australian opening record of 233, which laid the foundation for a large Australian total and an innings victory. It was Australia's first double-century opening stand in Test cricket, and remains an Australian Test record for the first wicket against South Africa. Brown posted 121, his highest Test score at the time. He scored 34 and 84 in Australia's only innings of the Fourth and Fifth <b>Tests</b> <b>in</b> Johannesburg and Durban, making solid opening stands with Fingleton, who scored three consecutive centuries. The pair laid the platform for two further innings victories, as Australia took the five-Test series 4–0. His compiled 417 runs at 59.57 for the series. Brown scored a further four fifties in the remaining tour matches to end with 1065 runs at 62.65.|$|E
