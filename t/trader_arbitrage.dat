40|$|We use {{a stylized}} optimization/simulation model {{to study the}} {{behavior}} of crop markets in response to climate variations and climate forecasts. In the model, farmers choose area planted to each crop, consumers and stockholders arbitrage across time, and <b>traders</b> <b>arbitrage</b> across regions. Climate forecasts cause some degree of planting specialization depending on the quantity of stocks on hand and access to imports and exports. Because the elasticity of demand facing the region is inelastic, improved climate forecasts cause a decline in farm profits, but consumers gain more so net global income increases. Trade barriers diminish the incentives to respond to climate forecasts, and so dramatically reduce their value. Thus, we show in this framework that the economic activities of storage and trade are complements not substitutes for climate information...|$|R

The impact of the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards on the size and prevalence of the PEAD anomaly is examined. Unlike recent evidence for the US market we find PEAD to be alive and well, and of growing importance in our Greek sample. It may be the adoption of international financial reporting standards (IFRS) has served to reduce earnings predictability in Greece and thus enhance PEAD in the Athens stock exchange (ASE) market.

40|$|This paper uses a {{numerical}} model {{to examine the}} long-run impact of a radical liberalization of the West-European natural gas markets. We study profit maximizing Cournot producers facing an ideal third party access regime for gas transport. Producers sell gas either to large users in the manufacturing industry and to gas-fired thermal power plants, or to local distribution companies. We first examine the case where no <b>traders</b> exploit <b>arbitrage</b> possibilities and some producers have limited access to the markets. In this equilibrium net prices differ across markets. These differences disappear in the second case where traders are introduced. The third case focuses on a complete European market for natural gas in which <b>traders</b> exploit all <b>arbitrage</b> possibilities and all producers can sell gas in all markets. We also study {{the impact on the}} complete European market of changes in costs for production, transport, and distribution. Finally, welfare implications from a liberalization of the West-European natural gas markets are discussed. We argue that a radical liberalization could increase economic welfare in Western Europe by 15 % to 20 % in the long run. ...|$|R

By replicating two major arbitrage strategies using high fre-quency prices from novel datasets, this paper shows that arbitrage profits were large, persisted for months, involved borrowing dollars, arose independently {{of whether or}} not loans were secured, and waned as dollar liquidity was provided by central banks.

40|$|Transmission {{constraints}} fragment {{electricity markets}} and enhance regional market power of electricity generators. In continental Europe rights to access transmission between countries are auctioned to <b>traders,</b> which <b>arbitrage</b> separate energy spot markets of these countries. In Scandinavia the system operator integrates these markets and simultaneously clears energy spot markets of several countries and decides on optimal energy transmission. In any un-constrained or partially constrained network, integration mitigates market power of strategic generators and avoids inefficient production decisions.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of individual traders on the persistence of arbitrage opportunities, using futures market data from the Korea Composite Stock Price Index 200. The empirical results show that individual traders traded towards increasing arbitrage opportunities unlike other types of traders. This study helps explain the reason why arbitrage opportunities persist even when arbitrage trading is executed in the real world. According to our empirical results, arbitrage opportunities can persist if the behaviour of individual <b>traders</b> regarding <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities overwhelms other traders who are against arbitrage opportunities. This is not fully explained by previous studies that attributed the persistence of arbitrage opportunities to the limit to arbitrage. In this context, {{this study suggests that}} two separate arguments need to be combined for explaining arbitrage trading in the real world, namely studies of arbitrage trading and the behavioural approach. ...|$|R

40|$|What {{made the}} {{collaboration}} between the Chinese and the Europeans in the early colonial Maluku Islands different from the well-known cases in Manila and in Batavia? I think {{the answer lies in}} the nature of Dutch policy in Maluku, monopoly, and the character of Chinese trade in Maluku, arbitrage, as well as their special relationship: strange monopoly vis-à-vis elusive arbitrage. By reading both Dutch and Chinese sources, I argue that, before Coen became the Governor-General of the VOC in 1618, Chinese traders, like many other Asian <b>traders,</b> made <b>arbitrage</b> between different counterparties in the world of Maluku, such as the Dutch, the Spaniards, and the local rulers, because their rivalry distorted commodities prices in local and global markets. After Coen became the Governor-General, he initially tried to expel all of Asian traders from the Maluku Islands, but, as this policy turned out to be impractical, he chose to leave the Chinese as “regulated arbitrageurs” to replace other “unregulated arbitrageurs” in order to maintain his strange monopoly policy...|$|R

The results of both in-sample and out-of-sample specification tests support the exponential smooth transition threshold model and hence the belief that investor behaviour does differ between large and small returns...|$|R

John Maynard Keynes Arbitrage trades are {{necessarily}} synthetic, leveraged trades, as they involve a short position. If the assets used are not identical (so a price divergence makes the trade temporarily lose money), or the margin treatment is not identical, and the trader is accordingly required to post margin (faces a margin call), the trader may run out of capital (if they run out of cash and cannot borrow more) and be forced to sell these assets at a loss even though the trades {{may be expected to}} ultimately make money.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} interest among economists, political leaders and non-governmental organizations in instituting a set of currency transactions taxes (CTT) or Tobin taxes. The motivation has been two-fold: {{to raise money for}} important social purposes, such as reducing poverty in developing, combating global warming, or providing basic health care in developing nations; and reducing instability in currency markets by reducing the volume of trading. It is plausible that a well-designed CTT could serve both ends. Simple arithmetic shows that a CTT set at even a very modest rate (e. g. 0. 1 percent), could raise an enormous amount of revenue. With daily trading volume now exceeding $ 1 trillion, a 0. 1 percent tax could raise over $ 100 billion annually, even with very large decline in trading volume. Similarly, by reducing the volume of trading, it is possible that a CTT will increase the stability of currency markets. This could be the case if the traders who are discouraged by the tax are destabilizing speculators, or noise <b>traders,</b> rather than <b>arbitrage</b> <b>traders.</b> Also, reduced trading volume should facilitate effective intervention by central banks seeking to maintain stability in currency markets. However, a CTT that applies to the spot market for currency cannot possibly achieve these objectives. This paper shows that: that such a tax will be readily evaded by speculators acting in secondary markets, and that trading in secondary markets can easily move the spot market. It argues that to be effective, any CTT will have to be applied {{to a wide range of}} financial instruments. Furthermore, a broadly based financial transactions tax is socially desirable, for all the reasons that a CTT is desirable in currency markets...|$|R

We add a curvature energy term to the method and we propose an approximation technique to reduce the computational time. We apply the method and approximation technique on various market sectors of NYSE data and extract the highly correlated pairs of time series.

40|$|Extant {{empirical}} research has reported nonlinear behavior within arbitrage relationships. In this article, the authors consider potential nonlinear dynamics within FTSE- 100 index and index-futures. Such nonlinearity can be rationalized by {{the existence of}} transactions costs or through the interaction between informed and noise traders. They consider several empirical models designed to capture these alternative dynamics. Their empirical results provide evidence of a stationary basis term, and thus cointegration between index and index-futures, {{and the presence of}} nonlinear dynamics within that relationship. The results further suggest that noise traders typically engage in momentum trading and are more prone to this behavior type when the underlying market is rising. Fundamental, or <b>arbitrage,</b> <b>traders</b> are characterized by heterogeneity, such that there is slow movement between regimes of behavior. In particular, fundamental traders act more quickly in response to small deviations from equilibrium, but are reluctant to act quickly in response to larger mispricings that are exposed to greater noise trader price risk...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether {{deviations from}} a domestic spot-futures relation, as identified through mispricing series in stock index futures, spillover international boundaries. Such spillovers suggest that {{information from a}} mispricing series in one market conveys a signal of similar mispricing in another market. In the presence of <b>arbitrage</b> <b>traders</b> {{and in the absence}} of market frictions, mispricing series should be independent across international boundaries. The study employs a VAR analysis of stock index futures mispricing across three large futures markets - Australia, the UK and the USA. Using time zone differences, tests are conducted for the daily transmission of arbitrage information. The results reveal the relationship between mispricing series is bi-directional. Based on this finding, a trading strategy is employed to examine the economic significance of apparent profits. The results show that some profits are possible after transaction costs but that a long horizon, probably beyond the scope of most traders, is required to exploit the spillover information.

50|$|Hackers: Due to {{the large}} number of {{accounts}} that have to be created and managed (containing personal details such as email, name, address, ewallet, credit card information and often even a copy of the bettor's ID/passport or driver's license), <b>arbitrage</b> <b>traders</b> are highly susceptible to cyber fraud, such as bank account theft. While making deposits is usually made easy and quick, making withdrawals often requires proof of identity in the form of passport/driver license, copies of which need to be shared with the bookmakers via fax/email or even postal mail, which causes additional identity theft risks. Traders are often attracted to high odds comparison sites that yield high percentage profits per stake (5-30%); this is often used by hackers to lure a high number of arbitrage bettors that then place large sums of money on these arb's, only to lose all of the profit and even entire savings in bank accounts to hackers or untrustworthy websites, which may further use the gathered data to sell personal data to criminals.|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{issues in}} {{modeling}} foreign currencies along {{a number of}} dimensions. The extent that black market exchange rates of developing countries can be forecast is evaluated.

Similarly, the profitable expiration of call options is forecast by employing a probit model. This is the first study of this nature and {{the results indicate that}} by using observable features of the underlying exchange rate and option market, in-the-money expiration of the option can be forecast. If exchange rates can be successfully forecast, the efficiency of the market needs to be investigated. This can be done by determining if relationships that exist among several markets that should adjust to remove short term anomalies fail to do so. If markets exhibit inefficiencies long enough for <b>traders</b> to exploit, <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities are said to exist. This is evaluated and it is found that arbitrage profits are dependent upon the particular markets involved. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, the impacts of the current wave of {{globalisation}} and regionalisation on the livelihoods of informal cross-border traders have increasingly attracted scholarly interest. One of the main areas of focus is on contradictions in state policies, which are supposed to facilitate cross-border flows but have instead proved obstructive, especially to unregistered trade. However, of interest to this research is that significant numbers of the traders continue to survive {{even though they are}} seen as victims. This study is {{based on the premise that}} ethnographic research is required for a more nuanced analysis. Exploration of small-scale informal cross-border trade has revealed that although taking different forms, borders are still there and continue to benefit the better-off. At the same time, despite being marginalised, the poor continue to survive. Interestingly, it is the existence of said borders that provides the small <b>traders</b> with <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities. This research questions how the traders utilise social networks to negotiate changes in state policies and actions. While several studies acknowledge the benefits of social networks, very few, especially in Southeast Asia, have put them at the centre of studies. Ethnographic details are particularly rare. Social networks are at the heart of this study and have proved to be very important livelihood strategies of the traders. Based upon a total of nine months of ethnographic fieldwork at a border crossing between Thailand and Lao PDR and an extended field visit to several sites in Vietnam, the research shows that social networks involving kin and non-kin actors, which are established, sustained, and strengthened through daily interactions, are vital, especially under changing border landscapes. Social networks empower the traders not only to bridge the two sides of the increasingly regulated border, but also to deal with emerging risks and constraints resulting from national and global changes...|$|R
40|$|We present {{analysis}} of a unique foreign exchange data set which consists of a complete deal record for 1 month from the dominant foreign exchange electronic broking system complete with anonymized banker and trader identities. This is used to put flesh on the proposition that there is private information in foreign exchange markets. We find that, in liquid dollar exchange rates, traders who specialize their activity in that rate have the largest price impact from aggressive trading. In non-dollar cross pairs, the traders with the largest impact on prices are triangular <b>arbitrage</b> <b>traders</b> who spread their trades evenly across the three exchange rates in the relevant triangle. High volume traders of any kind also have reasonably large price impact from market orders. The same taxonomy of traders predicts that specialists and high volume traders suffer least price impact when supplying liquidity and this is verified in our analysis. Finally, we document {{the effect of a}} trader being located in a large institution on the information content of trades. Individuals located on large trading floors move prices further when they trade aggressively and suffer smaller adverse price movements when they trade passively...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{extensive}} research regarding {{the relationship between}} macroeconomic variables {{and the stock market}} is carried out. For this purpose the two largest stock markets in the world, namely the US and Japan, are chosen. As a proxy for the US stock market we use the S&P 500 and for Japan the Nikkei 225. Although there are many empirical investigations of the US stock market, Japan has lagged behind. Especially the severe boom and bust sequence in Japan is unique in the developed world in recent economic history and it is important to shed more light on the causes of this development. First, we investigate the long-run relationship between selected macroeconomic variables and the stock market in a cointegration framework. As expected, we can support existing findings in the US, whereas Japan does not follow the same relationships as the US. Further econometric analysis reveals a structural break in Japan in the early 1990 s. Before that break, the long-run relationship is comparable to the US, whereas after the break this relationship breaks down. We believe that a liquidity trap in a deflationary environment might have caused the normal relationship to break down. Secondly, we increase the variable set and apply a non-linear estimation technique to investigate non-linear behaviour between macroeconomic variables and the stock market. We find the non-linear models to have better in and out of sample performance than the appropriate linear models. Thirdly, we test a particular non-linear model of noise traders that interact with <b>arbitrage</b> <b>traders</b> in the dividend yield for the US and Japanese stock market. A two-regime switching model is supported with an inner random or momentum regime and an outer mean reversion regime. Overall, we recommend investors and policymakers to be aware that a liquidity trap in a deflationary environment could also cause severe downturn in the US if appropriate measures are not implemented accordingly...|$|R
