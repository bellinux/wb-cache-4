25|$|Life Against Death: The Psychoanalytical Meaning of History (1959; {{second edition}} 1985) {{is a book}} by American classicist Norman O. Brown, in which the author offers a radical {{analysis}} and critique {{of the work of}} Sigmund Freud, tries to provide a <b>theoretical</b> <b>rationale</b> for a nonrepressive civilization, explores parallels between psychoanalysis and Martin Luther's theology, and draws on revolutionary themes in western religious thought, especially the body mysticism of Jakob Böhme and William Blake. The result of an interest in psychoanalysis that began when Marcuse suggested to Brown that he should read Freud, Life Against Death became famous when Norman Podhoretz recommended it to Lionel Trilling. It has been compared to works such as Frankfurt school philosopher Herbert Marcuse's Eros and Civilization (1955) and philosopher Michel Foucault's Madness and Civilization (1961).|$|E

Import substitution was heavily practiced during the mid-20th century as a form of developmental theory that advocated increased productivity and economic gains within a country. This was an inward-looking economic theory practiced by developing nations after WW2. Many economists at the time considered the ISI approach as a remedy to mass poverty: bringing a third-world country to first-world status through national industrialization. Mass poverty is defined thusly: [...] "the dominance of agricultural and mineral activities – in the low-income countries, and in their inability, because of their structure, to profit from international trade," [...] (Bruton 905).|$|E

2500|$|Paul Robinson credits Brown and Marcuse with {{systematically}} analyzing psychoanalytic {{theory in}} order to reveal its critical implications and of going beyond Reich and Róheim in probing the dialetical subtleties of Freud's thought, thereby reaching conclusions more extreme and utopian than theirs. He finds Trilling's work on Freud of lesser value than the works of Brown and Marcuse. Robinson sees Brown's exploration of the radical implications of psychoanalysis as in some ways more rigorous and systematic than that of Marcuse. He notes that Life Against Death and Eros and Civilization have often been compared, but finds Brown's book more elegantly written, attributing this to Brown having a background in literature and the classics rather than philosophy and political theory. Yet while admiring the rigor and imagination of Brown's arguments, he believes that {{his analysis of the}} genesis of sexual differentiation unwittingly subverts its purpose of showing that a nonrepressive organization of sexual life is possible. Robinson argues that if tyrannical sexual organizations result from inability to accept separation or death, and if this flight from separation is in turn based on the fact of prolonged infantile dependence, then sexual repression is a biological inevitability. Brown thus, despite his objectives, offers [...] "a counsel of despair", since his analysis of sexual repression fails to offer a <b>theoretical</b> <b>rationale</b> for a nonrepressive civilization. Brown was unable to either explain the historical rise of repressive civilization or to provide a solution to the problems of modern living. He believes that while Brown's work is psychologically more radical than that of Marcuse, it is politically more timid, and fails to transform psychoanalytic theory into historical and political categories. He deems Marcuse a finer theorist who provides a more substantial treatment of Freud. He also finds the subtitle of Life Against Death, [...] "the Psychoanalytical Meaning of History", to be [...] "pompous and misleading".|$|E

The theory adds to defensive neorealists' {{argument that the}} structure of the international system constrains state behavior. Setting to rectify the status quo bias pertaining to defensive neorealism by arguing that anarchy can also generate incentives for states to maximize their share of power, offensive neorealism solves anomalies that Waltz's theory fails to explain. Mainly, the theory is able to provide an explanation for the amount of conflict occurring among states in the international system. As Snyder states, Mearsheimer's offensive neorealism [...] "enlarges the scope of neorealist theory by providing a <b>theoretical</b> <b>rationale</b> for the behavior of revisionist states".|$|E

We argue that the normative innovation policy literature tends to treats policy makers as mere translators of <b>theoretical</b> <b>rationales</b> into action, denies agency to most actors in relation to policy change, remains focused on a superficial analysis of instruments (despite a supposed emphasis on policy mixes) and treats interactions between policies as something to be designed away by better co-ordination.

The purpose of this paper is, first, to suggest that this perspective is too narrow and, second, to use principles and concepts of institutional economics to demonstrate why. In particular, I use institutional theory to develop four <b>theoretical</b> <b>rationales</b> for minimum wage legislation: imperfect competition and inequality of bargaining power; involuntary unemployment and destructive competition; efficiency and growth; and labor market externalities and social costs of labor. One revisionist implication is that a minimum wage under plausible conditions may increase economic efficiency even in a purely competitive labor market...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} firm financial distress and bankruptcy on an airline's pricing behaviour. Three <b>theoretical</b> <b>rationales</b> are set forth: the supply-side rationale suggests that the bankrupt firm's lower operating costs may result in lower prices; from a demand perspective, distressed firms' prices may be lowered in response to reduced consumer demand; and the strategic rationale then suggests that distressed firms may reduce prices and sell off inventory to generate cash for long-term survival. The hypotheses are tested by estimating price and output equations with data from the US airline industry. The results provide support for the supply-side and demand-side rationales and confirm the general contention that distressed carriers' fares are lower, all other things being equal. © 2005 LSE and the University of Bath...|$|R
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that a physician’s ability to {{independently}} and accurately self-assess is poor, that more clinical experience does not necessarily lead to better outcomes of care and that fewer than 30% of physicians examine their own performance data and try to improve.

This rule was first discovered by Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795-1878), an anatomist and physiologist, in experiments on the thresholds of perception of lifted weights. A <b>theoretical</b> <b>rationale</b> (not universally accepted) was subsequently provided by Gustav Fechner, so the rule is therefore known either as the Weber Law or as the Weber-Fechner law; the constant k is called the Weber constant. It is true, at least to a good approximation, of many but not all sensory dimensions, for example the brightness of lights, and the intensity and the pitch of sounds. It is not true, however, of the wavelength of light. Stanley Smith Stevens argued that it would hold only {{for what he called}} prothetic sensory continua, where change of input takes the form of increase in intensity or something obviously analogous; it would not hold for metathetic continua, where change of input produces a qualitative rather than a quantitative change of the percept. Stevens developed his own law, called Stevens' Power Law, that raises the stimulus to a constant power while, like Weber, also multiplying it by a constant factor in order to achieve the perceived stimulus.|$|E
