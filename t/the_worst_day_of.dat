When her husband received a job offer {{to take over the}} troubled organization responsible for the 2002 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, to be held in Salt Lake City in Utah, she urged him to accept it; eager for a new challenge, as well as another chance to prove himself in public life, he did.

[...] Mitt Romney described watching her fail a series of neurological tests as <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> his life. He later said: [...] "I couldn't operate without Ann.

[...] She initially experienced a period of severe difficulty with the disease, and later said: [...] "I was very sick in 1998 when I was diagnosed.

50|$|Lugosi {{has been}} among those who felt filmmaker Edward D. Wood, Jr. {{exploited}} his father's stardom, {{taking advantage of the}} fading actor when he could not refuse any work.

He also said it was the first penalty shoot-out he had ever won as a manager: [...] "I won the Charity Shield that way, but that doesn't really count. The European Cup? The FA Cup? The Scottish cups? Never. I've lost three with Aberdeen and three with United, so seventh time lucky — magnificent." [...] Ferguson later apologised to Park Ji-sung for not including him in the matchday squad.

[...] "There were people fearful of walking by a table where you knew you didn't belong, stuff like that. Certain groups {{certainly}} got preferential treatment across the board. I caught the tail end of one really horrible incident, and I know Dylan told his mother that it was <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> his life."
