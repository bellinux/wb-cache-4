5|$|Although {{the episode}} {{primarily}} mocks the Republican Party, the writers included several jokes {{at the expense}} of the Democratic Party, liberal and conservative politics, <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as neutral as possible. Writers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were very interested in the Watergate scandal and based a lot of the second act on that. Mark Kirkland directed the episode.|$|E
25|$|Only about 20% of North Korea's mountainous {{terrain is}} arable land. Much {{of the land}} is only {{frost-free}} for six months, allowing only one crop per year. The country has never been self-sufficient in food, and many experts considered it unrealistic <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E
25|$|In episode 6, Dylan calls Brenda {{while she}} is talking to Kelly and Ryan. When Kelly finds out it's Dylan on the line, she talks to him. It turns out that Dylan wants <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a family again with her and Sammy. However, this would mean {{they would have to}} move away from Beverly Hills. After much thought, Kelly breaks up with Ryan, as she said that she needs to try to work things out with Dylan. Ryan asks Kelly why Dylan would call Brenda's phone, not hers, if he wanted to talk to Kelly. Fearing Brenda and Dylan were {{secretly}} back together, Kelly confronts Brenda. After hearing Brenda say that her and Dylan's relationship is platonic, Brenda and Kelly make up. Kelly decides to try to repair her relationship with Dylan, while Brenda sadly deletes his number from her cell phone. It is implied {{that there may have been}} more to the story of Brenda and Dylan's relationship that she didn't share with Kelly, as Brenda shed some tears when deleting Dylan's phone number.|$|E
2500|$|In chapter {{seventeen}} of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man, {{there is}} a literary device to the Saul to Paul conversion: [...] "'You start Saul, and end up Paul,' my grandfather had often said. 'When you're a youngun, you Saul, but let life whup your head a bit and you starts <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Paul – though you still Sauls around on the side.'" ...|$|R

5000|$|Cage {{said that}} with this role, he had to switch from his regular methods of {{constant}} movements <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "effective" [...] while often still. He remarked on having to adopt the mindset of a child, and act impressed by commonplace experiences such as feeling rain or sunlight. A rig for the camera was built for the scene where the angelic Seth sees Maggie look in the mirror, and the crew shot the mirror without the actors for one take so Cage's reflection could be edited out from the take with both.|$|R
500|$|The band's main songwriter, Thistlethwayte, {{inadvertently}} wrote a [...] "break-up album", which The Sydney Morning Heralds Brett Winterford noted was unusual, [...] "that the {{articulate and}} intelligent 27-year-old has strung together 12 such stock-standard, radio-friendly songs about broken hearts". Thistlethwayte described his influences: [...] "Jazz taught me about spontaneity ... Central to jazz is improvisation. It's also great {{to get that}} knowledge of theory, {{an understanding of the}} geeky side of music" [...] and writing advertising jingles had showed him how to [...] "do {{a lot of things in}} differing genres and recording styles – but had <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> authentic about it". After writing the tracks, the other members [...] "choose the songs that had the ultimate emotional impact".|$|E
500|$|VanDerWerff deemed Spears' cameo [...] "totally useless," [...] {{criticizing the}} singer's [...] "flat, {{listless}} dialogue." [...] Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post graded her cameo a [...] "C," [...] commenting [...] "at least she didn't have <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> funny" [...] as in her How I Met Your Mother guest-spot. Flandez {{was disappointed that}} Spears did not appear for longer, yet he concluded that given the acting demonstrated in her 2002 film Crossroads, it was better that the pop star did not. Conversely, Jenna Mullins of E! Online appreciated the fact that Spears did not appear as a background character, writing that she is [...] "best when she is playing herself", Stack felt her appearances were well-handled, [...] "with a nice level of restraint," [...] and Canning felt they were kept to a [...] "perfect minimum." ...|$|E
500|$|Gjokaj {{was cast}} in the role in August 2014. [...] "He was a soldier, {{and he had been}} very active all his life, and now he has {{to figure out how to}} use his brains, how <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> smart," [...] Gjokaj {{explained}} of the character. [...] "He accepts his injury, he accepts his compromised status in society ... Peggy says, 'Forget this. I'm Peggy Carter. I'm going to do something else.' I think that's the difference between the two of them." [...] Considering a potentially romantic relationship between Sousa and Carter, Gjokaj said, [...] "I think there’s definitely a situation where … if she hadn't dated Captain America, he might ask her out for a drink. It’s like if your new girlfriend dated Ryan Gosling. It’s going to make you sweat a bit." [...] For the second season, Gjokaj said, [...] "you’ll see him deal with actually being part of the machine. Not trying to get [...] the machine, but being the boss. The first season was him trying to be listened to, and now he’s being listened to by a lot of people." [...] The costumes for the SSR agents in the series are meant to be distinctive to help explain their characters: Sousa wears [...] "sweater vests under his sport coats and pleated pants".|$|E

500|$|Avery Jessup, fiancée of Baldwin's {{character}}, {{was played}} by actress Elizabeth Banks, who first guest starred as the {{character in the}} show's fourth season. This was Banks' tenth time as the Avery character. Banks told Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly that she approached the 30 Rock staff about making an appearance as she {{is a fan of}} the show. [...] "I definitely put feelers out, like, 'I would love to be on your show.' And they did it. They made it happen! I'm a huge fan, so this is a dream come true." [...] Banks also revealed that she has no intention on becoming a series regular, explaining that she has been having [...] "too much fun" [...] making films to commit to a television show full-time. Comedian actor Will Forte made his fourth appearance in the show, having guest starred as a different character in the February 1, 2007, episode [...] "Black Tie" [...] from the show's first season. In the previous season, Forte played Jenna Maroney's boyfriend and Jenna impersonator. Forte has appeared in the main cast of Saturday Night Live (SNL), a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Tina Fey, the series creator and lead actress on 30 Rock, was the head writer on SNL from 1999 until 2006. In June 2010, Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna, confirmed that Forte would reprise his role as her boyfriend in the upcoming season. Carlock also noted in the Entertainment Weekly interview that the Jenna and Paul characters [...] "have some ups and downs. He wants <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a normal couple, and she is afraid of that level of commitment." [...] In the previous episode, [...] "Chain Reaction of Mental Anguish", Jenna and Paul break-up. In [...] "Christmas Attack Zone", the two get back together.|$|E

2500|$|Lilly {{received}} wide-scale {{media attention}} for her beliefs regarding feminism {{expressed in a}} 2014 interview with The Huffington Post: [...] "I'm very proud of being a woman, and as a woman, I don't even like the word feminism because when I hear that word, I associate it with women <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> pretend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> men, and I'm not interested in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> pretend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a man." ...|$|R
5000|$|In botanical terminology, felted {{typically}} {{is defined}} in terms such as [...] "matted with intertwined hairs". However, plants may be covered in several different ways, and several different terms have <b>been</b> coined <b>to</b> describe them. Not all textbooks use the same terms, or use {{them in the same}} way. The term felted is commonly used in describing any part of a plant covered with dense white fur, whether tangled or not. Part of the reason is that plants themselves vary so much that there seldom <b>is</b> much practical value <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too precise; for example there is no clear boundary to separate terms such as felt(ed), arachnoid, indumentum and tomentose, and usages vary.|$|R
2500|$|Now the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff can {{shape our}} {{military}} establishment to fit {{what is our}} policy, instead of having <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ready to meet the enemy's many choices. [...] That permits of a selection of military means instead of a multiplication of means, [...] As a result, {{it is now possible}} to get, and share, more basic security at less cost.|$|E
2500|$|At a later {{point in}} the season, Lisa Todorovich of Zap2it chastised Naomi for being [...] "all about herself" [...] while failing to support Liam during a series of troubles. While {{acknowledging}} Naomi's faults, which eventually lead to a break-up with Liam, Krista Navin of MassLive.com stated that [...] "it is totally consistent with her character that she would want <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there for Liam, but just be too into her own drama to really be able to be. Also, I think {{it makes sense that}} someone like Liam would think he would want to be with someone like Naomi, and then be pretty disillusioned by the reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morris {{played at}} Michigan under head coach Bo Schembechler. [...] When Morris first arrived at Michigan, Schembechler told Morris (who stood five feet, seven inches) {{he was too}} short to play at running back. [...] Schembechler recalled: [...] "I told Jamie when we {{recruited}} him he {{was too small to}} be a running back and we wanted him for running back kicks. I did, however, promise him the chance <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a running back for us. Good thing I did, isn't it?" [...] In his third game as a freshman, Schembechler put him in as the starting tailback, and he remained Michigan's starter at the position for four years.|$|E

2500|$|Despite his {{financial}} problems and bankruptcy in 1987, Gwynn remained unfazed on the field. In the Padres home opener, Marvell Wynne, Gwynn, and John Kruk hit back-to-back-to-back homers {{to start the}} game for San Diego, the first time an MLB team had led off a game with three consecutive home runs. In June, he had 44 hits in 93 at-bats for a [...]473 average, the best month in his career. He finished fifth among NL outfielders voting for the All-Star game, which Padres manager Larry Bowa called [...] "a joke". However, Gwynn was unperturbed: [...] "People put a premium on the home-run hitters. I know what I am. I’m a contact hitter and not a home-run hitter ... I’m not going <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> something I’m not." ...|$|E

The referendum was held on 23 June 2016 and the British electorate voted by 52% to 48% in favour of leaving the European Union. On 24 June, a few hours after the results became known, Cameron announced that he would resign the office of Prime Minister by the start of the Conservative Party Conference in October 2016. In a farewell speech outside 10 Downing Street, he stated that, on account of his own advocacy on behalf of remaining in the EU, [...] "I do not think it would be right for me <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the captain that steers our country to its next destination." ...|$|E

[...] A few months later, the island of Montserrat (one of the United Kingdom's few remaining overseas territories) was devastated by a volcanic eruption which rendered half the island uninhabitable; when the 4,500 islanders asked for more help from the DfID, Short {{was reported to have}} remarked [...] "they will be asking for golden elephants next" [...] and refused to visit the island. This remark caused great offence to the Montserratians and others; Labour MP Bernie Grant said that [...] "She sounds like a mouthpiece for an old nineteenth century colonial and Conservative government." ...|$|E

2500|$|Willy Loman {{dreams of}} being a {{successful}} salesman like Dave Singleman, somebody who has both wealth and freedom. Willy believes {{that the key to}} success is being well-liked, and his frequent flashbacks show that he measures happiness in terms of wealth and popularity. One analyst of the play writes: “Society tries to teach that, if people are rich and well-liked, they will be happy. Because of this, Willy thought that money would make him happy. He never bothered <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> happy with what he had …”. Willy also believes that to attain success, one must have a suitable personality. According to another analyst, “He believes that salesmanship is based on ‘sterling traits of character’ and ‘a pleasing personality.’ But Willy does not have the requisite sterling traits of character; people simply do not like him as much as he thinks is necessary for success.” ...|$|E
