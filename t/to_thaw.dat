5|$|While Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) is away at an {{emergency}} Federation conference, the Enterprise crew discovers an ancient space capsule from Earth. Inside they find three humans in cryonic chambers. Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) asks {{to move the}} chambers to the Enterprise and Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) agrees. Picard returns and orders the Enterprise to the Neutral Zone, as several Federation outposts near {{the edges of the}} zone have not responded to communications. He explains that the conference was about the potential threat of the Romulans, who have not been seen for the last several decades. As Data and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) work <b>to</b> <b>thaw</b> the cryonically preserved humans, Picard admonishes Data for bringing them aboard during a crucial time, and puts Riker in charge of looking after them.|$|E

5|$|The RAF {{high command}} never warmed to missiles, and always ranked them {{secondary}} to the V-bomber force. The missile bases were separate {{from the rest of}} the RAF and its personnel considered outside the mainstream. Project Emily gave the RAF considerable experience in missile operations, but the cancellation of Blue Streak on 2 February 1960 in favour of Skybolt, an air-launched ballistic missile, rendered this expertise of dubious value. Given the amount of time and money spent on Thor, consideration was given to extending the deployment. Responding to the arguments made for and against Blue Streak, there were proposals for improving Thor. If the missiles were already fuelled, then they could be launched in as little as 60 seconds, but they could only remain fuelled for two hours, after which components froze from contact with the liquid oxygen. The missiles then needed six hours <b>to</b> <b>thaw</b> out. It was impractical to base them underground, but being above ground made them very vulnerable to a nuclear attack. Yet the twenty Thor missiles squadrons were equivalent to seven and a half squadrons of V-bombers. Without them, there would be just fourteen V-bombers on quick alert.|$|E
5|$|To get to Ottawa, several {{thousand}} miles away, the club {{had to get}} to Whitehorse by overland sleigh, catch a train from there to Skagway, Alaska, then catch a steamer to Vancouver, B.C. and a train from there to Ottawa. On December 18, 1904, several players set out by dog sled and the rest left the next day by bicycle for a 330-mile trek to Whitehorse. At first the team made good progress, but the weather turned warm enough <b>to</b> <b>thaw</b> the roads, forcing the players to walk several hundred miles. The team spent the nights in police sheds along the road. At Whitehorse, the weather turned bad, causing the trains not to run for three days and the Nuggets to miss their steamer in Skagway. The next one could not dock for three days due to the ice buildup. The club found the sea journey treacherous, and it caused seasickness amongst the team. When the steamer reached Vancouver, the area was too fogged in to dock, and the steamer docked in Seattle. The team from there caught a train to Vancouver, from which it left on January 6, 1905, arriving in Ottawa on January 11.|$|E

25|$|In 1844, {{a further}} schism, this one over slavery, divided the Methodist Episcopal Church.

25|$|Researchers, {{including}} Sergei Kirpotin at Tomsk State University and Judith Marquand at Oxford University, {{warn that}} Western Siberia has begun <b>to</b> <b>thaw</b> {{as a result}} of global warming.

In 2008, a research expedition for the American Geophysical Union detected levels of methane up to 100 times above normal in the atmosphere above the Siberian Arctic, likely the result of methane clathrates being released through holes in a frozen 'lid' of seabed permafrost, around the outfall of the Lena River and the area between the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea.|$|E

25|$|Freezing: In cold {{conditions}} the cooling effect of gas expanding through a valve orifice may cool either {{first or second}} stage sufficiently to cause ice to form. External icing may lock up the spring and exposed moving parts of first or second stage, and freezing of moisture in the air may cause icing on internal surfaces. Either may cause the moving parts of the affected stage to jam open or closed. If the valve freezes closed, it will usually defrost quite rapidly and start working again, and may freeze open soon after. Freezing open {{is more of a}} problem, as the valve will then free-flow and cool further in a positive feedback loop, which can normally only be stopped by closing the cylinder valve and waiting for the ice <b>to</b> <b>thaw.</b> If not stopped, the cylinder will rapidly be emptied.|$|E
25|$|Another wrinkle in {{the issue}} is the unnatural {{geographic}} location of this Eastern-Time-Zoned region. In the western Indiana counties where Eastern time is observed (South Bend and Lafayette south to Terre Haute and Vincennes), around the summer solstice, the sun neither sets until after 9:20 pm, nor does it reach solar noon until almost 2:00 pm. During the winter months when standard time is observed, school buses in western regions lose a valuable hour of the sun's rays as they pick up children in the morning. Another notable observation is that schools in the Eastern Time Zone of Indiana tend to have far more 2-hour delays, mainly {{due to the fact that}} sunlight is required for many road de-icing components to work. With the sun rising as late as 8:20 am in some areas, available sunlight is inadequate to safely thaw the roads for school buses to pick up all their passengers on time. The argument is that if the same area were in its geographically natural Central time zone, the sun would be up an hour sooner, and it would have an additional hour <b>to</b> <b>thaw</b> the roads every morning.|$|E

This confuses Mick, and he concludes that it was Stan who tried to kill him and attacks him, prompting Shirley {{to admit that she}} had attempted to drown him. Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) finds out from Shirley that Mick is actually her son, his father is a man named Andy and her mother Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) concealed the pregnancy and brought Mick up as her and Stan's son. Shirley warns Phil not to tell Mick. Despite not being able to swim and having a phobia of water, Mick signs up to a sponsored swim in aid of his friend Billy Mitchell's (Perry Fenwick) young daughter, Janet Mitchell (Grace), who has Down's syndrome. He starts to learn at the local swimming pool, and confesses his fear to his friend, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Ian helps him overcome this fear and he makes progress. Linda tells Mick she wants another baby after she realises her children are too old to require her constant attention. Mick convinces Linda {{that this is not a}} good idea, but proposes to her, as they are not actually married, though their families think they are.

40|$|New {{research}} is finding that satellite-based radar remote sensing techniques are particularly well-suited for quantifying {{the transition of}} remote boreal regions from a frozen <b>to</b> a <b>thawed</b> condition.

Abrupt transition from frozen <b>to</b> <b>thawed</b> conditions occurs each year over roughly 50 million km 2 of the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s remote terrestrial surface at latitudes above 40 °N.

25|$|If {{the water}} {{in direct contact with}} the {{pressure}} transfer mechanism (diaphragm or piston and the spring balancing the internal pressure) of the regulator freezes, the mechanism will be locked in the position at which the freezing takes place, as the ice will prevent the movement required to close. Since the cooling takes place during flow through the regulator, it is common for the freezing to occur when the first stage valve is open, and this will freeze the valve open, allowing a continuous flow through the first stage. This will cause the inter-stage pressure to rise until the second stage opens to relieve the excess pressure, the pressure relief valve on the first stage opens, or a low pressure hose or fitting bursts. All of these effects will allow the flow through the first stage to continue, so the cooling will continue, and this will keep the ice causing the problem frozen. To break the cycle it is necessary to stop the gas flow or expose the ice to a heat source capable of melting it. While underwater, it is unlikely to find a heat source <b>to</b> <b>thaw</b> the ice and stopping the flow is only option. Clearly the flow will stop when the pressure in the cylinder drops to ambient, but this is undesirable as it means total loss of the breathing gas. The other option is to close the cylinder valve, shutting off the pressure at the source. Once this is done, the ice will normally melt as heat from the surrounding water is absorbed by the slightly colder ice, and once the ice has melted, the regulator will function again.|$|E
