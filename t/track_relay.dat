5|$|Australia won {{its first}} medal, a bronze, in 1994 in the men's 5,000metres short <b>track</b> <b>relay</b> speed skating event. Zali Steggall gained Australia's first {{individual}} medal in 1998, {{when she won}} bronze in the slalom event. In 2002, Steven Bradbury won the 1,000metres short track speed skating and Alisa Camplin won the aerials event, making Australia the only southern hemisphere country to have {{won a gold medal}} at a Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Short track {{speed skating}} has {{provided}} the country with many firsts. Australia won its first World Championships in a winter sport when their relay team won the 5,000m race in 1991, which was hosted in Sydney. However, they crashed at the 1992 Olympics when the discipline was introduced and failed to win a medal, {{and all of the}} individual competitors finished in {{the bottom half of the}} field. They recovered to post a series of strong performances in Lillehammer in 1994. The short <b>track</b> <b>relay</b> yielded Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze. The Australians also did well individually; all four representatives finished in the top 13 in at least one of their races, and in the top half in six of their eight events, including top-ten finishes for Steven Bradbury and Richard Nizielski.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France {{was viewed}} as the {{potential}} {{start of a new}} era in Australian winter sports, with hopes that a maiden medal would result. Australia's short <b>track</b> <b>relay</b> team went into the 1992 Olympics as world champions, but crashed in the semi-finals. The Australians were in third place when Richard Nizielski lost his footing and knocked over teammate John Kah during a changeover; they finished fourth and failed to reach the final. In the individual speed skating events, Australia scored only four top 20 finishes from 12 starts, with none higher than 12th, and only one placing in the top half. Kirstie Marshall {{was in the process of}} winning the 1992 World Cup series, and was one of the favourites for the women's aerial skiing, which was a demonstration event, but she crash-landed and finished seventh. Lee managed two top 20 finishes in alpine skiing events, and finished in the top half of the competitors in four events; most of the Australians remained in the bottom half in all of their events. Despite the disappointments of the near-misses, Australia increased their investment in the Winter Olympics, purchasing a training base called Sonnpark in Austria in 1993.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, {{the short}} <b>track</b> <b>relay</b> team won Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze. They {{qualified}} for the four-team final after edging out Japan and New Zealand, finishing second in their semi-final. The quartet adopted a plan of staying on their feet as the first priority, and remaining undisqualified and defeating {{at least one of}} the other three finalists. During the race, the Canadians fell and lost a significant amount of time, meaning that Australia would win a medal if they raced conservatively and avoided a crash. Late in the race, Nizielski was fighting with his American counterpart for track position to claim the silver medal, but took the safe option and yielded, mindful of the lost opportunity of the crash in Albertville. It was a successful campaign for the largest team that Australia had sent—apart from 1960. The 27 athletes recorded an unprecedented five top 10 finishes. Marshall placed first in the opening round of the aerials, but faded to sixth in the final, while Kerryn Rim placed eighth in the 15km biathlon and Steven Bradbury and Nizielski of the medal-winning relay team placed eighth and tenth in the 500m and 1,000m short track events respectively. In contrast to the previous games, the Australian short track speed skaters placed in the top half of the field in six of their eight individual starts. However, the Australians in the remaining disciplines generally finished in the bottom half of their competition.|$|E
