5|$|While George Kistiakowsky's Explosives Division (X Division) {{developed}} the explosive lenses, G Division designed {{the rest of}} the weapon. There were numerous difficulties to overcome, {{not the least of which}} was devising a means of detonating <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> with the required speed. Robert F. Christy's solid core design was chosen as the most likely design to succeed.|$|E
5|$|On 22 January 1976, {{a second}} UDR soldier, Sergeant James Roderick Shane McDowell (aged 29, an optical worker, also from Lurgan) {{was arrested and}} charged with the Miami killings. He served in C Company, 11th Battalion UDR. The RUC were led to him through his glasses which had been found at the murder scene. Tests done on the glasses, which were {{eventually}} traced back to McDowell, revealed that <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> were of a prescription worn by just 1 in 500,000 of the population.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} {{plutonium}} for the fissile {{component of the}} bomb meant that Penney's HER team at Fort Halstead had to design an implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Los Alamos Laboratory had solved the problem of doing this with explosive lenses. The involvement of several British scientists gave HER a solid base of experience to work from. The British design would hew {{to that of the}} American Fat Man as closely as possible. An important change would be the substitution of RDX, an ARD product, for Composition B as the fast explosive component of the lenses; Baratol would still provide the slow component. This was handled by the explosives experts at Woolwich, who devised the machining processes and produced prototypes of <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> and moulds. Production was then handled by two Royal Ordnance Factories. The first lenses were delivered in 1952, and there were enough for two sets for the Operation Hurricane assemblies. Woolwich provided the supercharge, the spherical shell of explosive that encases the tamper. Test firings of explosive lenses were conducted at Foulness by a team under the direction of Roy Pilgrim. To achieve near-simultaneous detonations of <b>the</b> <b>lenses,</b> the Americans had developed the exploding-bridgewire detonator; this had to be duplicated. Ernest Mott and Cecil Bean developed them, while Challens devised the firing circuits.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lens</b> {{has three}} main parts: <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> capsule, <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> epithelium, and <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> fibers. <b>The</b> <b>lens</b> capsule forms <b>the</b> {{outermost}} layer of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> and <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> fibers form <b>the</b> {{bulk of the}} interior of <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b> <b>The</b> cells of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> epithelium, located between <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> capsule and <b>the</b> outermost layer of lens fibers, are found only on the anterior side of <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lens</b> itself lacks nerves, blood vessels, or connective tissue.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lens</b> epithelium, {{located in}} the {{anterior}} portion of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> between <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> capsule and <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> fibers, is a simple cuboidal epithelium. The cells of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> epithelium regulate most of the homeostatic functions of <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b> As ions, nutrients, and liquid enter <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> from <b>the</b> aqueous humor, Na+/K+-ATPase pumps in <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> epithelial cells pump ions out of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> to maintain appropriate lens osmotic concentration and volume, with equatorially positioned lens epithelium cells contributing most to this current. The activity of the Na+/K+-ATPases keeps water and current flowing through <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> from <b>the</b> poles and exiting through the equatorial regions.|$|R
25|$|If <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> is {{biconvex}} or plano-convex, a {{collimated beam}} of light passing through <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> converges to a spot (a focus) behind <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b> In this case, <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> is called a positive or converging <b>lens.</b> <b>The</b> distance from <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> to <b>the</b> spot is the focal length of <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> which is commonly abbreviated f in diagrams and equations.|$|R
5|$|However, many {{traits that}} appear to be simple adaptations are in fact exaptations: {{structures}} originally adapted for one function, but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process. One example is the African lizard Holaspis guentheri, which developed an extremely flat head for hiding in crevices, as can be seen by looking at its near relatives. However, in this species, the head has become so flattened that it assists in gliding from tree to tree—an exaptation. Within cells, molecular machines such as the bacterial flagella and protein sorting machinery evolved by the recruitment of several pre-existing proteins that previously had different functions. Another example is the recruitment of enzymes from glycolysis and xenobiotic metabolism to serve as structural proteins called crystallins within <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> of organisms' eyes.|$|E
5|$|Photochromic lenses include silver halides, so that {{ultraviolet}} light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening <b>the</b> <b>lenses.</b> The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless silver chloride films {{are used in}} radiation detectors. Zeolite sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption. Colloidal silver is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it {{has the advantage of}} not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but {{the challenge was}} met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. In October 1944, Creutz moved to Los Alamos, where he became a group leader responsible for explosive lens design verification and preliminary testing. Difficulties encountered in testing <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> led {{to the construction of}} a special test area in Pajarito Canyon, and Creutz became responsible for testing there. As part of the preparation for the Trinity nuclear test, Creutz conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon without nuclear material. This test brought bad news; it seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Hans Bethe worked through the night to assess the results, and was able to report that the results were consistent with a perfect explosion.|$|E
5000|$|Incoming {{parallel}} {{rays are}} focused by a convex lens into an inverted real image one focal length from <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> on <b>the</b> {{far side of}} <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b> Rays from an object at finite distance are focused further from <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> than <b>the</b> focal distance; the closer {{the object is to}} <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> <b>the</b> further the image is from <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b> With concave lenses, incoming parallel rays diverge after going through <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> {{in such a way that}} they seem to have originated at an upright virtual image one focal length from <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> on <b>the</b> same side of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> that <b>the</b> parallel rays are approaching on. Rays from an object at finite distance are associated with a virtual image that is closer to <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> than <b>the</b> focal length, and on the same side of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> as <b>the</b> object. The closer the object is to <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> <b>the</b> closer the virtual image is to <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|R
25|$|Incoming {{parallel}} {{rays are}} focused by a converging lens onto a spot one focal length from <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> on <b>the</b> {{far side of}} <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b> This is called the rear focal point of <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b> Rays from an object at finite distance are focused further from <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> than <b>the</b> focal distance; the closer {{the object is to}} <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> <b>the</b> further the image is from <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Most lenses are spherical lenses: {{their two}} {{surfaces}} {{are parts of}} the surfaces of spheres. Each surface can be [...] (bulging outwards from <b>the</b> <b>lens),</b> [...] (depressed into <b>the</b> <b>lens),</b> or planar (flat). The line joining the centres of the spheres making up <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> surfaces is called the axis of <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b> Typically <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> axis passes through the physical centre of <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> because of <b>the</b> way they are manufactured. Lenses may be cut or ground after manufacturing {{to give them a}} different shape or size. <b>The</b> <b>lens</b> axis may then not pass through the physical centre of <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{principle}} transit circle was a 3-inch Combined Transit and Zenith telescope {{designed by}} Warner & Swasey especially for Illinois. The objective, by John Brashear, {{was held in}} place by a special cell that compensated for the different temperature conductivities of the brass and glass so that temperature had no effect on the location or separation of <b>the</b> <b>lenses.</b> Designated as model M-505, the transit included a handing level, micrometer and a built in reversing mechanism. This transit was located in the east-central transit room allowing direct access to the clock room through a small window. The instrument cost $1200 in 1896.|$|E
5|$|Under Kistiakowsky's leadership, X-Division {{designed}} the complex explosive lenses needed to compress the fissile plutonium pit. These employed two explosives with significantly different velocities of detonation {{in order to}} produce the required wave form. Kistiakowsky chose Baratol for the slow explosive. After experimenting with various fast explosives, X-Division settled on Composition B. Work on molding the explosives into the right shape continued into 1945. <b>The</b> <b>lenses</b> needed to be flawless, and techniques for casting Composition B and Baratol had to be developed. The ERL managed to accomplish this by devising a procedure for preparing Baratol in a form that was easy to cast. In March 1945, Kistiakowsky became part of the Cowpuncher Committee, so-called because it rode herd on the implosion effort. On July 16, 1945, Kistiakowsky watched as the first device was detonated in the Trinity test. A few weeks later a Fat Man implosion-type nuclear weapon was dropped on Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E
25|$|If <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> is biconcave or plano-concave, a {{collimated}} {{beam of light}} passing through <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> is diverged (spread); <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> is thus called a negative or diverging <b>lens.</b> <b>The</b> beam, after passing through <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> appears to emanate from a particular point on the axis in front of <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b> <b>The</b> distance from this point to <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> {{is also known as}} the focal length, though it is negative with respect to the focal length of a converging lens.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lens</b> {{is part of}} the {{anterior}} segment of the eye. In front of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> is <b>the</b> iris, which regulates the amount of light entering into <b>the</b> eye. <b>The</b> <b>lens</b> is suspended in place by the suspensory ligament of <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> a ring of fibrous tissue that attaches to <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> at its equator and connects it to the ciliary body. Posterior to <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> is <b>the</b> vitreous body, which, along with the aqueous humor on {{the anterior}} surface, bathes <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lens</b> has an ellipsoid, biconvex shape. The anterior surface is less curved than the posterior. In <b>the</b> adult, <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> is typically circa 10 mm in diameter and has an axial length of about 4 mm, though {{it is important to note}} that the size and shape can change due to accommodation and because <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> continues to grow throughout a person's lifetime.|$|R
25|$|With {{diverging}} lenses, incoming parallel rays diverge {{after going}} through <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> {{in such a way}} that they seem to have originated at a spot one focal length in front of <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b> This is <b>the</b> <b>lens's</b> front focal point. Rays from an object at finite distance are associated with a virtual image that is closer to <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> than <b>the</b> focal point, and on the same side of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> as <b>the</b> object. The closer the object is to <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> <b>the</b> closer the virtual image is to <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b> As with mirrors, upright images produced by a single lens are virtual, while inverted images are real.|$|R
25|$|PMMA {{is used in}} <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> of {{exterior}} {{lights of}} automobiles.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} by Otto Ahlström in 1950 that most have aspheric surfaces. The best of <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> have low spherical aberration, indicating that their surface profile was optimized to improve image quality. Most of <b>the</b> <b>lenses,</b> however, do not show any sign of optimization and produce worse images than a simple spherical lens.|$|E
25|$|The {{ophthalmic}} {{frame is}} the part of a pair of glasses which is designed to hold <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> in proper position.|$|E
50|$|At the {{telephoto}} end (70 mm), {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> is <b>the</b> most retracted {{providing the}} most shade protection from <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> hood.At <b>the</b> widest end (24 mm), the end of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> is <b>the</b> most protruding providing the least shade protection from <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> hood.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lens</b> {{features}} an all-plastic construction with rubber focus and zoom rings. The barrel of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> telescopes outward from <b>the</b> main <b>lens</b> body as it's zoomed in from 18mm to 200mm. To combat zoom creep, <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> features a small zoom lock switch on <b>the</b> main <b>lens</b> barrel.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>lens</b> was of 38 mm {{focal length}} {{and with a}} maximum {{aperture}} of [...] A ring around <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> optic itself was used to set the film speed (ISO 25 to 400), which was indicated on a small window {{on the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> assembly; also there, but below <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> optic itself, was the cadmium sulfide (CdS) photoresistor for the light meter. The location of this, inside the filter ring of <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> meant that <b>the</b> meter would function accurately even with filters fitted to <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>lenses</b> are bi-aspheric {{and two of}} {{them have}} very good imaging properties. Their surface appears to be an oblate ellipse, while the surface nearest the eye {{approaches}} a parabola.|$|E
25|$|The Visby lenses are a {{collection}} of lens-shaped manufactured objects made of rock crystal (quartz) found in several Viking graves {{on the island of}} Gotland, Sweden, and dating from the 11th or 12th century. Some were in silver mounts with filigree, the mounting covering the back of the lens, and were probably used as jewellery; {{it has been suggested that}} <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> themselves are much older than their mounts. Some of <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> can be seen at the Fornsal historical museum in Visby, while some are in the Swedish National Museum in Stockholm, and others have been lost.|$|E
25|$|Improved {{techniques}} and facilities allowed the plant, which operated on a 48-hour week, {{with the occasional}} 51- and 54-hour week, to triple its output in 1947. By 1949, the pilot plant employed over 700 people. <b>The</b> <b>lenses</b> were initially shipped by rail, but this was inconvenient because their high security classification required armed guards. This was therefore replaced by an air transport route, with <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> being flown in C-54 aircraft based at Fairfield-Suisun Army Air Base. On two occasions, C-54s loaded with explosives were struck by lightning, but no damage to the plane, the crew or the explosives resulted.|$|E
5000|$|Six {{electrical}} contacts {{are added to}} the bayonet ring. One is slightly recessed and allows <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> to indicate whether the aperture ring is set at 'A' or not. If it is, a pin on <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> extends slightly and makes contact, while if <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> is at any other setting the pin is retracted and does not make contact. The other five contacts are used to encode <b>the</b> <b>lens's</b> aperture range. Each contact on <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> is either conducting or non-conducting, providing a binary 1 or 0, respectively. Two contacts encode <b>the</b> <b>lens's</b> minimum aperture—, , [...] or although no Pentax K-mount lens has ever had an [...] minimum aperture, OEM <b>lenses</b> often have. <b>The</b> other three contacts encode <b>the</b> <b>lens's</b> maximum aperture; their meaning is dependent on the minimum aperture indicated by <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{development}} progresses, <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> placode {{begins to}} deepen and invaginate. As the placode continues to deepen, {{the opening to}} the surface ectoderm constricts and <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> cells forms a structure known as <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> vesicle. By <b>the</b> 10 mm stage, <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> vesicle has completely separated from the surface ectoderm.|$|R
50|$|For a thin <b>lens</b> in air, <b>the</b> {{principal}} planes both lie at {{the location}} of <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b> <b>The</b> point where they cross the optical axis is sometimes misleadingly called the optical centre of <b>the</b> <b>lens.</b> Note, however, that for a real <b>lens</b> <b>the</b> principal planes do not necessarily pass through the centre of <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> and in general may not lie inside <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> at all.|$|R
25|$|Lens {{cleaning}} systems come in {{two main}} varieties: a small motor-driven rubber wiper or brush conceptually similar to windshield wipers, or a fixed or telescopic high-pressure sprayer which cleans <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> with a spray of windshield washer fluid. Most recent lens cleaning systems are of the spray type, because UN regulations do not permit mechanical cleaning systems (wipers) {{to be used with}} plastic-lens headlamps, and most recent headlamps have plastic lenses. Some cars with retractable headlamps, such as the original Mazda MX-5, have a squeegee {{at the front of the}} lamp recess which automatically wipes <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> as they are raised or lowered, although it does not provide washer fluid.|$|E
25|$|Later {{work that}} used these ChromaGen lenses with dyslexics in a randomised, double-blind, placebo {{controlled}} trial showed highly {{significant improvements in}} reading ability over reading without <b>the</b> <b>lenses.</b> This system has been granted FDA approval {{for use in the}} United States.|$|E
25|$|Various uses {{have been}} {{proposed}} for <b>the</b> <b>lenses.</b> They {{may have been used}} by craftsmen for magnification in fine work, as reading stones, or to start fires. Olaf Schmidt has speculated that they may have been used as part of a telescope.|$|E
30|$|The {{temperature}} difference between <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> and <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> holder was verified in the heating scenario {{by using the}} proto model of LIR in an air environment in the laboratory. In order to measure <b>the</b> actual <b>lens</b> temperature, thermocouples were put directly {{on the center of}} <b>the</b> Ge <b>lens</b> and <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> holder where temperature for the telemetry is measured. A sheet heater was placed in front of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> in Fig.  8 to simulate infrared radiation from the baffle, and it was heated from 300 to 320  K. When the temperature of the heater attained a maximum of 320  K, the temperature of <b>the</b> Ge <b>lens,</b> which was initially equivalent to that of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> holder, became ~  0.6  K higher than that of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> holder. Temperature of <b>the</b> Ge <b>lens</b> on orbit also must become higher than that of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> holder monitored by the thermal sensor when the baffle is temporarily heated by solar radiation. Thus, we confirmed that the {{temperature difference}} between <b>the</b> Ge <b>lens</b> and <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> holder probably caused the background bias seen in the LIR images.|$|R

40|$|A lens {{that has}} a spherical shape will exhibit spherical aberration; the {{position}} at which parallel light rays focus is closer to <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> for rays further away from the optic axis. When a stop is placed over the outer part of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> and <b>the</b> distance between <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> and <b>the</b> image slightly adjusted, the aberration is significantly reduced, as shown in Figure 1. If a stop {{is placed on the}} center of <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> leaving <b>the</b> outer part of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> open, and <b>the</b> position of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> again adjusted, <b>the</b> image is again clearer than that with <b>the</b> entire <b>lens</b> open, as nicely shown in the video...|$|R
