He starts another tour of duty, serving with Delta Company, a U.S. Army EOD unit on its 365-day rotation.|$|E
5|$|Ferens {{remained}} a modest man; he saw giving {{as a moral}} duty and repeatedly declined offers of ennoblement. In replying to the headmaster’s speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926, the King said: The headmaster is right in assuming that I am already well acquainted with Mr Ferens’s benefactions {{in other parts of}} the country; this is not the first time I have been associated with him in this manner, and though I know the last <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would want would be a public expression of thanks on my part, I would like to be allowed to share in the debt of gratitude which the Kingswood School owes him today.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his film and television work, Roddenberry wrote the novelization of Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Although it has been incorrectly attributed to several other authors (most notably Alan Dean Foster), {{it was the first}} in a series of hundreds of Star Trek-based novels to be published by the Pocket Books imprint of Simon & Schuster, whose parent company also owned Paramount Pictures Corporation. Previously, Roddenberry worked intermittently on a novel The God <b>Thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had based upon his rejected 1975 screenplay for a proposed low-budget ($3 to $5 million) Star Trek film preceding the development of Phase II throughout 1976. Attempts to complete the project by Walter Koenig, Susan Sackett, Fred Bronson, and Michael Jan Friedman have proven to be unfeasible for a variety of legal and structural reasons.|$|E

In 1996 Roger Morgan, an amateur historian from London, uncovered evidence in the Public Record Office that the identity of the corpse was Glyndwr Michael.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)", a {{marathon}} twelve-minute opus which was edited for single release in some countries. The track {{begins with a}} guitar played {{to sound like a}} revving motorcycle, a reference to Todd Rundgren's contribution in the middle of [...] "Bat Out of Hell". Each verse comprises two things that he would do for love, followed by one <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would not do. It is that latter parts of each chorus that is the [...] "that" [...] of the title. However, some people misunderstand the lyrics, claiming that the singer never identifies what the [...] "that" [...] is that he is unwilling to do, a confusion that Steinman predicted during production. The song combines stadium rock and ballad for much of its twelve minutes. However, {{near the end of the}} song, a female vocalist is introduced. Credited in the liner notes as Mrs. Loud, this part was sung by Lorraine Crosby.|$|E
500|$|The final <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did was {{to create}} a {{breakdown}} using Auto-Tune and the Nord Lead synthesizer, applying its echo function. In total Ahmadzaï worked for 15days on the track, finally handing it to mixing engineer Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent. He explained in an interview with Keyboard magazine that the version that he created was almost same to the final track present in Music. On most of the other tracks, Stent tried to add a lot of mixing effects to Ahmadzaï's production. But for [...] "Impressive Instant", they tried to mix it first from the Sony digital tracks and failed get the original sound of the demo, since the compression present in the track was the actual sound to be produced. So Stent took the sound from Ahmadzaï's Yamaha 02R mixer, including the bass, loops, and the kick. Along with mixing the track at Olympic Studios, London, the mastering was done by Tim Young at Metropolis Studio. Other engineers working on the track included Mark Endert, Sean Spuehler, Tom Hannen and Tim Lambert.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of Todd's {{introduction}} to OLTL, he was a competitive athlete. His fraternity {{was the most important}} part of his life; Howarth stated that Todd was [...] "under intense pressure from the male figures in his life". He felt that the key to understanding Todd was his concern about his status and how others perceived him. He thought that Todd mistreated people because it made him feel better about himself and that he did not want to appear vulnerable, so his defense mechanisms [...] "spun out of control". Howarth, during an April 1994 Soap Opera Update interview, said that the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> admired about Todd was his clothing style. His interviewer called Todd's early fashion sense [...] "grunge, Salvation Army like 'rags'," [...] and Howarth described Todd's later wardrobe as [...] "all Ralph Lauren" [...] and [...] "ouble R.L. 80 dollar pants and a 400-and-something-dollar jacket". St. John, as Todd's second portrayer, described the character as [...] "kind of both good and bad. He's got his good side with his kids, and yet he is conniving and vicious and all those negative things".|$|E
500|$|Ottavio's {{marriage}} troubled Alessandro; {{he struggled}} with the burden of chastity and entertained fantasies of marrying a princess. He resented his younger brother's arrangement; during the wedding ceremony he [...] "became more deathly pale than death itself, and, so they say, is unable to bear this <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he,</b> the first-born, should see himself deprived of such splendid status and of {{the daughter of an}} Emperor." [...] In 1546 Paul gave Pier Luigi the duchies of Parma and Piacenza as papal fiefs, a highly political move by the pope: in doing so he gave titles and wealth to Pier and appointed a lord who was subservient and owed a debt of gratitude, guaranteeing that the duchies would remain under papal control. At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.|$|E
500|$|Shiamak Davar choreographed {{the dance}} {{sequence}} of [...] "Bum Bum Bole," [...] {{and was given}} free rein over its design. He had intended to use 40students from his dance school, but Khan did not want trained dancers. Davar gave the children certain cues and a general idea of what to do, but left the style and final product {{up to them to}} avoid a choreographed appearance. Time constraints meant that while Khan was busy filming [...] "Bum Bum Bole," [...] Ram Madhvani took over as director for [...] "Bheja Kum". The latter sequence, containing a [...] "fun-filled" [...] song of rhythmic dialogue, allowed the audience to perceive how Ishaan sees the world and written languages. It was intended to represent [...] "a young boy's worst nightmare, in terms of... the worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> can think of"; Madhvani based the visual concept on his son's fear of [...] "creepy-crawlies" [...] such as cockroaches, dragonflies, and lizards. Tata Elxsi's Visual Computing Labs made the creatures out of the English alphabet and numbers, although Khan insisted they include the Hindi alphabet as not all the audience would be familiar with English. The chalkboard writing's transformation into a snake was included to surprise the audience and [...] "end the song on a high note." ...|$|E

500|$|Soule rarely gets to see {{the game}} he is {{composing}} for in any sort of completed state before he begins work; as a result he bases many of his musical decisions on the company's previous games. He credits his success with this strategy {{to the fact that}} many of the games he works on come from studios that have created several successful games in the past. He finds it much easier to compose a soundtrack to a game that is very visual in nature, such as a role-playing game. He also likes {{to see the}} storyboards and concept art for the game, as he considers them a good provider of [...] "pure emotional intent" [...] for the game. When composing a soundtrack, the first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> decides is the tempo and the amount of energy the music will have; this decision is as much based on the genre of the game as it is the artistic style of the game. After that, Soule starts composing smaller tracks in the soundtrack, to make sure that they match up with the vision of the game before he starts on the major themes. Soule tries to compose all of a game's soundtrack himself rather than in a team, though he sometimes collaborates with his brother.|$|E
