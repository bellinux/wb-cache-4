50|$|Coverage {{beyond what}} the media itself is capable of is {{provided}} by the <b>automatic</b> <b>relay</b> of messages and the ability to adapt to changes automatically, without operator intervention. This removes the need for dedicated air relay platforms and relay slot planning and management. A unit will automatically retransmit a received message when necessary to ensure that the message is received by its addressees. The System Network Controller (SNC) calculates whether the relay is necessary, based on its knowledge of the connectivity among units. The ability of a unit to relay can be affected by its relay setting. This setting’s default is <b>automatic</b> <b>relay,</b> but the unit can be disabled from performing relay or designated as a preferred relayer. Relay is performed on a per message basis. Because messages are retransmitted only when necessary, this reduces the use of bandwidth.|$|R

The paper includes a theoretical part describing the components of power system protection, their function and attributes. To better {{the understanding of the}} importance of power system protection, a short study of the different types of faults that may occur in a power system and how they can be calculated has been made. One chapter covering the principles of protective relaying functions relevant for the lab, is included. It covers the theory of overcurrent (including directional), distance and differential protection, as well as challenges one may encounter when applying these protective functions. A chapter on modern relay technology, describing the possibilities and benefits of micro-processor based relays, especially with regards to communication, {{is a part of the}} report. This chapter also includes sections describing the inputs and outputs, logic and function of modern relays. The essentials of relay testing is described in the paper. The different methods available for the testing of relays; scaled physical networks, <b>relay</b> <b>testers</b> and fault simulators are mentioned. Focus has been put on use of <b>relay</b> <b>testers</b> as it is most relevant for the lab. A description of common test procedures is also included.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of the power grid depends on the successful operation of thousands of protective relays. The failure of one relay to operate as intended may lead the entire power grid to blackout. In fact, major power system failures during transient disturbances {{may be caused by}} unnecessary protective relay tripping rather than by the failure of a relay to operate. Adequate relay testing provides a first defense against false trips of the relay and hence improves power grid stability and prevents catastrophic bulk power system failures. The goal of this research project is to design and enhance the <b>relay</b> <b>tester</b> using a technology such as Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) card NI 7851. A PC based tester framework has been developed using Simulink power system model for generating signals under different conditions (faults or transient disturbances) and LabVIEW for developing the graphical user interface and configuring the FPGA. Besides, the interface system has been developed for outputting and amplifying the signals without distortion. These signals should be like the generated ones by the real power system and large enough for testing the relay’s functionality. The signals generated that have been displayed on the scope are satisfactory. Furthermore, the proposed testing system can be used for improving the performance of protective relay...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Maintaining link {{connectivity}} {{between a}} mobile robot and its control station in a non-line-of-sight environment is challenging. One {{solution is to}} use intermediate relay radios that the robot can carry and deploy when and where needed to maintain the link. However, the precise placement locations for the relays are not known ahead of time. Therefore, the deployment decision must be formulated online and the relays deployed before the link with the control station breaks. A link-quality estimator is developed based on video throughput and received signal strength indicator data. The estimator takes into account human perception of video quality that is obtained via subjective testing by an operator. The data is used to train the link-quality estimator, which issues an alert {{that can be used}} as a trigger for an <b>automatic</b> <b>relay</b> deployment mechanism or to advise the operator to manually deploy relays before the link between the robot and control station fails. ...|$|R

It {{is able to}} overcome traditional communications limitationsthrough its <b>automatic</b> <b>relaying</b> and self-healing/forming features. MANET nodes perform the routingfunctions themselves. Due to the limited wireless transmission range, the routing generally consists ofmultiple hops. Therefore, the nodes depend on one another to forward packets to the destinations. In aMobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), temporary link failures and route changes happen frequently. With theassumption that all packet losses are due to congestion, Transport Control Protocol (TCP) performs poorlyin such an environment. One problem of TCP in such environments is its inability to distinguish lossesinduced by the lossy wireless channel from the ones due to network congestion. Many TCP variants havebeen developed for the improved performance of TCP in MANET.

50|$|The {{electrical}} resistance {{of a power}} line causes it to produce more heat as the current it carries increases. If this heat is not sufficiently dissipated, the metal conductor in the line may soften such that it sags under its own weight between supporting structures.

If the other lines {{do not have enough}} spare capacity to accommodate the extra current, their overload protection will react as well, causing a cascading failure.|$|R
