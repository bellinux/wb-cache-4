5|$|Compared to the {{original}} source, Donald leans further forward towards the water, and Mickey less so. Mickey's face is more flushed, seemingly less from exertion, than embarrassment for and perhaps schadenfreude towards Donald. The composition incorporates some of the foibles of comic book printing, including misaligning the joining of <b>the</b> <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> the waves with the yellow sky to give rise to an area of white space.|$|E
5|$|Like most Southeast Asian languages, {{including}} Tai and {{the varieties}} of Chinese, E is tonal. The language is described as having seven tones, with the seventh varying allophonically with {{the length of the}} vowel it is attached to. With numbers ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest tone and 5 the highest, <b>the</b> <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> the various tones in E are as follows.|$|E

50|$|In {{a general}} axonometry of a sphere <b>the</b> image <b>contour</b> is an ellipse. <b>The</b> <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> a sphere is a circle only in an {{orthogonal}} axonometry. But, as the engineer projection {{and the standard}} isometry are scaled orthograhic projections, <b>the</b> <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> a sphere is a circle in these cases, as well. As the diagram shows, an ellipse as <b>the</b> <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> a sphere might be confusing, so, if a sphere {{is part of an}} object to be mapped, one should choose an orthogonal axonometry or an engineer projection or a standard isometry.|$|R

5|$|Glue binder {{was often}} used as an {{inexpensive}} alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived. Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine (c.1415–25) and Bouts' Entombment (c.1440–55). The paint was generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush handles. The artists often softened <b>the</b> <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> shadows with their fingers, at times to blot or reduce the glaze.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the grass}} on the putting greens was the wide-bladed Bermuda. The greens lost speed, {{especially}} during the late 1970s, after {{the introduction of a}} healthier strain of narrow-bladed Bermuda, which thrived and grew thicker. In 1978, the greens on the par 3 course were reconstructed with bentgrass, a narrow-bladed species that could be mowed shorter, eliminating grain. After this test run, the greens on the main course were replaced with bentgrass in time for the 1981 Masters. The bentgrass resulted in significantly faster putting surfaces, which has required a reduction in some of <b>the</b> <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> the greens over time.|$|E

5|$|The North Group was {{occupied}} from the Terminal Classic {{through to the}} Postclassic. This group's structures were built using a different method {{from those in the}} Central Group, and were made out of compacted clay without stone construction or facing. The group occupies Terraces7 through 9, which follow <b>the</b> <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> the natural terracing present and show no evidence of significant artificial levelling. In combination with a noted absence of sculptured monuments, the different construction methods and ceramic assemblages associated with this group imply an occupation of the North Group by a new settlement community who arrived in the Late Classic period, most probably K'iche' Maya from the highlands.|$|E

40|$|The {{shadow of}} a black hole can be one of strong {{observational}} evidences for stationary black holes. If we see shadows at the center of galaxies, we would say whether the observed compact objects are black holes. In this paper, we consider a formula for <b>the</b> <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> a shadow in an asymptotically-flat, stationary, and axisymmetric black hole spacetime. We show that the formula is useful for obtaining <b>the</b> <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadow of several black holes such as the Kerr-Newman black hole and rotating regular black holes. Using the formula, we can obtain new examples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadow of rotating black holes if assumptions are satisfied. Comment: 21 pages, no figure...|$|R

5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces of tesserae. The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, tessellated opus tessellatum using large pieces of tesserae, on average eight millimeters square, and the finer opus vermiculatum using pieces of tesserae smaller than four millimeters square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss flagstones. Pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. Thin strips of lead set into the cement are often used to distinguish <b>the</b> <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.|$|E
