5|$|Gilbert had a busy autumn. His play On Guard had an {{unsuccessful}} {{run at the}} Court Theatre, opening on 28 October 1871, while his most successful play to date, Pygmalion and Galatea, opened on 9 December, {{only a few days}} before rehearsals for Thespis were to begin. Sullivan, however, had more <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> hands after a Manchester production of The Merchant of Venice, for which he supplied incidental music, had its première on 9 September.|$|E
5|$|In {{retirement}} Denning {{moved to}} Whitchurch and continued {{the work he}} had done outside court hours, lecturing and presenting awards. He also on occasion dispensed legal advice; in February 1983 he advised Patrick Evershed on the statutory duties of water suppliers. Further hip troubles were resolved with a full replacement in March 1983, although a fall later that year forced him {{to stay at home}} for six weeks. With free <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> hands Denning spoke in the House of Lords on matters that interested him, supporting an amendment to the Abortion Act 1967 and bills designed to allow the administration of companies in financial difficulties.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Marquis was {{spending}} {{a great deal}} of <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> research into the Custer battle. He now had a dozen Cheyenne informants, including Wooden Leg. With them, from June 1928, communicating mainly with sign language or through interpreters, he consulted maps and went on field trips to the battle site. He also corresponded with George Bird Grinnell, Generals Hugh L. Scott and Edward S. Godfrey, and with Custer's widow Elizabeth Custer. He also started loaning out some of his Custer memorabilia for exhibitions. Personal contacts during this period included Laton Alton Huffman, a well-known Montana frontier photographer, W.H. Banfill of the Billings Gazette, who wrote Western history articles, artist and author Will James, and James Willard Schultz, author and explorer.|$|E
5|$|Merwin {{succeeded in}} making Startling popular and successful, and the {{bimonthly}} schedule was resumed in 1947. At the start of 1952 Startling switched to a monthly schedule; this was unusual in that Startling was notionally junior to Thrilling Wonder, its sister magazine, which remained bimonthly. Merwin left shortly before this switch, in order to spend more <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own writing. He was replaced by Samuel Mines, {{who had worked with}} Standard's Western magazines, though he was a science fiction aficionado.|$|E
5|$|When Adam Eckfeldt {{retired in}} 1839, he {{recommended}} Peale as his successor. As the Senate was not sitting, Peale {{was given a}} recess appointment as Chief Coiner of the Philadelphia Mint by President Martin Van Buren on March 27, 1839. On January 23, 1840, after the Senate reconvened, Van Buren nominated Peale; the Senate gave its approval on February 17. Despite his retirement, Eckfeldt continued {{to come to the}} mint every day until shortly before his death in February 1852, performing the function of Chief Coiner and leaving Peale with <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> hands.|$|E

5|$|After calling <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> Forest career, Mills {{was once}} again on the move, this time to Forest's {{neighbours}} Notts County on 14 August 1987. His debut came one day after joining, starting County's 4–4 home draw with Wigan Athletic on {{the opening day of}} the 1987–88 Third Division. He first scored for County with their opening goal in a 2–1 away win over Chester City on 3 October 1987. Mills played in all of County's matches in 1987–88, making 60 appearances and scoring five goals, and was named the club's Player of the Year. County reached the Southern Area final of the Associate Members' Cup, being beaten 4–1 on aggregate by Wolverhampton Wanderers. With County finishing fourth in the table they qualified for the Third Division play-offs, in which they were beaten 4–2 on aggregate by Walsall in the semi-final. He missed only three matches while a County player in 1988–89, making 36 appearances and scoring four goals.|$|E
5|$|Cagney's seventh film, The Public Enemy, {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} gangster movies of the period. Notable for a famous scene in which Cagney pushes a grapefruit against Mae Clarke's face, the film thrust him into the spotlight. He {{became one of}} Hollywood's biggest stars and one of Warner Bros.' biggest contracts. In 1938, he received his first Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, for Angels with Dirty Faces, for his subtle portrayal of the tough guy/man-child Rocky Sullivan. In 1942, Cagney won the Oscar for his energetic portrayal of George M. Cohan in Yankee Doodle Dandy. He was nominated a third time in 1955 for Love Me or Leave Me. Cagney retired from acting and dancing in 1961 to spend <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> farm with his family. He came out of retirement 20 years later for a part in the movie Ragtime (1981), mainly to aid his recovery from a stroke.|$|E
5|$|Florestan died in 1856 and his son, Charles, who {{had already}} been ruling what {{remained}} of Monaco, succeeded him as Charles III (Illustration 15). Menton and Roquebrune officially became part of France in 1861, reducing Monaco's size at a stroke by 80%. With <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> hands, Charles III now devoted his time to completing the restoration of his palace begun by his uncle Honoré V. He rebuilt St Mary's Tower (Illustration 14) and completely restored the chapel, adding a new altar, and having its vaulted ceiling painted with frescoes, while outside the façade was painted by Jacob Froëschle and Deschler with murals illustrating various heroic deeds performed by the Grimaldi. The Guard Room, the former great hall of the fortress (now known as the State Hall), was transformed by new Renaissance decorations {{and the addition of}} a monumental chimneypiece.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, {{his works}} were {{published}} in the United States for the first time, by Michigan State University Press, who later (in 1958), relinquished the rights to Viking Press. While Narayan's writings often bring out the anomalies in social structures and views, he was himself a traditionalist; in February 1956, Narayan arranged his daughter's wedding following all orthodox Hindu rituals. After the wedding, Narayan began travelling occasionally, continuing to write at least 1500 words a day even while on the road. The Guide was written while he was visiting the United States in 1956 on the Rockefeller Fellowship. While in the U.S., Narayan maintained a daily journal that was to later serve as the foundation for his book My Dateless Diary. Around this time, on a visit to England, Narayan met his friend and mentor Graham Greene for the first <b>time.</b> <b>On</b> <b>his</b> return to India, The Guide was published; the book is the most representative of Narayan's writing skills and elements, ambivalent in expression, coupled with a riddle-like conclusion. The book won him the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1958.|$|E
5|$|In late December, Bonneau {{signed for}} UMF Njarðvík of the Icelandic Úrvalsdeild. He scored a regular season-high 45 points, {{to help his}} team win Stjarnan 92–86. On 17 April 2015, he scored 52 points against KR for the fifth game of the Playoffs semi-final series. Following that performance, {{opponent}} head coach, Finnur Freyr Stefánsson, acknowledged Bonneau {{as one of the}} best players to ever play in the league. Bonneau led the Úrvalsdeild in scoring, averaging 36.9 points per game, also averaging 7.0 rebounds, 5.1 assists and 2.5 steals per game, in 11 games. On 17 June 2015, Bonneau signed a new annual contract with UMF Njarðvík; the contract would make Bonneau the highest paid player of UMF Njarðvík ever. Gunnar Örlygsson, the team's chairman, compared Bonneau with Lionel Messi in terms of impact on the club. During a pre-season training in September he suffered an achilles tendon rupture. Bonneau stayed in Iceland for rehabilitation, with an intent to join the team in the play-offs. In his first game back from the injury, Bonneau again thore his achilles tendon, this <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> right foot. In October 2016, Bonneau signed a two-month contract with Njarðvík. At the end of the contract Njarðvík decided not renew it, citing their desire to acquire a bigger player.|$|E
5|$|On July 27, 2016, Nowitzki re-signed {{with the}} Mavericks. Nowitzki {{appeared}} {{in just three}} of the Mavericks' first 13 {{games of the season}} due to illness and a strained left Achilles tendon. He returned for the 14th game of the season, but with a loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, the Mavericks fell to a 2–12 record – their worst start since going 1–23 in 1993–94. He appeared in one more before sitting out 14 straight with further Achilles tendon issues, this <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> right foot. In his return game on December 23, Nowitzki scored 17 first-half points (playing only 15 minutes before sitting out the second half) in a 90–88 win over the Clippers. On February 7, 2017 against Portland, Nowitzki moved into 10th place all-time in field goals with 10,517. Also, his two blocked shots against the Trail Blazers gave him 1,200 for this career, the 55th player in NBA history to reach that figure. On March 7, 2017, in a 122–111 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, Nowitzki became the sixth player in NBA history to score 30,000 regular-season points. He also became the first international player to reach the milestone and one of only three to score all 30,000-plus with one team—the others being Karl Malone (Utah) and Kobe Bryant (Lakers).|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of Kronan began in October 1665, and the hull was launched on 31 July 1668. The English shipwright Francis Sheldon frequently came {{in conflict with}} the admiralty over the project. The navy administrators complained that he was unduly delaying the project and was spending too much <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own private business ventures. The most aggravating contention was Sheldon's extensive and lucrative export of mast timber to England. Sheldon in turn complained about constant delays on the navy's part and lack of funds. When the ship was launched, the slipway turned out to be too small and the rear section of the keel broke off during the launching. The admiralty demanded an explanation, but Sheldon's reply was that the damage was easily mended and that the problem was that the timber had been left to dry too long. The conflict between the Admiralty and Sheldon dragged on for several years and caused constant delays. The sculptures were finished in 1669, but the rigging, tackling, and arming was drawn out a further three years, to 1672. The first occasion that the ship sailed was during the celebrations of Charles XI's accession as monarch in December 1672.|$|E
5|$|This {{narrative}} for Tommy {{is set in}} {{deep space}} in a small, self-contained biosphere bubble spaceship. Jackman's character in this plot is alone, flying in outer space toward the golden nebula of Xibalba with a large tree and a few personal effects comprising his ship. While traveling, he meditates, performs t'ai chi, grows mushrooms and cuts pieces of bark from the tree for nourishment. He also converses with apparitions of Izzi. It is implied that the tree within the biosphere also represents Izzi and that Tommy has been transporting it to Xibalba {{with the hope that}} she will be restored to him. Tommy is also shown to have applied extensive, incremental tattooed ring patterns to both of his arms similar to the tattoo of his engagement ring from Izzi in 2006; it is implied that the tattoos mark the passage of <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> journey in 2500.|$|E
