40|$|Diamond-like carbon sDLCd {{films were}} {{deposited}} on tungsten sWd tips under the KrF excimer laser in a laser {{chemical vapor deposition}} sLCVDd chamber. Raman spectroscopy showed that the deposited DLC films were phase-graded along the tips from <b>the</b> <b>apexes.</b> <b>The</b> DLC films were more diamondlike at or near <b>the</b> tip <b>apexes.</b> From numerical simulation, there is a strongly confined and enhanced optical field at <b>the</b> tip <b>apexes.</b> <b>The</b> simulation also indicates {{that there is an}} optical-field gradient from tip apexes to tip bodies. Therefore, the variations in the phases of deposited DLC films were attributed to the corresponding variations in local optical intensities along the tips. Hence, optical local near field was confirmed to be responsible to the DLC deposition...|$|R

5|$|Based on Z. tonsora, queens {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to Gerontoformica based on the mandibular structure; these mandibles have two teeth, {{one of which is}} apical (situated closer to <b>the</b> <b>apex)</b> and the other is subapical (below <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> tooth). Other similar body structures include the large ocelli, short scapes, 12 antennomeres (antenna segments), small eyes, and a clypeal margin that has a row of peg-like denticles (small bumps on a tooth). Queens can be distinguished from Gerontoformica by their flattened, broad heads. They have a broad, concave clypeal margin with a high number of denticles and two short vertical rows of denticles. They have mandibles which are half the length of Gerontoformica and have a dense brush of spicule-like setae. Furthermore, the vertex (the upper surface of the head) has a pair of oval-shaped rugose (wrinkled) patches.|$|E
5|$|Benson in 2010 {{concluded}} {{from its}} size and common distribution that Megalosaurus was <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> predator of its habitat.

30|$|During general {{pronunciation}}, articulatory organs, such as {{the tongue}} and the soft palate, change form. By observing these organs in MRI movie images during pronunciation of /asa/, we found that <b>the</b> velar <b>apex</b> was elevated with mouth opening and contacted the posterior wall of the pharynx. In some subjects, <b>the</b> velar <b>apex</b> did not contact the posterior pharyngeal wall. In contrast, <b>the</b> velar <b>apex</b> in all subjects contacted the posterior pharyngeal wall during production of /s/, and velopharyngeal closure was completed. <b>The</b> tongue <b>apex</b> also approached <b>the</b> lingual surface of the maxillary anterior teeth.|$|R

5|$|Basil II is {{considered}} among the most capable Byzantine emperors and his reign as <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> of the empire in the Middle Ages. By 1025, the date of Basil II's death, the Byzantine Empire stretched from Armenia in the east to Calabria in Southern Italy in the west. Many successes had been achieved, ranging from the conquest of Bulgaria to the annexation of parts of Georgia and Armenia, and the reconquest of Crete, Cyprus, and the important city of Antioch. These were not temporary tactical gains but long-term reconquests.|$|E
5|$|Dimetrodon was {{probably}} one of <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> predators of the Cisuralian ecosystems, feeding on fish and tetrapods, including reptiles and amphibians. Smaller Dimetrodon species may have had different ecological roles. The sail of Dimetrodon may have been used to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies argue that the sail would have been ineffective at removing heat from the body, and was most likely used in courtship display.|$|E
50|$|For the {{trigonal}} bipyramid, {{the tripod}} shaped ligand has its most symmetrical {{position with the}} bridging donor at one of <b>the</b> <b>apexes,</b> and <b>the</b> feet of the tripod are arranged around the base, leaving a vacant position at <b>the</b> opposite <b>apex.</b> This has C3v symmetry. Trigonal bipyramidal coordination tends to occur where five member rings are formed with the bridgehead, bridge, feet donor atoms and central atom.|$|R

5|$|Diplodocines have {{highly unusual}} teeth {{compared}} to other sauropods. The crowns are long and slender, and elliptical in cross-section, while <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> forms a blunt, triangular point. The most prominent wear facet is on <b>the</b> <b>apex,</b> though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods, diplodocine wear patterns are on the labial (cheek) side of both {{the upper and lower}} teeth. What this means is that Diplodocus and other diplodocids had a radically different feeding mechanism than other sauropods. Unilateral branch stripping is the most likely feeding behavior of Diplodocus, as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth (coming from tooth–food contact). In unilateral branch stripping, one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, while the other would act as a guide and stabilizer. With the elongated preorbital (in front of the eyes) region of the skull, longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action. Also, the palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behaviour: 1) an increased gape, and 2) allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows, creating a smooth stripping action.|$|E
5|$|Giganotosaurus was {{probably}} <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> predator in its ecosystem. It shared its environment with herbivorous dinosaurs {{such as the}} titanosaurian sauropod Andesaurus, and the rebbachisaurid sauropods Limaysaurus and Nopcsaspondylus. Other theropods include the abelisaurid Ekrixinatosaurus, the dromaeosaurid Buitreraptor, and the alvarezsaurid Alnashetri. Other reptiles include the crocodyliform Araripesuchus, sphenodontians, snakes, and the turtle Prochelidella. Other vertebrates include cladotherian mammals, a pipoid frog, and ceratodontiform fishes. Footprints indicate the presence of large ornithopods and pterosaurs as well.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been given}} top {{priority}} by the Air Force, {{the first flight}} test of the Bold Orion missile was conducted on May 26, 1958, from a Boeing B-47 Stratojet carrier aircraft, which launched the Bold Orion vehicle at <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> of a high-speed, high-angle climb. The zoom climb tactic, combined with the thrust from the rocket motor of the missile itself, allowed the missile to achieve its maximum range, or, alternatively, to reach space.|$|E
40|$|Phloem-mobile {{endogenous}} RNA is trafficked selectively into <b>the</b> shoot <b>apex.</b> In contrast, most {{viruses and}} long-distance {{post-transcriptional gene silencing}} (PTGS) signals are excluded from <b>the</b> shoot <b>apex.</b> These observations suggest the operation of an underlying regulatory mechanism. To examine this possibility, a potexvirus movement protein, known to modify cell-to-cell trafficking and PTGS, was expressed ectopically in transgenic plants. These plants {{were found to be}} compromised in their capacity to exclude both viral RNA and silencing signals from <b>the</b> shoot <b>apex.</b> <b>The</b> transgenic plants also displayed various degrees of abnormal leaf polarity depending on transgene expression level. Normal patterns of organ development were restored by either virus- or Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated induction of PTGS. This revealed the presence of an RNA signal surveillance system that acts to allow the selective entry of RNA into <b>the</b> shoot <b>apex.</b> We propose that this surveillance system regulates signaling and protects <b>the</b> shoot <b>apex,</b> in particular <b>the</b> cells that give rise to reproductive structures, from viral invasion...|$|R
