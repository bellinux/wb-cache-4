5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{people of}} the earlier Roman period lived in small, {{unprotected}} villages, populated each by a few dozen residents at most, made up of several houses, usually set partially below the ground level (semi-sunken), each covering an area of 8–22 square meters. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to dig and build wells, so the settlements didn't have to be located near bodies of water. Thirteen 2nd century wells with variously constructed timber lined walls were found at a settlement in Stanisławice, Bochnia County. Fields were being used for crop cultivation {{for a while and}} then as pastures, when animal excrement helped the soil regain fertility. Once iron share plows were introduced the fields were alternated between tillage and grazing.|$|E
5|$|The Tunisia battle {{sequence}} {{that opened the}} film was the last major sequence filmed. The filmmakers wanted to avoid the appearance that von Stauffenberg wanted to kill Hitler because of the injuries he suffered in the battle. They began a rough cut in October 2007, and between then and June 2008, there were several test screenings without the battle sequence. By June 2008, the filmmakers felt that <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to adequately frame the characters when filming the battle sequence. Singer scouted Jordan and Spain for locations, but the candidates {{did not meet the}} aesthetic and economic criteria. The Cougar Buttes desert in California was ultimately chosen to represent Tunisia. Since the production budget was adjusted to provide visual effects to make von Stauffenberg's injuries realistic, not enough was left for solely computer-generated fighter planes. Singer instead used two P-40 Warhawks in the battle sequence. The budget increased in the course of production due to the filming in Germany, the rebuilding of sets, and lost shooting days, but German tax rebates tempered the growth. The studio reported its final production budget to be $75 million, but competing studios believed it to be closer to $90 million.|$|E

25|$|In 1835, the U.S. Army {{arrived to}} enforce the treaty. The Seminole leader Osceola led the vastly outnumbered {{resistance}} during the Second Seminole War. Drawing on {{a population of about}} 4,000 Seminole and 800 allied Black Seminoles, he mustered at most 1,400 warriors (Andrew Jackson estimated they had only 900). They countered combined U.S. Army and militia forces that ranged from 6,000 troops at the outset to 9,000 at the peak of deployment in 1837. To survive, the Seminole allies employed guerrilla tactics with devastating effect against U.S. forces, as <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to move within the Everglades and use this area for their protection. Osceola was arrested (in a breach of honor) when he came under a flag of truce to negotiations with the US in 1837. He died in jail less than a year later. He was decapitated, his body buried without his head.|$|E
25|$|The steel barque Anjou ran ashore on Auckland Island on 5 February 1905. The 22 {{crew members}} made it ashore in Carnley Harbour on {{three of the}} ship's boats after rowing against strong currents. Ten days later they reached the depot at Camp Cove, which {{provided}} them with ample supplies {{as well as the}} shipping schedule of the Hinemoa so <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> long they would have to wait for rescue. Captain Le Tellac commended the provisions that the government had left for the castaways, without which they would not have survived. (It was noted, however, that some of the supplies that should have been there were missing; these were later recovered from the house of a Mr Glenning, a lessee of the island.) Reaching Norman Inlet on 7 May, Captain Bollons of the Hinemoa noticed signs that there were castaways, located them, and was able to pick them up from the island and carry them to Dunedin. Sailors from the Compadre and the Anjou engraved their names {{on the walls of the}} Camp Cove depot.|$|E
25|$|Colonialism was a {{capitalist}} venture moved by appropriation and plundering of foreign lands. It {{was supported by}} military force and a discourse that legitimized its violence {{in the name of}} progress and a universal civilizing mission. This discourse is complex and multi-faceted. It was elaborated in the 19th century by colonial ideologues such as Joseph-Ernest Renan and Arthur de Gobineau, but its roots reach far back in history. In Rethinking Postcolonialism: Colonialist Discourse in Modern Literature and the Legacy of Classical Writers, Amar Acheraiou discusses the history of colonialist discourse and traces its spirit to ancient Greece, including Europe’s claim to racial supremacy and right to rule over non-Europeans harboured by Renan and other 19th century colonial ideologues. He argues that modern colonial representations of the colonized as “inferior”, “stagnant” and “degenerate” were borrowed from Greek and Latin authors like Lysias (440-380 BC), Isocrates (436-338 BC), Plato (427-327 BC), Aristotle (384—322 BC), Cicero (106-43 BC), and Sallust (86-34 BC), who all considered their racial others – the Persians, Scythians, Egyptians as “backward”, “inferior”, and “effeminate”. Among these ancient writers Aristotle is the one who articulated more thoroughly these ancient racial assumptions, which served as a source of inspiration for modern colonists. In The Politics, he established a racial classification and ranked the Greeks superior to the rest. He considered them as an ideal race to rule over Asian and other ‘barbarian’ peoples, for <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to blend the spirit of the European “war-like races” with Asiatic “intelligence” and “competence”.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} inhabitants on the Kurnell Peninsula {{were the}} Gweagal people, a clan of the Tharawal (or Dharawal) tribe who occupied {{the region for}} thousands of years. Their tribe spanned the areas between the Cooks and Georges Rivers from the shores of Botany Bay and westwards towards Liverpool. According to a Gweagal elder, Dharawal {{is similar to a}} state and Gweagal is similar to a shire within the state, Cunnel (Kurnell) is a family village within the shire. A clan consisted of approximately 20 to 50 people who lived in their own territory. They had no written language and each tribe had its own dialect. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to light fires long before the arrival of white man. Their clothing consisted of a woven hair sash in which they used to carry tools and weapons and sometimes the optional possum-skin coat for the winter season. The Gweagal Aborigines were the northernmost tribe of the Dharawal nation. They fished from canoes or from the shore using barbed spears and fishing lines with hooks in and around Botany Bay and the Georges River. Waterfowl could be caught in the swamplands (Towra Point), and the variety of soils would have supported a variety of edible and medicinal plants. Birds and their eggs, possums, wallabies and goannas were also a part of their staple diet, in which they made fur coats and ceremonial attire. The abundance of fish and other foodstuffs in these heavily timbered waterways meant that these natives were less nomadic than those of Outback Australia. The various middens, rock carvings and paintings in the area confirm this.|$|E

500|$|Antemoro kings (andrianony) were {{selected}} by popular decision {{from among the}} Anakara clan, originally clustered around {{the mouth of the}} Matitanana river near the town of Manakara that shares their name. Once selected, these rulers were accorded a near-sacred status. The fady they established were scrupulously observed for centuries after the ruler's death. The Anakara were responsible for safeguarding the sacred Antemoro idols and texts, spoke a secret language for communicating arcane knowledge amongst themselves, and rarely intermarried with other Antemoro clans. [...] This clan was believed to be in communication with powerful genies (ziny) and other spirits and was reputed to produce the most powerful sorcerers and astrologers on the island. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to manufacture charms, cast spells, and practice geomancy using local gemstones. To maintain their distinction from other members of Antemoro society, the Anakara lived in villages sealed off by spiked wooden palisades where none could enter without permission. Rulers were further distinguished by fady forbidding them to wear shirts or hats.|$|E
500|$|Rilke {{uses the}} images of love and of lovers {{as a way of}} showing mankind's {{potential}} and humanity's failures in achieving the transcendent understanding embodied by the angels.

[...] (Liebende könnten, verstünden sie's, in der Nachtluft / wunderlich reden.) He depicts [...] "the inadequacy of ordinary lovers" [...] and contrasts a feminine form of [...] "sublime love" [...] and a masculine [...] "blind animal passion."

[...] He notices a [...] "decline in the lives of lovers... when they began to receive, they also began to lose the power of giving." [...] Later, during World War I, he would lament that [...] "the world has fallen into the hands of men." [...] In the face of death, life and love is not cheap and meaningless and Rilke asserted that great lovers are able to recognize all three (life, love, and death) as part of a unity. Rilke asserted that the true meaning of love could be understood through death providing love a meaning in this unity—that [...] "the nature of every ultimate love... is only able to reach the loved one in the infinite." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{generation}} {{younger than}} Ibrăileanu, George Călinescu also noted {{the contrast between}} Mihail Kogălniceanu and his predecessors, as two sets of [...] "Messianist" [...] intellectuals—in this contrast, Heliade Rădulescu was [...] "hazy and egotistic", whereas Kogălniceanu and others had [...] "a mission which <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to translate into positive terms". As a historian, Kogălniceanu notably introduced several more or less influential Romantic nationalist theses: after 1840, he was noted for stressing {{the image of the}} 17th-century Wallachian Prince Michael the Brave as a unifier of Romania, although this view had not been at all present in his earlier essays; he proposed that the Romanian folk was among the first European peoples to record history in their national language, although the earliest Romanian-language chronicles date back to the 17th century; additionally, he argued that the Second Bulgarian Empire was a Romanian state. In some of his works, he claimed that Romanians traditionally practiced endogamy to preserve their purity. His 1837 study of the Romani people (Esquisse sur l'histoire, les moeurs et la langue des Cigains, or [...] "Sketch of the History, Mores and Language of the Cigains") is however still seen as a groundbreaking work in its field. According to historian Viorel Achim, while it [...] "does not reach the standards of scientific research", the book is still [...] "a genuine contribution" [...] to [...] "Romology", and [...] "a work of reference".|$|E
