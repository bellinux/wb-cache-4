5|$|Evidence {{submitted}} to the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London included a recommendation to divide Middlesex into two counties of North Middlesex and West Middlesex.

5|$|Following the Local Government Act 1888, the {{remaining}} county {{came under the}} control of Middlesex County Council except for the parish of Monken Hadley, which became part of Hertfordshire.

5|$|Harrison Scott, {{a retired}} engineer, was {{traveling}} north on I-5 {{with his son}} in 1991, when his son speculated about the difficulty of driving over the first road through the rugged terrain. Having some extra time, and recalling a drive on the old road in 1955, they left the freeway and traveled along most of the abandoned section. Near SR138, Scott asked a county road crew which was resurfacing the road if it was still maintained by <b>the</b> <b>county,</b> <b>and</b> the crew replied that they didn't know who maintained it through the desert. It {{turned out that the}} county officially owned it but did not maintain it; Scott has since convinced <b>the</b> <b>county</b> <b>and</b> forest to exchange ownership with the Santa Anita Canyon Road, then a county road.|$|E

A wealthier prisoner could pay his roommate to go away—"buy out the chum"—for half-a-crown a week in 1818, while the outcast chum would sleep in the tap room or find another room to rent in the prison. The only prisoners not expected to pay chummage were debtors who had declared themselves insolvent by swearing an oath that they had assets worth less than 40 shillings. If their creditors agreed, they could be released after 14days, but if anyone objected, they remained confined to the poor side of the building, near the women's side, receiving a small weekly allowance from <b>the</b> <b>county</b> <b>and</b> money from charity.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the county}} line, NY18 becomes the Roosevelt Highway.

While NY63 ends here, Lyndonville Road continues north to the lake as County Route63-1 (CR63-1). This portion of Lyndonville Road was once part of NY63. In Carlton, NY18 intersects the northern terminus of NY279, the last in a series of northsouth routes that terminate at NY18. Not far to the east, the route serves Lakeside Beach State Park and indirectly connects to the western terminus of the Lake Ontario State Parkway. At this point, the Seaway Trail leaves NY18 to follow the parkway along the lakeshore.|$|E
