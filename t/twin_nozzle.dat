40|$|Fuel {{injectors}} {{for marine}} applications have traditionally utilized nozzles with symmetric equispaced orifice configuration. But {{in light of}} the new marine emission legislations the <b>twin</b> <b>nozzle</b> concept has arisen. The <b>twin</b> <b>nozzle</b> differs from the conventional configuration by utilizing two closely spaced orifices to substitute each orifice in the conventional nozzle. Injector manufacturers regard <b>twin</b> <b>nozzle</b> injectors as a promising approach to facilitate stable spray patterns independent of the fuel quantity delivered through the nozzle. If true, injector systems in dual fuel engines can be simplified by reducing the amount of nozzles needed. It is also believed that twin nozzles can improve mixture formation for the combustion process for all diesel applications. This thesis explores the possibility of using the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software AVL FIRE to predict the behaviour of L'Orange's <b>twin</b> <b>nozzle</b> during fuel injection. The thesis does not seek to verify and validate the proposed numerical model, but rather perceive an understanding of the overall flow trend in a <b>twin</b> <b>nozzle</b> and how it may outperform a conventional nozzle. The nozzle is represented by a moving grid where the moving part replicates the needle movement. The needle profile is a ramp function. To take cavitation in account the numerical model is a multiphase model, containing three phases (diesel, vapour and air). The <b>twin</b> <b>nozzle</b> injects the fuel into a constant volume filled with air. The chosen turbulence model is the high Reynolds number k-ϵ model. The mass flow and the velocity is found to be greater for the upper injector hole. A vortex in the SAC volume i. e. {{the lower part of the}} nozzle seems to be the reason for this. Cavitation is found to have major effect on internal nozzle flow, especially during opening and closing of the needle. Vapour is formed at sharp injector hole inlets and it travels all the way to the outlets, reducing the effective cross sectional area which the fuel can flow through. In-cylinder pressure and rail pressure is found to have an effect on the nozzle behaviour. It is noted that the numerical model has a discrepancy causing too high air density. This only affects the results obtained downstream of the outlet and not the internal nozzle flow. The <b>twin</b> <b>nozzle</b> is compared to a conventional single orifice nozzle. The proposed numerical model lack certain features making it difficult to explicitly state if the <b>twin</b> <b>nozzle</b> outperforms the conventional nozzle. However, the outlets in the <b>twin</b> <b>nozzle</b> have a smaller vapour fraction than the outlet in the single orifice nozzle. This enhances the effective cross sectional area and might render twin nozzles more effective for injecting larger quantities even if its injector hole dimensions favour pilot injections...|$|E

Effect of charging on droplet density, area covered by droplets, volume of spray deposition, uniformity coefficient and droplet size were observed during {{the evaluation of the}} electrostatic sprayer and comparison was made between two different types of nozzle i. e. twin and single nozzle.

Little information on the co-flowing situation exists other than a previous study at Oxford. This thesis thus represents a significant database for co-flowing rocket plumes of this form. The work presented deals with two new aspects of co- flowing rocket plumes in that detailed flowfield measurements have been made and plumes from <b>twin</b> <b>nozzle</b> have been investigated {{for the first time in}} this thesis. This study on twinjet rocket plumes was carried out using the University of Oxford Gun Tunnel. Twinjet rockets with nozzle exit Mach numbers of 3 and 5 were tested in quiescent and in co-flow at Mach 7 using nitrogen and hydrogen injections. A major feature of the twinjet case was the so-called impingement shock between the flows from the two nozzles. It was discovered that this shock was insensitive to the freestream and scaling parameters are suggested for its geometry. Comparisons with single equivalent thrust nozzles are made at downstream locations and similar Pitot pressure profiles were observed for nitrogen injection in a nitrogen freestream after approximately 3 nozzle diameters downstream. Shear layers were studied and fluctuations in this region were measured by fast-response Pitot pressure and heat transfer probes sampled at 1. 1 MHz. The extent of the shear layer was deduced using a new Oxford Total Temperature Probe. With the freestream stagnation temperature at approximately 650 K and injected gas at 350 K, a linear variation for the deduced total temperature across the shear layer was obtained. This was consistent with the Pitot pressure variations across this region. Convective heat transfer coefficient fluctuations and flow total temperature fluctuations across rocket flowiields were obtained using three thin-film heat transfer probes and found to be closely correlated. Experimental results for the twinjet and the single jet were compared with CFD simulations and good overall agreements were achieved.

A short boom of 4 nozzles (50 cm spacing, 60 cm height) was oriented in either lateral or frontal position. The effect of wind speed (2, 4 and 7. 5 m. s- 1), nozzle type (including mix types) were studied. Nozzle types were FF 110 02 (Albuz AXI), air injection FF (Albuz CVI) 110 02, and air injection twin jets (Albuz CVI Twin) 110 02 and were used at 2. 5 bar. Differ-ent nozzle arrangements represented 18 tests in lateral position and 21 in frontal position. Deposition values every 5 cm are processed with an inverse cumulative calculation. Results are expressed in terms of (i) the cumulated amount of drift (ii) drift values at 5 m (minimum buffer zone width in France). Results logically showed that an increase of wind speed leads to an increase in lateral spray drift values for all modalities. Results confirmed that drift reduction classification of nozzles based on lateral or frontal measurements are not comparable (Douzals, 2012). In frontal position, the number of nozzles induced a cumulative effect on spray deposition without protective effect between collateral sprays.

The baseline supersonic nozzle under investigation {{is one that}} is designed with a sharp throat radius of curvature and conical convergent and divergent sections with flat seals. Relevant baseline geometries are defined by the supersonic nozzle exhaust ducts on the F 101, F 110, F 414, and F 119 engines. Acoustic suppression technology being investigated utilizes corrugated surface topology for the divergent section of a supersonic nozzle, divergent sections with bevelled exhaust, and high pressure water drop injection from the nozzle nacelle trailing edge.

40|$|Medicinal {{particles}} or aerosols of {{the size}} range from 1 to 5 µm at high output rates are required for efficient and effective inhaled drug delivery to rapidly administer a large dose of medicine to the lung. Current commercial devices all suffer from broad aerosol size distributions, with a geometrical standard deviation (GSD) range of 1. 5 to > 4. 0, {{making it difficult to}} deliver sufficient drug to targeted sites precisely and rapidly. The silicon-based megahertz multiple-Fourier horn ultrasonic nozzles (MFHUNs) presented in this dissertation have been shown capable of producing such micrometer-sized particles (aerosols) at high output rate and low electrical drive power. The precise control of aerosol size and much narrower size distribution achieved by the new device will greatly improve targeting of treatment within the respiratory tract and improve delivery efficiency, resulting in better efficacy, fewer side effects, shorter treatment times, and lower medication costs compared with the existing nebulizers. The basic ultrasonic nozzle consists of a drive section and a resonator section with a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducer bonded on the drive section to excite large mechanical vibrations on the end face of the distal horn to initiate instability of megahertz (MHz) Faraday waves on the free liquid surface. In operation, a medicinal liquid layer with a certain thickness is formed on the end face of the nozzle tip via a silica tube. The dramatic resonance effect among the multiple Fourier horns and high growth rate of the MHz Faraday waves excited on the medicinal liquid layer together facilitate ejection of monodisperse aerosols of desirable size range (2 - 5 µm) at low electrical power(< 1. 0 W). The interaction between the medicinal liquid layer and the MFHUN was studied for optimization of nozzle designs. The effect of variations of the medicinal liquid layer on the performance of MFHUN was minimized by increasing the half-power bandwidth of the MFHUN. The temporal instability of Faraday waves has been observed and studied on both a planar liquid layer and a spherical water drop. The critical excitation displacement of the nozzle end face for temporal instability of MHz Faraday waves on the liquid layer was verified via measuring the threshold drive voltage. The theoretical prediction of the aerosol diameter was verified by the size analyses of aerosols produced at the drive frequencies of 1. 0, 1. 5 2. 0 and 2. 5 MHz. A number of common pulmonary drugs have been nebulized with desirable aerosol sizes and output rates using the pocket-size units consisting of a single <b>nozzle</b> or <b>twin</b> <b>nozzles.</b> A versatile ultrasonic nebulizer that utilizes a twin-nozzle of multiple Fourier horns at 1 - 2 MHz drive frequencies has also been realized to demonstrate the capability of doubling the aerosol output rate of the same drug solution as well as simultaneous aerosolization of two different drug solutions...|$|R
40|$|ReportThe {{goals of}} this project were to {{identify}} equipment that maximizes spray coverage {{on the underside of}} leaves of cucurbits and to determine if powdery mildew can be controlled effectively with nonsystemic fungicides when coverage is maximized. Conventional nozzles and sprayers deliver little spray material to the underside of leaves. Therefore, growers presently rely on systemic fungicides to control powdery mildew in cucurbits. Fungicide resistance is a major concern because systemic fungicides are at risk for resistance development due to their single-site mode of action and because the powdery mildew fungus has demonstrated high potential for developing resistance. For this project, unfortunately, it was only possible to examine spray coverage because of technical problems with the sprayer. Greater coverage on both leaf surfaces was achieved with the air induction and <b>twin</b> jet <b>nozzles,</b> two novel types for a conventional hydraulic spray boom, than with the traditional flat fan, hollow cone, and cone jet nozzles. Better coverage was obtained on upper leaf surfaces with these novel nozzles than with the air assist boom; similar coverage was obtained on the underside of leaves. The differences between the novel and traditional nozzle types were not great, however, this was a limited study because it could not be started until late in the growing season. Additional research is needed to further these preliminary results and to obtain a true measure of spray coverage by examining disease control...|$|R
40|$|A {{small scale}} ground effect test rig {{was used to}} study the ground plane flow field {{generated}} by a STOVL aircraft in hover. The objective of the research was to support NASA-Ames Research Center planning for the Large Scale Powered Model (LSPM) test for the ARPA-sponsored ASTOVL program. Specifically, small scale oil flow visualization studies were conducted to make a relative assessment of the aerodynamic interference of a proposed strut configuration and a wall configuration on the ground plane stagnation line. A simplified flat plate model representative of a generic jet-powered STOVL aircraft was used to simulate the LSPM. Cold air jets were used to simulate both the lift fan and the <b>twin</b> rear engines. <b>Nozzle</b> Pressure Ratios were used that closely represented those used on the LSPM tests. The flow visualization data clearly identified {{a shift in the}} stagnation line location for both the strut and the wall configuration. Considering the experimental uncertainty, it was concluded that either the strut configuration o r the wall configuration caused only a minor aerodynamic interference...|$|R
40|$|ReportThe {{goals of}} this project were to {{identify}} equipment that maximizes spray coverage {{on the underside of}} leaves of cucurbits and to determine if powdery mildew can be controlled effectively with nonsystemic fungicides when coverage is maximized. Conventional nozzles and sprayers deliver little spray material to the underside of leaves. Thus systemic fungicides are currently essential for controlling powdery mildew in cucurbits. Fungicide resistance is a major concern because systemic fungicides are at-risk for resistance development due to their single-site mode of action and because the powdery mildew fungus has demonstrated high potential for developing resistance. Organic growers would also benefit from identification of a means to improve spray deposition as there are no systemic fungicides approved for organic production. The contact fungicide Bravo was applied using an air assist sprayer and using two novel <b>nozzles</b> (<b>twin</b> jet and air induction) and three traditional nozzles (flat fan, hollow cone, and cone jet) on a conventional boom. Parallel experiments were conducted on muskmelon and on pumpkin because these cucurbit crops have different canopies...|$|R
40|$|The Langley 16 foot {{transonic}} tunnel {{was used to}} determine the aeropropulsive characteristics of <b>twin</b> single-expansion-ramp vectoring <b>nozzles</b> installed in a wing-body configuration with forward-swept wings. The configuration was tested with and without fixed canards. The test conditions included free-stream Mach numbers of 0. 60, 0. 90, and 1. 20. The model angle of attack ranged from - 2 deg to 14 deg; the nozzle pressure ratio ranged from 1. 0 (jet off) to 9. 0. The Reynolds number based on the wing mean aerodynamic chord varied from 3. 0 x 10 to the 6 th power to 4. 8 x 10 to the 6 th power, depending on Mach number. Aerodynamic characteristics were analyzed {{to determine the effects of}} thrust vectoring and the canard effects on the wing-afterbody-nozzle and the wing-afterbody portions of the model. Thrust vectoring had no effect on the angle of attack for the onset of flow separation on the wing but resulted in reduced drag at angle-of-attack values above that required for wing flow separation. The canard was found to have little effect on the thrust-induced lift resulting from vectoring, since canard effects occurred primarily on the wing...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate two tips of spraying nozzles (hollow cone nozzle and two flat fan nozzle annexed to a nozzle body DUO) and three spray volumes (100, 150 and 200 dm 3 ha- 1), whose application was for the control of the Asian soybean rust. An area of 288 m 2 was used, with a randomized blocks design in a factorial 2 × 3 with 4 repetitions, total of 24 experimental parcels of 12 m 2. For the spraying with hydraulical nozzles a costal spray of constant pressure kept by C 02 compressed with bar of 2 m was used. The analysis of the covering percentage was carried through by means of the use of hidro-sensible paper, that was placed in three position of the plant what it represents, in height, the third superior, average and inferior of the canopy. For both the third no interaction between the evaluated factors, was found and meither difference statistics between the spraying tips and the volumes. In absolute values the <b>twin</b> flat fan <b>nozzle</b> DUO presented minimum difference of covering in relation to the hollow cone nozzle, and for the spray volume of 200 dm 3 ha - 1 presented greater covering percentage...|$|R
40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part I: Journal of Systems and Control Engineering [© IMechE]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] control techniques for increasing the rate of jet mixing in axisymmetric nozzle flows have been investigated. A combination of water tunnel and high-speed airflow facilities is {{used to assess the}} near-field jet behaviour. Solid tabs, steady fluid tabs (i. e. discrete radially discharged control jets located close to the core jet exit), and pulsed fluid tabs are compared. The effect of fluid tab velocity amplitude, pulse rate, and pulse phase are studied using open-loop control. The measurements indicate that fluid tabs generate a similar streamwise vortex formation process (and hence display increased mixing) as previously observed in solid-tabbed nozzle flows. In incompressible testing the mixing effectiveness with a pair of pulsed fluid tabs 180 ° out-of-phase was as good as a <b>twin</b> solid tab <b>nozzle</b> for a control jet flowrate of only 0. 5 per cent of the primary (core) jet flow. In preliminary high-speed testing similar benefits of fluid tabs over solid tabs were observed. Further study of pulsed fluid tabs is recommended; they have the attractive performance benefit that they can be easily switched off when not needed and offer increased flexibility as the basis of an optimized active control jet mixing device...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{application}} with different nozzle types and volume rates on spray deposition in the V 3 stage of two soybean cultivars was evaluated. The experiments {{were conducted in}} the Facultad de Ciencias Agronomicas of the UNESP-Botucatu/SP. The nozzles evaluated were an air induced flat fan nozzle (Al 11015 at 150 L ha(- 1), Al 11002 at 200 and 250 L ha(- 1)), a <b>twin</b> flat fan <b>nozzle</b> (TJ 60 11002 at 150, 200 and 250 L ha(- 1)), and a cone nozzle (TX 6 at 150 L ha(- 1), TX 8 at 150 L ha(- 1) and TX 10 at 250 L ha(- 1)). To evaluate spray deposition on the plants, a tracer (Brilliant Blue FD&C- 1) was added. The experimental design was random blocks with four replications. Deposition on plants was determined by absorbancy reading in 630 nm wavelength. The data were adjusted to a calibration curve and transformed into deposited spray volume in mL. The relationship deposition per unit of dry matter was adjusted to a regression curve (Gompertz model). In cultivar CD 208, the highest deposit was for the larger volumes and for the treatment TX 8 200 L ha(- 1). The most uniform treatments were all the nozzles with the volume 150 L ha(- 1) and the TJ 60 nozzle for 200 1, ha(- 1). In cultivar CD 216, the greatest spray depositions were achieved with the treatments Al at 200 and 250 L ha(- 1) and TJ 60 at 250 L ha(- 1), and the most uniform treatments were the TX 6 and TJ 60 nozzles for the volume 150 L ha(- 1) ...|$|R
