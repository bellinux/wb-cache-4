5000|$|The {{thinking}} behind smart economics dates back, at least, to {{the lost}} {{decade of the}} Structural Adjustment Policies (SAPs) in the 1980s. In 1995, World Bank issued its flagship publication on gender matters of the year Enhancing Women’s Participation in Economic Development (World Bank 1995). This report marked a critical foundation to the naissance of Smart Economics; in a chapter entitled ‘The Pay-offs to Investing in Women,’ the Bank proclaimed that investing in women “speeds economic development by raising productivity and promoting the more efficient use of resources; it produces significant social returns, improving child survival and reducing fertility, and it has considerable intergenerational pay-offs.” [...] The Bank also emphasized its associated social benefits generated by investing in women. For example, the Bank turned to researches of Whitehead that evidenced a greater female-control of household income is associated with better outcomes for children’s welfare [...] and Jeffery and Jeffery who analyzed the positive correlation between female education and lower fertility rates. [...] In the 2000s, the approach of smart economics came to be further crystallized through various frameworks and initiatives. A first step was World Bank’s Gender Action Plan (GAP) 2007-/2010, followed by the “Three Year Road Map for Gender Mainstreaming 2010-13.” The 2010-13 framework responded to criticisms for its precursor and incorporated some shifts in <b>thematic</b> <b>priorities.</b> [...] Lastly but not least, the decisive turning point was 2012 marked by its publication of “World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development.” [...] This Bank’s first comprehensive focus on the gender issues was welcomed by various scholars and practitioners, {{as an indicator of}} its seriousness. For example, Shahra Razavi appraised the report as ‘a welcome opportunity for widening the intellectual space’.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{examines}} {{the issues that}} the ongoing revolution in biosciences and biotechnology pose to social science. A convenient frame for examining these issues is the framework of ?<b>thematic</b> <b>priorities?</b> established by the British funding agency for social science, the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). These ?<b>thematic</b> <b>priorities?</b> are used to identify major challenges and opportunities that currently confront social research. Though not constructed {{as part of a}} futures exercise, this framework proved useful for organising the issues that were generated from literature review and brainstorming, provided a stimulus to identify new issues, and was a useful filter for presenting results to the ESRC, which sponsored the study. This range of issues does not just call for interaction between natural and social scientists: there is also need for the sharing of knowledge and perspectives across diverse fields of social science. In order to help inform future research priorities, we need to move beyond the perspectives of single disciplines, and {{make sure that we do}} not simply emphasise those areas where social scientists have already been actively engaged. The study concludes clearly that there is a huge range of vital questions that social science needs to address if we are to understand, let alone bring more social intelligence to bear on shaping, the scientific and technological revolutions that are under way, and their broader social implication...|$|E

While conflict over land rights is a well-known cause of involuntary displacement, revenues from illicit drugs fuel conflict through providing financing for armed groups.

They have least capacity to cope with health problems related to poor water and air quality, food insecurity or economic shocks following natural disasters.

40|$|AbstractCommon global {{societal}} challenges require common answers, also in programming research to help offer those answers. This paper addresses {{the issue of}} priority setting for research programming in a multi-layered and multilateral context, {{taking into account the}} interests of diverse stakeholder groups. It uses a structured FTA approach to offer guidance for the design of foresight exercises supporting such priority setting, drawing on the case of S&T cooperation between EU Member States, countries associated to the FP 7, and Russia. A framework is proposed for <b>thematic</b> <b>priority</b> setting through the application of Future-oriented Technology Analysis (FTA) and for achieving clear policy impacts by including principles for impact optimisation. A combination of foresight methodologies such as expert workshops, a Delphi survey, roadmapping elements, and prioritisation techniques was applied to select relevant topics for a joint research call. The paper shows how foresight can be embedded in a multilateral S&T programme cooperation using a set of coordination dimensions and design principles. Strategies for achieving policy impact and for communicating foresight results are also outlined. Future research is proposed to further improve guidance to facilitate more global research programme cooperation in the future to jointly address global challenges...|$|R
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{application}} of spatial multiple criteria evaluation concepts and methods to support the decision-making process for site selection for waste disposal. The process makes use of a recently developed Spatial Multiple Criteria Evaluation (SMCE) module, integrated into ITC’s existing geographic information system called “ILWIS”. This module supports several compensatory and non-compensatory approaches, allowing inclusion of the spatial and <b>thematic</b> <b>priority</b> of decision makers. To demonstrate the process, a landfill site selection problem around the town of Chinchina, located in the Central Cordillera of the Andes in Colombia (South America), is used as an example. Based on different objectives, a spatial data set is being made available consisting of several maps (slope, land use, geological, landslide distribution etc.) that is used for modeling the site selection process. This study makes use of the planning and decision making framework that is developed at ITC in two major phases. In phase one, Spatial Multiple Criteria Evaluation is used to find potential sites (“design of alternative solutions”). In phase two, the potential sites are evaluated using technical and socio-economic attributes to make the final recommendation of the site (“choice of alternative options”) ...|$|R
