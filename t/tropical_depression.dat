5|$|<b>Tropical</b> <b>Depression</b> Twelve formed {{over the}} southeastern Bahamas at 2100UTC on August23, {{partially}} from {{the remains of}} <b>Tropical</b> <b>Depression</b> Ten. While the normal standards for numbering tropical depressions in the Atlantic stipulate that the initial designation be retained when a depression regenerates, satellite imagery indicated that a second tropical wave had combined with <b>Tropical</b> <b>Depression</b> Ten north of Puerto Rico to form a new, more complex weather system, which was then designated as <b>Tropical</b> <b>Depression</b> Twelve. In post-season reanalysis, {{it was found that}} the low-level circulation of <b>Tropical</b> <b>Depression</b> Ten had completely detached and dissipated; only the remnant mid-level circulation moved on and merged with the second tropical wave. As a result, the criteria for keeping the same name and identity were not met. <b>Tropical</b> <b>Depression</b> Twelve later became Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|A {{short-lived}} <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> {{formed on}} September3 in the South China Sea, dissipating {{the next day}} while moving eastward. There was another short-lived <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> that developed on September4 near the Marianas Islands, but dissipated within one day. Another <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> formed on September4 {{to the west of}} the Marianas Islands, which moved to the south and later northeast, dissipating on September6. On September10, a <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> formed northeast of Luzon, lasting only two days while moving in a circular track.|$|E
5|$|Activity in August {{began when}} a <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> formed on August1 {{to the west}} of Guam. It {{exhibited}} a pababolic track, moving west-northwestward before turning to the south, ultimately dissipating on August4; it never intensified beyond <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> status. Another short-lived <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> formed on August1 near Guam, dissipating on August3 after having moved to the north and west.|$|E
50|$|Tropical {{cyclogenesis}} first {{occurred in}} the month of May, with the development of Subtropical Storm Alpha. The month of June featured three tropical cyclones, including Hurricane Agnes and two <b>tropical</b> <b>depressions.</b> Three more systems formed in July, though all of them failed to reach tropical storm status. August was the most active month of the season, with five systems, including Hurricane Betty, Tropical Storm Carrie, and three <b>tropical</b> <b>depressions.</b> September featured slightly less cyclogenesis, with Hurricane Dawn, Subtropical Storm Charlie, and two <b>tropical</b> <b>depressions.</b> An additional three <b>tropical</b> <b>depressions</b> formed in October. Subtropical Storm Delta was the sole system in November, lasting from November 1 to November 7.|$|R
5|$|There {{were two}} non-developing <b>tropical</b> <b>depressions</b> during the season.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the 1976 season, {{there were}} 11 <b>tropical</b> <b>depressions</b> {{monitored}} {{that did not}} achieve gale intensity.|$|R
5|$|August 28, 1983- <b>Tropical</b> <b>Depression</b> Barry makes {{landfall}} as a <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> near Melbourne. It drops light rainfall {{across the}} southern {{portion of the}} state, peaking at 3.01inches (76mm) in Wauchula.|$|E
5|$|A northwestward moving {{tropical}} wave {{moved out}} the Caribbean Sea on September 1 {{and became a}} <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> on September 2 after crossing southern Florida. Still moving northwestward, the <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> made landfall in southeastern Louisiana on September 4. A building high pressure system over the Central United States forced the <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> to move southwest over the Gulf of Mexico. The warm waters then cause the depression to reach tropical storm strength and the storm was given the name Fern by the National Hurricane Center on September 7.|$|E
5|$|A {{report from}} Mexico {{indicates}} that a <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> formed off the west coasts of Tabasco and Coatzacoalcos. The depression significantly impacted the northern portions of Veracruz with heavy rainfall on June30. However, the Atlantic hurricane best track does not list this system as a <b>tropical</b> <b>depression.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the storms listed above, the China Meteorological Agency also monitored seven other <b>tropical</b> <b>depressions.</b>|$|R
40|$|Tropical {{disturbances}} {{over the}} South China Sea (SCS) {{during the period}} of 1997 - 2006 are analyzed using the Tropical Storm and Hurricane WX products. A total of 158 tropical disturbances were formed over the SCS from 1997 to 2006, with 54 developing tropical disturbances which developed into <b>tropical</b> <b>depressions</b> and 104 non-developing tropical disturbances which never developed into <b>tropical</b> <b>depressions.</b> The development rate of tropical disturbances into <b>tropical</b> <b>depressions</b> was 34. 18 % in these ten years. During the period of this study, total annual numbers of tropical disturbances and developing tropical disturbances over the SCS had significant decreasing trends; however, the development rate of tropical disturbances had an insignificant increasing trend. © 2011 Science Press, Ocean University of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
50|$|In the Central Pacific, {{the local}} {{hurricane}} center noted four systems that were likely <b>tropical</b> <b>depressions</b> but not operationally monitored.|$|R
5|$|A {{squall line}} which moved {{offshore}} New York and southern New England formed a mesoscale convective vortex, which fired new thunderstorm activity each day {{as it moved}} within the westerlies across the northern Atlantic. Once it reached mid-ocean, an increasingly northerly steering flow dropped the system down into the subtropics {{to the east of}} Bermuda, and it maintained decent organization. By 2100UTC on July 24, the National Hurricane Center began classifying the system as <b>Tropical</b> <b>Depression</b> Two. In the first advisory on the depression, it was noted that the previous <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> was erroneously classified as <b>Tropical</b> <b>Depression</b> Two.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather {{formed on}} August 26, 2003 and drifted westward. The disturbed weather {{then began to}} organize and the system became a <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> on August 28. Moving westward over waters greater than 82°F (28°C), <b>Tropical</b> <b>Depression</b> Ten-E rapidly strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Jimena by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|At {{the tenth}} RA I {{tropical}} cyclone committee held during 1991, it was {{recommended that the}} intensity classifications be changed ahead of the 1993–94 tropical cyclone season. Specifically {{it was decided that}} the classifications: Weak <b>Tropical</b> <b>Depression,</b> Moderate <b>Tropical</b> <b>Depression</b> and Severe <b>Tropical</b> <b>Depression</b> would be changed to <b>Tropical</b> <b>Depression,</b> Moderate Tropical Storm and Severe Tropical Storm. This change was implemented ahead of the 1993–94 tropical cyclone season. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also monitors the basin, and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the United States Government. These warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, however, regardless of intensity in this basin the JTWC labels all systems as tropical cyclones.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, the {{archives}} format was significantly changed to include non-synoptic best track times, non-developing <b>tropical</b> <b>depressions</b> and wind radii.|$|R
5000|$|Tropical Storms {{formed in}} the entire west pacific basin were {{assigned}} a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. <b>Tropical</b> <b>depressions</b> in this basin have the [...] "W" [...] suffix added to their number. <b>Tropical</b> <b>depressions</b> that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA. This can often result in the same storm having two names.|$|R
50|$|The China Meteorological Administration also {{monitored}} {{a severe}} tropical storm {{and several other}} <b>tropical</b> <b>depressions</b> {{during the course of}} the season.|$|R
5|$|August 30, 2004– <b>Tropical</b> <b>Depression</b> Gaston {{traverses}} the state, bringing moderate precipitation {{which causes}} some flooding.|$|E
5|$|Bilis {{made its}} first {{landfall}} in northern Taiwan on July 13, with an intensity of 55kt (100km/h, 65mph). After moving across northern Taiwan, Bilis made its second landfall in Fujian, China early on July 14 at the same intensity, then weakened into a <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> over land the next day. Bilis lingered as a <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> over southeastern China before degenerating into a remnant low on July 16. But the JMA carried {{the system as a}} <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> until July 17. Despite becoming a remnant low, the remnants of Bilis maintained their identity for several days while moving westward over China, bringing heavy rains to inland areas.|$|E
5|$|Darby, now losing {{tropical}} characteristics, was downgraded to a <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> on July 9.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the named systems, there were nine <b>tropical</b> <b>depressions</b> or disturbances tracked by the MFR, and several by other agencies.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the Pacific typhoons in 1962 formed in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and west of the International Date Line with two exceptions: <b>Tropical</b> <b>Depressions</b> Fifty and Sixty-three formed in the Central Pacific. Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 1962 Pacific hurricane season. All <b>tropical</b> <b>depressions</b> are assigned a number. Most systems reaching tropical storm strength were assigned a name; all typhoons were named.|$|R

5|$|Early on September 11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{an area of}} convection roughly 1,100km (700mi) east of Guam. A broad, low-level circulation center {{had formed}} within the system and became increasingly organized, showing signs of developing convective banding. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was released later that day as convection was rapidly consolidating around the low, which was embedded within {{the eastern end of}} the monsoonal trough. It was then declared as a <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the JTWC with the latter designating it as <b>Tropical</b> <b>Depression</b> 15W The <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> was tracking westward along the southern edge of the subtropical ridge situated east of the international dateline.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ida {{originated}} from a weak tropical wave that reached the western Caribbean on November1, 2009. By November2, the system spawned {{an area of}} low pressure north of Panama which moved very little over the following days. The low became increasingly organized within a favorable environment that allowed deep convection to develop. By November4, the low had become sufficiently organized for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to classify it as <b>Tropical</b> <b>Depression</b> Eleven. At this time, the <b>tropical</b> <b>depression</b> was situated just southwest of San Andrés Island. Convective banding features became increasingly defined throughout the day, and six hours after becoming a <b>tropical</b> <b>depression,</b> the system intensified into Tropical Storm Ida.|$|E

50|$|During the 1967 Pacific typhoon season, 40 <b>{{tropical}}</b> <b>depressions</b> formed, {{of which}} 35 became tropical storms. Twenty tropical storms attained typhoon intensity, {{and five of}} the typhoons reached super typhoon intensity.|$|R
50|$|The {{rest of the}} storms, such as {{unnumbered}} and unnamed <b>tropical</b> <b>depressions</b> and storms, {{are only}} classified by the CMA while the JMA is sometimes rare before the 1960s - 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Also of note: <b>tropical</b> <b>depressions,</b> <b>tropical</b> storms, and hurricanes gain {{strength}} from, {{but are not}} steered by, {{the temperature}} of the water. They are steered by the atmosphere, and the atmospheric level involved in steering a hurricane is different at different intensities (i.e., it relates to the minimum pressure of the hurricane).|$|R
