5|$|As {{a result}} of the planned extension, the two tracks {{continue}} east of this station for about 700 feet along 205th Street to Webster Avenue, ending at a concrete wall, and this station does not have any crew quarters. Crews are changed at Bedford Park Boulevard, the next station south. Additionally, there is no diamond crossover between the tracks west of this station; here, a center track forms leading west to the Concourse Yard. Because of this, terminating trains arrive on the southern (railroad northbound) track and discharge their passengers before continuing east {{to the end of the}} track. They then use the diamond crossover there to return to this station on the northern (railroad southbound) track and begin service to Manhattan and Brooklyn. Due to the <b>track</b> <b>configuration,</b> trains may reverse into the yard from the southern track, and trains from the yard may start service on the northern track.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{extension}} to Dulwich Hill, a stabling facility for four light rail vehicles (LRVs) {{was built in the}} cutting, {{to the west of the}} stop. The <b>track</b> <b>configuration</b> through the stop was also redesigned. In November 2013, the outbound platform was brought into use and the points at the city end were removed. A new crossover past the outbound end of the stop was installed to enable terminating trams to switch tracks and to provide access to the stabling facility.|$|E
25|$|LZB {{consists}} of equipment {{on the line}} {{as well as on}} the trains. A 30–40km segment of track is controlled by a LZB control center. The control center computer receives information about occupied blocks from track circuits or axle counters and locked routes from interlockings. It is programmed with the <b>track</b> <b>configuration</b> including the location of points, turnouts, gradients, and curve speed limits. With this, it has sufficient information to calculate how far each train may proceed and at what speed.|$|E

50|$|The Collector's Edition for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 {{added another}} 5 new cars, twelve new circuits, and sprint and {{checkpoint}} <b>track</b> <b>configurations.</b> Also included were specially tuned versions of ten existing cars, plus 35 exclusive vinyls for adding a unique visual style.|$|R
25|$|The {{railway station}} has 4 {{platforms}} {{and a short}} bay that was previously used for the Red Star parcels facility. Platform 1 has a run-round facility for locomotive hauled trains (mainly freight services). The track layout and associated signalling was remodelled {{during the course of}} a week-long engineering blockade from 25 October to 3 November 2008 to permit higher speeds on both routes into the station and also allow trains to approach the station from both Leeds and Halifax simultaneously (something that was not possible with the old <b>track</b> <b>configuration).</b>|$|E
500|$|Pilots are {{required}} to complete the [...] long track and fly between the Air Gates following a predetermined race <b>track</b> <b>configuration.</b> Failure to do this correctly results in penalty seconds being added to their race time. Penalty seconds can be added for an incorrect passing of an Air Gate or passing an Air Gate at an incorrect orientation. For more serious breaches of the rules, pilots may be ruled as [...] "Did Not Finish" [...] or disqualified.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{of track}} is made {{primarily}} of layers of laminated wood, with a steel plate {{located in the}} upper layers of the track. The steel plating is known as Topper Track and is found on many roller coasters that Rocky Mountain Construction has renovated. This track style is designed to reduce the maintenance typically required for a wooden roller coaster {{and to provide a}} smoother ride experience. Rocky Mountain Construction spent four years developing technology to allow them to twist beams of wood, that make up the lower layers of the track. This <b>track</b> <b>configuration</b> allows for more dynamic roller coaster elements to be performed on a wooden roller coaster.|$|E
50|$|During Daytona Beach Bike Week, a supercross {{track is}} built between pit {{road and the}} tri-oval section of the track.

50|$|GeoTrax {{train set}} layouts come in beginner, intermediate, {{advanced}} and expert levels, and are built around playset Rail, Construction, Rescue, Elevation and Air and Sea focal point toys. GeoTrax's appeal {{is due in}} part to the number of possible <b>track</b> <b>configurations</b> that can be created with interchangeable track and playsets. GeoTrax is known for its Snap-Lock track which can be locked together or taken apart to create a multitude of <b>track</b> <b>configurations.</b> Layouts can be set up flat or using elevated tracks, and can incorporate curves, ramps and bridges. Some adult assembly is needed to build the track layouts. The assembly process sometimes involves using a Phillips screwdriver and snapping tracks together to create multiple play levels. Users can learn to build a number of prescribed layouts by visiting the GeoTrax site which shows pieces and sets used in each layout and printable pictures of the layouts.|$|R

2500|$|The train dispatches {{from the}} station, during this audio {{of a man}} saying [...] "join us" [...] is played and the ride {{immediately}} enters into a sweeping drop 180-degrees to the left. Partway through this drop, riders encounter a heartline roll, the ride's first inversion. The train then {{comes to a stop}} on block brakes, before ascending the first lift hill. Upon reaching the top, the train drops into another 180-degree right turn before banking into the second inversion, a downward corkscrew. The train drops straight down into the next two inversions – two consecutive dive loops – before travelling over an airtime hill into a third Dive loop. Upon exiting the dive loop, the train traverses a sidewinder before entering a reverse sidewinder, which has the same <b>track</b> <b>configuration</b> as a sidewinder, however the trains travel through it in the opposite direction. The ride then travels through another corkscrew before reaching the second set of block brakes.|$|E

50|$|The roadcourse {{is able to}} be used in {{multiple}} configurations. It can be run in either clockwise or counter clockwise directions, with 2 configurations each. The longer course is 1.4 mi and includes a tight set of esses and a chicane. The shorter course deletes the esses and chicane and is 1.1 mi. The result is effectively 4 different <b>track</b> <b>configurations</b> for racing.|$|R

5000|$|Rolling ball sculptures, {{typically}} {{marketed as}} [...] "marble runs" [...] are commonly sold as children's toys worldwide. Unlike professional kinetic sculptures, however, their commercial counterparts are typically {{made of wood}} or plastic and feature small, interlocking pieces that can generate {{a large number of}} <b>track</b> <b>configurations.</b> More complicated add-ons, such as jumps, loops, trampolines, xylophone ramps and electronic triggers are also typical with more complex sets.|$|R
40|$|The {{orientation}} is a main factor which {{can influence the}} final output of the photovoltaic array systems. A computer-based analyzing method is used to study effects of different orientations and compare outputs to choose the possible configuration method which is best fitting to Sri Lanka. The output was considered for a flat, a tilted, a south facing, a north facing, and both one and two axis tracking arrays. "RETScreen" software was used for analyzing of different orientations. Five geographical locations were selected {{to account for the}} entire country. Product data and metrological data were taken from the software database, and thirteen configurations were used for the calculations. The simulation results show that, two axis tracking system and south facing with latitude angel photovoltaic arrays give the maximum energy outputs among the axis <b>tracking</b> <b>configurations</b> and fixed array configurations respectively. The one axis tracking system and the south facing with latitude angle-array systems are the most suitable axis <b>tracking</b> <b>configuration</b> and fixed array configuration method respectively for Sri Lanka. Financial study is necessary to decide on the best method among these two...|$|R
