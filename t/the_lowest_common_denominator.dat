This concept is applied to motivation by observing that all productive systems [...] whether physical, organic or social [...] are input-output systems. <b>The</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominators</b> in these systems are energy and mass. Le Chatelier's principle provides the universal environment for motivation. Thus, the transformation of energy in a given productive system represents the essence of motivation. The usefulness of analogizing the process of energy transformation in these two seemingly diverse systems can be seen by tracing the essential factors leading to efficient energy expenditure is physical systems and applying similar strategies to energy transformation in social system. Such an approach will provide the manager with a concrete frame of reference from which to draw plausible remedies in solving the innumerable problems of efficient motivation and utilization of employee energies. ...|$|R

In Israel, a party must win 61 seats in order to achieve a majority. This has not yet occurred in Israel’s history, meaning each ruling government has been composed of party coalitions. Since 1965 Israel had been on a path of party oversimplification, with political parties abandoning attempts to frame moral issues in favor of spreading wider nets to catch a bigger range of voters.

40|$|With a fuel {{consumption}} {{of up to}} 150 tons {{a day for a}} containership, fuel cost is the main expense for shippers. To decrease expenses, drag reduction is the most important topic to address. The biggest factor that influence the hydrodynamics of a vessel is marine fouling. A heavily fouled ship can consume an additional 40 % of fuel, or more (1). The process of marine fouling is an extremely diverse and complex issue, involving more than 4000 marine fouling species (2) that interact with the vessel surface. On top of that, the microbiological environment is dramatically different between different regions {{of the world and the}} oceans. Marine antifouling suppliers push development in order to meet the demands from shippers all around the world requiring constantly higher and higher performance. The development is directed towards achieving better performance but it is also controlled by regulations. To be able to meet future demands, new laws and regulations has to be monitored, understood and considered. Biological systems are being studied for inspiration and more novel and complex solutions are constantly emerging. The solutions have shifted from only tackling hard macrofouling to also focus on preventing the biofilm from forming. Stricter regulations mean that the environmental considerations become more and more important for the shipping industry. The positive effects of antifouling solutions on lowered exhaust gas emission have to be balanced in relation to its environmental load arising from biocidal release. Especially since the shipping fleet is behind some of the worst exhaust emissions in the world. In this work, today’s antifouling solutions have been researched, compared and stripped, to more easily see <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominators</b> in order to predict a future solution.

50|$|Not all {{for profit}} {{companies}} used short term financial incentives at levels below {{the president or}} very top executive levels. The trend to move financial incentives down the organization hierarchy started in the 1980s {{as a way to}} boost what was considered low productivity. Prior to that time the incentives were associated more with customer satisfaction and producing high quality products. Moving financial incentives down the corporate chain had the unintended consequences of subverting internal processes to save short term costs, forcing obsolescence at the lower levels as investment was deferred or abandoned, and lowering quality. Some of these issues are explored in the British documentary The Trap.

40|$|In Sweden, the {{industrial}} housing trade has developed {{for many years}} with the salient idea of improving production control through an increased level of prefabrication. However, production variability is a consistent issue as work is still sub-optimised, resulting in a fragmented production process. Consequently, problems arise when prefabricated parts and components are assembled. The building services are often a source of high variability (many different components and subcontractors), leading to reduced production control. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present how modularisations can provide prerequisites for production control in service system design. So far, modularisation has only rendered little attention in Lean construction. In this paper, a modularisation development effort of five Swedish industrial housing ompanies is reported. To generate a relevant set of modules, several workshops were held together with company representatives and building service consultants. The Design Structure Matrix (DSM) was used to detect <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> geometrical <b>denominator</b> of <b>the</b> building service systems as well as crucial connection points and interfaces.

40|$|AbstractThe {{breadth of}} {{behaviours}} {{that may be}} considered as cluttering continues to be contentious. <b>The</b> current <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominator</b> (LCD) definition of cluttering excludes the possibility of high level language deficits. However, recent studies suggest that those who clutter may have linguistic deficits alongside motor control difficulties. This paper reports behavioural findings from a larger data set collected during functional MRI scans with adults who clutter (AWC), adults who stutter (AWS) and controls (CTLs). Participants were asked to read short passages aloud and describe pictures. Speech data were analysed and coded for stuttering like dysfluencies (e. g. blocks) and normal dysfluencies (e. g. revisions and fillers) by two speech and language therapists. One-way ANOVAs showed that AWC use significantly more revisions than AWS and CTLs both when reading aloud and when describing pictures. AWC showed a trend toward increased co-articulation when describing a picture compared to AWS and CTL although this failed to meet significance level, AWC speaking rates was evaluated as similar to the two other groups. Results suggest that both spontaneous speech and oral reading outputs of AWC can be differentiated from AWS and CTL {{by the number of}} revisions used. We speculate that excessive co-articulation might differentiate AWC from AWS and CTLs in spontaneous speech but this does not appear to hold true for oral reading...|$|R
