5|$|Obliquity of <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> is {{the term}} used by astronomers for the {{inclination}} of Earth's equator with respect to <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic,</b> or of Earth's rotation axis to a perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic.</b> It is about 23.4° and is currently decreasing 0.013 degrees (47 arcseconds) per hundred years due to planetary perturbations.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ecliptic</b> forms {{one of the}} two {{fundamental}} planes used as reference for positions on the celestial sphere, the other being the celestial equator. Perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> are <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> poles, the north ecliptic pole being the pole north of the equator. Of the {{two fundamental}} planes, <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> is closer to unmoving against the background stars, its motion due to planetary precession being roughly 1/100 that of the celestial equator.|$|E
5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic.</b> If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic,</b> crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> north <b>ecliptic</b> pole {{is located}} at right {{ascension}} 18h and declination +66.5°. This is located roughly midway between Delta Draconis and Zeta Draconis. <b>The</b> north <b>ecliptic</b> pole almost coincides with the south celestial pole of Venus; Zeta Draconis is also the north pole star of Jupiter.|$|R
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> and the Sun is always very near <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic,</b> eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, but only when the Moon is near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. <b>The</b> <b>ecliptic</b> is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E
5|$|Ecliptic {{coordinates}} are {{convenient for}} specifying positions of Solar System objects, {{as most of}} the planets' orbits have small inclinations to <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic,</b> and therefore always appear relatively close to it on the sky. Because Earth's orbit, and hence <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic,</b> moves very little, it is a relatively fixed reference with respect to the stars.|$|E
5|$|Spherical coordinates, {{known as}} {{ecliptic}} longitude and latitude or celestial longitude and latitude, {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere with respect to <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic.</b> Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> from the vernal equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic,</b> to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic,</b> <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the x-axis is directed toward the vernal equinox, the y-axis 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is the unit of measure. Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|E

5|$|Most {{asteroid}}s {{within the}} asteroid belt have orbital eccentricities of less than 0.4, and an inclination of less than 30°. The orbital distribution of the asteroids reaches a maximum at an eccentricity of around 0.07 and an inclination below 4°. Thus although a typical asteroid has a relatively circular orbit and lies near the plane of <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic,</b> some asteroid orbits can be highly eccentric or travel well outside <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> plane.|$|E
5|$|Most large {{objects in}} orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic.</b> The planets {{are very close to}} <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic,</b> whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects are {{frequently}} at significantly greater angles to it. All the planets, and most other objects, orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole). There are exceptions, such as Halley's Comet.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the major}} bodies of the Solar System orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane. This is likely due {{to the way in}} which the Solar System formed from a protoplanetary disk. Probably the closest current {{representation}} of the disk is known as the invariable plane of the Solar System. Earth's orbit, and hence, <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic,</b> is inclined a little more than 1° to the invariable plane, and the other major planets are also within about 6° of it. Because of this, most Solar System bodies appear very close to <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> in the sky. <b>The</b> <b>ecliptic</b> is well defined by the motion of the Sun. The invariable plane is defined by the angular momentum of the entire Solar System, essentially the summation of all of the orbital motions and rotations of all the bodies of the system, a somewhat uncertain value that requires precise knowledge of every object in the system. For these reasons, <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> is used as the reference plane of the Solar System out of convenience.|$|E

5|$|Pluto's {{orbital period}} is {{presently}} about 248 years. Its orbital characteristics are substantially {{different from those}} of the planets, which follow nearly circular orbits around the Sun close to a flat reference plane called <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic.</b> In contrast, Pluto's orbit is moderately inclined relative to <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> (over 17°) and moderately eccentric (elliptical). This eccentricity means a small region of Pluto's orbit lies nearer the Sun than Neptune's. The Pluto–Charon barycenter came to perihelion on September 5, 1989, and was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7, 1979, and February 11, 1999.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's {{orbit around}} the Earth is {{inclined}} at an angle of just over 5 degrees to {{the plane of the}} Earth's {{orbit around the}} Sun (<b>the</b> <b>ecliptic).</b> Because of this, at the time of a new moon, the Moon will usually pass to the north or south of the Sun. A solar eclipse can occur only when new moon occurs close to one of the points (known as nodes) where the Moon's orbit crosses <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{equatorial}} ring {{goes around}} {{the belly of the}} armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (degrees) away from the pole. The circle of <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> is 67 (degrees) and a fraction away from the pole, while at the winter solstice it is 115 (degrees) and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away. The former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the (results obtained by the) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia (dynasty) calendar.|$|E

5|$|The {{orientation}} of Earth's axis and equator are not fixed in space, but rotate about the poles of <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> with {{a period of}} about 26,000 years, a process known as lunisolar precession, as it is due mostly to the gravitational effect of the Moon and Sun on Earth's equatorial bulge. Likewise, <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> itself is not fixed. The gravitational perturbations of the other bodies of the Solar System cause a much smaller motion of the plane of Earth's orbit, and hence of <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic,</b> known as planetary precession. The combined action of these two motions is called general precession, and changes the position of the equinoxes by about 50 arc seconds (about 0.014°) per year.|$|E
5|$|With {{a visual}} {{magnitude}} of 17.3, Haumea is the third-brightest {{object in the}} Kuiper belt after Pluto and , and easily observable with a large amateur telescope. However, because the planets and most small Solar System bodies share a common orbital alignment from their formation in the primordial disk of the Solar System, most early surveys for distant objects focused on the projection on the sky of this common plane, called <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic.</b> As the region of sky close to <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> became well explored, later sky surveys began looking for objects that had been dynamically excited into orbits with higher inclinations, {{as well as more}} distant objects, with slower mean motions across the sky. These surveys eventually covered the location of Haumea, with its high orbital inclination and current position far from <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic.</b>|$|E
5|$|At its fullest extent (but {{excluding}} the scattered disc), including its outlying regions, the Kuiper belt stretches from roughly 30 to 55 AU. The {{main body of}} the belt is generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 mean-motion resonance (see below) at 39.5 AU to the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU. The Kuiper belt is quite thick, with the main concentration extending as much as ten degrees outside <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> plane and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times farther. Overall it more resembles a torus or doughnut than a belt. Its mean position is inclined to <b>the</b> <b>ecliptic</b> by 1.86 degrees.|$|E
