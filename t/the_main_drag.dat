In contrast to other cities in the United States that prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes of Saline County began to quickly diminish. Harry Truman stopped briefly in Harrisburg during his whistlestop tour in September 30, 1948, giving some hope for economic recovery for the region.

25|$|After 1910 steady {{population}} decline {{was driven}} {{by the lack of}} significant population in outlying areas, migration to larger urban centers, and the absence of dynamic economic factors to generate wealth. The hardware store closed in 1928 and the bank, like thousands of other undercapitalized small-town banks in the United States, went out of business in 1929 or 1930 {{in the aftermath of the}} stock market crash of 1929. U.S. Census bureau data indicates that the population fell to 102 in 1920, 80 in 1930, rose slightly to 89 in 1940, and fell to 62 in 1950, 35 in 1960 and 24 in 1970. As local establishments burned down or went out of business they were not replaced, and finally the post office was discontinued in 1980 when the census bureau pegged Tenney's population at 19. Today the only remaining business in town is the elevator. The only commercial building remaining on <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>drag</b> is the former James Bigsby general store, later the G.A.

This could possibly be achieved in near wall turbulent flow by suppressing wall-mode instabilities (i. e., by interfering with the seeding mechanism of turbulence production). Wall-mode instabilities can be studied by applying hydrodynamic stability theory to wall bounded turbulent flows. It has been shown in Sen & Veeravalli, 2000 (Sadhana, 25, 423 - 437) that an anisotropic eddy viscosity model is crucial in capturing the wall mode instabilities. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> results of this theory are discussed and we present detailed experimental investigations carried out with the objective of verifying the Sen & Veeravalli theory...|$|R
5000|$|Through his {{promotion}} of Houston's Orange Show art car events including the parade, art car seminars and <b>the</b> <b>Main</b> Street <b>Drag</b> (an event which brings art cars to schools) Harrod helped to bring art cars {{into the world}} of education where they became the focus of hands on workshops in schools across the country.

Soon communities of art car artists sprung up in many eastern states and throughout the country. Some of these communities then partnered with local organizations such as schools, arts councils, and museums to create their own art car events mirroring those held in Houston. Through Blank's work artcars started appearing in television commercials and as [...] "drive ons" [...] in movies much more often than the past.

30|$|Third, and finally, {{there is}} the role of {{investment}} variety. Input price distortions were probably <b>the</b> <b>main</b> trade-related <b>drag</b> on Argentina’s growth in the twentieth century. After 1914, and particularly from the 1930 s to the 1950 s, this scenario could be ascribed in some large part to highly unfavorable global conditions for open trade; but once global trade started to boom thereafter, self-inflicted trade policy distortions would remain as the principal cause of the problem. The estimate presented above (0.200 log income points) may also be an understatement since it focuses only on the so-called “intensive margin”—the quantity of a given set of goods imported. But recent empirical research in the trade literature suggests that comparable economic costs may be inflicted by input tariffs on the “extensive margin”—by limiting the variety of inputs that are imported. If these results carry over to intermediate and capital inputs, as they well might, then we would have identified yet another trade-related barrier to investment. Quantifying that impact for a broad range of countries, as well as for Argentina itself, remains an important goal of future research.|$|R
