50|$|It was {{too late}} to move the <b>theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> to Lithuania. On 4 February, a 115,000 strong Russian army under Field Marshal Hans Karl von Diebitsch crossed the Polish borders. The first major battle took place on 14 February 1831, close to the village of Stoczek near Łuków. In the Battle of Stoczek, Polish cavalry under Brigadier Józef Dwernicki {{defeated}} the Russian division of Teodor Geismar. However, the victory had mostly psychological value and could not stop the Russian advance towards Warsaw. The subsequent battles of Dobre, Wawer and Białołęka were inconclusive.|$|E

Until March last, the region was quiet. The crimes which have come to our knowledge fall within the last two months (end of March to the 15th May). They are subsequent to the retreat of the Greek army after the defeat of Eski Shehir Önü. Possibly they are a consequence of it." [...] - Maurice Gehri ...|$|E
50|$|For eight years, (1621 - 1629), the {{exhausting}} and expensive Polish War dragged on. Swedish Livonia was conquered {{by the beginning}} of 1626, and the <b>theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> was transferred to the Prussian provinces of Poland. The fertile and easily defensible delta of the Vistula was now occupied and Gustavus treated it as a permanent conquest, making his great Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna its first Governor-General. But this was the limit of the Swedish advance. All Gustavus's further efforts were frustrated by the superior strategy of the Polish hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, and in June 1629, the king gladly accepted the lucrative Treaty of Altmark. By this truce Sweden was, for six years, to retain possession of its Livonian conquests, besides holding Elbing, the Vistula delta, and Braunsberg in West Prussia, and Pillau and Memel in East Prussia, with the right to levy tolls at Pillau, Memel, Danzig, Libau and Windau. From these tolls Gustavus derived, in 1629 alone, 500,000 Riksdalers, a sum equivalent to the whole of the extraordinary subsidies granted to him by the Riksdag.|$|E

5000|$|Hitherto Charles had {{aimed at}} {{supporting}} the weaker Slavonic power against the stronger; {{but now that}} Russia seemed about to disappear from among the nations of Europe, Swedish statesmen naturally sought some compensation for the expenses of the war before Poland had had time to absorb everything. A beginning {{was made by the}} siege and capture of County of Kexholm in Russian Finland March 2, 1611; and on July 16, Great Novgorod was occupied and a convention concluded with the magistrates of that wealthy city whereby Charles IX's second son Philip was to be recognized as tsar, unless in the meantime, relief came to Great Novgorod from Moscow. But now, when everything depended on a concentration of forces, Charles's imprudent assumption of the title of [...] "King of the Lapps of Nordland" [...] which people properly belonged to the Danish Crown, involved him in another war with Denmark, a war known in Scandinavian history as the Kalmar War because the Swedish fortress of Kalmar was the chief <b>theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities.</b> Thus the Swedish forces were diverted from their real objective and transferred to another field where even victory would have been comparatively unprofitable. But it was disaster, not victory, which Charles IX of Sweden reaped from this foolhardy enterprise.|$|E
40|$|The present European war {{has thrown}} into sharp relief {{the status of}} those smaller governments which, {{although}} in nowise shorn of attributes of sovereignty within their own borders, have nevertheless been placed by virtue of most solemn inter-national guarantees {{in a position of}} perpetual neutrality towards all other Powers. They are not to wage offensive warfare, nor, if the obligations resulting from these guarantees are faithfully observed, may their territories be in any degree the <b>theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities.</b> While the chief examples of this peculiar status,- Belgium, Luxemburg and Switzerland,-are plainly, by reason of restricted area and population, in no condition to cope with the greater powers surrounding them, it is not alone their lack of size or strength that has marked them out for permanent neutrality or neutralization, but rather their essential relation to the map of Europe and the many conflicting interests innate in its geographical outlines which have seemed to make neces-sary their fixed withdrawal from plans of rivalry or territorial ambition and the creation in this manner of certain inter-spaces destined for peace whatever may be the fate of their more powerful neighbors...|$|E

40|$|High levels <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> {{present a}} {{formidable}} challenge among homeless ex-offenders. This cross-sectional study assessed correlates of high levels <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> using baseline data collected on recently-released male parolees (n = 472; age 18 - 60) {{participating in a}} randomized trial focused on prevention of illicit drug use and recidivism. Predictors of high levels <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> included greater depressive symptomatology, lower self-esteem, having a mother who was treated for alcohol/drugs, belonging to a gang, more tangible support, having used methamphetamine and having a history of cognitive difficulties. These findings highlight the need to understand predictors <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> among recently released homeless men and how these predictors may relate to recidivism. Research im plications are discussed, as these findings will shape future nurse-led harm reduction and community-based interventions. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
