50|$|There are {{multiple}} and intense regulatory battles over triple-play services, as incumbent <b>telcos</b> and incumbent cable operators {{attempt to keep}} out new competitors; since both industries historically have been regulated monopolies, regulatory capture has long been as much a core competency for them as have been prices and terms of service. Cable providers want to compete with <b>telcos</b> for local voice service, but want to discourage <b>telcos</b> from competing with them for television service. Incumbent <b>telcos</b> want to deliver television service but want to block competition for voice service from cable operators. Both industries cloak their demands for favorable regulatory treatment in claims that their positions favor the public interests.|$|R

40|$|CD-Rom included; A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for the MSc in Computer ScienceABSTRACT International telecommunication has become a very important sector in the present day communication. IDD traffic {{is one of the}} main sources of revenue for national telecommunication service providers (<b>Telcos).</b> Hence, it has to be managed properly and driven effectively to gain maximum profit. / <b>Telco’s</b> usually deal with multiple international operators (carriers) e. g. SingTel, Telstra, in order to use latter's networks for international traffic. These carriers offer different charging structures which vary with the time, volume and the destination. Most <b>Telcos</b> incur high costs due to lack of a proper system to analyse and forecast an optimized IDD routing plan. / Therefore, a system which is capable of producing a cost-effective routing plan by analyzing the current IDD usage pattern and the traffic cost would be much beneficial for all <b>Telco’s.</b> The objective of this research work is to find a suitable methodology for <b>Telcos</b> to produce a cost-effective routing plan for the IDD traffic in near real time. In our approach, the main tasks are, • Forecasting the IDD traffic pattern to each destination • Determining the optimized routing plan. Forecasting the future traffic was based on past traffic, current IDD traffic trend and the subscriber growth rate of <b>Telcos.</b> A Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used to obtain the optimized routing plan. Dynamic behavior of the problem domain was successfully addressed in the GA structure. / The GA parameters, population size, number of generations and the GA operations (crossover, mutation and reproduction) ratio were determined experimentally. Experimental results show that our solution is capable of producing a cost-effective routing plan in near-real-time which reduces the cost by 30 % to 50 % against the manual routing plan. Our solution could be used by national <b>Telco’s</b> to save significant costs in the international traffic and to pass some of that cost savings to their customers...|$|R

25|$|The {{convergence}} of content, technology, and broadband access allows consumers to stream television shows and movies to their high-definition television {{in competition with}} traditional service providers (Cable TV and Satellite Television). The research company SNL Kagan expects 12 million households, roughly 10%, to go without cable, satellite or <b>telco</b> video service by 2015 using Over The Top services. This represents a new trend in the broadcast television industry, as the list of options for watching movies and TV over the Internet grows every day. Research also shows that even as traditional television service providers are trimming their customer base, they are adding Broadband Internet customers. Nearly 76.6 million U.S. households get broadband from leading cable and telephone companies, although only a portion have sufficient speeds to support quality video streaming. Convergence devices for home entertainment will likely play a much larger role {{in the future of}} broadcast television, effectively shifting traditional revenue streams while providing consumers with more options.|$|E
