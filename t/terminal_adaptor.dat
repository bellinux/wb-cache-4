50|$|DrayTek (Traditional Chinese: 居易科技) is a {{manufacturer}} of broadband CPE (Customer Premises Equipment), including firewalls, VPN devices, routers and wireless LAN devices. The company was founded in 1997 {{by a team of}} experienced engineers who decided to form their own company and create what they feel are superior network products. Their earliest products included ISDN based solutions, the first being the ISDN Vigor128, a USB <b>terminal</b> <b>adaptor</b> for Windows and Mac OS. This was followed by the ISDN Vigor204 ISDN terminal adaptor/PBX and Vigor2000, their first router. Their head office is in Hsinchu, Taiwan with regional offices and distributors worldwide.|$|E

The aim of the project is to realize a flexible experimentation environment to investigate the critical {{issues related to the}} introduction of ATM techniques in the network, including signalling, interworking and service support, in addition to the basic switching technology.

40|$|In {{order to}} take {{advantage}} of the low entry cost of the future public ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) network with shared facilities, it is highly desirable to interconnect different hosts and local area networks (LANs) to the ATM network. The interface between the computer hosts or LANs and the ATM network, commonly called a broadband <b>terminal</b> <b>adaptor</b> (BTA), provides the necessary format conversion for the data packets and the ATM cells. It is conceivable that multiple packets from different virtual channels are interleaved as they arrive at the receive-end BTA. The BTA must have a sufficiently large buffer, called a virtual channel queue (VCQ), to temporarily store the partially received packets. Once a complete packet has been received, it is forwarded to the host or LAN. Whenever the buffer fills with all incomplete packets, a packet must be discarded to make room for others. In this paper, we first study, through computer simulations, the buffer size requirement of a shared-memory VCQ for different numbers of virtual channels at various packet loss probabilities. We then present two different implementation architectures for the shared-memory VCQ, and compare their hardware complexity. The second architecture with linked-queue approach, adopted in our work, requires less buffer and has better scalability to accommodate a large number of virtual channels. Various possible error conditions, such as cell losses in the ATM network and the VCQ buffer overflow, are considered. Corresponding solutions are proposed and included in the VCQ designs. 1...|$|E
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{peripherals}} were available that worked on {{some or all of}} these models. The first line, introduced with the 4010, included the 4610 Hard Copy Unit, a graphics printer. This used a system in the monitor to scan the display line-by-line which was then sent to the printer where a second one-line tall CRT duplicated the image on thermal paper. Normally selling for $3,550, a $3,950 version allowed the printer to be shared among four <b>terminals.</b> The <b>adaptor</b> could be pre-installed in the 4010, making it the 4010-1, and it came pre-installed on both the 4012 and 4013 which do not appear to have used the -1 notation to indicate this. The 4631 was a version of the 4610 with a sheet feeder and higher speed. A properly equipped 4014 could also drive a plotter through an expansion card, including the GPIB-based 4662 Interactive Digital Plotter and 4663 C-sized version. Plotters offered colored pen selection, which could be embedded in the graphics data.|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been known that the {{maintenance}} of fast communication between neurons requires that presynaptic terminals recycle the small vesicles from which neurotransmitter is released. But the mechanisms that retrieve vesicles from the cell surface are still not understood. Although we have a wealth of information about the molecular details of endocytosis in non-neuronal cells, it is clear that endocytosis at the synapse is faster and regulated in distinct ways. A satisfying understanding of these processes will require molecular events to be manipulated while observing endocytosis in living synapses. Here, we review recent work that seeks {{to bridge the gap between}} physiology and molecules to unravel the endocytic machinery operating at the synaptic <b>terminal.</b> Key words: <b>adaptors,</b> clathrin, endocytosis, pHluorin, synaptic vesicle Received 25 May 2010, revised and accepted for pub-lication 8 July 2010, uncorrected manuscript publishe...|$|R
40|$|Shewanella halifaxensis and Shewanella sediminis {{were among}} a few aquatic 3 ̆b 3 -proteobacteria that were psychrophiles {{and the first}} {{anaerobic}} bacteria that degraded hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine (RDX). Although many mesophilic or psychrophilic strains of Shewanella and 3 ̆b 3 -proteobacteria were sequenced for their genomes, the genomic evolution pathways for temperature adaptations were poorly understood. On the other hand, the genes responsible for anaerobic RDX mineralization pathways remain unknown. To determine the unique genomic properties of bacteria responsible for both cold-adaptation and RDX degradation, the genomes of S. halifaxensis and S. sediminis were sequenced and compared with 108 other 3 ̆b 3 -proteobacteria including Shewanella that differ in temperature and Na+ requirements, as well as RDX degradation capability. Results showed that for coping with marine environments their genomes had extensively exchanged with deep sea bacterial genomes. Many genes for Na+-dependent nutrient transporters were recruited to use the high Na+ content as an energy source. For coping with low temperatures, these two strains {{as well as other}} psychrophilic strains of Shewanella and 3 ̆b 3 -proteobacteria were found to decrease their genome G+C content and proteome alanine, proline and arginine content (p-value < 0. 01) to increase protein structural flexibility. Compared to poorer RDX-degrading strains, S. halifaxensis and S. sediminis have more number of genes for cytochromes and other enzymes related to RDX metabolic pathways. Experimentally, one cytochrome was found induced in S. halifaxensis by RDX when the chemical was the sole <b>terminal</b> electron <b>adaptor.</b> The isolated protein degraded RDX by mono-denitration and was identified as a multiheme 53 kDa cytochrome using a proteomic approach. The present analyses provided the first insight into divergent genomic evolution of bacterial strains for adaptation to the specific cold marine conditions and to the degradation of the pollutant RDX. The present study also provided the first evidence of the involvement of a specific c-type cytochrome in anaerobic RDX metabolism. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
