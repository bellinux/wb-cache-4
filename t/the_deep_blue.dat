5|$|The album's artwork {{was created}} by Kamikene and Daisuke Ishizaka of Hatos.

The bright blue was chosen as it was a synthetic ink that regularly occurs in Japanese printing, while <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> <b>blue</b> was taken naturally, isolating a color taken from a photo of the sky just before dawn. The center of the artwork features the Kikuuiki typography, as well as a logo of two overlapping circles. The mix of natural and artificial blue circles was used to represent Kikuuikis theme of mixing points.|$|E
5|$|The {{computer}} console {{explosion that}} causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using brillo pads. Weldon hid steel wool inside the console and attached an arc welder to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire. The welder was designed to create a spark instead of actually welding, causing the steel wool to burn and make sparks; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually startled by the flare-ups, resulting in additional takes. Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti-gravity throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants. The crew built a circular track that had the same shape as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on four small wires that connected to the track. The wires were treated with a special acid which oxidized the metal; the reaction tarnished the wires to a dull gray that would not show up in <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> <b>blue</b> corridor lighting. Cargo boxes were made out of light balsa wood so that fine wires {{could be used as}} support.|$|E

Another disadvantage was that a current had to be continually drawn to keep the two solutions from mixing by diffusion, so it was unsuitable for intermittent use.|$|E
