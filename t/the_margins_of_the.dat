5|$|The {{demographic}} {{growth that}} occurred in Sélestat after 1945 was primarily due to a relatively high birth rate (20.1‰ in Sélestat over the period 1968–1975, compared to 16.9‰ in France). After 1975, this rate progressively declined to match the national figure. Net migration figures remained slightly negative until 1990 because Sélestat and Central Alsace were on <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metropolitan areas of Strasbourg and Colmar and lacked attractivity. Since 1990, the Strasbourg area greatly expanded to gradually reach Sélestat. The town has thus become more attractive to newcomers.|$|E
5|$|The thorax {{is divided}} into two groups of somites. The {{anterior}} group is composed of four somites, each with well-developed walking limbs with lengths that extend past <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carapace. Their morphological details are not well preserved but their distal segments appear to possess a multitude of small spines. It is unknown if these limbs are biramous, but they are assumed to be the endopodites, the inner branches (ramus) of the leg, with the exopodites, or outer branches, absent or not preserved.|$|E
5|$|This {{episode is}} the forty-ninth from the fifth season of Adventure Time.

Small polygonal creatures appear in <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer frame. Film and television critic Eric Kohn, in IndieWire, dubbed the inner frame a time bubble, absorbing the creatures Bubblegum experiments on with the time travel device. Following Lumpy having her memory erased in the episode, Johnnie appears in the outer frame.|$|E

5|$|Utah {{and western}} Colorado were {{deformed}} as {{the rate of}} subduction off the west coast increased in the Middle Jurassic Sevier Orogeny. At the same time, an inland sea began to encroach on the continent from the north. Broad tidal flats and streams carrying iron oxide-rich mud formed on <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shallow sea to the west, creating the Sinawava member of the Temple Cap Formation. Flat-bedded sandstones, siltstones, and limestones filled depressions left in the underlying eroded strata. Streams eroded the poorly cemented Navajo Sandstone, and water caused the sand to slump.|$|E
5|$|Indraloris {{is known}} only from {{isolated}} teeth and {{fragments of the}} mandible. These show that Indraloris was a medium-sized sivaladapid, somewhat smaller than Sivaladapis. In 1982, Gingerich and colleagues estimated that Indraloris himalayensis may have weighed 3.7 to 4.3kg (8.2 to 9.5lb) {{on the basis of}} allometric scaling of tooth size; Flynn and Morgan estimated a body size of about 2kg (4.4lb) for I.kamlialensis. In general, the cingula (shelves) on <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cheekteeth are weak in Indraloris. Among the two named species, I.kamlialensis is about 20% smaller than I.himalayensis. The unnamed large Indraloris is similar in size to I.himalayensis.|$|E
5|$|The proto-Scotland landmass moved northwards, {{and from}} 460–430 Ma, sandstone, {{mudstone}} and limestone were {{deposited in the}} area that is now the Midland Valley. This occurred in shallow tropical seas at <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iapetus Ocean. The Ballantrae Complex near Girvan was formed from this ocean floor and is similar in composition to rocks found at The Lizard in Cornwall. Nonetheless, northern and southern Britain were far apart {{at the beginning of this}} period, although the gap began to close as the continent of Avalonia broke away from Gondwana, collided with Baltica and drifted towards Laurentia. The Caledonian orogeny began forming a mountain chain from Norway to the Appalachians. There was an ice age in the southern hemisphere, and the first mass extinction of life on Earth took place at the end of this period.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{life was}} {{depicted}} {{in a series}} of contemporary illustrations sketched and water-coloured by the chronicler Matthew Paris, mostly drawn in <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chronica majora. Paris first met Henry in 1236 and enjoyed an extended relationship with the King, although Paris disliked many of Henry's actions and the illustrations are frequently unflattering. Henry was also shown in the poetry of his Italian contemporary Dante, who depicted Henry in the Divine Comedy {{as an example of a}} negligent ruler, sitting alone in Purgatory to one side of the other failed kings. It is unclear why he is shown separately from his contemporaries; possible explanations include that this is a code by Dante to show that England was not part of the Holy Roman Empire, or that it is a favourable comment on Henry himself, highlighting his unusual piety. Unlike many other medieval kings, Henry did not feature significantly in the works of William Shakespeare, and in the modern period he has not been a prominent subject for films, theatre or television, having only a minimal role in modern popular culture.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Frederick V. Coville called {{attention}} to the threatened state of the plant in an article in Science. While investigating the species for horticultural purposes, he only found two herbarium specimens, those of Baird and Canby. (Coville apparently did not locate Kinn's West Virginia specimen, preserved at the Muhlenberg Herbarium.) Upon examination of the New Bloomfield site in 1918, he discovered the entire colony, except for one patch cut off by cultivation, was connected by roots, and that no seedlings were in evidence anywhere around <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colony. Coville concluded that the plant was self-sterile and reproduced by extending rootstocks. After commercial nurserymen removed a truckload of box huckleberry from the New Bloomfield site in 1918, Coville was particularly anxious to preserve the species, as the New Bloomfield site was the only one then thought extant. (It was protected by the state from 1929, becoming the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.) However, Edgar T. Wherry was able to locate the Delaware colony, thought lost, in 1919, and send specimens for cross-pollination with specimens from the Pennsylvania colony.|$|E
5|$|Material worn from <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land {{eventually}} {{ends up in}} the sea, {{where it}} is subject to attrition as currents flowing parallel to the coast scour out channels and transport material away from its place of origin. Sediment carried to the sea by rivers settles on the seabed causing deltas to form in estuaries. All these materials move back and forth under the influence of waves, tides, and currents. Dredging removes material and deepens channels but may have unexpected effects elsewhere on the coastline. Governments make efforts to prevent flooding through building breakwaters, seawalls, and other defenses against the sea. In Britain, the Thames Barrier protects London from storm surges, while the failure of the dykes and levees around New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina created a humanitarian crisis in the United States. Land reclamation in Hong Kong permitted the construction of Hong Kong International Airport through the leveling and expansion of two smaller islands.|$|E

5|$|Since {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} extinct macaws exist only for the species on Cuba, {{it is impossible to}} determine the species' relationships. It has been suggested that the closest mainland relative of the Cuban macaw is the scarlet macaw (Ara macao), due to the similar distribution of red and blue in their plumage, and the presence of a white patch around the eyes, naked except for lines of small red feathers. Furthermore, the range of the scarlet macaw extends to <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean Sea. The Cuban macaw is distinct due to its lack of a yellow shoulder patch, its all-black beak, and its smaller size. The two also share a species of feather mite, which supports their relationship. James Greenway believed the scarlet macaw and the Cuban macaw formed a superspecies with the other extinct species suggested to have inhabited Jamaica, Hispaniola and Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|The {{book had}} a sacramental rather than {{educational}} purpose. Such a large, lavish Gospel {{would have been}} left on the high altar {{of the church and}} removed only for the reading of the Gospel during Mass, with the reader probably reciting from memory more than reading the text. It is significant that the Chronicles of Ulster state the book was stolen from the sacristy, where the vessels and other accoutrements of the Mass were stored, rather than from the monastic library. Its design seems to take this purpose in mind; that is, the book was produced with appearance taking precedence over practicality. There are numerous uncorrected mistakes in the text. Lines were often completed in a blank space in the line above. The chapter headings that were necessary to make the canon tables usable were not inserted into <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> page. In general, nothing was done to disrupt the look of the page: aesthetics were given priority over utility.|$|E
5|$|The first list {{fragment}} {{is followed}} by the canon tables of Eusebius of Caesarea. These tables, which predate the text of the Vulgate, were developed to cross-reference the Gospels. Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created tables that allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels. The canon tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most mediaeval copies of the Vulgate text of the Gospels. The tables in the Book of Kells, however, are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the tables {{in such a way as}} to make them confused. In addition, the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text, making it impossible to find the sections to which the canon tables refer. The reason for the omission remains unclear: the scribe may have planned to add the references upon the manuscript's completion, or he may have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages.|$|E

5|$|The molars are high-crowned (hypsodont) and planar, {{with the}} main cusps {{as high as the}} crests {{connecting}} them, a configuration shared only with Holochilus and Carletonomys among oryzomyines. The first molars are the longest and the third molars are longer but narrower than the second molars. The molars lack many accessory ridges, including the anteroloph on the first upper molar, the posteroloph on the first and second upper molar, and the anterolophid and mesolophid on all lower molars. The first and second upper molar have a short mesoloph and the front cusp of the first lower molar, the anteroconid, encloses a large internal pit. Most of the folds between the cusps and crests are open at <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molars, but two—the posteroflexid on the lower second molar and the entoflexid on the lower third molar—are closed by a wall, or cingulum, at the inner margin of the tooth. As in most oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side and the lower molars have a single root at the front and back of each molar; in addition, the first upper molar has another labial root and the first lower molar has a small labial and usually also a small lingual root located between the main roots.|$|E
5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} {{has a very}} thick, distinctively wedge-shaped pectoral fin disc one-third wider than long, with broadly curved leading margins, rather angular outer corners, and nearly straight trailing margins. The snout is short with a rounded tip. The eyes are minute and, unlike in other stingrays, do not protrude above the body; the spiracles (paired respiratory openings) follow immediate behind. There is a short but broad curtain of skin between the nostrils, with a weakly fringed rear margin. The mouth is small and gently arched, with deep furrows at the corners and a tiny projection {{at the center of}} the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw. There are anywhere from 0 to 15 forked papillae (nipple-like structures) in a row across the floor of the mouth. There are 2534 upper tooth rows and 2531 lower tooth rows; the teeth of both sexes have single, pointed cusps, but those of adult males are longer and sharper than those of adult females. <b>The</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pelvic fins are nearly straight in front and become rounded at the tips and in back.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys {{is rare in}} Panama. Panamanian Oryzomys {{were first}} {{described}} by Goldman in 1912, who introduced the name Oryzomys gatunensis for a specimen from Gatún in the Canal Zone. In 1918, Goldman kept the animal as a separate species, remarking that it was similar to richmondi, but distinctive in the well-developed ridges along <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interorbital region, the short interparietal bone (part of {{the roof of the}} braincase), and the long nasal bones. In 1937, Bole described another species of Panamanian Oryzomys, Oryzomys azuerensis from Paracoté, Veraguas Province. It is a brown form, lacking the reddish tones of nearby populations, and has a broad skull with a short rostrum (front part) and ridges on the interorbital region like those of gatunensis. Although Goldman recommended to him that gatunensis and azuerensis both be treated as subspecies of couesi, Bole described azuerensis as a species because it did not seem intermediate between the geographically closest forms, gatunensis and couesi, and was separated by a large gap from the nearest known populations of O.couesi in northwestern Costa Rica and southeastern Nicaragua. In a 1966 review of Panamanian mammals, Charles Handley reduced both gatunensis and azuerensis to subspecies of the marsh rice rat (in which O.couesi was included at the time), and when O.couesi was reinstated as a separate species these forms went with it. Specimens from near the type locality of azuerensis differ by about 7% in their Cytb sequences from other O.couesi, which suggests that they may represent a separate species. However, Hanson and colleagues did not reinstate azuerensis as a species, because they could not examine samples of gatunensis.|$|E
