My diaphragm function, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>my</b> throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E

He prefers to employ a 4–3–3 formation, explaining it allows his teams to play entertaining football and makes them hard to beat, and it brought him success when at Tamworth and York. He has stuck with this formation despite charges from some of being tactically stubborn, saying: [...] "I'm not going to change <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>my</b> teams play, the systems.

During state dinners, he ordered the protocol changed so that Pat could be served first. Pat, in turn, felt {{that her husband was}} vulnerable and sought to protect him. Of his critics, she said that [...] "Lincoln had worse critics. He was big enough not to let it bother him. That's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>my</b> husband is." ...|$|E

She went to York Preparatory in New York City for {{junior high and high}} school after her mother researched the school to accommodate Tyler's ADHD. She graduated in 1995 and left to continue her acting career. [...] When asked about the way she spent her youth, Tyler said: [...] "For me, I didn’t get much of a childhood in my teen years because I’ve been working since I was 14. But that also kept me out of trouble. When everybody was doing acid and partying like crazy, I was at work on a movie in Tuscany... having my own fun, of course, but it was a different kind of thing. I have no regrets. I love <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>my</b> life has gone." ...|$|E

Swift performed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] as the concert's penultimate performance. She dressed in a black, knee-length dress and red cowboy boots with a design of a skull and cross bones across it, playing an acoustic guitar. Swift requested for the audience to raise their cell phones in order to simulate a sky filled with stars, when the song reached the lyrics [...] "He said <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>my</b> blue eyes shined / Put those Georgia stars to shame that night / I said that's a lie." [...] She also performed the song when she served as opening act on twenty dates for George Strait's 2007 United States tour, and selected dates for Brad Paisley's Bonfires & Amplifiers Tour in 2007.

500|$|Usher had {{initially}} planned {{to release the}} album entitled All About U, as his third studio album on October 31, 2000. The album was to follow his successful My Way (1997) which to date, has sold over seven million copies. On March 13, 2000, multiple tracks from the album had leaked on to online music store Napster several months prior to its release, including [...] "T.T.P.", [...] "U R the One" [...] and [...] "Pop Ya Collar". Following the event, the album's release was delayed twice, on December 5, 2000 to July 17, 2001. During the taping of MTV Icon Janet Jackson special, Usher explained that {{he returned to the}} studios to record new songs, stating [...] "I didn't want that to be <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>my</b> record was remembered or the way I would present that to my fans [...] It turned out a lot better" [...] while adding that tracks that were available for download on the site {{were not going to be}} included on the new album. With new tracks produced, Usher's publicist announced a new name for the album, under the title 8701, who claims that it is [...] "practically a new album". The origin of its new name was initially unknown, with speculation that it subsides with its US release of August 7, 2001 (8/7/01), though Usher's publicist claimed that this was purely coincidental, and was not the reasoning for the title. Usher hinted that it was derived after something significant to him, and he would disclose it in the upcoming months. Eventually, his spokesperson revealed that the '87' segment of the title refers to the year 1987, when Usher sang in public for the first time at his church in Atlanta, with the '01' referring to the year 2001.|$|E

The campaign was marred by allegations that Householder's staff had improperly tried to obtain Niehaus's withdrawal from the race and that Householder had told Niehaus's supporters to donate money to Schmidt's campaign. In the initial count of the Republican primary vote on March 2, 2004, she led by just 62 votes. A recount was automatically ordered, which reversed the outcome. Schmidt ultimately lost by just 22 votes: 17,076 (49.9%) to Niehaus's 17,098 (50%).
