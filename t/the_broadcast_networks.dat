25|$|The NFL Network's {{coverage}} {{was not the}} first time that NFL games were covered on Thursday or Saturday. Prior to the new contract, ESPN carried a handful of sporadic Thursday night games (usually those displaced from Sunday night) and <b>the</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>networks</b> used to air several national games on Saturday afternoons in mid-to-late December after the college football regular season ended. Incidentally, the only reason the league is even allowed to televise football games on Saturday night stems from a legal loophole: the league's antitrust exemption, the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, was written when the NFL regular season ended in mid-December, and as such, it contains specific language that prohibits televising NFL games in most markets on Friday nights and all day on Saturdays between the second week of September and the second week of December, to protect high school and college football. Since most high school and college seasons have ended by mid-December, other than bowl games, there has been little desire to close this loophole, even though the regular season has expanded well beyond mid-December since the law's passage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The mobile {{broadcasting}} {{services such as}} mobile television (TV) and interactive social TV become more popular in wireless broadcasting networks and attract {{a lot of research}} attention in pervasive computing. However, due to the error-prone nature of wireless broadcast, how to efficiently recover packet loss at mobile devices is a big challenge. To solve this problem, many research efforts suggest adopting another IP-based wireless network to handle packet recovery. In particular, mobile devices are equipped with two interfaces: one for <b>the</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>network</b> and <b>the</b> other for such a recovery network. Mobile devices will continually receive the broadcasting content from <b>the</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>network.</b> When packets are lost in <b>the</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>network,</b> these mobile devices will ask the recovery network for data retransmissions. In this way, <b>the</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>network</b> can incur less computation complexity because it does not need to simultaneously deal with the regular broadcasting and the retransmission jobs. Taking the digital video braodcasting–handheld (DVB-H) system as an example, this chapter introduces three types of data recovery schemes for mobile {{broadcasting services}}. First, the DVB-H system is integrated with a cellular network, where the parity data are transmitted through either the DVB-H channel or the cellular channel for data recovery. Second, a WiMAX network is adopted to support both the request submission sent from the mobile devices and the packet retransmission to these mobile devices. Third, mobile devices will organize a wireless ad hoc network to exchange the lost DVB-H packets to realize data recovery through peer-to-peer communications.
