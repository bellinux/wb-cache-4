5|$|On the Sunday {{closest to}} 11 November, known as Remembrance Sunday, the entire college assembles {{in front of}} St. George to await a {{procession}} of parents, alumni, guests and teachers. Two minutes silence is followed by The Last Post and a reading. Representatives {{of the student body}} (the Senior Chapel Prefect, who is the Head Boy or Girl) and of the Old Malvernian Society <b>then</b> <b>place</b> wreaths at the foot of St. George. A memorial service follows in the chapel for the more than 400 Malvernians who lost their lives in the Great War.|$|E
5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, <b>then</b> <b>place</b> two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Internet and {{international}} telephone service in Ürümqi remained limited {{for nearly a}} year after the riots. As late as November, most of the Internet was still inaccessible to residents and international phone calls were impossible; as late as December, most web content hosted outside the autonomous region remained off-limits to all but a few journalists, and residents had to travel to Dunhuang 14 hours away to access the Internet normally. Within the city, only about 100 local sites, such as banks and regional government websites, could be accessed. Both incoming and outgoing international phone calls were disallowed, so Ürümqi residents could only communicate by calling intermediaries in other cities in China who would <b>then</b> <b>place</b> the international calls. The communications blackout generated controversy even within China: Yu Xiaofeng of Zhejiang University criticised the move, and many Ürümqi locals said it hurt businesses and delayed recovery, whereas David Gosset of the Euro-China forum argued that the government had the right to shut down communications for the sake of social stability; some locals believed that getting away from the Internet even improved their quality of life.|$|E

25|$|One method Nilsson {{used for}} murdering the {{children}} {{was to put}} them into a washtub and <b>then</b> <b>place</b> heavy objects—such as a washboard and coal scuttle—on top of them. She then left the room and returned hours later when the children were dead. The next step in her procedure was to burn their bodies. On occasions when she did not burn them, she dug graves and buried them.|$|E

25|$|Storing {{bulbs and}} root crops: pour {{vermiculite}} around bulbs placed in container. If clumps are dug, allow to dry {{for a few}} hours in the sun and <b>then</b> <b>place</b> in cartons or bushel baskets and cover with vermiculite. The absorptive power of vermiculite acts as a regulator that prevents mildew and moisture fluctuation during the storage period. It will not absorb moisture from the inside of stored tubers, but it does take up free water from the outside, preventing storage rot.|$|E
25|$|The {{finished}} vault panels, door, {{and lock}} assembly are {{transported to the}} bank construction site. The vault manufacturer's workers <b>then</b> <b>place</b> the panels enclosed in steel at the designated spots and weld them together. The vault manufacturer may also supply an alarm system, which is installed at the same time. While older vaults employed various weapons against burglars, such as blasts of steam or tear gas, modern vaults instead use technological countermeasures. They can be wired with a listening device that picks up unusual sounds, or observed with a camera. An alarm is often present to alert local police if the door or lock is tampered with.|$|E
25|$|When {{visual cues}} in an {{environment}} such as visibility of a line where the wall meets the floor, height of the wall, and width of the wall are available to the rat to discern distance and location of the wall, the rat internalizes this external information to register its surroundings. However, when these visual cues are unavailable, the rat registers wall location by colliding with the wall and <b>then</b> <b>place</b> cell firing rate after the collision provides information to the rat about its distance from the wall based on the direction and speed of its movements after the collision. In this situation, the firing of place cells is due to motor inputs.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch Mine Kafon project, led by {{designer}} Massoud Hassani {{is working}} on a drone system that can quickly detect and clear land mines. The unmanned airborne de-mining system called Mine Kafon Drone uses a three step process to autonomously map, detect and detonate land mines. It flies above potentially dangerous areas, generating a 3D map, and uses a metal detector to pinpoint the location of mines. The drone can <b>then</b> <b>place</b> a detonator above the mines using its robotic gripping arm, before retreating to a safe distance. The firm claims its drone is safer, 20 times faster and up to 200 times cheaper than current technologies and might clear mines globally in 10 years. The project raised funds on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter with their goal set at €70,000 and receiving over €100,000 above it.|$|E
25|$|Hook, remembers {{about the}} last time he saw his father, when Gold arrives to confront him but Hook is steadfast in {{carrying}} out his plan. Meanwhile, Emma is determined to stop Hook and everyone follows her and tell the others to split up. Regina and Robin then run into Zelena, who vows to get custody of her daughter, only to be confronted by a group of Dark Ones who <b>then</b> <b>place</b> a mark on Emma's family and friends in a similar fashion. Gold explains to Emma that it is the Mark of Charon, who navigates the ferry to the Underworld. The Dark Ones plan to sacrifice the souls of the marked living, who will replace them in Hell. Then, the 21 resurrected Dark Ones march through Storybrooke, led by Nimue, to prepare for their final battle.|$|E
25|$|A {{variant of}} this is to use two {{capacitors}} in series for the output smoothing on a bridge rectifier <b>then</b> <b>place</b> a switch between the midpoint of those capacitors and one of the AC input terminals. With the switch open, this circuit acts like a normal bridge rectifier. With the switch closed, it act like a voltage doubling rectifier. In other words, this makes it easy to derive a voltage of roughly 320V (±15%, approx.) DC from any 120V or 230V mains supply in the world, this can then be fed into a relatively simple switched-mode power supply. However, for a given desired ripple, the value of both capacitors must be twice the value of the single one required for a normal bridge rectifier; when the switch is closed each one must filter the output of a half-wave rectifier, and when the switch is open the two capacitors are connected in series with an equivalent value of half one of them.|$|E

25|$|Similar to Manobo, Badjao tribe {{also carries}} out {{religious}} process to burying the dead. First, {{the body of}} dead will be positioned {{in the center of}} Umboh (floating hut) where it is laid parallel to the side wall. The preparation until the burial itself happens during the wake; first, food as homage will be brought, and the Song of the Dead will be sung. Second, the corpse-wrapping bandages are cut and washed in water while Imam (religious man) cleanses the body. Third, the dead will be dressed and decorated, which will later position itself lying on the floor. Next, Imam finally prays for the dead before the bandage completely covers the corpse. Then batik (a decoration) will be spread all over the cocoon. After finishing this ceremony within a day, Imam finally prays at the four corners of the buried site, <b>then</b> <b>place</b> Sundok (oblong stone that is believed to contain the spirit) near the head of the dead).|$|E
25|$|More recently, another {{starting}} position choice has been allowed, {{known as the}} optional offensive {{starting position}} or optional start. After the wrestler with the choice (the offensive wrestler) indicates his intention to the referee, the referee lets the defensive wrestler adjust and begin in the defensive starting position. Next, the offensive wrestler goes {{to either side of}} the defensive wrestler or behind him, with all his weight supported by both his feet or by one or both knees. The offensive wrestler would <b>then</b> <b>place</b> both his hands on the opponent's back between the neck and the waist. When the referee starts the match by blowing the whistle, the defensive wrestler then has the opportunity to get back to his feet in a neutral position. Any of the starting positions may be used to resume action during a period when the wrestlers go off the mat, depending on the referee's judgment as to whether any or which wrestler had the position of advantage.|$|E
25|$|The NES {{version of}} Mario's Time Machine has a heavier {{emphasis}} on platforming {{than the other}} two versions. Despite the presence of enemies, Mario cannot lose lives or even take damage, so obtaining a game over is impossible. To obtain an artifact in Bowser's museum, the player plays a Mario Bros.-inspired minigame in which he fights Koopa Troopas. The player can then use the Timulator and travel to one of the fourteen selectable time periods. Unlike the other versions, the player is not explicitly told which time period the artifact originated from. The player is instead encouraged to explore the time periods and obtain hints, either from local denizens or from message blocks. Once the player figures out the artifact that belongs in that time period, he can <b>then</b> <b>place</b> the artifact in its original spot. After all the artifacts have been returned, the player is tasked to answer three random multiple choice questions pertaining to the historical periods visited. Answering the questions correctly will lead the player to the final boss fight with Bowser. The player wins the game upon Bowser's defeat.|$|E

25|$|The Kelb tal-Fenek {{is usually}} taken out to hunt {{at night when}} there are fewer distractions. Generally, the hunters will take their dogs into the {{countryside}} and release pairs of a male and a female dog in each compass direction. The dogs will then search out their prey using scent. When a rabbit is found the hounds will give chase, the small and more agile female in the lead with the male keeping the rabbit from darting {{too far to the}} sides. At this point the dogs giving chase will emit a high pitched bark, attracting the other dogs and the hunters, all of whom will come running. By the time the hunters and other dogs arrive the rabbit will almost always have taken to the ground. The hunters will then gather and leash all but one dog, <b>then</b> <b>place</b> nets over all of the likely escape holes of the rabbit. Finally the hunter will take a ferret (with a small bell attached) from a round wicker basket, and places it into the last entrance to the rabbit's burrow. The Kelb tal-Fenek can hear the little bell up to 3 meters down under the rocky terrain. When the ferret flushes the rabbit out a hole, one free dog swoops down upon it. This style of hunting is mentioned by Strabo about hunting in the Balearic Islands under Roman rule, and the Maltese word for ferret—"nemes"—may have its roots in the Greek word ''.|$|E
500|$|The red coat {{remained}} standard uniform for the British Army until khaki {{was introduced}} as standard in 1885, although some allowances {{were made for}} colonial conditions, {{with the use of}} lighter materials, and slight change of design. However, the uniform and equipment remained quite restrictive, particularly in colonial warfare. In 1841, the light bobs situation was compared unfavourably with his enemy's light marching order: [...] "Buckle him up in a tight red jacket, when the thermometer is about 80°; place across his breast two buff-leather belts, about a quarter of an inch in thickness, and each what the milliners call a nail in breadth; hang to one of them a cartouche-box containing sixty rounds of ball cartridges, each of these about above an ounce in weight; strap across his shoulders a square well-packed wallet, containing four shirts, with or without frills, and other notions; plant a cap on his head which in point of weight is equal to an iron pot; <b>then</b> <b>place</b> over his shoulder a musket and bayonet weighing a stone; with three days' provisions in his haversack, and a couple of quarts of liquid in a canteen." ...|$|E
