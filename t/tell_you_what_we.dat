500|$|Australia {{finished}} the Games with two bronze medals. Jason Hellwig {{stated that the}} aim was to win between two and five medals. He said: [...] "wo medals absolutely is a pass ... so we're really pleased with that but we're absolutely disappointed we didn't get the mission done to win that gold medal, but I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what,</b> <b>we</b> are absolutely determined to get it done in four years' time. It hasn't been easy, we've come in under the most difficult of circumstances that I've ever seen a team [...] at a major Games." [...] Chris Nunn, Chef de Mission, pointed to the future by stating that [...] "We really need to focus on having good-quality athletes who are robust and have financial support to get overseas. It's not like living in Austria, Sweden or Germany where you can do this on the weekend and after work." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the initial}} {{announcement}} of its revival, {{the race was}} subject to criticism in light of Azerbaijan's human rights record as the race was established with the financial support of the Azerbaijani government. On 7 June 2016, the organisation Sport for Rights called for Bernie Ecclestone to speak out about the human rights situation in the country, having written {{an open letter to}} him to which Ecclestone had not replied. Sport for Rights {{made it clear that they}} did not call for a cancellation of the race, but instead urged the sport to use the race to promote these issues in public. Ecclestone replied a week later, saying that Formula One had [...] "a clear conscience" [...] on human rights and added: [...] "I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> ought to do. As far as we are concerned, not have any races where there is corruption in the country. Can you tell me where we are going to be racing?" ...|$|E

5000|$|There {{is almost}} {{no sign of}} the {{opposition}} campaigning in the constituency.
