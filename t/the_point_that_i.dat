500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was {{directed}} by Ray Kay and filmed inside a basement in Los Angeles, California. On March 17, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account, [...] "Day 1 of the #TTWE Videoshoot. Just wrapped my first big dance number. Taking a well deserved break people!" [...] She also tweeted {{a picture of her}} on set, wearing ripped tights, a Burberry Prorsum studded leather jacket and matching fingerless leather gloves. The making-of was chronicled on the special Britney Spears: I Am the Femme Fatale, which aired on MTV on April 3, 2011, at 21:00 EST (02:00 UTC). In the special, Spears is seen watching the playback, as she later explained, [...] " [...] just to make sure it's right and that the costume looks right and the dancers are together and we all look in unison. It's an energy and it looks fresh. It has a certain vibe with it and it makes sense." [...] She also went on to describe the set as [...] "grimy and gross [...] It was sweat and it was disgusting sometimes". At a point in the shoot, Spears changed her heels to Ugg boots during the shots that did not show her feet, stating that [...] " [...] hurts ... but it looks good. It wasn't a full-length shot, so a girl's about comfort when it's not showing." [...] Spears said that she did not feel the need to top herself, saying that [...] "I've made so many videos that I'm at <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> genuinely want to enjoy myself, and I have such a good team of people with me. [...] I had never worked with Ray Kay before. I was really happy with the work we did." [...] The video was choreographed by Brian Friedman. On April 4, 2011, it was announced that two different versions of the music video would be released, a director's cut and a choreography cut. The same day, Spears tweeted a 30-second preview of the video, announcing, [...] "#TillTheWorldEnds video premieres THIS Wednesday on VEVO. Cant wait to share it with you guys!" [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] became at the Spears second VEVOcertified music video on YouTube.|$|E

The group primarily performed at friend's parties and bonfires, and once played Oasis, the local music venue. Hoppus left Ridgecrest in summer 1992 to attend college {{and get a job}} at a local music store in San Diego. Hoppus continued playing gigs with of All Things, returning on weekends. Eventually, Hoppus' manager became suspicious of his weekend activities (Hoppus having told him he worked with mentally disabled children in Ridgecrest) and refused any time off on weekends. His [...] "short lived attempt" [...] at college, studying at California State University, San Marcos, revolved around plans to become an English teacher. He recalls he [...] "hated" [...] college and his reasoning behind becoming a teacher involved sights set for educational reform. He dropped out in the early 1990s after [...] "things began to take off with Blink-182" [...] and lived with his mother for many of {{the early years of the}} band. Hoppus describes his mother as always supportive in his decisions to drop out of college and tour with Blink-182; however, he describes his father as [...] "more realistic, [...] he said, 'Have something to fall back on.'" [...] "I'm really fortunate that my mom always completely supported me, even to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> dropped out of college and lived at her house for five years before our band started to catch on," [...] said Hoppus.|$|E

6000|$|We {{have seen}} how impressively impersonal the Far East is. Now if {{individuality}} be the natural measure of the height of civilization which a nation has reached, impersonality should betoken a relatively laggard position in the race. We ought, therefore, to find among these people certain other characteristics corroborative of a less advanced state of development. In the first place, if imagination be the impulse of which increase in individuality is the resulting motion, that quality should be at a minimum there. The Far Orientals {{ought to be a}} particularly unimaginative set of people. Such is precisely what they are. Their lack of imagination is a well-recognized fact. All who have been brought in contact with them have observed it, merchants as strikingly as students. Indeed, the slightest intercourse with them could not fail to make it evident. Their matter-of-fact way of looking at things is truly distressing, coming as it does from so artistic a people. One notices it all the more for the shock. To get a prosaic answer from a man whose appearance and surroundings betoken better things is not calculated to dull that answer's effect.

It was my brother that did it, though {{everyone}} {{knew that it was}} under the influence of Sparrow MacCoy. I bought up that cheque, and a pretty sum it cost me. Then I went to my brother, laid it before him on the table, and swore to him that I would prosecute if he did not clear out of the country. At first he simply laughed. I could not prosecute, he said, without breaking our mother's heart, and he knew that I would not do that. I made him understand, however, that our mother's heart was being broken in any case, and that I had set firm on <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would rather see him in Rochester gaol than in a New York hotel. So at last he gave in, and he made me a solemn promise that he would see Sparrow MacCoy no more, that he would go to Europe, and that he would turn his hand to any honest trade that I helped him to get. I took him down right away to an old family friend, Joe Willson, who is an exporter of American watches and clocks, and I got him to give Edward an agency in London, with a small salary and a 15 per cent commission on all business. His manner and appearance were so good that he won the old man over at once, and within a week he was sent off to London with a case full of samples.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is found}} that the {{productive}} power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further; by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts, so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations. And thus, in time, arise those remarkable cases {{of what is called}} the division of labor, with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar. Adam Smith’s illustration from pin-making, though so well known, is so much to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will venture once more to transcribe it: “The business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations. One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on, is a peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper.... I have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed, and where some of them, consequently, performed two or three distinct operations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upward of forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day.” ...|$|E

London is one of the safest cities in the world in an urban area of 10 million. ... One of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted to explore was that we don’t understand crime or murder.

6000|$|My first {{question}} is this. There are alternative courses open to us. We can either withdraw our reforms, or we can persevere in them. Which would be the more flagrant sign of weakness--to go steadily on with your policy of reform in spite of bombs, or to let yourself openly be forced by bombs and murder clubs to drop your policy? My second question is--Who would be best pleased if I were to announce to your Lordships that the Government have determined to drop the reforms? Why, it is notorious that those who would be best pleased would be the extremists and irreconcilables, just because they know well that {{for us to do}} anything to soften estrangement, and appease alienation between the European and native populations, would be the very best way that could be adopted to deprive them of fuel for their sinister and mischievous designs. I hope your Lordships will agree in that, and I should like to add one reason which I am sure will weigh very much with you. I do not know whether your Lordships have read the speech made last Friday by Sir Norman Baker, the new Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, in the Council at Calcutta, dealing with <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am endeavouring to present. In a speech of great power and force, he said that these repressive measures did not represent even the major part of the true policy dealing with the situation. The greater task, he said, was to adjust the machinery of government, so that their Indian fellow-subjects might be allotted parts which a self-respecting people could fill, and that when the constitutional reforms were announced, as they would be shortly, he believed that the task of restoring order would be on the road to accomplishment. For a man holding such a position to make such a statement at that moment, is all the corroboration that we need for persisting in our policy of reform. I have talked with Indian experts of all kinds concerning reforms. I admit that some have shaken their heads; they did not like reforms very warmly. But when I have asked, [...] "Shall we stand still, then?" [...] there is not one of those experienced men who has not said, [...] "That is quite impossible. Whatever else we do, we cannot stand still." ...|$|E

Real hired guns are, by definition, persons willing to do violence to the law, or at least to do violence. A willingness to do violence or to break the law is not, however, characteristic of lawyers. On the contrary, lawyers almost uniformly see their role as seeking to obtain their clients 2 ̆ 7 goals within the boundaries set by the law, and lawyers certainly do not typically see themselves as open to doing violent acts...|$|R
