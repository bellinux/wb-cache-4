Smith, {{who plays}} the {{formidable}} and disdainful Dowager Countess, has a lovely way of delivering words, always spaced to perfection. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be a treat if you like a lavish period drama of a Sunday evening.|$|E
25|$|I'm just shocked. It's unbelievable. I {{feel like}} my dream has come true, the dream I've been dreaming since a little girl has come true. There were points I thought, 'You know what, I don't know if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to happen'. But with the help from my friends and my family, they all kept telling me to believe in myself and keep on doing it and I did and now I'm here and {{thank you so much}} to them.|$|E
25|$|It {{is up to}} Elbryan and Pony, {{with help}} from their friends {{such as the new}} {{character}} Roger Lockless, to attempt a rescue while fighting the enemy. During this time Elbryan teaches Pony Bi'nelle dasada, the forbidden sword-dance of the Touel'alfar, the short winged elves of Corona. Meanwhile, Father Abbot Markwart schemes to get back the stolen gemstones from Jilseponie. One of his servants, Marcalo De'Unnero, uses his exceptional training in the martial arts to create two new Brothers Justice to find the woman and the gemstones and deal with them both.

500|$|Laws {{should be}} [...] "prospective, open and clear". The {{meaning of the}} law should not be [...] "ambiguous, vague, obscure or imprecise", and the law must be {{sufficiently}} publicized. Furthermore, laws should generally not be retroactive; but if a retroactive law is to be enacted, the fact that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be done must be known for certain {{to ensure that the}} retroactivity does not clash with the rule of law.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Russell T Davies {{has said}} that he hopes to defy {{audience}} expectations of monosexual characters: [...] "Without making it political or dull, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be a very bisexual programme. I want to knock down the barriers so we can't define which of the characters is gay. We need to start mixing things up, rather than thinking, 'This is a gay character and he'll only ever go off with men.'" ...|$|E

They decided to quit when they realized [...] "this can lead to only death or something, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> too far."

500|$|Prior to the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, Moran told an anti-war audience in Reston, Virginia, that if [...] "it {{were not for}} the strong support of the Jewish community for this war with Iraq, we would not be doing this. The leaders of the Jewish community are influential enough that they could change the direction of where <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going,</b> and I think they should". This brought criticism from many of his own party, including, among others, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle and Senator Joe Lieberman. Nancy Pelosi, who was House Minority Leader at the time, remarked that [...] "Moran's comments have no place in the Democratic Party." ...|$|E

That whole first week I was there we worked on the 'Woods' song, which is called 'Lost in the World'. We were just eating breakfast and listening to the song on the speakers and he's like, 'Fuck, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be the festival closer.' I was like, 'Yeah, cool.'

Take {{it all the way}} back. I think <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be the thing everyone talks about {{for the rest of their}} lives, and it will live on in infamy and history.

500|$|After Neighbours, Dale {{struggled}} to find work in Australia because he was typecast as Jim Robinson. His only regular sources of income were voice-overs, and publishing magazines about his former show which he [...] "made {{quite a lot of}} money out of". He lost most of his profits investing in a failed children's magazine. In 1999, he was cast in the American TV film First Daughter, which was filmed in Australia. After discovering he could perform a convincing American accent, Dale attended the film's premiere, finally moving with his family to the United States permanently in January 2000. Dale, his second wife Tracey, and their then two-year-old son Nick moved into an [...] "awful little flat" [...] in Los Angeles and found an agent.

Brilliant introduced Burns to another specialist, W. Ian Lipkin. With the aid of these physicians, the producers were able to obtain additional perspectives from representatives of the World Health Organization. Burns also met with the author of [...] The Coming Plague, Laurie Garrett. Her 1995 book helped Burns consider a variety of potential plots for the film. He wanted to feature an official from the CDC, and ultimately decided to use an epidemiologist, since that role requires interacting with people while tracking the disease.|$|E
500|$|Localised strike action {{began in}} June 2009 when workers at Royal Mail offices in London and Edinburgh staged a 24-hour strike on 19 June over {{concerns}} about the impact that modernisation would have on postal workers. This was followed the next day by a similar walkout in parts of Scotland. Speaking about the situation at the time Dave Ward, the CWU's deputy general secretary said, [...] "We are now seeing cuts but not modernisation in the postal industry and there's only so long before <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> {{have a major impact}} on services. The CWU does not and has not blocked change. Once again we are seeing Royal Mail working against the union and failing to engage the workforce." [...] Ward also said that his union would offer Royal Mail and the government a three-month no-strike deal if Royal Mail fulfilled its part of the 2007 agreement.|$|E

500|$|During oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts {{noted that}} the case was a [...] "very {{familiar}} situation of an apprentice who is both an employee and a student," [...] {{and that the only}} way that one could draw a line between the two [...] "is to have somebody say: <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be the line." [...] He was of the opinion that if anyone should draw the line, the Internal Revenue Service should be the one. Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, on the other hand, felt that residents were employees, as evidenced by her statement [...] "You don't think receiving $50,000 or $60,000 a year is enough to make you an employee of someone?" [...] According to The Wall Street Journal, Associate Justice Samuel Alito appeared to be more favorable to the medical schools, asking the Justice Department's lawyer at one point [...] "in general, why do medical students become residents? Are they enrolled in the program to make money...or do they want additional education?" ...|$|E
500|$|Frank {{was criticized}} by {{conservative}} organizations for campaign contributions totaling $42,350 between 1989 and 2008. Bill Sammon, the Washington {{managing editor for}} Fox News Channel, claimed the donations from Fannie and Freddie influenced his support of their lending programs, and said that Frank did not play a strong enough role in reforming the institutions in the {{years leading up to}} the economic crisis of 2008. In 2006, a Fannie Mae representative stated in SEC filings that they [...] "did not participate in large amounts of these non-traditional mortgages in 2004 and 2005." [...] In response to criticism, Frank said, [...] "In 2004, it was Bush who started to push Fannie and Freddie into subprime mortgages, because they were boasting about how they were expanding homeownership for low-income people. And I said at the time, 'Hey—(a) <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to jeopardize their profitability, but (b) it's going to put people in homes they can't afford, and they're gonna lose them.'" ...|$|E
