5|$|Leo had {{meanwhile}} united the Armenian Church in Cilicia with Rome {{and acknowledged}} the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry VI. The emperor's envoy, Conrad of Wittelsbach, Archbishop of Mainz, was present when Leo was crowned the first king of Armenian Cilicia on 6January 1198. Before long, Conrad went to Antioch and persuaded Bohemond and his barons <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> to accept Raymund-Roupen's right to inherit Antioch.|$|E
5|$|Not all Texans favored secession initially, {{although}} many of the same would later support the Southern cause. Texas's most notable Unionist was the state Governor, Sam Houston. Not wanting to aggravate the situation, Houston refused two offers from President Lincoln for Union troops to keep him in office. After refusing <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> of allegiance to the Confederacy, Houston was deposed as governor.|$|E

5|$|In {{the middle}} of this confrontation, Henry {{unexpectedly}} fell ill and died near Lyons-la-Forêt. It is uncertain what, if anything, Henry said about the succession before his death. Contemporary chronicler accounts were coloured by subsequent events. Sources favourable to Matilda suggested that Henry had reaffirmed his intent to grant all his lands to his daughter, while hostile chroniclers argued that Henry had renounced his former plans and had apologised for having forced the barons <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> of allegiance to her.|$|E

Before disappearing, the Shehri brothers went to Al-Seqley Mosque <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> and commitment to jihad, as did Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi. Wail presided over the ceremony, dubbing himself Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi after one of Muhammad's companions.|$|E

He repeated the same oath to his Cortes (assembly of estates) in 1510, and throughout his life he was unwilling to break it.

5|$|On 20 August 1934, civil {{servants}} were required <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> of unconditional obedience to Hitler; a similar oath had been required {{of members of}} the military several weeks prior. This law became the basis of the Führerprinzip, the concept that Hitler's word overrode all existing laws. Any acts that were sanctioned by Hitler—even murder—thus became legal. All legislation proposed by cabinet ministers had to be approved by the office of Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess, who also had a veto over top civil service appointments.|$|E
5|$|During the Reconstruction Era, Confederate {{veterans}} {{were initially}} prohibited from holding public office or from practicing law in West Virginia {{without taking a}} test oath. The West Virginia House of Delegates passed a bill in 1868 that allowed Monroe to practice law without having <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath.</b> Following the passage of this bill, he resumed {{the practice of law}} in Romney. In 1872, he represented Hampshire County at the West Virginia Constitutional Convention in Charleston. In 1875, Monroe returned to politics when he was elected as a Democrat to represent Hampshire County in the West Virginia House of Delegates for one two-year term. It was during this legislative session that Monroe served as Speaker of the West Virginia House of Delegates. He was the first delegate to represent Hampshire County in both the Virginia General Assembly and the West Virginia Legislature.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, oaths {{were taken}} very seriously. As King, James was Head of the Church of Scotland or Kirk, sworn by his Coronation Oath to {{preserve}} its position and privileges. The Test Act required government officials and MPs <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>an</b> <b>Oath</b> of Allegiance to the Protestant religion and the monarch, regardless of personal religion. James thus received their support despite his own Catholicism but promised not to diminish {{the primacy of the}} Church of Scotland. Removing these restrictions was seen as contrary to that commitment. Many MPs were also members of the Episcopalian minority imposed on the Kirk in 1661; Argyll's defeat showed the weakening of Presbyterian influence but voting for these measures would undo that. James' credibility was seriously damaged, since he appeared willing to ignore his previous commitments, his Coronation Oath and his most loyal supporters.|$|E

50|$|Congress {{originally}} {{devised the}} oath in July 1862 for all federal employees, lawyers and federal elected officials. It {{was applied to}} Southern voters in the Wade-Davis Bill of 1864, which President Abraham Lincoln vetoed. Former vice-president Andrew Johnson also opposed it after he became president in April 1865. Both Johnson and Lincoln wanted Southerners instead <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> {{that in the future}} they would support the Union. Lincoln's amnesty oath was integral to his ten percent plan for reconstruction. In 1864 Congress extended the provisions of the ironclad oath to its own members, but overlooked perjury when it came to seating Southern Republicans.|$|R
5|$|The House of Commons {{backed the}} {{proposals}} strongly, but {{the bill of}} supremacy met opposition in the House of Lords, particularly from the bishops. Elizabeth was fortunate that many bishoprics were vacant at the time, including the Archbishopric of Canterbury. This enabled supporters amongst peers to outvote the bishops and conservative peers. Nevertheless, Elizabeth was forced to accept the title of Supreme Governor of the Church of England rather than the more contentious title of Supreme Head, which many thought unacceptable {{for a woman to}} bear. The new Act of Supremacy became law on 8 May 1559. All public officials were <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> of loyalty to the monarch as the supreme governor or risk disqualification from office; the heresy laws were repealed, to avoid a repeat of the persecution of dissenters practised by Mary. At the same time, a new Act of Uniformity was passed, which made attendance at church and the use of an adapted version of the 1552 Book of Common Prayer compulsory, though the penalties for recusancy, or failure to attend and conform, were not extreme.|$|E
5|$|According to John of Salisbury, {{who first}} {{reported}} {{this story in}} 1172 {{after the death of}} Thomas Becket, as a young clerk Roger was involved in a scandal involving a homosexual relationship with a boy named Walter. After Walter made the relationship public, Roger reacted by embroiling Walter in judicial case that ended with Walter's eyes being gouged out. When Walter then accused Roger of this crime, Roger persuaded a judge to condemn Walter to death by hanging. Becket supposedly was involved in the cover-up afterwards, by arranging with Hilary of Chichester and John of Coutances for Roger <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> that he was innocent. According to John of Salisbury, Roger then went to Rome in 1152 and was cleared of involvement by Pope Eugene III. John of Salisbury further alleges that it was only after bribery that the pope cleared Roger. Frank Barlow, a medieval historian and Becket's biographer, points out in his biography of Becket that while Roger was accused of these crimes, and may even have been guilty of some sort of criminal homosexuality, John of Salisbury's motives for bringing up this story in 1172 were almost certainly to defame Roger. Such a story would naturally have put Roger in the worst possible light.|$|E
5|$|The head of {{the legal}} system was officially the pharaoh, who was {{responsible}} for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at. Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.|$|E

5|$|On 30 November, the 4th Regiment was disbanded, its 1st Battalion {{assigned}} to the 1st Regiment {{and the rest of}} its manpower {{assigned to}} the 2nd Regiment. On 1 December 1942, the Corps was incorporated into the Wehrmacht and all its members were required <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> to German leader Adolf Hitler. The Corps grew in numbers throughout 1942, following an influx of volunteers from Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Greece. By late 1942, the Corps totalled about 7,500 men, all of whom were Russian. During the re-organization, an attempt was made to expand the Corps further by recruiting Soviet POWs, but the first experiment with 300 POWs proved unsuccessful and was not repeated. On 9 December 1942, the 1st Regiment started to be transformed with the arrival of Kuban Cossacks led by Major General Naumenko. By January 1943, it consisted entirely of Cossacks. On 17 March 1943, Major General Gontarev replaced Shapilov as commander of the 3rd Regiment. The 1st Regiment fought in Loznica in April and participated in a large operation in Zapolje just south of Krupanj over the border with the NDH on 11–15 May, where it engaged in heavy combat with Partisan forces. From 1–8 July, the regiment was again stationed in Loznica and Ljubovija, participating in the defence of the Drina Bridge at Zvornik against the Partisans. During this time the regiment allowed the passage of 379 wounded Croatian soldiers and civilians, 1,000 healthy soldiers and as many refugees, sustaining casualties of two killed and seventeen wounded. It clashed with the Partisans over the village of Nedelica on 19 July. Meanwhile, the 2nd Regiment clashed with the Partisans around the town of Negotin. The 4th Regiment was re-established on 15 December, and was based in Jagodina, Paraćin and Ćuprija in the centre of the occupied territory.|$|E

[...] When it came <b>to</b> <b>swearing</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> respect the treaty, Sparta swore on behalf of itself and its allies. [...] When Epaminondas came forward, asking <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> {{on behalf of the}} whole Boeotian League, the Spartans refused, saying he could swear as the representative of Thebes or not at all. [...] This Epaminondas refused. [...] (According to Xenophon, the Thebans signed as [...] "the Thebans", and asked the next day to change their signature to [...] "the Boeotians", but the Spartan king, Agesilaus, would not allow it.)

25|$|Oaths—sworn for the {{purposes}} of business, clientage and service, patronage and protection, state office, treaty and loyalty—appealed to the witness and sanction of deities.
