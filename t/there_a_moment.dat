"No, my friend, <b>there</b> was <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{when you}} were not all together. <b>There</b> was <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> when you {{could not have been}} all together, or {{it would not have been}} {{necessary}} to call to Monsieur Lawrence to come and join you on the balcony." ...|$|R
2500|$|Another {{additional}} {{scene with}} Donna [...] {{was cut from}} the final episode: [...] "There was an additional Donna bit after this goodbye from the Doctor, which is when he goes outside into the TARDIS, we cut back into the kitchen, and <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> where Donna hears the TARDIS... <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of realisation, and then she turns back round and carries on talking into the phone." [...] Gardner considered this scene untruthful and too confusing, since Donna remembering would lead to her death, and since she didn't recognise the Doctor it wouldn't make sense to assume she would recognise {{the noise of the}} TARDIS.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Wrapp pushed Lane forward, {{and stood}} <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{in the sudden}} silence, then {{stepping}} back, she went out and closed the door.|$|E
60|$|Now {{she seemed}} to faint and slid from her horse into his arms, and lay <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> while Godwin turned aside his head.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was not my}} fault, Captain Walsham, it wasn't indeed; but I {{should have}} been tomahawked if I had stayed <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> longer." ...|$|E

6000|$|She held me <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> then whisked up {{her apron}} again with her {{detached}} hand. [...] "Would you mind, miss, if I used the freedom--" ...|$|E
6000|$|The skipper stood <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{and then}} he ses: [...] "I wish you’d let me see ’ow my dog looks in your dog’s collar," [...] he ses.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-night all," [...] he ses. Then {{he went to}} {{the front}} door and opened it, and arter {{standing}} <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> came back as though he 'ad forgotten something.|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> was <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> silence. Norgate {{was looking}} a little dazed.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> was <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> silence. Then {{the tall}} man stood upright.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> was <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> silence; the {{stranger}} whistled to his dog.|$|R
6000|$|Lucy did {{not know}} what to do. She walked slowly along to the door, and after {{standing}} <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> while Rollo was at work upon the cabinet, she said, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{not enough}} for Mr. Brand," [...] said Charlotte, simply. And she stood <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> as if waiting conscientiously for {{anything}} more that Felix might have to say.|$|E
6000|$|KEITH {{gives her}} an intent look, then {{crosses to the}} fire. He [...] stands <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> looking down, then turns to the girl, who [...] has crept back to the couch.|$|E

60|$|Here {{he inquired}} for the Princess Emma, {{learning}} with evident relief {{that she was}} <b>there.</b> <b>A</b> <b>moment</b> later, white with dust, his face streamed with sweat, he was ushered into her presence.|$|E
60|$|She stood <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{between the}} two ruffians who {{had been sent to}} fetch her, and her eyes {{travelling}} round that room discovered Rabecque in his undignified and half; strangled condition.|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> was <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> silence. Domiloff was {{staggered}} by her bold words.|$|R
