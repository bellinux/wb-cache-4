25|$|After Griffith's {{death in}} 1955, his nephew and adopted son Calvin {{took over the}} <b>team</b> <b>presidency.</b> Calvin sold Griffith Stadium {{to the city of}} Washington and leased it back leading to {{speculation}} that the team was planning to move as the Boston Braves, St. Louis Browns and Philadelphia Athletics had all done in the early 1950s. By 1957, after an early flirtation with San Francisco (where the New York Giants would eventually move after that season ended), Griffith began courting Minneapolis–St. Paul, a prolonged process that resulted in his rejecting the Twin Cities' first offer before agreeing to relocate. The American League opposed the move at first, but in 1960 a deal was reached: The Senators would move and would be replaced with an expansion Senators team for 1961. Thus, the old Washington Senators became the Minnesota Twins.|$|E

In what proved to be a [...] of things to come, he had to ask for help from former Cleveland Indians owner Bill Daley — who, ironically, had nearly moved the Indians to Seattle earlier in the 1960s. In return, Soriano sold Daley a 47 percent stake in the team, making him the largest shareholder. Soriano, however, retained the <b>team</b> <b>presidency.</b> Largely due to being badly undercapitalized, Soriano was nearly out of money {{by the end of the}} 1969 season.|$|E
50|$|Montgomery, {{along with}} {{co-owner}} Bill Giles, purchased {{the team in}} 1981 for $30,000,000 ($ today); Giles, the primary owner, named Montgomery the {{executive vice president of}} the team. In 1997, when Giles left the <b>team</b> <b>presidency</b> to become the chairman and focus on winning a new stadium for the team, he recommended Montgomery to replace him as team president. In so doing, Montgomery became the first native of Philadelphia to run the club in over 60 years. One of his focuses with the team has been brand development, evidenced by the team's commitment to signing successful players to long-term contracts prior to the opening of Citizens Bank Park in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|After {{yet another}} dismal {{performance}} in , the Mariners managed their first winning season in , finishing 83–79 under manager Jim Lefebvre. Though {{it was the}} team's best season up to that point, it was only good enough for a fifth-place finish in the seven-team American League West in which no team finished under [...]500, and Lefebvre was fired after 1991. The team hired Bill Plummer as Lefebvre's replacement for the [...] season, but he too was let go after a 98-loss campaign in 1992. Much {{of the reason for}} that was trading away pitchers Bill Swift, Mike Jackson and Dave Burba to the San Francisco Giants for outfielder Kevin Mitchell and pitcher Mike Remlinger. Bill Swift would go on to win the ERA title in 1992 and finish 2nd in Cy Young voting in 1993, Mike Jackson would have a solid career as a relief pitcher and Burba would pitch well as both a reliever and starter. While Kevin Mitchell had a solid year in 1992, he would be traded the next season to Cincinnati for Norm Charlton and Mike Remlinger didn't even play in a Mariner uniform. After several years of relocation threats by owner Jeff Smulyan, {{in the middle of the}} 1992 season, the Mariners were purchased by a group of Seattle-area businessmen, led by Nintendo chairman Hiroshi Yamauchi. The purchase was initially opposed by baseball officials, who objected to a team being owned by a non-North American entity. Eventually, they allowed the sale, provided that the <b>team's</b> <b>presidency</b> and chairmanship remained in the hands of American partners.|$|R

50|$|Fuchs was the {{attorney}} for John McGraw's New York Giants when he bought the Boston Braves with Christy Mathewson and James McDonough in 1922. Matthewson was originally intended to be the principal owner. However, Mathewson's precarious health (he'd suffered a severe case of tuberculosis during World War I and never recovered) forced him {{to turn over the}} <b>team</b> <b>presidency</b> to Fuchs after the 1923 season. After Jack Slattery quit as manager, Fuchs hired Rogers Hornsby to manage the rest of the 1928 season. However, Fuchs was already in financial trouble, and was forced to sell Hornsby to the Chicago Cubs after the season. He then took over as his own manager, finishing in last place. The Philadelphia Phillies loaned Fuchs $35,000 to keep the Braves solvent.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{modification}} of the traditional Mundell-Fleming model.

This slight modification of the traditional paradigm leads to radical changes in the effects that fiscal and monetary policies have in economies with high capital mobility under an extreme version of a fixed exchange rate regime (Currency Board).

40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{the internal}} coordination {{between the federal}} government, the Regions and the Communities in Belgium {{before and during the}} 2010 Belgian Presidency of the Council of Ministers. It starts from the observation that the absence of a federal government with full powers, the global financial-economic crisis as well as Belgium’s complex multi-level structure have, counter intuitively, not led to an ineffective internal coordination process. Based on interviews with people who were closely involved in the Belgian <b>Presidency</b> <b>team,</b> the article explains the effectiveness of the internal coordination by arguing that, on the one hand, the detailed and inclusive coordination before the Presidency semester has generated a culture of responsibility and joint ownership among the officials and diplomats and, on the other hand, the Belgian Presidency limited its role to a facilitator of the European decision-making process in function of the rolling agenda of the Commission and the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty. Empirically illustrating these arguments with insights from the internal coordination in the environmental domain, this article demonstrates that an effective internal coordination, even in a difficult political context, can contribute to a successful Presidency...|$|R
