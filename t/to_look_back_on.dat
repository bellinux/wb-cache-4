While the 1999 coins were labeled with their month of issue, the 2000 coins were labeled with the relevant theme (see below).|$|E

25|$|As a group, the {{students}} were {{under the influence of}} Romanian Symbolist clubs, which were at the time the more radical expressions of artistic rejuvenation in Romania. Marcel and Jules Janco's first moment of cultural significance took place in October 1912, when they joined Tzara in editing the Symbolist venue Simbolul, which managed to receive contributions from some of Romania's leading modern poets, from Alexandru Macedonski to Ion Minulescu and Adrian Maniu. The magazine nevertheless struggled to find its voice, alternating modernism with the more conventional Symbolism. Janco was perhaps the main graphic designer of Simbolul, and he may even have persuaded his wealthy parents to support the venture (which closed down in early 1913). Unlike Tzara, who refused <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Simbolul with anything but embarrassment, Janco was proud of this moment in life, depicting it as his first participation in artistic revolution.|$|E
500|$|Affleck is pro-choice. In a 2000 interview, {{he stated}} that he {{believes}} [...] "very strongly in a woman's right to choose". In 2012, he supported the Draw the Line campaign, describing reproductive rights as [...] "fundamental". Affleck was a longtime supporter of legalizing gay marriage, saying in 2004 that he hoped <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the marriage debate [...] "with some degree of embarrassment for how antiquated it was". Also that year, he remarked that it was [...] "outrageous and offensive" [...] to suggest members of the transgender community were not entitled to equal rights. He appeared alongside his gay cousin in a 2005 Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays print advertising campaign. Affleck filmed a public service announcement for Divided We Fail, a nonpartisan AARP campaign seeking affordable, quality healthcare for all Americans, in 2007.|$|E

A participating shop in Istanbul closed following an attack by a gang angered by customers drinking beer and playing music during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fast. Radiohead released a statement saying: [...] "Our hearts go out to those attacked tonight ...

500|$|The album {{title was}} chosen {{in part because}} of nostalgia for the {{historical}} name of the backspace key on typewriters that went out of use in the 1950s and also as a reference <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> one's life. Vedder is known to use typewriters when writing lyrics and letters. Vedder said, [...] "Backspacer [...] actually you kind of have <b>to</b> go <b>back</b> and <b>look</b> at your mistake." [...] Gossard said, [...] "There's some retrospective moods on this record, where Ed is looking at both his past and his future."

500|$|The {{death of}} Sophia Peletier {{is a major}} {{incident}} in [...] "Pretty Much Dead Already", largely affecting the themes of the episode. After the group has shot the walkers housed in Hershel Greene's barn, Sophia appears from the barn as a walker, much to the groups' dismay. A disturbed and distraught Rick Grimes pulls out his weapon and makes the decision to shoot her. Despite being initially surprised about her character's being killed off, Madison Lintz concluded that she understood its aftermath for the show. Lintz affirmed that portraying a walker was a welcoming experience for her, and stated that she was [...] "going <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> and say that was amazing." [...] Robert Kirkman felt that killing Sophia would add more dimension to the show, as well as add more flexibility to its storyline progression. [...] "When a good idea comes up, {{you have to go}} with it," [...] he articulated. [...] "Sophia is a character who is still alive in the comic book series and who has contributed quite a bit to the overall narrative and informed a lot of story lines for a lot of different characters. Having Carol [...] survive her daughter as opposed to the other way around {{as it is in the}} comics is going to lead to interesting but different stories." [...] Although Kirkman was not on set during production of the sequence, Gimple retrieved shell casings from the blanks that were fired on set. Referred to as [...] "Barnageddon" [...] by the writers, Kirkman asserted that he emphasized unpredictability while creating the scene.|$|E

2500|$|In Repentance: A Cosmic Shift of Mind and Heart, Edward J.Anton {{observes that}} in most {{dictionaries}} and {{in the minds of}} most Christians the primary meaning of [...] "repent" [...] is <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> past behavior with sorrow, self-reproach, or contrition, sometimes with an amendment of life.

The officials determined that Wake Forest goalie, Andreu Cases Mundet prevented the ball from crossing the line, causing the game to remain scoreless.

2500|$|Many {{surviving}} colonial {{families and}} their descendants who {{moved back to the}} Netherlands after Independence tended <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the colonial era with a sense of the power and prestige they had in the colony, with such items as the 1970s book Tempo Doeloe (Old times) by author Rob Nieuwenhuys, and other books and materials that became quite common in the 1970s and 1980s. Moreover, since the 18th century Dutch literature has a large number of established authors, such as Louis Couperus, the writer of [...] "The Hidden Force", taking the colonial era as an important source of inspiration.

Dr. Hopper‚Äôs study featured oak-paneling, leather armchairs, and a large fireplace. [...] One wall had the following inscription in Latin: [...] "It will give you pleasure <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> this scene of suffering". [...] JFK believed that giving aid to Britain and France was a moral imperative, no matter what risk it presented to dragging the United States into war.

50|$|Precomputing {{and input}} {{enhancement}} {{can sometimes be}} used synonymously. More specifically, precomputation is the calculation of a given input before anything else is done to the input. Oftentimes a table is generated <b>to</b> be <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> during the actual execution of the algorithm. Input enhancement that calculates values and assigns them to elements of the input can be classified as precomputation, but the similarities stop there. There are sections of input enhancement that do not utilize precomputing and the terms should not be mutually used.|$|R

She allowed him to place a sundial on Hogwarts' grounds, but rejected a graveyard, as that would play an important part in the then unreleased sixth book. Rowling said she [...] "got goosebumps" [...] when she saw several moments in the film, as they inadvertently referred to events in the final two books, she stated [...] "people are going <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the film and think that those were put in deliberately as clues."

2500|$|Potentially in {{contrast}} to Prime Minister Abe's example of his Yasukuni Shrine visits, by February 2015 some concern within the Imperial House of Japan ‚Äî which normally does not issue such statements ‚Äî over the issue was voiced by Crown Prince Naruhito.

2500|$|Two {{mutually}} contradictory explanations {{have been}} put forward that rely on psychosomatic effects. On the one hand, a birthday provides a fixed date to focus on, allowing the terminally ill to hold on until the day itself. On the other hand, a birthday also reminds the individual of mortality and offers an occasion <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> life. According to the terror management theory, this causes stress which can accelerate death. The uneven mortality rate distribution between men and women, and between more and less successful baseball players, suggests that both {{may play a role}} in the birthday effect: people who have focused on the public sphere of life (for example, career-driven people or professional athletes) might be reminded that their glory days have passed, while those who lived more in the private sphere (such as stay-at-home parents and amateur sports players) are more aware of what they will lose in death and try to hold on. Related is the [...] "broken promise effect", whereby a person suffering suicidal ideation will wait until a birthday or other significant event to see whether their circumstances will improve.|$|E
