5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>since</b> Troude's failure, the French {{had only}} sent small supply ships to Guadeloupe, while {{carefully}} preparing a major expedition at Nantes. Two French flûtes, 'Loire, {{under the command}} of lieutenant de vaisseau Joseph Normand-Kergré, and 'Seine, under the coommand of lieutenant de vaisseau Bernard Vincent, took on board large quantities of food supplies and over 200 military reinforcements each. To protect these ships two frigates were detailed to escort the convoy to Guadeloupe: Renommée, under Commodore François Roquebert, and Clorinde, under Captain Jacques Saint-Cricq. The force departed on 15 November 1809 and made rapid progress across the Atlantic, avoiding all contact with British warships. Of the small ships despatched around the same time, none reached Guadeloupe; all were captured in the Western Atlantic or Caribbean by warships sent by Cochrane to patrol for approaching French reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|The second {{development}} was that President Habyarimana {{announced that he}} was introducing multi-party politics into the country, following intense pressure from the international community, including his most loyal ally France. Habyarimana had originally promised this in mid-1990, and a number of opposition groups had formed in <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>since,</b> including the Republican Democratic Movement (MDR), Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Liberal Party (PL), but the one-party state law had remained in place. In mid-1991, Habyarimana officially allowed multi-party politics to begin, a change which saw a plethora of additional new parties come into existence. Many had manifestos which favoured full democracy and rapprochement with the RPF, but in reality were quite ineffective and had no political influence. The older opposition groups registered themselves as official parties, and the country was notionally moving towards a multi-party inclusive cabinet with proper representation, but progress was continually hampered by the regime. The last opposition party to form was the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic (CDR), which was more hardline Hutu than Habyarimana's own party and had close links to the akazu.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{carried out}} final mixing on [...] "It's All Too Much", again at De Lane Lea, on 12 October 1967, while {{completing}} {{work on their}} Magical Mystery Tour EP. In <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>since</b> recording the song, Harrison had sworn off acid after visiting the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco in August, with Boyd, Taylor and others. He said he found himself disillusioned at how, rather than an enlightened micro-society, Haight-Ashbury {{seemed to be a}} haven for dropouts and drug addicts. On 29 September, Harrison and Lennon appeared on David Frost's weekly television show, during which they publicly disavowed LSD, and espoused the benefits of Transcendental Meditation.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1992, the album {{received}} new attention. Although it had been released {{more than a year}} earlier, A Records realized that they had in their catalog what was essentially a collaboration between Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, who had both risen to mainstream attention in <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>since</b> the album's release with their respective albums, Badmotorfinger and Ten. A decided to reissue the album and promote [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] as a single with an accompanying music video that had been previously filmed. The attention allowed both the album and single to chart on Billboard and resulted in a boost in album sales. The album was among the 100 top-selling albums of 1992. Temple of the Dog ended up selling more than a million copies, achieving platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.|$|E
500|$|By {{the spring}} of 1971, George Harrison had {{established}} himself as the most successful ex-Beatle during the former band members' first year as solo artists; {{in the words of}} biographer Elliot Huntley, he [...] "couldn't have got any more popular {{in the eyes of the}} public". Just as importantly, writes Peter Lavezzoli, author of The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, Harrison had [...] "amassed such good will in the music community" [...] during that time. Rather than looking to immediately follow up his All Things Must Pass triple album, he had spent <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>since</b> recording ended in October 1970 repaying favours to the friends and musicians who had helped make the album such a success. These included co-producer Phil Spector, whose wife, Ronnie Spector, Harrison supplied with songs for a proposed solo album on Apple Records; Ringo Starr, whose [...] "It Don't Come Easy" [...] single he produced and prepared for release, following the original session for the song in March 1970; Bobby Whitlock, singer and keyboard player with the short-lived Derek and the Dominos, whose eponymous debut solo album featured Harrison and Eric Clapton on guitar; and former Spooky Tooth pianist Gary Wright, whose Footprint album (1971) Harrison also guested on, along with All Things Must Pass orchestrator John Barham.|$|E
500|$|The episode satirized the {{sex scandal}} {{surrounding}} golf pro Tiger Woods, who had admitted to cheating {{on his wife}} Elin Nordegren with multiple partners. The Woods scandal {{had been one of}} the biggest media stories in <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>since</b> South Parks thirteenth season ended in November 2009. Series co-creator Matt Stone said the scandal provided so much material for satire that an entire season could have been dedicated to it, and the media storm surrounding Woods meant they had even less to worry about the delicacy of their parody. Stone said he was simultaneously fascinated and disgusted by Woods's public apology, so the writers were sure to include it in the episode. The script to [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] was not finished until after March 12, five days before the episode aired. This was in keeping with a continued practice from previous South Park seasons, in which Parker and Stone write and produce their episodes within the week before their broadcast dates in order to harness energy for the final product and keep the material fresh. In an early image of the episode released to the press, Woods is seen at his apology press conference, with Cartman standing beside him. During the production of the episode, the writers decided to incorporate the Tiger Woods scenes as part of the video game that the boys, including Cartman, are playing.|$|E

500|$|From mid 1970, the {{association}} between Harrison and Dylan had created much speculation in the music press, their New York session on 1 May having been hyped up as a [...] "monster" [...] recording marathon in <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>since.</b> Critics were still awaiting Dylan's return to artistic eminence after two albums, Nashville Skyline and the recent Self Portrait, that had caused confusion in rock-music circles. Dylan's influence on All Things Must Pass was detectable [...] "at a number of levels", Ian Inglis writes; in their 1975 book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler described Dylan as a [...] "phantom presence" [...] on Harrison's album, while author Robert Rodriguez labels him an [...] "unmistakable specter". On release, with regards to [...] "I'd Have You Anytime", Rolling Stones Ben Gerson opined that [...] "the two together don't come up with much". More impressed, Alan Smith of the NME described the song as [...] "wistful and touching". In his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner also wrote of Dylan's presence being [...] "strongly felt … in spirit if not in person". Schaffner viewed the [...] "Dylanesque numbers" [...] as [...] "somewhat overshadowed" [...] by those with the obvious Spector Wall of Sound production qualities, but identified songs such as [...] "I'd Have You Anytime", [...] "If Not for You" [...] and [...] "Behind That Locked Door" [...] as being [...] "far more intimate, both musically and lyrically, {{than the rest of}} the album".|$|E
2500|$|The overall {{situation}} {{was described by}} Joystiq thus: [...] "Over <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>since</b> launch, the unpredictable Wii Remote {{has led to a}} maddening dichotomy. Some games are too easy, while others are too hard – for all the wrong reasons...Gamers who crave a deeper challenge have to settle for battling incomprehensible controls." [...] Critics felt that fault was largely attributed to the developers' lack of experience with the Wii Remote. Jeremy Parish of the magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly compared the initial phase of control implementation to that of the Nintendo DS. Matt Casamassina of IGN also presumed that the first generation of Wii games were of an experimental stage and that potential for refinement had yet to be exploited.|$|E

In February Craig Moon, a veteran of the Gannett organization, was announced as the new publisher and promptly withdrew those principles from publication. He also began to personally review, edit, and sometimes kill stories about an Adelson-promoted proposal for a new Las Vegas football stadium.

2500|$|A {{fixture in}} {{entertainment}} news for her lifestyle, Hilton attracted notoriety for her participation in 1 Night in Paris (a sex tape leaked {{before the first}} episode of The Simple Life). Some entertainment writers felt that Hilton's overnight success {{was due to the}} tape. According to Entertainment Weekly, [...] "I dare say the Paris Hilton-Rick Salomon tape received more print and television coverage in a week than the run-up to The Simple Life received in <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>since</b> its premiere was announced. We in the media have become Paris-ites". According to People magazine, the show [...] "no doubt was helped by the very public saga of a pirated three-year-old video tape, which recently made the rounds on the Internet showing Hilton engaged in various sex acts with ex-boyfriend Rick Salomon". Hilton's profile was higher, paparazzi began following her and her relationships, lifestyle and legal issues were targets of gossip sites and tabloid media worldwide.

So habituated were they to this, that they were shocked into consternation at sight of the deserted wheel. They paused for an instant to stare at it. Then Bert Rhine, with a quick word and gesture, sent the Italian, Guido Bombini, around the rear of the half-wheelhouse. The fact that he completed the circuit was proof that nobody was there.|$|E

And now with the disclosures about Bulstrode had come another fact affecting Will's social position, which roused afresh Dorothea's inward resistance to what was said about him {{in that part of}} her world which lay within park palings.|$|E
