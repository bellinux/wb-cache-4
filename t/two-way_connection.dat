50|$|TAMDAR sensors are {{currently}} set to sample at 300 ft intervals on ascent and descent.

The satellite connection to the sensor is a <b>two-way</b> <b>connection</b> so sampling rates, calibration constants, variables and parameters, and reporting frequencies can all be changed remotely from a ground-based location. The sampling rate in cruise is time-based. The soundings, or vertical profiles, are built as each observation is received. All of the profile-based variable calculations (e.g., CAPE, CIN, etc.) are calculated when an aircraft enters cruise or touches down. When an airport is selected, successive soundings can be displayed within a certain time window. This enables the user to view {{the evolution of the}} profile.|$|E
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} referred to as a sexless coupling, because rather than having a male and a female end connected by screw threads, either identical end can be joined to any other end of the same diameter. This is also called hermaphroditic or <b>two-way</b> <b>connection.</b> To couple a Storz connection, the two opposing couplings are pressed together such that the hooks of each one are inserted into the slots in the flange of the other. Then they are rotated in opposite directions until they are tight, or latches engage. This creates a water-tight connection between the internal packing gaskets. To uncouple them, the latches are released and the connectors are turned in the opposite directions from coupling, and then separated when the hooks and slots are aligned. Special wrenches are designed for assisting with use of Storz connectors.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{vertical}} {{structure of the}} Internet {{can be considered as}} being made up of three-level components: backbone-level interconnection, mid-level transit, and local-level access. Furthermore, the connection of networks can be classified into two types: one-way and two-way connections. This paper will analyze one-way and two-way connections and attempt to integrate them with the three-level components model. Three main conclusions will be obtained: first, <b>two-way</b> <b>connection</b> is more socially desirable than one-way connection; second, the cross entry of vertical integrators is more socially desirable than no entry and single entry; third, the local structure of one-way connection and the global structure of <b>two-way</b> <b>connection</b> should be determined at the same time, and, if any, the local bottleneck of one-way connection should be determined afterward rather than beforehand...|$|E

Results replicated previous findings showing reduced inhibitory control (longer stop-signal reaction time) following negative, compared to neutral pictures. Most importantly, results show decreased emotional interference following stop-signal trials. These results show that the inhibitory control component of executive control can serve to decrease emotional effects.

In this article, the author briefly reviews the major areas {{of theory and}} research in the British study of publication administration, further identifying important contributions by British scholars {{in the areas of}} modernist-empiricism, the new public management, regulation, policy networks and governance, and interpretive theory. Although there is a discernible American influence on British public administration, there is little British impact on U. S. public administration; nowadays it is a one-way street. Increasingly, British scholars are involved in a growing community of European public administration scholars with whom they share active, <b>two-way</b> <b>connections.</b> Recent European developments suggest that American and European public administration academics are growing further apart. Due to the immense strength of modernist-empiricism throughout American universities, plus the interpretive turn to a European epistemology of "blurred genres," these twin, traditionally self-referential, communities seem to be parting company with an attendant danger that future intellectual engagement may be a dead end.

We obtain several similar relative computability results not involving Nonstandard Analysis from their associated nonstandard theorems, in particular involving the weak continuity functional. By way of reversal, we show that certain relative computability results, called Herbrandisations, also imply the nonstandard theorem from whence they were obtained.

The paper clarifies what acting as a group member involves, and it analytically characterizes the ‘‘we-mode’’ (thinking and acting as a group member) and the ‘‘I-mode’ ’ (thinking and acting as a private person). The main task of the paper is to clarify cooperation, and this is done by dividing cooperation into I-mode and we-mode cooperation. I-mode cooperation relies on the participants ’ relevantly adjusting their goals toward others’ goals and actions to the benefit of all participants. We-mode cooperation basically amounts to joint action in the we-mode. These kinds of cooperation are also connected to the respective kinds of acting as a group member.

The paper reviwes the most significat literature in the area. There is a <b>two-way</b> <b>connection</b> between relationship marketing and innovation. On one hand, the newly launched product, conceived together with the stakeholders, is likely to generate satisfaction and, hence, customer loyalty and retention, with all known positive consequences.

Nevertheless, it represents only a specific traffic pattern and it is of interest to investigate other traffic patterns where such a simultaneous processing of information flows can bring performance advantage. In this paper we consider a four-way relaying scenario, where each of the two Mobile Stations (MSs) has a <b>two-way</b> <b>connection</b> to the same Base Station (BS), while each connection is through a dedicated Relay Station (RS). The RSs are placed {{in such a way that}} one RS and the terminals associated with it do not interfere with the other RS, and vice versa. We introduce and analyze a two-phase transmission scheme to serve the four-way traffic pattern defined in this scenario. Each phase consists of combined broadcast and multiple access. We analyze the achievable rate region of the new scheme for Decode-and-Forward (DF) operational model for the RS. We compare the performance with a state-of-the-art reference scheme, based on two-way relaying with DF. The results indicate that the achievable rate regions are significantly enlarged for the new scheme. I...|$|E

Each router is configured with {{the set of}} IP addresses belonging to monitored sub-networks. By monitoring <b>two-way</b> <b>connections</b> between the policed set of IP addresses {{and the rest of}} the Internet, our approach can effectively identify malicious network flows consti-tuting DDoS attacks, and consequently restrict attack traffics with rate-limiting techniques. Current source-end DDoS defense scheme cannot accurately distin-guish between network congestion caused by a DDoS attack and that caused by regular events. Under some circumstances, both false positive and false nega-tive can be high, and this reduces the effectiveness of the defense mechanism. To improve the effectiveness, new DDoS detection algorithms are presented in this paper to complement, rather than replace existing source-end DDoS defense COMPUTER SECURITY IN THE 21 CENTURY systems. The design of the proposed detection algorithm is based on three es-sential characteristics of DDoS attacks: distribution, congestion, and continuity. With the three characteristics, the proposed detection algorithm significantly im-proves detection accuracy, and at the same time reduces both false positive and false negative against DDoS attacks...|$|R
