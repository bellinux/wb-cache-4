Closing down of iron ore mines due to environmental constraints spurred the captive iron ore washing plants to workon a custom plant mode and also recover the values from their slimy tails. This paper enumerates the difficulties faced by a captive iron ore fine washing plant [treating iron ore fines assaying Fe∼ 58 % yielding sands assaying Fe> 60 %] due to raw material change yielding unsalable sands {{and discuss the}} importance of process plant audit for improving the mineral processing plant performance. Based on the base line study, laboratory tests on typical samples followed by short term modifications, retrofitting of downstream slime concentrating wet high intensity magnetic separators and dewatering of products could produce readily salable sinter grade [Fe> 60 %] and pellet grade[Fe> 62. 5 %] with an overall increase of concentrate yield by 11. 5 %. Even the previous wash plant <b>tails</b> [which <b>assayed</b> Fe > 45 %] may be reprocessed in the retrofitted slime processing VPWHIMS plant.

This implies that inhibition of FXI can prevent thrombosis without causing bleeding. It was our aim to investigate the antithrombotic properties of two novel inhibitory anti-human FXI antibodies (αFXI- 175 and αFXI- 203). The in vitro properties of both antibodies were analysed using standard clotting assays and calibrated automated thrombography. For the in vivo model we used FXI knockout mice, in which FXI plasma levels were restored with purified human FXI. Thrombosis was induced by applying ferric chloride to the vena cava inferior, after which time to occlusion was analysed. A <b>tail</b> bleeding <b>assay</b> was used to investigate the safety of both antibodies. Using calibrated automated thrombography, both antibodies inhibited thrombin generation initiated via the intrinsic pathway.

In the murine thrombosis model, the vena cava inferior remained patent for 25 minutes (min) in mice treated with αFXI- 175 and for 12. 5 min in αFXI- 203 treated animals, which was significantly longer than in placebo-treated animals (5 min, p < 0. 05).

40|$|Thyroid hormone {{receptor}} (TR) {{can act as}} both a transcriptional activator and a silencer. Optimal activation by TR requires synergism with activator(s) bound to the promoter (promoter proximal activator). It is thought that liganded TR either helps to recruit preinitiation complexes (PIC) to the promoter or activates the PIC already recruited. However, the studies analyzing the TR action on the PIC formation were done in vitro and, therefore, {{it is not clear}} how relevant they are to the in vivo TR action. For example, in vivo, the TR can act from distances equal to or greater than a kilobase from the promoter, but such distant effect is not reproducible in vitro.

We demonstrate that the recruitment of promoter-proximal activator Sp 1, and the components of the basal transcription factors such as TBP, TFIIB, and Cdk 7, is enhanced with thyroid hormone activation. Our results suggest that DNA forms a loop with TR-mediated activation to accommodate interactions between the liganded TR complex and the complex formed on the promoter. We also show that Sp 1 bound to the promoter is essential for the DNA looping and recruitment of basal transcription factors such as TFIIB and Cdk 7 but not for recruitment of TBP.

Starting with the energy requirements in the mining process and continuing through fuel reprocessing and waste storage, an evaluation of both electrical energy requirements and thermal energy requirements of each process was made. All of the energy, direct and indirect, required by the processing of uranium in order to produce electrical power was obtained by adding the quantities for the individual processes.

In this paper are illustrated {{some aspects of the}} modeling of fast centrifuges for UF 6 gas enrichment and of a typical cascade enrichment plant with the Theoretical Centrifuge and Cascade Simulator (TCCS). The background theory for reproducing the flow field characteristics of a centrifuge is derived from the work of Cohen [1] where the separation parameters are calculated using the solution of a differential enrichment equation. In our case we chose to solve the hydrodynamic equations for the motion of a compressible fluid in a centrifugal field using the Berman – Olander vertical velocity radial distribution [2] and the solution was obtained using the Matlab software tool [3]. The importance of a correct estimation of the centrifuge separation parameters at different flow regimes, lies in the possibility to estimate in a reliable way the U enrichment plant performances, once the separation external parameters are set (feed flow rate and feed, product and <b>tails</b> <b>assays)</b> [4]. Using the separation parameters of a single centrifuge allow to determine the performances of an entire cascade and, for this purpose; the software Simulink [3] was used.

This study investigated the parameters of topical capsaicin-induced thermal allodynia in unanesthetized rhesus monkeys and its pharmacological mod-ulation by centrally acting compounds [a -opioid agonist: (5, 7, 8) -() -N-methyl-N-(7 -[1 -pyrrolidinyl]- 1 -oxaspiro [4. 5]dec- 8 -yl) -benzeneacetamide (U 69, 593); and noncom-petitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists: ketamine and MK- 801 (dizocilpine) ]. Rhesus monkeys (n 4) were studied within the warm water <b>tail</b> withdrawal <b>assay</b> (20 -s maximum latency), using thermal stimuli that are normally not noxious (38 and 42 °C).

40|$|Twelve {{derivatives}} of the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) receptor (NOP) antagonist 1 -benzyl-N-{ 3 -[spiroisobenzofuran- 1 (3 H), 4 '-piperidin- 1 -yl]propyl} pyrrolidine- 2 -carboxamide (Comp 24) were synthesized {{and tested}} in binding experiments performed on CHO(hNOP) cell membranes. Among them, a novel interesting NOP receptor antagonist (compound 35) was identified by blending chemical moieties taken from different NOP receptor ligands. In vitro in various assays, Compound 35 consistently behaved as a pure, highly potent (pA(2) {{in the range}} 8. 0 - 9. 9), competitive and NOP selective antagonist. However compound 35 was found inactive when challenged against N/OFQ in vivo in the mouse <b>tail</b> withdrawal <b>assay.</b> Thus, {{the usefulness of the}} novel NOP ligand compound 35 is limited to in vitro investigations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCantagalo virus (CTGV) is the {{etiologic}} agent of a pustular disease in dairy cows and dairy workers in Brazil with important economical and occupational impacts. Nevertheless, no antiviral therapy is currently available. ST- 246 {{is a potent}} inhibitor of orthopoxvirus egress from cells and has proved its efficacy in cell culture and in animal models. In this work, we evaluated the effect of ST- 246 on CTGV replication. Plaque reduction assays indicated that CTGV is 6 – 38 times more susceptible to the drug than VACV-WR and cowpox virus, respectively, with an EC 50 of 0. 0086 μM and a selective index of > 11, 600. The analysis of β-gal activity expressed by recombinant viruses {{in the presence of}} ST- 246 confirmed these results. In addition, ST- 246 had a greater effect on the reduction of CTGV spread in comet <b>tail</b> <b>assays</b> and on the production of extracellular virus relative to VACV-WR. Infection of mice with CTGV by tail scarification generated primary lesions at the site of scarification that appeared less severe than those induced by VACV-WR. Animals infected with CTGV and treated with ST- 246 at 100 mg/kg for 5 days did not develop primary lesions and virus yields were inhibited by nearly 98 %. In contrast, primary lesions induced by VACV-WR were not affected by ST- 246. The analysis of F 13 (p 37) protein from CTGV revealed a unique substitution in residue 217 (D 217 N) not found in other orthopoxviruses. Construction of recombinant VACV-WR containing the D 217 N polymorphism did not lead to an increase in the susceptibility to ST- 246. Therefore, it is still unknown why CTGV is more susceptible to the antiviral effects of ST- 246 compared to VACV-WR. Nonetheless, our data demonstrates that ST- 246 is a potent inhibitor of CTGV replication that should be further evaluated as a promising anti-CTGV therapy...|$|R
40|$|Although not {{recommended}} by mainstream oncologists, intravenous injections of pharmacological ascorbate are currently an alternative therapy option for cancer patients. Research {{has not yet}} determined whether high-dose ascorbate interacts favourably with radiation therapy to increase DNA damage, and therefore cell death in cancer. Some studies suggest that ascorbate {{can act as a}} prooxidant and increase the cytotoxic effect of irradiation in vitro. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a primary brain astrocytoma that is highly therapy resistant, so patients would be advantaged if ascorbate radiosensitised their cancer. In this investigation, flow cytometry and single cell gel electrophoresis (comet <b>tail</b> <b>assay)</b> were used to measure three indicators of DNA damage in GBM cells in response to ascorbate and irradiation, and were contrasted with immunofluorescence-revealed DNA damage from an intracranial mouse model of GBM. The pro-oxidant, radiosensitisation role of ascorbate was confirmed, as measured by H 2 AX, 8 OHdG, and DSBs in vitro. With all three of these markers of DNA damage, combinations of irradiation and ascorbate had increased damage compared with individual treatments. However preliminary in vivo evidence indicates that increased DNA damage did not occur in an animal model of GBM, and in fact ascorbate may protect from DNA damage in an in vivo context. These findings complement previous results from our lab, and serve to fill in gaps in knowledge specifically around the DNA damaging effects of ascorbate. The unique nature of the brain environment, as enclosed by the blood brain barrier, prevents translation of data from other non-brain cancer studies, as such, this investigation also contributes to the exploration of a much needed avenue of research. Considering the context of ascorbate treatment as a potentially harmful currently used adjuvant, it is imperative to confirm or disprove its efficacy in a clinically relevant environment...|$|R
40|$|The neuropeptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) {{selectively}} binds and activates the N/OFQ peptide (NOP) receptor. At cellular level N/OFQ inhibits cAMP accumulation and Ca 2 + conductance and stimulates K+ currents. N/OFQ regulates several biological functions both {{at central}} (pain, locomotion, memory, emotional responses, food intake) and peripheral (airways, cardiovascular, genitourinary and gastrointestinal systems) sites. Potent and selective NOP ligands are now required for investigating the roles played by NOP receptors in pathophysiological studies and for firmly defining the therapeutic indications of NOP receptor ligands. A novel assay to screen NOP receptor ligands has been validated {{with a large}} panel of ligands: the Gaqi 5 chimeric protein {{has been used to}} force the NOP receptor to signal through the Ca 2 + pathway in CHO cells. [Ca 2 +]i levels were monitored using the fluorometer FlexStation II. Data are in general agreement with classical Gi driven assay systems. The NOP peptide partial agonist, ZP 120 was extensively characterized in vitro using electrically stimulated isolated tissues (mouse and rat vas deferens) and in vivo with the <b>tail</b> withdrawal <b>assay.</b> The selective involvement of the NOP receptor in the actions of ZP 120 has been demonstrated in NOP(-/-) mice studies. A detailed pharmacological characterization of the recently identified non-peptide antagonist Compound 24 has been performed. Moreover {{in the context of a}} SAR study on Compound 24, a novel NOP ligand named Compound 35 was identified. Compound 24 and Compound 35 bound the human recombinant NOP receptor expressed in CHOhNOP cell membranes with high affinity (pKi values 9. 62 and 9. 14, respectively). Our findings derived from functional studies on CHOhNOP and bioassay studies on native receptors demonstrated that Compound 24 and Compound 35 behave as potent, competitive and selective non-peptide NOP antagonists. Finally, the NOP antagonist properties of Compound 24 have been confirmed in vivo in the mouse <b>tail</b> withdrawal <b>assay...</b>|$|R
