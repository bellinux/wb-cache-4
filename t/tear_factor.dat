40|$|Wood {{density and}} fibre {{morphology}} of Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis Barrett and Golfari from Fiji were studied {{in relation to}} pulp properties. Densitometry and anatomical measurement were examined using billets taken from a sub-sample of 20 12 - 13 year old trees, chosen as representative of the density range observed in a first sample of 120 trees. Pulping properties were examined at the Tropical Products Institute, London. Considerable differences between trees were found in all characteristics examined and all characteristics showed fairly marked tree to tree variation in development patterns in a radial direction though differences along the stem were small. Between ring differences for ring width, density, cell wall thickness and cell wall percentage were considerable but cell lumen width and cell diameter were fairly constant between rings. Tree morphological characteristics cannot be used for estimation of whole tree values {{for any of the}} features studied. Whole tree values for wood characteristics can be accurately predicted from samples taken at 5 % height level. Characteristic patterns of wood density distribution classes and tracheid cross sectional dimension classes were found, resembling chi-squared, binomial and bimodal curves. Wood properties could be used to predict pulp yield percentage and <b>tear</b> <b>factor</b> accurately by simple regression, less precise estimates could be obtained in this way, for burst factor and breaking length, which were best indicated by cell wall thickness. The best indicators of variation in pulp total yield percentage were chemical properties. Density was the best indicator of <b>tear</b> <b>factor</b> whilst cell wall thickness was {{the most important factor in}} explaining burst factor and breaking length. Growth rate showed negative correlation with wood density; trees of lower density produce paper of a strength generally at least equal to that obtained with higher density trees, though <b>tear</b> <b>factor</b> was lower. Thus the selection of trees for fast growth rate is suggested as the most profitable course. The most desirable selection criteria are listed. </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{project was}} {{developed}} to investigate the potential of coir fibres {{to be used as}} secondary raw material in order to promote environmentally friendly packaging. In addition, old newspapers were embedded in the specimen to hold the coir fibres each other. The main objective was to determine mechanical properties of paper with different beating times and percentages of coir fibres. The responses of this research are tensile index and <b>tear</b> <b>factor.</b> Mechanical pulping process was chosen to produce the pulps in random orientation with cross-machine direction. Regression and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was employed to determine significant differences between percentages of fibres used and beating time for each response variables. The results show that as beating time increased, the mechanical properties of papers increased. Otherwise, the increment of fibres percentages has caused the mechanical paper properties decreased. The combination of 25 % fibres and 75 % newspaper with 20 min of beating time has produced the best mechanical properties.

40|$|Background: The {{development}} in the deinking process has made recycled fiber {{a major part of}} the raw material for pulp and paper industry. Enzymes have revolutionized the deinking process obtaining brightness levels surpassing conventional deinking processes. This study explores the deinking efficiencies of bacterial alkalophilic laccase (L) and xylanase (X) enzymes along with physical deinking methods of microwaving (MW) and sonication (S) for recycling of old newsprint (ONP). Methods and Results: The operational parameters viz. enzyme dose, pH and treatment time for X and L deinking were optimized statistically using Response Surface Methodology. Laccase did not require any mediator supplementation for deinking. Deinking of ONP pulp with a combination of xylanase and laccase enzymes was investigated, and fiber surface composition and morphological changes were studied using X-ray diffraction, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Compared to the pulp deinked with xylanase (47. 9 %) or laccase (62. 2 %) individually, the percentage reduction of effective residual ink concentration (ERIC) was higher for the combined xylanase/laccase-deinked pulp (65. 8 %).

40|$|One of {{the plant}} species which can be {{cultivated}} and enables the industrial plantation forest to be established for its timber/wood utilization is rubber trees. In dealing with rubber wood for pulp/paper processing, the residual latexes, despite in small amount, can bring about some nuisances, i. e. the troubles during the cooking, washing, and bleaching, {{and the appearance of}} dark pitch­spots {{on the surface of the}} resulting pulp/paper sheet. Inherent wich such, the main aim of this research was to remove or reduce to some effective degrees the residual latexes from rubber wood pulp cooked using kraft (sulphate) process by regulating the sulfidity of the cooking liquor (20, 25, 30 %), and by mixing rubber wood with four other wood species, i. e. sengon (Paraserianthes falcataria), jabon (Anthocephalus cadamba), tusam (Pinus merkusii Jungh et de Vries), and ekaliptus (Eucalyptus sp.) each with their specific gravity of 0. 63, 0. 30, 0. 52, and 0. 78, respectively. Changes in suljidity from 20 to 30 percent brought about significant decrease in the number of pitch­spots, caused by the residual latexes, on the surface of the resulting kraft pulp sheet. Meanwhile, changes in mixture between rubber wood and four other wood species with relative proportion (oven­dry weight) from 100 : 0 to 50 : 50, and finally to 25 : 75 brought about also the decrease in the number of pitch­spots. In the same occasion, changing the suljidity from 20 to 25 percent caused the increase in breaking­length from 3170 m to 3615 m (increasing by 14. 04 percent); <b>tear</b> <b>factor</b> from 97. 776 to 111. 100 (increasing by 13. 63 percent); and burst factor from 42. 913 to 53. 623 (increasing by 24. 96 percent). However, further changes in sulfidity from 25 percent to 30 percent brought about the decrease in breaking length and burst factor to 3232 m (decreasing by 10. 59 percent) and 48. 631 (decreasing by 9. 31 percent), respectively. In another case, changes in relative proportion of mixture between rubber wood and four other wood species from 100 : 0 to 25 : 75 induced the significant increase in burst factor and folding endurance from 44. 163 to 54. 357 (increasing by 23. 08 percent) and from 39. 47 to 83. 93 (increasing by 112. 64 percent) ...|$|E

40|$|SIGNIFICANCE: The {{concentration}} of selected proteins and inflammatory mediators in tears of symptomatic and asymptomatic contact lens wearers were quantified. The level of leukotriene B 4 was {{higher in the}} symptomatic group. This may suggest that inflammation can {{be the cause of}} discomfort sensation at the end of day. PURPOSE: The present study aims to quantify the {{concentration of}} selected tear lipids and proteins in symptomatic and asymptomatic contact lens wearers. METHODS: Unstimulated evening tears were collected using glass capillary tubes from 45 healthy, adapted contact lens wearers. Twenty-two had self-described symptoms of dryness and discomfort with contact lenses and 23 were asymptomatic. Tear proteins were assayed using selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. Enzyme immunoassay kits were used to measure prostaglandins, leukotriene B 4, and cysteinyl leukotrienes. Ocular comfort was rated on a scale of 1 to 100 at the time of tear collection. RESULTS: The average evening comfort level was above 70 for the asymptomatic (83. 96 ± 9. 51, mean ± SE) and equal or below 70 for the symptomatic group (57. 28 ± 12. 38) (P. 1) between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The LTB 4 concentration was significantly higher in symptomatic contact lens wearers compared to the asymptomatic group, and this may partly mediate the discomfort response during lens wear in the symptomatic lens wearers.

40|$|Both {{cytotoxic}} and invasive {{strains of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa can damage corneal epithelial cells in vitro, but neither can infect healthy corneas in vivo. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} whole human tear fluid can protect corneal epithelia against P. aeruginosa virulence mechanisms. Cultured corneal epithelial cells were inoculated with 106 CFU of one of 10 strains of P. aeruginosa (five cytotoxic, five invasive) /ml with or without reflex tear fluid collected from the conjunctival sacs of human volunteers. Cytotoxicity was assessed by observation of trypan blue staining and measurement of lactate dehydrogenase release; invasion was quantified by using gentamicin survival assays. Tear fluid retarded growth of only 50 % of the P. aeruginosa strains (three of five invasive strains, two of five cytotoxic strains) yet protected corneal cells against invasion by or cytotoxicity of 9 of 10 strains. The only strain resistant to the tear cytoprotective effects was susceptible to tear bacteriostatic activity. Dilution of tear fluid threefold significantly reduced cytoprotection, while bacteriostatic activity prevailed with dilutions beyond 100 -fold. Sulfacetamide (1 mg/ml) with bacteriostatic activity matching that of tear fluid was less cytoprotective than tear fluid (80 % protection with tear fluid, 48 % with sulfacetamide). Video microscopy revealed bacterial chain formation in both tear fluid and sulfacetamide, but tear fluid also blocked bacterial swimming motility. After prolonged tear contact, bacteria regained normal growth rates, swimming motility, and cytotoxic activity, suggesting a breakdown of protective <b>tear</b> <b>factors.</b> Boiled <b>tear</b> fluid lost bacteriostatic activity and effects on bacterial motility but retained cytoprotective function.

The intensity of these alterations has been correlated with {{the distribution of the}} atheromatous plaques and thrombosis {{as well as with the}} effective tension at various levels as calculated by Burton's formula. Evidence is presented for the concept that the lipids in atherom-atous plaques arise as a product of these degenerative reactions within the vessel wall, rather than by diffusion from the circulation through the endothelial barrier. IN PREVIOUS reports we have defined aging processes in blood vessels as those alterations resulting from the effects of wear and <b>tear</b> <b>factors</b> which have been operat-ing over a relatively long period of time. 1 - 6 Specifically, these investigations have dealt with the comparative rates of degeneration, new formation and subsequent calcification of the elastic elements of arteries in various ana-tomic sites. In general, intimal plaques were observed to occur most frequently in those arteries in which these alterations were most marked along the internal elastic zone, and it was further pointed out that physical factors play an important role in the point of localiza-tion and rate of development of these plaques. Thus, the lower portion of the aorta and the coronary arteries show a relatively rapid de-velopment of aging processes and a high rate of occurrence of intimal plaques, while the hepatic and pulmonary arteries show athero-mata rarely and only a slow and mild progres-sion of elastic tissue calcification.

Participants attributed individuals who were crying in employment conditions with greater female-stereotypical traits of emotionality and sensitivity, in addition to lower levels of competence and determination.

40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} effect of {{pranoprofen}} eye drops on corneal endothelium and <b>tears</b> inflammatory <b>factors</b> in perioperative period of cataract surgery. METHODS: Totally 60 cases(60 eyes) of senile cataract patients were enrolled in this study. Patients with diabetes or other systemic diseases, with other eye diseases or eye surgery, drug allergy were excluded. All the patients were given ophthalmic surgery for the first time. All the patients were randomly divided into 4 groups, 15 patients per group. Each group of patients had been given levofloxacin eye drops preoperatively for 3 d, 4 times per day, and tobramycin dexamethasone eye drops postoperatively, 3 times per day for the first week, 2 times per day for the second week. Group A was the control group, without any other drugs. Group B was given pranoprofen eye drops 4 times per day for 3 d before the operation. Group C was given pranoprofen eye drops 4 times per day for 1 wk after the operation. Group D was given pranoprofen eye drops 4 times per day for 3 d before the operation and 1 wk after the operation. All the surgeries were done by the same ophthalmologist, using the same phacoemulsification machine and the same ultrasound energy parameters. The loss rate of endothelial cell was measured by corneal endothelium counterometry. Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and tumor necrosis factor(TNF) in the tear fluid were measured by ELISA before surgery(before using eye drops) and 1 wk, 1 mo and 3 mo postoperatively. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference}} in patients' gender, age and phacoemulsification time among 4 groups. The levels of inflammatory cytokines IL- 6 in the tear fluid of the Group B before surgery had no significant difference compared to that at 3 mo postoperatively(P > 0. 05), but the differences among the other groups at different time points were statistically significant(P P > 0. 05). At 1 wk after the operation, there was significant difference between the Group A and the other three groups(P P P > 0. 05). At 1 mo after the operation, there was significant difference between the Group A and the other three groups(P P P > 0. 05). At 3 mo after the operation, there was significant difference between the Group A and the other three groups(P P > 0. 05). The levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF in the tear fluid at different time points among each group were significantly different(P P > 0. 05). At 1 w after the operation, there was significant difference between the Group A and the other three groups(P P > 0. 05). At 1 mo after the operation, there was significant difference between the Group A and the other three groups(P P P > 0. 05). At 3 mo after the operation, there was significant difference between the Group A and the other three groups(P P > 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Pranoprofen eye drops have no effect on the loss rate of corneal endothelium. Pranoprofen eye drops could significantly reduced the <b>tears</b> inflammatory <b>factors</b> in perioperative period of cataract surgery. The role to reduce inflammatory cytokines in the postoperative application of pranoprofen eye drops is not obvious compared to other two modes of administration, but the difference is not statistically significant at 3 mo. The administration of preoperative and postoperative use of pranoprofen eye drops has no significant advantage in reducing inflammatory cytokines compared with only preoperative use...|$|R
40|$|AIM—To {{demonstrate}} {{the efficacy of}} a petrolatum based calcium ointment applied to the lower lid skin {{in the management of}} dry eye.  METHODS—In a controlled double masked study, the effects of water free petrolatum ointment containing calcium carbonate (10 % w/w) on <b>tear</b> functional <b>factors</b> and ocular surface vital staining in dry eye patients were observed. Petrolatum without calcium carbonate served as control. Patients were instructed to place ointment to the lower lid skin twice a day. Evaluation of subjective complaints, fluorescein and rose bengal staining patterns, blink rate, tear evaporation and tear break up time (BUT) were performed before and 3  months after treatment. In order to {{demonstrate the}} movement of petrolatum from the skin to the tear film, petrolatum containing 1 % sodium fluorescein was placed on the lower lid of four healthy volunteers, and the concentration of fluorescein in the tear film was followed up to 6  hours using an anterior fluorometer.  RESULTS—Subjective symptoms significantly improved in both the calcium group (p= 0. 001) and control (p= 0. 012), while only the calcium group demonstrated a significant improvement in fluorescein (p= 0. 043), rose bengal (p= 0. 021) scores, and blink rate (p= 0. 004). Tear evaporation also significantly decreased in both the calcium group (p= 0. 0004) and control (0. 043). BUT did not improve in either group.  CONCLUSION—Petrolatum based calcium ointment significantly improved symptoms, tear dynamics, and ocular surface staining in dry eye patients. However, some of the therapeutic effects may be due to lipids in the petrolatum vehicle. Petrolatum applied to the lower lid skin is an effective drug delivery system for slowly releasing drugs to the ocular surface. ...|$|R

Statistical analysis was used to study the correlation between LF levels and results of both Schirmer’s and tear film break-up time tests and the age of the subject. Results: The concentration of LF was significantly decreased in the tears of dry eye subjects compared with control subjects (P< 0. 001). There is a positive relationship between LF in tears and results from Schirmer’s and tear film break-up time tests in non-Sjgren’s syndrome (r= 0. 48 and 0. 78 respectively P< 0. 001), while there is a negative relationship between LF and age (r =- 0. 74, P< 0. 005). Conclusions: Decreased LF in <b>tears</b> is a <b>factor</b> in the pathology of dry eye. When treating non-Sjgren’s syndrome, treatment with LF could be added to artificial tear treatment...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of sphincter rupture during childbirth {{has increased in}} Sweden from half percent to three percent from 1973 to 1993. Women who undergo planned home birth have sphincter injuries to a smaller extent than women who undergo planned hospital births. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe women’s experience of the last stages of delivery during planned home birth. Design: Inductive content analysis of 150 randomly selected delivery reports. The delivery reports were gathered as a reply to an open question in a previously conducted survey. Findings: The woman´s confidence in the natural birthing process emerged as the overall theme of the delivery reports. Fourteen subcategories and five categories emerged during the analysis process: experience of support, physical experience, psychological experience, experience of birthplace and birth position and the woman’s awareness during birth. Conclusion: The support from the surrounding people was very important for the women and they felt calm and secure in the home environment. The women often gave birth in a birthing position that led to a reduced risk of perineal <b>tears.</b> Many risk <b>factors</b> for sphincter injuries were eliminated for the women who went thru planned home birth. For example the women often had experiences of prior deliveries and further no medical instruments were used during late stages of delivery in planned home births...|$|R
40|$|Single-cycle and multiple-cycle {{proof testing}} (SCPT and MCPT) {{strategies}} for reusable aerospace propulsion system components are critically evaluated and compared from a rigorous elastic-plastic fracture mechanics perspective. Earlier MCPT studies are briefly reviewed. New J-integral estimation methods for semielliptical surface cracks and cracks at notches are derived and validated. Engineering methods are developed to characterize crack growth rates during elastic-plastic fatigue crack growth (FCG) and the tear-fatigue interaction near instability. Surface crack growth experiments are conducted with Inconel 718 to characterize tearing resistance, FCG under small-scale yielding and elastic-plastic conditions, and crack growth during simulated MCPT. Fractography and acoustic emission studies provide additional insight. The relative merits of SCPT and MCPT are directly compared using a probabilistic analysis linked with an elastic-plastic crack growth computer code. The conditional {{probability of failure}} in service is computed for a population of components that have survived a previous proof test, based on an assumed distribution of initial crack depths. Parameter studies investigate the influence of proof <b>factor,</b> <b>tearing</b> resistance, crack shape, initial crack depth distribution, and notches on the MCPT versus SCPT comparison. The parameter studies provide a rational basis to formulate conclusions about the relative {{advantages and disadvantages of}} SCPT and MCPT. Practical engineering guidelines are proposed to help select the optimum proof test protocol in a given application...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} bone and soft tissue abnormalities in asymptomatic knees using peripheral magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI) and {{to examine the relationship}} between these abnormalities and Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) graded X-rays. MethodVolunteers (20 – 68 years) with no history of knee pain, injury or bone or joint disease were recruited. Individuals underwent a single MRI scan and radiograph of their non-dominant knee. pMR images were acquired in sagittal plane using a 3 -D gradient-echo protocol. Two radiologists graded the presence and severity of cartilage degeneration, osteophytosis, meniscal and ligamentous abnormalities, bone marrow edema and subchondral cysts. X-rays were acquired using a fixed-flexion technique and graded using the K-L scale. ResultsForty-four individuals, mean age (SD) 41. 1 (14. 2) years, participated. K-L grading of X-rays revealed 29 individuals were grade 0, 12 were grade 1 and 3 were grade 2. Five individuals showed evidence of cartilage lesions, the femoral trochlea, medial femur and patella being those regions most commonly affected. Twelve individuals (27. 3 %) showed evidence of osteophytosis, nine of whom did not show evidence on X-ray. Forty-three individuals showed evidence of at least one meniscal abnormality while 27 individuals (61. 4 %) had abnormalities in at least three of the four regions of the knee. ConclusionOur results suggest that osteophytes may be more prevalent in this population than radiographic data suggests due to the limitations of two-dimensional imaging. Meniscal degeneration or <b>tears,</b> a risk <b>factor</b> for knee osteoarthritis, are highly prevalent in asymptomatic individuals with the medial anterior and posterior horns being the most commonly affected regions...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} time needed from a surgeon's {{viewpoint}} to treat a patient operated for lumbar spinal stenosis. We firstly aimed to give evidence of the wide ranging duration of standardized procedure. Secondly, we investigated factors affecting the time allocated to each patient. Methods: 438 medical records of patients operated on for lumbar decompression without fusion (2005 - 2011) were retrospectively examined. Primary data were operative time (OT, min), length of stay (LoS, days) and number of postoperative visits. A fourth parameter was calculated, the time spent per patient (TSPP, min) by summing the time spent in surgery, during inpatient and outpatient follow-up visits. Factors that influenced these medical resources were examined. Results: Median (5 th- 95 th percentile) LoS was 5 days (2 - 15), OT 106 min (60 - 194), number of medical visits 5 (2 - 11) and TSPP 329 min (206 - 533). In descending order, factors predicting LoS were age, no. of levels, sex, operative technique, cardiovascular risk index, dural <b>tear</b> and haematoma. <b>Factors</b> predicting OT were number of levels, dural tear, foraminotomy, synovial cyst and body mass index. The statistical model could predict 36 % of the TSPP variance. We recommend that surgeons add 35 min for each level, 29 min for patients over 65 years, 30 min for women, 132 min for dural tear and 108 min for epidural haematoma. Conclusion: TSPP treated for lumbar spinal stenosis is highly variable, yet partially predictable. These data may help individual surgeons or heads of departments to plan their activities. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{and compare the}} cytopathological and clinical effects of amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) and oral mucosal membrane transplantation (OMMT) in socket contraction. METHODS: Twelve patients {{who could not be}} fitted with ocular prosthesis due to socket contracture were included in this study. Seven patients underwent AMT and 5 patients underwent OMMT. Thirteen patients who had healthy sockets were included as control group. Depth of inferior fornix, degree of inflammation, extent of the socket contracture and socket volume were measured in the preoperative period and at sixth and twelfth weeks postoperatively. Impression cytology of conjunctival fornices and <b>tear</b> transforming growth <b>factor</b> beta- 1 (TGFβ 1) levels were determined. RESULTS: In the AMT group,socket volume and lower fornix depth values were significantly higher (P = 0. 030 and P = 0. 004 respectively) and inflammation levels and impression cytology stages (P = 0. 037 and P = 0. 022 respectively) were significantly lower in postoperative period compared to preoperative period. In the OMMT group, no statistical differences were found in terms of clinical parameters, inflammation levels and impression cytology stages of preoperative versus postoperative values. Preoperative tear TGFβ 1 levels were higher in AMT and OMMT groups compared to the control group (25. 5 ng/mL, 26. 3 ng/mL and 21. 7 ng/mL respectively). Decreased tear TGFβ 1 levels were observed in both the AMT and OMMT groups postoperatively (median decrease value= 2. 1 ng/mL and 2. 7 ng/mL respectively). CONCLUSION: AMT is associated with postoperative improvement in inferior fornix depth, socket volume, inflammation and impression cytology levels and may be a more proper alternative method than OMMT in the management of socket contracture...|$|R
40|$|The study byMall et al. is an important, {{clinically}} relevant {{investigation that}} highlights {{the natural history}} of rotator cuff disease and specifically looks at the progression of asymptomatic <b>tears</b> and the <b>factors</b> associated with this progression. While rotator cuff disease {{is one of the most}} common orthopaedic conditions, little is known about its natural history 1. The purposes of this study were to identify what happens when an asymptomatic tear becomes symptomatic and to determine what factors are associated with a tear becoming symptomatic. The authors studied a large prospective cohort of 195 patients with asymptomatic rotator cuff tears over a five-year period and found that 23 % (forty-four) had pain develop after a relatively short time of approximately two years. The patients whose tears became symptomatic were compared with those who remained pain-free 2. The authors found that larger tears were more likely to become symptomatic and that tear progression was associated with increased tear size (both for full-thickness and partial-thickness tears), decreased American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores, decreased shoulder range of motion, and increased compensatory scapulothoracic motion. They did not find an association with shoulder external rotation strength or fatty infiltration on imaging studies. They concluded that pain development in shoulders with asymptomatic rotator cuff tears was associated with an increase in tear size and that larger asymptomatic tears were more likely to become symptomatic. A goal of this study was to help to identify patients who were at risk and, conversely, those who were not at risk so that the appropriate surgical or nonsurgical interventions could be recommended. As a clinician who routinely sees patients with rotator cuff tears, this study is very helpful from both patient and surgeon perspectives...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- Episodic {{paroxysmal}} hemicrania (EPH) {{is a rare}} disorder {{characterized by}} frequent, daily attacks of short-lived, unilateral headache with accompanying ipsilateral autonomic features. EPH has attack periods which last weeks to months separated by remission intervals lasting months to years, however, a seasonal variation has never been reported in EPH. We report a new case of EPH with a clear seasonal pattern: a 32 -year-old woman with a right-sided headache for 17 years. Pain occurred with a seasonal variation, with bouts lasting one month (usually in {{the first months of}} the year) and remission periods lasting around 11 months. During these periods she had headache from three to five times per day, lasting from 15 to 30 minutes, without any particular period preference. There were no precipitating or aggravating <b>factors.</b> <b>Tearing</b> and conjunctival injection accompanied ipsilaterally the pain. Previous treatments provided no pain relief. She completely responded to indomethacin 75 mg daily. After three years, the pain recurred with longer attack duration and was just relieved with prednisone. We also propose a new hypothesis: the EPH-cluster headache continuum. KEY WORDS: episodic paroxysmal hemicrania, chronobiological dysfunction, EPH-cluster headache continuum. Hemicrânia paroxística episódica com variação sazonal: relato de caso e hipótese do continuum HPE-cefaléia em salvas RESUMO- A hemicrânia paroxística episódica (HPE) é um tipo raro de cefaléia em que ocorrem breves episódios de intensa cefaléia hemicrânica, recorrendo várias vezes por dia e acompanhada de sinais autonômicos ipsilaterais. Estas dores se repetem, em geral, por períodos sintomáticos que duram de semanas a meses, separados por intervalos assintomáticos de meses a anos; no entanto, uma variação sazonal nunca foi relatada nesses casos. Descreveremos um caso de HPE com um nítido padrão sazonal. Trata-se de mulher de 32 anos, que referia dor hemicrânica à direita, mas principalmente periorbitária, em queimação, há 17 anos. A dor sempre ocorria durante 1 mês e com intervalos assintomáticos de 11 meses. Durante períodos sintomáticos...|$|R
