25|$|The {{first major}} area in {{semantic}} analysis is {{the identification of}} the intended meaning at the word level (taken to include idiomatic expressions).

The tasks in this area include lexical sample and all-word disambiguation, multi- and cross-lingual disambiguation, and lexical substitution. Given the difficulties of identifying word senses, other tasks relevant to this topic include word-sense induction, subcategorization acquisition, and evaluation of lexical resources.|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{functions}} of botanical gardens have already been discussed in the sections above, which emphasise the scientific underpinning of botanical gardens with their focus on research, education and conservation. However, as multifaceted organisations, all sites have their own special interests. In a remarkable paper {{on the role of}} botanical gardens, Ferdinand Mueller (1825–1896), the director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne (1852–1873), stated, [...] "in all cases the objects [...] must be mainly scientific and predominantly instructive".

500|$|Farsari {{and other}} 19th-century {{commercial}} photographers generally concentrated on {{two types of}} subject matter: the scenery of Japan and the [...] "manners and customs" [...] of its inhabitants. Such subjects, and <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were literally and figuratively framed, were chosen to appeal to foreign taste; {{and the reason for}} this, apart from the photographer's individual aesthetics, vision and preconceptions, {{had much to do with}} economics. Photographs were expensive to make and accordingly expensive to buy. In 1870s Japan, a portrait photograph usually cost half a ryō [...] "per head", about a month's pay for an artisan. Given such pricing, few Japanese could afford photographs and a photographer's clientele was largely drawn from the foreign residents of the European and American enclaves: colonial administrators, missionaries, merchants and the military. By the early 1870s, tourists had joined their number. To appeal to this clientele, photographers often staged and contrived the scenes they photographed, particularly the portraits depicting [...] "manners and customs".|$|E
500|$|However, {{despite these}} {{widespread}} feelings of fatalism, some men {{believe that they}} can avoid HIV contraction by modifying their personal behaviors. Men who decide to change their behaviors to reduce their risk of infection are unlikely to use condoms consistently, particularly during marital intercourse; instead, they usually continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations, but alter <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> choose their sexual partners. For example, before selecting extramarital sexual partners, men sometimes survey their peers to determine whether their potential partners are likely to have exposed themselves to the virus. Men who choose their sexual partners based on external appearances and peer recommendations often believe that women who violate traditional gender norms by, for example, wearing modern clothing are more likely to carry HIV, while young girls, who are perceived as sexually inexperienced, are considered [...] "pure." [...] Because of this perception, many people are concerned that schoolchildren in Malawi, particularly girls, are becoming exposed to the virus through sexual harassment or abuse by their instructors.|$|E

2500|$|As explained, REBT is a {{therapeutic}} system of both theory and practices; generally {{one of the}} goals of REBT is to help clients see <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> have learned how they often needlessly upset themselves, teach them how to [...] "un-upset" [...] themselves and then how to empower themselves to lead happier and more fulfilling lives. The emphasis in therapy is generally to establish a successful collaborative therapeutic working alliance based on the REBT educational model. Although REBT teaches that the therapist or counsellor is better served by demonstrating unconditional other-acceptance or unconditional positive regard, the therapist is not necessarily always encouraged to build a warm and caring relationship with the client. The tasks of the therapist or counselor include understanding the client’s concerns from his point of reference and work as a facilitator, teacher and encourager.|$|E

The simplest procedure is that followed by many species of Anopheles; like many other gracile species of aquatic insects, females just fly over the water, bobbing up {{and down to the}} water surface and dropping eggs more or less singly. The bobbing behavior occurs among some other aquatic insects as well, for example mayflies and dragonflies; it is sometimes called [...] "dapping". The eggs of Anopheles species are roughly cigar-shaped and have floats down their sides. Females of many common species can lay 100–200 eggs {{during the course of the}} adult phase of their lifecycles. Even with high egg and intergenerational mortality, over a period of several weeks, a single successful breeding pair can create a population of thousands.|$|E
