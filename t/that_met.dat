5|$|Although Platt desired a recess, Hanna refused, {{wanting the}} {{convention}} to complete its work that day, and the delegates proceeded {{to the presidential}} nomination. McKinley had insisted that Foraker nominate him to demonstrate {{the unity of the}} Ohio Republican Party, and after some reluctance by the senator-elect, who feared blame if anything went wrong, Foraker agreed. McKinley was waiting with family and friends at his house in Canton, being kept up to date by telegraph and telephone. He was able to listen to part of Foraker's speech, and the tremendous reception <b>that</b> <b>met</b> it, over the phone line. McKinley was easily nominated on the first ballot, with Reed his nearest competitor. Canton erupted in celebration, with McKinley making speech after speech to the townsfolk and to those who poured in that day by rail from across Ohio, even from his birthplace of Niles.|$|E
5|$|As {{the project}} neared its conclusion, American {{planners}} began {{to consider the}} use of the bomb. Groves formed a committee <b>that</b> <b>met</b> in April and May 1945 to draw up a list of targets.

The targeting committee's list included 18 Japanese cities. At {{the top of the list}} were Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Kokura, and Niigata. Ultimately, Kyoto was removed from the list at the insistence of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who had visited the city on his honeymoon and knew of its cultural and historical significance.|$|E

The delegation included two short-distance runners and one judoka: Kenneth Medwood, Kaina Martinez and Eddermys Sanchez. Medwood qualified by recording a time <b>that</b> <b>met</b> qualification standards while the latter two entered through wildcard places.

Improvements to Intel's mobile processors, along with a decision by Microsoft to remove OEM license fees for Windows on devices with screens smaller than 9 inches, spurred a market for low-end Wintel tablets running the full Windows 8 platform. These devices largely cannibalized Windows RT; vendors began phasing out their Windows RT devices due to poor sales, and {{less than a year after}} its release, Microsoft suffered a US$900 million loss that was largely blamed on poor sales of the ARM-based Surface tablet and unsold stock.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} literature {{on the impact of}} the medical emergency team (MET) on inpatient mortality,cardiopulmonary arrests or unscheduled intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. A total of 14 172 abstracts and 98 full text papers were reviewed. In total, 24 met the inclusion criteria, 2 used a cluster-randomized controlled trial, 11 before and after, 6 retrospective analyses, 4 prospective cohorts and 1 not reported. There is moderate to strong evidence <b>that</b> <b>METs</b> are associated with decreased mortality and cardiac arrest rates, and weak evidence on its impact on ICU admission rate reductions. This evidence suffers from the flaws with only two randomized controlled trials examining differing outcome measures with differing results. Poor methodology and failure to report both quality improvement co-interventions and time response rates of METs, limit the strength of the evidence <b>that</b> <b>METs</b> are effective interventions for preventing mortality, code rates or unscheduled ICU admissions. Studies with improved implementation practices and evaluation of the efficacy of MET is warranted...|$|R
