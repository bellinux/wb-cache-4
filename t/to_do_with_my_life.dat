It's a waste of time on my part because it drains me from doing what I really want to do, which is just to play music." [...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I just feel I'm doing the job. My job is to play music and deliver the show ... It's more emotional for the audience ... what they sort of think you are." [...] He states that one of his motivations is [...] "ideally to induce states of meditation and ecstasy, as well as to make people think".|$|E

You have had more <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> than you think:" [...] and, taking up the lamp, {{he opened the door and}} went in. A cold current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in a flame of murky orange. He shuddered. [...] "Shut the door behind you," [...] he whispered, as he placed the lamp on the table.|$|E

6000|$|... 'That's {{just the}} difficulty, sir. How am I {{to get at}} her? But you may be sure of this, I mean to do it. If I were beat I do think that then I should go back and bury myself in the gold-mines. You asked me what I meant to do about my future life. That is my purpose. If she were my wife I should consult her. We might travel part of the time, and I might have a farm. I should always look upon Folking as home.

60|$|What was I <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> now? What was {{to become}} of my life? I can still recall the sense of blank unanswerableness with which these {{questions}} dominated my mind, and associated with it is an effect {{of myself as a}} small human being, singular and apart, wandering through a number of London landscapes. At one time I was in a great grey smoke-rimmed autumnal space of park, much cut up by railings and worn by cricket pitches, far away from any idea of the Thames, and in the distance over the tops of trees I discovered perplexingly the clustering masts and spars of ships. I have never seen that place since. Then the Angel at Islington is absurdly mixed up with the distresses of this day. I attempted some great detour thence, and found myself with a dumb irritation returning to the place from another direction. I remember too a wide street over which passes a thundering railway bridge borne upon colossal rounded pillars of iron, and carrying in white and blue some big advertisement, I think of the Daily Telegraph. Near there I thought a crowd was gathered about the victim of some accident, and thrusting myself among the people with a vague idea of help, discovered a man selling a remedy for corns. And somewhere about this north region I discovered I was faint with hunger, and got some bread and cheese and beer in a gaudily decorated saloon bar with a sanded floor. I resisted a monstrous impulse to stay in that place and drink myself into inactivity and stupefaction with beer.|$|E

5000|$|Years ago I had the {{experience}} of sitting around in a living room with a bunch of people and singing and playing, and it was like a spiritual experience, it was wonderful. And I decided then that was what I was going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> was play music, do music. In the making of records, I think over the years we've all gotten a little too technical, a little too hung up on getting things perfect. We've lost the living room.

5000|$|At 13, {{he went to}} see {{the play}} Dracula, {{starring}} Bela Lugosi, and was entranced. He watched performance after performance, eventually managing to meet Lugosi himself. He wrote in his autobiography Step Right Up! I'm Gonna Scare the Pants off America, [...] "I knew then what I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> - I wanted to scare the pants off audiences." [...] Lugosi recommended him for the position of assistant stage manager for the road company tour of the play. The 15-year-old {{dropped out of high school}} to take the job. He spent his teenage years working on Broadway in jobs ranging from set building to acting. This proved good training for the future filmmaker.|$|E
5000|$|Following his {{stint in}} jail and done with {{performing}} in punk bands, Palermo {{spent a long time}} soul-searching. He said: [...] "I didn't know what else <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> what would make me want to wake up every day. I really struggled with that for like four years and, not to sound dramatic or anything, but I thought about blowing my brains out every day". Palermo eventually began making music again, and released a demo titled Poshlost under the name [...] "Nothing" [...] in 2011. Nothing went through several lineup changes {{over the next few years}} while releasing two EPs, Suns and Lovers and Downward Years to Come in 2012.|$|E

5000|$|In 1977, Lovell {{traveled}} to Spain to study {{painting and sculpture}} with Manhattanville College. At El Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain, {{he decided that he}} would become a painter. Lovell has said: [...] I knew I would go into some form of art, but I wasn't sure which. I was interested in fashion and advertising as options. But while I {{was standing in front of}} a Velasquez painting I had an amazing spiritual experience. The painter had communicated with me through centuries and cultures, and I suddenly understood the role of the artist. I ran from room to room. Goya, El Greco, Reubens, and Picasso all began to speak out to me. Whatever they were doing in those rooms was what I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
