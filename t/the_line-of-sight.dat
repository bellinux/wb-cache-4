5|$|In {{interstellar}} astronomy, visible spectra {{can appear}} redder due to scattering processes in a phenomenon {{referred to as}} interstellar reddening – similarly Rayleigh scattering causes the atmospheric reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and causes {{the rest of the}} sky to have a blue color. This phenomenon is distinct from redshifting because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered in and out of <b>the</b> <b>line-of-sight.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{detection}} of the Zeeman effect in another galaxy was made through observations of hydroxyl megamasers. The Zeeman effect is the splitting of a spectral line {{due to the}} presence of a magnetic field, {{and the size of the}} splitting is linearly proportional to <b>the</b> <b>line-of-sight</b> magnetic field strength. Zeeman splitting has been detected in five hydroxyl megamasers, and the typical strength of a detected field is of order a few milligauss, similar to the field strengths measured in galactic hydroxyl masers.|$|E

5|$|The {{rotational}} velocity of Beta Pictoris has been measured {{to be at}} least 130km/s. Since this value is derived by measuring radial velocities, this is a lower limit on the true {{rotational velocity}}: the quantity measured is actually v sin(i), where i represents the inclination of the star's axis of rotation to <b>the</b> <b>line-of-sight.</b> If it is assumed that Beta Pictoris is viewed from Earth in its equatorial plane, a reasonable assumption since the circumstellar disk is seen edge-on, the rotation period can be calculated as approximately 16 hours, which is significantly shorter than that of the Sun (609.12 hours).|$|E
5|$|In nearby objects (within our Milky Way galaxy) {{observed}} redshifts {{are almost}} always related to <b>the</b> <b>line-of-sight</b> velocities associated with the objects being observed. Observations of such redshifts and blueshifts have enabled astronomers to measure velocities and parametrize the masses of the orbiting stars in spectroscopic binaries, a method first employed in 1868 by British astronomer William Huggins. Similarly, small redshifts and blueshifts detected in the spectroscopic measurements of individual stars are one way astronomers {{have been able to}} diagnose and measure the presence and characteristics of planetary systems around other stars and have even made very detailed differential measurements of redshifts during planetary transits to determine precise orbital parameters. Finely detailed measurements of redshifts are used in helioseismology to determine the precise movements of the photosphere of the Sun. Redshifts have also been used to make the first measurements of the rotation rates of planets, velocities of interstellar clouds, the rotation of galaxies, and the dynamics of accretion onto neutron stars and black holes which exhibit both Doppler and gravitational redshifts. Additionally, the temperatures of various emitting and absorbing objects can be obtained by measuring Doppler broadening – effectively redshifts and blueshifts over a single emission or absorption line. By measuring the broadening and shifts of the 21-centimeter hydrogen line in different directions, astronomers have been able to measure the recessional velocities of interstellar gas, which in turn reveals the rotation curve of our Milky Way. Similar measurements have been performed on other galaxies, such as Andromeda. As a diagnostic tool, redshift measurements {{are one of the most}} important spectroscopic measurements made in astronomy.|$|E
25|$|The major {{limitation}} with Doppler spectroscopy {{is that it}} {{can only}} measure movement along <b>the</b> <b>line-of-sight,</b> and so depends on a measurement (or estimate) of the inclination of the planet's orbit to determine the planet's mass. If the orbital plane of the planet happens to line up with <b>the</b> <b>line-of-sight</b> of the observer, then the measured variation in the star's radial velocity is the true value. However, if the orbital plane is tilted away from <b>the</b> <b>line-of-sight,</b> then the true effect of the planet on the motion of the star will be greater than the measured variation in the star's radial velocity, which is only the component along <b>the</b> <b>line-of-sight.</b> As a result, the planet's true mass will be greater than measured.|$|E

25|$|To {{correct for}} this effect, and so {{determine}} the true mass of an extrasolar planet, radial-velocity measurements {{can be combined}} with astrometric observations, which track {{the movement of the}} star across the plane of the sky, perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>line-of-sight.</b> Astrometric measurements allows researchers to check whether objects that appear to be high mass planets {{are more likely to be}} brown dwarfs.|$|E
25|$|On October 16, 2002, an {{international}} {{team led by}} Reinhard Genzel of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics reported the observation of {{the motion of the}} star S2 near Sagittarius A* over a period of ten years. According to the team's analysis, the data ruled out the possibility that Sgr A* contains a cluster of dark stellar objects or a mass of degenerate fermions, strengthening the evidence for a massive black hole. The observations of S2 used near-infra red (NIR) interferometry (in the K-band, i.e. 2.2 μm) because of reduced interstellar extinction in this band. SiO masers were used to align NIR images with radio observations, as they can be observed in both NIR and radio bands. The rapid motion of S2 (and other nearby stars) easily stood out against slower-moving stars along <b>the</b> <b>line-of-sight</b> so these could be subtracted from the images.|$|E
25|$|This {{method has}} two major disadvantages. First, {{planetary}} transits are observable {{only when the}} planet's orbit happens to be perfectly aligned from the astronomers' vantage point. The probability of a planetary orbital plane being directly on <b>the</b> <b>line-of-sight</b> to a star is {{the ratio of the}} diameter of the star to the diameter of the orbit (in small stars, the radius of the planet is also an important factor). About 10% of planets with small orbits have such an alignment, and the fraction decreases for planets with larger orbits. For a planet orbiting a Sun-sized star at 1 AU, the probability of a random alignment producing a transit is 0.47%. Therefore, the method cannot guarantee that any particular star is not a host to planets. However, by scanning large areas of the sky containing thousands or even hundreds of thousands of stars at once, transit surveys can find more extrasolar planets than the radial-velocity method. Several surveys have taken that approach, such as the ground-based MEarth Project, SuperWASP, KELT, and HATNet and the space-based COROT and Kepler missions. The transit method has also the advantage of detecting planets around stars that are located a few thousand light years away. The most distant planets detected by Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search are located near the galactic center. However, reliable follow-up observations of these stars are nearly impossible with current technology.|$|E

500|$|The radial {{velocity}} of Vega is the component of this star's motion along <b>the</b> <b>line-of-sight</b> to the Earth. Movement {{away from the}} Earth will cause the light from Vega to shift to a lower frequency (toward the red), or to a higher frequency (toward the blue) if the motion is toward the Earth.

Precise measurements of this redshift give a value of [...] The minus sign indicates a relative motion toward the Earth.|$|E

40|$|Abridged) We present {{maps for}} various Galactic longitudes and latitudes at 1. 4 GHz, {{which is the}} {{frequency}} where deep SKA surveys are proposed. The maps are about 1. 5 deg in size and have an angular resolution of about 1. 6 arcsec. We analyse the maps {{in terms of their}} probability density functions (PDFs) and structure functions. Total intensity emission is more smooth in the plane than at high latitudes due to the different contributions from the regular and random magnetic field. The high latitude fields show more extended polarized emission and RM structures than those in the plane, where patchy emission structures on very small scales dominate. The RM PDFs in the plane are close to Gaussians, but clearly deviate from that at high latitudes. The RM structure functions show smaller amplitudes and steeper slopes towards high latitudes. These results emerge from the fact that much more turbulent cells are passed through by <b>the</b> <b>line-of-sights</b> in <b>the</b> plane. Although the simulated random magnetic field components distribute in 3 D, the magnetic field spectrum extracted from the structure functions of RMs conforms to 2 D in the plane and approaches 3 D at high latitudes.

500|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, however, antiaircraft surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs) could threaten high-altitude aircraft, {{as demonstrated by}} the 1960 downing of Gary Powers' U-2. The USAF Strategic Air Command (SAC) was aware of these developments and had begun moving its bombers to low-level penetration even before the U-2 downing. This tactic greatly reduces radar detection distances through the use of terrain masking; using features of the terrain like hills and valleys, <b>the</b> <b>line-of-sight</b> from the radar to the bomber can be broken, rendering the radar (and human observers) incapable of seeing the target. Additionally, radars of the era were subject to [...] "clutter" [...] from stray returns from the ground and other objects, which meant a minimum angle existed above the horizon where they could detect a target. Bombers flying at low altitudes could remain under these angles simply by keeping their distance from the radar sites. This combination of effects made SAMs of the era ineffective against low-flying aircraft. The same effects also meant that low-flying aircraft were difficult to detect by higher-flying interceptors, since their radar systems could not readily pick out opposing aircraft against the clutter from ground reflections (lack of look-down/shoot-down capability).|$|E
