5|$|In 2013, Arsenal invited Galatasaray {{to compete}} at their annual Emirates Cup tournament. Some Arsenal fans reacted {{negatively}} to the news, claiming that there was still bad blood between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> supporters and were concerned {{that there would be}} a resumption of hostilities between them.|$|E
5|$|Iridescence, as {{explained}} by Thomas Young in 1803, is created when extremely thin films reflect {{part of the}} light falling on them from their top surfaces. The rest of the light goes through the films, and a further {{part of it is}} reflected from their bottom surfaces. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> reflected waves travel back upwards in the same direction. But since the bottom-reflected waves travelled a little further – controlled by the thickness and refractive index of the film, and the angle at which the light fell – <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> waves are out of phase. When the waves are one or more whole wavelength apart – in other words at certain specific angles, they add (interfere constructively), giving a strong reflection. At other angles and phase differences, they can subtract, giving weak reflections. The thin film therefore selectively reflects just one wavelength – a pure colour – at any given angle, but other wavelengths – different colours – at different angles. So, as a thin-film structure like a butterfly's wing or bird's feather moves, it seems to change colour.|$|E
5|$|The {{neutral zone}} {{that had been}} {{allocated}} to Belgian fans was largely occupied by Juventus supporters, {{many of whom were}} from the local Italian community. The neutral zone was in section Z, {{on the same side of}} the ground as the Liverpool fans. The two groups thus stood yards apart, separated only by chicken wire. At approximately 7p.m., missiles began to be thrown between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> fans; because the stadium was crumbling, fans could pick stones up and throw them across the divide.|$|E

50|$|Fabio Chigi granted eight reliquaries to {{the chapel}} in 1654 and in 1656, {{containing}} the bones <b>of</b> different saints. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> small crystal pyramids are preserved in the treasury of the basilica.

5000|$|During Roman times, Annaeus {{was near}} the Municipum of Semta (Africa) which lay on the {{opposite}} side of the Faida-Dzemda stream. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> ruins have been treated in modern times together [...] though <b>the</b> presence of <b>two</b> different bishops in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> settlements indicates separate entities during the Roman and Byzantine era.|$|R
5|$|The {{two small}} upper {{register}} panels show a rather traditional Annunciation scene, {{with the usual}} dove representing the Holy Spirit near Mary. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> panels, unlike those on the interior, are compositionally very different. The figures occupy distinctly separate niches and the colour schemes of the grisaille saints and donors contrast sharply.|$|E
5|$|Features at {{the park}} include a fountain, artworks, a cafe, and a {{distinctive}} glass canopy. Director Park was designed by Laurie Olin of the design firm OLIN, and the Portland-based architectural firm ZGF Architects. The park {{is part of what}} had originally been planned as a corridor of consecutive public parks stretching across downtown Portland. This plan included what are today the South Park Blocks and the North Park Blocks. Proposals to connect <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> park blocks arose in the 1970s, and in 1998 businessman Tom Moyer made a proposal for what became Director Park. Planning began in the mid-2000s, and construction began in 2008.|$|E
5|$|On April 26, 2011, Fox {{was drafted}} {{back to the}} SmackDown brand {{as part of the}} 2011 {{supplemental}} draft and in her first match back for the brand, acting as a villainess, she was defeated by Layla and suffered a shoulder injury. On the May 27 episode of SmackDown, in her return, Fox and Tamina Snuka defeated the team of Kaitlyn and AJ Lee, which later transitioned into a feud between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> Divas, with Fox and Tamina regularly winning tag team matches and allying with Rosa Mendes. The alliance between Fox and Tamina ended on the August 11 episode of WWE Superstars, when Fox defeated Tamina in a singles match.|$|E
50|$|The first inter-association {{football}} {{match between}} Sheffield FA and London (the FA) was played at Bramall lane. Sheffield won the match 3-1. Many such matches were played during the 1870s {{with the home}} side dictating which rules they should play under. This eventually led to a merger <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> rules in 1878.|$|R

5|$|The Edwardian {{sites have}} strong {{architectural}} links to castles and town walls {{built in the}} kingdom of Savoy in North Italy during the same period. The resemblance between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> buildings was first noted by historian Arnold Taylor in the 1950s. Similarities include the semi-circular door arches, window styles, corbelled towers, the positioning of putlog holes, tall circular towers and crenellations with pinnacles found in Edward's works in North Wales; in Savoy these can be seen in constructions such as the defences of Saillon, La Bâtiaz and Chillon Castles. Many of these similarities have been considered {{to be the result of}} the influence of the Savoy architect Master James of St George, employed by Edward I, and who brought other Savoyard architects with him to North Wales.|$|E
5|$|The chaos {{continued}} as other royal guards were found and beaten; {{at least one}} more was killed and his head too appeared atop a pike. Finally, the fury of the attack subsided enough to permit some communication between the former French Guards, who formed the professional core of Lafayette's National Guard militia, and the royal gardes du corps. The units had a history of cooperation and a military sense of mutual respect, and Lafayette, who had been snatching a few hours of sleep in his exhaustion, awoke {{to make the most of}} it. To the relief of the royals, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> soldiers were reconciled by his charismatic mediation and a tenuous peace was established within the palace.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{rooms were}} {{positioned}} {{on the first}} floor of a range of buildings that ran around the outside of the ward, facing onto a courtyard. The four towers that protected the Inner Ward contained service facilities, with the Chapel Tower containing the private royal chapel. Each tower has an additional watchtower turret, probably intended both for security and to allow the prominent display of the royal flag. The arrangement was originally similar to that of the 13th century Gloriette at Corfe Castle, and provided a combination of privacy for the king while providing extensive personal security. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> apartments were later unified into a single set of rooms, including a great chamber, outer chamber and inner chamber.|$|E
50|$|In 1928, New Zealand Government Railways {{obtained}} {{and operated}} three unusual Garratt locomotives in the 4-6-2 + 2-6-4 layout from Beyer, Peacock and Company of the United Kingdom. These engines had three cylinders (16.5 x 24 in) on each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> engine frames, thus creating a 6-cylinder Garratt. The engines entered service in 1929.|$|R

50|$|Quasiatoms are {{collections}} of atomic or sub-atomic particles that when undergoing a collision that briefly {{appear to have}} the same characteristics as a (larger) atom. This can occur when <b>the</b> nuclei <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> particles colliding become much closer to each other than they are to their constituent electrons. The combined nuclei then exhibit the same 1/r force as a single nucleus.|$|R
5|$|All runways {{have been}} resurfaced with concrete, a more durable {{material}} {{than the previous}} asphalt. In April 2016, 8L/26R became the last runway to be resurfaced. This runway is also the longest at McCarran and typically serves one-third of the airport's annual traffic. Parallel to it is runway 8R/26L, which opened in 1991. On {{the western side of}} the airport are runways 1L/19R and 1R/19L. 1L/19R was originally a short runway suited for light aircraft before it was significantly widened and lengthened in 1997. Between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> parallel runways was runway 14/32, which has been decommissioned. Runways 8L/26R and 8R/26L were previously 7L/25R and 7R/25L respectively. The runways were renumbered 8L/26R and 8R/26L in August 2017, following a geographical shift in the planet's magnetic poles by more than 3 degrees, the threshold for renumbering set by the FAA.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{qualified}} for the final by defeating French club Lens in their semi-final. Galatasaray beat English team Leeds United but their matches were marred by violence: two Leeds United fans were stabbed to death before their semi-final first leg at Galatasaray's Ali Sami Yen Stadium in Istanbul on 6 April 2000. The events happened at 22:00 in Istanbul's Taksim Square during a fight between Leeds fans and Galatasaray fans. Leeds fans had been drinking in bars reportedly taunting local people and Turkish police intervened to stop fights breaking out. There were reports that a Galatasaray fan had run to a telephone to call for support when he saw Leeds fans arriving. Galatasaray fans entered the area shortly afterwards which precipitated a fight between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> supporters. This led to the two Leeds fans being stabbed.|$|E
5|$|Flowers and coins, {{as well as}} stars, are {{scattered}} about the game's stages. These are totaled {{at the end of}} each stage and a score is given depending how many of each were collected (a maximum of 30 stars, 20 red coins and 5 flowers). Sufficiently high scores are required to unlock one of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> secret levels. (the other set being unlocked upon completing the game, similar to the GBA remake of the original game) Special character coins are also introduced. Missing from the game are the power-ups of sorts — like the ability to spit seeds by eating watermelons — which were present in the original. The fire breathing ability is retained though: Yoshi can use it when he snags a torch or fireball with his tongue. This allows him to shoot streams of fire up to three times. Keys found in the stages unlock mini-games and doors that would be closed otherwise.|$|E

5|$|Millwall's fiercest rival is West Ham United. It {{is one of}} {{the most}} passionately contested local derbies in football. The two clubs have rarely met in recent years due to them playing in {{different}} leagues; the majority of their meetings happened before the First World War, with some 60 meetings between 1899–1915. The clubs have played 99 times since the first contest in 1899. Millwall have won 38, drawn 27 and lost 34. Despite violence between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> supporters and calls for future games between the clubs to be played behind closed doors, they last met in the Football League Championship in 2011–12 with no outright ban on either set of fans, and no repeat of crowd trouble. The rivalry between the sides, specifically the clubs' two hooligan firms has been depicted on the big screen several times, in films such as Green Street.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} {{works by}} using energy-releasing chemical reactions to drive energy-requiring reactions: <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> reactions {{are said to}} be coupled. This means one cannot occur without the other. The flow of electrons through the electron transport chain, from electron donors such as NADH to electron acceptors such as oxygen, is an exergonic process– it releases energy, whereas the synthesis of ATP is an endergonic process, which requires an input of energy. Both the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane, and energy is transferred from electron transport chain to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane, in a process called chemiosmosis. In practice, this is like a simple electric circuit, with a current of protons being driven from the negative N-side of the membrane to the positive P-side by the proton-pumping enzymes of the electron transport chain. These enzymes are like a battery, as they perform work to drive current through the circuit. The movement of protons creates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, which is often called the proton-motive force. It has two components: a difference in proton concentration (a H+ gradient, ΔpH) and a difference in electric potential, with the N-side having a negative charge.|$|E
