40|$|This paper {{explores the}} defense {{repertoire}} of <b>tupelo</b> <b>leafminer,</b> Antispila nysaefoliella Clemens (Lepidoptera: Heliozelidae), {{and the role}} of natural selec-tion in shaping its suite of defenses against natural enemies. First, I discuss the context and conditions for the evolution of multiple defenses, which are cached {{within the framework of the}} generalized predation sequence, where all successful predators must achieve: detection, identification, approach, subjugation, and consumption of their prey. The obligatory nature of this sequence implies that prey are likely to evolve one or more defenses—in response to at least one, but more likely, multiple stages attack. This also implies that there may be tradeoffs with defense efficiency and effectiveness, both in a tactical and evolutionary sense, if prey also fall to the idiom of ‘‘jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none’’. Second, I present, as a case study, the defense repertoire of A. nysaefoliella (Lepidoptera: Heliozelidae). This species exhibits both passive and active forms of defense, which appears to function for different stages. Evidence also suggests that there are potential inefficiencies and costs to fecundity. Finally, I discuss the effects of a highly variable risk environment on prey evolution and the importance of increasing our resolution of predator–prey and host–parasitoid interactions...|$|E
40|$|Our study {{investigated}} the importance of variability in the parasitoid community {{as a source of}} selection on host group size using a field population of the <b>tupelo</b> <b>leafminer,</b> Antispila nysaefoliella Clemens, which specializes on tupelo, Nyssa sylvatica Marsh. Larvae were collected from leaves with variable numbers of larvae and screened for parasitism using polymerase chain reaction of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I using markers designed specifically for amplifying parasitoid DNA while excluding host DNA. This method of selective PCR was effective for detecting the presence and identifying species of immature stages of three hymenopteran superfamilies: Chalcidoidea, Ichneumonoidea and Platygastroidea, which represented 83. 4 %, 16. 0 % and 0. 6 % of the total detectable parasitism, respectively. Our resulting sequences were then calibrated with sequences from identified adult parasitoids that had been either reared or field-captured. A cluster analysis revealed 10 distinct clades that showed differences in attack patterns with respect to host traits and season. Total parasitism followed an inverse density-dependent or density-independent pattern with respect to host density (number per leaf). However, when parasitoid taxa were considered separately, one clade, which could be a cryptic species of Pnigalio maculipes Crawford (Chalcidoidea: Eulophidae), was found to increase its per leaf attack rate with host density. Our results suggest that parasitoid community composition and differences among species in their attack strategies can play a large role in determining the adaptive advantage of host grouping...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} two factors, leaf size and group size, on the {{performance}} of the <b>Tupelo</b> <b>leafminer,</b> Antispila nysaefoliella (Lepidoptera: Heliozelidae), were examined by fitting growth models to mine expansion data using nonlinear mixed-effects models. The rate of mine expansion served as a proxy for larval performance because of its correlation with both feeding activity and growth rate and is also the means by which a larva achieves its final mine size (or total consumption). Leaf size was used as a measure of resource availability, and was expected to reduce the impact of resource competition and enhance larval performance. In contrast to the unidirectional effects expected for leaf size (i. e. more resources should enhance performance), the direction for the effects of group size was expected to depend on the mechanism(s) driving the effect. For example, if there is resource competition among larvae in a group, then this could increase the feeding rates of some larvae or reduce the total consumption of others. However, if leaf mining induces host plant chemical defences, then larger groups might elicit a greater defensive response by the host plant (at the leaf), and hence, be characterized by reduced feeding and growth rates. To investigate these interactions, two growth models, the Gompertz model and {{a modified version of the}} von Bertalanffy growth equation, were fitted to time series of the sizes of individual leaf mines using nonlinear mixed-effects models. Linear and nonlinear associations of each factor (group size or leaf size) with model parameters were then evaluated using a hierarchical testing procedure by determining: (i) whether inclusion of the factor produced a better-fit model, and (ii) if it did, the form of that relationship (i. e. linear or nonlinear). Three patterns were detected with these analyses. (i) Leaf size had a significant positive, linear relationship with mine expansion rate. (ii) Group size had a significant quadratic relationship with mine expansion rate. (iii) The effects of leaf and group size on the maximum mine size were opposite to those found with growth rate...|$|E
