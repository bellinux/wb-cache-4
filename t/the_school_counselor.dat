He passes a sample of marijuana around the class so that the children can learn its smell, but it is never returned. As a result, Mackey is fired, and is later kicked out of his house, leaving him homeless. A desperate Mackey gives in to trying marijuana one night in an alley, and later, LSD. Soon enough, Mr. Mackey becomes a drug-addled hippie, and meets a female hippie, with whom he decides to get married. While on honeymoon in India, Mr. Mackey is captured and taken into rehab. Mr. Mackey emerges clean from rehab and is given his job back.|$|E

Kenny immolates himself and ultimately dies, leading to Stan, Kyle, and Cartman being grounded. Kenny is sent to Hell, where he is tormented by Satan and Saddam Hussein. Back on Earth, the parents of South Park organize a boycott against Canada and Terrance and Phillip, which is led by Kyle's mother, Sheila. Terrance and Phillip are arrested as war criminals. When the United States refuses to release the duo, Canada retaliates by bombing the residence of the Baldwin brothers.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> experienced collaboration with social services and whether they felt they have the ability to improve upon this collaboration. The empirical data consists of qualitative interviews with eight <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> from public <b>schools,</b> ages 13 to 15, in eight separate municipalities in the Stockholm area. The main results showed that <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> recognized <b>the</b> positive benefits from collaboration, but that they in practice experienced difficulties turning this into a high-quality collaboration. <b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> experienced that due to uncertain expectations in the collaboration it led to unclear distribution of areas of responsibilities. <b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> expressed small or no possibilities for them to improve upon collaboration but pointed out that higher commitment and a positive attitude are valuable attributes to improving collaboration. The results of the interviews were analyzed using the new institutional theory of organization and the role theoretic perspective. The conclusion states that <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> can help improve collaboration by taking initiative to better communication in order to clarify the collaborators expectations and conditions. The study highlights importance of <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> trying to overcome obstacles and difficulties presented by different conditions of different organizations. ...|$|R

25|$|Some {{high schools}} {{have one or}} more {{teachers}} experienced in offering counseling to college-bound eleventh and twelfth graders. They usually work {{in conjunction with the}} guidance department who assist students in planning their high school academic path. Counselors handle many students and schools and generally do not have a role of overseeing or managing a student's college applications. Advisors recommend that students get to know their school counselor. Counselors do not complete interviews, write essays, or arrange college visits. Parents often meet with <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> during the eleventh grade. Most counselors have responsibility for helping many students and, as a result, it is difficult for them to provide individual help to a particular student; one estimate was that the average ratio for all high schools of counselors to students was 460 to 1. Only about a quarter of public high schools have a counselor devoted to college counseling issues full-time, while almost three quarters of private schools have a dedicated college counselor. A report suggested that private school counselors have substantially more contact with university admissions staff than public school counselors.|$|E
