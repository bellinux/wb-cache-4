25|$|The 1st Aero Squadron of the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps {{received}} eight JN-2s at San Diego in July 1915. The squadron {{was transferred}} to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in August {{to work with the}} Field Artillery School, during which one JN-2 crashed, resulting in a fatality. The pilots of the squadron met with its commander, Capt. Benjamin Foulois, <b>to</b> <b>advise</b> <b>that</b> the JN-2 was unsafe because of low power, shoddy construction, lack of stability, and overly sensitive rudder. Foulois and his executive officer Capt. Thomas D. Milling disagreed, and flights continued until a second JN-2 crashed in early September, resulting in the grounding of the six remaining JN-2s until mid-October. When two new JN-3s were delivered, the grounded aircraft were then upgraded in accordance with the new design. In March 1916, these eight JN-3s were deployed to Mexico for aerial observation during the Pancho Villa Expedition of 1916–1917.|$|E

25|$|Inside Candlestick Park, {{fewer than}} half of the more than 62,000 fans had reached their seats {{by the time of the}} quake, and the load on the {{structure}} of the stadium was lower than maximum. There had also been a seismic-strengthening project previously completed on the upper deck concrete windscreen that may have prevented large numbers of injuries in the event of serious damage or even a catastrophic collapse. Fans reported that the stadium moved in an articulated manner as the earthquake wave passed through it, that the light standards swayed by many feet, and that the concrete upper deck windscreen moved in a wave-like manner over a distance of several feet. When electrical power to the stadium was lost, someone drove a police car onto the field, where an officer used the car's public address system <b>to</b> <b>advise</b> <b>that</b> the game had been postponed. After the shaking subsided, many of the players on both teams immediately searched for, and gathered, family and friends from the stands before evacuating the facility.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century, Phineas Taylor (P.T.) Barnum {{introduces}} his circus acts as he stands in front of a tent, proclaiming [...] "There Is a Sucker Born Ev'ry Minute". He loves spectacle and excitement, using hype and [...] "humbug" [...] to promote his exhibits. His wife Charity disagrees with his use of [...] "humbug" [...] but loves him and aims to keep him grounded. Barnum then introduces the oldest woman alive, Joice Heth, and thanks to some Barnum humbug she becomes a success ("Thank God I'm Old"). His wife Charity ("Chairy") urges him to get a job in a factory, but Barnum refuses ("The Colors of My Life [...] ") and Charity wryly admits and accepts the disparity between their views ("The Colors of My Life [...] "). Barnum enlists clowns to help in building a museum to house his attractions (with expected comical results) and it's up to Charity to encourage him to keep going ("One Brick at a Time"), with the result that [...] "everything about [...] museum was spectacular" [...] ("Museum Song"); however, the museum burns down accidentally. Barnum finds two new star attractions, Tom Thumb, who appears <b>to</b> <b>advise</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Bigger Isn't Better", and Jumbo the elephant. Barnum then becomes manager of the famous Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind ("Love Makes Such Fools of Us All"). Barnum becomes enamored of her and sees the attraction of going on tour with her ("Out There"). He accompanies Jenny on tour, leaving Charity behind, as a marching band greets them ("Come Follow the Band"). Although all seems to be going well for Barnum, he finds that without Charity in his life he is miserable, and he decides to break ties with Jenny and return home to the woman he loves ("Love Makes Such Fools of Us All [...] "). Upon his return to Charity, he promises to live the more sedate life she desires for him, in [...] "Black and White." [...] After a failed stint running a clockworks factory and a failed attempt to build his own city, he turns to politics; when his campaign looks doomed to fail due to lack of interest, Charity realizes how important his talents and passion are in his life and allows him to inject color and life into his campaign. He is elected Mayor of Bridgeport, {{and the two of them}} recognize the value in each other's approach to life and how they complement one another ("The Colors of My Life [...] "). Barnum is prepared to run for President, but his beloved Charity dies suddenly, leaving Barnum bereft and alone. When Barnum finds himself cheated of the Presidential nomination by his political party, he laments his position, realizes that his talent for Humbug will never leave him and wishes to [...] "make it right, shoot a rocket, shine a light" [...] ("Prince of Humbug"). James Anthony Bailey arrives and offers him the chance to [...] "Join the Circus". Initially resisting, he relents (thanks in part to Charity's two-headed coin, which she has used to humbug him throughout the show) and joins Bailey, and they form the famous circus Barnum and Bailey.|$|E

Lady Lufton, if he had anything further to say of that kind, would listen to him as a matter of course. She would listen to him and reply to him without temper. But she did not approve of it. She told herself silently that she could not approve of persecution or of interference. She therefore drew herself up, and pursed her mouth, and put on something of that look of severity which she could assume very visibly, if it so pleased her.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have yet}} to record, he writes (July 1896) in the {{fragment}} [...] already more than once mentioned, an undoubted error, the most [...] singular and palpable, I may add the least excusable of them all, [...] especially since it was committed so late as in the year 1862, [...] when I had outlived half a century. In the autumn of that year, [...] and in a speech delivered after a public dinner at [...] Newcastle-upon-Tyne, I declared {{in the heat of}} the American [...] struggle that Jefferson Davis had made a nation, that is to say, [...] that the division of the American Republic by the establishment of [...] a Southern or secession state was an accomplished fact. Strange to [...] say, this declaration, most unwarrantable to be made by a minister [...] of the crown with no authority other than his own, was not due to [...] any feeling of partizanship for the South or hostility to the [...] North. The fortunes of the South were at their zenith. Many who [...] wished well to the Northern cause despaired of its success. The [...] friends of the North in England were beginning <b>to</b> <b>advise</b> <b>that</b> it [...] should give way, for the avoidance of further bloodshed and [...] greater calamity. I weakly supposed that the time had come when [...] respectful suggestions of this kind, founded on the necessity of [...] the case, were required by a spirit of that friendship which, in [...] so many contingencies of life, has to offer sound recommendations [...] with a knowledge that they will not be popular. Not only was this [...] a misjudgment of the case, but even if it had been otherwise, I [...] was not the person to make the declaration. I really, though most [...] strangely, believed that it was an act of friendliness to all [...] America to recognise that the struggle was virtually at an end. I [...] was not one of those who on the ground of British interests [...] desired a division of the American Union. My view was distinctly [...] opposite. I thought that while the Union continued it never could [...] exercise any dangerous pressure upon Canada to estrange it from [...] the empire—our honour, as I thought, rather than our interest [...] forbidding its surrender. But were the Union split, the North, no [...] longer checked by the jealousies of slave-power, would seek a [...] partial compensation for its loss in annexing, or trying to annex, [...] British North America. Lord Palmerston desired the severance as a [...] diminution of a dangerous power, but prudently held his tongue.|$|E
