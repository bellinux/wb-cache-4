Tariff adjustments had been proposed {{for at least six}} years, but had never been implemented. The increase came following a significant drop in oil prices. The Ministry of Water says that the majority of households would not be significantly affected by the increase, because their consumption remains within the lower consumption blocks. Commercial, industrial and government users are charged according to different, higher tariff schedules.|$|E
25|$|In February 1832 Henry Clay, {{back in the}} Senate after a {{two decades}} absence, made a three-day-long speech calling for a new <b>tariff</b> <b>schedule</b> and an {{expansion}} of his American System. In an effort {{to reach out to}} John Calhoun and other southerners, Clay’s proposal provided for a ten million dollar revenue reduction based on the amount of budget surplus he anticipated for the coming year. Significant protection was still part of the plan as the reduction primarily came on those imports not in competition with domestic producers. Jackson proposed an alternative that reduced overall tariffs to 28%. John Quincy Adams, now in the House of Representatives, used his Committee of Manufacturers to produce a compromise bill that, in its final form, reduced revenues by five million dollars, lowered duties on non-competitive products, and retained high tariffs on woolens, iron, and cotton products. In the course of the political maneuvering, George McDuffie’s Ways and Means Committee, the normal originator of such bills, prepared a bill with drastic reduction across the board. McDuffie’s bill went nowhere. Jackson signed the Tariff of 1832 on July 14, 1832, a few days after he vetoed the Bank of the United States re-charter bill. Congress adjourned after it failed to override Jackson’s veto.|$|E

40|$|Some recent {{empirical}} researches on the {{tariff structure}} of industrial countries have again drawn {{the attention to}} the problem of the empirical relevance of the Heckscher-Ohlin theory of trade and - incidentally - to the related question of the legitimacy of the discrimination charge levelled by the “third world” against the <b>tariff</b> <b>schedules</b> of the developed countries. Two studies in particular have argued that the relationship between labour intensity and protection is not definite. The present paper shows that these findings are based on the use of an inadequate definition of the factor-proportions concept. A correct identification of labor-intensive and capital-intensive manufacturers leads to fully different conclusions, which do not require the rejection of the factor-proportions theory of trade and show that the <b>tariff</b> <b>schedules</b> of some industrial countries are clearly biased against imports of manufacturers from developing countries.

40|$|International {{agreements}} {{are an important}} element of the world economic system, but ques-tions remain as to why they are necessary. In trade theory, the terms-of-trade hypothesis posits that countries use tariffs in part to improve their terms of trade and that trade agreements cause them to internalize the costs that such terms-of-trade shifts impose on other countries. As yet, however, the hypothesis is largely untested on the most-favored-nation (MFN) <b>tariff</b> <b>schedules</b> of the vast majority of WTO members, which cover the bulk of world trade. This paper investigates whether MFN tariffs set by existing WTO members in the Uruguay round are consistent with the terms-of-trade hypothesis. We present a model of multilateral trade negotiations featur-ing endogenous participation that leads the resulting <b>tariff</b> <b>schedules</b> to display terms-of-trade effects. Specifically, the model predicts that the level of the importer’s tariff resulting from negotiations should be negatively related to the product of exporter concentration, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (sum of squared export shares), and the importer’s market power, as measured by the inverse elasticity of export supply, on a product-by-product basis. We test this hypothesis using data on tariffs, trade and production across more than 30 WTO countries and find strong support. We estimate that the internalization of terms of trade effects through WTO negotiations has lowered the average tariff of these countries by 22 to 27 percent compared to its non-cooperative level...|$|R
