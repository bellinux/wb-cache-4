5|$|A {{midazolam}} overdose {{is considered}} a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used {{within an hour of}} the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E
5|$|Other {{compounds}} {{of barium}} find only niche applications, {{limited by the}} <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> Ba2+ ions (barium carbonate is a rat poison), {{which is not a}} problem for the insoluble BaSO4.|$|E
5|$|Soluble {{dysprosium}} salts, such as dysprosium chloride and dysprosium nitrate, are mildly toxic when ingested. Based on the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> dysprosium chloride to mice, it {{is estimated}} that the ingestion of 500grams or more could be fatal to a human. The insoluble salts, however, are non-toxic.|$|E
40|$|Imatinib, sunitinib, and {{sorafenib}} {{have been}} promoted as targeted drugs lacking the usual <b>toxicities</b> <b>of</b> chemotherapy. During the past year, however, the list <b>of</b> unexpected <b>toxicities</b> <b>of</b> targeted therapies has grown. The study by Desai and colleagues {{in this issue}} adds primary hypothyroidism induced by sunitinib to the list...|$|R
40|$|Protocol to {{determine}} <b>toxicities</b> <b>of</b> chemicals implemented relatively cheaply {{by use of}} equipment and materials packaged in convenient kit form. Tests involve observation of macroscopic patterns formed at high concentrations of free-swimming protozoan species Tetrahymena pyriformis in liquid media. Provides more-sensitive indication <b>of</b> <b>toxicity</b> and costs less. Given {{that there are no}} data on <b>toxicities</b> <b>of</b> 70 to 80 percent of commercial chemicals, high cost of, and current opposition to, testing on higher animals, new protocol helps meet pressing need...|$|R
50|$|Dose {{reductions}} {{were required}} in 50% {{of the patients}} studied in RCC in order to manage the significant <b>toxicities</b> <b>of</b> this agent.|$|R
5|$|Some {{drawbacks}} {{of using}} organoiodine compounds {{as compared to}} organochlorine or organobromine compounds is the greater expense and <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> the iodine derivatives, since iodine is expensive and organoiodine compounds are stronger alkylating agents. For example, iodoacetamide and iodoacetic acid denature proteins by irreversibly alkylating cysteine residues and preventing the reformation of disulfide linkages.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium and {{tellurium}} compounds {{are considered}} to be mildly toxic and need to be handled with care, although acute poisoning is rare. Tellurium poisoning is particularly difficult to treat as many chelation agents used in the treatment of metal poisoning will increase the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> tellurium. Tellurium is not reported to be carcinogenic.|$|E
5|$|The {{commercial}} use of beryllium requires {{the use of}} appropriate dust control equipment and industrial controls at all times because of the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> inhaled beryllium-containing dusts that can cause a chronic life-threatening allergic disease in some people called berylliosis.|$|E
50|$|There are {{different}} types <b>of</b> <b>toxicity.</b> The types <b>of</b> <b>toxicity</b> {{that have been}} studied for citrinin are acute toxicity, nephrotoxicity, genotoxicity and its carcinogenicity.|$|R
50|$|The major <b>toxicities</b> <b>of</b> {{approved}} IMiDs are peripheral neuropathy, thrombocytopenia, anaemia and venous thromboembolism. There may be {{an increased}} risk of secondary malignancies, especially acute myeloid leukaemia in those receiving IMiDs.|$|R

5|$|The high <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> Cr(VI) compounds, {{used in the}} {{established}} chromium electroplating process, and the strengthening of safety and environmental regulations demand a search for substitutes for chromium {{or at least a}} change to less toxic chromium(III) compounds.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> iridium {{compounds}} because they are used in very small amounts, but soluble salts, such as the iridium halides, could be hazardous due to elements other than iridium or due to iridium itself. However, most iridium compounds are insoluble, which makes absorption into the body difficult.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>toxicity</b> studies <b>of</b> {{the plant}} have {{received}} controversial results.

[...] In addition to that, the <b>toxicities</b> <b>of</b> the plant seem to vary from one cultivar to another and are dose dependent. [...] This is probably attributed from the content level of pulegone.|$|R

40|$|The chiral {{xenobiotics}} {{are very}} dangerous {{for all of}} us due to the different enantioselective <b>toxicities</b> <b>of</b> the enantiomers. Besides, these have different enantioselective bioaccumulations and behaviors in our body and other organisms. It is of urgent need to understand the enantioselective bioaccumulations, toxicities, and the health hazards of the chiral xenobiotics. The present article describes the classification, sources of contamination, distribution, enantioselective bioaccumulation, and the <b>toxicities</b> <b>of</b> the chiral xenobiotics. Besides, the efforts are also made to discuss the prevention and remedial measures of the havoc of the chiral xenobiotics. The challenges of the chiral xenobiotics have also been highlighted. Finally, future prospectives are also discussed...|$|R
5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges. It {{is often said}} that sponges produce {{chemical}} defenses against such predators. However an experiment showed {{that there is no}} relationship between the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> chemicals produced by sponges and how they taste to fish, which would diminish the usefulness of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish may even help to spread sponges by detaching fragments.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk of}} developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.|$|E
5|$|An {{increase}} in criticism and the considerable <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> the meat {{appears to be}} achieving the opposite. During the first hunt {{of the season in}} Taiji in 2009, an estimated 50 Pilot Whales and 100 Bottlenose Dolphins were captured. Although all the Pilot Whales were killed, and 30 Bottlenose Dolphins were taken for use in dolphinariums, the 70 remaining animals were set free again instead of being killed for consumption.|$|E

5|$|At these sites, {{the study}} also found averages of 1.7, 2.23, and 5.56 parts per million of aluminum, respectively. Concentrations of {{aluminium}} higher than 100 to 200 parts per million can cause suffocation of fish by accumulating in their gills. The <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> aluminum to fish is increased by a water pH of below 4.5 to 6.5. There were also 0.65, 0.81, and 1.84 parts per million of iron in these sites, and 0.96, 1.15, 0.03, and 2.65 parts per million of manganese. There were 91.37, 114.27, and 274.1 milligrams per liter of sulfates {{in the waters of}} Nescopeck at these sites.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> mercury, both the mining of {{cinnabar}} and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning. In China, prison labor was used by a private mining company {{as recently as the}} 1950s to develop new cinnabar mines. Thousands of prisoners were used by the Luo Xi mining company to establish new tunnels. Worker health in functioning mines is at high risk.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{compounds}} {{account for}} about half the production of bismuth. They are used in cosmetics, pigments, and a few pharmaceuticals, notably bismuth subsalicylate, used to treat diarrhea. Bismuth's unusual propensity to expand upon freezing is responsible for some of its uses, such as in casting of printing type. Bismuth has unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal. As the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> lead has become more apparent in recent years, there is an increasing use of bismuth alloys (presently {{about a third of}} bismuth production) as a replacement for lead.|$|E
50|$|One <b>of</b> {{the unique}} <b>toxicities</b> <b>of</b> {{cytarabine}} is cerebellar toxicity when given in high doses, which {{may lead to}} ataxia.

5|$|Experimental mercury vapor {{turbines}} {{were installed}} {{to increase the}} efficiency of fossil-fuel electrical power plants. The South Meadow power plant in Hartford, CT employed mercury as its working fluid, in a binary configuration with a secondary water circuit, {{for a number of years}} starting in the late 1920s in a drive to improve plant efficiency. Several other plants were built, including the Schiller Station in Portsmouth, NH, which went online in 1950. The idea did not catch on industry-wide due to the weight and <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> mercury, as well as the advent of supercritical steam plants in later years.|$|E

5|$|In addition, the {{vaporizing}} {{metal and}} flux materials expose welders to dangerous gases and particulate matter. The smoke produced contains particles {{of various types}} of oxides. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. Additionally, gases like carbon dioxide and ozone can form, which can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate. Some of the latest welding masks are fitted with an electric powered fan to help disperse harmful fumes.|$|E
