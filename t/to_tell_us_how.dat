[...] " [...] and panting duet partner Drake steam the {{recording}} studio windows as he raps a helpless play-by-play". Bill Lamb from About.com gave the song a positive review, saying that [...] "There it is, the chorus opens the track with [...] "Oh na na...what's my name?" [...] and the hook is firmly implanted. It's not long before Drake's added on rap kicks in with clever, sexy and romantic rhyming. Then the dreamy drum machine rhythms and Rihanna's vocals kick in again. This is a hit... "What's My Name?" [...] is a good addition to that romantic evening playlist." [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV praised the [...] "song's chorus" [...] and [...] "Drake's verse". Molly Lambert of Pitchfork Media praised Rihanna's performance saying that [...] "On 'What's My Name', Rihanna doesn't have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> desirable she is – it is a given.

500|$|The coast offered Percy Shelley and Edward Williams {{the chance}} to enjoy their [...] "perfect plaything for the summer", a new sailing boat. The boat had been {{designed}} by Daniel Roberts and Edward Trelawny, an admirer of Byron's who had joined the party in January 1822. On 1 July 1822, Percy Shelley, Edward Ellerker Williams, and Captain Daniel Roberts sailed south down the coast to Livorno. There Percy Shelley discussed with Byron and Leigh Hunt the launch of a radical magazine called The Liberal. On 8 July, he and Edward Williams {{set out on the}} return journey to Lerici with their eighteen-year-old boatboy, Charles Vivian. They never reached their destination. A letter arrived at Villa Magni from Hunt to Percy Shelley, dated 8 July, saying, [...] "pray write <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> you got home, for they say you had bad weather after you sailed monday & we are anxious". [...] "The paper fell from me," [...] Mary told a friend later. [...] "I trembled all over." [...] She and Jane Williams rushed desperately to Livorno and then to Pisa in the fading hope that their husbands were still alive. Ten days after the storm, three bodies washed up on the coast near Viareggio, midway between Livorno and Lerici. Trelawny, Byron, and Hunt cremated Percy Shelley’s corpse on the beach at Viareggio.|$|E

40|$|Yasser Arafat was a {{key figure}} in the {{political}} life of the late 20 th and early 21 st centuries. As Palestinian president, he was a central player in negotiations over the most contentious issue of the time: Middle East peace. But although his significance is unquestioned, his status is ambiguous: for some he was a freedom fighter, for others a terrorist. It is interesting, therefore, to observe the ways in which different world governments marked the death of Arafat in November 2004, in their official condolence messages. Using the tools of critical discourse analysis (CDA) and systemic functional linguistics (SFL), this article treats the diplomatic condolence message as a recognizable text type that has much <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> about <b>how</b> governments signal and construct ideological positions and in doing so `enact' the international community.

I will rely more on history than on speculation, for our actual experience in advancing the field has much <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> about <b>how</b> we can continue and accelerate that advance. Many of my examples will be drawn from work with which I have been associated, for I can speak with greater confidence about what motivated that work and its methods (and about its defects) than I can about the work of others.
