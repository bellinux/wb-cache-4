25|$|The design, using {{identical}} 6,200 horsepower (4,600kW) power cars at {{each end}} which operate on a voltage of 11,000 volts AC, and either 25 or 60 Hz frequency, derives several components from the TGV, such as the third-generation TGV's traction system (including the four asynchronous AC motors per power car, rectifiers, inverters, and regenerative braking), the trucks/bogies structure (a long wheelbase dual transom H frame welded steel with outboard mounted <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> bearings), the brake discs (although {{there are only three}} per axle, versus four on the TGV), and crash energy management techniques to control structural deformation {{in the event of an}} accident.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tapered</b> <b>roller</b> {{bearings}} use conical rollers {{that run}} on conical races. Most roller bearings only take radial or axial loads, but <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> bearings support both radial and axial loads, and generally can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. <b>Tapered</b> <b>roller</b> bearings are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> bearings are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy loads the <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the roller in the bearing adds to bearing friction compared to ball bearings.|$|E

50|$|Control of the 12-15 cwt {{model was}} by a bar-type {{accelerator}} pedal, which controlled {{the operation of}} several electro-magnetic contactors.

The transmission between the motor and the rear axle was by a shaft fitted with two Hardy Spicer universal joints. The brakes were manufactured by the Bendix Corporation, and both the foot and hand brakes operated on all four wheels. Although all models seemed to be classified as 12-15 cwt, the standard design had a load platform which was 8 ft long, while short chassis and long chassis variants were also produced, with platforms of 7.25 ft and 9 ft.|$|R

40|$|The {{main reason}} for such {{performance}} is the philosophy of six sigma, which are very much incorporated in the roots and culture of bearing manufacturing.

Through Six Sigma, a customer is better able to access the products and services they need, when they are needed, enjoy a significantly higher level of product and service utility, and pay less to receive such benefits.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} jerk signal, a signal obtained from differentiation of the acceleration signal with respect to time, for detecting the early damage of a bearing and bad lubrication conditions. The use of jerk signal is expected to result more sensitive detection than that obtain using acceleration signal. To prove this hypothesis, this paper shows the results of vibration measurement for needle bearings and <b>taper</b> <b>roller</b> bearings with variation of load level, types of bearing damage, and lubrication condition. Comparisons of acceleration and jerk signals are performed in both time domain, by comparing their RMS values, {{as well as in}} frequency domain, by comparing their spectrums. The results of the experiment show that the use of jerk signal can give a more sensitive result in detecting bearing damage than that produced using acceleration signal. Moreover, the use of jerk signal can lead to better results in detecting bad lubrication of rolling bearing than that obtain using Crest Factor (CF) value...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{cylindrical}} roller planetary traction drive was developed. It comprises a sun roller, three planetary rollers, an outer ring, a stationary carrier and an input shaft. The sun roller is hollow, and is connected through three logarithmic spiral profiles to the input shaft. As the input shaft rotates {{relative to the}} sun roller, a wedging action takes place between the input shaft and the sun roller; this makes the sun roller generate {{a certain amount of}} elastic deformation, so an appreciable amount of contact load is generated between the sun roller and the planetary roller. The greater the input torque is, the stronger the strength of the wedging action and the greater the contact load, and vice versa; so this configuration is self-actuating. Here, as {{cylindrical roller}}s are used in the planetary traction-drive configuration, the spin motion as would present in the case that the <b>tapered</b> <b>rollers</b> were used will not occur. Meanwhile, as a logarithmic spiral is used in the profile connection, the distribution of contact stress between the two connected surfaces will be uniform. This reduces the concentration of contact stress of the connected surfaces, and prolongs the life of the contact fatigue of the contacting surfaces...|$|R
25|$|A heated {{cylindrical}} billet workpiece is fed {{between two}} convex-tapered rollers, which are rotating {{in the same}} direction. The rollers are usually 6° askew from parallel with the billet's axis. The rollers are {{on opposite sides of}} the billet, and the surface of their largest cross sections are separated by a distance slightly smaller than the outside diameter (OD) of the original billet. The load imparted by the rollers compresses the material and the 6° skew provides both rotation and translation to the billet. The friction between the rollers and the billet is intentionally high, and is sometimes increased by using knurled rollers. This friction establishes stresses varying radially through the billet, with the highest stresses at the OD and the central axis. The stress exceeds the yield strength of the billet and causes circumferential fissures to propagate at various radii near the OD, and a central longitudinal void to form at the axis. A tapered mandrel is set inside and a short distance from the start of the central void. This mandrel forces the material outward and compresses the material against the back side of the <b>tapered</b> <b>rollers.</b> This compressive loading fuses the circumferential fissures and sets the initial internal diameter and OD values. The formed tube is then cooled and can be cold worked to refine the diameters and to achieve the desired yield strengths.|$|R

Design programs are available which size the single transverse curvature roller designs for a series of roller slopes and load separations and which design the compound roller bearings for a series of slopes and transverse radii of curvature.
