5|$|The third {{series of}} Cold Feet (2000) was {{extended}} {{from six to}} eight episodes by ITV. Bullen believed that the production team had covered all potential storylines {{in the first two}} series, so declined to write any more episodes. A team of five writers was hired by Granada Television, overseen by Bullen as a co-executive producer. Four out of the five writers left the team due to their scripts not being appropriate for the series, leaving only David Nicholls on staff. The writing process had made Bullen <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> about not writing and he began thinking about further storylines, such as mid-life crises and IVF. The same year, he signed a two-year contract with Granada to develop new projects. A fourth series of Cold Feet, also of eight episodes, was commissioned for 2001. Bullen announced {{that he did not want}} to write a fifth series, and that the fourth would be the last. His reasons were that with ITV's proposed commission of up to 20 episodes a year, the series would become like a soap opera. The popularity of the fourth series persuaded Bullen to write four more episodes that formed the fifth series in 2003. The fifth series won Bullen the Writer of the Year Award at the 2003 British Comedy Awards.|$|E

25|$|In the {{scenario}} favoured by David Erdal and Andrew Whiten, primate-style dominance provoked equal and opposite coalitionary resistance— counter-dominance. During {{the course of}} human evolution, increasingly effective strategies of rebellion against dominant individuals led to a compromise. While abandoning any attempt to dominate others, group members vigorously asserted their personal autonomy, maintaining their alliances to make potentially dominant individuals <b>think</b> <b>twice.</b> Within increasingly stable coalitions, according to this perspective, status began to be earned in novel ways, social rewards accruing to those perceived by their peers as especially cooperative and self-aware.|$|E
25|$|Upon his {{returning}} to Sarawak, the rebellion against Brunei's rule {{was still in}} progress. He managed to completely suppress the rebellion and pardoned the rebels for joining his side, providing positions in some administrative authority while limiting their power. Despite the initial refusal of Hashim to pardon them and wanting to execute all the rebels, Hashim was convinced by Brooke to forgive them as {{he had taken the}} major part in their suppression. In exchange for Brooke's continuous support towards the Sultanate and rental payment of £500, he was awarded the Kuching area from the Sultanate of Brunei; which later became Sarawak First Division. Hashim, however, began to <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> about giving the territory to Brooke, a doubt fanned by Mahkota who had been deprived of his power in the area in favour of Brooke. This led Hashim to constantly delay the recognition of concession and angered Brooke. On 24 September 1841, Brooke, with Royalist fully armed, went ashore to Hashim's audience chamber and called on him to negotiate. With little choice, and putting the blame mainly on Mahkota, Hashim proclaimed Brooke as the Rajah. Brooke issued new laws for the territory banning slavery, headhunting and piracy; and by July 1842, his appointment was confirmed by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II.|$|E

No such person exists, or if he does he's living on some island so remote that no word of the market will ever reach him." ...|$|R

500|$|Author Matthew Chojnacki {{recommended}} {{the film in}} his book Alternative Movie Posters: Film Art From the Underground.

500|$|Advocates {{also believe}} that {{destroying}} ivory can influence the supply side of the ivory market by sending a strong, highly visible and well-publicized message that the ivory market is dangerous and futile.

500|$|Dylan has {{continued}} to perform songs from his gospel albums in concert, occasionally covering traditional religious songs.

"Walk Away" [...] is a pop-dance and {{freestyle}} song co-written by Alanis Morissette, Leslie Howe, Louise Reny and Frank Levin, {{and produced}} by Howe for Morissette's debut album, Alanis (1991).

500|$|Dylan's contemporaries {{hailed the}} song as a masterpiece: Bob Spitz quotes Paul Stookey saying [...] "I {{thought it was}} a masterful statement", while Dave Van Ronk called it [...] "self-pitying but brilliant". Dylan biographer Howard Sounes commented: [...] "The greatness of the song was in the cleverness of the language. The phrase [...] "don't <b>think</b> <b>twice,</b> it's all right" [...] could be snarled, sung with resignation, or {{delivered}} with an ambiguous mixture of bitterness and regret. Seldom have the contradictory emotions of a thwarted lover been so well expressed, and the song transcended the autobiographical origins of Dylan's pain." ...|$|E
500|$|Dylan's {{first serious}} {{relationship}} was with artist Suze Rotolo, {{a daughter of}} American Communist Party radicals.

[...] Rotolo was photographed arm-in-arm with Dylan {{on the cover of}} his album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. Critics have connected Rotolo to some of Dylan's early love songs, including [...] "Don't <b>Think</b> <b>Twice</b> It's All Right". The relationship ended in 1964. In 2008, Rotolo published a memoir about her life in Greenwich Village and relationship with Dylan in the 1960s, A Freewheelin' Time.|$|E

Especially {{if you live in a}} city, it just becomes this commonplace thing, nobody <b>thinks</b> <b>twice</b> about it anymore. Even though there's so much awful stuff going on in the world, and horrible things that happen to people, it's kind of like 'out of sight, out of mind.' It's just kind of a sad thing. So it's kind of a commentary on that. It also works on a couple levels. It can be taken as the Greek mythology example with the Sirens that lure sailors in with their singing, so being on the receiving end of those sirens isn't a great thing. It works both ways." ...|$|R

He likes to make money and spend it, too. In other words, he is wasteful. There are also ugly rumors about him. From the standard criticism about being an ignorant rich man, to accusations that he used to be a criminal and a gangster, to claims that he spends thousands of dollars a night on drinking, that he slept with every model in town, and even that he killed his own wife.
