5|$|The web series {{begins as}} Jake Fischer arrives in Bright Falls to {{interview}} Dr. Hartman {{on his new}} book, an assignment from his publication agency. After a series of encounters with local townspeople, Jake soon finds himself the victim of long periods of lost time and black outs. He finds himself {{waking up in the}} middle of a forest and other locations where he had not been previously. He also develops an aversion towards lights and daytime. <b>The</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> stays in Bright Falls, the more violent his behaviour becomes. When he realises this, he tries to duct-tape himself to a refrigerator and recording videotape himself in his sleep to see what might be causing the behaviour. It is implied that he is being completely taken over by the Dark Presence, to the point of murdering several people. He then vanishes, just before the arrival of Alan and Alice Wake.|$|E
25|$|As {{opposed to}} his {{original}} counterpart, Disney {{gave him a}} more primal nature to his personality and mannerisms, which truly exploited his character as an untamed animal (i.e. alternating between walking and crawling, animal growls). Producer Don Hahn envisioned that the Beast's psychological state has become increasing feral <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> was under the curse, such that he would eventually lose his last vestiges of humanity and become completely wild if the spell could not be broken. Hahn's idea doesn't manifest prominently in the finished 1991 animated film, since the Beast is only seen in a brief scene some time after his transformation {{while much of the}} narrative starts during the later period of the curse.|$|E
500|$|For much of January and February 1908 Formby {{appeared}} in various London music halls {{for which he}} received £20 a week. The following year, and staying in the capital, he played three halls a night in exchange for £45 a week. One such venue was the Tivoli with Lloyd and Little Tich as the headline acts. When not performing in London, Formby continued to tour the provincial music halls. In 1910 he again appeared at the Tivoli, and was reviewed in The Times, in which the reporter opined that Formby [...] "becomes more of an artist <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> sings". Later that year Formby recorded what would become his most famous song, [...] "Standing at the Corner of the Street", which he also co-wrote. By 1913 his record sales were strong {{enough for him to}} negotiate a new recording contract worth £300 a year.|$|E
5000|$|The Seattle Mariners signed Beltré as a {{free agent}} before the 2005 season to a five-year, $64 million deal. [...] Regressing to his pre-2004 form, he batted just [...]255 with 19 home runs and 87 RBI. Manager Mike Hargrove did not give up hope on Beltré, saying, [...] "I think it's a season that, personally, he's {{disappointed}} in. I think it was a year that he will improve on <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he's</b> here and <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he's</b> in <b>the</b> American League." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] replied Ralph, and not {{to detain}} <b>the</b> gentleman <b>longer,</b> <b>he</b> bowed himself out, well pleased over the sudden turn his {{fortunes}} had taken.|$|R
50|$|Houser was {{selected}} by the New Orleans Saints in the seventh round (228th overall) of the 2000 NFL Draft. As of June 2009, no current player had been with <b>the</b> Saints <b>longer.</b> <b>He</b> was <b>the</b> starting long-snapper and a contributor on punt coverages.|$|R
500|$|In Striggio's 1607 libretto, Orfeo's act 5 soliloquy is interrupted, not by Apollo's {{appearance}} but by {{a chorus}} of maenads or Bacchantes—wild, drunken women—who sing of the [...] "divine fury" [...] of their master, the god Bacchus. The cause of their wrath is Orfeo and his renunciation of women; he will not escape their heavenly anger, and <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> evades them the more severe his fate will be. Orfeo leaves the scene and his destiny is left uncertain, as the Bacchantes devote themselves {{for the rest of}} the opera to wild singing and dancing in praise of Bacchus. The early music authority Claude Palisca believes that the two endings are not incompatible; Orfeo might evade the fury of the Bacchantes and be rescued by Apollo. However, this alternative ending in any case nearer to original classic myth, where the Bacchantes also appear, but it is made explicit that they torture him to his death, followed by reunion as a shade with Euridice but no apotheosis nor any interaction with Apollo.|$|E
500|$|California {{sea lions}} breed gregariously between May and August, {{when they arrive}} at their {{breeding}} rookeries. When establishing a territory, the males will try to increase their chances of reproducing by staying on the rookery {{for as long as}} possible. During this time, they will fast, relying on a thick layer of fat called blubber for energy. Size and patience allow a male to defend his territory more effectively; the bigger the male, the more blubber he can store and <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> can wait. A male sea lion usually keeps his territory for around 27 days. Females have long parturition intervals, and thus the males do not establish their territories until after the females give birth. Most fights occur during this time. After this, the males rely on ritualized displays (vocalizations, head-shaking, stares, bluff lunges, and so on) to maintain their territorial boundaries. Since temperatures can reach over [...] during this time, males must include water within their territories. Some territories are mostly underwater, particularly those near steep cliffs. Sea lions that fail to establish a territory are driven out to sea or gather at a nearby beach.|$|E
500|$|He {{found the}} work in the Court of Appeal dull, and his {{disappointment}} increased <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> worked. As in the High Court, he felt uncertain about his judgements and unsure as to whether he was affecting the law. Despite his personal opinion of himself, the judiciary as a whole felt that his mix of humanity and common sense was beneficial to the court. During the 1951 Long Vacation he broadcast three talks for the BBC on the subject of international law and its growth and gave a speech for the Law Society titled [...] "The Lawyer's Contribution to Society". Despite his unhappiness with his work in the Court of Appeal, he worked until 1956, when his long service as a judge allowed him to draw a pension. In his remaining time in the Court of Appeal, Birkett judged several notable cases, in particular Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemists (Southern) Ltd [...] 1 QB 401, and Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corporation [...] 2 QB 327, where the court made a landmark decision on acceptance of a contract in relation to Telex. From April 1958 to October 1961 he sat as a Law Lord, where his cases included De Demko v Home Secretary [...] AC 654 and Ostime v Duple Motor Bodies Ltd [...] AC 459.|$|E
60|$|Here he {{made his}} arrangements. Throwing down his buffalo robe, he took the coil of line and cut {{off a piece of}} about three yards in length. On this he made a running noose. <b>The</b> <b>longer</b> line <b>he</b> also {{prepared}} with a running noose. These he threw in a coil over his arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah then, if it HAS {{done for}} {{her what she}} wished-!" [...] But the Colonel's {{conclusion}} hung by the [...] "if" [...] which his wife didn't take up. So it hung but <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> when <b>he</b> presently spoke again. [...] "All one wonders, in that case, is why then she has come back to him." ...|$|R
50|$|When Shigetane {{realized}} he could not hold <b>the</b> fortress any <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> committed seppuku and all soldiers suicide attack. The Shimazu took the castle and were impressed with Shigetane's loyal conduct; {{they are said to}} have prayed for his deceased spirit.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> was in Paris, {{the more}} he had an Asian {{aesthetic}} for flowers. As {{he said to his}} brother Theo: [...] "You will see that by making a habit of looking at Japanese pictures you will come to love to make up bouquets and do things with flowers all the more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Weston {{continued}} {{to photograph the}} people and things around him, and his reputation in Mexico increased <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> stayed. He had a second exhibition at the Aztec Land Galley in 1924, {{and he had a}} steady stream of local socialites asking him to take their portraits. At the same time, Weston began to miss his other sons back in the U.S. As with many of his actions, though, it was a woman who motivated him most. He had recently corresponded [...] with a woman he had known for several years named Miriam Lerner, and as her letters became more passionate he longed to see her again.|$|E
60|$|He waited there a good while, and <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> waited the prouder he became.|$|E
60|$|Ken {{could stand}} <b>the</b> {{deception}} no <b>longer.</b> <b>He</b> marvelled at Reddy's consummate lying {{and how he}} could ever stand that look on Worry's face. Bounding down-stairs four steps at a jump, Ken burst like a bomb upon the sad-faced group.|$|R
60|$|It {{was there}} in Assisi, {{on the morning of}} {{striking}} his camp again, that Cesare completed the work that had been begun at Sinigaglia by having Paolo Orsini and the Duke of Gravina strangled. There was no cause to delay <b>the</b> matter <b>longer.</b> <b>He</b> had word from Rome of the capture of Cardinal Orsini, of Gianbattista da Virginio, of Giacomo di Santacroce, and Rinaldo Orsini, Archbishop of Florence.|$|R
60|$|But Farmer Brown's boy didn't move, {{and at last}} Whitefoot {{could stand}} <b>the</b> temptation no <b>longer.</b> <b>He</b> darted out halfway, scurried back, came out again, and at last ventured {{right up to the}} crust. Then he began to drag it back to the woodpile. Still Farmer Brown's boy did not move.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Waddington looked curiously at his assistant, and <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> looked, {{the more}} {{convinced}} he became that Burton was not himself.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> looked, however, and {{the more}} he rubbed his eyes, the more {{convinced}} was he that a vessel was really in sight.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Lynn still lingered. <b>The</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> {{looked at}} his companion, the more he {{appreciated}} the subtle change of demeanor and language which had certainly transformed Mr. Alfred Burton.|$|E
60|$|Neale took up lodgings {{with his}} friend Larry. He did not at first tell the cowboy about his {{recovery}} of Allie Lee and then her loss for the second time; and when finally he could not delay <b>the</b> revelation any <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> regretted {{that he had been}} compelled to tell.|$|R
50|$|He had a {{personal}} best of 13:45.37 minutes in the 5000 metres, achieved in March 2002 in Bellville, and 28:24.61 minutes in the 10,000 metres, achieved in March 2002 in Port Elizabeth. In <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> races <b>he</b> had 1:02:44 hours in the half marathon and 2:07:06 hours in the marathon, both achieved in April 2002 in the London Marathon. Ian Syster and his two-month-old son drowned in December 2004 in Keimoes following a car accident.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2015, the {{election}} for the 79th district seat {{resulted in a}} draw. Both Eaton and his opponent (the Republican Mark Tullos) received exactly 4,589 votes. As per state law, the two candidates drew straws to determine the winner. As Eaton drew <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> straw, <b>he</b> was declared the winner and was therefore re-elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives. His win prevented the Republicans from achieving a three-fifths supermajority in the House.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> {{played the}} clearer and sharper the plan stood out. He saw his way now {{as clear as}} daylight. And his way too, {{to make a deal}} more in the end by it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. Earnshaw looked up, like me, to the countenance of {{our mutual}} foe; who, absorbed in his anguish, seemed insensible to {{anything}} around him: <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> stood, the plainer his reflections revealed their blackness through his features.|$|E
60|$|Reggie gulped. <b>The</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> {{looked at}} it, the harder this man's costume was to bear. His eye passed shudderingly from the brown shoes to the tweed trousers, {{to the green}} scarf, from the green scarf to the straw hat.|$|E
5000|$|Ford {{became an}} [...] "ethical vegetarian" [...] after {{working in a}} meatpacking plant as a {{teenager}} and while this is no <b>longer</b> <b>the</b> case, <b>he</b> still doesnt eat red meat.|$|R
5000|$|Cras {{encountered}} Samain's dramatic poem in 1910, {{ten years}} after its author's death. He adapted it by dividing it into four rather than the original two acts and slightly pruned <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> speeches. <b>He</b> described <b>the</b> work as a [...] "lyric tragedy" [...] rather than an opera, since {{there is very little}} action. The drama proceeds through a series of arcadian pastoral tableaus punctuated by Polyphème's long brooding soliloquies and his obsessive interrogations of Galatée's young brother Lycas.|$|R
50|$|Ado Kosk {{observed}} {{that it becomes}} more difficult to swing over the fulcrum as the arms of <b>the</b> swing become <b>longer.</b> <b>He</b> then designed and patented telescoping swing arms to gradually extend the arms for an increased challenge. The person able to swing over the fulcrum with the longest swing arms is the winner.|$|R
6000|$|He {{continued}} {{to gaze at}} the picture: <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> looked, the firmer he held it, the more he seemed to covet it. [...] "It is like!" [...] he murmured; [...] "the eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect. It smiles!" ...|$|E
60|$|In his {{guise of}} a French gentleman of leisure, Werper found little {{difficulty}} in deceiving his host and in ingratiating himself with both Tarzan and Jane Clayton; but <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> remained the less hopeful he became of an easy accomplishment of his designs.|$|E
60|$|But <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> {{watched the}} heavier grew his lids. Several times they closed {{to be dragged}} open again only by painful effort. Finally came a time that they {{remained}} closed and the young chest rose and fell in the regular breathing of slumber.|$|E
60|$|He crawled {{along the}} ground like a snake. Once {{he had to go}} around a big rock and {{actually}} tear his way among the thorns, which scratched him in a dozen places. But behind the rock the shelter was greater, and unable to stand <b>the</b> suspense any <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> set off on a run for his horse.|$|R
50|$|The bass guitarist {{and co-founder}} Gopal Metro {{decided to leave}} the band, playing his last show on March 10, 2007, in Charlottesville. At the same show, the vocalist Andy Deane {{announced}} that Tony Pugh would replace Metro. At the beginning of summer 2008 it was announced that Jordan Marchini would not be touring with <b>the</b> band any <b>longer.</b> <b>He</b> returned in 2011.|$|R
60|$|Now {{a strange}} thing happened. The higher the young man climbed the higher the birds seemed to be, and when he looked down the earth below {{appeared}} {{no bigger than a}} star. Sill he tried to go back, but he could not, and though he could not see <b>the</b> birds any <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> felt as if something were dragging him up and up.|$|R
