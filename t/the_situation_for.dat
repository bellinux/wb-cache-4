5|$|General E. P. Scammon led the December expedition, {{which was}} a {{diversion}} with mixed results. The purpose of the diversion was to draw Confederate forces away from a Union force led by General Averell, which was conducting a raid on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad near Salem, Virginia. Although Scammon captured Lewisburg, he soon retreated—making <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>for</b> Averell more difficult. Beginning December 1863, the regiment {{became part of the}} 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, Army of West Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Although several German states {{initially}} {{sided with}} Austria, they {{stayed on the}} defensive and failed to take effective initiatives against Prussian troops. The Austrian army therefore faced the technologically superior Prussian army with support only from Saxony. France promised aid, but it came late and was insufficient. Complicating <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>for</b> Austria, the Italian mobilization on Austria's southern border required a diversion of forces away from battle with Prussia to fight the Third Italian War of Independence on a second front in Venetia and on the Adriatic sea. The day-long Battle of Königgrätz, {{near the village of}} Sadová, gave Prussia an uncontested and decisive victory.|$|E
5|$|At 07:00 on 29 April, Major General Smith advised Ambassador Martin that {{fixed-wing}} evacuations should cease {{and that}} Operation Frequent Wind, the helicopter evacuation of US personnel and at-risk Vietnamese should commence.

At 10:00 Ambassador Martin confirmed General Smith's assessment and at 10:48 he contacted Washington to recommend Option 4, the helicopter evacuation. Finally at 10:51 the order was given by CINCPAC to commence Option 4; due to confusion {{in the chain of}} command, General Carey did not receive the execute order until 12:15. At 08:00 Lieutenant General Minh, commander of the VNAF and 30 of his staff arrived at the DAO compound demanding evacuation, signifying the complete loss of VNAF command and control.|$|E
5|$|In October 1893, a {{congress}} of miners {{was held in}} Grotte in the Province of Agrigento which was attended by some 1,500 people, including workers and small producers.

Small producers demanded measures to avoid exploitation by large owners. The minimum-age measure was meant to improve <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>for</b> the carusi, minors that worked in conditions of near-slavery that sparked public outrage and inspired many complaints.|$|E

After the massacre at Deir Yassin and the Jewish offensive of April that triggered the large-scale exodus of the Palestinian Arabs in other mixed cities, the Arab population of Jerusalem was frightened and feared for its fate.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>situation</b> <b>for</b> the French was dire. Not {{only had}} they been trounced in southwestern Germany, the legendary Alexander Suvorov {{was on his way}} to {{northern}} Italy with 60,000 Russians, to take command of Coalition forces there. Count Heinrich Bellegarde, positioned with 20,000 men in the Grisons, effectively isolated Masséna's force from any assistance out of Italy. Most threatening, Archduke Charles' main army lay less than a day away; in size alone, it could overwhelm him, or, if he withdrew to the west, its position cut off his avenue of withdrawal toward France. If Charles' left wing, commanded by Nauendorf, united with Hotze's force, approaching from the east, Masséna knew Charles would attack and very likely push him out of Zürich.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the youngest galactic supernova, G1.9+0.3, occurred in the late 19th century, considerably more recently than Cassiopeia A from around 1680. Neither supernova was noted at the time. In the case of G1.9+0.3, high extinction along the plane of the galaxy could have dimmed the event sufficiently to go unnoticed. <b>The</b> <b>situation</b> <b>for</b> Cassiopeia A is less clear. Infrared light echos have been detected showing that it was a type IIb supernova and was not in a region of especially high extinction.|$|E
5|$|When the United States {{entered the}} war in 1917, General John J. Pershing sent Brice P. Disque, a former army captain, to the Pacific Northwest to {{determine}} if local labor issues within the forest products industry could be quickly resolved. Disque met with mill owners {{and representatives of the}} Industrial Workers of the World, the union that was trying to organize loggers and sawmill workers in the Pacific Northwest. After studying <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>for</b> several months, Disque determined that the long-standing labor management dispute could not be resolved without direct intervention by the army. Based on Disque's report, the United States Army Signal Corps was given the job of reorganizing the forest products industry in the Pacific Northwest to support United States war production.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>for</b> the Swedish army in Pomerania {{deteriorated}} {{during the}} winter of 1675–76, the fleet, with Kronan as flagship, was ordered to sea again {{in a desperate attempt to}} relieve the hard-pressed Swedish land forces. The weather was unusually cold and large parts of the Baltic were iced in. The fleet, now under the command of the seasoned sea officer Claes Uggla, was blocked by ice when it reached Dalarö on 23 January. The Privy Councilor Erik Lindschöld had been assigned by the King to assist with the expedition, and he came up with the idea of cutting the fleet out of the ice to reach the open sea. Hundreds of local peasants were ordered out to open a narrow channel through the ice with saws and picks to the anchorage at Älvsnabben, more than 20km (12mi) away. On reaching the naval station on 14 February, three weeks later, it turned out that most of the sea outside the inner skerries was frozen as well. A storm hit the tightly packed ships and the ensuing movement of the ice crushed the hull of the supply vessel Leoparden, sinking it. A Danish force had managed to reach the open waters farther off and observed the immobilized Swedish ships from a distance. When temperatures fell even further, the project was declared hopeless and Lindschöld gave up the attempt.|$|E

5|$|By the 1990s {{the hotel}} was {{beginning}} to lose it reputation and a slow decline in popularity began which would culminate in tragedy for Tony Pike. In 1998, Pike had put the hotel up for sale. A deal was {{set up for the}} sale {{which turned out to be}} a scam and Pike was swindled out of £50,000. His son, Anthony Dale Pike, flew to Miami to resolve <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>for</b> his father. However, he was killed the same day of his arrival on 15 February 1998, shot twice in the head and dumped in a secluded forest at Virginia Key beach. Miami Dade Police detectives believed it was clear that he was killed by the people plotting to seize control of the hotel. The police arrested and questioned German tennis professional Thomas Heinz Knott over the murder, but the investigation led them to charge Italian TV producer Enrico Forti with fraud over the transfer of £50,000 from Anthony’s father. In June 2000, Forti was also convicted of murdering Anthony Dale Pike in Miami. Forti is now serving a lifetime prison sentence at the Everglades Correctional Institution in Florida.|$|E
5|$|In June 1944, Eichelberger {{was summoned}} to Sixth Army {{headquarters}} by Krueger. The Battle of Biak, where the 41st Infantry Division had landed in May, was going badly, and the airfields that MacArthur had promised {{would be available to}} support the Battle of Saipan were not in American hands. Eichelberger found that the Japanese, who were present in larger numbers than originally reported, were ensconced in caves overlooking the airfield sites. While the Americans were better trained and equipped than at Buna, so too were the Japanese, who employed their new tactics of avoiding costly counterattacks and exacting the maximum toll for ground gained. After seeing <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>for</b> himself, Eichelberger concluded that Fuller's 41st Infantry Division had not done too badly. Nonetheless, as at Buna, Eichelberger relieved a number of officers that he felt were not performing as the battle ground on. His orders were to supersede Fuller as task force commander rather than relieve him as division commander, but Fuller requested his own relief, and Krueger obliged him. On Eichelberger's recommendation, Fuller was replaced by Brigadier General Jens A. Doe. Krueger was unimpressed with Eichelberger's performance on Biak, concluding that Eichelberger's tactics were unimaginative, and no better than Fuller's, and may have delayed rather than expedited the capture of the island. On the other hand, MacArthur thought sufficiently highly of Eichelberger's performance to award him the Silver Star.|$|E
5|$|In October 1931 Alcalá Zamora and his {{interior}} minister, Miguel Maura, resigned. Manuel Azaña became Prime Minister. Desiring {{the job for}} himself, Lerroux became alienated, and his Radical Party {{switched to}} the opposition, leaving Azaña dependent on the Socialists for support. The Socialists, who favoured reform, objected {{to the lack of}} progress. The reforms that were made alienated the land-holding right. Conditions for labourers remained dreadful; the reforms had not been enforced. Rural landowners declared war on the government by refusing to plant crops. Meanwhile, several agricultural strikes were harshly put down by the authorities. Reforms, including the unsuccessful attempt to break up large holdings, failed to significantly improve <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>for</b> rural workers. By the end of 1931, King Alfonso, in exile, stopped attempting to prevent an armed insurrection of monarchists in Spain, and was tried and condemned to life imprisonment in absentia.|$|E

5|$|Las Casas's first {{proposed}} remedy {{was a complete}} moratorium {{on the use of}} Indian labor in the Indies until such time as better regulations of it were set in place. This was meant simply to halt the decimation of the Indian population and to give the surviving Indians time to reconstitute themselves. Las Casas feared that at the rate the exploitation was proceeding it would be too late to hinder their annihilation unless action were taken rapidly. The second was a change in the labor policy so that instead of a colonist owning the labor of specific Indians, he would have a right to man-hours, to be carried out by no specific persons. This required the establishment of self-governing Indian communities on the land of colonists – who would themselves organize to provide the labor for their patron. The colonist would only have rights to a certain portion of the total labor, so that a part of the Indians were always resting and taking care of the sick. He proposed 12 other remedies, all having the specific aim of improving <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>for</b> the Indians and limiting the powers that colonists were able to exercise over them.|$|E
5|$|The 2/10th {{remained}} in Syria until January 1942 when, after having endured a freezing cold winter that included snow, it was transported back to Palestine {{in preparation for}} a return to Australia. Following Japan's entry into the war the previous December, and in light of Allied reverses in the Pacific, the Australian government had requested the return of some of its forces in order to bolster the defence of Australia due to concerns about a possible invasion. The 2/10th subsequently embarked on the Dutch passenger ship, Nieuw Amsterdam, bound for Australia in early February 1942. Stopping over in Bombay, the battalion was transferred to the transport Nevassa on which they continued the journey to Adelaide where they arrived in late March, after which a period of reorganisation and training followed around Kilcoy in Queensland, before the battalion was committed to its next campaign: New Guinea. Following Japanese landings on the north coast of New Guinea in July, Australian forces in the area had been fighting a desperate holding action, which had seen them being pushed inexorably towards Port Moresby.
