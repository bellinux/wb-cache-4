25|$|The Holocaust {{has been}} {{explained}} away officially as merely {{the relocation of}} the Jewish population into areas of Eastern Europe where communications and transport networks are still very poor. Despite this, many Germans suspect the government has eliminated the Jews, but generally don't care or are too afraid of the Nazi authorities <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>or</b> do anything with this knowledge. Some surviving Jews escaped to Soviet territory, where they have provided testimony of the extermination efforts - while Nazi authorities decry this as Bolshevik propaganda, the outside world {{is aware of the}} Holocaust. The American president, however, remains neutral so as not to further damage relations, and refers only to vague 'human rights violations' he wishes to investigate while visiting Berlin.|$|E
500|$|The City {{was often}} criticized for {{appearing}} to fabricate {{much of its}} storyline. In one instance, Diane von Fürstenberg workers were reportedly angered that Port [...] "doesn't really work" [...] and was [...] "hardly ever in the office", elaborating that series producers would inhibit normal work operations by not allowing employees to move items in their offices. Freddie Fackelmayer, Port's former love interest, commented that the network [...] "never asked the cast <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>or</b> do anything", though the editing that followed portrayed him as a [...] "womanizing jerk".|$|E

500|$|Druckmann's writing philosophy, {{which he}} {{realized}} while talking to game designer Cory Barlog, is [...] "simple story, complex characters"; Druckmann dislikes video games with complicated exposition, but enjoys writing complex character relationships. Throughout his writing, Druckmann approaches scenes with focus on every character, attempting {{to enter the}} mindset of each individual character. He tries to ignore character tropes {{in an attempt to}} write [...] "honestly". Druckmann also writes with a minimalist mindset, often asking himself [...] "What is this scene really about? What's the least we have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>or</b> do to convey that and no more?" ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{coaching}} situation had been settled, Gillis next {{turned his attention}} back to trading Luongo. The Canucks were hoping to make a deal at the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. As the draft approached, it was reported the Canucks were also shopping Schneider. Originally, it was believed the rumors were an attempt by Gillis to gain leverage for any potential Luongo deals. However, in a surprise move, Schneider was trade to the New Jersey Devils for the ninth overall pick in the draft, which Vancouver used to select Bo Horvat. Fans, as well as both Luongo and Schneider, were shocked by the news. Luongo stated, [...] "I have to let this sink in and figure out what I'm going to do." [...] While Schneider stated he was not sure what <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>or</b> think and he was speechless, adding, [...] "it was nice to have resolution to the situation." ...|$|E
500|$|Cooper's acting style {{consisted}} of three essential characteristics: his ability to project elements of his own personality onto the characters he portrayed, to appear natural and authentic in his roles, and to underplay and deliver restrained performances calibrated for the camera and the screen. Acting teacher Lee Strasberg once observed: [...] "The simplest examples of Stanislavsky's ideas are actors such as Gary Cooper, John Wayne, and Spencer Tracy. They try not to act but to be themselves, to respond or react. They refuse <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>or</b> do anything they feel not to be consonant with their own characters." [...] Film director François Truffaut ranked Cooper among [...] "the greatest actors" [...] because {{of his ability to}} deliver great performances [...] "without direction". This ability to project elements of his own personality onto his characters produced a continuity across his performances to the extent that critics and audiences were convinced that he was simply [...] "playing himself".|$|E
5000|$|... to Asanga's view, karma (Tibetan: las) is {{a mental}} impulse. It {{is synonymous with}} the mental factor of an urge (Tibetan: sems-pa). An urge is a mental factor that accompanies every moment of our experience. It is the mental factor that brings us in the {{direction}} of a particular experience, either simply to look at or to listen to something, or, in this case, to do something with <b>or</b> <b>to</b> it, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, <b>or</b> <b>to</b> think it. Whether it is physical, verbal, or mental karma, the karmic impulse is the mental factor of an urge <b>to</b> do, <b>say,</b> <b>or</b> think something. It is like the impulse to hit someone, to tell the truth, or to think longing thoughts about a loved one. It is also the mental urge <b>to</b> continue doing, <b>saying,</b> <b>or</b> thinking something, as well as the mental urge to stop engaging in them and <b>to</b> do, <b>say,</b> <b>or</b> think about something else. Usually, we are not at all aware of these mental urges or impulses. In Western terminology, we would say they are usually [...] "unconscious." ...|$|R

500|$|Seven {{months into}} her captivity, Garrido {{introduced}} Dugard to his wife, Nancy, {{who brought the}} child a stuffed animal and chocolate milk, and engaged in the same tearful apologies to her. Though Dugard craved the woman's approval at the time, in retrospect she has stated that she was manipulated by Nancy, who alternated between motherly concern and coldness and cruelty, expressing her jealousy of Dugard, whom she regarded as the one to blame for her predicament. Dugard characterized Nancy, {{who worked as a}} nursing home aide, as [...] "evil" [...] and [...] "twisted." [...] When Garrido was returned to prison for failing a drug test, Nancy replaced her husband as Dugard's jailer. The Garridos manipulated Dugard further by presenting her, on two occasions, with kittens that would later [...] "mysteriously vanish." [...] When they discovered that she was signing her real name in a journal that she kept on the kittens, she was forced to tear out the page with her name on it, the last time she would be permitted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>or</b> write her name until years later. She was never allowed to see a doctor or dentist.|$|E
500|$|A master's thesis by Marion Little (2008) {{says that}} {{the roots of the}} NVC model {{developed}} in the late 1960s, when Rosenberg was working on racial integration in schools and organizations in the Southern United States. The earliest version of the model (observations, feelings, and action-oriented wants) was part of a training manual Rosenberg prepared in 1972. The model had evolved to its present form (observations, feelings, needs and requests) by 1992. The dialog between Rosenberg and NVC colleagues and trainers continued to influence the model, which by the late 2000s placed more importance on self-empathy as a key to the model's effectiveness. Another shift in emphasis, since 2000, has been the reference to the model as a process. The focus is thus less on the [...] "steps" [...] themselves and more on the practitioner's intentions in speaking ("is the intent to get others to do what one wants, or to foster more meaningful relationships and mutual satisfaction?") in listening ("is the intent to prepare for what one has <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>or</b> to extend heartfelt, respectful attentiveness to another?") and the quality of connection experienced with others.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Joshua Yehl {{gave the}} fourth part of [...] "Trinity War", Justice League of America #7, a 6.5 out of 10. Yehl said, [...] "With {{nearly two dozen}} heroes filling up every ounce of panel space, the reading {{experience}} becomes stretched thin as writers Geoff Johns and Jeff Lemire try to find something for everyone <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>or</b> do. The result is an event comic that has two more issues to go yet still hasn’t decided exactly what this story is really about." [...] He however, enjoyed Lex Luthor's appearance in the issue. Conversely, Richard Gray of Newsarama gave the issue an 8 out of 10, saying [...] "For all the false starts and misdirection of the New 52, the first major crossover in “Trinity War” has come together nicely. While {{there is still the}} pervading sense that this is merely a set-up for the next major event, the “Forever Evil” villains month, there’s no denying that it has been a hell of a ride so far," [...] adding [...] "all of the previously disparate elements from the various series begin to coalesce into something major." [...] Jim Johnson of Comic Book Resources gave the issue 4 stars out of 5, feeling it was [...] "loads of fanboy fun" [...] and the issue actually progressed the series storyline, not just the event's storyline.|$|E

2500|$|Esperanto {{words are}} mostly derived by {{stringing}} together roots, grammatical endings, {{and at times}} prefixes and suffixes.

Speakers may optionally insert an o between the words in a compound noun if placing them together directly without the o would make the resulting word hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>or</b> understand.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1946, Miles was {{informed}} that by Lockspeiser of the immediate discontinuation {{of the project and}} to cease work on the M.52. Frank Miles later stated of this decision: [...] "I did not know what <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>or</b> think when this extraordinary decision was sprung upon me, without warning of any kind. At our last official design meeting all members, including the Ministry and Power Jets' representatives, had been cheerful and optimistic". According to Frank Miles, when he approached Lockspeiser for reasons behind the cancellation, he {{was informed}} that it was due to economic reasons; Lockspeiser also stated his believe that aeroplanes would not fly supersonically for many years and may not ever do so. By this point, the postwar Labour government, headed by Clement Attlee, had implemented dramatic budget cuts in various areas, which may have provided an inducement for the cancellation of the M.52, which was projected to involve considerable cost. According to Wood, [...] "the decision not to go ahead was purely a political one made by the Attlee Government".|$|E
2500|$|In 2010 Lee, {{together}} with his son Lee Hsien Loong, and Goh Chok Tong, threatened legal action against The New York Times Company, which owns the International Herald Tribune, regarding an Op-Ed piece titled [...] "All in the Family" [...] of 15 February 2010 by Philip Bowring, a freelance columnist and {{former editor of the}} Far Eastern Economic Review. The International Herald Tribune apologised in March that readers of the article may [...] "infer that the younger Lee did not achieve his position through merit". The New York Times Company and Bowring also agreed to pay S$60,000 to Lee Hsien Loong, S$50,000 to Lee and S$50,000 to Goh (totalling about US$114,000 at the time), in addition to legal costs. The case stemmed from a 1994 settlement between the three Singaporean leaders and the paper about an article, also by Bowring, that referred to [...] "dynastic politics" [...] in East Asian countries, including Singapore. In that settlement, Bowring agreed not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>or</b> imply that the younger Lee had attained his position through nepotism by his father Lee Kuan Yew. In response, media-rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders wrote an open letter to urge Lee and other top officials of the Singapore government to stop taking [...] "libel actions" [...] against journalists.|$|E
