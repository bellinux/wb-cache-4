25|$|The most absurd {{part of this}} absurd fraud (at least, to English eyes) is one which, oddly enough, has {{received}} comparatively little comment. I mean {{the point at which}} the Mayor asked for a warrant, and the Captain pointed to the bayonets of his soldiery and said, 'These are my authority'. One would have thought anyone would have known that no soldier would <b>talk</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
2500|$|He soon {{begins to}} be {{attracted}} to Moore's rebellious daughter - Bobby's sister Ariel - who is dating dirt-track driver Chuck Cranston. After an insult from Chuck, Ren ends up in a game involving buses, and wins despite his inability to drive one. Reverend Moore distrusts Ren and forbids Ariel from ever seeing him again. Ren and his classmates want {{to do away with}} the law and have a senior prom. After a while Ariel begins to fall for Ren and dumps Chuck, they fight and Chuck hits her. Later in church, Moore asks if Ren beat up Ariel. When Moore demands Ren's arrest, Ariel tells him that he can't blame everything on Ren just like he did with Bobby. She then reveals that she is no longer a virgin, which prompts Moore to beg for her to not <b>talk</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> in church, having Ariel sarcastically ask Moore if he will pass another law, and how it didn't stop her and Chuck from having sex. But Moore slaps her without warning, which shocks Vi, Moore's wife, and prompts Ariel to tearfully and angrily criticize Moore for slapping her, and storm out of the church. Moore tries to apologize, but Vi stops Moore, telling him, [...] "You've done enough." [...] Vi is supportive of the dancing movement, explaining to Moore he cannot be everyone's father, and that he is hardly being good to Ariel. She also says that dancing and music are not the problem.|$|E

6000|$|The rural nodded. [...] "The American <b>talked</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Quick and short, {{but what}} he said went. However, {{we will go to}} Salinas with you when you are ready." ...|$|R
