5|$|Initially making only {{tentative}} forays onto land, tetrapods {{adapted to}} terrestrial environments {{over time and}} spent longer periods away from the water. It {{is also possible that}} the adults started to spend some time on land (as the skeletal modifications in early tetrapods such as Ichthyostega suggests) <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> in the sun close to the water's edge, while otherwise being mostly aquatic.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} cold-adapted and {{hibernate}}s in the winter. In Great Britain, {{males and females}} hibernate for about 150 and 180 days respectively. In northern Sweden hibernation lasts 8–9 months. On mild winter days, they may emerge <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> where the snow has melted and will often travel across snow. About 15% of adults and 30–40% of juveniles die during hibernation.|$|E
5|$|The turtle starts its day at sunrise, {{emerging}} from the water <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> for several hours. Warmed for activity, it returns to the water to forage. After becoming chilled, the turtle re-emerges for one to two more cycles of basking and feeding. At night, the turtle drops {{to the bottom of}} its water body or perches on an underwater object and sleeps.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from direct}} catches, {{by-catches}} in trawl nets {{have been one}} of several threats <b>to</b> <b>basking</b> sharks. In New Zealand, basking sharks had been abundant historically, however, after the mass by-catches recorded in 1990s and 2000s, confirmations of the species became very scarce. Management plans have been declared to promote effective conservations.|$|R

50|$|The coasts round Britain {{and the sea}} {{nearby is}} of {{international}} significance. Animal life varies from large whales, dolphins and porpoises, grey seals and common seals, through to microscopic animals. There are more than 200 species of fish, ranging from small fish like blennies through <b>to</b> <b>basking</b> sharks that are the second largest shark in the world.|$|R
5|$|This {{species is}} mainly diurnal, {{especially}} {{in the north of}} its range. Further south it is said to be active in the evening, and it may even be active at night during the summer months. It is predominantly a terrestrial species, although it has been known to climb up banks and into low bushes in order <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> or search for prey.|$|E
5|$|New Guinea {{crocodiles}} have {{a mostly}} aquatic lifestyle and are largely nocturnal. They {{spend much of}} the day underwater, often with their nostrils and eyes above the surface. Powerful side-to-side movements of their tails propel them through the water and they use both tail and legs to steer. When on land, they favour shady, dense areas of undergrowth. They tend <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> in a group during the day, dispersing at night to feed.|$|E
5|$|The Hawaiian monk seal, as {{the name}} suggests, lives solely in the Hawaiian archipelago. Monk seals {{migrated}} to Hawaii between 4–11 million years ago (mya) through an open water passage between North and South America called the Central American Seaway. The Isthmus of Panama closed the Seaway approximately 3 million years ago. The species may have evolved in the Pacific or Atlantic, but in either case, came to Hawaii long before the first Polynesians. When monk seals are not hunting or eating, they generally bask on the beaches; Hawaiian monk seals tend <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> on sandy beaches and volcanic rock of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.|$|E
50|$|The seas by Peel {{are home}} <b>to</b> <b>basking</b> sharks {{in early summer}} (these are mostly {{harmless}} to humans - they don't bite). These sharks are seen occasionally from the land and more often from boats. Seals are often to be found around the breakwater by the castle. A variety of seabirds live and feed around the harbour, castle and headland.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} deal, Telcordia’s Advanced Technology Solutions {{business}} unit, the company’s research arm, was rebranded as Applied Communication Sciences, {{becoming a}} wholly owned subsidiary of Ericsson operating independently on day-to-day operations pursuant to a proxy structure mandated by the U.S. government. In October 2012, Applied Communication Sciences relocated its headquarters <b>to</b> <b>Basking</b> Ridge, New Jersey, occupying the former headquarters of AT&T Wireless.|$|R
60|$|The {{first great}} change {{regarded}} the locality of the Melanesian school in New Zealand. Repeated experience {{had shown that}} St. John's College was too bleak for creatures used <b>to</b> <b>basking</b> under a vertical sun, {{and it had been}} decided to remove to the sheltered landing-place at Kohimarama, where buildings for the purpose had been commenced so as to be habitable in time for the freight of 1859.|$|R
5|$|The young may all hatch in {{a single}} night. Crocodilians are unusual among {{reptiles}} {{in the amount of}} parental care provided after the young hatch. The mother helps excavate hatchlings from the nest and carries them to water in her mouth. Newly hatched crocodilians gather together and stay close to their mother. For spectacled caimans in the Venezuelan llanos, individual mothers are known to leave their young in the same nurseries, or crèches, and one of the mothers guards them. Hatchlings of many species tend <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> in a group during the day and disperse at nightfall to feed. The time it takes young crocodilians to reach independence can vary. For American alligators, groups of young associate with adults for one to two years, while juvenile saltwater and Nile crocodiles become independent in a few months.|$|E
5|$|Dry land is also {{important}} as it provides opportunities for basking, nesting, and escaping from temperature extremes. Gaping allows evaporation of moisture from the mouth lining and has a cooling effect, and several species make use of shallow burrows on land to keep cool. Wallowing in mud can also help prevent them from overheating. Four species of crocodilians climb trees <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> in areas lacking a shoreline. The type of vegetation bordering the rivers and lakes inhabited by crocodilians is mostly humid tropical forest, with mangrove swamps in estuarine areas. These forests are of great importance to the crocodilians, creating suitable microhabitats where they can flourish. The roots of the trees absorb water when it rains, releasing it back slowly into the environment. When the forests are cleared {{to make way for}} agriculture, rivers tend to silt up, the water runs off rapidly, the water courses can dry up in the dry season and flooding can occur in the wet season. Destruction of forest habitat is probably a greater threat to crocodilians than is hunting.|$|E
25|$|At higher altitudes due {{to strong}} winds the morning {{temperatures}} are low. Consequently, {{in order to}} gain the strength needed to perform body and wings activities they require <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> in the warmth of the sun.|$|E
50|$|Edward Wheeler Hall married Frances Noel Stevens on July 20, 1911. He {{was raised}} in Brooklyn, New York, {{receiving}} his theological degree in Manhattan. After graduation, he moved from New York <b>to</b> <b>Basking</b> Ridge, New Jersey, and then to St John the Evangelist Episcopal Church in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Edward was living at 23 Nichol Avenue in New Brunswick {{at the time of}} the murder. He was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.|$|R
50|$|McConnell {{was born}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1963. By age four he was {{learning}} to play the piano, and when his family relocated <b>to</b> <b>Basking</b> Ridge, New Jersey, in 1969 he continued his musical studies, eventually playing in bands with friends by his seventh grade. His father, Dr. Jack B. McConnell, worked at McNeil Laboratories and helped to develop Tylenol and the MRI. The elder McConnell then started a free health clinic, Volunteers in Medicine, that is staffed by retired health workers in Hilton Head, South Carolina.|$|R
5000|$|Gigantothermy allows {{animals to}} {{maintain}} body temperature, but {{is most likely}} detrimental to endurance and muscle power as compared with endotherms due to decreased anaerobic efficiency. [...] Mammals' bodies have roughly {{four times as much}} surface area occupied by mitochondria as reptiles. Increased mitochondria, necessitating larger energy demands, and consequently producing more heat to thermoregulate. An ectotherm the same size of an endotherm {{would not be able to}} remain as active as the endotherm, as heat is modulated behaviorally rather than biochemically. More time is dedicated <b>to</b> <b>basking</b> than eating.|$|R
25|$|Birdwings inhabit rainforests {{and adults}} are usually glimpsed along the forest periphery. They feed uponand are {{important}} long-range pollinators ofnectar-bearing flowers {{of the forest}} canopy, as well as terrestrial flowers, such as lantana. They are strong flyers and seek sunlit spots in which <b>to</b> <b>bask.</b>|$|E
25|$|Black marsh turtles are shy creatures. Mostly aquatic and nocturnal, {{they will}} {{sometimes}} {{come out to}} land at night to forage or mate, and occasionally during the day <b>to</b> <b>bask.</b> Majority {{of the time they}} prefer to stay underwater, partially buried in mud in shallow water or swimming near the bottom in deeper still waters.|$|E
25|$|The {{flight of}} the mime also resembles that of the model, fluttering, neither weak nor strong, {{sometimes}} staying {{close to the ground}} and at other times flying strongly up into the treetops. It mud-puddles on stream banks in summer. Known <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> and usually sits with the wings spread wide open while feeding on nectar from flowers.|$|E
50|$|A {{feeling of}} {{involvement}} {{is also necessary}} for BIRGing to occur. It is frequently seen as a cognitive process that affects behavior. In Bernhardt's et al. (1998) study, researchers examined physiological processes related <b>to</b> <b>Basking</b> in Reflected Glory, specifically, changes {{in the production of}} endocrine hormones. Endocrine system Fans watched their favorite sports teams (basketball and soccer) win or lose. The men's testosterone levels increased while watching their team win, but decreased while watching their team lose. Thus, this study shows that physiological processes may be involved with BIRGing, in addition to the known changes in self-esteem and cognition.|$|R
50|$|This turtle {{is found}} {{in a variety of}} wetland {{habitats}} and littoral zones, particularly shallow watercourses with a slow current and muddy bottom. Although they are more aquatic than some turtles, they are also capable of climbing, and may be seen basking on fallen trees and woody debris. Fallen trees and coarse woody debris are known to be important components of wetland habitat, and may be particularly beneficial <b>to</b> <b>basking</b> turtles. Like all turtles, they must nest on land, and shoreline real estate development is detrimental. They hibernate buried in the mud under logs, or in muskrat lodges.|$|R
60|$|Now, it {{was plain}} to {{everybody}} that the British {{had heard of}} the leisurely advance of this American general, and that he had left his command and come <b>to</b> <b>Basking</b> Ridge <b>to</b> take his ease at an inn, and so they had sent a detachment to capture him. Soon the women of the house came to General Lee, and urged him to hide himself under a feather bed. They declared that they would cover him up so that nobody would suspect {{that he was in the}} bed; then they would tell the soldiers that he was not there, and that they might come and search the house if they chose.|$|R
25|$|The brown awl flies {{as low as}} 6 {{feet over}} the bushes or as high as 60 to 75 feet in the canopy. The adults feed at lower levels on flowers of shrubs and small trees, but ascend to higher reaches of the {{vegetation}} to lay eggs or <b>to</b> <b>bask,</b> which it does very occasionally, holding its wings flat with the forewings covering the hindwings thus giving an arrowhead effect. The flight of the butterfly is fast and bounding with an audible wing beat.|$|E
25|$|The school's origins are {{detailed}} in the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy (2002-2004) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. Jool Noret of the ocean-covered planet Ginaz uses personal tragedy {{to make himself}} a fierce and innovative warrior, distinguishing himself in the ongoing war against the machine forces of Omnius in the Butlerian Jihad. Despite his reluctance <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> in fame or accept students, young warriors flock to Ginaz for training; he concedes, and eventually his unique fighting style becomes an art in its own right. Ultimately, the mercenaries of Ginaz are considered the most elite warriors available outside the Imperial Sardaukar.|$|E
25|$|This {{butterfly}} frequents forest {{paths and}} streams. The male {{is fond of}} sun and avoids the shade. It frequents flowers especially of Mussaenda frondosa, Ixora coccinea, Jasminum species and Asystasia gangetica. Periodically raids thicker forest patches, especially where Atalantia species {{are to be found}} in search of females to mate with. Has a rapid unidirectional flight and frequently changes course, hopping up and down in its flight path. Difficult to catch. Known <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> in the sun. Attracted to damp patch and has greater tolerance to other butterflies and humans while lapping up the mineral rich moisture. Known to visit animal droppings.|$|E
60|$|Lee pressed slowly onward--ready {{to strike}} a great blow for himself, and unwilling to help anybody else strike a blow--until he came to Morristown; and, after staying there one night, he {{proceeded}} {{in the direction of}} Basking Ridge, a pretty village not far away. Lee left his army at Bernardsville, which was then known as Vealtown, and rode on <b>to</b> <b>Basking</b> Ridge, accompanied only by a small guard. There he took lodgings at an inn, and made himself comfortable. The next morning he did not go and put himself at the head of his army and move on, because there were various affairs which occupied his attention.|$|R
50|$|They {{leave the}} water <b>to</b> thermoregulate by <b>basking</b> {{in the sun}} on rocks, logs, and sandbanks.|$|R
50|$|In {{the winter}} most free ranging P. macdonellensis {{go into a}} state of torpor after midnight within the {{confines}} of rock crevices, and stay there until day breaks. In the morning, while they are still torpid, they move from the rock-crevices <b>to</b> <b>basking</b> sites exposed <b>to</b> the sun. Subsequently, this type of basking continues {{for the rest of the}} day. It appears that daily torpor is done in order to reduce the amount of daily expenditure by about 30%, and allows the species to live and reproduce in a challenging environment. It has also been observed that the species goes {{into a state of}} torpor in circumstances in which the species finds itself under acute energetic stress.|$|R
25|$|It is a diurnal species, {{but it can}} {{be found}} moving about and hunting at night as well. They are often found by turning over rocks within or near the brooks and streams they inhabit. They will also come out of the water <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> in the sun, often {{perching}} on branches or roots above or near the waters edge. Queen snakes are very alert to any potential danger and will drop into the water when disturbed. They are rather docile snakes, not too likely to bite and can be easily handled. However, in doing so, one risks being polluted by malodorous feces and anal musk, similar to the behaviour of the garter snake in this defense.|$|E
25|$|Forest tent {{caterpillars}} are ectotherms so {{they rely}} on sources of heat from the environment to raise their body temperatures. In order to do this, they bask together and benefit from group thermoregulation. Elevating body temperature is essential in increasing metabolic rates for movement and food processing, so proper thermoregulation leads to an increased rate of development. This {{is very important for}} M. distria caterpillars, which rely on fast growth in spite of low environmental temperatures to benefit from the high food quality and the smaller predation risk in the spring. Thus, it is an adaptive advantage <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> in groups. However, as caterpillars grow, thermoregulatory needs decrease and the benefit of group living is gradually overridden by other factors such as food competition.|$|E
25|$|Crocodilians {{are more}} closely related to birds and dinosaurs than to most animals {{classified}} as reptiles, the three families being included in the group Archosauria ('ruling reptiles'). Despite their prehistoric look, crocodiles are among the more biologically complex reptiles. Unlike other reptiles, a crocodile has a cerebral cortex and a four-chambered heart. Crocodilians also have the functional equivalent of a diaphragm by incorporating muscles used for aquatic locomotion into respiration. Salt glands are present in the tongues of crocodiles and they have a pore opening {{on the surface of the}} tongue, a trait that separates them from alligators. Salt glands are dysfunctional in Alligatoridae. Their function appears to be similar to that of salt glands in marine turtles. Crocodiles do not have sweat glands and release heat through their mouths. They often sleep with their mouths open and may pant like a dog. Four species of freshwater crocodile climb trees <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> in areas lacking a shoreline.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{caterpillars}} {{and adults}} are active during the daytime; however, most species of this taxa are night-flying. Moths are attracted by light, {{but there is}} one species, Borearctia menetriesii, that never comes <b>to</b> the light. <b>Basking</b> <b>to</b> accelerate digestion is common in the larval stages, and social behaviour may range from solitary to gregarious. Like most Lepidoptera, larvae produce a small silk pad before each moult, in which their prolegs are engaged.|$|R
40|$|In {{the very}} north of Britain, {{far from the}} bustling cities and picturesque {{countryside}} to the south, lies Western Europe’s greatest wilderness: the Scottish Highlands. This is a land shaped by the flow of ancient ice, where snow-capped mountains tower over ink-black lochs, Golden Eagles soar over heather-clad moors, and Red Deer stags engage in mortal combat {{for the right to}} win a mate. Along the coast, sea cliffs and offshore islands teem with millions of seabirds, while the seas themselves are home <b>to</b> <b>Basking</b> Sharks, Orcas and Bottlenose Dolphins. The Highlands may at first sight seem bleak and desolate, but they are also filled with secret wonders, from the ancient Caledonian pine forests to the vast Flow Country, and from the sheer granite cliffs of Handa to the mysterious depths of Loch Ness...|$|R
50|$|In {{the winter}} most free ranging P. macdonellensis {{go into a}} state of torpor after midnight within the {{confines}} of rock crevices, and stay there until day breaks. In the morning, while they are still torpid, they move from the rock-crevices <b>to</b> <b>basking</b> sites exposed <b>to</b> the sun.

It appears that daily torpor is done in order to reduce the amount of daily metabolic expenditure by about 30%, and allows the species to live and reproduce in a challenging environment. It has also been observed that the species goes {{into a state of}} torpor at air temperatures ranging from -1 °C to 36 °C, and often occurs under circumstances in which the species finds itself under acute energetic stress.|$|R
