5|$|Operation Desert Storm {{began on}} 17 January 1991, {{but for the}} first two weeks 3rd Battalion only {{conducted}} sporadic engagements with its Iraqi counterparts across the border. That all changed on 29 January, when several Iraqi divisions unexpectedly crossed the border and seized the Saudi town of Khafji, less than 15kilometers north of 3rd Battalion's position. During the attack the Executive Officer along with the Battalion Sergeant Major drove into the town on a rescue mission looking for two Army soldiers who had been captured. Although they were unable to find them, the Marines from 3rd Battalion did encounter an Iraqi patrol and exchanged rounds with them before escaping. While Saudi and Qatari units ultimately retook the town, 3rd Battalion played a vital role in both coordinating the attack and blocking further Iraqi advances southward. In addition, several heavy machine guns and forward air controllers from the battalion were shifted over to <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>and</b> took place in the assault. From 19–21 February, 3rd Battalion moved from Al Mish'ab to the forward assembly areas that it would be using to launch its attack into Kuwait. It was also during this period that 3rd Battalion was given its assignment for the ground offensive. Lacking heavy armor or motorized transport, the battalion (along with 2/3) would infiltrate Iraqi positions along the Saudi border and provide flank security {{for the rest of the}} 1st Marine Division to make its assault into Kuwait. On the night of 22 February, 3rd Battalion crossed the border into Kuwait, infiltrating past Iraqi minefields, tank traps, and other obstacles. Like many American units, 3rd Battalion encountered no Iraqi resistance and the biggest threat to the Marines came from friendly fire. Throughout the ground war, the battalion advanced steadily northwards, encountering no resistance but taking plenty of prisoners. 3rd Battalion arrived outside the Kuwait International Airport around 27 February where a SCUD missile landed near the battalion's command post. Several months later, 3rd Battalion returned to Hawaii, having suffered no combat casualties.|$|E
25|$|The United States, {{which had}} urged Iraqis {{to rise up}} against Saddam, did nothing to assist the rebellions. The Iranians, despite the {{widespread}} Shi'ite rebellions, {{had no interest in}} provoking another war, while Turkey opposed any prospect of Kurdish independence, and <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>and</b> other conservative Arab states feared an Iran-style Shi'ite revolution. Saddam, having survived the immediate crisis in the wake of defeat, was left firmly in control of Iraq, although the country never recovered either economically or militarily from the Gulf War.|$|E
25|$|The First Saudi State {{was founded}} in 1744. This period was marked by conquest of {{neighboring}} areas and by religious zeal. At its height, the First Saudi State included most of the territory of modern-day Saudi Arabia, and raids by Al Saud's allies and followers reached into Yemen, Oman, Syria, and Iraq. Islamic Scholars, particularly Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab and his descendants, {{are believed to have}} {{played a significant role in}} Saudi rule during this period. <b>The</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>and</b> their allies referred to themselves during this period as the Muwahhidun or Ahl al-Tawhid ("the monotheists"). Later they were referred to as the Wahhabis, a group of particularly strict, puritanical Sunni sect, named for its founder.|$|E

5000|$|Modern Saudi-Yemeni {{relations}} {{began in}} 1803 with {{an attack by}} Saudi forces of the territory of Zaydi Imamate {{with the help of}} some local Yemeni tribes. <b>The</b> <b>Saudis</b> won <b>and</b> had control over the Tihama region until 1818 when the forces of the Ottoman khedive of Egypt, Mohammed Ali Pasha, destroyed the Saudi state ...|$|R
500|$|The {{tribes of}} Southern Saudi Arabia and Northern Yemen were closely linked, and the Saudis enticed {{thousands}} of Yemeni workers in Saudi Arabia {{to assist the}} royalist cause. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>and</b> British, the Iraqis also sent plane loads of Baathist Yemenis to undermine Sallal's regime. The royalists fought for the Imam despite his father's unpopularity. One sheik said [...] "The Imams have ruled us for a thousand years. Some were good and some bad. We killed the bad ones sooner or later, and we prospered under the good ones". The hill tribes were Shia, like the Imam, while the Yemenis of the coast and the south were Sunni, as were most Egyptians. President Sallal was himself a mountain Shia fighting with lowland Sunnis. Al-Badr himself was convinced that he was Nasser's biggest target, saying [...] "Now I'm getting my reward for befriending Nasser. We were brothers, but when I refused to become his stooge, he used Sallal against me. I will never stop fighting. I will never go into exile. Win or lose, my grave will be here".|$|E
500|$|In Europe, he {{particularly}} frequented Berlin {{where he}} worked with the prominent Arab nationalist intellectual Shakib Arslan to proliferate anti-French sentiment, leading the French Mandatory authorities to label Quwatli one of the [...] "most dangerous" [...] Syrian exiles. He developed close ties with Ibn Saud, who by 1925 ruled much of Arabia, having overrun the Hashemites in the Hejaz. Quwatli had a prior relationship with the House of Saud, stemming from his own family's commercial links with <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>and</b> Quwatli's friendship with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, a Syrian adviser to Ibn Saud, who Quwatli had dispatched to Arabia during Faisal's rule. Quwatli, strongly distrustful of the Hashemites, was impressed by Ibn Saud's relatively quick conquest over much of Arabia and saw in the Saudis a strong potential ally against British and French imperialism in the Middle East. By 1925, Quwatli had solidified his position as the intermediary between Ibn Saud and the Syrian-Palestinian Congress. His acquisition of Saudi funding put him {{at odds with the}} Congress's chief financier Michel Lutfallah, however.|$|E

5000|$|House of Bush, House of Saud: The Secret Relationship Between the World's Two Most Powerful Dynasties is a 2004 book by Craig Unger that {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the Saudi Royal Family and the Bush extended political family. Unger asserts that the groundwork for today's terrorist movements and the modern wars that have sprung up about them was unintentionally laid more than 30 years ago with a series of business deals between <b>the</b> ruling <b>Saudis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> powerful Bush family. <b>The</b> <b>Saudis</b> received investments <b>and</b> military protection in exchange for cooperation on lucrative oil deals. The author claims that {{the result has been a}} shady alliance between [...] "the world's two most powerful dynasties." [...] Unger writes, [...] "Never before has an American president been so closely tied to a foreign power that harbors and supports our country's mortal enemies." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1801 and 1802, the Saudi Wahhabis under Abdul Aziz ibn Muhammad ibn Saud {{attacked}} and captured the holy Shia cities of Karbala and Najaf in Iraq and destroyed the tombs of Husayn ibn Ali {{who is the}} grandson of Muhammad, and Ali (Ali bin Abu Talib), the son-in-law of Muhammad (see: Saudi sponsorship mentioned previously). In 1803 <b>and</b> 1804 <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> captured Mecca <b>and</b> Madinah and demolished various tombs of Ahl al-Bayt and Sahabah, ancient monuments, ruins according to Wahhabis, they [...] "removed a number of what were seen as sources or possible gateways to polytheism or shirk" [...] - such as the tomb of Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad. In 1998 <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> bulldozed <b>and</b> poured gasoline over the grave of Aminah bint Wahb, the mother of Muhammad, causing resentment throughout the Muslim World.|$|R
25|$|While the {{campaign}} was successful, the power of <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> was not broken. They continued to harass Ottoman and Egyptian forces from the central Nejd region of the Peninsula. Consequently, Muhammad Ali dispatched another of his sons, Ibrahim, {{at the head of}} another army to finally rout <b>the</b> <b>Saudis.</b> After a two-year campaign, <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> were crushed <b>and</b> most of the Saudi family was captured. The family leader, Abdullah ibn Saud, was sent to Istanbul, and executed.|$|R
2500|$|Moore implicates the White House in {{allowing}} relatives of Osama bin Laden {{to leave the}} United States without being interviewed at length by the FBI. In his narration in the movie, Moore states that [...] "At least six private jets and nearly two dozen commercial planes carried <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>and</b> the Bin Ladens out of the U.S. after September 13."

2500|$|The Yemeni {{government}} has been driven in two since 2014, when a Shia group known as the Houthis seized control of the capital Sana'a. After months of tense coexistence, the Houthis made a constitutional declaration in early 2015 that placed them in de facto control of the government. President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi fled the capital to {{the southern city of}} Aden, former capital of South Yemen, and eventually evacuated to Saudi Arabia. With the support of <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>and</b> other Gulf states, Hadi remains the official leader of a provisional government based in Aden. The Houthis have struggled to achieve international legitimacy, with most countries continuing to recognize Hadi as Yemen's president, despite the formation of a [...] "national salvation" [...] government in 2016 without the cooperation of the Hadi administration.|$|E
2500|$|The United States and Saudi Arabia {{continued}} their post-war alliance during the Obama presidency, and the Obama Administration supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen during the Yemeni Civil War. However, tensions between <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>and</b> the United States arose following the Iranian nuclear deal, as Saudi Arabia and Iran have strained relations and have competed for {{influence in the}} Middle East. The Obama administration attempted to defuse tensions between the two countries, as it hoped for cooperation with both countries {{in regards to the}} Syrian Civil War and military operations against ISIS. Obama also criticized the human rights record of Saudi Arabia, particularly in regards to the imprisonment of Raif Badawi. When once asked whether Saudi Arabia was America's friend, Obama replied with [...] "It's complicated." [...] According to The Economist, {{thanks in large part to}} Obama, America’s relationship with Saudi Arabia became [...] "deeply strained" [...] under his tenure.|$|E

2500|$|The {{consequences}} of the 2003 invasion and the Arab Spring led to increasing alarm within the Saudi monarchy over the rise of Iran's influence in the region. These fears were reflected in comments of King Abdullah, who privately urged the United States to attack Iran and [...] "cut off {{the head of the}} snake". The tentative rapprochement between the US and Iran that began in secret in 2011 was said to be feared by <b>the</b> <b>Saudis,</b> <b>and,</b> during the run up to the widely welcomed deal on Iran's nuclear programme that capped the first stage of US–Iranian détente, Robert Jordan, who was U.S. ambassador to Riyadh from 2001 to 2003, said [...] "he Saudis' worst nightmare would be the [...] administration striking a grand bargain with Iran." [...] A trip to Saudi by US President Barack Obama in 2014 included discussions of US–Iran relations, though these failed to resolve Riyadh's concerns.|$|E

Clinton has also called upon the Arab states of the Persian Gulf to stop funding terrorist groups, saying: [...] "Once <b>and</b> for all, <b>the</b> <b>Saudis,</b> <b>the</b> Qataris <b>and</b> others need to stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations." ...|$|R
