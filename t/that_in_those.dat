5|$|Oxygen {{presents}} two spectrophotometric {{absorption bands}} peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760nm. Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using {{the measurement of}} the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform. This approach exploits the fact <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> bands {{it is possible to}} discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.|$|E

25|$|Domestic violence, or {{intimate}} partner violence (IPV) as it {{is sometimes}} called, is a worldwide problem. Domestic abuse includes physical, emotional and sexual violence of any form. A 1999 study examined the prevalence and characteristics of domestic abuse in five districts of northern India during 1995–1996.

Although many studies have examined professional identity, differences in cognitive-processing biases between Chinese student teachers with strong and weak professional identity are poorly understood. The current study adopted Tversky’s social-cognitive experimental paradigm to explore cognitive-processing biases in Chinese student teachers with strong and weak professional identity. Experiment 1 showed that participants with strong professional identity exhibited stronger positive-coding bias toward positive profession-related life events, relative to <b>that</b> observed <b>in</b> <b>those</b> with weak professional identity. Experiment 2 showed that participants with strong professional identity exhibited greater recognition bias for previously read items, relative to <b>that</b> observed <b>in</b> <b>those</b> with weak professional identity. Overall, the results suggested that participants with strong professional identity exhibited greater positive cognitive-processing bias relative to <b>that</b> observed <b>in</b> <b>those</b> with weak professional identity...|$|R

25|$|Beyond {{a quality}} leadership, {{the luck of}} having players {{of the highest quality}} grown from the own ranks or {{acquired}} cheaply as young talents and the fact <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> days the Italian and Spanish leagues were closed to foreign players, the perfect timing of the arrival of the new stadium was probably the most crucial point in securing Bayern a foremost position on the national and also European level.

After two decades of poor health, John Claypoole died in 1817. Mrs. Claypoole (the former Mrs. Ross), continued the upholstery business for 10 more years. Upon retirement, she {{moved in with her}} second Claypoole daughter, Susanna (1786–1875), in a section of Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.

25|$|The PAM {{sequence}} {{appears to}} be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nt of the protospacer. This nt becomes the final base in the first direct repeat. This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs in other organisms do not show {{the same level of}} conservation in the final position. It is likely <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> systems, a blunt end is generated {{at the very end of}} the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition.|$|E
25|$|Given <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> days most {{visitors}} arriving from Europe and North America {{arrived at the}} port on the Caribbean Sea shore, Reina Barrios pushed for the Northern Railroad to be finished on time.

25|$|Upamāṇa (उपमान), comparison, analogy. Some Hindu schools {{consider}} it as a proper means of knowledge. Upamana, states Lochtefeld, may be explained with {{the example of a}} traveler who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later. The subject of comparison is formally called upameyam, the object of comparison is called upamanam, while the attribute(s) are identified as samanya.|$|E

25|$|Three years later, Blake made a sharp {{break with}} his {{previous}} life. In September 1955, deciding that Hawaii {{had become too}} crowded and changed for the worse since his halcyon days, he left the island for good. For the next three decades, from 1955 well into the 1980s, Blake lived wherever the mood took him: in California at Malibu, Ventura, and in the Imperial Valley {{on the shore of}} the Salton Sea; in Florida, at Boca Raton; and finally back to Wisconsin. He lived in his vehicles - vans and station wagons - setting up camp and then moving on. His friend and biographer Gary Lynch reported <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> days, Blake owned one plate, one knife, one fork, one dish, and one chair.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{says that}} when he entered medical {{practice}} in the early 1960s, before the Medicare and Medicaid programs were established, the poor and the elderly were hospitalized at about the same rates as they have been under Medicare and Medicaid in the 2000s, and that they received good care. He says further <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> days, doctors and hospitals provided cut-rate or free care to people who did not have health insurance – “every physician understood that he or she had a responsibility toward the less fortunate, and free medical care for the poor was the norm” – and that this was possible because healthcare costs were much lower. At a church charity hospital where he worked in his early years of practice, “nobody was turned away” for lack of ability to pay.|$|E
25|$|Take {{for example}} {{one who is}} invited to dine with his colleagues or clients, would we allow him to avoid embarrassment by eating fruit and {{vegetables}} from which terumot and ma'asrot (which nowadays is Rabbinic) have not been removed, or by consuming hamets she-avar alav haPesah, or by drinking Stam yeynam (wine touched or poured by a non-Jew). Or alternatively, suppose someone is at a meeting and is ashamed to walk out in order to daven Minha. And what about prayers {{at the airport in}} between flights. Would we allow him to forgo his rabbinic prayer obligation because of this embarrassment? The answer is <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> cases where acting according to halakha - be it to not eat terumot and ma’asrot, or to not drink stam yeynam, or to fulfill ones prayer obligation – creates the embarrassment, then kevod ha-beriyyot cannot set aside the Rabbinic prohibition. One should be proud to be fulfilling the halakha.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not clear}} that the moot hill was also the actual site of executions; folklore, {{tradition}} and the association of separate 'gallow' places names with moot hills on balance suggests that the usual place of execution was a separate 'gallows hill'. At Gardyne Law however an eye witness recalled that judgement and execution took place on the same law. It does seems unlikely <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> superstitious days meetings would be held at places of death; at Mugdock separate moot and gallow hills are a good example. Such gallows may have been built of worked timber or a Dule Tree may have been used. RCAHMS records show that human bones have been frequently found in association with 'gallows' place name sites, but not at 'moot' sites. The term 'murder hole' may relate to the drowning sites, bones have been found close to some of these.|$|E
25|$|Bhishma {{is often}} {{considered}} as {{a great example of}} devotion and sacrifice. His name itself is an honour to him - Bhishma which means severe because he took a severe vow to remain celibate for life and Pitamah which means Grandfather. Bhishma {{was one of the greatest}} Bramhacharis of all time. Accumulation of Ojas due to his Bramhacharyam made him the strongest warrior of the era. He had stature and personality <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> times were fit for kings. He was a true Kshatriya as well as a disciplined ascetic - a rare combination. Like a true Kshatriya, he never unnecessarily exhibited passion and anger. A symbol of truth and duty, the benevolent Bhishma was in all senses a true human. It is unfortunate that a person as noble as Bhishma saw a life full of loneliness, frustration and sadness. But that was how Vashishta's curse was supposed to unfold. Bhishma's human birth was destined to be marked with suffering, and that was how his life transpired right till the last moment; even his death was very painful. But the strong as steel character which he possessed ensured that he never shied away from his duty, and never stopped loving those dear to him.|$|E

However, a sharp decline in the price of coffee and silver, along with the high technical difficulties of the railroad construction close to Guatemala City −mainly due to the steep cliffs and mountains around the city− resulted in the collapse of Guatemala's economy, a failure of the Exposición Centroamericana, and the eventual assassination of Reina Barrios, on 8 February 1898.|$|E
