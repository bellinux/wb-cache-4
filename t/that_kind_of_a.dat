500|$|Appian {{claims that}} at this point Spartacus changed his {{intention}} of marching on Rome—implying this was Spartacus' goal following the confrontation in Picenum—as [...] "he did not consider himself ready as yet for <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fight, as his whole force was not suitably armed, for no city had joined him, but only slaves, deserters, and riff-raff", and decided to withdraw into southern Italy once again. They seized the town of Thurii and the surrounding countryside, arming themselves, raiding the surrounding territories, trading plunder with merchants for bronze and iron (with which to manufacture more arms), and clashing occasionally with Roman forces which were invariably defeated.|$|E
500|$|Imagine co-founder Ron Howard was {{attached}} to direct the film, but turned it down after being asked by Russell Crowe to helm Cinderella Man (2004). Howard's Imagine partner Brian Grazer began {{looking for a new}} director. After Howard stepped down, Menno Meyjes contributed to Gewirtz's screenplay, and Terry George incorporated the Nazi Germany and diamond ring elements to the script. Meyjes was in negotiations to direct the film, but after he declined, Grazer thought this project was a chance to work with Spike Lee, who had already learned of Gewirtz's script. Lee said of the screenplay, [...] "I liked the script and really wanted to do it. Dog Day Afternoon,' directed by Sidney Lumet, {{is one of my favorite}} films, and this story was a contemporary take on <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like his father, Tatangelo, Jr., {{was born}} in Providence, Rhode Island, and was a {{downtown}} Laredo merchant for many years. Speaking on March 10, 2008, at his father's rosary, the junior Tatangelo continued: [...] "My dad and Laredo had a love affair for thirty-five years. They (people of Laredo) loved him, he loved them. They broke the mold when they made Aldo. There'll never be another one. It's interesting when a man can have <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> feeling for a city, and the city return it." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{a moment}} Mr. Worthington {{knew he had}} gone too far. <b>A</b> certain <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eye is an {{incomparable}} weapon, and armed men have been cowed by those who possess it, though otherwise defenceless. Jethro Bass had <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eye.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Chang Lucy," [...] was the reply. [...] "Mrs. Chang Lucy {{tells me}} {{everything}} {{that your mother}} tells her, and your mother tells her much. So {{let me tell you}} that mine is not <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ear." ...|$|R
6000|$|In her {{limitless}} gratitude {{the happy}} mother waived rank {{and hugged him}} too, calling him [...] "the angel of God in disguise." [...] And he probably was in disguise if he was <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> official. He was dressed for the character.|$|R
2500|$|When {{warned of}} {{potential}} domination by a Stalin dictatorship over part of Europe, Roosevelt {{responded with a}} statement summarizing his rationale for relations with Stalin: [...] "I just have a hunch that Stalin is not <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man[...] [...] [...] I think that if I give him everything I possibly can and ask for nothing from him in return, noblesse oblige, he won't try to annex anything and will work {{with me for a}} world of democracy and peace." [...] While meeting with Stalin and Roosevelt in Tehran in 1943, Churchill stated that Britain was vitally interested in restoring Poland as an independent country. Britain did not press the matter for fear that it would become a source of inter-allied friction.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Morin? Certainly not. He {{was never}} even a spectator at the races. Not <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man. Surprised the gentlemen should ask.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Is he <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man?’ I said, staring {{on these}} lamps as though I could {{decipher}} in them {{the secret of}} my cousin’s character.|$|E
5000|$|In The Simpsons episode [...] "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson", Marge Simpson cheers {{herself up}} with the poster before noticing the (incorrect) {{copyright}} date of 1968 and comments, [...] "...Determined or not, that cat must be long dead. <b>That's</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> downer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Like as not. Of {{course they}} are pretty exclusive. They hardly ever show {{themselves}} to the common public. I believe they never turn out except for an eleventh-hour convert. They wouldn't do it then, only earthly tradition makes a grand show pretty necessary on <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> occasion." ...|$|R
5000|$|Novera Ahmed (May 29, 1939 - May 5, 2015) was <b>a</b> modern {{sculptor}} <b>of</b> Bangladesh. She {{was awarded}} Ekushey Padak by the Government of Bangladesh in 1997. Artist Zainul Abedin described her work saying [...] "What Novera is doing now {{will take us}} {{a long time to}} understand - she is <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> artist.".|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chance. There's Sadie Howard at school--she don't have to work. She {{liked me}} before {{she found out}} where I lived..." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Me? Of course not. Why---er---if I {{knew he was}} <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man-----" [...] Andrew Felps {{broke off}} short. [...] "Were you {{listening}} to our talk?" ...|$|E
5|$|The moral {{systems of}} religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our {{kids in a}} {{religious}} way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And <b>that's</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.|$|R
2500|$|I {{think the}} sounds that <b>a</b> lot <b>of</b> {{people come to}} expect from us {{are based on the}} idea of large walls of very thick guitars. <b>That's</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{trademark}} for <b>a</b> lot <b>of</b> loud, aggressive rock music, {{but it can also be}} a crutch, or a wall that you can hide behind. But we didn't rely on that for this album, it actually doesn't have any of that." ...|$|R
60|$|When Harry and Kate held {{council that}} afternoon, their affairs {{looked a little}} discouraging. Kate's sumac was weighed, {{and it was only}} seven pounds! Seven whole cents, if they took it out in trade, or five and a quarter cents, as Kate calculated, if they took cash. A woman as large as Aunt Matilda could not be {{supported}} on <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> income, it was plain enough.|$|R
6000|$|... “I won’t take it {{at their}} hands,” cried I. “I ain’t <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man. You don’t find me {{turn my back}} on a parcel of Kanakas.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would make}} anybody laugh, Seth, {{to hear a}} feller no bigger'n you talk of such things. You must be a man to get <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> job." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{engineer}} nodded. [...] "I don't {{know what}} you are after, but I guess I can take your word," [...] he said. [...] "You seem <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man." ...|$|E
5000|$|It's {{coming along}} really well. We {{were hoping to}} have {{everything}} done by now, and we're not at all done. I keep writing more songs, so <b>that's</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> good thing, because I keep creating new things, and that's what's halting the process, {{because we have to}} go in and record that song. It's been a long, arduous process, but the harder you work on something, the prouder you are of it.|$|R
5000|$|Greg LoPiccolo later {{stated that}} [...] "When Warner Bros didn’t pick up our {{option for the}} third album; <b>that</b> was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> momentum-killer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The doggoned old skeesucks!" [...] Will soliloquized as {{he walked}} up the road. [...] "So <b>that's</b> the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{character}} he's been givin' me!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Read {{it out in}} church," [...] Langmaid suggested. [...] "It wouldn't sound pretty, Wallis, to {{be advertised}} in the post on Monday morning as owning <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hotel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I'm not <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> grasshopper," [...] replied Cap'n Bill. [...] "But I can't {{say what}} I might do if I was squeezed--which I hope I won't be." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "To have a top-three finish today, it's {{really a}} great day for us and {{a great day for}} Roush Fenway Racing and Ford," [...] Bayne said after {{finishing}} third. [...] "For our organization to be on the pole this weekend, to have three cars in the top eight, two in the top-five, I think <b>that's</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> landmark for us as an organization with the struggles we've had to get all three teams running strong on a weekend like this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{for your}} sake!" [...] he declared, harshly. [...] "Haven't you sense {{enough to see}} <b>that?</b> ... What <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> game {{do you think you}} can play with me?" ...|$|R
50|$|In 1976 CC {{left the}} PCE because the party banned {{cell-type}} organization, {{considering that the}} upcoming legalization made <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> organization <b>an</b> anachronism. CC left the party due to this decision.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Wada," [...] I said, [...] "he is not <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man. He is {{very hard}} and rough with all the sailors. He treats them like dogs. You know that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fine! fine!" [...] cried Dave, in pretended delight. He {{wished to}} humor the man until Phil {{returned}} with the others. [...] "It couldn't be better. You ought to patent <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mask." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hen Billard {{tried to}} turn it off, and said: [...] "Pshaw! You can have <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Fourth any day in the country. Who's {{going up to the}} court-house yard to see the fireworks?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... 7. [...] "What A Funny Girl (You Used To Be).": The album {{could have}} been a little bit maudlin and dour. I was trying to put <b>a</b> little bit <b>of</b> {{sunlight}} everywhere I could. It was a retrospective song. I also wanted to indicate in the song that they had been childhood sweethearts. I wanted <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> idea. They were probably kids together. I wanted to give the sense that they had gone to school together. They had fallen in love and married quite young.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the most}} {{astonishing}} story. A miracle, you might almost call it. Makes {{you believe in}} Fate and all <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing. <b>A</b> week ago I was on the Subway in New York...." ...|$|R
