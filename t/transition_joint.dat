40|$|A steam generator, {{wherein the}} boiler, steam drum, and {{superheater}} are integrated into one single unit, requires the welding of a <b>transition</b> <b>joint</b> between the 2 1 / 4 % Cr- 1 % Mo steel of the steam drum {{and the type}} 316 stainless steel of the superheater. A practicable procedure was developed for the welding of this <b>transition</b> <b>joint</b> and {{the properties of the}} weld were evaluated by mechanical testing and metallurgical evaluation. After evaluating the technical aspects of the project and their relation to the fabrication of the generator, it was considered desirable to overlay the welding edge of the 2 1 / 4 % Cr- 1 % Mo steel with a suitable austenitic weld metul which would subsequently be welded to the type 316 stainless steel of the superheater. Austenitic stainless steel and high-nickel alloy weld metals were evaluated for the overlay; whereas only austenitic stainless steel weld metals were evaluated for the final weld joining the components. It was concluded that type 309 stainless steel weld metal deposited automatically by the submergedarc process is completely satisfactory for cladding the 2 1 / 4 % Cr- 1 % Mo base metal and for making the final transition weld joining the steam drum and superheater sections of the generator.

40|$|From 2010 to 2015, MwRSF {{researchers}} {{developed the}} RESTORE barrier, {{which is a}} restorable MASH TL- 4 median barrier with a steel and concrete rail supported by elastomer posts and steel skids. The research effort reported herein describes the initial development of a transition from the RESTORE barrier to a rigid TL- 4 concrete buttress. The previously-developed RESTORE barrier LS-DYNA model was validated against three full-scale vehicle crash tests. Several design concepts were generated {{through a series of}} brainstorming efforts. The primary transition concept consisted of a pin and loop connection between the RESTORE barrier and rigid concrete buttress, which was designed and evaluated with LS-DYNA computer simulation. Vehicle and system behavior were investigated using MASH test designation nos. 4 - 20, 4 - 21, and 4 - 22. Six horizontal gusset plates and drop-down pin allowed for limited deflection and rotation at the <b>transition</b> <b>joint,</b> but provided shear continuity between the two systems. A rounded-edge cover plate mitigated vehicle snag on the <b>transition</b> <b>joint</b> hardware. Eleven impact points were evaluated with each vehicle model to determine critical impact points for use in a future full-scale crash testing program. All occupant risk measures and vehicle stability were within MASH limits.

40|$|The use of {{tungsten}} as a plasma-facing material necessitates a <b>transition</b> <b>joint</b> to the structural material {{of the primary}} coolant loop at some location in order to transport the coolant to the heat exchanger. A critical issue in transition joints is the thermal expansion mismatch between materials, {{which can lead to}} unacceptably high thermal stresses. Detailed 2 D and 3 D analyses were performed to study the behavior of a transition from tungsten to ferritic steel (FS) with an intermediate layer of tantalum, located outside of the high heat flux region. This thesis describes the results of FEM analyses including primary and secondary stresses under various time-dependent loading conditions such as warm and cold shutdown, and allowing for inelastic behaviors leading to stress relaxation and ratcheting. In previous FEM analyses at UCLA, it was concluded the residual stress in Ta exceeds the ultimate and tensile strength. In such configuration that is under high pressure and temperature loading conditions, plastic deformation has to be considered during the analysis. It also causes stress relaxation on the configuration. The results exhibited that the original <b>transition</b> <b>joint</b> did not satisfy the design requirement on maximum accumulated plastic principal strain due to stress concentration. Some modifications were made on the <b>transition</b> <b>joint.</b> Fabrication steps were analyzed in 2 D models utilizing ANSYS.
