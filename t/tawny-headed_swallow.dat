50|$|Although no {{subspecies}} of the <b>tawny-headed</b> <b>swallow</b> {{have been}} defined, {{it is known}} that, in general, the <b>tawny-headed</b> <b>swallow</b> differs slightly depending on where it occurs. A <b>tawny-headed</b> <b>swallow</b> that occurs {{in the southern part}} of its range will usually have a duskier cap, less distinct margins of the crown feathers, and will usually be slightly larger than those of northern populations. Although this is true, birds from both the northern and southern portion of its range overlap in size and characteristics. This fact means that there are most likely no subspecies. This swallow is also monotypic within its genus, Alopochelidon.|$|E

50|$|The nest of the <b>tawny-headed</b> <b>swallow</b> is {{cup-shaped}} {{and made}} of leaves, feathers, and straw. It usually measures 20 - 50 cm in length and 7 - 10 cm in width. The nest usually has a diameter of around 5 - 6 cm, a depth of 0.5 - 3 cm, and a height of 5 - 6 cm. The nest is constructed by both the male and female, usually {{over a period of}} 10 or 12 days. The nest can be found in hidden holes along rivers, streams, and ditches. The holes are usually at least 1 m deep, with a compartment at the end, where the nest is placed. Further research is required to determine whether this bird digs its own burrow or whether it steals tunnels from other species. The <b>tawny-headed</b> <b>swallow</b> usually nests in pairs or loose groups.|$|E
50|$|This swallow is {{native to}} Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela and vagrant to Chile and the Falkland Islands. The <b>tawny-headed</b> <b>swallow</b> is split up into 2 {{resident}} populations, one in southeast Venezuela, {{and the other in}} central and southern Brazil, eastern Bolivia, all of Paraguay except the Northwest portion of it, and northeast Argentina. It also occurs in Uruguay and part of central Argentina as a resident during the breeding season. It is not known where this population migrates, although there have been sightings of non-breeding tawny-headed swallows in eastern Colombia and southeastern Peru. This swallow can be found in open and mostly open tropical and subtropical areas, especially near small bodies of water, forest clearings near streams, and in pampas. It can also be found in wet or flooded areas of open grassland. It usually resides at altitudes up to 1600 m.|$|E
