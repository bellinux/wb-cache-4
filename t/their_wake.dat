5|$|As {{a result}} of outgassing, comets leave in <b>their</b> <b>wake</b> a trail of solid debris too large to be swept away by {{radiation}} pressure and the solar wind. If the Earth's orbit sends it though that debris, there {{are likely to be}} meteor showers as Earth passes through. The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle. Halley's Comet {{is the source of the}} Orionid shower in October.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, {{a number}} of {{alternative}} bands began to sign to major labels. While early major label signings Hüsker Dü and The Replacements had little success, acts who signed with majors in <b>their</b> <b>wake</b> such as R.E.M. and Jane's Addiction achieved gold and platinum records, setting the stage for alternative's later breakthrough. Some bands such as Pixies had massive success overseas while they were ignored domestically.|$|E

5|$|Around 1821, the Zulu general Mzilikazi of the Khumalo clan {{successfully}} {{rebelled against}} King Shaka and created his own clan, the Ndebele. The Ndebele fought their way northwards into the Transvaal, {{leaving a trail}} of destruction in <b>their</b> <b>wake</b> and beginning an era of widespread devastation known as the Mfecane. When Dutch trekboers converged on the Transvaal in 1836, they drove the tribe even further northward. By 1838, the Rozwi Empire, along with the other smaller Shona states were conquered by the Ndebele and reduced to vassaldom.|$|E
5|$|By 681 {{the armies}} of the Umayyad Caliphate had {{expanded}} from their original homeland of Arabia to conquer North Africa, the Middle East and large parts of West Asia, bringing Islam in <b>their</b> <b>wake</b> and converting local peoples to the new religion. The Berbers of North Africa, called Moors by the Christians, thereby became Muslims. The Strait of Gibraltar became the frontier between Muslim North Africa and Christian Hispania and thus gained a new strategic significance. Hispania descended into {{civil war in the}} 8th century as rival Visigothic factions fought for control of the throne. This gave the Moors the opportunity to invade Hispania and pursue a course of dividing-and-conquering the Christian factions.|$|E

Under interrogation, Tessa confesses to killing Greg but denies Ruby was at Lake Okobogee that night. Mulder and Scully return to the Morris' house, and, finding it deserted, discover the binary-covered pieces of paper laid out {{across the living room}} floor, forming an image of Ruby's face. The agents return to Lake Okobogee, where they find Darlene and Kevin in the nearby woods. A motorcycle gang appears, and as Mulder hurries to rescue Kevin from <b>their</b> <b>wake,</b> Scully discovers Ruby nearby.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} works were complex, and many contractors {{were involved in}} delivering them. The CTRL Section 2 {{construction works}} had caused considerable disruption around the Kings Cross area of London; in <b>their</b> <b>wake</b> redevelopment was stimulated. The large redevelopment area includes the run-down areas of post-industrial and ex-railway land close to King's Cross and St Pancras, a conservation area with many listed buildings; this was promoted {{as one of the}} benefits for building the CTRL. It has been postulated that this development was actually suppressed by the construction project, and some affected districts were said still to be in a poor state in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The {{efforts of}} the dukes to {{increase}} their power and to give unity to the duchy had met with a fair measure of success; but they were soon vitiated by partitions among different members of the family, which for 250 years made the history of Bavaria {{little more than a}} repetitive chronicle of territorial divisions bringing war and weakness in <b>their</b> <b>wake.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{video game}} market {{experienced}} {{a period of}} rapid growth and unprecedented popularity in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Consoles such as the Atari 2600 and the Intellivision proved to be wildly popular, and many third-party developers arose in <b>their</b> <b>wake</b> to exploit the growing industry. Nintendo was one such development studio, and, by 1982 had found success {{with a number of}} arcade games, such as Donkey Kong, which was in turn ported to, and packaged with the ColecoVision console in North America.|$|E
25|$|Around the 17th and 16th centuries BC most of {{the older}} centers had been overrun. The Mitanni, for a time, menaced the Hittite kingdom, but were {{defeated}} by it around {{the middle of the}} 14th. The Semitic Hyksos used the new technologies to occupy Egypt, but were expelled, leaving the empire of the New Kingdom to develop in <b>their</b> <b>wake.</b> From 1550 until 1100, much of the Levant was conquered by Egypt, which {{in the latter half of}} this period contested Syria with the Hittite Empire.|$|E
25|$|Few {{international}} tourists came to Melbourne in 1956 for the Olympics that year, but Sydney gained global {{attention for}} a well-attended, efficiently organized world-class event. Prince Philip, representing Queen Elizabeth II opened the 1956 games {{but neither was}} invited in 2000, as the spirit of republicanism was too strong. In the long run, as Toohey (2008) reports, many of the hoped-for benefits failed to materialize. Nationwide levels of participation in physical activity and sport did not rise, although passive spectatorship (such as TV watching) did increase. Many of the costly facilities built for the games remained underutilized in <b>their</b> <b>wake.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Daoist Liezi (ca. 4th century CE) uses zhenren in two chapters. The first usage (3, tr.

Hence our feelings by day and our dreams by night are the result of contacts made by mind or body. it follows that if we can concentrate the maid in abstraction, our feelings and our dreams will vanish of themselves.

25|$|A {{number of}} civilians who took shelter in house basements were killed. The killings largely took {{place as the}} lead {{elements}} of the attacking force, composed of regular JNA units, advanced and the SAO Krajina forces came in <b>their</b> <b>wake.</b> The JNA and SAO Krajina TO troops started searching houses in Škabrnja after a JNA tank was destroyed. People were either shot in shelters or were removed from their basements and interrogated, beaten or killed. In one instance, a captured HV soldier was beaten and his ears were cut off before {{he was shot in}} front of his family. A large majority of the killed civilians or prisoners of war were shot at point-blank range, and one woman was crushed to death by a tank.|$|E
25|$|The two crews {{set to work}} {{following}} <b>their</b> <b>wake</b> up call, {{preparing for}} the first spacewalk of the mission. Swanson and Arnold exited the Quest airlock at 16:22 UTC to begin {{the installation of the}} S6 truss segment. Once Swanson and Arnold were in position, Phillips and Wakata remotely controlled the station's robotic arm, maneuvering the truss into its final position. Swanson and Arnold then bolted the truss into place, and connected power and data cables, which allowed the ground team to begin remote activation of the segment. The two spacewalkers also removed launch locks, stowed a keel pin, removed and jettisoned four thermal covers, and deployed the blanket boxes that hold the solar arrays in place during launch. The spacewalk ended at 21:11 UTC, for a total time of 6 hours, 7 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Southern Death Cult {{reformed}} as the Cult, a {{more conventional}} hard rock group. In <b>their</b> <b>wake,</b> the Mission, which included two {{former members of the}} Sisters of Mercy, achieved commercial success in the mid-1980s, as did Fields of the Nephilim and All About Eve. Other bands who continue to be associated with gothic rock include Alien Sex Fiend, All Living Fear, And Also the Trees, Balaam and the Angel, Claytown Troupe, Dream Disciples, Feeding Fingers, Inkubus Sukkubus, Libitina, Nosferatu, Rosetta Stone, and Suspiria. The 1990s saw a resurgence of the goth subculture, fueled largely by crossover from the industrial, electronic and metal scenes; and goth culture and aesthetic again worked itself into the mainstream consciousness, inspiring thriving goth music scenes in most cities and notoriety throughout popular culture.|$|E

25|$|Napoleon ordered MacDonald to move {{east from}} Trilport. At 7:00 pm, the emperor {{instructed}} Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty with two divisions of cavalry to march west to capture Montmirail, followed at 3:00 am by Étienne Pierre Sylvestre Ricard's division of Marmont's corps. Ney's Young Guard divisions would move in <b>their</b> <b>wake</b> at 6:00 am while Mortier's Old Guard would march directly from Sézanne to Montmirail. Jean François Leval's division was detached from Oudinot {{and ordered to}} march to Montmirail via La Ferté-Gaucher. Napoleon posted Marmont at Étoges with Joseph Lagrange's division and the I Cavalry Corps. Using his central position, Napoleon hoped to smash Sacken and Yorck while they were isolated from Blücher. Accordingly, he ordered MacDonald to retake Château-Thierry and its vital bridge while Marmont {{kept an eye on}} Blücher.|$|E
25|$|Lütjens' tactics proved {{useful in}} two respects. After the Hood battle, he steamed {{directly}} at his pursuers, forcing them away, while his heavy cruiser escaped out of radar range. On 25 May, his 52nd birthday, despite constant action and exhaustion, {{he ordered a}} clever manoeuvre. He ordered full speed and then a three-quarter clockwise turn once his pursuers had reached the extremis of their radar range. The British cruisers had been performing zigzags to avoid German U-boats they {{believed to be in}} the vicinity. At the outer edge of their port turn, they would be at the limit of their radar's range. This allowed him to escape the enemy radar, steam in the opposite direction, and then once behind them steam across <b>their</b> <b>wake</b> and avoid enemy attempts to regain contact.|$|E
25|$|The Spartan {{forces were}} held up {{for several days}} by Theban forces manning the earthen stockades at the {{perimeter}} of Theban territory.

With {{the fall of the}} stockades, they were left with two choices, either to retreat back to the defensible walls of Thebes or to hold their ground and face the Spartans in the open. They chose the latter and arrayed their forces along the crest of a low sloping hill, opposite the Spartan forces. Gorgidas and the Sacred Band occupied the front ranks of the Theban forces on the right, while Chabrias and an experienced force of mercenary hoplites occupied the front ranks of the Athenian forces on the left.|$|E
