This unit {{was used to}} study the phenomenon of corn cob break-up {{and its effect on}} the performance of the threshing unit. It was found that the degree of corn cob break-up was affected by cylinder peripheral speed, cylinder-concave clearance and hybrid cultivar. Within the hybrid cultivars used, increased cob break-up was associated with decreased shelling efficiency and concave separation efficiency. The possibility of reducing kernel damage and increasing concave separation efficiency by changing some of the concave design parameters was investigated.

The performance characteristics considered are tangential force, feed force and radial force. Grey relational theory is adopted {{to determine the}} best process parameters that give lower magnitude of <b>tangential,</b> <b>feed,</b> radial forces and optimal cutting parameters. An orthogonal array L 18 is used for the experimental design. The setting of process parameters — nose radius, 0. 8 mm; cutting speed, 60. 65 m/min; feed rate, 0. 04 mm/rev; and depth of cut, 0. 60 mm — has highest grey relational grade and therefore produces best turning performance in terms of cutting forces...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultrafiltration}} {{of orange}} and lemon juices {{has been investigated}} on a pilot-plant scale at constant concentration using tubular configuration polymeric and ceramic membranes. The permeate fluxes {{were found to be}} strongly dependent on the <b>tangential</b> <b>feed</b> velocity at the membrane but almost independent of the driving force at average pressures over the membrane greater than ≈ 0. 2 MPa. These results are due to the formation of a pectin-pulp deposit on the membrane, which effectively controls the ultrafiltration. Because of their different surface structures and roughness this deposit has different properties for the ceramic and polymeric membranes. This causes the latter to behave as rough tubes. The ceramic membranes give higher permeate fluxes at a lower Reynolds number than the polymeric membranes. This and their smooth tube behaviour indicate the possibility of greater energy efficiency for the industrial application of the ceramic than of the polymeric membrane...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} develop a coherence function model to describe the behaviour of coherence with tool wear. A cutting tool in turning, typically mounted as a cantilever, is used to explain the model. The dynamic forces that occur during cutting can be resolved into three mutually perpendicular components along the radial, <b>tangential</b> and <b>feed</b> directions. The theory postulated {{that the degree of}} correlation between the dynamic <b>tangential</b> and <b>feed</b> vibration components, measured as acceleration, was inversely related to the rate of tool wear. When the wear rate was high, the correlation was low. Three sets of machining tests were conducted corresponding to the roughing, semi-roughing and finishing conditions. It was observed that for roughing and semi-roughing conditions, in the frequency range of 2. 5 - 5. 5 kHz, the above-mentioned prediction of coherence turned out to be valid; for the finishing condition, there was a greater discrepancy...|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{numerical}} simulation and experimental verification of the predictive force and surface roughness models for turning operations {{have been carried}} out encompassing the domain of cutting conditions recommended in practice. It has been shown that the three force models predicted very similar qualitative and plausible trends in the <b>tangential</b> <b>feed</b> and radial force components as well as chip flow angle with changes in the many operation variables. The experimental testing involved about 500 turning cuts over a wide range of inclination angles, normal rake angles, major cutting edge angles, corner radius, feed and depth of cut. All the qualitative trends in the forces and chip flow angle noted in the simulation studies have been experimentally confirmed for all the three force models for both TiN coated and uncoated tools. The first two force models predictions correlated very well with the experimental results while only reasonable correlation was found with the third (approximate) model. The surface roughness predictive models were found to be adequate for turning with TiN coated HSS tools only while empirical equations were still necessary for reliable estimates of surface roughness for turning with the uncoated HSS tools. This investigation has shown that comprehensive and quantitatively reliable predictive models for the forces, power, chip flow angle and surface roughness can be established from fundamental cutting theory and analysis. In particular, the findings of this investigation provide further evidence in support of the generic nature of the `unified mechanics of cutting approach' to technological performance prediction and the potential of the predictive surface roughness models for machining with coated tools...|$|E

The novel fine coal separator, named as EG(Enhanced Gravity) Float Cell, utilizes a centrifugal field to clean 1 mm x 250 micron size coal, whereas a flotation environment to clean minus 250 micron coal size fraction. Unlike a conventional enhanced gravity concentrator, which rotates to produce a centrifugal field requiring more energy, the EG Float Cell is fed with a <b>tangential</b> <b>feed</b> slurry to generate an enhanced gravity field without any rotating part. A prototype EG Float Cell unit having a maximum diameter of 60 cm (24 inch) was fabricated during the first-half of the project period followed by a series of exploratory tests to make suitable design modification. Test data indicated that there was a significant concentration of coarse heavy materials in the coarse tailings discharge of the EG Float Cell. The increase in weight (%) of 1 mm x 250 micron (16 x 60 mesh) size fraction from 48. 9 % in the feed to 72. 2 % in the coarse tailings discharge and the corresponding increase in the ash content from 56. 9 % to 87. 0 % is indicative of the effectiveness of the enhanced gravity section of the EG Float Cell.

40|$|Abstract. Block {{electrode}} discharge grinding is {{an effective}} approach to produce micro rods. However, {{it is difficult to}} fabricate the rods into desired miniature and precision. To solve this problem, the <b>tangential</b> <b>feeding</b> method is proposed to control the finish size of micro rods. With this method, the micro rod is first fed in its radial direction, and then in the tangential direction for an enough distance. The wear of the block electrode decreases gradually from the start to the end, and the wear in the end can be neglected. Experiments indicate that the large capacitance or voltage can obtain high machining speed, while the small ones can gain thin micro rods. Based on this result, the policy of delaminating grinding is adopted to gain enough thin micro rods at a high machining speed. The Φ 5 µm micro rods can be ground with this method.

40|$|Development and {{investigations}} of electric arc plasma generators operating with alternating current of commercial frequency {{have been carried}} out in the former USSR. These investigations show that the use of multiphase systems with relatively short high-current arcs is quite efficient because these systems are more stable. In addition, the presence of several arcs in the same chamber facilitates repeated ignition, improves the steady-state operation of the plasma generators and their energetic ratings. Application of multiphase systems enables the voltage drop to be reduced across the arc and this fact leads, in turn, to development of a compact high-power system for operation in steady-state and short-term operating conditions during the relatively low power supply voltage. At the same time this power level generates a relatively high flow rate of the working gas. Different types of these generators have been developed for operating from the AC commercial frequency network.

Mathematical models, which can predict the machining performances, namely, chip-tool interface temperature, cutting forces and surface roughness were developed based on experimental observations. Effect of workpiece hardness and cutting parameters, namely, cutting speed, depth of cut and feed on different responses were analyzed by performing ANOVA technique. Experimental observations indicate higher cutting forces, higher chip-tool interface temperature and lower values of surface roughness for harder workpiece. Feed value has been observed to have more prominent effect on surface roughness. However, the average chip-tool interface temperature has been observed to get more influenced with cutting speed and depth of cut.

40|$|It is {{important}} to maintain a uniform distribution of gas and liquid in large diameter packed columns to maintain mass transfer efficiency on scaling up. This work presents measurements and methods of evaluating maldistributed gas flow in packed columns. Little or no previous {{work has been done}} in this field. A gas maldistribution number, F, was defined, based on point to point velocity variations in the gas emerging from the top of packed beds. f has a minimum value for a uniformly distributed flow and much larger values for maldistributed flows. A method of testing the quality of vapour distributors is proposed, based on "the variation of f with packed height. A good gas distributor requires a short packed depth to give a good gas distribution. Measurements of gas maldistribution have shown that the principle of dynamic similarity is satisfied if two geometrically similar beds are operated at the same Reynold's number. The validity of f as a good measure of gas maldistribution, and the principle of dynamic similarity are tested statistically by Multi-Factor Analysis of the variance, and visually by the response "surfaces technique. Pressure distribution has been measured in a model of a large diameter packed bed, and shown {{to be associated with the}} velocity of the gas in a <b>tangential</b> <b>feed</b> pipe. Two simplified theoretical models are proposed to describe the flow of gases through packed beds and to support the principle of dynamic similarity. These models explain why the packed bed itself causes the flow of gas to become more uniformly distributed. A 1. 2 m. diameter scaled-down model was constructed geometrically similar to a 7. 3 m. diameter vacuum crude distillation column. The previously known internal cylinder gas distributor was tested. Three new distributors suitable for use in a large diameter column were developed and tested, these are: Internal Cylinder with Slots and Cross Baffles, Internal Cylinder with Guides in the Annulus, Internal Cylinder with Internal Cross Baffles - It has been shown that this is an excellent distributor...|$|E
40|$|In the {{machining}} industry, {{there is a}} constant need to increase productivity while also maintaining dimensional tolerances and good surface quality. For many classical machining operations (e. g. milling, turning, and broaching), research has been established that is able to predict the part quality based on process parameters, workpiece material, and the machine’s dynamic characteristics. This allows process planners to design their programs virtually to maximize productivity while meeting the specified part quality. To accomplish this, it is necessary to predict the cutting forces during {{the machining}} operation. This can be done using analytical equations for a lot of operations; however, in more recent research for complicated processes (e. g. 5 -axis milling, gear hobbing), this is done by calculating the cutter-workpiece engagement with geometric CAD modellers and calculating incremental cutting forces along the cutting edge. With knowledge of the cutting forces, static deflections and dynamic vibrations of the tool and workpiece can be calculated {{which is one of the}} most prominent contributors to dimensional part inaccuracies and poor surface quality in machining. The research presented in this thesis aims to achieve similar goals for the gear shaping process. Gear shaping is one of the most prominent methods of machining cylindrical gears. More specifically, it is the most prominent method for generating internal gears which are a major component in planetary gear boxes. The gear shaping process uses a modified external gear as a cutting tool which reciprocates up and down to cut the teeth in the workpiece. Simultaneously, the tool and workpiece are also rotating proportionally to their gear ratio which emulate the rolling of two gears. During the beginning of each gear shaping pass, the tool is radially fed into the workpiece until the desired depth of cut is reached. In this study, the three kinematic components (reciprocating feed, rotary feed, and radial feed) are mathematically modelled using analytical equations and experimentally verified using captured CNC signals from the controller of a Liebherr LSE 500 gear shaping machine. To predict cutting forces in gear shaping, the cutter-workpiece engagement (CWE) is calculated at discrete time steps using a discrete solid modeller called ModuleWorks. From the CWE in dexel form, the two-dimensional chip geometry is reconstructed using Delaunay triangulation and alpha shape reconstruction which is then used to determine the undeformed chip area along the cutting edge. The cutting edge is discretized into nodes with varying cutting directions (<b>tangential,</b> <b>feed,</b> and radial), inclination angle, and rake angle. If engaged in cutting during a time step, each node contributes an incremental three dimensional force vector calculated with the oblique cutting force model. Using a 3 -axis dynamometer, the cutting force prediction algorithm was experimentally verified on a variety of processes and gears which included an internal spur gear, external spur gear, and external helical gear. The simulated and measured force profiles correlate very closely (about 3 - 10 % RMS error) with the most error occurring in the external helical gear case. These errors may be attributable due to rubbing of the tool which is evident through visible gouges on the finished workpiece, tool wear on the helical gear shaper, and different cutting speed than the process for which the cutting coefficients were calibrated. More experiments are needed to verify the sources of error in the helical gear case. To simulate elastic tool deflection in gear shaping, the tool’s static stiffness is estimated from impact hammer testing. Then, based on the predicted cutting force, the elastic deflection of the tool is calculated at each time step. To examine the affect of tool deflection on the final quality of the gear, a virtual gear measurement module is developed and used to predict the involute profile deviations in the virtually machined part. Simulated and measured profile deviations were compared for a one-pass external spur gear process and a two-pass external spur gear process. The simulated profile errors correlate very well with the measured profiles on the left flank of the workpiece, however additional research is needed to improve the accuracy of the model on the right flank. Furthermore, the model also serves as a basis for future research in dyamic vibrations in gear shaping. The above-mentioned algorithms have been implemented into a tool called ShapePRO (developed in C++). The software is meant for process planners to be able to simulate the gear shaping operation virtually and inspect the resulting quality of the gear. Accordingly, the user may iterate the process parameters to maximize productivity while meeting the customer’s desired gear quality...|$|E

A set of equations relating the <b>tangential</b> and <b>feed</b> {{forces to the}} tool edge width and feed rate (chip thickness) to calculate the chip and edge cutting force coefficients was developed. Then the chip force and edge force coefficients were calculated from experimentally obtained cutting forces and were plotted in a polar-coordinate system {{with respect to the}} fiber orientation of the maple disk. The polar-coordinate presentation of the cutting force results and the calculated cutting force coefficients provides an excellent visual appreciation of the relation between the cutting forces and the wood fiber orientation. Chips were also collected from various sectors of the wood disk. This analysis further identified the effects of fiber orientation and cutting forces on the types of chip formed and hence the cutting mechanics involved.

Clusters (M_ 200 >= 10 ^ 14 Msol) reproduce previous results with thermal pressure responsible for ~ 90 % of the support against gravity, but this fraction drops for group-sized haloes (M_ 200 ~ 10 ^ 13 Msol) and is even lower (40 - 70 %) for L* haloes between 0. 1 - 0. 3 R_ 200. Energy from feedback grows relative to the binding energy of a halo toward lower mass resulting in greater deviations from HSE. Tangential motions comprise the largest deviation from HSE in L* haloes indicating that the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) has significant sub- centrifugal rotation and angular momentum spin parameters 2 - 3 x higher than the dark matter spin parameters. Thermal feedback can buoyantly rise to the outer CGM of M_ 200 < 10 ^ 12 Msol haloes, both moving baryons beyond R_ 200 and <b>feeding</b> uncorrelated <b>tangential</b> motions. The resulting hot halo density and rotation profiles show promising agreement with X-ray observations of the inner Milky Way halo, and we discuss future observational prospects to detect spinning hot haloes around other galaxies.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The main aim {{of this research is}} to develop an on-line tool wear condition monitoring intelligent system for single-point turning operations. This is to provide accurate and reliable information on the different states of tool wear. Calibrated acoustic emission and vibration techniques were implemented to monitor the progress of wear on carbide tool tips. Previous research has shown that acoustic emission (AE) is sensitive to tool wear. However, AE, as a monitoring technique, is still not widely adopted by industry. This is because it is as yet impossible to achieve repeatable measurements of AE. The variability is due to inconsistent coupling of the sensor with structures {{and the fact that the}} tool structure may have different geometry and material property. Calibration is therefore required so that the extent of variability becomes quantifiable, and hence accounted for or removed altogether. Proper calibration needs a well-defined and repeatable AE source. In this research, various artificial sources were reviewed in order to assess their suitability as an AE calibration source for the single-point machining process. Two artificial sources were selected for studying in detail. These are an air jet and a pulsed laser; the former produces continuous-type AE and the latter burst type AE. Since the air jet source has a power spectrum resembling closely the AE produced from single-point machining and since it is readily available in a machine shop, not to mention its relative safety compared to laser, an air-jet source is a more appealing choice. The calibration procedure involves setting up an air jet at a fixed stand-off distance from the top rake of the tool tip, applying in sequence a set of increasing pressures and measuring the corresponding AE. It was found that the root-mean-square value of the AE obtained is linearly proportional to the pressure applied. Thus, irrespective of the layout of the sensor and AE source in a tool structure, AE can be expressed in terms of the common currency of 'pressure' using the calibration curve produced for that particular layout. Tool wear stages can then be defined in terms of the 'pressure' levels. In order to improve the robustness of the monitoring system, in addition to AE, vibration information is also used. In this case, the acceleration at the tool tip in the <b>tangential</b> and <b>feed</b> directions is measured. The coherence function between these two signals is then computed. The coherence is a function of the vibration frequency and has a value ranging from 0 to 1, corresponding to no correlation and full correlation respectively between the two acceleration signals. The coherence function method is an attempt to provide a solution, which is relatively insensitive to the dynamics and the process variables except tool wear. Three features were identified to be sensitive to tool wear and they are; AErms, and the coherence function of the acceleration at natural frequency (2. 5 - 5. 5 kHz) of the tool holder and at high frequency end (18 - 25 kHz) respectively. A belief network, based on Bayes' rule, was created providing fusion of data from AE and vibration for tool wear classification. The conditional probabilities required for the belief network to operate were established from examples. These examples were presented to the belief network as a file of cases. The file contains the three features mentioned earlier, together with cutting conditions and the tool wear states. Half of the data in this file was used for training while the other half was used for testing the network. The performance of the network gave an overall classification error rate of 1. 6 % with the WD acoustic emission sensor and an error rate of 4. 9 % with the R 30 acoustic emission sensor. Funding was obtained from The Royal Thai Government, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand and King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT...|$|R
