5|$|Another rare {{complication}} {{that may}} occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is purple toe syndrome. This condition is thought to result from small deposits of cholesterol breaking loose and causing embolisms in blood vessels in <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feet, which causes a blueish purple colour and may be painful.|$|E

5|$|As {{noted by}} Arthur M. Greenhall:If there is fur on <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> host, the common vampire bat uses its canine and cheek teeth like a barber's blades to shave away the hairs. The bat's razor-sharp upper incisor teeth {{then make a}} 7mm wide and 8mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them {{permanently}} razor sharp. Their teeth are so sharp, even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts.|$|E
5|$|King {{vultures}}, which {{lack the}} ability to smell carrion, follow the greater yellow-headed vultures to carcasses, where the king vulture tears open <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead animal. This allows the smaller greater yellow-headed vulture access to food, as {{it does not have}} a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example of mutual dependence between species. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both turkey vultures and king vultures, due to their larger size.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 2015, Lapierre {{was traded}} from the Blues to the Pittsburgh Penguins in {{exchange}} for Marcel Goc. Lapierre {{played a key role}} during the 2015 playoffs, getting under <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New York Rangers by drawing penalties, instigating fights, taunting and most notably doing play-by-play towards the Rangers' bench. He played an important role on the face-off dot and on the penalty kill, frustrating the New York Rangers and his former head coach in Vancouver, Alain Vigneault.|$|E

6000|$|Not {{many minutes}} were {{required}} for <b>the</b> <b>skinning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bear. When it was done, it, {{along with all}} the scattered things, was placed in the canoe, and then Redhand, approaching the artist, touched his cap and said-- ...|$|R
5|$|The cap is chestnut, rusty, olive brown, or {{dark brown}} {{in color and}} {{generally}} 4–10cm (rarely to 13cm) in diameter at maturity. The cap has a distinctive conical shape, later flattening out. It is slimy to the touch, bare, smooth, and glossy even when dry, and the cuticle is easily peeled off. The tiny, circular pores of the tubes are initially yellow but turn olive to dark yellow with maturity. Like <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap, they can be readily peeled away from the flesh.|$|E
5|$|The condor's {{head and}} neck have few feathers, and <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{head and neck}} is capable of {{flushing}} noticeably in response to emotional state, a capability that can serve as communication between individuals. The skin color varies from yellowish to a glowing reddish-orange. The birds do not have true syringeal vocalizations. They can make a few hissing or grunting sounds only heard when very close.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adult {{cane toad}} is toxic, {{as well as}} the {{enlarged}} parotoid glands behind the eyes, and other glands across their backs. When the toads are threatened, their glands secrete a milky-white fluid known as bufotoxin. Components of bufotoxin are toxic to many animals; even human deaths have been recorded due to the consumption of cane toads.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{cane toad}} is dry and warty. It has {{distinct}} ridges above the eyes, which {{run down the}} snout. Individual cane toads can be grey, yellowish, red-brown, or olive-brown, with varying patterns. A large parotoid gland lies behind each eye. The ventral surface is cream-coloured and may have blotches in shades of black or brown. The pupils are horizontal and the irises golden. The toes have a fleshy webbing at their base, and the fingers are free of webbing.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses {{reported}} {{that as the}} plane approached Detroit, Abdulmutallab went into the plane's lavatory for about 20 minutes. After returning to his seat at 19A (near the fuel tanks and wing, and against <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plane), he complained {{that he had an}} upset stomach. He was seen pulling a blanket over himself.|$|E
5|$|A hamster {{in captivity}} can {{occasionally}} eat mealworms or earthworms, which have high protein contents. Boiled {{egg whites and}} small pieces of clean, cooked chicken are also sources of extra protein. They can also eat wheat grain, sunflower seeds, and locusts. The teeth of Campbell's dwarf hamster never stop growing. Like all rodents, they must therefore gnaw regularly to keep their incisors from growing into <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth and causing pain and irritation. Smooth, young wood from nontoxic trees, such as apple and willow, is readily used by most species in the genus. Most pet stores sell nontoxic wooden chews designed for rodents in captivity.|$|E

First, in <b>the</b> brown <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ripe pip, we might imagine {{we saw the}} part {{correspondent}} to <b>the</b> mahogany <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chestnut, and therefore <b>the</b> inner coat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {224} husk. But it is not so. <b>The</b> brown <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pips belongs to them properly, and is all their own. It is <b>the</b> true <b>skin</b> or sack <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seed. <b>The</b> inner coat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> husk is the smooth, white, scaly part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core that holds them.|$|R

5|$|Aeronautical {{engineering}} {{firms were}} quick {{to respond to the}} Comet's commercial advantages and technical flaws alike; other aircraft manufacturers learned from, and profited by, the hard-earned lessons embodied by de Havilland's Comet. While the Comet's buried engines were used on some other early jet airliners, such as the Tupolev Tu-104, later aircraft, such as the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, would differ by employing podded engines held on pylons beneath the wings. Boeing stated that podded engines were selected for their passenger airliners because buried engines carried a higher risk of catastrophic wing failure in the event of engine fire. In response to the Comet tragedies, manufacturers also developed various means of pressurisation testing, often {{going so far as to}} explore rapid depressurisation; subsequent fuselage skins were of a greater thickness than <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Comet.|$|E
5|$|During the Postclassic period, {{the most}} common form of human {{sacrifice}} was heart extraction, influenced by the method used by the Aztecs in the Valley of Mexico; this usually took place in the courtyard of a temple, or upon the summit of the pyramid. Depending upon the exact ritual, sometimes the corpse would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet. The officiating priest would then remove his ritual attire and dress himself in <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sacrificial victim before performing a ritual dance that symbolized the rebirth of life. Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by fluoroscopy and feedback from the patient, and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they {{are attached to the}} snugly fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of cancer pain.|$|E
