5|$|When Beria told Stalin {{about the}} Manhattan Project and its {{importance}} Stalin handpicked Molotov to be <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the Soviet atomic bomb project. However, under Molotov's leadership the bomb, {{and the project}} itself, developed very slowly and Molotov was replaced by Beria in 1944 {{on the advice of}} Igor Kurchatov. When Harry S. Truman, the American president, told Stalin that the Americans had created a bomb never seen before, Stalin relayed the conversation to Molotov and told him to speed up development. On Stalin's orders the Soviet government substantially increased investment in the project.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{probably}} {{retained its}} form as established by 1100 until {{the reign of}} Richard the Lionheart (1189–1199). The castle was extended under William Longchamp, King Richard's Lord Chancellor and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of England {{while he was on}} crusade. The Pipe Rolls record £2,881 1s 10d spent at the Tower of London between 3 December 1189 and 11 November 1190, from an estimated £7,000 spent by Richard on castle building in England. According to the contemporary chronicler Roger of Howden, Longchamp dug a moat around the castle and tried in vain to fill it from the Thames. Longchamp was also Constable of the Tower, and undertook its expansion while preparing for war with King Richard's younger brother, Prince John, who in Richard's absence arrived in England to try to seize power. As Longchamp's main fortress, he made the Tower as strong as possible. The new fortifications were first tested in October 1191, when the Tower was besieged {{for the first time in}} its history. Longchamp capitulated to John after just three days, deciding he had more to gain from surrender than prolonging the siege.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Doom 3 is {{conveyed}} through in-game dialogue and cut scenes, {{as well as}} e-mails, audio logs and video files found throughout the game. The game opens with UAC board member Elliott Swann and his bodyguard Jack Campbell arriving at Mars City, the main access to the UAC's Mars base, disembarking from an Earth transport, with the player's anonymous marine just behind them. Swann and Campbell, here to investigate multiple incidents, have a heated conference meeting with <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the Mars laboratories, Dr. Malcolm Betruger while the marine heads to Master Sergeant Thomas Kelly for orders. Kelly gives the marine instructions to find a scientist from the Delta Labs who has gone missing. The marine finds the scientist in a nearby decommissioned communications facility, where he is frantically trying to send a warning to the UAC on Earth about Betruger's teleportation experiments. However, {{as he tries to}} explain the situation to the marine, another teleportation test takes place and loses containment, at which point the entire Mars base is swept with an unnatural shockwave. This transforms most of the base's personnel into zombies as the forces of Hell invade through the teleporter's portal.|$|E
5|$|Zutphen was {{strategically}} {{important to}} Farnese, as it allowed his troops to levy war {{contributions in the}} rich Veluwe region. Therefore, he left some troops blockading Rheinberg and marched to relieve the town. He personally supplied Zutphen at first, but as the Anglo-Dutch siege continued, he assembled a large convoy whose delivery to the town he entrusted to the Alfonso Félix de Ávalos Aquino y Gonzaga, Marquis del Vasto/Guasto. Leicester learned of this when a courier dispatched by Farnese to Francisco Verdugo, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of Zutphen, was intercepted. The English and Dutch prepared an ambush, in which many English knights and noblemen were involved. In the end, the Spanish succeeded in delivering the convoy safely to Zutphen after a hard-fought battle. The Spanish cavalry, composed mainly of Italian and Albanian soldiers, was defeated by the English cavalry under the Earl of Essex. The Spanish infantry, however, held its ground and delivered the convoy to Zutphen. From there, reinforced by Verdugo, the Spanish troops forced the English to retreat.|$|E
