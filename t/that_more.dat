5|$|A {{beaked whale}} is any {{of at least}} 22 species of small whale in the family Ziphiidae. They {{are one of the}} least-known {{families}} of large mammals: several species have only been described in the last two decades, and it is entirely possible <b>that</b> <b>more</b> remain as yet undiscovered. Six genera have been identified.|$|E
5|$|A {{new church}} was needed because the old church needed {{significant}} repair {{and also because}} the growth of Brynsiencyn meant <b>that</b> <b>more</b> people lived there than in Llanidan itself. Like its predecessor, it is dedicated to Nidan, a 7th-century Welsh saint who was the confessor of the monastery at Penmon, on the eastern tip of Anglesey.|$|E
5|$|A production–possibility {{frontier}} (PPF) or {{production possibility}} curve (PPC) is a graphical representation of possible combinations of two goods (such as butter and guns) {{that can be}} produced with constant technology and resources per unit of time, such <b>that</b> <b>more</b> of one good could be produced only by diverting resources from the other good, resulting in less production of it; i. e. production tradeoffs, usually for an economy, but which can also be interpreted as applying for an individual, household, etc.|$|E

5|$|A working {{knowledge}} of English has become a requirement {{in a number of}} occupations and professions such as medicine and computing. English has become so important in scientific publishing <b>that</b> <b>more</b> than 80 percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by Chemical Abstracts in 1998 were written in English, as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995.|$|E
5|$|According to Michel Beluet, {{the former}} {{director}} of a Raëlian-built museum called UFOland, the only pressure exerted on members is to attend annual Raëlian seminars, which allows members convinced of Raël's enthusiasm to voluntarily tithe. Palmer cited Raël, who claimed <b>that</b> <b>more</b> than 60% of the Raëlian Movement's members do not tithe. Dawson College students conducted a survey of the membership in Canada 1991 which found that only one-third of respondents tithed.|$|E
5|$|Ancient sources present {{disparate}} casualty {{figures for}} the Battle of Issus. Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus approximate 100,000 Persian deaths, {{in contrast with the}} 450 Macedonian deaths reported by Quintus Curtius Rufus. In any case, it is probable <b>that</b> <b>more</b> Persians were killed as they fled than in battle; Ptolemy I, who served with Alexander during the battle, recounts how the Macedonians crossed a ravine on the bodies of their enemies during the pursuit.|$|E

5|$|Arctic terns are {{long-lived}} {{birds that}} spend considerable time raising {{only a few}} young, and are thus said to be K-selected. The bird has life span that was thought be around 20 years, however National Geographic, The University of Alberta & Massachusetts Institute of Technology, concluded in 2010 <b>that</b> <b>more</b> than 50% of this species will live past their 30th birthday. A study in the Farne Islands estimated an annual survival rate of 82%.|$|E

Worldwide, twomillion units were sold in its first week from {{approximately}} 4.6million shipped units, compared to Arkham Asylums 4.3million units sold in its entire release. On February 8, 2012, it was announced <b>that</b> <b>more</b> than sixmillion units of the game had been shipped since release.|$|E
5|$|Because the hot recycle solids are heated in a {{separate}} furnace, the oil shale gas from these technologies is not diluted with combustion exhaust gas. Another advantage {{is that there is}} no limit on the smallest particles that the retort can process, thus allowing all the crushed feed to be used. One disadvantge is <b>that</b> <b>more</b> water is used to handle the resulting finer shale ash.|$|E

5|$|Bush became {{dissatisfied}} with Colonel Marshall's failure {{to get the}} project moving forward expeditiously, specifically the failure to acquire the Tennessee site, the low priority allocated to the project by the Army {{and the location of}} his headquarters in New York City. Bush felt <b>that</b> <b>more</b> aggressive leadership was required, and spoke to Harvey Bundy and Generals Marshall, Somervell, and Styer about his concerns. He wanted the project placed under a senior policy committee, with a prestigious officer, preferably Styer, as overall director.|$|E

5|$|Carbon {{can form}} very long chains of {{interconnecting}} carbon–carbon bonds, a property {{that is called}} catenation. Carbon-carbon bonds are strong and stable. Through catenation, carbon forms a countless number of compounds. A tally of unique compounds shows <b>that</b> <b>more</b> contain carbon that those that do not. A similar claim {{can be made for}} hydrogen because most organic compounds also contain hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of {{parabolic}} mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This {{has the advantage}} that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and <b>that</b> <b>more</b> reflectors can {{be placed in the}} same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} studies demonstrating {{the central role}} of ammonia, ammonia levels do not always correlate with the severity of the encephalopathy; it is suspected that this means <b>that</b> <b>more</b> ammonia has already been absorbed into the brain in those with severe symptoms whose serum levels are relatively low. Other waste products implicated in hepatic encephalopathy include mercaptans (substances containing a thiol group), short-chain fatty acids, and phenol.|$|E

5|$|Feeding {{is usually}} {{in small groups}} and the bird takes mainly insects. Breeding usually starts in March, with the birds {{building}} their nest high in an acacia tree. The birds usually lay five to six cream eggs with lilac blotches. The nest itself is globular in shape with a tubular entrance on top. It is possible <b>that</b> <b>more</b> than just the breeding pair visit the nest and that the young of previous years help in rearing the young.|$|E
5|$|His name {{also appears}} on several mud seal {{impressions}} found at Quesna (in the Delta), Zawyet el'Aryan, Hierakonpolis, and Elephantine.

These seal impressions bear more inscriptions than the stone bowls, however most of the seals are only preserved as small fragments and their surfaces have been roughened over the years.|$|E
