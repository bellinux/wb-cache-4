5|$|About 20% are {{affected}} by symptomatic digestive tract lesions, although a higher percentage have lesions that do not cause symptoms. These lesions may bleed intermittently, which is rarely significant enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>noticed</b> (in the form of bloody vomiting or black stool), but can eventually lead to depletion of iron in the body, resulting in iron-deficiency anemia.|$|E
5|$|Jack Verge went to Sydney University in 1900 and for {{the first}} two years played fullback for the University second rugby team. In his second year, he began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>noticed</b> by the rugby press, both for his {{defensive}} play and kicking skills. In the July 1901 match between University II and Balmain II, Verge scored two tries, and was then selected to play for the New South Wales (NSW) second team.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his play in the Extraliga, Walker began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>noticed</b> by the National Hockey League (NHL). In the NHL Central Scouting Bureau's January 2012 list of draft {{prospects}}, Walker was listed as the 21st best European-based skater for the 2012 NHL Entry Draft, the second highest Czech-based player on the list. Walker was listed as the 25th best European skater in the NHL's final list of prospects for the 2012 Entry Draft. He was not selected in the Entry Draft, but was {{invited to participate in the}} Washington Capitals development camp in July; however NHL rules required that Walker participate in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft before he was able to sign with any team.|$|E

5|$|As the Mozarts began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>noticed</b> by the Viennese aristocracy, {{they were}} often {{required}} to give several performances during a single day. They were well rewarded for this activityat {{the end of their}} first hectic week in Vienna, Leopold was able to send home the equivalent of more than two years' salary. Their schedule was interrupted when Wolfgang fell ill with scarlet fever, and their former momentum was not regained. Nevertheless, the visit left Leopold eager to pursue further opportunities for social and financial success. On their return to Salzburg, Wolfgang played the harpsichord and violin at a birthday concert for the Archbishop, to the evident astonishment of those present.|$|E
5|$|Most known Albertosaurus {{individuals}} were aged 14 {{years or more}} {{at the time of}} death. Juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons, mainly preservation bias, where the smaller bones of younger animals {{were less likely to be}} preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults, and collection bias, where smaller fossils are less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>noticed</b> by collectors in the field. Young Albertosaurus are relatively large for juvenile animals, but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults. It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of life history, rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile Albertosaurus are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms of Huntington's disease most {{commonly}} become noticeable {{between the ages}} of 35 and 44years, but they can begin at any age from infancy to old age. In the early stages, there are subtle changes in personality, cognition, and physical skills. The physical symptoms are usually the first <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>noticed,</b> as cognitive and behavioral symptoms are generally not severe enough to be recognized on their own at the earlier stages. Almost everyone with Huntington's disease eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but the onset, progression and extent of cognitive and behavioral symptoms vary significantly between individuals.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} {{was set in}} a dystopian future {{controlled}} by Cyber-cops (referred to as such by director Brett Leonard.) It depicted an individual who records the Cyber-cops beating a man, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>noticed</b> and attacked himself. His camera is destroyed and the Cyber-cops leave him unconscious on the ground, as they are busy trying to put down a riot elsewhere in the city. Alone, his camera equipment lands on him and is absorbed into his body, causing him to dramatically morph into a cyborg. The cyborg then joins the riot, leading the rebels to victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} design {{was a simple}} solid plug filled with a slug of low-melting-point alloy. When this melts, it first melts as a narrow channel through the plug. Steam and water immediately begins to escape through this. The cored fusible plug {{was developed in the}} 1860s to give a wide opening as soon as the alloy softens. This version has a solid brass or bronze centre, soldered into place by a layer of the low-melting-point alloy. When overheated, the plug does not release any steam or water until the alloy melts sufficiently to release the centre plug. The plug now fails dramatically, opening its entire bore immediately. This full-bore jet is then more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>noticed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Approximately once a decade, a comet becomes {{bright enough}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>noticed</b> by a casual observer, leading such comets to be {{designated}} as great comets. Predicting whether a comet {{will become a}} great comet is notoriously difficult, as many factors may cause a comet's brightness to depart drastically from predictions. Broadly speaking, if a comet has a large and active nucleus, will pass close to the Sun, and is not obscured by the Sun {{as seen from the}} Earth when at its brightest, it has a chance of becoming a great comet. However, Comet Kohoutek in 1973 fulfilled all the criteria and was expected to become spectacular but failed to do so. Comet West, which appeared three years later, had much lower expectations but became an extremely impressive comet.|$|E

25|$|<b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>noticed,</b> {{different}} {{national parks}} offer different biodiversity, {{as the natural}} habitat in Indonesia {{is divided into two}} areas by the Wallace line.

25|$|As {{a result}} of his {{humanitarian}} efforts, Romero began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>noticed</b> internationally. In February 1980, he was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Louvain. On his visit to Europe to receive this honor, he met Pope John Paul II and expressed his concern at what was happening in his country. Romero argued that it was problematic to support the Salvadoran government because it legitimized terror and assassinations.|$|E
25|$|Observers of {{the primary}} and general {{elections}} compared Obama's design choices favorably to those made by his opponents. In her campaign, Hillary Clinton used New Baskerville, a serif used by book publishers, law firms, and universities, while John McCain used Optima, the same font used for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. It also has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>noticed</b> that while the Obama campaign material still used the Perpetua typeface, the short-lived John Edwards campaign was already using Gotham Ultra.|$|E

25|$|Lind's {{work was}} slow <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>noticed,</b> partly because his Treatise was not {{published}} until {{six years after}} his study, and also because he recommended a lemon juice extract known as rob. Fresh fruit was very expensive to keep on board, whereas boiling it down to juice allowed easy storage but destroyed the vitamin (especially if boiled in copper kettles). Ship captains concluded wrongly that Lind's other suggestions were ineffective because those juices failed to prevent or cure scurvy.|$|E
25|$|The East Slavic {{languages}} {{originated in}} the language spoken in Rus. Significant differences in spoken language in different regions began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>noticed</b> after {{the division of the}} Rus lands between the Golden Horde (from about 1240) and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Lithuania eventually allied with the Kingdom of Poland in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Muscovites under the Golden Horde developed the modern Russian language, people in the northern Lithuanian sector developed Belorussian, and in the southern Polish sector Ukrainian.|$|E

25|$|Several of Ayckbourn's {{observations}} about celebrity culture have obvious influences in the play.

He also suggested that in an age of increasing anonymity, some are increasingly desperate <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>noticed.</b> The play also follows the theory that when one quickly rises to the top, one can fall just as quickly and mercilessly.|$|E
25|$|A diver who has {{deployed}} a Delayed Surface Marker Buoy (DSMB) {{at the end}} of a dive may use a pre-arranged {{colour code}} to indicate if there is a problem.
