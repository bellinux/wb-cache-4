30|$|Some caveats are {{in order}} in {{interpreting}} these results. First, the Blanchard-Katz methodology followed in this paper and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>identifies</b> migration flows as a residual. The changes in employment that are not explained by changes in unemployment and inactivity are due {{to changes in the}} working-age population. Changes in the working-age population that occur in response to labour demand shocks are, in turn, attributed to labour mobility. This method has been devised to circumvent situations in which net migration rates are not available or not sufficiently reliable. In the case of the EU, the available data series “Crude rate of net migration plus statistical adjustment” includes the effects of revisions of population projections by national statistical authorities. Thus, the time series includes a number of revisions and outliers, which makes its time series properties less than ideal (see Additional file 1 on data sources on migration in the EU).|$|R

5000|$|Old High German had schrat, scrato or scrazo, {{which appear}} in glosses of Latin works as {{translations}} for fauni, silvestres, or pilosi, identifying the creatures as hairy woodland beings.

Common in Lombardy and the Italian-speaking parts of the Alps is the term salvan or salvang, which derives from the Latin Silvanus, {{the name of the}} Roman tutelary god of gardens and the countryside. Similarly, folklore in Tyrol and German-speaking Switzerland into the 20th century included a wild woman known as Fange or Fanke, which derives from the Latin fauna, the feminine form of faun. Medieval German sources give as names for the wild woman lamia and holzmoia (or some variation); the former clearly refers to the Greek wilderness demon Lamia while the latter derives ultimately from Maia, a Greco-Roman earth and fertility goddess who is <b>elsewhere</b> <b>identified</b> with Fauna and who exerted a wide influence on medieval wild-man lore.Slavic has leshy [...] "forest man".|$|R
5000|$|Within a {{few years}} of the site's discovery, a 1982 report noted that it had yielded more than seventy fluted points (<b>elsewhere</b> <b>identified</b> as Clovis points), which the report's authors {{declared}} made it an example of [...] "unusual size and complexity". Such large sites as Adams County, or [...] "Sandy Springs" [...] as it is also known, are rare among Paleo-Indian sites; most discoveries related to the people are isolated finds, although a comparable archaeological district known as the Welling Site has been discovered in Coshocton County, Ohio. It appears that southern Adams County was highly significant for such primitive peoples because of its geology: one of Ohio's few regions with combined shale and limestone bedrock, the Sandy Springs area is geologically similar to the Kentucky Bluegrass, making it a natural migration route for herds of animals roaming the Bluegrass. As a result, Paleo-Indian hunters learned to use the area to watch for and ambush large herds of animals, which would have been travelling slowly due to the large river.|$|R

We critically reviewed the few previously published methods to detect changes in movement behavior likely to occur when an animal enters a profitable place. As all of them appeared to be too narrowly tuned to specific situations, we designed a new, easy-to-use method based on the time spent in the vicinity of successive path locations. We used computer simulations to show that our method is both quite general and robust to noisy data...|$|R

50|$|The army {{arrives in}} Italy and easily conquers Verona. Dietrich then moves to face Ermenrich's {{enormous}} army at Ravenna, ordering Etzel's sons and Diether {{to stay in}} Verona under the watch of Ilsan (<b>elsewhere</b> <b>identified</b> as Hildebrand's brother). The army marches to Verona in a thick fog, led by Hildebrand. The children, under the pretext of wishing to view the city, convince Ilsan {{to let them go}} riding - they then escape their protector with the intention of joining the army, but get lost in the fog. Very soon they came upon Witige riding along the seashore. Despite his protestation, the children attack Witige and are slain. Meanwhile, Dietrich fights a grueling twelve-day battle at Ravenna, defeating Ermenrich, who escapes. Then Ilsan arrives with news that Etzel's sons are missing, and Dietrich finds their bodies on the seashore. He quickly encounters Witige and challenges him to fight. Witige, however, is afraid, and flees Dietrich by riding his horse Schemming into the sea, where he is rescued by the sea-spirit Wachilt (identified by the Thidrekssaga as his great grandmother). She tells him that Dietrich was so hot with anger that his armor was soft, and Witige could have easily defeated him. Now, however, the armor had hardened, and thirty Witiges could not defeat Dietrich. Dietrich meanwhile mourns on the shore. With the help of Rüdiger, he affects a reconciliation with Helche and Etzel, and all vow revenge.|$|R

5000|$|The Wessex royal {{pedigree}} {{continued to}} puzzle historians until, in 1953, Anglo-Saxon scholar Kenneth Sisam presented an analysis {{that has since}} been almost universally accepted by historians. He noted similarities between the earlier versions of the Wessex pedigree and that of Ida. Those appearing in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and in the published transcript of Asser (the original having been lost in an 18th-century fire) are in agreement but several earlier manuscript transcripts of Asser's work give, instead, the shorter pedigree of the later Anglian collection manuscripts, probably representing the original text of Asser and the earliest form of the Cerdic pedigree. Sisam speculated that the additional names arose through the insertion {{of a pair of}} Saxon heroes, Freawine and Wig, into the existing pedigree, creating a second alliterative pair (after Brand/Bældæg, Giwis/Wig, where the stress of [...] "Giwis" [...] is on the second sylable) and inviting further alliteration, the addition of Esla to complete an Elesa/Esla pair, and of Friðgar to make a Freawine/Friðgar alliteration. Of these alliterative names (in a culture whose poetry depended upon alliteration rather than rhyme) only Esla is perhaps known elsewhere: British historians working before Sisam suggested that his name is that of Ansila, a legendary Goth ancestor or that he is Osla 'Bigknife' of Arthurian legend, an equivalency still followed by some Arthurian writers, although Osla is <b>elsewhere</b> <b>identified</b> with Octa of Kent.
