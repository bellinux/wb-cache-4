40|$|DNA barcoding methods {{originally}} {{developed for the}} identification of plant specimens have been applied to the authentication of herbal drug materials for industrial quality assurance. These methods are intended to be complementary to current morphological and chemical methods of identification. The adoption of these methods by industry will be accelerated {{by the introduction of}} DNA-based identification techniques into regulatory standards and monographs. The introduction of DNA methods into the British Pharmacopoeia is described, along with a reference standard for use as a positive control for DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A general <b>troubleshooting</b> <b>chart</b> is provided to guide the user through the problems that may be encountered during this process. Nevertheless, the nature of the plant materials and the demands of industrial quality control procedures mean that conventional DNA barcoding is not the method of choice for industrial quality control. The design of DNA barcode-targeted quantitative PCR and high resolution melt curve tests is one strategy for developing rapid, robust, and reliable protocols for high-throughput screening of raw materials. The development of authentication tests for wild-harvested Rhodiola rosea L. is used as a case study to exemplify these relatively simple tests. By way of contrast, the application of next-generation sequencing to create a complete profile of all the biological entities in a mixed herbal drug is described and its potential for industrial quality assurance discussed...|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 129 - 180 With blading {{problems}} {{accounting for}} as many as 42 percent of the failures in gas turbines (Allianz, 1 978) and with its severe effect on plant availability, there is a pressing need for a unified treatment of the causes, failure modes, and troubleshooting to assist plant engineers in tackling blade failure problems. This paper provides a comprehensive practical treatment of the subject, taking into account the complex nature of blading problems, influence of the operating environment, design factors, and maintenance practices. Blade failure modes such as fatigue, environmental attack, creep, erosion, and embrittlement are addressed along with a synopsis of design tools to review blade reliability. Peripheral issues affecting blade integrity such as fuel and blade quality control are addressed. A blade failure <b>troubleshooting</b> <b>chart</b> is furnished to assist users in diagnosing common failure modes. The object {{of this paper is to}} show, in the context of blading problems, the interrelationship between design, operation, maintenance, and the operational envelope. Several case studies are presented dealing with a variety of failure modes. The treatment focuses on practical troubleshooting of blading problems augmented, in some cases, by the use of analytical tools. APPENDIX A provides applicable tools, rules of thumb, and formulae that can be used by gas turbine users for design review and troubleshooting...|$|E
5000|$|Polychotomous key {{refers to}} the number of {{alternatives}} which a decision point may have in a non-temporal hierarchy of independent variables. The number of alternatives are equivalent to the root or nth root of a mathematical or logical variable. Decision points or independent variables with two states have a binary root that is referred to as a dichotomous key whereas, the term polychotomous key refers to roots which are greater than one or unitary and usually greater than two or binary. Polychotomous keys are used in troubleshooting to build <b>troubleshooting</b> <b>charts</b> and in classification/identification schemes with characteristics that have more than one attribute and the order of characteristics is not inherently based on the progression of time.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} how refrigeration, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (RHVAC) service technicians (techs) learned from troubleshooting. This understanding resulted in instructional and curricular strategies designed to help community colleges prepare vocational students to learn more effectively from informal workplace learning. RHVAC techs were studied because they increasingly learn their trade skills through a combination of formal schooling and informal workplace learning, though many still learn their trade almost exclusively in the workplace. Even those with formal training require considerable workplace experience to become fully competent. Troubleshooting is a major job function for RHVAC service techs, and troubleshooting is widely acknowledged as an excellent learning opportunity. The critical incident technique was used to interview 10 recent graduates of a community college RHVAC training program about what and how they learned from troubleshooting. A majority of the techs reported that they received little continuing education or structured on- the-job training, and relied on informal learning to acquire new skills. They learned from others (in person and via cellular phone networks), by reflection during and after troubleshooting, by using manuals, and by writing in log books or completing work orders. They learned cause and effect relationships resembling symptom-cause <b>troubleshooting</b> <b>charts</b> which they held in memory for use in subsequent troubleshooting. They also improved their use of electrical schematics and electrical test equipment. Pride of workmanship was a significant motivator for learning. Suggestions for community colleges included: integrating informal workplace learning strategies into technical training, preparing students to learn using cell phone networks, modeling and promoting pride of workmanship, counseling students to consider potential formal and informal learning opportunities available from employers when seeking employment, teaching root cause analysis as a learning strategy, promoting learning from technical manuals, having students keep daily logbooks as a learning strategy, and emphasizing reading electrical schematics and using electrical test instruments in training for electrical troubleshooting. A troubleshooting process that incorporates informal learning in the workplace was detailed...|$|R

Accurate identification of these charts is necessary to the efficiency and reduction of system <b>troubleshooting</b> time. Control <b>chart</b> patterns can also be considered as time series. Apart from the ability to classify time series, discovering useful hidden patterns in them is advantageous as their behaviours and characteristics can then be understood. Mining and classification of time series have received much attention recently. As hidden patterns in time series are detected from consecutive values rather than from values at particular instances, this renders most data mining algorithms inappropriate. Therefore, suitable symbolic representation of the time series under investigation is beneficial to the mining process. This work introduces a novel approach in mining and classification of times series in industrial application where the case study is control chart patterns. The approach utilizes a symbolic representation of times series known as Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) and a technique in generating association rules known as Self-adjusting Association Rules Generator (SARG). The approach was able to produce classifiers which could classify two benchmark control chart datasets, that were used in previous works, with better performance. Apart from the ability to classify the control chart patterns, it could also discover patterns which underlined the behaviours of these charts. I...|$|R
