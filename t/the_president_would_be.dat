5|$|On January 6, 1917, Rutherford, aged 47, {{was elected}} {{president}} of the Watch Tower Society, unopposed, at the Pittsburgh convention. By-laws passed by both the Pittsburgh convention and the board of directors stated that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the executive officer and general manager of the Society, giving him full charge of its affairs worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Spirit Splash occurs the Friday {{before the}} Homecoming game, {{and serves as}} a pep rally where {{students}} descend into the pond to demonstrate school spirit. Spirit Splash began in 1995 when then-Student Body President Miguel Torregrossa was pushed into the Reflecting Pond by one of his cabinet members and fellow students followed suit. Along with the thousands of students who attend, there are members of the community, local dignitaries, alumni, children and even dogs who come to join in on the festivities. Knightro, the Marching Knights, cheerleaders, student athletes, and dancers all participate in the pep rally, usually followed by a concert. Spirit Splash was made possible in part by weight testing performed on the Reflecting Pond in preparation for President Richard Nixon's visit to the university to speak at its 1973 commencement. It was determined {{that the best way to}} protect <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to hold commencement in the pond itself, after being drained, so that Secret Service agents could be stationed on the roofs of the adjacent buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} also shortened the president's term {{from seven}} years to four years, freed the president to seek re-election after an initial term, and moved impeachment trials from the courts to the Senate. They also created {{the office of the}} vice president, whose only roles were to succeed a president unable to complete a term of office, to preside over the Senate, and to cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate. The committee transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, for example the power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors. One controversial issue throughout much of the Convention had been the length of the president's term, and whether the president was to be term limited. The problem had resulted from the understanding that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> chosen by Congress; the decision to have the president be chosen instead by an electoral college reduced the chance of the president becoming beholden to Congress, so a shorter term with eligibility for re-election became a viable option.|$|E
50|$|A Navy {{aircraft}} carrying <b>the</b> Vice <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> designated Navy Two.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>president's</b> salary <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{cut from}} $400,000 to {{approximately}} $39,000 per year (the median personal {{income of the}} American worker), and congressional pay and perks <b>would</b> <b>be</b> slashed.|$|R
50|$|During Augusto Pinochet's {{military}} regime from 1973 to 1989, the University experienced many profound changes. On 2 October 1973, Decree number 50 of 1973 stated that <b>the</b> University's <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> designated by <b>the</b> {{military regime}}.|$|R
25|$|The Supreme Prosecutors' Office of Korea (SPO), in laying {{charges against}} Choi and two former presidential aides, have alleged that President Park colluded {{with the three}} in certain {{criminal}} activities. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> questioned by prosecutors, {{the first time this}} has occurred with a serving South Korean president.|$|E
25|$|John Wesley was the {{longtime}} {{president of the}} Methodist Conference, but after his death {{it was agreed that}} in future, so much authority would not be placed in the hands of one man. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> elected for one year, to sit in Wesley's chair. Successive Methodist schisms resulted in multiple presidents, before a united conference assembled in 1932.|$|E
25|$|In The Federalist Papers, James Madison {{explained}} {{his views on}} {{the selection of the}} president and the Constitution. In Federalist No. 39, Madison argued the Constitution was designed to be a mixture of state-based and population-based government. Congress would have two houses: the state-based Senate and the population-based House of Representatives. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> elected by a mixture of the two modes.|$|E
50|$|The first Congress {{elected by}} popular means within the National Front {{extended}} {{the term of}} the National Front from 12 to 16 years, and decided in addition that <b>the</b> first <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> liberal and not conservative.|$|R
50|$|The {{current system}} is purely {{based on the}} Westminster style of {{government}} where {{the head of state}} (being <b>the</b> <b>President)</b> is a ceremonial figurehead with very few executive powers. Under the PTR-MMM agreement, <b>the</b> new <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> elected through a single-round election across the country. Additional powers would include the prerogative to preside over the cabinet of ministers (currently led by the Prime Minister), dissolve the National Assembly, recommendations in various institutions including the appointment of ministers. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> able to address the National Assembly as and when required, and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> elected for a 7-year term, as opposed to the five-year term served by the National Assembly.|$|R
50|$|A {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held in}} Tuvalu on 30 April 2008. The referendum sought to abolish the monarchy of Tuvalu and establish {{the country as a}} republic. Had the referendum passed, <b>the</b> new <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> indirectly elected by the Parliament of Tuvalu.|$|R
25|$|Russell died on October 31, 1916, in Pampa, Texas {{during a}} {{cross-country}} preaching trip. On January 6, 1917, {{board member and}} society legal counsel Joseph Franklin Rutherford, aged 47, {{was elected president of}} the Watch Tower Society, unopposed, at the Pittsburgh convention. Under his presidency, the role of the society underwent a major change. By-laws passed by both the Pittsburgh convention and the board of directors stated that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the executive officer and general manager of the society, giving him full charge of its affairs worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The Fourth Republic {{began with}} the {{adoption}} of the Yushin Constitution on November 21, 1972. This new constitution gave Park effective control over the parliament and the possibility of permanent presidency. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> elected through indirect election by an elected body, and the term of presidency was extended to six years with no restrictions on reappointment. The legislature and judiciary were controlled by the government, and educational guidelines were under direct surveillance as well. Textbooks supporting the ideology of the military government were authorized by the government, diminishing the responsibilities of the Ministry of Education.|$|E
25|$|Nullification {{of federal}} legislation: On September 16, 2010, Bill Howell (R-Stafford), Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, wrote an online Wall Street Journal {{editorial}} advocating {{an amendment to}} the United States Constitution to give state legislatures the power to repeal federal legislation. Under the proposal, if two-thirds of the state legislatures agree, any federal law enacted by Congress and <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> nullified or amended. Howell announced that he will introduce legislation in the 2011 General Assembly to advocate such an amendment. The Republicans advocated in favor of the amendment during the 2011 session.|$|E
25|$|The elder Ford {{was active}} with his four sons in the Boy Scouts of America. <b>The</b> future <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first Eagle Scout to become Vice <b>President</b> or <b>President.</b> <b>The</b> <b>President</b> {{was to say}} later that the award {{was one of his}} proudest accomplishments.|$|R
50|$|The first Congress {{elected by}} popular means within the National Front made a {{constitutional}} change {{to extend the}} term of the National Front from 12 to 16 years and decided that <b>the</b> first <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Liberal, not Conservative as had been agreed before.|$|R
25|$|A {{law passed}} in {{violation}} of the Origination Clause <b>would</b> thus <b>be</b> no more immune from judicial scrutiny because it was passed by both Houses and signed by <b>the</b> <b>President</b> than <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a law passed {{in violation of}} the First Amendment.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} , {{the committee}} obtained {{the testimony of}} a former Secret Service agent, Abraham Bolden, who {{had been assigned to}} the Chicago office in 1963. He alleged that shortly before November 2, the FBI sent a teletype message to the Chicago Secret Service office stating that an attempt to assassinate <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> made on November 2 by a four-man team using high-powered rifles, and that at least one member of the team had a Spanish-sounding name. Bolden claimed that while he did not personally participate in surveillance of the subjects, he learned about a surveillance of the four by monitoring Secret Service radio channels in his automobile and by observing one of the subjects being detained in his Chicago office.|$|E
25|$|The {{agreement}} {{came under}} heavy scrutiny amongst mainly Democrats, who charged that NAFTA {{resulted in a}} loss of American jobs. NAFTA also contained no provisions for labor rights; according to the Bush administration, the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable Mexico's government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws. Bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the NAFTA trade talks. Such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to Congress for a vote, thereby avoiding a situation in which <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that Congress wished to change. While initial signing was possible during his term, negotiations made slow, but steady, progress. President Clinton would go on to make the passage of NAFTA a priority for his administration, despite its conservative and Republican roots—with the addition of two side agreements—to achieve its passage in 1993. NAFTA remains controversial for its impact on wages, jobs, and overall economic growth.|$|E
25|$|Britain {{resolved}} {{to solve the}} dispute by creating an independent Cypriot state. In 1959 all involved parties signed the Zurich agreements: Britain, Turkey, Greece, and the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders, Makarios and Dr. Fazil Kucuk respectively. The new constitution drew heavily on the ethnic composition of the island. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a Greek Cypriot and the Vice-President a Turkish Cypriot with an equal veto. The contribution to the public service would be set {{at a ratio of}} 70:30, and the Supreme Court would consist of an equal number of judges from both communities plus an independent judge who was not Greek, Turkish or British. The Zurich accords were supplemented by a number of treaties. The Treaty of Guarantee stated that secession or union with any state was forbidden, and that Greece, Turkey and Britain would be given guarantor status to intervene should this be violated. The Treaty of Alliance allowed for two small Greek and Turkish military contingents to be stationed on the island whilst the Treaty of Establishment gave Britain sovereignty over two bases in Akrotiri and Dhekelia.|$|E
50|$|Two {{months after}} {{succeeding}} Franklin D. Roosevelt, President Harry S. Truman {{proposed that the}} Speaker of the House and <b>the</b> <b>President</b> pro tempore of the Senate be granted priority {{in the line of}} succession over the Cabinet so as to ensure <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> able to appoint his successor to the Presidency.|$|R
50|$|When Khalap became MP on {{the first}} day of the house itself in a speech on {{reference}} to <b>the</b> late <b>President</b> of India Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, Khalap demanded that best remembrance for <b>the</b> late <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> completion of a Bridge at Dhargal on NH 17 whose foundation stone was laid by Neelam Sanjiva Reddy.|$|R
2500|$|A {{proposed}} alternative bill {{favored by}} Democratic Representatives Chris Van Hollen and Gerald E. Connolly would impose restrictions on President Obama significantly tighter than the Senate bill. [...] Under their proposal, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> only <b>be</b> allowed one round of missile strikes, with possible additional strikes {{in the event}} of additional chemical weapons attacks.|$|R
500|$|At around 9:45p.m. EDT, the White House {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> addressing the nation {{later in the}} evening. At 2:24:05a.m. UTC May 2, 2011 the first public leak was made by Navy Reserve intel officer Keith Urbahn and 47 seconds later by actor and professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson on Twitter. Anonymous government officials confirmed details to the media, and by11 p.m. numerous major news sources were reporting that bin Laden was dead; the number of leaks were characterized as [...] "voluminous" [...] by David E. Sanger.|$|E
500|$|Truman {{emulated}} this {{by flying}} to the Pacific to meet MacArthur. Initially, Truman was unenthusiastic about the idea, as he disliked publicity stunts, but in October 1950, {{in the wake}} of the victories at Pusan and Inchon, MacArthur's star was burning bright. By meeting with him, Truman could emphasize his own part in the victories, as Commander-in-Chief. A message was sent to MacArthur suggesting a meeting on Hawaii or Wake Island. MacArthur replied that he [...] "would be delighted to meet the President on the morning of the 15th at Wake Island." [...] When MacArthur discovered that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> bringing the news media with him, MacArthur asked if he could bring correspondents from Tokyo. His request was denied.|$|E
500|$|The South as a whole, however, {{remained}} divided. In January 1853 Senator Thomas Jefferson Rusk of Texas {{introduced a}} bill to create two railroads, one with a northern route and one with a southern route starting below Memphis on the Mississippi River. Under the Rusk legislation, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> authorized to select the specific termini and routes {{as well as the}} contractors who would build the railroads. [...] Some southerners, however, worried that northern and central interests would leap ahead in construction and opposed any direct aid to private developers on constitutional grounds. [...] Other southerners preferred the isthmian proposals. An amendment was added to the Rusk bill to prohibit direct aid, but southerners still split their vote in Congress and the amendment failed.|$|E
50|$|The {{election}} {{had been}} boycotted by supporters of Vice President Federico Velásquez as he {{objected to the}} term length being increased. Following the amendments, <b>the</b> Vice <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> considered as having resigned {{if they did not}} take a new oath of office. This meant Velásquez lost office as he did not take the oath.|$|R
25|$|Following the 2013 general elections, it was {{expected}} that <b>the</b> new <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> chosen by <b>the</b> party that won a plurality and thus headed by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistan Muslim League (N). It {{is the first time in}} the country that a president elect has been chosen in the presence of a sitting president.|$|R
50|$|S.522 {{required}} <b>the</b> <b>President</b> {{to appoint}} an Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, who would {{serve in the}} Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the Executive Office of <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> <b>The</b> Coordinator <b>would</b> <b>be</b> responsible for coordinating inter agency activity on IP enforcement, developing a Strategic Plan detailing objectives and strategies, working {{with the private sector}} and other outside groups, and reporting to <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and Congress. New provisions were added later that year.|$|R
500|$|This kind of impressment, {{combined}} with the heavy use of corporal punishment for even minor offenses, meant that relations between the black crews and white officers was tepid at best. Crewmen aboard Minas Geraes began planning for a revolt in 1910. They chose João Cândido Felisberto, an experienced sailor, as their leader. The mutiny was delayed several times by disagreements among the participants. In a major meeting on 13 November, some of the revolutionaries {{expressed a desire to}} revolt when <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> inaugurated (15 November), but another leader, Francisco Dias Martins, talked them out of the idea, insisting that their demands would be overshadowed by a perceived rebellion against the political system as a whole. The immediate catalyst for their revolt came on 21 November 1910, when an Afro-Brazilian sailor, Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes, was brutally flogged 250 times for insubordination. A Brazilian government observer, former navy captain José Carlos de Carvalho, stated that the sailor's back looked like [...] "a mullet sliced open for salting." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 16, 2006, Senators Mike DeWine (R-OH), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Chuck Hagel (R-NE), and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) {{introduced}} the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 (S.2455), under which <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> given certain additional limited statutory authority to conduct electronic surveillance of suspected terrorists in the United States subject to enhanced Congressional oversight. Also on March 16, 2006, Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) {{introduced the}} National Security Surveillance Act of 2006 (...) , which would amend FISA to grant retroactive amnesty for warrantless surveillance conducted under presidential authority and provide FISA court (FISC) jurisdiction to review, authorize, and oversight [...] "electronic surveillance programs". On May 24, 2006, Senator Specter and Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) introduced the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Improvement and Enhancement Act of 2006 (...) asserting FISA as the exclusive means to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance.|$|E
2500|$|Kaine and Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona {{introduced}} the War Powers Consultation Act of 2014, which {{would replace the}} War Powers Act of 1973, bringing the Congress back into decisions on the deployment of U.S. military forces. The bill would establish a Congressional Consultation Committee, with which <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> required to consult regularly regarding significant foreign policy matters; before ordering the deployment of the Armed Forces into a significant armed conflict; and at least every two months {{for the duration of}} any significant armed conflict. Kaine argued for the bill by citing his [...] "frustration" [...] over the sloppiness of [...] "process and communication over decisions of war", noting that [...] "Presidents tend to overreach and Congress sometimes willingly ducks tough votes and decisions. We all have to do better." ...|$|E
50|$|A new {{application}} of macro risk {{is essentially a}} converse {{of the first two}} meanings; it refers to how macroeconomics and fluctuations in financial variables generate political risk. For example, economic turbulence that leads to higher or lower levels of approval for <b>the</b> <b>president’s</b> policies <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a form of this macro risk.|$|R
50|$|Supporters of {{the model}} say that, {{although}} elected, the change to a republic is argued to have minor but {{positive impact on the}} rest of Australia's parliament and government. <b>The</b> elected <b>President</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a true figurehead for the Australian people. New provisions in the constitution could prevent <b>the</b> <b>President</b> from taking control of the government away from the Prime Minister.|$|R
50|$|If one of {{the female}} {{candidates}} had won, Iceland would have had nearly all its leading governing and religious positions held by women; <b>the</b> female <b>president</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> head of state, Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir <b>would</b> <b>be</b> head of government, Ásta Ragnheiður Jóhannesdóttir <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the Althing speaker, while Agnes M.
