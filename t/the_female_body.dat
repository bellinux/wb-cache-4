5|$|His {{forms are}} usually abstractions {{of the human}} figure, {{typically}} depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works are usually suggestive of <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>body,</b> apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces. Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace, Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of the {{clitoris}} {{is significantly}} impacted by cultural {{perceptions of the}} organ. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison with that of other sexual organs, and that more education about it could help alleviate social stigmas associated with <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>body</b> and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and vulva in general are visually unappealing, that female masturbation is taboo, or that men {{should be expected to}} master and control women's orgasms.|$|E
5|$|Andreacarus voalavo is a {{parasitic}} mite {{found on}} the Malagasy rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus. First described in 2007, it {{is closely related to}} Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus, which are found on other Malagasy rodents. The length of the idiosoma, the main body, is 630 to 670μm in females and 450 to 480μm in males. Unlike A.eliurus, this species lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between two lyrifissures (sensory organs) on the lower part of <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>body.</b> The pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the chelicera, is serrate, which distinguishes it from A.gymnuromys. Females of A.gymnuromys also have a less ornamented sternal shield (covering part of the underparts) and shorter setae (bristles) on the upperparts.|$|E

5|$|Gabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, {{was well}} {{received}} by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty. Dissanayake explains that the audience {{was fascinated by the}} dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama. He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited. He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>body</b> occupies the audience's attention as an object of male fetish, in Sholay, the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy. Dissanayake argues that Sholay {{can be viewed as a}} national allegory: it lacks a comforting logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged, and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India. The narrative style of Sholay, with its violence, revenge, and vigilante action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in the Emergency (rule by decree) declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Eric Morley {{organized}} the Festival Bikini Contest, a beauty contest and swimwear advertising opportunity at that year's Festival of Britain. The press, welcoming the spectacle, {{referred to it}} as Miss World, a name Morley registered as a trademark. The winner was Kiki Håkansson of Sweden, who was crowned in a bikini. After the crowning, Håkansson was condemned by Pope Pius XII, while Spain and Ireland threatened to withdraw from the pageant. In 1952, bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced by evening gowns. As a result of the controversy, the bikini was explicitly banned from many other beauty pageants worldwide. Though some regarded the bikini and beauty contests as bringing freedom to women, they were opposed by some feminists as well as religious and cultural groups who objected to the degree of exposure of <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Bruce Bagemihl's {{survey of}} The Zoological Record (1978–1997)– which {{contains}} {{over a million}} documents from over 6,000 scientific journals– 539 articles focusing on the penis were found, while 7 were found focusing on the clitoris. In 2000, researchers Shirley Ogletree and Harvey Ginsberg concluded {{that there is a}} general neglect of the word clitoris in common vernacular. They looked at the terms used to describe genitalia in the PsycINFO database from 1887 to 2000 and found that penis was used in 1,482 sources, vagina in 409, while clitoris was only mentioned in 83. They additionally analyzed 57 books listed in a computer database for sex instruction. In the majority of the books, penis was the most commonly discussed body part– mentioned more than clitoris, vagina, and uterus put together. They last investigated terminology used by college students, ranging from Euro-American (76%/76%), Hispanic (18%/14%), and African American (4%/7%), regarding the students' beliefs about sexuality and knowledge on the subject. The students were overwhelmingly educated to believe that the vagina is the female counterpart of the penis. The authors found that the students' belief that the inner portion of the vagina is the most sexually sensitive part of <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>body</b> correlated with negative attitudes toward masturbation and strong support for sexual myths.|$|E

50|$|They {{reproduce}} by fertilizing eggs {{outside of}} <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> <b>body</b> (see frog reproduction). Of the seven amplexus modes (positions in which frogs mate), these frogs are found breeding in inguinal amplexus, where the male clasps <b>the</b> <b>female</b> {{in front of}} <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> back legs and squeezes until eggs come out.

50|$|As {{this species}} is known {{from a single}} male specimen, its life cycle is unknown.

25|$|Similarly, {{multiple}} {{varieties of}} nematodes {{have been found}} in the abdominal cavities of the primitively social sweat bee, Lasioglossum zephyrum.

25|$|When {{females have}} a higher {{baseline}} level of testosterone, they have higher increases in sexual arousal levels but smaller increases in testosterone, indicating a ceiling effect on testosterone levels in females.

25|$|Corsets {{were used}} in women’s gowns for {{emphasizing}} the small waist of <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>body.</b> They function as an undergarment which can be adjusted to bound tightly around the waist, hold and train a person’s waistline, so to slim and conform it to a fashionable silhouette. It also helped stop the bodice from horizontal creasing. With the corset, a very small tight fitting waist would be shown.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I utilise 'autoethnography'. In {{dialogue}} with my white ancestor's Dr Sidney Spencer Kachalola Broomfield's autobiography Kachalola or the Mighty Hunter (1931), I examine his representation of <b>the</b> black <b>female</b> <b>body</b> in Northern Rhodesia (present day Zambia). Broomfield presents <b>the</b> black <b>female</b> <b>body</b> as decadent, demonised and sexualised, accusing it of conquering white men regardless of education, class and religious affiliation.

40|$|Egg {{biometrics}} {{data were}} collected in 2003 – 2007 in the core breeding area of the Scaly-sided Merganser Mergus squamatus in South Primorye, Russia. Mean egg length was 62. 5 mm (s. e. ± 0. 1 mm) and mean maximum diameter was 44. 7 mm (± 0. 1). Data on fresh egg weight and density for the Scaly-sided Merganser are published for the first time; fresh egg weight was 70. 7 g (± 0. 9) and density was 0. 56 g/cc (± 0. 002). The mass of a full clutch equates to ~ 76. 7 % of <b>the</b> <b>female’s</b> <b>body</b> mass before egg-laying, and an average Scaly-sided Merganser egg weighs ~ 7. 2 % of <b>the</b> <b>female’s</b> <b>body</b> mass before egg-laying.

25|$|The sperm {{is stored}} in the female's sperm storage tubules for a period varying from a week to more than 100 days, {{depending}} on the species. Then, eggs will be fertilized individually as they leave the ovaries, before the shell is calcified in the oviduct. After the egg is laid by the female, the embryo continues to develop in the egg outside <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
25|$|The vagina is {{a feature}} of animals in which the female is {{internally}} fertilized, other than by traumatic insemination. The shape of the vagina varies among different animals. In placental mammals and marsupials, the vagina leads from the uterus to the exterior of <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>body.</b> Female marsupials have two lateral vaginas, which lead to separate uteri, but both open externally through the same orifice.|$|E
25|$|Despite Hildegard's self-professed {{view that}} her {{compositions}} have as object the praise of God, one scholar has asserted that Hildegard made a {{close association between}} music and <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>body</b> in her musical compositions. According to him, the poetry and music of Hildegard's Symphonia would therefore be concerned with the anatomy of female desire thus described as Sapphonic, or pertaining to Sappho, connecting her to a history of female rhetoricians.|$|E

25|$|The issues {{concerning}} sexual objectification became first problemized during the 1970s by feminist groups. Since then, {{it has been}} argued that the phenomenon of female sexual objectification has increased drastically since its problematization in all levels of life, and has resulted in negative consequences for women, especially in the political sphere. However, a rising form of new third-waver feminist groups have also taken the increased objectification of women as an opportunity to use <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>body</b> as a mode of power.|$|E
25|$|Each {{culture of}} human society has {{developed}} social norms {{relating to the}} presence or absence of body hair, which has changed from one time to another. Different standards can apply to females and males. People whose hair falls outside a culture's aesthetic standards may experience real or perceived social acceptance problems. For example, for women in several societies, exposure in public of body hair other than head hair, eyelashes and eyebrows is generally considered to be unaesthetic, unattractive and embarrassing. In Middle Eastern societies, removal of <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>body</b> hair has been considered proper hygiene, necessitated by local customs, for many centuries.|$|E
25|$|In her works, Abramović affirms her {{identity}} through {{the perspective of}} others, however, more importantly by changing the roles of each player, the identity and nature of humanity at large is unraveled and showcased. By doing so, the individual experience morphs into a collective one and creates a powerful message. Abramović's art also represents the objectification of <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>body,</b> as she remains motionless and allows the spectators to do as they please with her body, pushing the limits of what one would consider acceptable. This type of representation also reflects key political issues such as BDSM, which complicates and questions the relation between art versus sexuality and public discourse.|$|E
50|$|Squamates are {{represented}} by viviparous, ovoviviparous, and oviparous species. Viviparous means that <b>the</b> <b>female</b> gives birth to live young, Ovoviviparous means that the egg will develop inside <b>the</b> <b>female’s</b> <b>body</b> and Oviparous means that <b>the</b> <b>female</b> lays eggs. A few species within Squamata {{have the ability to}} reproduce asexually. The tuatara lays eggs that are usually about one inch in length and which take about 14 months to incubate.|$|R
40|$|Slender {{and skinny}} body ideals have been {{associated}} with psychological disorders such as eating disorders. However, the tendency to promote a healthier" and more athletic <b>female</b> <b>body</b> ideal has received minimal critical attention. This study aims at exploring the underlying conditions for such an athletic ideal through asking: How is <b>the</b> <b>female</b> athletic <b>body</b> constructed in the contemporary women's fitness magazine, Det Nye ShapeUp"? We investigated our object of inquiry through a modified version of Parker's (1992) approach to Foucauldian discourse analysis and analysed the interviews of four athletic role models in Det Nye ShapeUp". We identified four discourses: 1. Neo-liberal discourse", 2. Health discourse", 3. Discourse of surveillance and control" and 4. Discourse of emancipation". The 1. Neo-liberal discourse" constructs <b>the</b> <b>female</b> athletic <b>body</b> as something that the individual woman should strive for by appropriately managing her own resources, abilities and skills. The 2. Health discourse" constructs <b>the</b> <b>female</b> athletic <b>body</b> through a homeostatic logic where the individual is responsible and healthcare experts have the mandate to intervene in order to maintain good health. The 3. Discourse of surveillance and control" constructs <b>the</b> <b>female</b> athletic <b>body</b> as an internalized panoptic stance, disciplining women to accept hegemonic beauty ideals. The 4. Discourse of emancipation" accentuates that <b>the</b> <b>female</b> athletic <b>body</b> is alleviated from a culturally rigid body image and instead improved physical performance and functionality are considered good ends. The results and discussion indicate that <b>the</b> <b>female</b> athletic <b>body</b> is a result of a complex nexus of different discourses associated to the powers of economy, sex differences, institutions and ideological forces. We have advocated that magazines like Det Nye ShapeUp" can have covert disciplinary effects hidden by seemingly well-intentioned motives, which can contribute to women's objectification of their bodies. ...|$|R
