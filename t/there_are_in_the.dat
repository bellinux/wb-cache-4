5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum {{has proven to be}} by far the most hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria. It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young. Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. It is thought that there are more plants in cultivation than <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild.|$|E

25|$|The cosmic {{experiment}} {{envisioned by}} Wheeler {{could be described}} either as analogous to the interferometer experiment or as analogous to a double-slit experiment. The {{important thing is that}} by a third kind of device, a massive stellar object acting as a gravitational lens, photons from a source can arrive by two pathways. Depending on how phase differences between wavefunction pairs are arranged, correspondingly different kinds of interference phenomena can be observed. Whether to merge the incoming wavefunctions or not, and how to merge the incoming wavefunctions can be controlled by experimenters. There are none of the phase differences introduced into the wavefunctions by the experimental apparatus as <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laboratory interferometer experiments, so despite there being no double-slit device near the light source, the cosmic experiment is closer to the double-slit experiment. However, Wheeler planned for the experiment to merge the incoming wavefunctions by use of a beam splitter.|$|E

25|$|The Samaritans {{interpret}} the deuteronomic commandment to mean displaying any select text from the Samaritan {{version of the}} five Books of Moses. This can contain a blessing or a particularly holy or uplifting message. In the past they placed a stone plaque inscribed with the Ten Commandments above the house door, some examples {{dating back to the}} Byzantine (4th-7th century) and Early Muslim (7th-11th century) periods being now shown in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. Nowadays a Samaritan mezuzah is usually made of either marble, a wooden plate, or a sheet of parchment or high quality paper, on which they inscribe select verses from the Samaritan Torah. This they place either above the house door, or inside the house, in the entrance hall or at a prominent place on a large wall. These mezuzot are found in every Samaritan household {{as well as in the}} synagogue. Today some Samaritans would also use a Jewish-style mezuzah case and place inside it a small written Samaritan scroll, i.e. a text from the Samaritan Torah, written in the Samaritan alphabet. The more such mezuzot <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house, the better it is considered to be.|$|E
25|$|Oftentimes, schools simply {{lack the}} {{resources}} to create an optimal classroom setting for those in need of special education. In the United States, it can cost between $6595 to $10,421 extra to educate a child with autism. In the 2011-2012 school year, {{the average cost of}} education for a public school student was $12,401. In some cases, the extra cost required to educate a child with autism nearly doubles the average cost to educate the average public school student. As the range of those with autism can widely vary, {{it is very difficult to}} create an autism program that is well suited to the entire population of autistics as well as those with other disabilities. In the United States, many school districts are requiring schools to meet the needs of disabled students, regardless of the number of children with disabilities <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school. This combined with a shortage of licensed special education teachers has created a deficiency in the special education system. The shortage has caused some states to give temporary special education licenses to teachers with the caveat that they receive a license within a few years.|$|E

500|$|The branch-line coupler {{consists}} of two parallel transmission lines physically coupled together with two or more branch lines between them. [...] The branch lines are spaced λ/4 apart and represent sections of a multi-section filter design {{in the same way}} as the multiple sections of a coupled line coupler except that here the coupling of each section is controlled with the impedance of the branch lines. [...] The main and coupled line are [...] of the system impedance. [...] The more sections <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coupler, the higher is the ratio of impedances of the branch lines. [...] High impedance lines have narrow tracks and this usually limits the design to three sections in planar formats due to manufacturing limitations. [...] A similar limitation applies for coupling factors looser than low coupling also requires narrow tracks. [...] Coupled lines are a better choice when loose coupling is required, but branch-line couplers are good for tight coupling and can be used for [...] hybrids. [...] Branch-line couplers usually do not have such a wide bandwidth as coupled lines.
