Despite initially <b>trailing</b> <b>behind</b> his {{opponent in the}} Democratic primary by 30 percentage points, Corzine won the nomination and was subsequently elected to the Senate by a four-percent margin over his Republican opponent, four-term United States Congressman Bob Franks, in the November 2000 election and was sworn into the Senate in January 2001.|$|E
5|$|After Re d'Italia sank, the Italian fleet {{began to}} disengage, with the badly burning Palestro <b>trailing</b> <b>behind,</b> {{soon to be}} {{destroyed}} by a magazine explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, he refused to counter-attack with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance {{so as not to}} risk his success. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively.|$|E

The last man standing was Steven Bradbury from Australia, who was <b>trailing</b> <b>behind</b> at the time, and skated through to win the gold medal, becoming the first person from the southern hemisphere to win a gold medal at a Winter Olympics. Ohno quickly got to his feet and crossed the finish line to win silver with Turcotte winning the bronze. Ohno, coincidentally was wearing skates, made by Bradbury's own boot company, Revolutionary Boot Company. Bradbury had given them to Ohno, expecting for Ohno to win wearing them.|$|E
5|$|The heavy dagger-like bill is evenly tapered and greyish, {{sometimes}} {{having a}} black tip. The bill colour and angle distinguish this species from the yellow-billed loon. The neck {{is short and}} thick. It swims very low in the water, with sometimes only its head held above and horizontal to water. It must run across the water surface to get in flight. During flight, its head is slightly lower than its body, with its feet <b>trailing</b> <b>behind.</b> It has a skeletal structure {{made up of a}} number of solid bones (this is usual for the Gaviiformes and penguins but unlike most flying birds which have bones with extensive pneumatization, hollow and filled with air to make the lighter), which adds weight but helps in diving.|$|E

5|$|Under Moses Annenberg, The Inquirer turned around. Annenberg added new features, {{increased}} {{staff and}} held promotions to increase circulation. By November 1938 Inquirers weekday circulation increased to 345,422 from 280,093 in 1936. During {{that same period}} the Records circulation had dropped to 204,000 from 328,322. In 1939, Annenberg was charged with income tax evasion. Annenberg pleaded guilty before his trial and was sent to prison where he died in 1942. Upon Moses Annenberg's death, his son, Walter Annenberg, took over. Not long after, in 1947, the Record {{went out of business}} and The Philadelphia Inquirer became Philadelphia's only major daily morning newspaper. While still <b>trailing</b> <b>behind</b> Philadelphia's largest newspaper, the Evening Bulletin, The Inquirer continued to be profitable. In 1948, Walter Annenberg expanded the Inquirer Building with a new structure that housed new printing presses for The Inquirer and, during the 1950s and 1960s, Annenberg's other properties, Seventeen and TV Guide. In 1957 Annenberg bought the Philadelphia Daily News and combined the Daily News facilities with The Inquirers.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 1806, Warren's {{squadron}} was cruising in the Eastern Atlantic. Most of {{the squadron}} were grouped to the northwest, but HMS London under Captain Sir Harry Burrard-Neale and the flagship HMS Foudroyant under Captain John Chambers White were sailing together {{some distance from}} the rest of the British force, in company with the frigate HMS Amazon under Captain William Parker. At 03:00, sails were spotted to the north-east by lookouts on London. Hastening in pursuit with the wind from the south-west, Captain Neale signalled the location of the strange ships to Warren with blue lights, the admiral following with Amazon and the rest of the squadron <b>trailing</b> <b>behind.</b> To the north-east, Linois had also sighted sails in the distance and turned Marengo south-west in pursuit, anticipating a third encounter with a valuable merchant convoy. Captain Alain-Adélaïde-Marie Bruilhac of Belle Poule insisted that the sails were from British warships, but Linois over-ruled him, arguing that any warships would be part of the convoy's escort and could be avoided in the night. It was not until 05:30, when London appeared from the gloom just ahead of Marengo that Linois realised his mistake. He attempted to escape, but his ships had been at sea for an extended period and were sluggish compared to the 98-gun London, which rapidly came alongside the French ship of the line and opened a heavy fire.|$|E
5|$|Prism {{made its}} {{official}} debut in Ireland, where it charted atop the charts. In the United States, the album {{opened at the}} top spot on the US Billboard 200, becoming her second consecutive number one album in the country. The album sold 286,000 copies in its first week. Prism acquired the largest first week sum by a female artist for 2013, surpassing Miley Cyrus' Bangerz (270,000 copies). However, this feat was surpassed by Beyoncé's self-titled fifth album, Beyoncé (617,213 digital copies), released in December 2013. At {{the time of its}} release Prism had the fourth highest first week sales of the year for a pop record, <b>trailing</b> <b>behind</b> Daft Punk's May 2013 album Random Access Memories, which sold 339,000 copies and Justin Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience which debuted to 968,000 copies and its follow-up The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2 which debuted to just 350,000 copies. The first week sales also marks Perry's highest weekly sales, with her previous album Teenage Dream selling 192,000 copies in its first week in August 2010. Prism has the highest first week sales for a female pop artist since Madonna's twelfth studio album, MDNA. Prism sold 92,000 copies during its second week of availability, falling to number two on the Billboard 200. This represented the smallest sales dip for a number one album in the United States since the August 2013 release of The Civil Wars. Prism has spent 17 weeks so far in the top-ten on the chart. The album has been certified double Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold 1.7 million copies in the United States as of February 2017. In June 2014, Billboard announced its Mid Year Top 20 Best-selling albums with Prism coming in at number 9 with sales of 453,000 in 2014 alone. Pharrell Williams and Perry were the only two people in to have an album and a single in the Mid Year Top 10 charts. In February 2015, following Perry's performance at the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show, sales for the album increased by 85% and the album rebounded back into the Top 50.|$|E

25|$|The Prussian {{army was}} so {{thoroughly}} shattered by its defeat {{that it had}} not recovered cohesion by the next day. Shot through both eyes, Brunswick expired at Altona on 10 November. The badly wounded Rüchel made his way to Poland where he recovered. The retreating mass of Prussians resolved itself into three columns under Prince Hohenlohe, Lieutenant General Gebhard von Blücher, and General of the Infantry Friedrich Adolf, Count von Kalckreuth. These forces marched through the Harz Mountains toward Halberstadt. <b>Trailing</b> <b>behind</b> was the 12,000-man corps of Lieutenant General Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, which missed Jena-Auerstadt.|$|E

25|$|However, as speeds rise, the {{resultant}} exhaust speed goes down, {{and the overall}} vehicle energetic efficiency rises, reaching a peak of around 100% of the engine efficiency when the vehicle is travelling exactly {{at the same speed}} that the exhaust is emitted. In this case the exhaust would ideally stop dead in space behind the moving vehicle, taking away zero energy, and from conservation of energy, all the energy would end up in the vehicle. The efficiency then drops off again at even higher speeds as the exhaust ends up travelling forwards- <b>trailing</b> <b>behind</b> the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Peterson {{worked to}} pay off the party's debt from the 1981 {{election}} and accomplished {{that by the end of}} the year and was working on long-term debt. Peterson performed well as opposition leader and was popular in the press. The party started to use him as a label rather than 'Liberal' referring to 'David Peterson's Ontario'. A by-election loss to the NDP was attributed to dislike of Federal Liberals. In 1984, a Liberal backbencher, J. Earl McEwen crossed the floor to join the Tories. Polling in late 1984 showed Peterson's Liberals consistently <b>trailing</b> <b>behind</b> the Progressive Conservatives. Premier Davis still polled as the most popular leader.|$|E

The Communist Party of Ukraine was eliminated from {{representation in the}} election because it failed to overcome the 5% election threshold with its 3.87% of the votes. Because of the War in Donbass and the unilateral annexation of Crimea by Russia elections were not held in Crimea and also not in large parts of Donbass, both were before stronghold of the Party of Regions and the Communist Party of Ukraine.|$|E

25|$|Following November 1919 elections, Iorga {{became a}} member of the Senate, {{representing}} the Democratic Nationalists. Although he resented the universal male suffrage and viewed the adoption of electoral symbols as promoting political illiteracy, his PND came to use a logo representing two hands grasping (later replaced with a black-flag-and-sickle). The elections seemed to do away with the old political system: Iorga's party was third, <b>trailing</b> <b>behind</b> two newcomers, the Transylvanian PNR and the Poporanist Peasants' Party (PȚ), with whom it formed a parliamentary bloc supporting an Alexandru Vaida-Voevod cabinet. This union of former rivals also showed Iorga's growing suspicion of Brătianu, whom he feared intended to absorb the PND into the National Liberal Party, and accused of creating a political machine. He and his disciples were circulating the term politicianism ("politicking"), expressing their disappointment for the new political context.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the federal victory at Corinth, the railroads that linked Memphis with {{the eastern part of the}} Confederacy had been cut, {{severely}} reducing the strategic importance of the city. Therefore, in early June 1862, Memphis and its nearby forts were abandoned by the rebel army. Most of the garrison were sent to join units elsewhere, including Vicksburg and only a small rear guard was left to make a token resistance. The River Defense Fleet was also to have retreated to Vicksburg, but it could not get enough coal in Memphis. Unable to flee when the federal fleet appeared on June 6, Montgomery and his captains had to decide whether to fight, or scuttle their boats.

25|$|Meanwhile, {{throughout}} {{the early and}} mid 1950s, the Royal Air Force (RAF) had developed an intense desire to advance {{the performance of their}} aircraft; in particular, the service sought new fighter aircraft that would be capable of routinely flying at very high speeds and high altitudes as a long term replacement for its existing inventory of roughly 700 first-generation jet fighters. At the time, there was a perception that Britain was <b>trailing</b> <b>behind</b> in supersonic aircraft design, and there was pressure to correct this. Events such as the Korean War and rapid advances in the fields of supersonic aerodynamics, structures and aero engines by the British aircraft industry had the effect of increasing demand and the potential capabilities of new fighters. In addition to developing improved versions of existing and emerging fighters such as the Hawker Hunter and Gloster Javelin, there was an appetite for even more promising entirely new aircraft.|$|E
