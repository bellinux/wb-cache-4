40|$|Abstract Twenty Apulian and Sicilian cheeses were {{analysed}} for their concentrations of eight biogenic amines (BAs), free amino acids, pH, water activity, {{and subjected to}} microbiological characterisation. In addition, lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses were assayed for their capacity to generate BAs. Principal component analysis was performed to find the effect of different parameters {{on the distribution of}} the cheeses. Although short-ripened (≤ 30 d) cheeses did not show significant BA concentrations, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>BA</b> showing high positive correlation with time of ripening was histamine. Concentration of histidine and, especially, percentage of histidine-decarboxylase bacteria presumably affected histamine concentration. High pH values were negatively correlated to the concentration of tyramine, putrescine, and cadaverine. Fifty percent of the cheeses contained at least one BA at potentially toxic concentrations.

40|$|Biogenic amines (BA) {{are present}} {{in a wide range}} of foods and mainly can be {{produced}} in high amounts by microorganisms through the activity of amino acid decarboxylases. Excessive consumption of foods with large concentrations of these compounds can induce adverse reactions such as nausea, headaches, rashes and changes in blood pressure. These problems are more severe in consumers with less efficient detoxification systems because of their genetic constitution or their medical treatments. The most common and powerful BA found in foods are histamine, tyramine and putrescine. Actually, there is no specific legislation regarding BA content in many fermented products, except for histamine; it is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>BA</b> for which maximum levels in fish products have been set. So, it is generally assumed that these compounds should not be allowed to accumulate. Many factors such as bacterial density, synergistic effects between microorganisms, level of proteolysis (availability of substrate), pH, salt, use of starter cultures, sanitization procedures adopted and conditions and time of ripening process are found to have limiting effects on the build-up of amines. Moreover, improved knowledge of the factors involved in the synthesis and accumulation of BA should lead to reduce in their incidence in foods...|$|E

40|$|Biogenic amines (BAs) {{are defined}} as low {{molecular}} weight organic bases with biological activity. They are formed and degraded {{as part of the}} normal metabolism of microorganisms, plants and animals, in which they have important physiological functions. In humans, BAs are involved in brain activity, the regulation of body temperature and stomach pH, gastric acid secretion, the immune response, and cell growth and differentiation etc. However, the consumption of foods with high concentrations of BAs can induce adverse reactions such as nausea, headaches, rashes and changes in blood pressure. The accumulation of BAs in the food matrix is mainly due to the presence of bacteria able to decarboxylate certain amino acids. The most common and powerful BAs found in food are histamine, tyramine and putrescine. Their contents vary, sometimes reaching over 2 g per kg. Histamine is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>BA</b> for which maximum levels in food have been set, although general interest exists in reducing the presence of all BAs in all food products.

40|$|Despite {{the known}} {{validity}} of clinical diagnostic criteria, significant overlap of clinical symptoms between Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) subtypes exists in several cases, resulting in great {{uncertainty of the}} diagnostic boundaries. We evaluated the perfusion between FTD subtypes using brain perfusion Tc- 99 m-HMPAO SPECT with Brodmann areas (BA) mapping. NeuroGam (TM) software was applied on single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) studies for the semi-quantitative evaluation of perfusion in BA and the comparison with the software's normal database. We studied 91 consecutive FTD patients: 21 with behavioural variants (bvFTD), 39 with language variants (lvFTD) [12 with progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), 27 with semantic dementia (SD) ], and 31 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) /corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Stepwise logistic regression analyses showed that the BA 28 L and 32 R could independently differentiate bvFTD from lvFTD, while the BA 8 R and 25 R could discriminate bvFTD from SD and PNFA, respectively. Additionally, BA 7 R and 32 R were found to discriminate bvFTD from CBD/PSP. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>BA</b> that could differentiate SD from PNFA was 6 L.

40|$|Geophysical and geochemical {{investigations}} were undertaken {{over the}} Long Rake at Haddon Fields, Derbyshire {{in order to}} establish methods, or combinations of methods, showing the best response to the mineralisation. The mineralised structure carries high concentrations of fluorite with associated lead and zinc minerals and the gangue minerals baryte and calcite. The ground examined was relatively undisturbed with good geological control from drill hole data. Gravity and magnetic anomalies such as those obtained over the Long Rake could have limited applications for the indirect location of veins the approximate position of which is known. Induced polarisation, resistivity and electro-magnetic measurements failed to produce anomalies which could be directly attributed to the mineralisation or its host structure. However, reconnaissance mapping with very low frequency electro-magnetic (VLF-EM) and Radiohm methods showed that, over a large section of the survey area, the fluorspar vein could be mapped by its association with the subdrift shale/limestone contact. The determination {{of a wide range of}} elements in soils and tills showed that the more mobile elements such as F and Zn are particularly useful in detecting mineralisation over broad areas. Less mobile elements tend to exhibit localised disperson patterns which have applications in precisely locating an orebody. Elements enriched in soil above the Long Rake, in areas of thin overburden, include Pb, Ba, Sr, Ca, Zn, Rb and Th.

Ba 1 was purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation and {{was found to have}} an icosahedral head that contained a linear genome of approximately 46. 5 kb (contour length) of double-stranded DNA and a contractile, sheathed tail.

DNA hybridization studies indicated the prophage was integrated at a preferred site on both the host and phage replicons. Ba 1 transduced five distinctly different insertion mutations, suggesting that transduction was generalized. Transduction frequencies ranged from approximately 2 × 10 − 7 to 1 × 10 − 8 transductants/PFU depending upon the marker being transduced.

40|$|Side-scan {{sonar imaging}} of the Central Lau Basin (SW Pacific) has {{revealed}} a Central Lau Spreading Centre (CLSC) propagating southwards {{at the expense}} of an Eastern Lau Spreading Centre (ELSC) with a small Intermediate Lau Spreading Centre (ILSC) forming a ‘relay’ between the two. Volcanic rocks sampled along these spreading centres, and from two adjacent seamounts, are glassy to fine-grained pillow lavas and sheet flows of basalts, ferrobasalts and andesites. The evolved rocks are mostly confined to the propagating tip of the CLSC and can be explained by a high rate of cooling relative to magma supply, as invoked for magma genesis at propagating ridges elsewhere. Compared with equivalent rocks from the eastern Pacific, the most evolved members of the CLSC suite require similarly high degrees (> 90 %) of fractional crystallization from their basaltic parents. Fractional crystallisation cannot, however, account for the compositional differences between CLSC and ELSC lavas. Whereas the composition of the CLSC lavas lies just within the compositional spectrum of typical N-MORB, the ELSC lavas are distinctly enriched in alkali and alkaline earth elements, reach oxide and apatite saturation at lower Fe, Ti and P concentrations and generally show greater vesicularity despite slightly greater depths of eruption, all indicative of a water-rich subduction component. They also have lower contents of Ni, Sc, Na and Fe and higher contents of Si at a given MgO concentration that indicate a more depleted and more hydrous mantle beneath the ELSC compared with the CLSC. These results provide further evidence that, beneath the Central Lau Basin, the source composition changes progressively from MORB-type to island arc tholeiite type as the subduction zone is approached, both eastwards from the CLSC to ELSC and southwards along the ELSC to the Valu Fa Ridge. They also indicate that the composition of the subduction component may vary systematically away from the arc, with Th, LREE, Ba, Rb and H (as H 2 O) all present close to <b>the</b> arc, <b>only</b> <b>Ba,</b> Rb and H 2 O present at intermediate distances and just H 2 O perceptible at the furthest distances...|$|R

Bile acids (BAs) are present in reflux and cause various pathologies in the esophagus, the larynx, and the lungs. ObjectiveWe aimed to show if aminoguanidine (AG) contributes to the biochemical and histopathologic treatment of experimental aspiration pneumonitis induced by BAs. MethodsTwenty-eight female Sprague Dawley rats were used. There were 4 groups in the study: (1) group aspirated with 0. 9 % saline (n = 7), (2) group aspirated with 0. 9 % saline and treated with AG (n = 7), (3) group aspirated with a solution of 10 mg/kg taurocholic acid and 5 mg/kg taurochenodeoxycholate (n = 7), and (4) group aspirated with BA and treated with AG (n = 7). The saline and BA solutions were administered as 1 mL/kg intratracheally. The AG was administered intraperitoneally twice a day at a 150 mg/kg dose for 7 days. The different histopathologic and biochemical parameters were analyzed. ResultsClara cell protein 16 and malondialdehyde levels {{were found to be}} significantly higher in the BA group than in the group where saline was administered; however, they were significantly lower in the BA + AG group than in the BA group. The total superoxide dismutase activity decreased significantly in the BA group compared with the group where saline was administered. A significant increase in superoxide dismutase activity was observed in the BA + AG group when compared with <b>the</b> group where <b>only</b> <b>BA</b> was administered. When the group where BA was administered solely was compared with the group where saline was administered, peribronchial inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar septal infiltration, alveolar histiocytes, interstitial fibrosis, and granuloma were significantly higher in the BA group than in the saline group. When the BA + AG group was compared with the BA group, peribronchial inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar septal infiltration, alveolar histiocytes, interstitial fibrosis, and granuloma were found to be significantly lower. ConclusionsOxidant stress increases and antioxidant capacity decreases in pneumonitis induced by BAs. AG administration as an antioxidant helps in recovery, both biochemically and histopathologically. Consequently, AG seems to be an alternative that should be considered in a conservative approach to treating aspiration pneumonitis...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we had {{proposed}} to dignify the Cymbidium hybridum protocorms reactions, in a vitroculture regime/condition, on liquid medium MS (1962), maintained on special filter paper bridges (Blidar type [1]), in {{the conditions of}} the presence fructose as principal sources of carbon, using various phytohormons. The basic medium culture used by us in these experiments was Murashige – Skoog (1962), without agar. To this, we added different growth regulators, such as: 2, 4 -D (2 mg/l), or mixture of BA (2 mg/l) with NAA (1 mg/l), or <b>only</b> <b>BA</b> (2 mg/l), or only NAA (1 mg/l). The witness lot was consisted of vitrocultivated protocorms on same liquid medium culture, without growth regulators. At the end of the experimental period, was proved that the stronger multiplication of the protocorms number was registered using medium culture with BA cytochine in a quantity of 2 mg/l, being numerical above 1. 7 times more in comparison with the control variant...|$|R
40|$|Sixty-two {{patients}} with allergic vasculitis and histological evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis were examined {{to determine whether}} clinical features, such as course and degree of systemic involvement, {{could be related to}} the class of the immunoglobulins in immune complexes (IC) in both the circulation and the vessel wall. Circulating IC were detected with the 125 I-C 1 q-binding assay (C 1 q-BA), an anti-IgA inhibition binding assay (a-IgA-Inh BA) and the conglutinin-binding assay (Con-BA). Stabilized heat-aggregated IgG, IgA and IgM were used to determine the immunoglobulin class specificity of these assays. With the C 1 q-BA only aggregated IgG were detected, with <b>the</b> a-IgA-Inh <b>Ba</b> <b>only</b> aggregates containing IgA. With the Con-BA IgG, IgA or IgM in reactive aggregates were identified with class-specific antibodies. For {{patients with}} acute cutaneous vasculitis all assays were negative. The a-IgA-Inh BA was frequently positive in sera of patients with chronic cutaneous and acute systemic vasculitis; in the latter group conglutinin-binding IC of the IgG, IgA and IgM class were also detected. Levels in the C 1 q-BA were high for patients with chronic systemic vasculitis. Comparison {{of the results of the}} IC assays with the immunofluorescence studies of the cutaneous vessel walls of the same patients showed agreement between the results of the C 1 q-BA and deposition of IgG and the results of the a-IgA-Inh BA and IgA deposition. The class of immunoglobulin in conglutinin-binding IC did not correspond as well with the immunoglobulins in vessel walls. This study shows that certain clinical features of allergic vasculitis are related to the composition of the IC in the circulation and in the vessel wall...|$|R
