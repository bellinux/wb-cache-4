All the nominations have to be delivered to <b>the</b> <b>Astronomical</b> Society of the Pacific by December 15 of the nominating year and remain valid for three years.

5|$|In 1963, Gascoigne {{developed}} a device, {{known as an}} optical corrector plate, which allowed wide field photography on the new 40-inch telescope at Siding Spring.

In 1527–30, the clockwork was completely rebuilt by Kaspar Brunner, and the gateway was overarched to provide a secure foundation for the heavy machinery.|$|E
5|$|Mathematics were {{essential}} in drafting <b>the</b> <b>astronomical</b> calendar, a lunisolar calendar that used the Sun and Moon as time-markers throughout the year. Use {{of the ancient}} Sifen calendar (古四分曆), which measured the tropical year at 3651⁄4 days, was replaced in 104 BC with the Taichu calendar (太初曆) that measured the tropical year at 365385⁄1539 days and the lunar month at 2943⁄81 days. However, Emperor Zhang later reinstated the Sifen calendar.|$|E
