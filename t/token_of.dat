5|$|As a <b>token</b> <b>of</b> {{respect for}} Roman religion, however, Elagabalus joined either Astarte, Minerva, Urania, or some {{combination}} of the three to Elagabal as consort. A union between Elagabal and a traditional goddess would have served to strengthen ties between the new religion and the imperial cult. In fact, there may have been an effort to introduce Elagabal, Urania, and Athena as the new Capitoline triad of Rome—replacing Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.|$|E

5|$|After {{settling}} at Glen Noe, {{the chiefs}} {{are said to}} have held the land for centuries. While presumably owning the property outright originally, it is generally agreed that at some, uncertain date, they acquired a feudal obligation to the Campbells of Breadalbane.

Tradition identifies this as a snowball supplied at midsummer and a white calf surrendered but then killed and shared by landlord and tenant as a <b>token</b> <b>of</b> mutual esteem.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the supreme}} {{director}} Juan Martín de Pueyrredón appointed {{a commission to}} discuss the case of Saavedra.

The commission restored Saavedra with the military rank of brigadier, and ordered the payment of all the wages he did not receive during the time he was demoted. A second commission ratified the ruling. The payment was not enough to compensate Saavedra's losses, but he considered it a <b>token</b> <b>of</b> his restored prestige. He was appointed then to help with the protection of the frontier with the natives at Luján.|$|E

The control by the King's Clerk over trade at the market was ended and tolls and rents from the market from then on went directly to the city's bailiffs (the rulers of the city).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{about the}} development of a two stage hybrid Named Entity Recognition (NER) system for Indian Languages particularly for Hindi, Oriya, Bengali and Telugu. We have used both statistical Maximum Entropy Model (MaxEnt) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in this system. We have used variety of features and contextual information for predicting the various Named Entity (NE) classes. The system uses both language dependent and language independent rules. We have also tried to identify the nested named Entities (NES) by giving some linguistic rules and the rules are purely language independent. We have also used gazetteer list in addition to the rules for Oriya, Bengali and Hindi for better accuracy. The system has been trained with Hindi (450, 150 tokens), Oriya (150, 100 tokens), Bengali (93, 023 tokens), and Telugu (50, 250 tokens). The system has been tested with 35, 018 <b>tokens</b> <b>of</b> Hindi 45, 100 <b>tokens</b> <b>of</b> Oriya, 28, 123 <b>tokens</b> <b>of</b> Bengali and 4, 320 <b>tokens</b> <b>of</b> Telugu. 1...|$|R

As a <b>token</b> <b>of</b> his appreciation, Edward gave Aqil a revolver.|$|E
5|$|In some European Celtic or Germanic {{countries}} {{prior to}} the adoption of Christianity, the ruler upon his election was raised on a shield and, while standing upon it, was borne on the shoulders of several chief men of the nation (or tribe) in a procession around his assembled subjects. This was usually performed three times. Following this, the king was given a spear, and a diadem wrought of silk or linen (not to be confused with a crown) was bound around his forehead as a <b>token</b> <b>of</b> regal authority.|$|E

5|$|The aborigines signalled their {{surrender}} {{by sending}} {{a few of their}} best weapons to the Dutch, and then by bringing a small tree (often betel nut) planted in earth from their village as a <b>token</b> <b>of</b> the granting of sovereignty to the VOC. Over the next few months as word of the Dutch victory spread, more and more villages came to pay their respects at Fort Zeelandia and assure the VOC of their friendly intentions. However, the new masters of Mattau also inherited their enemies, with both Favorlang and Tirosen expressing hostility towards the VOC in the wake of their victory.|$|E
5|$|The second {{individual}} to be conferred the rank was Kodandera M. Cariappa, the first Indian {{to serve as}} the commander–in–chief of the Indian Army. Unlike Manekshaw, who was conferred the rank just before his retirement, Cariappa was already retired in 1953, and since a field marshal never retires, therefore retired officers cannot be given the rank. But as a <b>token</b> <b>of</b> gratitude for the exemplary service rendered by him to the nation, the Government of India overruled the pre-established criteria, and conferred the rank of field marshal on him on 28 April 1986 at a special investiture ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan.|$|E
