5|$|Although not {{recognized}} as such {{at the time}} of its discovery, Compsognathus is the first theropod dinosaur known from a reasonably complete fossil skeleton.

5|$|Antlions {{are poorly}} {{represented}} in the fossil record.

5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is lower than {{approximately}} half a solar mass, it will never become hot enough to fuse helium in its core. It is thought that, over a lifespan that considerably exceeds {{the age of the}} Universe (c. 13.8 billion years), such a star will eventually burn all its hydrogen and end its evolution as a helium white dwarf composed chiefly of helium-4 nuclei. Due to the very long time this process takes, it is not <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> origin of the observed helium white dwarfs. Rather, they are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> product of mass loss in binary systems or mass loss due to a large planetary companion.|$|E
