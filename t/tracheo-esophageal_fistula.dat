50|$|Esophageal atresia with <b>tracheo-esophageal</b> <b>fistula</b> (TE fistula) is seen {{in about}} 70 percent of {{patients}} with VACTERL association, although it can frequently occur as an isolated defect. Fifteen percent to 33 percent of patients with TE fistulas will also have congenital heart disease. However these babies usually have uncomplicated heart defects, like a ventricular septal defect, which may not require any surgery.|$|E
50|$|A fistula, {{from the}} Latin meaning 'a pipe', is an {{abnormal}} connection running either between two tubes or between a tube and a surface. In <b>tracheo-esophageal</b> <b>fistula</b> it runs between the trachea and the esophagus. This connection {{may or may}} not have a central cavity; if it does, then food within the esophagus may pass into the trachea (and on to the lungs) or alternatively, air in the trachea may cross into the esophagus.|$|E
50|$|In vertebrates, {{functional}} differentiation continues {{even after}} birth, with the transformation into the adult phenotype occurring through epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Patterning events that determine tissue differentiation in vertebrates rely on several hox genes, the morphogen sonic hedgehog, and transcription {{factors such as}} sox2 and sox9. Recent {{research has suggested that}} most foregut malformations are due to defects in these signalling pathways, with sonic hedgehog gene knockout mice showing phenotypes similar to those seen in patients with esophageal atresia/stenosis, <b>tracheo-esophageal</b> <b>fistula,</b> and respiratory tract anomalies.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundThe {{most severe}} {{consequence}} of laryngectomy for patients {{is the loss}} of their voice. For this reason, voice rehabilitation has been an integral aspect of treatment after total laryngectomy from the very beginning. A wide variety of different technical and surgical approaches are available and reflect the problems associated with the rehabilitation of communication and swallowing after the removal of the larynx. MethodsWe used Internet search engines and libraries to conduct a search of the current medical literature and historical sources of medical information in order to identify and summarize landmark work on this subject.

40|$|AbstractChildren with {{congenital}} <b>tracheo-esophageal</b> <b>fistula</b> and {{esophageal atresia}} need surgical intervention for their survival. Apart from the several gastro-intestinal and respiratory problems that often follow surgery, {{there is an}} increased risk of impaction of foreign body above the reconstructed esophagus that becomes stenosed and/or dysmotile. Here we illustrate a case of a six-year-old boy who underwent repair of a sporadic form of congenital <b>tracheo-esophageal</b> <b>fistula</b> with esophageal atresia at the age of three months, presenting with impaction of a glass marble above the repaired esophageal segment.

40|$|Objective: To {{review a}} single {{institution}} experience with tracheal stenosis treatment and {{to define a}} role of endotracheal stenting in tracheal reconstruction surgery. Patients and methods: In the period between January 1991 and January 2003, 163 patients underwent tracheal reconstruction. There were 114 males and 49 females in age range from 0. 5 to 79 years (mean 43. 2 years). Indications for reconstruction were: posttracheostomic (PostTS) and postintubation (PostINT) stenoses in 111 cases, tumor-stenosis in 24 cases, <b>tracheo-esophageal</b> <b>fistulas</b> (T-Efist) in 17 cases, traumatic laesions in six and functional stenosis in five cases. For these indications, the following procedures were performed: segmental tracheal resection in 87 cases, stenting in 68 cases (by our own modification of Montgomery T-tube in 65 cases and by other traditional endo-stents in three cases). Primary suture of traumatic tracheal wall was performed in five cases. Three cases involved laser intervention and tumor resections, respectively. Results: Segmental tracheal resection ðn 87 Þ was successful in almost all the cases (96 %). T-tube was applied in 65 cases; the indications included: PostTS and PostINT stenoses in 38 cases, tumors in 17 cases, T-E fistulas in seven cases and functional stenosis in three cases. Twenty-seven patients (41. 6 %) were successfully treated by this modality. In 19 patients (29. 2 %), the stenting is still continuing, but they are candidates for extraction of the T-tube in near future. In 19 patients (29. 2 %) with malignant stenoses, the T-tube was applied only as a palliation. All these patients died due to their underlying malignant disease; the follow-up ranged from 2 to 18 months. Conclusion: Tracheal stenosis is a serious, life-threatening disease with increasin...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Placement of self-expanding {{metallic}} esophageal stent {{in patients}} with advanced esophageal cancer offers excellent palliation of dysphagia and <b>tracheo-esophageal</b> <b>fistulas.</b> However, the safety of stent in patients undergoing radio and/or chemotherapy is controversial, {{in terms of the}} greater risk of complications in cases where these two treatments are used in conjunction. AIM: To assess the use of stent {{in patients with}} advanced cancer of the mid-thoracic esophagus, by comparing patients undergoing cytoreductive therapy with patients who have not undergone this treatment, in relation to improvement in the dysphagia, rate of complications, period of effectiveness and survival time. METHODS: Fifty seven patients were evaluated retrospectively (16 women and 41 men, with an average age 62 years) with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the mid-thoracic esophagus who underwent placement of the Ultraflex self-expandable metallic coated stent, at the Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Unit of São Paulo University Medical School between October 1988 and October 2004. Out of the 57 patients, 24 patients received adjuvant cytoreductive therapy, and 33 patients were only treated with the stent placement. RESULTS: After stent placement, there was improvement in dysphagia in both groups; there were no differences in the rate of complications, such as migration, pain, fistula, obstruction and compression of the airways; the period of effectiveness was significantly higher in the group submitted to cytoreductive therapy (average 123 days compared to 63 days), as was the survival time (average of 210 days, compared with 120 days). CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in dysphagia was statistically significant in both groups, irrespective of whether the patient had undergone adjuvant cytoreductive therapy; there were no differences in the rate of complications between the two groups and both the period of effectiveness of the stent treatment and the survival time were higher in the group with adjuvant cytoreductive therapy...|$|R

40|$|In laryngectomized {{patients}} a <b>tracheo-esophageal</b> artificial <b>fistula</b> {{can be used}} to achieve air flow from the trachea to the esophagus during speech. A one-way plastic valve is often used for the fistula. A free jejunal graft between the trachea and the esophagus can also be used. To avoid aspiration the transplant is attached to the submental area giving the graft a siphon-like shape. We performed 23 videoradiographic examinations using high-density barium in 14 such patients. The aim was to evaluate the protective function of these grafts against aspiration. Penetration of the bolus and a small amount of residual contrast material in the ascending limb of the graft was a normal finding. If the standard barium bolus reached the descending limb {{at any time during the}} examination, this was a sign of aspiration hazard.

40|$|AbstractEsophageal atresia with/without <b>tracheo-esophageal</b> <b>fistula</b> is a {{relatively}} common malformation, occurring in around 1 in 3500 births. In around half of cases, additional malformations are present, forming either a syndrome of known genetic aetiology, or a recognised association, of which the VACTERL association (Vertebral anomalies, Anal atresia, Cardiac malformations, <b>Tracheo-Esophageal</b> <b>fistula,</b> Renal and Limb malformations) is the most recognised. Recently, microdeletions of the FOX gene cluster at 16 q 24. 1, comprising four genes, FOXF 1, MTHFSD, FOXC 2 and FOXL 1, were reported to cause a phenotype resembling VACTERL association, with vertebral anomalies, gastro-intestinal atresias (esophageal, duodenal and anal), congenital heart malformations, and urinary tract malformations, {{as well as a}} rare lethal developmental anomaly of the lung, alveolar capillary dysplasia.
