5|$|There {{have been}} several {{proposals}} to reduce congestion on Oxford Street. Horse-drawn vehicles were banned in 1931, and traffic signals were installed in the same year. To alleviate congestion and help traffic flow of buses, most of Oxford Street is designated a bus lane during peak daytime hours, when private vehicles are banned. It is only open to buses, taxis and two-wheeled vehicles between 7:00am and 7:00pm on all days except Sundays. The ban was introduced experimentally in June 1972. It was considered a success, with an estimated increase of £250,000 in retail sales. In 2009, a new diagonal crossing opened at Oxford Circus, allowing pedestrians to cross from one corner of Oxford Street to the opposite corner without having to cross the road twice or use <b>the</b> <b>pedestrian</b> underpass. This doubles <b>the</b> <b>pedestrian</b> capacity at the junction.|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} a machine vision system to automatically capture <b>the</b> dynamics of <b>pedestrians</b> under four different traffic scenarios. By considering the overhead view of each pedestrian as a digital object, the system processes the image sequences to track <b>the</b> <b>pedestrians.</b> Considering <b>the</b> perspective {{effect of the}} camera lens and the projected area of the hallway at the top-view scene, the distance of each tracked object from its original position to its current position is approximated every video frame. Using the approximated distance and the video frame rate (30 frames per second), the respective velocity and acceleration of each tracked object are later derived. The quantified motion characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>pedestrians</b> are displayed by the system through 2 -dimensional graphs of the kinematics of motion. The system also outputs video images of <b>the</b> <b>pedestrians</b> with superimposed markers for tracking.

5|$|A narrow quay passes {{under the}} old swivel section of the bridge from Waller's Quay to the marina. A well-worn {{handrail}} offers <b>the</b> <b>pedestrian</b> some protection against a slip into the river. This rail has been known as the Duke's Rail since in 1897 the then Duke of York, later to become George V, paid a state visit to Ireland. The royal party travelled up-river from Portumna on the steamship Countess of Mayo. Disembarking at Waller's Quay, the Duke was received by Lord Rosse, the Lord Lieutenant of King's County. The party had to traverse the narrow quay under the bridge to get to Banagher Railway Station, and undoubtedly made good use of the Duke's Rail. The stretch of the Shannon from Portumna to Banagher was {{known for some time}} after as the Duke of York's Route.|$|E
5|$|In May, {{costs for}} {{construction}} of the station were again increased to $4.1 million. The increased costs were primarily associated with the relocation of fiber optic lines during the construction of <b>the</b> <b>pedestrian</b> tunnel. To reduce overall costs, village officials asked for architects to remove the tunnel {{and replace it with}} an elevated walkway over the tracks. In October 2004, the village board gave final approval to the revised station plan with a pedestrian bridge. The $3.2 million estimated cost of the station was to be financed through a pair of federal transportation grants in addition to the village borrowing against its tax incremental financing district from the adjacent industrial park.|$|E

5|$|The {{ground was}} lowered by a full {{story on the}} south and east sides of the station, exposing what had {{formerly}} been the basement to improve access for taxis and private automobiles. A marquee to shelter arriving and departing passengers spanned the seven central bays of the lower level, with a more ornate version on the north end of <b>the</b> <b>pedestrian</b> tunnel. The lower waiting room was expanded, a ticket office constructed, and a larger staircase to the main waiting room was built. The floor was covered with terrazzo and green marble, with white marble wainscoting on the walls. Three bays were added to the west wing for additional functional space, removing direct track access from the ramp. Cast iron streetlights with the PRR Keystone motif in their base were located around the driveway and grounds.|$|E
5|$|Tracks 1 and 3 are {{connected}} {{to each other and}} to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's southbound local track south of Grand Central station.

There is no connection between the two tracks that connect to the Lexington Avenue Line, Tracks 1 and 3, and the track that connects to the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, Track 4; therefore, it is now physically impossible for a train to go from the IRT Lexington Avenue Line through to the IRT Seventh Avenue Line or vice versa by using the shuttle tracks. At the Times Square station, to provide a connection between the platform for Track 4 and the rest of the station complex, there is a pedestrian bridge over Track 4. <b>The</b> <b>pedestrian</b> bridge is temporary removed to allow the train on Track 4 to leave for maintenance.|$|E

The first two closures assume that the velocity distribution functions are either a Dirac delta or a von Mises-Fisher distribution respectively. The third closure results from a hydrodynamic limit associated to a Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium. We develop an analogy between this equilibrium and Nash equilibia in a game theoretic framework.

5|$|As Liberal leader, Thorpe {{provided}} a clear contrast with <b>the</b> <b>pedestrian</b> images of Wilson and Edward Heath, the Conservative leader since March 1965. He was considerably younger, {{and much more}} telegenic. His first years of leadership were problematic; he found himself {{at odds with the}} Young Liberals, who were advocating policies far {{to the left of the}} Liberal mainstream. Their demands for workers' control in nationalised industries, British withdrawal from NATO, and massive cuts in the defence budget, caused bitter disputes within the party and damaged its public image. At this time the political climate was not conducive to radical policies; the Wilson government's rapid descent into unpopularity brought a sharp swing to the right among voters. The beneficiaries were the Conservatives, who made spectacular by-election gains at Labour's expense while the Liberals failed to make any real impact. Discontent against Thorpe's leadership was being voiced within a year of his election, culminating in June 1968 when disaffected senior party members combined with Young Liberals in an attempt to depose him. Thorpe had just married Caroline Allpass, and was abroad on honeymoon when the plotters struck. The timing of their attempted coup, widely seen in and out of the party as treachery, ensured that on Thorpe's return the party executive backed him by 48 votes to 2.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, Skanska {{was awarded}} the $150-million design–build {{contract}} to build the new bridge. Skanska started driving test pilings into {{the ground in the}} later part of 2008. In May 2009, public voting for the aesthetic design features of the bridge decided that the cables would be blue, the pylon tops would be slanted with railings, and the lighting fixtures for the walkway would have a nautical theme. The test pilings for the bridge were completed in June 2009. Construction of the pylons began in July 2009 with the pouring of concrete into the first pylon. By December 2009, construction had begun on the approach foundations and the edge girders, with work continuing on the pylon towers and the side abutments. The completion of the design phase of the project {{and the beginning of the}} concrete pour for the bridge deck took place in April 2010.

5|$|Most of her {{commissions}} {{were carried}} out during the 12 years or so {{between the end of}} the First World War and the start of the Great Depression. She took on several major projects, including designing the landscape of the University of Delaware campus in 1919 at the recommendation of Sharp, who chaired the college's Buildings and Grounds Committee. From 1918 to 1952, Coffin was appointed the University of Delaware’s landscape architect, a position which required Coffin to unite the university’s two separate campuses (the former Delaware College to the north and the Delaware Women’s College to the south) into one cohesive design. This was a challenge since the linear mall design of each was out of alignment with the other. Coffin solved this problem by linking them via a circle instead of curving the straight paths (the university’s library faces this circle today) which rendered the misalignment unnoticeable to <b>the</b> <b>pedestrian.</b>|$|E
25|$|Resonant {{vibrational}} modes due to {{vertical loads}} (such as trains, traffic, pedestrians) and wind loads are well understood in bridge design.
