500|$|In 2011, the BBC apologised after Grant made an offhand {{joke about}} {{homosexuality}} and rugby {{when he was}} invited into the commentary box during coverage of an England vs Scotland game at Twickenham Stadium. Talking about playing rugby during his school days, Grant said: [...] "I discovered it hurt less if you tackled hard <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> tackled like a queen." ...|$|E
500|$|Backbreakers close [...] "on the field" [...] {{camera was}} also panned by critics. [...] "Because the camera places you {{right on the}} field, all of the hits carry even more weight <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were zoomed farther back, but the {{positive}} aspects are overshadowed by an inability to see the entire field," [...] said GameSpot's review of Backbreaker, while GameZone added that [...] "Backbreaker uses a tight third-person view that brings the player closer to the action. The results are visually interesting, but the mechanics are mismanaged. While the game strives to be as simple and as straightforward as possible, the camera often gets in the way." ...|$|E

500|$|One of the {{challenges}} the writers faced was scaling down their ideas to make them feasible for production. [...] Cuse said that he let such ideas flourish because of his relative inexperience with writing for television series. An example given by the writers was Boam's idea for a full-sized [...] "pirate ship on wheels". The writers quickly realized they needed to scale the idea down to something the production designers could create. They settled on putting a full pirate crew on a stagecoach with cannons. Kern said {{it was better to}} [...] "shoot past the mark, and come back to it, rather than start below it". He elaborated on this, saying, [...] "if you envision the 40-foot galleon and go back from that, you'll always end up with more <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> start out with a pirate on a horse." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before the First World War, {{the family}} moved to Shiplake, Oxfordshire where Eric became {{friendly}} with the Buddicom family, especially their daughter Jacintha. When they first met, he was standing on his head in a field. On being asked why, he said, [...] "You are noticed more if you stand on your head <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are right way up." [...] Jacintha and Eric read and wrote poetry, and dreamed of becoming famous writers. He said that he might write a book in the style of H. G. Wells's A Modern Utopia. During this period, he also enjoyed shooting, fishing and birdwatching with Jacintha's brother and sister.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2009, Obama reiterated his anti-outsourcing {{views and}} criticised the current US tax policy [...] "that says you should pay lower taxes if {{you create a}} job in Bangalore, India, <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> create one in Buffalo, New York." [...] However, during the US India Business Council meeting in June 2009, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton {{advocated}} for stronger economic ties between India and the United States. She also rebuked protectionist policies, saying that [...] " [...] will not use the global financial crisis {{as an excuse to}} fall back on protectionism. We hope India will work with us to create a more open, equitable set of opportunities for trade between our nations." ...|$|E
2500|$|An earlier {{agreement}} {{stated that}} {{each member of}} the LLC would only receive [...] "sole compensation for many years of service, a golden parachute of $20,000." [...] But the members now agreed to an arrangement whereby {{each member of the}} LLC would receive an undisclosed sum prior to the transfer of their ownership rights to the Burning Man Project. Marian Goodell, board member and head of communication, addressed concerns about the lack of transparency with this statement: [...] "When you’re {{in the middle of a}} storm, if you’re going to explain all of how you got there, and how you’re going to get out, it often sets more panic among the survivors <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> just sail the boat out of the darkness." ...|$|E
