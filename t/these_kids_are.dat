25|$|In October 2010, The Forward {{reported}} on {{the current state of}} Jews and the level of antisemitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and {{professor of history at the}} University of Lund, stated that members of the Swedish Riksdag have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic—not just anti-Israel. Charles Small, former director of the Yale University Initiative for the Study of Anti-Semitism, stated that “Sweden is a microcosm of contemporary anti-Semitism. It’s a form of acquiescence to radical Islam, which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for.” Per Gudmundson, chief editorial writer for Svenska Dagbladet and well known for his pro-Israeli stance for decades, has sharply criticised politicians who he says offer “weak excuses” for Muslims accused of antisemitic crimes. “Politicians say <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> poor and oppressed, and we have made them hate. They are, in effect, saying that the behaviour of these kids is in some way our fault.” Much of the anti-semitism in the country has been attributed to the growing Muslim immigrant population.|$|E
500|$|Amelia Gentleman of The Guardian {{described}} Lohan as [...] "better {{known for}} what is euphemistically termed a party lifestyle" [...] and said that while her participation did bring publicity to the project, the attention was uniformly negative and about her person, not the issues. Of the documentary she said that [...] "the material is potent and persuasive", but that Lohan was a [...] "constant, distracting presence". Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote a satirical, mocking letter ostensibly {{from the point of}} view of Lohan: [...] "Some of <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> sent to work when they're so young. Which I can relate to because I started out working as a child model aged three, and got into movies when I was 11. I can, like, so totally understand where these people are coming from".|$|E
500|$|Since Dexter {{producers}} try {{to shield}} the child actors {{as much as possible}} from the show's dark subject matter, executive producer Daniel Cerone urged the mother of his son's friend not to let her son audition to play a young Dexter, who is filmed sitting in a pool of blood. Erik King found the shot of the boy crying in the blood to be the creepiest moment of the first season. He described it as [...] "very uncomfortable to watch, even when you know it's not real and you know <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> actors." [...] Cinematographer Romeo Tirone tightened the camera's shutter angle when filming these scenes to make them [...] "feel like fragments of memory - subjective, with tight close-ups against an indistinct background. You don't see all the details of the environment." [...] Series director Keith Gordon found these flashbacks [...] "incredible" [...] because he thought they were [...] "like a Stanley Kubrick movie".|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{noted the}} {{similarities}} between the Iraqi boys and those from Western cultures. Peter Scarlet, the artistic director at the Tribeca Film Festival, said, [...] "What's fascinating about the film that resulted is how very familiar and ordinary <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> – they're not really all that different from your own teenagers or the kids you went to school with. The kids of Baghdad High also open us up to a very different sense of life in Iraq than what we've been seeing on the nightly news for five years." [...] The Huffington Post said, [...] "previously it had been unfathomable that students in Baghdad might be experiencing the same ephemeral and narcissistic heartbreak as we are in the United States." [...] Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, [...] "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will seem instantly familiar to anyone who has spent time around a teenage boy. They like to wrestle each other, love Western music, dream big and have trouble buckling down in school." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Los Gatos {{released}} {{their first}} single, [...] "La balsa", backed with [...] "Ayer nomás". The song catapulted the burgeoning [...] "rock nacional" [...] scene in Buenos Aires, establishing the commercial viability of rock music sung in Spanish, and turning what originally was an underground scene into a widespread youth culture phenomenon. [...] "La balsa" [...] sold over 250,000 copies, an impressive number for that time, {{especially for a}} song with Spanish lyrics that differed from the cheerful and shallow efforts of the contemporary nueva ola movement. Spinetta stated: [...] "We were with Emilio [...] {{in front of the}} television, a Saturday afternoon, when we heard [...] "La balsa". Then we said, [...] "but <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> awesome... let's be hippies from tomorrow!" [...] After a Los Gatos concert, Spinetta met producer Ricardo Kleiman and invited him to the band's rehearsals. When Kleiman heard the band play he signed them to RCA Records, and in November 1968 Almendra released their first single: [...] "Tema de Pototo", backed with [...] "El mundo entre las manos". Almendra began playing live, with performances during the summer of 1969 in Mar del Plata and an appearance at the Ancón Festival in Peru. Their Buenos Aires debut was at the Di Tella Institute as part of Three Beat Shows, where they introduced [...] "Fermín", [...] "Ana no duerme" [...] and [...] "Que el viento borró tus manos", songs which would appear on their first studio album. Almendra released a second single, [...] "Hoy todo el hielo en la ciudad" [...] backed with [...] "Campos verdes"; it was also released in Peru, where it was more successful than it was in Argentina. Between April and September 1969, the band recorded their first LP at TNT Studios, Buenos Aires, while a third single ("Tema de Pototo", backed with [...] "Final") was released. At the time of Almendras release, the influence of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones had overshadowed the success of the nueva ola, exemplified by the popular teen pop music TV show, El Club del Clan.|$|E

[...] Judith Popinski, and 86-year-old Holocaust survivor, stated that she is no longer invited to schools that have a large Muslim presence to tell her story of surviving the Holocaust. Popinski, who found refuge in Malmö in 1945, stated that, until recently, she told her story in Malmö schools as part of their Holocaust studies program, but that now, many schools no longer ask Holocaust survivors to tell their stories, because Muslim students treat them with such disrespect, either ignoring the speakers or walking out of the class. She further stated, [...] "Malmö reminds me of the anti-Semitism I felt as a child in Poland before the war. [...] "I am not safe as a Jew in Sweden anymore." ...|$|E
