50|$|Pistol Case, Royal Tank Corps (1916-1939) / Royal Armoured Corps (1939-Present): A straight-draw thigh holster worn on {{the right}} thigh that was used by Tank commanders to carry the Enfield No 2 Revolver. It had a long strap that allowed it to extend to the upper leg and a <b>tie-down</b> <b>strap</b> on the holster to secure it. It had six {{cartridge}} loops {{on the side of}} the holster to hold spare ammunition and a cleaning rod pocket along the front edge. There are pictures showing Commandos wearing a cross-draw shoulder holster worn under the left armpit made from a converted version of this rig.|$|E
5000|$|The McGuire Rig was {{fashioned}} from a 2 in wide, 15 ft long A7A nylon cargo <b>tie-down</b> <b>strap</b> with a quick-fit buckle on one end. This was typically cut {{down to an}} 8 ft length and a 18 in web loop (wrist strap) attached near the top end. This was used to form a sling loop and attached to an over 100 ft length of 5/8-inch nylon rope. Three ropes with McGuire Rigs attached could be dropped from a UH-1 [...] "Huey" [...] helicopter, {{all on the same}} side. A deployment pack containing a sandbag carried each rope to the ground. A soldier attached his rucksack with a snap link, stepped into the loop, adjusted it, inserted his left hand in the wrist loop, and on signal the helicopter lifted off. The three men would lock arms to prevent oscillation and prevent falls if a rope were shot through; a wounded or unconscious man could fall from the harness unless secured. The system did not allow the extracted soldiers to be hoisted into the helicopter. They were flown out of the danger area and then set down in a clearing in order to board the helicopter. On a long flight the harness proved to be extremely uncomfortable.|$|E
40|$|The {{vibration}} {{test for the}} ES- 3 100 package {{is designed to simulate}} the environmental effects of the vibration regime that the ES- 3 100 will experience during use. A Lansmont model 10000 - 10 vibration table was used to perform the testing. A vibration spectrum simulating the Safe-Secure Trailer/Safeguards Transporter (SST/SGT) was used. The test duration was based on the longest trip that the package is likely to endure, namely one hour per 1000 trip-miles. Hence, the 4 -h test duration used was conservative and should encompass any conceivable trip that the ES- 3100 might undergo. The vibration controller was programmed to the power spectrum density shown in Table 3. 1. After having undergone the water spray test, free drop, penetration test, and the compression test, TU- 4 was securely strapped to the vibration table with a nylon <b>tie-down</b> <b>strap</b> (as specified in the test plan) to begin the 4 -hour test (Figure 3. 5) ...|$|E
50|$|A park model {{usually has}} steel <b>tie-down</b> <b>straps</b> for {{attachment}} to ground anchors. These are often required to satisfy local zoning and/or mobile home park regulations.|$|R
50|$|On a canoe, the spraydeck is {{secured to}} the outside of the hull with string or cords to a webbing {{specifically}} installed for this purpose. Modern designs have many features for safety and convenience such as map and paddle pockets, access openings, and <b>tie-down</b> <b>straps.</b>|$|R
500|$|Other {{examples}} include Gordie Howe's tactic {{of holding the}} sweater of his opponent right around the armpit of his preferred punching arm so as to impede his movement. Probert, of the Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Blackhawks, was known to allow his opponents to punch until they showed signs of tiring, at which time he would take over and usually dominate the fight. Some consider long-time Buffalo Sabres enforcer Rob Ray to be the reason that hockey jerseys are now equipped with <b>tie-down</b> <b>straps</b> ("fight straps") that prevent their removal; he would always remove his jersey during fights so his opponents would have nothing to grab on to. This is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Rob Ray Rule".|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} is surveyed to determine human tolerance to rapidly applied accelerations. Pertinent {{human and animal}} experiments applicable to space flight and to crash impact forces are analyzed and discussed. These data are compared and presented {{on the basis of}} a trapezoidal pulse. The effects of body restraint and of acceleration direction, onset rate, and plateau duration on the maximum tolerable and survivable rapidly applied accelerations are shown. Results of the survey indicate that adequate torso and extremity restraint is the primary variable in tolerance to rapidly applied accelerations. The harness, or restraint system, must be arranged to transmit the major portion of the accelerating force directly to the pelvic structure and not via the vertebral column. When the conditions of adequate restraint have been met, then the other variables, direction, magnitude, and onset rate of rapidly applied accelerations, govern maximum tolerance and injury limits. The results also indicate that adequately stressed aft-faced passenger seats offer maximum complete body support with minimum objectionable harnessing. Such a seat, whether designed for 20 -, 30 -, or 40 -G dynamic loading, would include lap strap, chest (axillary) strap, and winged-back seat to increase headward and lateral G protection, full-height integral head rest, arm rests (load-bearing) with recessed hand-holds and provisions to prevent arms from slipping either laterally or beyond the seat back, and leg support to keep the legs from being wedged under the seat. For crew members and others whose duties require forward-facing seats, maximum complete body support requires lap, shoulder, and thigh straps, lap-belt <b>tie-down</b> <b>strap,</b> and full-height seat back with integral head support...|$|E
2500|$|From 1943 to 1945 a fine-grade russet-leather M1916 pistol belt set {{was issued}} to some generals in the US Army. It was {{composed}} of a leather belt, leather enclosed flap-holster with braided leather <b>tie-down</b> leg <b>strap,</b> leather two-pocket magazine pouch, and a rope neck lanyard. The metal buckle and fittings were in gilded brass. The buckle had the seal of the U.S. on the center (or [...] "male") piece and a laurel wreath on the circular (or [...] "female") piece. The pistol was a standard-issue M1911A1 that came with a cleaning kit and three magazines.|$|R
50|$|For {{practicing}} quick-draw extensively, {{the very}} best bet is a Jordan holster sewn to a wide stout belt, with <b>tie-down</b> <b>straps</b> to secure {{the bottom of the}} holster firmly to your leg. It is best to prep a new quick-draw holster by putting the gun inside of six or seven gallon-size Ziploc bags and sealing each one, then wetting the holster thoroughly in a bucket of warm water with a little soap in it and jamming the gun into the holster to shape it, then letting the holster dry completely. Without the bags, the gun will be a loose fit in the holster. For uniformed police-officers, it does them good to learn how to unsnap the safety strap, which is snapped across the hammer to lock the gun into the holster, {{as an integral part of}} the quick-draw, without slowing or stopping the hand in that process. (Do not use a thumb-break safety strap for quick-draw.) A shoe-repair shop can sew a small bent-up piece of sheet metal to the bottom of the tag-end of the safety strap to hold it away from the holster and enable the extended fingers sweeping up the side of the holster to pop the snap on the safety strap so that it will fly up out of the way as the hand draws the gun.|$|R
