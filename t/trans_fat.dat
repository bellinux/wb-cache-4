5|$|Initially, Sanders and KFC used {{hydrogenated}} {{vegetable oil}} for frying, {{but in the}} 1980s the company began to switch to cheaper oils such as palm or soybean. In the 2000s {{it became apparent that}} these oils contain relatively high levels of <b>trans</b> <b>fat,</b> which increases the risk of heart disease. By April 2007, the chain had switched to trans fat-free soybean oil in all of its US outlets.|$|E
25|$|Up to 45% of {{the total}} fat in those foods {{containing}} artificial trans fats formed by partially hydrogenating plant fats may be <b>trans</b> <b>fat.</b> Baking shortenings, unless reformulated, contain around 30% trans fats compared to their total fats. High-fat dairy products such as butter contain about 4%. Margarines not reformulated to reduce trans fats may contain up to 15% <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> by weight, but some reformulated ones are less than 1% <b>trans</b> <b>fat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since December 2005, Health Canada has {{required}} that food labels list {{the amount of}} <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> in the nutrition facts section for most foods. Products with less than 0.2nbsp&grams of <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> per serving may be labeled as free of trans fats. These labelling allowances are not widely known, but as an awareness of them develops, controversy over truthful labelling is growing. In Canada, <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> quantities on labels include naturally occurring trans fats from animal sources.|$|E
2500|$|Although <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> are edible, {{consumption}} of <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> {{has been shown}} to increase the risk of coronary artery disease in part by raising levels of the lipoprotein LDL (often referred to as [...] "bad cholesterol"), lowering levels of the lipoprotein HDL (often referred to as [...] "good cholesterol"), increasing triglycerides in the bloodstream and promoting systemic inflammation. <b>Trans</b> <b>fats</b> also occur naturally in a limited number of cases. Vaccenyl and conjugated linoleyl (CLA) containing <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> occur naturally in trace amounts in meat and dairy products from ruminants. Most artificial <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> are chemically different from natural <b>trans</b> <b>fats.</b>|$|R
25|$|In July 2008, California {{became the}} first state to ban <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> in {{restaurants}} effective 1 January 2010; Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the bill into law. California restaurants are prohibited from using oil, shortening, and margarine containing artificial <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> in spreads or for frying, with the exception of deep frying doughnuts. As of 1 January 2011, doughnuts and other baked goods have been prohibited from containing artificial <b>trans</b> <b>fats.</b> Packaged foods are not covered by the ban and can legally contain <b>trans</b> <b>fats.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Unlike other dietary <b>fats,</b> <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> are not essential, {{and they}} do not promote good health. The {{consumption}} of <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> increases one's risk of coronary heart disease by raising levels of [...] "bad" [...] LDL cholesterol and lowering levels of [...] "good" [...] HDL cholesterol. <b>Trans</b> <b>fats</b> from partially hydrogenated oils are more harmful than naturally occurring oils.|$|R
25|$|Resolution 360 of 23 December 2003 by the Brazilian {{ministry}} of health required {{for the first time}} in the country that the amount of <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> to be specified in labels of food products. On 31 July 2006, such labelling of <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> contents became mandatory. In 2007 the ministry established a target to reduce the total amount of <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> in any industrialized food sold in Brazil to a maximum of 2% by the end of 2010.|$|E
25|$|Since August 2006 food {{products}} should be labelled {{with the amount}} of <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> in them. Since 2010 vegetable oils and fats directly sold to consumers must only contain 2% of <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> over total fat, and other food must contain less than 5% of their total fat. Starting on 10 December 2014, Argentina has on effect a total ban on food with <b>trans</b> <b>fat,</b> a move that could save the government more than US$100 million a year on healthcare.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of these}} facts and concerns, the NAS has {{concluded}} {{there is no}} safe level of <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> consumption. There is no adequate level, recommended daily amount or tolerable upper limit for trans fats. This is because any incremental increase in <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> intake {{increases the risk of}} coronary artery disease.|$|E
40|$|Manufacturers use {{the process}} of {{hydrogenation}} to create <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> {{in order to increase}} the shelf life of baked and fried foods. Ingestion of <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. A groundswell of public sentiment is causing regulatory bodies to ban the use of <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> in foods. Alternatives to <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> are needed now in order to preserve the freshness and provide an appealing texture of many packaged foods. As <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> become phased out, there are eight types of approaches currently being developed to substitute for these fats as ingredients for baked and fried foods: (1) modified hydrogenation, (2) genetically modified seeds, (3) interesterification, (4) fractionation and blending, (5) butter and animal fat, (6) natural saturated oils, (7) natural unsaturated oils, and (8) fat substitutes. These alternatives to <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> will require close scrutiny to ascertain whether they will also turn out to be linked with cardiovascular disease...|$|R
2500|$|In 2003 the World Health Organisation {{recommended}} that <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> make up {{no more than}} 1% of a person's diet. In 2013, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a preliminary determination that partially hydrogenated oils (which contain <b>trans</b> <b>fats)</b> are not [...] "generally recognized as safe", which was expected {{to lead to a}} ban on industrially produced <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> in the American diet. On 16 June 2015, the FDA finalized its determination that <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> are not generally recognized as safe, and set a three-year time limit for their removal from all processed foods.|$|R
2500|$|On 7 November 2013, the FDA {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} determination that <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> are not [...] "generally recognized as safe", which was {{widely seen as}} a precursor to a reclassification of <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> as a [...] "food additive," [...] meaning {{they could not be}} used in foods without specific regulatory authorization. This would have the effect of virtually eliminating <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> from the US food supply. The ruling was formally enacted on 16 June 2015, requiring that within three years, all food prepared in the United States must not include <b>trans</b> <b>fats,</b> unless approved by the FDA.|$|R
25|$|Researchers at the United States Department of Agriculture have {{investigated}} whether hydrogenation {{can be achieved}} without the side effect of <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> production. They varied the pressure under which the chemical reaction was conducted— applying 1400kPa (200psi) of pressure to soybean oil in a 2-liter vessel while heating it to between 140°C and 170°C. The standard 140kPa (20psi) process of hydrogenation produces a product of about 40% trans fatty acid by weight, compared to about 17% using the high-pressure method. Blended with unhydrogenated liquid soybean oil, the high-pressure-processed oil produced margarine containing 5 to 6% <b>trans</b> <b>fat.</b> Based on current U.S. labeling requirements (see below), the manufacturer could claim the product was free of <b>trans</b> <b>fat.</b> The level of <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> may also be altered by modification of the temperature {{and the length of}} time during hydrogenation.|$|E
25|$|Trans fats {{are used}} in {{shortenings}} for deep-frying in restaurants, {{as they can be}} used for longer than most conventional oils before becoming rancid. In the early 21st century, non-hydrogenated vegetable oils that have lifespans exceeding that of the frying shortenings became available. As fast-food chains routinely use different fats in different locations, <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> levels in fast food can have large variations. For example, an analysis of samples of McDonald's French fries collected in 2004 and 2005 found that fries served in New York City contained twice as much <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> as in Hungary, and 28 times as much as in Denmark, where trans fats are restricted. At KFC, the pattern was reversed, with Hungary's product containing twice the <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> of the New York product. Even within the United States there was variation, with fries in New York containing 30% more <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> than those from Atlanta.|$|E

40|$|Mensink and Katan {{showed in}} 1990 that <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> reduce high- and {{increase}} low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

The decision in 1994 to remove <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> from Unilever's retail spreads was triggered by media events, but it was built on a solid understanding of the nutritional and technological aspects of <b>trans</b> <b>fats.</b> Over the next 14 years, manufacturers worldwide followed suit.

25|$|The exact {{biochemical}} {{process by which}} trans fats produce specific health problems are a topic of continuing research. One {{theory is that the}} human lipase enzyme works only on the cis configuration and cannot metabolize a <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> although this theory has been overturned by the recognition that <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> is metabolized but competitively inhibits the metabolism of other fatty acids. Intake of dietary <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> perturbs the body's ability to metabolize essential fatty acids (EFAs including Omega 3) leading to changes in the phospholipid fatty acid composition in the aorta, the main artery of the heart, thereby increasing risk of coronary artery disease.|$|E
25|$|Diabetes: There is {{a growing}} concern that the risk of type 2 {{diabetes}} increases with <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> consumption. However, consensus has not been reached. For example, one study found that risk is higher for those in the highest quartile of <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> consumption. Another study has found no diabetes risk once other factors such as total fat intake and BMI were accounted for.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol ratio: This ratio {{compares the}} levels of LDL to HDL. <b>Trans</b> <b>fat</b> behaves like {{saturated}} fat by raising the level of LDL, but, unlike saturated fat, it has the additional effect of decreasing levels of HDL. The net increase in LDL/HDL ratio with <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> is approximately double that due to saturated fat. (Higher ratios are worse.) One randomized crossover study published in 2003 comparing the effect of eating a meal on blood lipids of (relatively) cis and <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> rich meals showed that cholesteryl ester transfer (CET) was 28% higher after the trans meal than after the cis meal and that lipoprotein concentrations were enriched in apolipoprotein(a) after the trans meals.|$|E
25|$|However, when {{partially}} hydrogenated, {{part of the}} unsaturated {{fatty acids}} become unhealthy <b>trans</b> <b>fats.</b> Consumers are increasingly avoiding products that contain <b>trans</b> <b>fats,</b> and governments have begun to ban <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> in food products. These regulations and market pressures have spurred the development of low-α-linolenic acid soybeans. These new soybean varieties yield a more stable oil that doesn't require hydrogenation for many applications, thus providing trans fat-free products, such as frying oil.|$|R
25|$|Studies in {{the early}} 1990s, however, brought renewed {{scrutiny}} and confirmation of the negative health impact of <b>trans</b> <b>fats.</b> In 1994, {{it was estimated that}} <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> caused 20,000 deaths annually in the United States from heart disease.|$|R

25|$|The J.M. Smucker Company, American {{manufacturer}} of Crisco (the original partially hydrogenated vegetable shortening), in 2004 released a new formulation made from solid saturated palm oil cut with soybean oil and sunflower oil. This blend yielded an equivalent shortening {{much like the}} previous partially hydrogenated Crisco, and was labelled zero grams of <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> per 1 tablespoon serving (as compared with 1.5grams per tablespoon of original Crisco). As of 24 January 2007, Smucker claims that all Crisco shortening products in the US have been reformulated to contain less than one gram of <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> per serving while keeping saturated fat content less than butter.

50|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that {{unsaturated}} fats, particularly monounsaturated fats, are best in the human diet. Saturated fats, typically from animal sources, are next, while <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> are to be avoided.

50|$|In {{the mid to}} late 2000s, the {{consumer}} trend of avoiding <b>trans</b> <b>fats,</b> and mandatory labeling of <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> in some jurisdictions, sparked an increase in the consumption of cottonseed oil, with some health experts and public health agencies recommending it as a healthy oil. Crisco and other producers have been able to reformulate cottonseed oil so it contains little to no <b>trans</b> <b>fats.</b> Still, some health experts claim that cottonseed oil’s high ratio of polyunsaturated fats to monounsaturated fats and processed nature make it unhealthy.|$|R

25|$|Critics of the plan, {{including}} FDA advisor Dr. Carlos Camargo, {{have expressed}} concern that the 0.5gram per serving threshold is too high to refer to a food as free of <b>trans</b> <b>fat.</b> This is because a person eating many servings of a product, or eating multiple products {{over the course of the}} day may still consume a significant amount of <b>trans</b> <b>fat.</b> Despite this, the FDA estimates that by 2009, <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> labeling will have prevented from 600 to 1,200 cases of coronary artery disease and 250 to 500 deaths each year.
