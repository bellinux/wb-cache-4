50|$|A <b>Tetratype</b> is a tetrad {{containing}} {{four different}} genotypes, two parental and two recombinant. A spore arrangement in Ascomycetes {{that consists of}} two parental and two recombinant spores indicates a single crossover between two linked loci.|$|E
50|$|The tetrad is {{the four}} spores of a yeast, other Ascomycota or Chlamydomonas {{produced}} after meiosis. After parent haploids mate, they produce diploids. Under appropriate environmental conditions, diploids sporulate and undergo meiosis. The meiotic products, spores, remain packaged in the parental cell body {{to produce the}} tetrad.If the two parents have a mutation in two different genes, the tetrad can segregate these genes as the parental ditype (PD), the non-parental ditype (NPD) or as the <b>tetratype</b> (TT).|$|E
40|$|Genetic data {{suggesting}} {{the absence of}} crossover in Saccharomycodes ludwigii have been described. Tetrad data obtained from 888 asci from 60 pairs of genes with 22 genetic markers showed the absence of <b>tetratype</b> asci, except for 5 asci in which {{a single pair of}} alleles showed <b>tetratype</b> segregation to the other genetic markers in each ascus. Spore arrays in the linear asci showed that the + - + - and + - - + (or - + + -) asci occurred at almost equal frequencies. The two coherent spores at each end of an ascus were always marked with different alleles of a gene...|$|E
40|$|The progeny of crosses between {{wild-type}} {{strains of}} Phycomyces {{usually do not}} exhibit all of the expected genotypes from meiosis. By backcrossing, we have isolated a new (+) mating-type strain, A 56, which is nearly isogenic with the (-) wild-type NRRL 1555 commonly used in Phycomyces research. Tetrad analysis of the backcrosses shows that meiosis becomes more regular as the parental (+) and (-) strains become more isogenic. In our two-factor crosses with unlinked markers, the regularity of meiosis is measured as the percent of reciprocal ditypes plus <b>tetratypes</b> in the progeny. We have shown that this percentage increases from about 15 % for crosses between nonisogenic parents to 90 % in the eighth backcross. The results indicate that routine, reliable recombination analyses are possible in P. blakesleeanus...|$|R
40|$|The {{atypical}} {{structure and}} behavior of dinoflagellate chromosomes suggests that the genetics of these organisms might show comparable peculiarities. We have begun genetic analysis of the neritic, marine heterotroph Crypthecodinium (Gyrodinium) cohnii by means of motility mutants that show complementation shortly after zygote formation, permitting identification of heterozygotes. Six mutations, conferring four microscopically distinguishable phenotypes, have been isolated and investigated. These "genes" were found to complement in double heterozygotes in all pairwise combinations, indicating that the lesions are recessive and non-allelic. Clones of all possible combinations of these factors have been established and each complements only those combinations expected {{on the assumption that}} there are six independent recessive mutant "genes. " Tetrad analysis following isolation of over 200 complementing zygotes showed: (1) regular segregation with recovery of parental phenotypes and genotypes; (2) independent assortment, with one possible exception; (3) segregations that were always 1 : 1, that is, in all tetrads showing recombination, only the two reciprocal recombinant genotypes were found; there were no <b>tetratypes.</b> This behavior could result from centromere linkage or the absence of crossing over in an otherwise conventional meiosis, or it could result from an unusual one-division "meiosis. " Some evidence is provided that favors the latter hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|The gol- 1, gol- 2, alb- 1 and spa- 1 {{mutations}} affect pigment {{pattern in}} the zebrafish. We show here that these loci are unlinked to each other. In addition, gene-centromere distances were determined for these loci by analysis of halftetrads obtained by the inhibition of the second meiotic division. The fractions of <b>tetratype</b> (second-division segregation) tetrads range from 0. 24 (spa- 1) to 0. 89 (gol- 1). The observation of > 0. 67 second-division segregation indicates that the zebrafish has high chiasma interference...|$|E
40|$|A cis-dominant {{mutation}} {{linked to}} argF, the structural gene specifying ornithine carbamoyltransferase, and affecting {{the control of}} the synthesis of this enzyme has been obtained. The level of ornithine carbamoyltransferase in this mutation is depressed and less repressible by addition of L-arginine {{than it is in the}} wild-type strain. Of 38 tetrads analyzed, resulting from a cross of a strain harboring this mutation with a strain carrying an argF- mutation, none was a <b>tetratype</b> or a nonparental ditype. This operator mutation helps to define a negative mode of control of the synthesis of the arginine biosynthetic enzymes, as had been suggested earlier upon the isolation of argRI- (arg 80), argRII- (arg 81), and argRIII- (arg 82) specific regulatory mutations...|$|E
40|$|A naphthazarin-producing (fusarubin, novarubin, javanicin, norjavanicin), highly {{pathogenic}} {{strain of}} Nectria haematococca (sexual state of Fusarium solani var. martii) was crossed with a non-naphthazarin-producing, slightly pathogenic mutant strain. This cross and several backcrosses were studied by unordered tetrad analysis. In all tetrads a 4 : 4 ratio of naphthazarin-producing ascospore strains to non-naphthazarin-producing ones resulted. By two-factor analysis for this {{character and the}} markers determining mating type, sexual type, colonial growth, and perithecial colour respectively, parental-ditype, non-parental-ditype, and <b>tetratype</b> tetrads resulted. This indicates {{that the loss of}} the capacity to produce naphthazarins is due to a mutation at a single locus, which probably blocks the biosynthesis of a polyketide precursor. When the same tetrads were tested for pathogenicity, the strains could not be classified into a group with high pathogenicity and one with low pathogenicity, as they showed intermediate degrees of pathogenicity. It is therefore concluded that the degree of pathogenicity is polygenically inherited. The difference in the inheritance of the capacity to produce naphthazarins and of pathogenicity, as well as the appearance of highly pathogenic though non-naphthazarin-producing segregants, indicates that the capacity to produce novarubin, fusarubin, javanicin, and norjavanicin is not {{a major factor in the}} determination of a high degree of pathogenicit...|$|E
40|$|Genetically defined {{strains of}} the yeast Hansenula polymorpha were {{constructed}} from a clone of H. polymorpha CBS 4732 with very low mating and sporulation abilities. Mating, spore viability, {{and the percentage of}} four-spore-containing asci were increased to a level at which tetrad analysis was possible. Auxotrophic mutations in 30 genes were isolated and used to construct strains with multiple markers for mapping studies, transformation with plasmid DNA, and mutant screening. Various other types of mutants were isolated and characterized, among them mutants that displayed an altered morphology, methanol-utilization deficient mutants and strains impaired in the biosynthesis of alcohol oxidase and catalase. Also, the mutability of H. polymorpha CBS 4732 vs H. polymorpha NCYC 495 was compared. The data revealed clear differences in frequencies of appearance and mutational spectra of some mutants isolated. Many of the mutants isolated had good mating abilities, and diploids resulting from their crossing displayed high sporulation frequencies and high spore viability. Most of the markers used revealed normal Mendelian segregation during meiosis. The frequency of <b>tetratype</b> spore formation was lower than in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggesting a lower frequency of recombination during the second meiotic division. The properties of genetically defined strains of H. polymorpha CBS 4732 as well as their advantages for genetics and molecular studies are discussed. ...|$|E
