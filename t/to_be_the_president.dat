5|$|In {{the fifth}} episode, {{president}} Teikun Ō is found dead, and Bansai attempts to rig Miwa's trial in her favor by manipulating Mikagami through {{the kidnapping of}} her adopted son, Shimon Aizawa. Edgeworth prevents this, and investigates the murder, learning that Teikun Ō has been dead for twelve years: the person previously thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> was a body double, who had hired Hōinbō to kill the president to take his place, and was helped by Miwa and Bansai {{to cover up the}} crime. Sarushiro is revealed to be Kazami's long lost son; as a child, he was abducted by Hyōdō to prevent Kazami from winning the cooking contest. Hyōdō forced his own son, Naito, to dispose of Sarushiro, hence why Sarushiro had Naito killed. Hōinbō found Sarushiro and brought him to an orphanage; Sarushiro later saw Hōinbō kill Teikun Ō on behalf of the body double, Miwa and Bansai. They betrayed Hōinbō, but Sarushiro helped him escape; he later enacted his revenge on them, manipulating them into killing Naitō and Kagome, and killing the body double. In addition, {{he was the one who}} attacked and framed Kay to ensure that Edgeworth got involved and exposed Bansai. Sarushiro is imprisoned, and Edgeworth regains his position as a prosecutor.|$|E

25|$|Montoto went on <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of Metropolitano, {{a railway}} consortium. During Montoto's tenure in this position, the General Audit Office and ARI both issued reports {{stating that the}} {{awarding}} of this concession to him had led to deterioration in the railway service. Montoto's partnership in this and other early ventures with Sergio Tasselli, a leading K-businessman, also raised questions at the time. In 2003, La Nación said that Tasselli, whose businesses, according to the newspaper, are always under “a pall of suspicion,” was “quietly building an economic empire” that was growing “in the shadows,” and that his “associates generally do {{not come from the}} world of business but from the world of politics, such as former Montoneros leader Mario Montoto.” Instead of improving the train service provided by Metropolitano, Montoto reportedly directed Alejandra Rafuls to film train operations and to edit the film {{in such a way as}} to make it look as if customers were themselves responsible for the service problems.|$|E

For the 1872 season, Ferguson re-joined his Atlantics team, which was now a member of the National Association as well, and he would stay there through the 1874 season.

500|$|On 15 November 1988, the PLO {{proclaimed the}} {{independent}} State of Palestine.

He accepted UN Security Council Resolution 242 and Israel's right [...] "to exist in peace and security" [...] and Arafat's statements were greeted with approval by the US administration, which had long insisted on these statements as a necessary starting point for official discussions between the US and the PLO. These remarks from Arafat indicated a shift away {{from one of the}} PLO's primary aims—the destruction of Israel (as entailed in the Palestinian National Covenant)–and toward the establishment of two separate entities: an Israeli state within the 1949 armistice lines, and an Arab state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

500|$|After {{completing}} his doctorate, Sledd obtained an appointment {{as a professor}} of Greek at Methodist-affiliated Southern University (now known as Birmingham–Southern College) in Greensboro, Alabama. Several months later, on July 6, 1904, he was unanimously selected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of the University of Florida at Lake City by its board of trustees. At the time of his appointment, the University of Florida at Lake City was experiencing a controversy of its own: its administration and faculty were hopelessly fractured by personality conflicts and its unpopular president's failed attempts at improving the small school's instruction and academic standing. The university's board of trustees had removed the ineffectual president, and dismissed seven members of its small faculty. The university, such as it was, had been known as [...] "Florida Agricultural College" [...] until 1903. When Sledd arrived in Lake City, it was a school with a new name, a faculty fractured by contentious personalities, an unknown number of returning students and an uncertain future. Sledd required all previous faculty members to re-apply if they desired to keep their jobs, hired replacement instructors, most of whom had earned doctoral degrees in their respective fields (in contrast to the previous faculty), and set about devising rigorous academic standards for the school's new students. Although the university was a designated land-grant college under the federal government's Morrill Act, it received insufficient annual financial assistance from the state government, and its finances remained tenuous.|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Robinson was {{selected}} to deliver the invocation at the kickoff event of President Barack Obama's inaugural weekend. [...] Despite his extended involvement with Obama during the campaign, his selection was widely discussed {{as an effort to}} counterbalance the role of the choice of evangelical pastor Rick Warren. Media outlets noted Warren compared the legitimization of same-sex marriage to the legalization of [...] "incest, polygamy or 'an older guy marrying a child'". Warren also supported California Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in the state. However, Warren took a conciliatory tone towards Obama: [...] "I applaud his desire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of every citizen." [...] The kickoff event was held at the Lincoln Memorial two days before Obama's swearing-in. It asked [...] "the God of our many understandings" [...] for seven blessings, and to help Obama, as President, in seven ways. Neither HBO's exclusive live broadcast, nor the Presidential Inauguration Committee's blog of the event included the invocation, but the prepared text was posted in full on the website of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire, and video shot informally by attendees was posted [...] on YouTube. National Public Radio, which relied on the HBO feed that omitted it, broadcast a recording the following day with an interview of Robinson about its limited exposure; in that venue, Robinson described it as conforming to the four-fold Franciscan prayer model. According to the Washington Blade, it was the Presidential Inaugural Committee that made the decision for the prayer {{to be a part of}} the pre-show and not the show, itself, with a spokesman from that committee maintaining the prayer was dropped through an unspecified [...] "error." [...] Some gay activists maintain that this was a slight on the part of the Obama administration.|$|E
