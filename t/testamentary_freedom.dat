50|$|Within the {{circumscription}} of Alava, the Valley of Ayala {{is a land}} limiting northwards with Biscay and southwards {{with the}} Losa Valley, Burgos province. The Valley of Ayala is mentioned as “property of their inhabitants” in the Salmantinian Chronicle (9th century). Time after that valley became a Manor of the Counts of Ayala: “the Manor of Ayala, according with its 1373 Charter, is like the Manor of Biscay, as they are twinned”. In 1463 Ayala merged with the County of Alava but preserved its own authorities and courts. The 1373 Charter, enacted by the Count Fernán Pérez de Ayala, {{in a meeting with}} the five Town Mayors of the County of Saraube, was a compilation of customs and usage. It is divided into 95 chapters, 15 of which (according to Galíndez) were directly copied from the Royal Statute, whilst the rest of them comprehend the County of Ayala usage, and among which the chapter XXVIII states the utmost <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom.</b> In 1469-06-24, García II of Ayala enacted an extension of the Charter with 16 additional provisions, mainly focused against the Gang Wars, therefore not very interesting under the Civil Law point of view.|$|E
40|$|In {{terms of}} real and {{personal}} property, Canadian law grants individuals substantial <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> in {{the disposition of}} their estate. However, in regards to human remains, Ontario has upheld the common law’s longstanding “No Property Rule,” which prevents <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> in regards to one’s bodily remains. In light of changing societal notions of property and value {{with respect to the}} human body, this article argues in favour of implementing greater <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> for individuals in regards to the disposition of their body, organs, tissue, and fluids. This article reviews alternative approaches to the testamentary disposition of human remains in Quebec and British Columbia, and highlights Ontario’s enhanced <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> regarding organ donation under the Trillium Gift of Life Network Act. As a result, this article recommends increasing and securing <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> {{in order to ensure that}} all reasonable testamentary requests regarding one’s body receive the same legal status as directions regarding traditional property objects...|$|E
40|$|Family {{provision}} legislation conceived over {{a century}} ago in New Zealand sought to curb <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> which could result in estates left away from spouses and dependants who were entitled to claim newly granted state social income support. The adoption of family provision legislation in Australian jurisdictions and its subsequent statutory developments, with an overlay of judicially fostered notions of ‘moral duty’, has led to distortions in the original policy intent and application of the legislation. Growing evidence of ‘gaming’ by marginal applicants, rising costs and general uncertainty coupled with changed social circumstances has led law reform bodies to suggest certain curtailments to restore greater <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom.</b> This article examines {{the fate of the}} policy reform process to date and suggests further avenues for law reform...|$|E
40|$|<b>Testamentary</b> <b>freedom,</b> {{the guiding}} {{principle}} of American in-heritance law, grants individuals broad power {{to control the}} disposition of property at death. Most individuals, however, allow <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> to lapse because they never execute a will. Empirical research reveals that most Americans need and want a will because they cannot identify their intestate heirs, but nevertheless die intestate. The high rate of unintended intestacy is a longstanding, pernicious problem that undermines <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom,</b> disrupts the expectation of intended beneficiaries, and disproportionately affects nontraditional families and smaller estates. This Article challenges the traditional assumption that most individuals lack a will because they instinctively avoid or postpone decisions regarding death. The widespread use of nontestamentary transfers, such as pay-able-on-death accounts and life insurance, prove that Americans are willing {{to plan for the}} succession of property at death provided the process is sufficiently accessible, simple, and quick. By contrast, most lay individuals likely perceive the formality laden will-making process as obscure, complex, burdensome, and expensive. This Article proposes simplifying the testamentary process by attaching an optional form will to state individual income tax returns. This “testamentary schedule” would improve the will-making process by rendering it simple, widely accessible, easily amend-able, and less susceptible to tampering or misplacement...|$|E
40|$|The Article {{argues that}} the sanguinary nexus test, the {{dominant}} standard for determining whether an individual {{has a right to}} inherit property when another dies, has become an increasingly frustrating, and arguably arcane, legal tool in light of the diversity of family relationships extant in modern American life. The sanguinary nexus test determines child status based upon ties of “blood. ” Considering the evolving notions of family structures and advances in reproductive technologies involving cloning, surrogacy and egg/sperm donation, serious questions arise about whether the existing sanguinary nexus test can produce results consistent with the fundamental principle of <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> underlying all of estates law. Surveying a variety of parental support cases involving novel family situations, this Article deploys a normative and pragmatic critique of estates law’s current reliance upon family law principles to determine relevant family relationships. From a normative standpoint, a close examination of parental support cases reveals how reliance upon family law principles and its child-centered jurisprudence undermines the integrity of <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom.</b> Perhaps paradoxically, that potential attack on <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> has rather serious deleterious implications for effective family planning in modern society. From a pragmatic standpoint, the work demonstrates the growing impracticability of attending adequately to inheritance rights that arise from continued reliance on family law principles. To bring estates law back into step with modern family realities, this Article articulates and defends a new “unadulterated functional-based approach” to determine child status that would completely break genetic links for inheritance purposes. In the end, this Article concludes that paying greater fidelity to a functional parent-child relationship, rather than reliance upon blood relationships or family law jurisprudence, would help rehabilitate the core value of <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> in estates law...|$|E
40|$|Testamentary {{capacity}} is the defining precept for testamentary freedom; <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> {{is at the}} heart of how we balance concepts of property and the duty towards, and expectations of, family in law. The common law has allowed increasing scope for the exercise of <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> and the threshold for it is the definition of capacity. Until the creation of `statutory wills'—the ability to make a will for a person under some statutorily authorised scheme — the testator was either: the actual testator, vested with a great moral responsibility in relation to will-making; the default testator in the form of intestate schemes of distribution; or, since the early twentieth century, the court, as morally reconstituted testator, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under family provision legislation. Now there is a new character on the scene: the imagined testator, through the guise of statutory wills. This article examines statutory wills in their broader context and explores some of the challenges they pose in the theoretical landscape of will-making in the common law. 24 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{organizing}} principle of American succession law — <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> — gives decedents a nearly unrestricted right {{to dispose of}} property. After surveying the justifications for <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom,</b> I examine {{the circumstances in which}} it may be socially beneficial for courts to alter wills, trusts, and other gratuitous transfers at death: imperfect information, negative externalities, and intergenerational equity. These justifications correspond with many existing limitations on the freedom of testation. Yet, disregarding donor intent to maximize the donees’ ex post interests, an increasingly common justification for intervention, is socially undesirable. Doing so ignores important ex ante considerations, including a donor’s happiness, a donor’s incentive to work, save, and invest, and the structure and timing of a donor’s gifts. If donors believe courts may not facilitate their intent, donors may be less happy, accumulate less property, and alter gifts during life. Moreover, because the law often affects donor behavior, ignoring donative intent to benefit particular donees may harm not only the donors but also donees as a class. Thus, the living may themselves benefit if the law allows a certain degree of “dead hand” control...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion that}} a trust may fail because it serves no useful purpose or {{reflects}} merely the whim or fancy of the testator seems to fly {{in the face of}} <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> and, in particular, the testator’s right to dispose of their estate in whatever manner they choose, subject only to the court’s control over illegal or immoral conditions and the making of reasonable financial provision for their family and dependants. So how have the courts grappled with these two competing aspects of public policy...|$|E
40|$|In {{a variety}} of contexts, {{cultural}} minorities have cause to fear adjudication of their legal rights and responsibilities in a legal system dominated by majority-culture personnel (most notably including judges and jurors). This is particularly true when cultural minorities attempt to use formal legal processes {{to give effect to}} choices that are inconsistent with prevailing community norms. In such cases, the substantive merit of their legal claims is at risk of being subjugated to majoritarian values, through a process that relies on members of the majority culture to vindicate the substantive rights at issue. This phenomenon presents a cruel dilemma: cultural minorities must either forego the formal enforcement of their legal rights or trust enforcement of their rights to a culturally- biased forum. This Article proposes a solution to this Catch- 22, at least insofar as <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> is concerned. Our society is committed in principle to the ideal of <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom.</b> In practice, however, the law disfavors testamentary dispositions that deviate from the norm; it prefers gifts to the testator 2 ̆ 7 s legal spouse and close blood relations over gifts to other potential beneficiaries. Thus, for example, the matriarch who disinherits her children in favor of the guru who gave her spiritual comfort in her declining years faces a greater likelihood that her estate plan will be invalidated by a trier of fact whose sense of propriety is offended by the gift. Using the “abhorrent” testator as the focal point for an exploration of the larger problem of systemic bias, this Article considers testator-compelled arbitration as a means for overcoming the trier of fact 2 ̆ 7 s propensity to invalidate any estate plan that does not conform to majoritarian cultural norms. Part I of this Article identifies the problem and explores how the trier of fact in a will contest, wittingly or unwittingly, may use legal doctrines intended to safeguard <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> to undermine the <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> of the nonconforming testator. Part II of this Article suggests a means for alleviating this threat to the nonconforming testator 2 ̆ 7 s estate plan. Since the threat arises from distinctions between the testator 2 ̆ 7 s culture and those of the trier of fact, the proposed solution focuses on cultural understanding. Part II recommends that the nonconforming testator direct in her will that any contest concerning the will shall be adjudicated by an arbitrator appointed by the testator. Thus, the testator will be able to select a decision- maker who is familiar with and respectful of the values that informed the drafting of her estate plan. Lastly, Part III of this Article considers and rejects several objections to testator-compelled arbitration...|$|E

40|$|The {{public policy}} favoring {{testamentary}} bequests to charities {{is well established}} in the law. However, that public policy can, and does, conflict with other equally well-founded public policies. When confronted with this conflict, courts are often dismissive or even hostile towards the parties seeking to challenge a testamentary bequest to a charity. I argue that the policy favoring charitable giving {{has gone too far}} and has, in some instances, undermined other important public policies. Specifically, courts and legislators have strengthened the charitable bequest policy without giving enough consideration to other, equally important public policies. This problem is not new. History shows that similar policy conflicts have arisen periodically since late antiquity, if not earlier. The parameters of the problem, however, are somewhat new. The governing law, available technologies, and familial relationships have certainly evolved since the time of late antiquity. This article examines how the public policy favoring charitable bequests conflicts with various aspects of the equally important public policies of <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> and family protection. Part II considers the competing public policies of <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom,</b> family protection, and charitable bequests, as well as the existing legal doctrines aimed at furthering these policies. Part III examines the social and legal origins of charitable bequests and the periodic attempts to balance charitable bequests with other important policy considerations. Part IV examines the role of the non-profit sector in America today. Specifically, Part IV considers the size and scope of the nonprofit industry, the legal and economic benefits the nonprofit industry enjoys, {{and the manner in which}} nonprofits solicit charitable bequests. Part V illustrates how the current law fails to strike the appropriate balance between the competing policies, as the current law is too favorable to charities and reform is needed. Part VI concludes...|$|E

Focusing on {{the areas of}} inheritance and financial support in relation to older people, it explores how these are contrasted and linked in the two societies. In France, families are legally obliged to support their kin through obligation alimentaire, but inheritance is secured by law within the family. In England by contrast {{there is no such}} legal obligation to support older relatives; nor is there any constraint on inheritance: <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> is the legal principle. The paper discusses the significance of these differences and assesses how far they are modified by the operation of the welfare state and by embedded assumptions about family relations.

40|$|With {{the single}} {{exception}} of Louisiana, the United States provides no legislative {{protection against the}} disinheritance of minor children by their parents. This position is distinct from most {{other countries in the}} world, which require parents to provide for their children at death. Freedom of testation, a distinctly American value, is at odds with another value Americans hold dear: support and protection of one’s family. This Note argues that the balance between these two discordant values has tipped too far in the direction of <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom,</b> to the detriment of minor children. Non-custodial children are disproportionally affected by this lack of protection because they are the most likely group to be disinherited. Rather than rely on courts to inconsistently and arbitrarily protect children against disinheritance, this Note suggests that states should adopt forced heirship legislation to ensure that children are supported after the death of their parents...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, the {{emerging}} trend in trust and estate law has been a steady loosening of the limitations on <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom.</b> The 1990 Uniform Probate Code pioneered some of these developments. Construction rules are no exception. It is widely accepted that testamentary construction rules should track the owner 2 ̆ 7 s presumed intent. In this Article, I {{argue that there is}} also room, alongside these intent-furthering rules, for intent-defeating rules in inheritance law. A property owner lacks incentives to internalize the relational, familial, or economic effects of her allocation. Such rules, termed deliberative accountability rules, are therefore designed to foster accountability in estate planning. These rules burden the owner with requirements to think her decision through, and to give reasons for and face the relational consequences of her act. These rules work to counterbalance the freedom of the owner by requiring her to make an informed decision...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} legal {{challenges}} to charitable bequests by testators' {{family members have}} become more common in Australia. Many charities {{faced with the prospect}} of a disputed bequest have been reluctant to pursue the matter in the courts. A review of leading reported cases involving charitable bequests in wills reveals that the courts are vigorous in upholding proper family provision as against charitable bequests, portraying this provision as based on moral obligation. Proper provision for family and other dependants is supported by both legislation and the courts on public policy grounds. This concept is confined to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and to a lesser extent England, which are the only countries with comprehensive family provision legislation. The generational transfer of wealth by baby-boomers over the coming decades provides a scenario for increasing conflict between families and charities over bequests.

40|$|Inheritance as both {{a concept}} and a {{practice}} is of deep significance within all societies and jurisdictions. Located at the intersection between economics, family relations {{and the end of}} life, it offers a unique perspective on a variety of contemporary socio-legal debates. Yet the socio-legal phenomenon of inheritance has attracted relatively little scholastic attention. This special issue, which brings together eight papers coming from six different countries (and eight different jurisdictions) : Belgium, England and Wales, Israel, Spain (Catalonia and the Basque Country), Switzerland and the USA, demonstrates the breadth of inheritance as a field of study {{in a number of ways}} and at the same time opens up important new lines of enquiry. This international breadth serves to foreground the significance of both national and regional political culture on inheritance law. Most significant in this respect is the fact that the authors are evenly split between those commentating on civil legal systems and those on common-law systems; for traditionally the two systems have adopted highly distinct responses to the principles of <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> and forced heirship. All the articles in this collection provide insight into this fundamental distinction but at the same time demonstrate its limits in practice...|$|E
40|$|Making a {{testament}} {{seems to be}} one of the available freedoms, and most significant of the law subjects.

Freedom of compiling the testament, in the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo is guaranteed by the Law on Inheritance in Kosovo but also by the international Conventions. However, every subjective right has its limits.   Such limitation comes as a result of the care toward subjective rights of other persons, sometimes the best of the society, but the purpose of limiting such freedom in terms of inheritance, comes as result of common marital life, as a result of the care toward children and parents.

40|$|This Article {{addresses}} a disturbing statutory phenomenon of enormous importance to any artist, composer, writer, scholar, scientist or innovator. The phenomenon, which I have termed “estate-bumping,” has driven an unintended wedge between copyright law and estates law by effectively preventing authors of copyrights from disposing of their copyright interests through common estate planning mechanisms. Current copyright law imposes a unique restraint on the <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> of copyright authors, a restraint not imposed {{on any other}} type of property owner. In effect, this restraint enables unintended beneficiaries to rewrite, or “bump”, an author’s estate plan. Thus, it is copyright law – rather than the authors – that determines who ultimately has the right to profit from the author’s works. Based on a historic, philosophical and doctrinal examination of estates law and copyright law, this Article demonstrates that the phenomenon of estate-bumping remains a pressing problem. To cure this problem, the Article suggests two simple yet significant changes to reconcile the presently disconnected regimes of estates law and copyright law. Without these changes, however, the era of estate-bumping and the potential, unintentional transfers of massive amounts of wealth will begin...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{undue influence}} in the South African law of wills in light of scholarly criticism of the testamentary undue influence doctrine in the United States. The Article assesses particularly whether the so-called “undue influence paradox”, identified in American scholarship, is manifest in the South African law of wills: is testamentary undue influence’s role as protector of <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> undermined in order to realize economic family protectionism? The Article proceeds, with due recognition {{of the differences between}} the American and South African legal traditions, from American scholars’ conceptualization of the paradox and their views on other complexities associated with the doctrine, to an exposition on the conceptualization, the statutory regulation, and the judicial utilization of testamentary undue influence in South Africa. The Article determines whether or not the South African legal position conforms to some or all of the assertions made in regard to the undue influence paradox and further complexities associated with the testamentary undue influence doctrine in the American context. The Article provides a mixed jurisdiction’s response to the call for the abolition of the testamentary undue influence doctrine in recent scholarship from the United States.

40|$|How to {{regulate}} the transfer of wealth {{from one generation to}} the next has been hotly debated among politicians, legal scholars, sociologists, economists, and philosophers for centuries. Bequeathing wealth is a vital ingredient of family solidarity. But does the reproduction of social inequality through inheritance square with the principle of equal opportunity? Does democracy suffer when family wealth becomes political power? The first in-depth, comparative study of the development of inheritance law in the United States, France, and Germany, Inherited Wealth investigates longstanding political and intellectual debates over inheritance laws and explains why these laws still differ so greatly among these countries. Using a sociological perspective, Jens Beckert sheds light on the four most controversial issues in inheritance law during the past two centuries: the freedom to dispose of one's property as one wishes, the rights of family members to the wealth bequeathed, the dissolution of entails (which restrict inheritance to specific classes of heirs), and estate taxation. Beckert shows that while the United States, France, and Germany have all long defended inheritance rights based on the notion of individual property rights, they have justified limitations on inheritance rights in profoundly different ways, reflecting culturally specific ways of understanding the problems of inherited wealth.

40|$|A topical {{issue in}} the context of the general debate about the need to retain or abolish forced share in Spain is the {{question}} of whether to broaden the range of grounds for excluding a forced heir from his or her share of the estate. There is particular debate surrounding the appropriateness of adding estrangement or the lack of a family relationship to the list of grounds, with the aim of increasing <b>testamentary,</b> <b>freedom.</b> Some countries have a tendency to allow ties of affection to prevail over purely family or kinship ties in this matter, but sometimes at the cost of legal certainty, and - since such a vague ground is not necessarily more respectful with freedom of testation - despite the risk that the courts may not always achieve the justice sought by a testator who wishes to disinherit a forced heir that shows no affection for her. This paper considers the different approaches to this topic between different legal systems. The Catalan and the German ones just represent extreme examples of radical different tendencies. In Spain, recent case law has provided new arguments for thinking about what the law says, how the courts interpret, and, finally, what the society expects...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} the {{traditional}} American family has changed due to complex family structures formed through remarriages, cohabitation, and same-sex couples. Freedom of disposition is a guiding principle of inheritance law, whereby society recognizes the value in protecting one’s ability to acquire and transfer personal property at death. However, intestacy statutes are antiquated and have failed {{to keep pace with}} the rise of the modern American family, thus leaving the right to freedom of disposition uncertain and vulnerable for a large population. A will is a way of opting out of intestacy, but given that a will is frequently the subject of litigation, there is no guarantee that a court will uphold an executed will. This presents a conflict in probate law because courts are unable to honor an individual’s intent. Antemortem probate is one solution to close the gap in inheritance law, preserve the commitment to <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> of disposition embedded in inheritance law, and protect a growing population of Americans in nontraditional families who turn to wills as a means of opting out of the intestacy rules. This note examines the changing dynamics of the American family and how inheritance law could benefit from an antemortem probate procedure, and it encourages the drafters of the Uniform Probate Code to adopt an antemortem probate statute...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I review New Zealand's present {{inheritance}} laws which are characterised by: 20 disparate statutes stretching back 100 years; {{a lack of}} clear and consistent policies; a failure to adapt to fundamental changes in life expectancy, re-partnering and family groupings {{that have taken place}} over the last 40 years; inconsistent judicial decision-making; dual jurisdiction of the Family Court and High Court; mechanisms to avoid the consequences of the current legislation. Calls for urgent and fundamental reform have been met by piecemeal ad hoc changes. In contrast, reform in Australia has been systematic and carefully analysed. After considering the two common inheritance regimes around the world (the fixed rule scheme and the court-based discretionary system), I reach two fundamental conclusions: adoption of an inheritance code; recognition of the principle of <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom.</b> In addition I recommend a number of changes to New Zealand's inheritance laws, and in particular: acceptance of the primacy of the position of a surviving spouse or partner; replacement of the current family protection and testamentary promises claims with support and contribution claims; restriction of estate claims to spouses, partners and minor children; recognition of the rights of "accepted children" (stepchildren and whangai); clarification of the ability to compromise and contract out of claims; empowering one court to administer all inheritance laws; anti-avoidance measures; equating the rights of spouses, civil union partners and long term de facto partners on separation.

40|$|The {{substantial}} {{passage of}} wealth that occurs upon {{death in the}} United States each year brings into focus {{the tension between the}} belief that people should be able to dispose of their wealth as they wish and society’s interest in maintaining social stability. Nowhere is this tension more apparent than in the doctrine of undue influence. The dominant paradigm presents the undue influence doctrine as providing a double benefit of protecting freedom of testation as well as preventing overreaching by others. In this Article, the author challenges the dominant paradigm by demonstrating how the undue influence doctrine denies freedom of testation for people who deviate from judicially imposed testamentary norms - in particular, the norm that people should provide for their families. Part I looks at how case law, treatises and other authoritative sources describe undue influence as a doctrine that protects <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom.</b> Part II studies the dominant paradigm more closely by looking at the application of the doctrine to a specific undue influence case. Part III explores the paradox of the undue influence doctrine. The doctrine purports to protect freedom of testation, yet, as Kaufmann illustrates, the standards for undue influence can be met even when the will reflects the wishes of the testator. Part IV tests this new paradigm of the undue influence doctrine as a family protection doctrine by looking at how the existence or nonexistence of other provisions protecting the family against disinheritance affects the operation of the doctrine. Part V concludes by exploring whether the undue influence doctrine can be justified once it is understood in terms of family protection, rather than as a doctrine committed to preserving freedom of testation...|$|E
40|$|A {{revocable}} {{trust is}} a popular estate planning tool used to disinherit a spouse in sixteen jurisdictions. In common law jurisdictions, a surviving spouse, who is dissatisfied {{with his or her}} inheritance, has the right to receive an elective share of the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s estate regardless of the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s estate plan. However, sixteen jurisdictions have defined a dissatisfied spouse 2 ̆ 7 s rights with a fractional share of the deceased spouse 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 net probate estate, 2 ̆ 2 allowing one spouse to disinherit the other, by single-handedly transferring his or her assets to a revocable trust. To add insult to injury seven of these common law jurisdictions have recently codified trust law making it seamless for the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s creditor to be paid from revocable trust assets. The elective share is one of few limitations imposed on <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom.</b> Common law property jurisdictions have created a public policybased statute for married persons that prohibit the first-to-die spouse from disinheriting his or her surviving spouse. To avoid disinheritance, common law jurisdictions statutorily protect a surviving spouse (spouse) with an elective share. The elective share arose {{in the early nineteenth century}} as a replacement of dower and curtesy rights. At that time the nature of wealth shifting from real to personal property made dower and curtesy obsolete. The elective share protected the spouse from disinheritance by guaranteeing him or her with a fractional share of the deceased spouse 2 ̆ 7 s net probate estate, a method known as the traditional elective share. 2 ̆ 7 However, like the shift from real to personal property there has been a subsequent shift in wealth from probate to non-probate assets (like revocable trusts) making the traditional elective share equally obsolete and inadequate to protect a spouse from disinheritance...|$|E

J. 31) had significantly enhanced the award given to an estranged and “disinherited” but needy daughter (Heather Ilott) at the expense of the charities (the Blue Cross, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) who were the principal beneficiaries under her mother (Melita Jackson) ’s will, leaving her with £ 143, 000 out of the £ 486, 000 estate primarily to purchase the council house in which she and her family were living. The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the charities’ appeal, restoring Judge Million’s original £ 50, 000 order. Giving the lead judgment, Lord Hughes reasserted the centrality of <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> in English Law, emphasised the importance of the Act’s limitation to “reasonable financial provision” for maintenance for non-spouse/civil partner applicants (s. 1 (2) (b)), and held that a need for maintenance was a necessary but not sufficient condition for a successful claim. He approved previous case law in holding that maintenance could not “extend to any or every thing which it would be desirable for the claimant to have” ([14]), but was not limited to “subsistence” either ([15]). He also confirmed that the focus of the correct test under the 1975 Act is not on the behaviour of the testatrix, but opined the reasonableness of her decision may still be a significant consideration, as may the extent of any “moral claim” even if that is not a “sine qua non” ([20]) ...|$|E
40|$|Muriel’s {{mother had}} just died. She and her sister, Orit, had been {{fighting}} for years during their parents’ guardianship. Now Orit was bringing Muriel to court over who would act as personal representative of their mother’s estate. Their mother had previously executed a valid will nominating their father as personal representative, but he was undisputedly unable to serve. Their mother had chosen Muriel over Orit as the successor personal representative. As named personal representative, Muriel was statutorily preferred over Orit, however, the trial court denied Muriel’s appointment based on the sisters’ dispute. Florida’s Fourth District Court of Appeal reversed and remanded, instructing the trial court to consider {{the totality of the}} circumstances. The court reiterated the general rule from Pontrello v. Estate of Kepler that a trial court may deny the appointment of a testator’s nominated personal representative only in exceptional circumstances, and a dispute, standing alone, does not give rise to such discretion. At this point, the Schleider court would have satisfactorily disposed of the sisters’ case. However, the court proceeded, redefining the standard to afford courts broader discretion to deny appointment of a testator’s nominated personal representative. Schleider held that if a dispute exists that would result in unnecessary litigation and impede the administration of the estate, courts may consider (1) factors used in previous intestate succession cases, particularly from In re Estate of Snyder, and (2) any cause for the removal of a personal representative. This holding sharply conflicted with Pontrello, which, by distinguishing an intestate appointment from a testate appointment and the appointment statutes from the removal statute, specifically prohibited courts from considering these factors when denying the appointment of a testator’s nominated personal representative. Schleider’s holding generates drastically inconsistent outcomes for litigants depending on the jurisdiction in which the will is probated. For example, if the court found that the sisterly dispute would result in unnecessary litigation and impede the administration of the estate, a court following Schleider’s holding {{would be more likely to}} deny Muriel’s appointment. By contrast, a court following Pontrello would be more likely to uphold her appointment. This conflict has gradually evolved into a split within the Florida district courts of appeal. As recently as 2007, Schleider has been cited and followed in the Fourth and Fifth District Courts of Appeal and recognized in the U. S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. As recently as 2008, the First and Second District Courts of Appeal have cited and followed Pontrello. Schleider’s additional factors afford courts undue discretion when denying appointment of a testator’s nominated personal representative. By adopting these additional factors, Schleider disregarded two important aspects of Pontrello’s holding: (1) the greater weight afforded to a testator’s nominated personal representative; and (2) the distinction between the appointment and removal statutes. This Comment discusses these two issues and argues that Schleider incorrectly swept them aside. Schleider’s holding weakens property succession laws’ longstanding deference to <b>testamentary</b> <b>freedom</b> and substitutes judicial control instead. Experts agree that denying the appointment of a testator’s nominated personal representative is not a trivial matter. Courts should afford the utmost deference to a testator’s nomination...|$|E
