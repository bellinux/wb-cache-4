5|$|The two Crex {{species have}} huge {{breeding}} ranges and large populations and are classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. The corn crake was formerly classified as near-threatened because of serious declines in western Europe, but improved monitoring shows that numbers have remained stable further east in Russia and Kazakhstan. In {{much of the}} western half of the corn crake's breeding range, there have been long-term declines <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> continue. The main cause of the decline {{is the loss of}} nests and chicks from early mowing. Haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers. Loss of habitat is the other major threat to the corn crake. Drained and fertilised silage fields are less suitable for breeding than traditional hay meadows. In western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable land has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming has led to the abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area.|$|E

5|$|Until 2010, {{despite a}} {{breeding}} range estimated at , the corn crake {{was classified as}} near threatened on the IUCN Red List because of serious declines in Europe, but improved monitoring in Russia indicates that anticipated losses there have not occurred and numbers have remained stable or possibly increased. It is therefore now classed as least concern, since the major populations in Russia and Kazakhstan {{are not expected to}} change much in the short term. There are an estimated 1.3–2.0 million breeding pairs in Europe, three-quarters of which are in European Russia, and a further 515,000–1,240,000 pairs in Asiatic Russia; the total Eurasian population has been estimated at between 5.45 and 9.72 million individuals. In much of the western half of its range, there have been long-term declines <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> continue, although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries, including a five-fold increase in Finland, and a doubling in the UK. In the Netherlands, there were 33 breeding territories in 1996, but this number had increased to at least 500 by 1998.|$|E
5|$|In much of {{the western}} half of the corn crake's {{breeding}} range, there have been long-term declines <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> continue, although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries, including substantial increases in the small populations in Finland, the UK and the Netherlands. The breeding population had begun to decline in the 19th century, but the process gained pace after World War II. The main cause of the steep declines in much of Europe {{is the loss of}} nests and chicks from early mowing. Haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers, at first horse-drawn and later pulled by tractors. Mechanisation also means that large areas can be cut quickly, leaving the crake with no alternative sites to raise either a first brood if suitable habitat has gone, or a replacement brood if the first nest is destroyed. The pattern of mowing, typically in a circular pattern from the outside of a field to its centre, gives little chance of escape for the chicks, which are also exposed to potential animal predators. Adults can often escape the mowers, although some incubating females sit tight on the nest, with fatal results.|$|E

25|$|A script has two parts: {{slots and}} requirements. In the life script, slots are {{culturally}} important transitional events <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> occur within a circumscribed age span {{in the life}} course of an individual; and, the requirement is the prescribed appropriate age for the culturally expected event that leads to causal sequencing, {{in a series of}} succeeding events.|$|E
25|$|Often, {{through-hole}} and surface-mount construction must {{be combined}} {{in a single}} assembly because some required components are available only in surface-mount packages, while others are available only in through-hole packages. Another reason to use both methods is that through-hole mounting can provide needed strength for components likely to endure physical stress, while components <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> go untouched will take up less space using surface-mount techniques.|$|E

25|$|Outside of the reactor, the ACR-1000 has {{a number}} of design changes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> {{dramatically}} lower capital and operational costs. Primary among these changes is the design lifetime of 60 years, which dramatically lowers the price of the electricity generated over the lifetime of the plant. The design also has an expected capacity factor of 90%. Higher pressure steam generators and turbines improve efficiency downstream of the reactor.|$|E
25|$|Some {{problems}} <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be {{an issue}} in this century, such as fresh water shortages, can alternatively be regarded as problems of energy supply. For example, in desalination stations, seawater can be purified through distillation or reverse osmosis. Nonetheless, these processes are energy intensive. Even if the first fusion stations are not competitive with alternative sources, fusion could still become competitive if large-scale desalination requires more power than the alternatives are able to provide.|$|E
25|$|Incentive {{theory in}} {{psychology}} treats motivation {{and behavior of}} the individual as they are influenced by beliefs, such as engaging in activities <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be profitable. Incentive theory is promoted by behavioral psychologists, such as B.F. Skinner. Incentive theory is especially supported by Skinner in his philosophy of Radical behaviorism, meaning that a person's actions always have social ramifications: and if actions are positively received {{people are more likely}} to act in this manner, or if negatively received people are less likely to act in this manner.|$|E

25|$|Bipartite graphs are {{extensively}} used {{in modern}} coding theory, especially to decode codewords {{received from the}} channel. Factor graphs and Tanner graphs are examples of this. A Tanner graph is a bipartite graph in which the vertices {{on one side of}} the bipartition represent digits of a codeword, and the vertices on the other side represent combinations of digits <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> sum to zero in a codeword without errors. A factor graph is a closely related belief network used for probabilistic decoding of LDPC and turbo codes.|$|E
25|$|The normal {{distribution}} is useful {{because of the}} central limit theorem. In its most general form, under some conditions (which include finite variance), it states that averages of samples of observations of random variables independently drawn from independent distributions converge in distribution to the normal, that is, become normally distributed {{when the number of}} observations is sufficiently large. Physical quantities <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be the sum of many independent processes (such as measurement errors) often have distributions that are nearly normal. Moreover, many results and methods (such as propagation of uncertainty and least squares parameter fitting) can be derived analytically in explicit form when the relevant variables are normally distributed.|$|E
25|$|In polar regions <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> {{experience}} {{among the}} most rapid impact from climate warming, springtails have shown contrasting responses to warming in experimental warming studies. There are negative, positive and neutral responses reported. Neutral responses to experimental warming have also been reported in studies of non-polar regions. The importance of soil moisture has been demonstrated in experiments using infrared heating in an alpine meadow, which had {{a negative effect on}} mesofauna biomass and diversity in drier parts and a positive effect in moist sub-areas. Furthermore, a study with 20 years of experimental warming in three contrasting plant communities found that small scale heterogeneity may buffer springtails to potential climate warming.|$|E
