25|$|Until {{the mid-19th}} century, {{commercial}} banks were allowed <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> their own banknotes, and notes issued by provincial banking companies were commonly in circulation. The Bank Charter Act 1844 {{began the process}} of restricting note <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> the Bank; new banks were prohibited from issuing their own banknotes and existing note-issuing banks were not permitted <b>to</b> expand their <b>issue.</b> As provincial banking companies merged to form larger banks, they lost their right <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> notes, and the English private banknote eventually disappeared, leaving the Bank with a monopoly of note issue in England and Wales. The last private bank <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> its own banknotes in England and Wales was Fox, Fowler and Company in 1921. However, {{the limitations of the}} 1844 Act only affected banks in England and Wales, and today three commercial banks in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland continue <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> their own banknotes, regulated by the Bank.|$|R

50|$|On June 4, 1963, Kennedy signed Public Law 88-36, which {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the end for even the $1 silver certificate. The law authorized the Federal Reserve <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> $1 and $2 bills, and revoked the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, which authorized the Secretary of the Treasury <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> silver certificates (by now limited to the $1 denomination). Because it would be several months before the new $1 Federal Reserve Notes could enter circulation in quantity, there was a need <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> silver certificates in the interim. Because the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 granted the right <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> silver certificates <b>to</b> the president, Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110 to delegate that authority to the Treasury Secretary during the transition.|$|R
