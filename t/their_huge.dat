5|$|Balaenids rely on <b>their</b> <b>huge</b> heads, {{as opposed}} to the rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E

25|$|Pre-adaptation {{may occur}} because a natural {{population}} carries a huge quantity of genetic variability. In diploid eukaryotes, {{this is a}} consequence of the system of sexual reproduction, where mutant alleles get partially shielded, for example, by the selective advantage of heterozygotes. Microorganisms, with <b>their</b> <b>huge</b> populations, also carry a great deal of genetic variability.|$|E
25|$|Eusocial {{behavior}} {{has been discovered}} in the genus Synalpheus. The species Synalpheus regalis lives inside sponges in colonies that can number over 300 members. All of them are the offspring of a single large female, the queen, and possibly a single male. The offspring are divided into workers who care for the young and predominantly male soldiers who protect the colony with <b>their</b> <b>huge</b> claws.|$|E
25|$|Frowth giants are {{extremely}} large, standing roughly twenty {{feet tall and}} eight feet wide at the shoulders. They are covered in a matted yellow fur, and their faces are dominated by a long snout. <b>Their</b> <b>huge</b> size and strength makes them useful in labor and in combat. Frowth giants sometimes wear armor, and they carry huge iron-bound staves as weapons. With sharp teeth, they will kill or eat carrion if it is available. They have a limited ability for speech.|$|E

25|$|The once mighty American Printing Company finally {{closed for}} good in 1934. In 1937, <b>their</b> <b>huge</b> plant {{waterfront}} on Water Street {{was acquired by}} the Firestone Tire & Rubber Company and soon employed 2,600 people. In October 1941, {{just a few weeks}} before the attack on Pearl Harbor, a huge fire broke out in the old 1860s' main building of the print works. The fire was a major setback to the U.S. war effort, as $15 million in raw rubber (30,000lbs.) was lost in the inferno.|$|E
25|$|That {{same year}} the USAF Experimental Flight Test Pilot School became the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School, as the Air Force tried {{to enter into}} the {{research}} of space. Collins applied for a new course offered into the basics of spaceflight (other students included Charles Bassett, Edward Givens and Joe Engle). Along with classwork they also flew up to about 90,000 feet in F-104 Starfighters. As they passed through the top of <b>their</b> <b>huge</b> arc, they would experience a brief period of weightlessness. Finishing this course he returned to fighter ops in May 1963.|$|E

To the west of this vast area was Belmont's Francis I Renaissance-style Grand Hall and foyer which exited onto Ledge Road. The monumental Gothic rooms with <b>their</b> <b>huge</b> stained-glass windows were emblazoned with the Belmont coat of arms. The room's original damask, blood red in colour, has long since been replaced with the same fabric in gold.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, resentment {{amongst the}} {{population}} of Italy against the foreigner Avitus grew. The Gallo-Roman Emperor had given to {{other members of the}} Gallo-Roman aristocracy many key offices of the public administration usually filled by Romans. Furthermore, {{the population of}} Rome, devastated by the sack of Rome, suffered from food shortages due to the Vandal control of the naval routes, aggravated by the requirements of the foreign troops that had arrived with Avitus. The imperial treasury was almost empty and, after disbanding his Visigoth guard because of popular pressure, Avitus was obliged to pay <b>their</b> <b>huge</b> wages by melting down and selling the bronze of some statues.|$|E
25|$|In 1294, Ala-ud-din Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate raided Devagiri. Khalji {{restored}} it to Ramachandra {{in return}} for his promise of payment of a high ransom and an annual tribute. However, this was not paid and the Seuna kingdom's arrears to Khalji kept mounting. In 1307, Khalji sent an army commanded by Malik Kafur, accompanied by Khwaja Haji, to Devagiri. The Muslim governors of Malwa and Gujarat were ordered to help Malik Kafur. <b>Their</b> <b>huge</b> army conquered the weakened and defeated forces of Devagiri almost without a battle. Ramachandra was taken to Delhi. Khalji reinstated Ramachandra as governor {{in return for}} a promise to help him subdue the Hindu kingdoms in South India. In 1310, Malik Kafur mounted an assault on the Kakatiya kingdom from Devagiri.|$|E
25|$|Miller and Lux {{were not}} any newer to the San Joaquin Valley {{than had been}} Haggin, but were the driving {{influence}} on valley agribusiness {{until well into the}} early 20th century. The corporation had begun acquiring land in the valley in 1858, eventually holding sway over an enormous swath reaching from the Kern River in the south to the Chowchilla River in the north. Much of the land that Miller and Lux acquired was swamp and marsh, which was considered virtually worthless. However, with <b>their</b> <b>huge</b> capital, they could afford to drain thousands of acres of it, beginning an enormous environmental change that eventually resulted in the loss of over 95 percent of the wetlands adjoining the San Joaquin River and Tulare Basin.|$|E

6000|$|The Lepidodendrons, again, {{are without}} doubt the splendid old representatives {{of a family}} now dwindled down to such {{creeping}} things as our club-mosses, or Lycopodiums. Now it is a certain fact, which can be proved by the microscope, that a very great part of the best coal is actually made up of millions of the minute seeds of club- mosses, such as grow--a few of them, and those very small--on our moors; a proof, surely, {{not only of the}} vast amount of the vegetation in the coal-making age, but also of the vast time during which it lasted. The Lepidodendra may have been fifty or sixty feet high. [...] There is not a Lycopodium in the world now, I believe, five feet high. But the club-mosses are now, in these islands and elsewhere, lovers of wet and peaty soils, and so may <b>their</b> <b>huger</b> prototypes have been, in the old forests of the coal.|$|R

25|$|As a boy, {{inspired}} by his father's accounts of family history during the American Revolution and the War of 1812, Seth longed to join the Navy. Before going off to join he bid farewell to his mother, who was apprehensive of his joining the navy, and to his proud father, who whole heartily supported Seth's aspirations, and set off for New York, arriving there in January 1842. Here Phelps saw {{for the first time}} many tall clipper ships and war ships and was impressed with <b>their</b> <b>huge</b> masts and banners filling the skyline. He was assigned to the USS Independence, launched in 1814, a Ship of the line, 190 feet long with 74 guns. At the time of Phelps' commission the vessel had been converted to a 60 gun frigate.|$|E
25|$|Henry John Temple {{was born}} in his family's Westminster house to the Irish branch of the Temple family on 20 October 1784. Henry was to become The 3rd Viscount Palmerston upon his father's death in 1802. His family derived their title from the Peerage of Ireland, {{although}} the 3rd Viscount would almost never visit Ireland. His father was The 2nd Viscount Palmerston (1739–1802), an Anglo-Irish peer, {{and his mother was}} Mary (1752–1805), a daughter of Benjamin Mee, a London merchant. From 1792 to 1794, the young future Lord Palmerston accompanied his family on a long Continental tour. Whilst in Italy Palmerston acquired an Italian tutor, who taught him to speak and write fluent Italian. The family rarely visited <b>their</b> <b>huge</b> country estate in the north of County Sligo in the West of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Bishops held {{considerable}} secular responsibilities. As tenants-in-chief of the crown, {{they were}} responsible for providing a quota of armed knights for the king's army. Although they weren't expected be involved in actual combat, several bishops became active military leaders; an example is Thurstan, Archbishop of York, who mustered the army that defeated the Scots at the Battle of the Standard in 1138. Bishops were also responsible for administering <b>their</b> <b>huge</b> estates and presiding in the courts that dealt with civil disputes within them. They were also required to attend royal councils, and {{with the development of}} the Parliament of England in the 13th century, the two archbishops and nineteen bishops were required to take their seats in the House of Lords, along with the abbots and priors of the largest religious houses; collectively, they were known as the Lords Spiritual.|$|E
