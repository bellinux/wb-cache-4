50|$|In 1990 <b>the</b> <b>Harps</b> reached <b>the</b> Tyrone Intermediate Football Championship final but a {{severely}} weakened team proved {{no match for}} an Ardboe side who were Senior champions 3 years previously. Despite a good league showing that year as well, <b>the</b> <b>Harps</b> spent <b>the</b> next six years languishing in the lower regions of Intermediate football before being relegated to Junior football again in 1997. <b>The</b> <b>Harps</b> second spell in Junior Football only lasted two seasons as Intermediate status was regained for the year 2000 {{as a result of}} league restructuring. Three seasons of Intermediate football followed for <b>the</b> <b>Harps</b> before relegation back to Junior football again in 2002. Even though the Senior team was struggling there was still hope for <b>the</b> <b>Harps</b> as a strong youth policy was beginning to come to fruition. The U-16's won the league and championship double in 2001 while Minor leagues were won in 2002 and 2003. The majority of these players are now part of <b>the</b> <b>Harps</b> senior squad and they have now transferred this youth success onto the senior stage by winning Tyrone and Ulster Junior Club Football Championships in 2004 and in 2005 reaching an All-Ireland Junior Club Football Championship Final. 2005 was also a big year off the field for <b>the</b> <b>Harps</b> as a new pavilion was built at Mullaghmoyle to replace the existing pavilion which had been built in 1974. 2006 was the year when <b>the</b> <b>Harps</b> finally gained promotion back to Senior Championship Football after a period of 26 years, and it was fitting that <b>the</b> <b>Harps</b> were back in senior ranks in 2007, 50 years after <b>the</b> present <b>Harps</b> club was reformed.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{influences}} of Greece and Rome, most musical instruments in Europe during the Middles Ages came from Asia. The lyre is the only musical instrument {{that may have been}} invented in Europe until this period. Stringed instruments were prominent in Middle Age Europe. The central and northern regions used mainly lutes, stringed instruments with necks, while the southern region used lyres, which featured a two-armed body and a crossbar. Various harps served Central and Northern Europe as far north as Ireland, where <b>the</b> <b>harp</b> eventually became a national symbol. Lyres propagated through the same areas, as far east as Estonia.|$|E

5|$|Heralds {{could have}} {{attributed}} to Jesus <b>the</b> <b>harp</b> for arms inherited as {{a descendant of}} David. Nevertheless, the cross was regarded as Christ's emblem, {{and it was so}} used by the Crusaders. Sometimes the arms of Christ feature a Paschal lamb as the principal charge. By the 13th century, however, numerous indulgences had brought increased veneration for the instruments of the Passion. These instruments were described in heraldic terms and treated as personal to Christ much as a coat of arms (Dennys, 96). An early example in a seal from c. 1240 includes the Cross, nails, lance, crown of thorns, sponge and whips.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, she {{enrolled}} at the University of Chicago, where she studied music and languages, intending to become an orchestral musician. She studied <b>the</b> <b>harp</b> under Walfried Singer, the Chicago Symphony's harpist. She left after three years before graduating, lonely and bitterly disillusioned. In 1918, she married Albert Dilling, an engineer studying law who attended the same Episcopalian church as Elizabeth. The couple were well off financially, thanks to Elizabeth's inherited money and Albert's job as chief engineer for the Chicago Sewerage District. They lived in Wilmette, a Chicago suburb, and had two children, Kirkpatrick in 1920, and Elizabeth Jane in 1925.|$|E

5|$|Forty {{tanks of}} the 1st Brigade {{were to be}} used in the attack on the Third Army front, eight with XVIII Corps and sixteen each in VII Corps and VI Corps. When the blue line had been reached, four of the VII Corps tanks were to join VI Corps for its attack on the brown line. The black line (first objective) was not to be {{attacked}} by tanks, which were to begin the drive to the front line at zero-hour and rendezvous with infantry at the black line two hours later. The tanks were reserved for the most difficult objectives beyond the black line in groups of up to ten vehicles. Four tanks were to attack Neuville Vitasse, four against Telegraph Hill, four against <b>The</b> <b>Harp</b> and another four against Tilloy lez Mofflaines and two were to drive down the slope from Roclincourt west of Bois de la Maison Blanche. Once the blue line had fallen, the tanks still running were to drive to rally points.|$|E
5|$|On land, {{pinnipeds}} are near-sighted in dim light. This {{is reduced}} in bright light, as the retracted pupil reduces the lens and cornea's ability to bend light. They {{also have a}} well-developed tapetum lucidum, a reflecting layer that increases sensitivity by reflecting light back through the rods. This helps them see in low-light conditions. Ice-living seals like <b>the</b> <b>harp</b> seal have corneas that can tolerate high levels of ultraviolet radiation typical of bright, snowy environments. As such, they do not suffer snow blindness. Pinnipeds appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones. Flexible eye movement has been documented in seals. The extraocular muscles of the walrus are well developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both frontal and dorsal directions. Seals release large amounts of mucus to protect their eyes. The corneal epithelium is keratinized and the sclera is thick enough to withstand the pressures of diving. As in many mammals and birds, pinnipeds possess nictitating membranes.|$|E

5|$|Other seals, {{like the}} walrus and most phocids, breed on ice with {{copulation}} usually {{taking place in}} the water (a few land-breeding species also mate in water). Females of these species tend to aggregate less. In addition, since ice is less stable than solid land, breeding sites change location each year, and males are unable to predict where females will stay during the breeding season. Hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, where females form dense aggregations perhaps due to their patchy food sources. Pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on pack ice. Some of these species are serially monogamous, including <b>the</b> <b>harp</b> seal, crabeater seal and hooded seal. Seals that breed on ice tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly longer than males. Walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.|$|E
5|$|Bards, {{who acted}} as musicians, {{but also as}} poets, story tellers, historians, genealogists and lawyers, relying on an oral {{tradition}} that stretched back generations, were found in Scotland as well as Wales and Ireland. Often accompanying themselves on <b>the</b> <b>harp,</b> {{they can also be}} seen in records of the Scottish courts throughout the medieval period. Scottish church music from the later Middle Ages was increasingly influenced by continental developments, with figures like 13th-century musical theorist Simon Tailler studying in Paris before returning to Scotland, where he introduced several reforms in church music. Scottish collections of music like the 13th-century 'Wolfenbüttel 677', which is associated with St Andrews, contain mostly French compositions, but with some distinctive local styles. The captivity of James I in England from 1406 to 1423, where he earned a reputation as a poet and composer, may have led him to take English and continental styles and musicians back to the Scottish court on his release. In the late 15th century a series of Scottish musicians trained in the Netherlands before returning home, including John Broune, Thomas Inglis and John Fety, the last of whom became master of the song school in Aberdeen and then Edinburgh, introducing the new five-fingered organ playing technique. In 1501 James IV refounded the Chapel Royal within Stirling Castle, with a new and enlarged choir, and it became the focus of Scottish liturgical music. Burgundian and English influences were probably reinforced when Henry VII's daughter Margaret Tudor married James IV in 1503.|$|E
