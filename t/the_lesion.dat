5|$|Lung lesions, once identified, {{are usually}} treated to prevent episodes of {{bleeding}} {{and more importantly}} embolism to the brain. This is particularly done in lesions with a feeding blood vessel of 3mm or larger, as {{these are the most}} likely to cause long-term complications unless treated. The most effective current therapy is embolization with detachable metal coils. The procedure involves puncture of a large vein (usually under a general anesthetic), followed by advancing of a catheter through the right ventricle and into the pulmonary artery, after which radiocontrast is injected to visualize the AVMs (pulmonary angiography). Once <b>the</b> <b>lesion</b> has been identified, coils are deployed that obstruct the blood flow and allow <b>the</b> <b>lesion</b> to regress. In experienced hands, the procedure tends to be very effective and with limited side effects, but lesions may recur and further attempts may be required. CTA scans are repeated to monitor for recurrence. Surgical excision has now essentially been abandoned due to the success of embolotherapy.|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since it}} was {{demonstrated}} that pathological alterations of the hearts (l- 13), arteries(2 - 18), and kidneys(14, 19 - 22) can result from administration of foreign serum proteins in animals, interest in these lesions has resulted from their apparent resemblance to certain diseases in man whose cause is still unknown. <b>The</b> <b>lesions</b> of <b>the</b> heart have been likened by most investigators to <b>the</b> <b>lesions</b> occurring in <b>the</b> hearts of human cases of rheumatic fever(2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,ll, 12, 21); <b>the</b> <b>lesions</b> of <b>the</b> arteries to <b>the</b> <b>lesions</b> occurring in human periarteritis nodosa(2 - 18, 21) {{and those of the}} kidney to human glomerulonephritis(14, 19 - 22). Whereas the opinion regarding the comparison of <b>the</b> <b>lesions</b> of <b>the</b> arteries and kidneys to the human diseases has been almost unanimous, the idea has been expressed that <b>the</b> <b>lesions</b> of <b>the</b> heart cannot be justifiably compared to <b>the</b> <b>lesions</b> of human rheumatic fever(13, 23 - 25). Since our interest in <b>the</b> experimental <b>lesions</b> stems from interest in their relationship to <b>the</b> <b>lesions</b> of <b>the</b> human diseases, it is pertinent to begin with a consideration of the validity of the comparison of the experimentally-induced with the spontaneously occurring diseases...|$|R
40|$|Periodontitis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease which gradually destroys the supporting tissues of the teeth, leading to tooth loss in adults. <b>The</b> <b>lesions</b> {{are characterized by}} a persistence of inflammatory cells in gingival and periodontal connective tissues. To understand what mechanisms {{are involved in the}} establishment of chronic lesions, we hypothesized that infiltrating lymphocytes might be resistant to apoptosis. However, both Bcl- 2 and Bcl-xL were weakly detected in lymphocytes from <b>the</b> <b>lesions,</b> compared with those from peripheral blood, suggesting that these cells are susceptible to apoptosis. Nevertheless, very few apoptotic cells were observed in tissue sections from <b>the</b> <b>lesions.</b> Lymphocytes from <b>the</b> <b>lesions</b> expressed mRNA encoding Fas, whereas Fas-ligand mRNA was very weakly expressed in lymphocytes from <b>the</b> <b>lesions</b> and in periodontal tissues. Since the results indicated that lymphocytes in <b>the</b> <b>lesions</b> might be susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis but lack the death signal, we next investigated if these lymphocytes actually undergo apoptosis by the addition of anti-Fas antibodies in vitro. Fas-positive lymphocytes from <b>the</b> <b>lesions</b> underwent apoptosis by these antibodies, but Fas-negative lymphocytes and Fas-positive peripheral lymphocytes did not undergo apoptosis by these antibodies. These results indicate that lymphocytes in <b>the</b> <b>lesions</b> are susceptible to activation-induced cell death and are induced to die by apoptosis after the addition of exogenous Fas ligand...|$|R
50|$|In young birds, <b>the</b> early <b>lesions</b> {{appear as}} small white to {{yellowish}} {{areas in the}} mouth cavity, especially the soft palate. <b>The</b> <b>lesions</b> consist of inflammation and ulceration of the mucosal surface. <b>The</b> <b>lesions</b> increase in size and number and extend to the esophagus, crop and proventriculus. <b>The</b> <b>lesions</b> may develop into large, firm necrotic masses that may block the lumen. Occasionally, the disease may spread by penetrating the underlying tissues to involve the liver and other organs.|$|R
5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>lesion</b> is localized, it is {{generally}} curable. However, long-term survival for children with advanced disease older than 18 months of age is poor despite aggressive multimodal therapy (intensive chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, stem cell transplant, differentiation agent isotretinoin also called 13-cis-retinoic acid, and frequently immunotherapy with anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody therapy).|$|E
5|$|A bypass {{platform}} is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At {{a site of}} lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass <b>the</b> <b>lesion</b> and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension {{can be carried out}} by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, {{as in the case of}} Pol η, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; Pol ζ. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix <b>the</b> <b>lesion,</b> then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} occur with treatment; for example a {{granuloma}} can form at the suture site. Also, the sutured wound can tear again, as occurs {{when there is}} excessive pressure in the airways from ventilation. However, {{for people who do}} receive surgery soon after the injury to repair <b>the</b> <b>lesion,</b> outcome is usually good; the long-term outcome is good for over 90% of people who have TBI surgically repaired early in treatment. Even when surgery is performed years after the injury, the outlook is good, with low rates of death and disability and good chances of preserving lung function.|$|E
50|$|Fungal {{infection}} manifests as greenish {{white spots}} a few millimeters wide on the undersides of a plant's leaves.

40|$|By {{the use of}} a {{perfusion}} {{technique for}} identifying blood vessels, it was found that amyloid lesions in mice have a close relation to the underlying microcirculation. <b>The</b> earliest <b>lesions</b> develop about arteriolar capillaries. With the onset of <b>the</b> <b>lesions,</b> circulation of plasma not only continues through the affected vessels but also extends into the entire volume of <b>the</b> surrounding <b>lesions.</b> Progression of <b>the</b> <b>lesions</b> follows <b>the</b> underlying microcirculation, and there is a continuing presence of circulating proteins. Other observations, from tracer studies using labeled plasma proteins and studies of unfixed, frozen, tissue sections following saline extraction, indicate that much of <b>the</b> early amyloid <b>lesions</b> in these animals is circulating plasma. It would appear that the onset and site of formation of <b>the</b> <b>lesions</b> is determined by arteriolar capillary injury rather than by polymorphism of SAA proteins.

5|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) scans and Technetium-99m bone scans {{are also}} sometimes {{used to monitor}} the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans can show the exact location and extent of <b>the</b> <b>lesion.</b> Technetium bone scans can detect regional blood flow {{and the amount of}} osseous uptake.

5|$|Damage to {{the optic}} nerve (II) affects {{specific}} aspects of vision that depend on the location of <b>the</b> <b>lesion.</b> A person {{may not be able}} to see objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining the visual field, or by examining the retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along the visual pathways.|$|E
5|$|Further {{significant}} developments did {{not come}} until the Renaissance. Vesalius discussed the cerebellum briefly, and the anatomy was described more thoroughly by Thomas Willis in 1664. More anatomical work was done during the 18th century, {{but it was not}} until early in the 19th century that the first insights into the function of the cerebellum were obtained. Luigi Rolando in 1809 established the key finding that damage to the cerebellum results in motor disturbances. Jean Pierre Flourens in the first half of the 19th century carried out detailed experimental work, which revealed that animals with cerebellar damage can still move, but with a loss of coordination (strange movements, awkward gait, and muscular weakness), and that recovery after <b>the</b> <b>lesion</b> can be nearly complete unless <b>the</b> <b>lesion</b> is very extensive. By the beginning of the 20th century, it was widely accepted that the primary function of the cerebellum relates to motor control; the first half of the 20th century produced several detailed descriptions of the clinical symptoms associated with cerebellar disease in humans.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the course}} of 60 {{consecutive}} multiple sclerosis patients (relapsing-remitting (RR), relapsing-progressive (RP), primary-progressive (PP)) was compared with the number and mean size of <b>the</b> <b>lesions</b> {{as well as the}} total load of <b>the</b> <b>lesions</b> as shown on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Significant differences were found between RR and RP patients in total load and number of lesions.

5|$|Physical {{examination}} typically reveals {{fluid in}} the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as <b>the</b> <b>lesion</b> progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture {{has a similar}} presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis. Although {{there is no significant}} pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.|$|E
5|$|Prognosis differs {{depending}} on the severity and location of <b>the</b> <b>lesion,</b> and access to immediate, specialised acute management. Subarachnoid hemorrhage approximately doubles mortality. Subdural hematoma is associated with worse outcome and increased mortality, while people with epidural hematoma {{are expected to have}} a good outcome if they receive surgery quickly. Diffuse axonal injury may be associated with coma when severe, and poor outcome. Following the acute stage, prognosis is strongly influenced by the patient's involvement in activity that promote recovery, which for most patients requires access to a specialised, intensive rehabilitation service. The Functional Independence Measure is a way to track progress and degree of independence throughout rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|Surgery (by craniotomy, open brain surgery) may {{be offered}} {{based on the}} risks of {{treatment}} {{as determined by the}} Spetzler–Martin scale (grade I-V); this score is higher in larger lesions that are close to important brain structures and have deep venous drainage. High grade lesions (IV and V) have an unacceptably high risk and surgery is not typically offered in those cases. Radiosurgery (using targeted radiation therapy such as by a gamma knife) may be used if <b>the</b> <b>lesion</b> is small but close to vital structures. Finally, embolization may be used on small lesions that have only a single feeding vessel.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} {{surgical}} versus non-surgical treatments for osteochondritis dissecans is controversial. Consequently, {{the type and}} extent of surgery necessary varies based on patient age, severity of <b>the</b> <b>lesion,</b> and personal bias of the treating surgeon—entailing an exhaustive list of suggested treatments. A variety of surgical options exist {{for the treatment of}} persistently symptomatic, intact, partially detached, and completely detached OCD lesions. Post-surgery reparative cartilage is inferior to healthy hyaline cartilage in glycosaminoglycan concentration, histological, and immunohistochemical appearance. As a result, surgery is often avoided if non-operative treatment is viable.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} after different treatments varies and {{is based}} on several factors which include the age of the patient, the affected joint, the stage of <b>the</b> <b>lesion</b> and, most importantly, the state of the growth plate. It follows that the two main forms of osteochondritis dissecans are defined by skeletal maturity. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in open growth plates, usually affecting {{children between the ages of}} 5 and 15 years. The adult form commonly occurs between ages 16 to 50, although it is unclear whether these adults developed the disease after skeletal maturity or were undiagnosed as children.|$|E
5|$|Even {{people with}} {{complete}} SCI, in whom {{the spinal cord}} cannot transmit any messages past the level of <b>the</b> <b>lesion,</b> can achieve orgasm.

Men with complete SCI report sexual sensations at the time of ejaculation, accompanied by physical signs normally found at orgasm, such as increased blood pressure. Women can experience orgasm with vibration to the cervix regardless of level or completeness of injury; the sensation is the same as uninjured women experience.|$|E

5|$|In Escherichia coli, SOS {{boxes are}} 20-nucleotide long {{sequences}} near promoters with palindromic structure {{and a high}} degree of sequence conservation. In other classes and phyla, the sequence of SOS boxes varies considerably, with different length and composition, but it is always highly conserved and one of the strongest short signals in the genome. The high information content of SOS boxes permits differential binding of LexA to different promoters and allows for timing of the SOS response. <b>The</b> <b>lesion</b> repair genes are induced at the beginning of SOS response. The error-prone translesion polymerases, for example, UmuCD'2 (also called DNA polymerase V), are induced later on as a last resort. Once the DNA damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination, the amount of single-stranded DNA in cells is decreased, lowering the amounts of RecA filaments decreases cleavage activity of LexA homodimer, which then binds to the SOS boxes near promoters and restores normal gene expression.|$|E
5|$|Once {{candidates}} for treatment have been screened, treatment proceeds {{according to the}} lesion's location. For example, those with OCD of the knee are immobilized for {{four to six weeks}} or even up to six months in extension to remove shear stress from the involved area; however, they are permitted to walk with weight bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they reveal that <b>the</b> <b>lesion</b> has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted. Those demonstrating healing by increased radiodensity in the subchondral region, or those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates to repeat the above described three-month protocol until healing is noted.|$|E
25|$|The terms {{mass and}} nodule {{are often used}} synonymously with tumor.
