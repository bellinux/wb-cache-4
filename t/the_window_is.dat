5000|$|Upon {{examination}} by {{stained glass}} experts, <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> revealed {{to have been}} designed and crafted by Louis Comfort Tiffany, {{the son of the}} founder of Tiffany & Co. [...] Twelve of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> consisted of geometric and floral patterns mingled with religious symbols. The thirteenth and largest window depicted Jesus with his hand raised in benediction. Experts determined that <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> dedicated to E. St. Clair Thompson, a wealthy Freemason interred at Abbey Mausoleum in 1933. [...] <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> probably commissioned by the Thompson family. Many of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> damaged by vandalism, and most had suffered cracks, fading, and missing pieces due to neglect and age.|$|R
5|$|Above <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>is</b> {{the album}} title {{and at the}} top of the cover is the band's name in a {{typeface}} more crafty than on previous album covers. Though the general design of the cover is that of a 1930s hotel in style, the typeface juxtaposes the general design with being a rather futuristic, science-fiction styled typeset. This is the second futuristic style that the band has used for their name, the first appearing on Vulture Street.|$|E

Then, the singer is shown singing while playing the song on a piano, interpolated with images of Gonzalez on a small flat. Moments after, a man is shown inside the flat alongside Gonzalez, as {{she is about to}} dance and have sex with him. After they had sex, the man puts some bills on the table and leaves the room. Then, Gonzalez is shown drinking wine before committing suicide inside the bathtub. As of 16 August 2012, the video has reached 4.1 million views on YouTube.|$|E

25|$|These are {{the first}} Canadian notes {{produced}} on polymer. In place of a watermark are two visual features: a translucent maple leaf and a transparent window. The leaf includes a security feature that, when viewed close to the eye with a single-point light source behind, produces a circular image displaying the note's denomination. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>is</b> fringed by maple leaves; at its top is a smaller version of the portrait, and at its bottom a light-refracting metallic likeness of an architectural feature from the parliament buildings. The portraits on the face are more centred on the note. The backs of the notes introduce new cultural and thematic imagery, but the literary quotation is not continued. The polymer notes continue the tactile feature, from the Canadian Journey series.|$|E
25|$|Above {{the west}} tower door {{is a large}} blocked pointed arch, {{chamfered}} above the spring, and vertically edged with round moulded jambs ending in open cusped devices. Around the arch is a hood mould. Within the arch is a 14th-century (Pevsner) or late 15th-century (National Heritage) window surrounded by a hood mould. The window opening jambs are single-chamfered, with the arch double-chamfered, and lead to a Perpendicular window. The lower part of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>is</b> of three lights, separated by chamfered mullions and divided and topped by transoms containing castellated details, with tracery of trefoil heads and spandrels. Two further ranks of lights above are subdivided vertically into panel tracerya Perpendicular style of upright straight openings above lower lightswith 'Y' tracery, trefoil heads, and quatrefoil openings. All lights are clear glazed within diamond leading.|$|E
25|$|The nave is 13th {{century in}} origin, but was rebuilt in the 14th. At {{the west of}} the north wall is part of a 12th-century window, now blocked and not visible outside, abutted to the tower wall. The north wall window is 19th century within a 14th-century opening. At the east of the nave is an arch leading to the north transept. This {{chamfered}} arch was reused when the nave was widened in the 14th century, and is supported by semi-octagonal responds added in the 19th. The nave south wall arch to the south transept is 13th century, chamfered, with square responds. Between this transept arch and east wall is a blocked 15th-century doorway that led to the loft above a former rood screen. The part-restored south three-light window is late 15th century, but using some material from the 13th. To the west of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>is</b> the south doorway with moulded arch and hood mould. Between the south door and the tower wall is part of a 12th-century window, blocked, as mirror image to that on the north wall.|$|E

25|$|The chancel arch is double-chamfered on {{both sides}} with part-octagonal {{responds}} and crenellated capitals. At the lower part is a late 19th-century wooden rood screen of Perpendicular style, of three sectionsvoided in the centre section and void above with panelling below in the outer, and tracery above in all, the top line with crenellations. The chancel and both side chapels are separated by screens of the same style and date, and include openings to the north and south chapels. Sited at the face of the screens within the chancel, and part of the same design, are choir stalls of mirror repeat. Behind the screens are chapels, north and south, each defined by two Perpendicular chancel bays, the north with heavily moulded arches, the south double-chamfered. The north is set on side responds and central piers of semi-circular facets with hollows between, and part-octagonal capitals. The south is set on half-pier responds on part-octagonal capitals attached to extension of the arch double-chamfer. The chancel stained glass east window is by Ward and Hughes, c.1970. On either side of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>is</b> a corner niche with 19th-century figures. Further church stained glass is by Powell & Sons.|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{the other}} windows, this one shows four figures across the top portion. The first {{of these is the}} figure of the Victory of Peace, holding both a palm branch and the sword of judgement, while a dove flies overhead. The second person shown is that of Prosperity, who holds a wheat sheaf and a sicle, and, next to him, is Progress, bearing a winged wheel and with the Lamp of Knowledge above his head. The fourth figure is Plenty, symbolising the {{replenishment}} of both material and spirit through noble pursuit. Arranged in the lower portion of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>is</b> a crowd of people assembled in peace and led by three figures in the foreground and bearing the symbols of their trades: Industry holds a mallet and dynamo, Agriculture bears a scythe, Honour carries a torch inscribed with words from John McCrae's poem In Flanders Fields: BE THE TORCH YOURS TO HOLD IT HIGH, and Motherhood, who is surrounded by children. At the base of the second and third panels are the phrases: HE MAKETH WARS TO CEASE, from Psalm 46:9, and JUDGEMENT SHALL RETURN UNTO RIGHTEOUSNESS, from Psalm 94:15.|$|E
25|$|The {{first floor}} {{exterior}} wall consists of limestone quoins {{at the corner}} and stone coursing. A string course with Greek decorative carving is set {{between the first and}} second floors, and acts as the window sill for the second floor windows and as the balustrade for the entrance loggia. The second and third floor exterior walls have stone quoins as well. Between each window on the second floor is a panel inlaid with variegated marble and surrounded by egg-and-dart moldings. The base of the panel is decorated with scrollwork, and the top by a bas-relief urn. Five fruit-shaped clusters decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on this floor (the lowest cluster supported by a tiny putto), while above each window is a false pediment topped by an escutcheon flanked by drapery. Variegated marble panels are set between each window on the third floor as well, the bottom of each decorated with scrollwork and a small dramatic mask. The sill of each third floor window is of scrollwork, while <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>is</b> topped by scrollwork and a torch. Circular medallions with pendants decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on the third floor. A bas-relief putto stands atop each medallion and panel, supporting fruit swags. Between the third and fourth (or attic) floors is a molding decorated with repetitive small eggs which serves as the sill for the fourth floor windows. The truncated hipped roof slightly overhangs the walls. The cornice is decorated with dentils and acanthus carvings beneath the roofline. The roof, originally red tile, was changed at some point to asbestos roof shingles with copper flashing. There are seven chimneys on the roof, and about five skylights on the flat section.|$|E

500|$|Looking at {{the windows}} running along the nave, John L. Ward {{observed}} that the window directly above the suspended crucifix {{is the only one}} whose uppermost portion is visible. That window directly faces the viewer, revealing intricately designed stained glass panels that show intertwined red and blue flowers. Because <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>is</b> so far back in the pictorial space, where perspective is becoming faint, the proximity of the flowers to the crucifix lends them the appearance of coming [...] "forward in space, as if [...] had suddenly grown {{from the top of the}} crucifix in front of it." ...|$|E
500|$|The nave has two windows. [...] The south window, to {{the east}} of the vestry, is from the 14th century. [...] It has two lights (sections of window {{separated}} by mullions) with flat tops and is decorated with stone tracery. A survey of the church in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted the window’s [...] "crude workmanship and design." [...] The window on the north nave wall has three lights with rounded tops. It too has been dated to the 14th century, but other sources say that it is from the 16th century. [...] A 2009 guide to buildings of north-west Wales says that <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>is</b> [...] "typically 16th-century".|$|E
500|$|All day the Snowman gazes {{upon the}} stove, and, at twilight, the stove glows. When {{the door of}} the room is opened, the flames leap out of the stove and glow upon the snowman's face and chest. He is delighted. In the morning, <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>is</b> covered with frost and the Snowman cannot see the stove. He is stove-sick and cannot enjoy the frosty weather. [...] The dog warns the snowman of an {{imminent}} change in the weather. A thaw descends, and, one morning, the snowman collapses. The dog finds a stove poker used to build the snowman within his remains, and then understands why the snowman longed for the stove, [...] "That's what moved inside him...Now he is over that, too!" [...] The girls in the house sing a springtime carol and the snowman is forgotten.|$|E

5000|$|A set {{of windows}} {{designed}} by John La Farge, {{now in the}} collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts, <b>were</b> memorial <b>windows</b> dedicated to three trustees of the First Unitarian Church of Detroit. The central grouping of <b>windows</b> <b>was</b> dedicated to Charles Merrill and features two lancets entitled [...] "Faith" [...] (center left) and [...] "Hope" [...] (center right). The inscription beneath [...] "Hope" [...] comes from Psalm 119, reading [...] "The entrance of thy words giveth light." [...] <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> created in 1899 when the First Unitarian Church of Detroit built the congregation's second site. Eventually, the building was sold to the Church of Christ and <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> removed when <b>the</b> widening of Woodward Avenue was planned in 1936, necessitating a modification and move of the church building. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> never reinstalled and ultimately all but one of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> donated to <b>the</b> Detroit Institute of Arts in 1959 by the Unitarian Church Trust. <b>The</b> DIA <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> restored between 1988 and 1991 by Mary Clerkin Higgins and were dedicated in April 1991.|$|R
