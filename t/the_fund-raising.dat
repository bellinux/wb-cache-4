5|$|In 1641, Harvard University sent three preachers to England {{to raise}} money for missionary {{activities}} among the Indians. To support <b>the</b> <b>fund-raising,</b> the University produced one of the earliest fund-raising brochures, New England's First Fruits. An early version of the press release was used when King's College (now Columbia University), sent out an announcement of its 1758 graduation ceremonies and several newspapers printed the information. Princeton was the first university to make it a routine practice of supplying newspapers with information about activities at the college.|$|E

By that time, Wooden was in failing health and could not attend; he died three weeks later, slightly more than four months before his 100th birthday.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Bales {{teamed with}} Simon Pell, {{then head of}} Arts for Labour in the UK, to form <b>the</b> <b>fund-raising</b> and {{research}} consultancy, Pell & Bales Ltd.

25|$|The {{dedication}} {{ceremony for}} the Confederate Memorial {{was held on}} June 4, 1914. Although numerous dignitaries and Confederate groups were invited to attend, only a single Union veterans' group was asked to do so (because, the UDC said, there was limited seating). The Union veterans' group which was invited was the 23rd New Jersey Regiment, which made a major donation early in <b>the</b> <b>fund-raising</b> process. But its leaders {{could not be reached}} and no representative from the unit attended.|$|E
25|$|Bobcat Stadium, MSU's {{football}} arena, {{underwent a}} major expansion due to Cruzado's boosterism. Expansion {{of the football}} stadium was long planned, and provided for architecturally during its 1998 renovation. Boosters had already raised $1 million by October 2010. When Cruzado learned of <b>the</b> <b>fund-raising</b> effort, she publicly endorsed it and challenged boosters to raise another $4 million with in the year. If they did, the university would float $4 million in bonds to match it (with funding for the bonds coming from football ticket sales). Boosters subsequently raised another $5 million by late December 2010.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>fund-raising</b> {{success of}} the union and the {{pressure}} from the 40-hour work week drive pushed the employers {{to agree to a}} new collective bargaining agreement. The manufacturers signaled their willingness to talk on May 26, but the union kept up its demand for the 40-hour week. A mediator was called in, and a new contract reached on June 11, 1926. The contract provided for the 40-hour, five-day work week; an end to overtime from December through August; time-and-a-half overtime pay for half-days from September to November; a 10 percent wage increase; 10 paid holidays; and a ban on subcontracting.|$|E

25|$|On April 12, the Athenaeum and NPG {{agreed to}} delay the sale until December 31, 1979, to give the Boston {{fund-raising}} effort a chance. Although not completely successful, the lawsuit had one effect: Attorney General Bellotti announced in mid-summer that the Stuart portraits could not be sold without his permission. By November 1979, <b>the</b> <b>fund-raising</b> campaign had netted only $885,631, with a pledge from the Museum of Fine Arts to match the amount if necessary. This left the campaign $4 million short of the purchase price. The Athenaeum refused to lower the price, describing the $5 million listing as a significant discount from the portraits' real value.|$|E
25|$|Painting classes, and {{professional}} artists doing finished works often require clothed or costumed models who take poses {{that may be}} sustained until the work is completed. This creates some demand for clothed models in those schools that continue to teach academic painting methods. Some models may promote their services based upon having interesting or varied costumes. Clothing is required in public venues, such as Dr Sketchy's Anti-Art School, but occurs in more traditional settings as well, such as <b>the</b> <b>fund-raising</b> marathons sponsored by the Bay Area Models Guild. Other than costumes, the work requirements and conditions of clothed models for art are identical to that of nude models.|$|E
25|$|Plans for {{erecting}} {{a memorial}} to Butt and Millet began shortly after {{the introduction of the}} Senate resolution. Taft agreed to chair the memorial committee. Taft's personal secretary, Charles D. Hilles, and his military aide, Colonel Spencer Cosby, led <b>the</b> <b>fund-raising</b> on behalf of the committee. Charles J. Bell of the American Security and Trust Company was the treasurer. Members of the foreign diplomatic corps and several high government officials had already donated several thousand dollars to the memorial fund by mid-May. Taft himself had made the first contribution. At this point in time, The Ellipse (the southern part of President's Park) was chosen for the site of the memorial. However, the memorial committee was thinking only of erecting a bronze tablet.|$|E

25|$|During Cruzado's {{presidency}} {{there have}} been several notable successes in the area of advancement. Alumnus Jake Jabs agreed to donate $3 million in December 2010 to add to the endowment of the Jake Jabs Center for Entrepreneurship for the New West, a unit of the MSU College of Business. It was his second major donation to the center. After alumni quietly raised $1 million to expand Bobcat Stadium, Cruzado went public in October 2010 with a campaign to raise an additional $4 million and agreed to match <b>the</b> <b>fund-raising</b> up to $4 million with university funds. The campaign was a rousing success, raising $5 million in private funds in less than a year. In 2011, alumnus David Kern and his wife, Judith Raines, donated $1 million to MSU to establish the Presidential Award for Emerging Scholars. The award targets students who may not be academically outstanding, but who exhibit great promise in leadership, academics, or research. It was the second major gift from Kern and Raines, who previously established an engineering scholarship in 2002. In October 2012, the university received one of its largest gifts ever when Jabs donated an additional $25 million to build a new business school building. Courting of Jabs had occurred for a decade. The donation was the largest in MSU history.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Derek Green, Lundy's general manager, {{launched}} {{an appeal to}} raise £250,000 to save the mile-long Beach Road, which had been damaged by heavy rain and high seas.

500|$|Unlike the Discovery expedition, where {{fundraising}} {{was handled}} {{jointly by the}} Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society, the Terra Nova Expedition was organised as a private venture without significant institutional support. Scott estimated the total cost at £40,000 ( [...] at 2009 values), half of which was eventually met by a government grant. The balance was raised by public subscription and loans. The expedition was further assisted by the free supply {{of a range of}} provisions and equipment from sympathetic commercial firms. <b>The</b> <b>fund-raising</b> task was largely carried out by Scott, and was a considerable drain on his time and energy, continuing in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand after Terra Nova had sailed from British waters.|$|E
