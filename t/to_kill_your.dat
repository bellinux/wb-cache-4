2500|$|The {{historical}} text Han Jin Chunqiu {{mentioned that}} Cao Rui had all along {{been aware of}} his mother's fate, and he was angry and sad about it. After he became emperor, his stepmother Guo Nüwang became the empress dowager. When he asked her about how his mother died, Guo replied, [...] "The Late Emperor {{was the one who}} ordered her death, so why are you asking me? You're your father's son so you can blame your dead father. Are you going <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>your</b> stepmother for your real mother?" [...] Cao Rui turned furious and forced Empress Dowager Guo to commit suicide. He had her buried with the funeral rites befitting that of an empress, but also ordered her dead body to be treated {{in the same manner as}} she did to his mother – hair covering face, mouth stuffed with rice husks. However, the historical text Weilüe stated that after Empress Dowager Guo died of illness in 235, Cao Pi's concubine Lady Li (李夫人) told Cao Rui about the fate of his mother. Cao Rui was deeply grieved and he ordered Guo's dead body to be treated in the same manner as she did to his mother.|$|E
