And the wall behind--? Yes. Its deep brown was darkened to an absolute black behind the jar, and shaded up between the lacquer cabinets on either hand by insensible degrees to the general hue. It was wonderful, perfectly harmonious, and so subtly planned that it seemed it all might have grown, as flowers grow....|$|R

40|$|Colour {{preference}} {{among children}} has been explored {{in a variety}} of populations and cultures. However, there is scanty research on the psychology of colour and, in particular, colour preference among children in Nigeria. Sixty (60) children (30 males and 30 females) randomly drawn from a population of students of a Montessori School in Ibadan, Nigeria participated in the study. A One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for Repeated Measures Design was used to test five hypotheses stated in the study. Results identified the order of colour preference by the children as red, yellow, <b>tint,</b> <b>white,</b> green, blue, brown and black. Red and yellow were significantly preferred to black. There was significant difference in order of colour among female children, children of age group 9 - 12 years and children of age group 3 - 8 years. In conclusion, red and yellow prove to be more stimulating and attractive than any other colour. These findings will be helpful to teaching agencies, and advertising companies and entrepreneurs that major in the production of children materials to know the right colour to use on their products...|$|R

25|$|In both geometries, the {{additive}} {{primary and}} secondary colors—red, yellow, green, cyan, blue and magenta—and linear mixtures between adjacent pairs of them, sometimes called pure colors, are arranged around the outside edge of the cylinder with saturation 1. These saturated colors have lightness ½ in HSL, while in HSV they have value 1. Mixing these pure colors with black—producing so-called shades—leaves saturation unchanged. In HSL, saturation is also unchanged by <b>tinting</b> with <b>white,</b> and only mixtures with both black and white—called tones—have saturation less than 1. In HSV, tinting alone reduces saturation.|$|R
50|$|A {{complementary}} process, called toning, {{replaces the}} silver {{particles in the}} film with metallic salts or mordanted dyes.
