5|$|Several {{species of}} storm petrel are {{threatened}} by human activities. One species, <b>the</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> storm petrel, {{is thought to have}} gone extinct. The principal threats to storm petrels are introduced species, particularly mammals, in their breeding colonies; many storm petrels habitually nest on isolated mammal-free islands and are unable to cope with predators like rats and feral cats.|$|E
5|$|Subduction of <b>the</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> Plate/Farallon Plate beneath Baja California was {{prevalent}} in the region until 12,5–11 million years ago; volcanic activity since then is due to tectonic changes associated {{with the development of}} the Gulf of California. Earlier subduction-related volcanism during the Miocene formed the volcanic deposits of the Comondú Group.|$|E

5|$|Green Lake formed {{initially}} as {{a northern}} inlet of San Antonio Bay. As <b>the</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> River shifted westward about 2,500 years ago, it deposited silt, developing a delta that prograded into San Antonio Bay. Around 2,200years ago the delta discharge extended completely across the bay, severing the northern extension from the system, which formed present-day Green Lake. Pottery and burial grounds {{found in the}} area suggest a presence of Karankawa Indians {{at the time of}} formation. Middens uncovered north of the lake contained shells from the brackish water-species of rangia clams (rangia cuneata).|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} landfall, the NHC issued a {{tropical}} storm warning from Baffin Bay, Texas to Rio San Fernando, Mexico; this was canceled once the storm failed to intensify. The Servicio Meteorológico Nacional warned residents of gusty winds and heavy rainfall in excess of 4–8in (100–200mm) capable of producing localized flooding and mudslides. Upon moving ashore, the depression produced a storm surge of 2–4ft (0.6–1.2m) along the southern coastline of Texas. Rainfall accumulations peaked at 5.16in (131mm) along <b>the</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> River, with lesser amounts elsewhere, including across areas affected by Hurricane Alex a week prior.|$|E
5|$|In {{the area}} around Green Lake there are forests of pecan, black willow, cedar, American elm, {{hackberry}} and green ash. To the south, <b>the</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> Delta Wildlife Management Area serves as a wetland habitat for thousands of permanent egrets, and other birds, including the brown pelican, reddish egret, white-faced ibis, wood stork, bald eagle, white-tailed hawk, peregrine falcon, and the whooping crane. American alligators reside in the area as well.|$|E

50|$|Coatlaxopeuh {{is a word}} {{proposed}} by father Mariano Jacobo Rojas of Tepoztlán as a possible Nahuatl origin of <b>the</b> word <b>Guadalupe,</b> <b>the</b> appellation of <b>the</b> Virgin of <b>Guadalupe.</b> <b>The</b> suggestion of a Nahuatl etymology for the Virgin's name {{was part of the}} Mexican indigenista debates of the mid 20th century, in which prominent intellectuals reinterpreted Mexican history with a renewed emphasis on the nation's indigenous heritage. In addition to coatlaxopeuh many other proposed Nahuatl etymologies of Guadalupe have been suggested, but in the devotional literature coatlaxopeuh remains the most accepted.|$|R
5|$|Redfish and trout {{were once}} the main {{species of fish}} living in the lake, until the {{construction}} of an embankment reduced their populations. A large quantity of silt is now deposited in the lake from <b>the</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> River, after the dredging of a freshwater channel that supplies farmers and the Union Carbide plant in Seadrift. The channel has negatively affected the delta ecosystem by diminishing the river's nutritional input.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{face the}} same threats as other seabirds; in {{particular}} they are threatened by introduced species. <b>The</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> storm petrel was driven to extinction by feral cats, and introduced predators have also been responsible for declines in other species. Habitat degradation which limits nesting opportunities caused by introduced goats and pigs is also a problem, especially if it increases competition from more aggressive burrowing petrels.|$|E
5|$|To improve drainage, a levee was {{constructed}} in 1967, separating the lake from the Victoria Barge Canal, which runs along the bay's northern and eastern shores; cutting off several bayous from the lake. The canal begins north at an industrial plant outside Victoria and empties in San Antonio Bay in Seadrift. Hog Bayou runs along the western shore of Green Lake, through <b>the</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> Delta Wildlife Management Area to the south, before its confluence with Mission Lake.|$|E

5|$|Every second, {{approximately}} 28 cubed {{meters of}} water {{flows into the}} bay. The exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Cedar Bayou and Aransas Pass. As {{a result of the}} seawater exchange, the bay's salinity is 15 parts per thousand, compared to the seawater average of 35 ppt. This discrepancy is brought about by the volume of fresh water that empties into the bay and its extensions, from Copano Creek, Mission River and Aransas River, forming the Mission-Aransas estuary. Fresh water flows also arrive from the impact of <b>the</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> River on San Antonio Bay. Combined, the fresh water influence is 60 to 70 percent of the system's volume, which is judged to be minimal.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 1835, a {{detachment}} of 100 dragoons, led by Francisco de Castañeda, left San Antonio de Béxar, carrying an official order for Ponton to surrender the cannon. Castañeda had {{been instructed to}} avoid using force if possible. When the troops neared Gonzales on September 29, {{they found that the}} settlers had removed the ferry and all other boats from <b>the</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> River. On {{the other side of the}} swiftly moving river waited eighteen Texians. Albert Martin, captain of the Gonzales militia, informed the soldiers that Ponton was out of town, and until his return the army must remain on the west side of the river.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area {{is home to}} {{a complex}} network of watersheds, marshes, rivers, creeks, reservoirs, and bays that {{predominantly}} drain into the San Francisco Bay and Pacific Ocean. The largest bodies of water in the Bay Area are the San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun estuaries. Major rivers of the North Bay include the Napa River, the Petaluma River, the Gualala River, and the Russian River; the former two drain into San Pablo Bay, the latter two into the Pacific Ocean. In the South Bay, <b>the</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> River drains into San Francisco Bay near Alviso. There are also several lakes present in the Bay Area, including man-made lakes like Lake Berryessa and natural albeit heavily modified lakes like Lake Merritt.|$|E
5000|$|Flood {{protection}} is provided for nearly 250 square miles (647 km²) of land downstream from Canyon Dam. The canyons of <b>the</b> upper <b>Guadalupe</b> River have {{a capacity to}} carry 40,000 - 50,000 cubic feet per second (1,100 - 1,400 m³/s) however, the channel on <b>the</b> lower <b>Guadalupe</b> River, downstream from the Balcones Escarpment, can carry only 13,000-30,000 cubic feet per second (400 - 800 m³/s). This has led to serious flooding in <b>the</b> lower <b>Guadalupe</b> River Basin, including a major flood in New Braunfels in 1972 which was caused by heavy rains just downstream from Canyon Dam.|$|R

5000|$|Parque Nacional El Tepeyac shares part of {{the hills}} of Santa Isabel and Guerrero with <b>the</b> Basilica of <b>Guadalupe.</b> El Tepeyac is famous for being, {{according}} to the Catholic faith, the site where <b>the</b> Virgin of <b>Guadalupe</b> appeared to Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin the first Latin American indigenous who witnessed the apparition of <b>the</b> Virgin of <b>Guadalupe</b> in 1531. Currently {{at the foot of}} the hills of Santa Isabel and Guerrero is <b>the</b> Basilica of <b>Guadalupe</b> (<b>the</b> monumental complex dedicated to Virgin Guadalupe), which every year receives millions of pilgrims, especially on December 12. It is considered the main American Catholic religious meeting point and one of the most visited in the world with annually twenty million visitors.|$|R
5|$|The Presidio La Bahía {{was moved}} from <b>the</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> River to Goliad on the San Antonio River in 1749. Within five years, a new mission for the Karankawa tribes, Nuestra Señora del Rosario de los Cuhanes, was built {{upstream}} of the presidio. This mission survived for many years. Despite the new missions and presidios, Texas {{was one of}} the least populated provinces on the northern frontier of New Spain. By 1760, almost 1,200Hispanic people lived in Texas, with half in San Antonio, 350 at Los Adaes, and 260 at La Bahía. Other Spaniards lived in what is now the El Paso area, but that was considered part of New Mexico and not part of Texas.|$|E
5|$|In 1776, Indians at the Bahia {{missions}} {{told the}} soldiers that the Karankawas had massacred {{a group of}} Europeans who had been shipwrecked {{near the mouth of}} <b>the</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> River. After finding the remains of an English commercial frigate, the soldiers warned the Karankawa to refrain from attacking seamen. The soldiers continued to explore the coast, and reported that foreign powers could easily build a small settlement on the barrier islands, which were difficult to access from the mainland, and then ascend the Trinity or San Jacinto Rivers into the heart of Texas. Captain Luis Cazorla, the commander of the La Bahía presidio, recommended that Spain build a small fort on the barrier islands and provide a shallow-draft vessel to continually reconnoiter the coast. The fort would be both a deterrent to the more bloodthirsty tribes and to the English. The Spanish government, fearful of smuggling, declined to give permission for a port or a boat on the Texas coast.|$|E
5|$|The Karankawa Indians {{used the}} land near <b>the</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> River delta and San Antonio Bay for camping purposes. They also {{populated}} Matagorda Island {{on the opposite}} side of the bay. Captain Luis Cazorla of Presidio La Bahía crossed San Antonio Bay to visit the island in 1776, and discovered that the Indians had killed the mates of a shipwrecked British trading vessel. For a short time, he convinced the Indian leaders not to kill shipwreck survivors on the island. An effort was made to convert the Indians with the establishment of Mission Refugio on San Antonio Bay in 1793, after Fray José Francisco Garza found a shallow crossing that the Indians used to travel to the mainland. To prevent the Indians from using Matagorda Island as a hiding place to stage attacks, La Bahía commandant Juan Cortés burned and cut brush around the point of crossing. No permanent colony was ever established on the island.|$|E

5|$|The state {{legislature}} extended the highway in 1925, defining it {{to run from}} near the intersection of Army Street (Cesar Chavez Street) and San Bruno Avenue in San Francisco to a point in San Jose. The governor approved the bill with the stipulation that only the portion between the city limits of San Francisco and San Jose would be a state highway. Construction between South San Francisco and Burlingame had begun by 1924, funded by a $500,000 contribution from San Francisco, and was completed in 1928. A disconnected segment north of San Mateo was built by the state at the same time. It was not until February 1929 that the road was fully paved between San Francisco and Burlingame, and on October 20, 1929 the new highway was officially dedicated to San Mateo, several months after the connecting San Mateo-Hayward Bridge opened (at what is now Third Avenue). Even then, motorists {{had to wait until}} May 7, 1931 to reach Jefferson Avenue in Redwood City (near the west end of the four-year-old Dumbarton Bridge). The roadway was extended to Oregon Avenue in Palo Alto in mid-1932, Lawrence Station Road in mid-1933, and to Lafayette Street near Santa Clara, across <b>the</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> River from San Jose, by 1934. The final piece to Oakland Road (13th Street) in San Jose, which was then the main road - Legislative Route 5 and Sign Route 17 - between San Jose and Oakland, was dedicated on June 12, 1937, over ten years after the Dumbarton Bridge opened in January 1927.|$|E
