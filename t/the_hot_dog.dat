The band achieved mainstream success with their second and third studio albums, Significant Other (1999) and Chocolate Starfish and <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Dog</b> Flavored Water (2000), although this success was marred {{by a series of}} controversies surrounding their performances at Woodstock '99 and the 2001 Big Day Out festival.|$|E

There the babies find popcorn, orange and grape sodas, lids, napkins, cups, candy bars, ketchup, mustard and straws (the two teenage employees in charge, Larry and Steve, don't notice the babies because they're arguing over comic books). Tommy checks the popcorn both for Reptar, while Phil and Lil take {{interest in the}} soda dispensers, pushing the buttons and spilling the soft drinks on the counters and floors until eventually they get stuck continuously pouring soda. Meanwhile, Chuckie, after sampling some candy, notices some stairs leading up while Phil and Lil start playing with the ketchup and mustard dispensers by <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>dog</b> sections. Phil & Lil plays with straws and spill all the straws. After Chuckie points out the stairs, Tommy concludes they'll find Reptar upstairs. As soon as the babies leave, the two teenagers notice the massive mess and scream.|$|E
5|$|At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu {{is selling}} items to {{customers}} at outrageous prices, like normal. Apu scribbles out the 1989 expiration date on {{a package of}} ham and then lowers the price instead of throwing it out. Homer buys the meat, eats it, and contracts food poisoning. After recovering, Homer returns to the Kwik-E-Mart to complain, and Apu gives him two five-pound buckets of expired shrimp to placate him. Homer eats the shrimp and becomes ill again. Whilst recovering at home, Homer sees the Channel 6 investigative news program Bite Back with Kent Brockman. Lisa gives him the idea to get the show to investigate the Kwik-E-Mart. Kent gives Homer a giant novelty hat containing a spy camera to expose Apu for selling expired food. Though Homer almost immediately abandons the hat after mistaking the buzzing of the machinery as a bee, the camera catches Apu placing a hot dog that he had dropped on the ground back into <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>dog</b> cooker. Apu is immediately fired by his company (even though he was actually following company policy), and is replaced by actor James Woods, who is doing research for a role in an upcoming film.|$|E

However, a <b>hot</b> <b>dog</b> stand is normally a permanent or semi-permanent structure, whereas a <b>hot</b> <b>dog</b> cart is movable. Similarly, <b>hot</b> <b>dog</b> trucks are motor vehicles that are set up at a roadside location, and often include a complete kitchen for storage and preparation. [...] In Denmark, <b>hot</b> <b>dog</b> stands are called Pølsevogn (sausage wagons). They serve traditional <b>hot</b> <b>dogs</b> as well as assorted sausages and sausage meats. In Toronto, <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>dogs</b> from <b>hot</b> <b>dog</b> stands are often called [...] "street meat".|$|R

2500|$|A <b>hot</b> <b>dog</b> (also spelled hotdog), {{also known}} as a {{frankfurter}} (sometimes shortened to frank) or wiener, is a cooked sausage, traditionally grilled or steamed and served in a partially sliced bun.

25|$|Hot {{dogs are}} {{prepared}} and eaten {{in a variety}} of ways. The wieners may be boiled, grilled, fried, steamed, broiled, baked, or microwaved.

Various models of hot dog toasters exist that cook <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>dog</b> and buns by toasting.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary American society also {{witnessed}} {{the creation of}} new fast foods that originated from the traditional cuisine of various ethnic groups from around the world. For example, German immigrant Charles Feltman invented <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>dog</b> in 1867 in his stall in Coney Island, New York by pairing a frankfurter with a bread bun. Imitators such as Harry Magley and Charles Stevens soon began selling hot dogs at New York Polo Grounds baseball games. Similarly, Italian immigrants sold ice cream from vending carts in the streets or pasta at their restaurants. Chinese immigrants initially opened restaurants to cater to their fellow Chinese-Americans, but they gradually became accepted by the American clientele, sometimes resulting in truly Chinese-American cuisine such as chop suey. In this diverse world of ethnic foods, the hamburger was able to rise to mainstream popularity and become a national food of the United States.|$|E
25|$|The numbers {{involved}} in this cottage industry were considerable: a rooftop bleacher could hold up to 80 people, with 18 more in the bay window of the front bedroom and more even on the porch roof. Viewers on the block could number up to several thousand for important games. Housewives served up refreshments for sale and children scurried to <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>dog</b> vendors on the street, bought dogs for a nickel, and brought them back to sell for a dime. With so much money on the line, the business got organized and formalized very quickly; homeowners were soon squeezed for bribes by city amusement tax collectors, and city police collected commissions for collaring and herding fans from the sidewalk into particular homes. By 1929, the extra income from the rooftop bleachers actually caused real estate values to climb on the 2700 block of N. 20th Street.|$|E

Chocolate Starfish and <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Dog</b> Flavored Water was certified Gold, Platinum and six times Multi-Platinum. The album received mixed reviews, with Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing, [...] "Durst's self-pitying and the monotonous music give away that the band bashed Chocolate Starfish out very quickly – it's {{the sound of a}} band determined to deliver a sequel in a finite amount of time." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer David Browne named it as the worst album title of 2000.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Durst {{announced}} that the band's third studio album would be titled Chocolate Starfish and <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Dog</b> Flavored Water.

The album title is intended {{to sound like a}} fictional band; the phrase [...] "Chocolate Starfish" [...] refers to the human anus, and Durst himself, who has frequently been called an [...] "asshole". Borland contributed {{the other half of the}} album's title when the band was standing around at a truck stop, looking at bottles of flavored water, and Borland joked that the truck stop didn't have hot dog or meat-flavored water.|$|E
