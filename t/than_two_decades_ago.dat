40|$|Challenged by {{a global}} crisis, the {{building}} industry is currently seeking new orientation and strategies. Stakeholders in {{the built environment}} are being forced at an extensive and unprecedented pace to improve a set of conflicting objectives. On one hand, they want to enhance the cost efficiency and economic sustainability of their constructions. On the other hand, the market demands that the functional performance, indoor quality, comfort levels and social sustainability of the building shall be increased. And at the same time, building professionals concentrate on the reduction of energy consumption, the ecological footprint of a building process and its carbon emission, boosting the environmental sustainability. Finally, designers also have distinct aesthetic values {{they would like to}} realise in their design. This apparently conflicting set of goals demands a new industrial paradigm in the built environment. In industrial markets, mass customisation emerged more <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago</b> as a paradigm for exactly this purpose - offering highly customised products with mass production efficiency. From its origins in machinery and IT hardware mass customisation recently gained growing popularity in consumer goods industries.

This scenario has extended from its limited basis to become fully grown Consortia of various kinds. Since India is a developing country, we constantly work towards improving our infrastructure and technology {{to meet the demands}} of our scientists and researchers by taking the lead from the developed countries. By utilizing the support of the regional & national level networking, libraries in India should cooperatively establish library consortia for offering and sharing electronic resources. Many libraries, especially research libraries in India, have their own network existing within their own locations. These networks can be expanded to enhance the access to the information resources through collaborative partnerships, in the form of Consortia. Since this Consortia idea is still at a nascent stage in Indian libraries, it is essential to have some ideal Consortia models for our libraries to adhere to for optimum utilization of their resources and services. Today Consortium's purpose is shifted from mere sharing of resources to sharing of expertise between libraries and also to explore the need for libraries to make the most effective use of their funds collectively. This is an essential future aspect to be considered seriously in libraries of India. Attempts have been made here to illuminate the idea of forming a national level consortium of Indian academic libraries (IALC) and delineate its benefits...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{modified}} damped harmonic oscillator model {{equivalent to a}} model of market dynamics with price expectations, we analyze the reaction of financial markets to shocks.

Analyzing those data we were able to establish the amount by which each market felt the shocks, a dampening factor which expresses the capacity of a market of absorving a shock, and also a frequency related with volatility after the shock. The results gauge the efficiency of different markets in recovering from such shocks, and measure some level of dependence between them.

Estimates were made of mean body mass and proportion of the diet comprised {{of each of the}} three main prey types. Cetaceans of the Northeast Shelf were found to consume nearly 1. 9 million tons annually, including about 1. 3 million tons of fish, 337 000 tons of squid and 244 000 tons of zooplankton. Their predation on fish and squid exceeded tonnages harvested in the commercial fishing industry.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Swine {{production}} facilities today are larger {{in size and}} are concentrated in smaller geographical areas <b>than</b> they were <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>ago.</b> Additionally, there is an increasing trend to base manure land application rates on crop phosphorus requirements rather than crop nitrogen requirements alone. These factors {{have resulted in a}} need to find a feasible method for removing phosphorus from swine waste prior to land application. Economically concentrating and transporting excess phosphorus to phosphorus deficient cropping areas would benefit the current production scheme. Forced precipitation of phosphorus as struvite (MgNH 4 PO 46 H 2 O) is an option for phosphorus concentration and removal. Economic feasibility of phosphorus precipitation improves when reactive phosphorus represents a high percentage of the total phosphorus in slurry, and when a limited amount of chemical amendment is required for the precipitation reaction. In this study, anaerobic digestion of swine slurry increased reactive phosphorus (PO 43 ‐) and magnesium ion (Mg 2 +) in solution by 26 % and 254 %, respectively. Additionally, during phosphorus precipitation experiments, PO 43 ‐ removal and reduction efficiencies were greatest in the tests performed with anaerobically digested swine slurry...|$|R

This article challenges this Neo-Realist argument. Drawing on Keohane's and Nye's concepts of interdependence sensitivity and vulnerability, it both tests the actual degree of EU energy dependence {{and the extent to which}} dependence may create Russian leverage. It is found that the actual EU supply dependence is overrated and is mainly due to the EU's internal divisions. Secondly, Russia's potential leverage is undermined by its high dependence on EU energy demand. Thirdly, its potential energy leverage is at least counterbalanced by other dimensions of asymmetrical interdependence outside the energy context. Explaining how geopolitical power-related explanations became dominant in the analysis of EU-Russia relations, this article refers both to structural changes in the energy market and also to new perceptions that resulted from a renewed geopolitical logic in early decisions over pipelines, changing attitudes as Russia grew stronger and the different nature of the energy markets in the EU and Russia. While geopolitical considerations may occasionally sneak in, the core of EU-Russia energy relations is still predominantly economic and commercial...|$|R

These results confirm that there has been no decline in mobility, whether considered in absolute or relative terms. In the case of women, there is in fact evidence of mobility increasing. However, the better quality and extended range of our data enable us to identify other ‘mobility problems’ than the supposed decline.
