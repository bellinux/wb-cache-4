5|$|A {{midazolam}} overdose {{is considered}} a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, <b>the</b> <b>toxicity</b> of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. <b>The</b> <b>toxicity</b> of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used {{within an hour of}} the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E

Besides, if the 95  % confidence interval of M includes 1, <b>the</b> joint <b>toxicity</b> was additive in nature.|$|R
30|$|CAR-T cells offer a {{promising}} new therapy for cancers, but <b>the</b> <b>toxicities</b> elicited in <b>the</b> clinical trials {{are still a}} great concern. Deaths with CAR-T were reported previously (Morgan et al., 2010; Brentjens et al., 2010) and recently (DeFrancesco 2016), {{which has been a}} wake-up call to <b>the</b> potential for <b>toxicity</b> of CAR-T cell therapy (Junghans 2010). <b>The</b> <b>toxicities</b> of CAR-T cell therapy generally fall into several of the following categories.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{predicted}} <b>toxicity</b> of {{mixtures of}} imidazolium and pyridinium ionic liquids (ILs) in {{the ratios of}} their EC 50, EC 10, and NOEC (no observed effect concentration) were compared to <b>the</b> observed <b>toxicity</b> of these mixtures on luciferase. <b>The</b> <b>toxicities</b> of EC 50 ratio mixture can be effectively predicted by two-stage prediction (TSP) method, but were overestimated by the concentration addition (CA) model and underestimated by the independent action (IA) model. <b>The</b> <b>toxicities</b> of EC 10 ratio mixtures can be basically predicted by TSP and CA, but were underestimated by IA. <b>The</b> <b>toxicities</b> of NOEC ratio mixtures can be predicted by TSP and CA in a certain concentration range, but were underestimated by IA. Our results {{support the use of}} TSP as a default approach for predicting the combined effect of different types of ILs at the molecular level. In addition, mixtures of ILs mixed at NOEC and EC 10 could cause significant effects of 64. 1 % and 97. 7 %, respectively.

5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes <b>the</b> <b>toxicity</b> of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E
30|$|According to Zheng and Feng (2006), <b>the</b> joint <b>toxicities</b> include {{four main}} types: {{independent}} effect (INE), additive effect (ADE), synergistic effect (SYE) and antagonistic effect (ANE). Different approaches {{used to assess}} <b>the</b> combined <b>toxicities</b> include toxic unit (TU) (Marking and Dawson 1975) and mixture toxic index (MTI) (Konemann 1981).

5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges. It {{is often said}} that sponges produce {{chemical}} defenses against such predators. However an experiment showed {{that there is no}} relationship between <b>the</b> <b>toxicity</b> of chemicals produced by sponges and how they taste to fish, which would diminish the usefulness of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish may even help to spread sponges by detaching fragments.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{toxicity}} has {{not been}} seen in humans, and <b>the</b> <b>toxicity</b> depends strongly on the chemical state. Studies on rats show a median lethal dose (LD50) as low as 180mg/kg for some Mo compounds. Although human toxicity data is unavailable, animal studies have shown that chronic ingestion of more than 10mg/day of molybdenum can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, infertility, low birth weight, and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys, and liver. Sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum. Dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues.|$|E
5|$|At these sites, {{the study}} also found averages of 1.7, 2.23, and 5.56 parts per million of aluminum, respectively. Concentrations of {{aluminium}} higher than 100 to 200 parts per million can cause suffocation of fish by accumulating in their gills. <b>The</b> <b>toxicity</b> of aluminum to fish is increased by a water pH of below 4.5 to 6.5. There were also 0.65, 0.81, and 1.84 parts per million of iron in these sites, and 0.96, 1.15, 0.03, and 2.65 parts per million of manganese.

40|$|Growing {{concern that}} phthalic acid esters (PAE) may present a health hazard and {{possible}} deleterious {{effects on the}} ecological system has led to increased interest in <b>the</b> more subtle <b>toxicity</b> of those compounds. Although <b>the</b> acute <b>toxicity</b> of PAEs as a group is quite low, <b>the</b> intrinsic cellular <b>toxicity</b> increases with molecular weight. Whether <b>the</b> intrinsic <b>toxicity</b> is great enough to exert a significant effect in vivo at the typically low levels of solubility of PAEs is of primary importance to the assessment of their potential hazard.

5|$|Bismuth {{compounds}} {{account for}} about half the production of bismuth. They are used in cosmetics, pigments, and a few pharmaceuticals, notably bismuth subsalicylate, used to treat diarrhea. Bismuth's unusual propensity to expand upon freezing is responsible for some of its uses, such as in casting of printing type. Bismuth has unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal. As <b>the</b> <b>toxicity</b> of lead has become more apparent in recent years, there is an increasing use of bismuth alloys (presently {{about a third of}} bismuth production) as a replacement for lead.|$|E
5|$|Elemental iodine (I2) is toxic if taken orally undiluted. The {{lethal dose}} {{for an adult}} human is 30mg/kg, which is about 2.1–2.4grams for a human {{weighing}} 70 to 80kg (even if experiments on rats demonstrated that these animals could survive after eating a 14000mg/kg dose). Excess iodine can be more cytotoxic {{in the presence of}} selenium deficiency. Iodine supplementation in selenium-deficient populations is, in theory, problematic, partly for this reason. <b>The</b> <b>toxicity</b> derives from its oxidizing properties, through which it denaturates proteins (including enzymes).|$|E
5|$|Ethylene glycol is a colorless, odorless, sweet liquid, {{commonly}} found in antifreeze. It may be drunk accidentally or purposefully {{in an attempt to}} cause death.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>toxicities</b> and uptake {{mechanisms}} of two hepatotoxins, namely cylindrospermopsin and lophyrotomin, were investigated on {{primary rat hepatocytes}} by using microcystin-LIZ (a well-known hepatotoxin produced by cyanobacteria) as a comparison. Isolated rat hepatocytes were incubated with different concentrations of hepatotoxins for 0, 24, 48 and 72 h. The cell viability was assayed by the tetrazolium-based (MTT) assay. Microcystin-LR, cylindrospermopsin and lophyrotomin all exhibited toxic effects on the primary rat hepatocytes with 72 -h LC 50 of 8, 40 and 560 ng/ml, respectively. The involvement of the bile acid transport system in <b>the</b> hepatotoxin-induced <b>toxicities</b> was tested {{in the presence of}} two bile acids, cholate and taurocholate. Results showed that the bile acid transport system was responsible for the uptake, and facilitated <b>the</b> subsequent <b>toxicities</b> of lophyrotomin on hepatocytes. This occurred to a much lesser extent with cylindrospermopsin. With its smaller molecular weight, passive diffusion might be one of the possible mechanisms for cylindrospermopsin uptake into hepatocytes. This was supported by incubating a permanent cell line, KB (devoid of bile acid transport system), with cylindrospermopsin which showed cytotoxic effects. No inhibition of protein phosphatase 2 A by cylindrospermopsin or lophyrotomin was found. This indicated that other toxic mechanisms besides protein phosphatase inhibition were producing <b>the</b> <b>toxicities</b> of cylindrospermopsin and lophyrotomin, and that they were unlikely to be potential tumor promoters.
