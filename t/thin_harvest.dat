40|$|Abstract�Specialty crops {{constitute}} a $ 45 billion/year industry. As opposed to {{crops such as}} wheat, cotton, corn and soybean, they are characterized by the need for intensive cultivation. Specialty crops growers currently face serious labor cost and availability problems, and few technological solutions exist to increase their efficiency given the past history of abundant supply of low-cost labor.

Subtle disturbances such as drought, disease, insect activity, and <b>thinning</b> <b>harvests</b> {{have a significant impact}} on carbon budgeting and forest productivity, but current change detection algorithms struggle to accurately identify them, especially over decadal timeframes. We introduce an algorithm called Edyn, which inputs a time series of residuals from harmonic regression into a control chart to signal low-magnitude, consistent deviations from the curve as disturbances. After signaling, Edyn retrains a new baseline curve. We compared Edyn with its parent algorithm (EWMACD—Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Change Detection) on over 3500 visually interpreted Landsat pixels from across the contiguous USA, with reference data for timing and type of disturbance. For disturbed forested pixels, Edyn had a mean per-pixel commission error of 31. 1 % and omission error of 70. 0 %, while commission and omission errors for EWMACD were 39. 9 % and 65. 2 %, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. The {{economies of}} scale enable large farming {{operations}} to adopt GPS guidance technologies with sub-inch accuracy capabilities for multiple pass operations. For small to intermediate-size vegetable growers, precision guidance technologies are usually considered too expensive and are rarely utilized. A low-cost mechanical guidance system could be particularly beneficial for smaller-scale vegetable farms with limited labor pools because it can free up the driver for other operations requiring manual input such as transplanting, <b>thinning,</b> <b>harvesting,</b> etc. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a mechanical furrow-following system suitable for smaller-scale vegetable production and to assess its accuracy over multiple passes to determine whether it could achieve accuracy and precision similar to that of much more expensive GPS guidance systems. To assess the accuracy of the system, a GPS receiver was mounted on the frame of an existing wide-stance three-wheeled machine to precisely record machine position as it was used to carry out work on fixed beds. Guidance furrows were created by the narrow front wheels of the machine when it was initially manually driven in freshly-tilled soil. GPS data from the initial pass on each row was recorded and used as a baseline that all subsequent passes were compared to. Results show that it is possible to achieve high levels of accuracy (1. 3 in.

Farmworkers, who are primarily responsible for <b>thinning,</b> <b>harvesting,</b> and other agricultural work, are often exposed to these pesticides and take home pesticide residues on their clothing, shoes, and skin, potentially exposing children in the household to pesticides. We designed a project to reduce children’s exposure by using a community organization model. To better understand the community views regarding pesticide exposure, we conducted a qualitative community analysis. Two methods of data gathering were used to collect information. Individual interviews were conducted with some respondents, and small group discussions were held with others. Analysis indicated wide disparity among involved groups in their views on pesticides; however, a number of themes common to the majority of the constituents were identified and discussed with a community planning group. Because of the contention around pesticides, the group recommended every constituent participate in decision making. The group noted it was important to emphasize that the research project could provide scientific information on pesticide exposure to everyone in the Lower Yakima Valley.

Two silvicultural treatments (single tree selection and shelterwood strips) were applied to reduce basal area to different levels.

Time in motion data was collected on all system components to understand how the extra efforts to gather small diameter and slash material affect the cost structure of a mechanized timber <b>harvest</b> <b>thinning.</b> A sensitivity analysis was conducted to find breakeven points at varying diesel input costs, equipment purchase costs, hauling distances, stumpage costs and government subsidy. Results indicate that an average of 15. 50 tons of fuel chips and 35. 72 tons of solid hardwood products was removed per acre. The cost per ton to harvest, skid and process at road side for the fuel chips and solid hardwood products was $ 19. 20 and $ 11. 17 per ton respectively. Contracted fuel chips hauling cost was $ 12. 00 per ton and solid hardwood hauling averaged $ 4. 16 per ton. Stumpage was assumed to be $ 5. 00 and $ 9. 95 per ton, respectively.

40|$|Australia {{is heavily}} reliant on fossil fuels, {{particularly}} coal, for electricity production, {{but is now}} encouraging expansion of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Plantation forests are a potential source of biomass for renewable bioenergy. This study examines the potential GHG emission reduction from bioenergy utilising <b>thinning,</b> <b>harvest</b> and sawmill residues from plantation forests in northern NSW. Using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach, two alternative energy conversion options were compared: co-firing in black coal power plants located distant from the plantation region, or in stand-alone wood-fired plants located within the plantation region. Emission reduction per ha, and per unit electricity produced were calculated for two levels of plantation productivity. The potential emission reduction from forestry in Northern NSW was estimated using published predictions of future expansion of plantations in this region. Co-firing gave higher emissions reduction per ha, and per unit of biomass, due to the greater efficiency of energy conversion by co-firing. However, co-firing gave lower emissions reduction per MWh, compared with the wood-fired option, due to the greater fossil fuel input required for transport. The emission reduction benefits of the wood-fired plants would increase, and possibly surpass the co-fired option, if high efficiency IGCC technology was employed. The potential biomass production from 180 000 ha plantations in northern NSW {{was estimated to be}} 2. 03 Mt dry matter per annum.
