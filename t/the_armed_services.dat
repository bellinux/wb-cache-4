5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new Congress in 1977, Mathias was in line for several potential committee promotions to ranking member. However, Mathias' outspoken criticism of the party in the previous election cycle aroused enmity amongst his colleagues. On the Judiciary Committee, Mathias had the most seniority of any other member except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another ranking membership on <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> Committee. Only one ranking membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his ranking membership on <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> Committee to circumvent Mathias serving as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions on the Government Operations Committee following a power struggle, and on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. On the latter subcommittee, Mathias had more seniority than any other member. However, party leaders were uneasy with the idea of allowing Mathias to team up with liberal Democrat and subcommittee chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L. Scott as ranking member.|$|E

5|$|The armed forces' third arm, the Liberian National Coast Guard, was {{established}} in 1959. Throughout the Tubman period the coastguard {{was little more than}} a few sometimes unserviceable patrol craft manned by ill-trained personnel, though its training improved in the 1980s to the point where it was considered the best trained of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
5|$|During 1947 Katsura {{caught the}} eye of American {{serviceman}} Vernon Greenleaf (no relation to the pool and carom billiards champion Ralph Greenleaf), a master sergeant in the U.S. Army's Quartermaster Corps who had been in <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>services</b> for 22 years.

5|$|During {{the first}} decades of the 20th century, the Australian Government {{established}} <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>services</b> as separate organisations. Each service had an independent chain of command. In 1976, the government made a strategic change and established the ADF to place the services under a single headquarters. Over time, the degree of integration has increased and tri-service headquarters, logistics and training institutions have supplanted many single-service establishments.|$|E

5|$|Within the United States armed forces, {{according}} to an unscientific survey, the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections. While 73percent of military personnel {{said that they would}} vote for Bush, 18percent preferred his Democratic rival, John Kerry. According to Peter Feaver, a Duke University political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the U.S. military, members of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>services</b> supported Bush because they found him more likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's most {{immediate}} issue as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense budget. Cheney deemed it appropriate {{to cut the}} budget and downsize the military, following the Reagan Administration's peacetime defense buildup {{at the height of}} the Cold War. As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>services</b> for such expensive programs as the Avenger II Naval attack aircraft, the B-2 stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-wing helicopter, the Aegis destroyer and the MX missile, totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed world politics. Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting.|$|E
5|$|He criticised the {{hypocrisy}} of chastity for women and argued that it should also either belong to men, {{or not at all}} for both individuals. While fighting against this, Periyar advocated {{to get rid of the}} Devadasi system. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. As a further liberation of women, Periyar pushed for the right of women to have an education and to join <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>services</b> and the police force.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's team {{arrived in}} Australia {{towards the end}} of 1945, but <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>services</b> and Australian Board of Control ordered them to play another series against the various Australian states. Johnson had sought {{fixtures}} for his team in Australia, but this was before the Evatt had added the matches in the subcontinent. He implored the administrators to recognise that the players were already overworked, but was ignored. The Services performed poorly; after playing out consecutive draws against Western Australia and South Australia, they were crushed by an innings by both Victoria and New South Wales, before drawing against Queensland and Tasmania, the smallest state in the country.|$|E
5|$|Michael Woodruff {{was born}} on 3 April 1911 in Mill Hill, London, England. In 1913, his father, Harold Woodruff, a {{professor}} of veterinary medicine at the Royal Veterinary College in London, moved the family to Australia so he could take up the post of Professor of Veterinary Pathology and Director of the Veterinary Institute at the University of Melbourne. The elder Woodruff later became the Professor of Bacteriology. The family's new life in Australia was interrupted by World War I, which prompted Harold to enlist in <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>services.</b> He became {{an officer in the}} Australian Army Veterinary Corps and was sent to Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCain {{became a}} member of <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> Committee, with which he had {{formerly}} done his Navy liaison work; he also joined the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee.

5|$|Sverdrup {{enlisted in}} the US Army at Fort Snelling, Minnesota on 26 July 1918. He was posted to Camp Devens, Massachusetts for {{training}} with the 36th Division. While there he took advantage of a regulation waiving the normal five-year residency requirement for members of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>services</b> seeking to take out US citizenship. Sverdrup formally took the oath as a citizen in Boston on 30 September 1918. The US Army then {{sent him to the}} Field Artillery's Officer Training Center at Camp Zachary Taylor, near Louisville, Kentucky, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 18 January 1919. The war having ended, Sverdrup was immediately placed in the inactive reserves. He was honorably discharged after nominally serving two five-year terms on 17 January 1929.|$|E
5|$|When a {{temporary}} Air Board {{was set up}} to examine the feasibility of an Australian Air Force (AAF), Goble was assigned as a Navy representative, with Lieutenant Colonel Richard Williams, an Australian Flying Corps veteran of World War I, acting as an Army spokesman. The permanent Australian Air Board was established on 9 November 1920, and recommended creation of the AAF as an independent branch of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>services.</b> The AAF came into being on 31 March 1921—the 'Royal' prefix being granted five months later—and Goble resigned his commission in the RAF the same day to transfer to the new service as a wing commander.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, a few on Capitol Hill were {{determined}} to overhaul United States Special Operations Forces. They included Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and William Cohen (R-ME), both members of <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> Committee, and Representative Dan Daniel (D-VA), {{the chairman of the}} United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment was not interested in special operations, that the country's capability in this area was second rate, and that SOF operational command and control was an endemic problem. Senators Nunn and Cohen also felt strongly that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational focus and chain of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.|$|E
