Sebold was told to retain two of the microphotographs and to deliver the other three to German operatives in the United States: Fritz Joubert Duquesne, Hermann Lang, and one other. After receiving final instructions, including using the assumed name Harry Sawyer, he sailed from Genoa, Italy, and arrived in New York City on February 8, 1940.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{hearing aids}} include {{wireless}} hearing aids. One hearing aid can <b>transmit</b> <b>to</b> {{the other side}} so that pressing one aid's program button simultaneously changes the other aid, so that both aids change background settings simultaneously. FM listening systems are now emerging with wireless receivers integrated {{with the use of}} hearing aids. A separate wireless microphone can be given to a partner to wear in a restaurant, in the car, during leisure time, in the shopping mall, at lectures, or during religious services. The voice is transmitted wirelessly to the hearing aids eliminating the effects of distance and background noise. FM systems have shown to give the best speech understanding in noise of all available technologies.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{ventricle}} is inadequately emptied, ventricular end-diastolic {{pressure and}} volumes increase. This is <b>transmitted</b> <b>to</b> the atrium. On {{the left side}} of the heart, the increased pressure is <b>transmitted</b> <b>to</b> the pulmonary vasculature, and the resultant hydrostatic pressure favors extravasation of fluid into the lung parenchyma, causing pulmonary edema. On the right side of the heart, the increased pressure is <b>transmitted</b> <b>to</b> the systemic venous circulation and systemic capillary beds, favoring extravasation of fluid into the tissues of target organs and extremities, resulting in dependent peripheral edema.|$|R

25|$|The program debuted on ABC-TV on January 22, 1955, but {{the first}} 14 {{national}} telecasts were staged at KOMU-TV in Columbia, Missouri because network television transmission capability from Springfield was not available. Columbia had a microwave transmitter, however, for ABC coverage of University of Missouri football games. After AT installed a microwave link in Springfield to <b>transmit</b> <b>to</b> Kansas City (which could feed to the network via Chicago), and modifications {{were made to the}} Jewell (including extending the stage and adding a control room), the program returned to the theater with the first broadcast April 30. The show was sent to KYTV by a local microwave link from the station's remote van. Rehearsals for Saturday shows were held on Fridays, with run-throughs Saturday afternoons.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Meehan {{introduced}} a bill called the Critical Infrastructure Research and Development Advancement Act of 2013 (H.R. 2952; 113th Congress). If signed into law, the bill would require more oversight of the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity goals, according to Ripon Advance. The bill would require DHS to <b>transmit</b> <b>to</b> the Congress a strategic plan {{for research and development}} efforts addressing the protection of critical infrastructure and a report on departmental use of public-private consortiums to develop technology to protect such infrastructure. On January 16, 2014, the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies passed the bill, and in February the full Homeland Security Committee approved the bill. On July 28, 2014, the House voted to pass the bill in a voice vote.|$|E
25|$|Lovell {{continued}} {{his work on}} the production antenna design using klystrons and wrapped up this work on 22 July. The team then began adapting the various bits of equipment to work together as a single radar unit based on the magnetron. J. R. Atkinson and W. E. Burcham, both sent to the AIS team from the Cavendish Laboratory at University of Cambridge, produced a pulsed power source, and Skinner and A. G. Ward, also from Cavendish, worked on a receiver. At the time the team had no solution to switching the antenna from <b>transmit</b> <b>to</b> receive, so they initially used two antennas side-by-side, one on the transmitter and one on the receiver. On 8 August they were experimenting with this setup when they received a signal from a nearby fishing hut. With the antenna still pointed in the same direction, they accidentally detected an aircraft which flew by the site at 6pm on 12 August. The next day, Dee, Watt and Rowe were on hand, but with no convenient aircraft available the team instead demonstrated the system by detecting the returns from a tin sheet being held by someone bicycling across a nearby cliff. With this demonstration of the radar's ability to reject ground returns and detect targets at basically zero altitude, interest in the 1.5m systems began to wane.|$|E
