40|$|One of {{the most}} {{characteristic}} features of the Finnish Companies Act 21. 7. 2006 / 624 (hereinafter the FCA) is the system of so-called true non-par value shares. The Finnish true non-par value system offers companies the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>allot</b> <b>shares</b> completely free of charge even in a directed share issue, i. e. when the pre-emptive rights of the existing shareholders are derogated. This opportunity could be risky, especially {{from the viewpoint of}} the minority shareholders, if the required majority of shareholders could in a shareholders meeting freely adopt a resolution about that kind of share issue. In practice, this would mean that a part of the share of the assets and of the power in the company of the old shareholders could be transferred to the new shareholders. However, the use of the directed share issue without payment is restricted by certain material grounds defined in the FCA. Pursuant to chapter 9 section 4 subsection 1 of the FCA, a directed share issue without payment is allowed only if there is an especially weighty reason both for the company and in regard to the interests of all shareholders in the company. The aim of this research is to formulate a meaningful interpretation of the wording of chapter 9 section 4 subsection 1 of the FCA, which {{could be used as a}} test when it must be judged, is there an especially weighty reason for the same both for the company and in regard to the interests of all shareholders in the company. My main thesis proposes that besides the formal or judicial principle of equality between shareholders, the principle of equality in its entirety, as it is known in Finnish company law, also has an economic dimension, which can be referred to as the principle of economic equality between shareholders. As such, a directed share issue without payment always means a breach against the equality of shareholders in the formal sense. However, if the company acquires enough substantial economic benefits through that kind of share issue, the real financial position and value of shareholdings of even those shareholders, who are not entitled to the shares allotted without charge, might remain untouched or even improve. The economic equality of shareholders could then be the core of the material grounds of the directed share issue without consideration. This thesis is divided into six chapters. Chapter 1 describes the objects and hypotheses of the research, its methods, the most important sources and its structure. Chapters 2 and 3 are the theoretical or general part of the research. The former contains discussion about historical and modern corporate law theories, the concept of a share in a company limited by shares and the relevance of the investment made to a company s capital against the shares. The latter deals with the principle of equality between shareholders and the different dimensions of that principle. Chapters 4 and 5 constitute the practical part of the research. The former provides detailed presentation of the directed share issue without payment as a process. The latter focuses to the interpretation of the especially weighty reason for the same both for the company and in regard to the interests of all shareholders in the company and provides examples about acceptable grounds to the directed share issue without payment. Finally, chapter 6 summarizes the theses and conclusions of the research. The main conclusions of this research are that Finnish company law contains a principle of the economic equality of shareholders as a mandatory rule, and this rule is based on the economic purpose of business companies and the material objectives of the equality principle in company law. The residual position of shareholders in a business company is still based on a contribution to the company. However, even an indirect improvement of the financial position of the company as a result of a directed share issue without payment can be considered as the equivalent of a contribution, i. e. the directed share issue without payment should not be, in effect, a share issue without payment as it would be understood in everyday language. The principle of economic equality also gives a meaningful bedrock to the interpretation of chapter 9 section 4 subsection 1 of the FCA. This principle can then be considered a distinctive feature between the material grounds of the normal directed share issue against payment and the directed share issue without payment. In the former type of directed share issue, the adequate issue price plays a central role and fulfils the objective of economic equality. In the directed share issue without payment other kinds of benefits to the company and the evaluation of economic equality against those benefits will have an independent role. A directed share issue without payment must always be in the interests of the company, the benefit it provides to the company must be substantial and of an economic nature, and it must be defendable when compared to the interests of all shareholders of the company. This latter part of the material grounds of the directed share issue without payment must be interpreted as an example of the mandatory principle of economic equality between shareholders. The essential meaning of that principle in the directed share issue without payment is that the dilution of formal shareholder rights of old shareholders must be compensated in economic sense through the enhanced financial position of the company as a whole. The evaluation of such an expected compensation must, however, be made at the time of the share issue resolution, not retrospectively. Tutkimuksen aiheena on suunnattu maksuton osakeanti ja sen aineellisen perusteen osakeyhtiölain (624 / 2006) 9 luvun 4 §:n 1 momentissa tarkoitettu yhtiön kannalta ja sen kaikkien osakkeenomistajien etu huomioon ottaen erityisen painava taloudellinen syy tulkinta. Suunnatun maksuttoman osakeannin mekanismina mahdollistaa osakeyhtiölaissa omaksuttu nimellisarvoton osakeyhtiön pääomajärjestelmä, jossa osakkeiden antaminen ei edellytä osakepääoman korottamista. Sellaisenaan suunnattu maksuton anti näyttää osakkeenomistajien yhdenvertaisuuden kannalta ongelmalliselta menettelyltä: annin ulkopuolelle jäävien osakkeenomistajien suhteellinen osuus yhtiössä supistuu, eikä yhtiöön välittömästi tule uusia varoja. Keskeisenä väitteenä tutkimuksessa on, että yhdenvertaisuudella osakeyhtiössä on taloudellinen ulottuvuus, jonka turvaaminen on myös osa suunnatun maksuttoman annin aineellista perustetta. Osakkeenomistajien taloudellinen yhdenvertaisuus toteutuu, kun annista seuraavan yhtiön taloudellisen aseman parantumisen voidaan perustellusti odottaa korvaavan annin ulkopuolelle jäävien osakkeenomistajien suhteellisen yhtiöosuuden laimenemisen. Vaatimus yhtiön taloudellisen aseman paranemisesta tai kääntäen yhtiön taloudellisen aseman heikkenemisen torjumisesta merkitsee, että annin maksuttomuuden on oltava näennäistä. Taloudellinen yhdenvertaisuus periaatteena antaa mielekkään sisällön suunnatun maksuttoman annin perusteeseen sisältyvälle kaikkien osakkeenomistajien edun huomioon ottamisen vaatimukselle. Suunnatun maksuttoman annin perusteen tulkinta taustoitetaan tutkimuksessa käsittelemällä osakeyhtiötä koskevia teorioita viimeisen sadan vuoden ajalta, osakeyhtiön oikeushenkilöyttä, osakkeen käsitesisältöä, osakkeen maksullisuuden ja nimellisarvon merkitystä, osakeyhtiöoikeudellisen yhdenvertaisuusperiaatteen eri ulottuvuuksia sekä yhtiön edun sisältöä ja merkitystä. Suunnatun maksuttoman annin aineellisesta perusteesta hahmotetaan testi, jota vasten menettelyn sallittavuutta eri käytännön tilanteissa voidaan arvioida. Tutkimukseen on otettu myös yksityiskohtainen esitys suunnatun maksuttoman annin järjestämistä koskevasta menettelystä sekä systemaattinen kuvaus erilaisista mahdollisista suunnatun maksuttoman annin käyttötilanteista...|$|E
50|$|The Mahtani parties {{applied to}} the Commercial Court in the British Virgin Islands for {{permission}} to serve Mr Varma out of the jurisdiction. Bannister J initially refused permission to serve out of the jurisdiction {{because there was no}} real issue to be tried between the Mahtani parties on their rectification claim, since the Mahtani parties were not shareholders in Nilon and there was no allegation that Nilon itself had ever agreed <b>to</b> <b>allot</b> any <b>shares</b> <b>to</b> them. He further struck out the claim against Nilon for largely the same reasons. The Mahtani parties appealed against both points. The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court Court of Appeal allowed the appeals by the Mahtani parties and decided that there was an arguable claim against Nilon, and that was a claim to which Mr Varma was a necessary and proper party.|$|R
