When {{he found the}} wigs too full he untied one hair {{at a time to}} alter their shape. Kane's mustache was inserted into <b>the</b> <b>makeup</b> surface a few hairs at a time, to realistically vary the color and texture.|$|E
5000|$|For I Am Legend, {{starring}} Will Smith Mark Rappaport developed {{full body}} silicone <b>makeups</b> for <b>the</b> primal, aggressive beings known as [...] "Darkseekers". <b>The</b> translucent <b>makeup</b> creates <b>the</b> look of zombie infection and a spiked metabolism desired by director Francis Lawrence. <b>The</b> <b>makeups</b> {{were to be}} applied to very thin performers to create the look of zero body-fat and protruding veins. <b>The</b> <b>makeups</b> included rotten teeth dentures and fully dilated pupil contact lenses. In addition to <b>the</b> creature <b>makeups,</b> Mark's studio created animatronic puppets of the likeness of [...] "Sam" [...] the German Shepherd, a digitally scan model for the infected dogs, scar and knife wound moulage for Will Smith and numerous other effects for the production.|$|R

5|$|The work {{of makeup}} artist Phil Leakey in {{transforming}} Richard Wordsworth's Carroon into the mutating creature {{was a key}} contribution {{to the effectiveness of}} the film. Val Guest, Anthony Hinds and Leakey all agreed that <b>the</b> <b>makeup</b> should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly. Leakey placed a light above the actor in <b>the</b> <b>makeup</b> chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by his eyebrows, nose, chin and cheekbones. <b>The</b> <b>makeup</b> was a liquid rubber solution mixed with glycerine to give the impression of sweat. Leakey's job was made easier by Wordsworth's natural high cheekbones and hollow temples and he also worked closely with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth's features. Leakey also created Carroon's mutating arm. The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an arthritis victim, enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey. The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and, inside, had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling. A large sponge-rubber prosthetic was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon's mutation had advanced further. The shrivelled corpses of Carroon's victims, glimpsed {{from time to time in}} the film, were also made by Leakey.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{recalled}} The Original Series, {{and said}} that she was pleased to be remembered as an Orion slave girl. However, she was not pleased with the make-up process which took between four and five hours to apply, and required each actress to be sprayed with green make-up over their whole body. Removal of <b>the</b> <b>makeup</b> was via the showers in the Paramount lot's executive gym. The make-up team also needed to apply fake sweat and bruises to other members of the cast to represent the results of the increased aggression shown by them in the episode's plot.|$|E

5|$|Barney Burman {{supervised}} <b>the</b> <b>makeup</b> for {{the other}} aliens: his team had to rush the creation {{of many of the}} aliens, because originally the majority of them were to feature in one scene towards the end of filming. Abrams deemed the scene too similar to the cantina sequence in Star Wars and decided to dot the designs around the film. A tribble was placed in the background of Scotty's introduction. Both digital and physical makeup was used for aliens.|$|E
5|$|Day-Lewis played Abraham Lincoln in Steven Spielberg's film Lincoln (2012). Based on {{the book}} , the film began {{shooting}} in Richmond, Virginia in October 2011.

He read over 100 books on Lincoln, and long worked with <b>the</b> <b>makeup</b> artist to achieve a physical likeness to Lincoln. Lincoln received widespread critical acclaim, much of it directed to Day-Lewis's performance. It also became a commercial success, grossing over $275 million worldwide. In November 2012, Day-Lewis received the BAFTA Britannia Award for Excellence in Film.|$|E

5|$|In 1809, <b>the</b> <b>makeup</b> of the {{legislature}} was altered again by Congress to a bicameral body. A House of Representatives was created and the representation was apportioned by population.

Thereafter, the structure {{of the legislature}} remained unchanged {{for the remainder of the}} territory's existence.|$|E
5|$|Later, Allison {{acquired}} a 2 MeV Van de Graaff generator, and he recalled an old paper on producing lithium ions from minerals like Eucryptite. This {{allowed him to}} produce a 1.2 MeV lithium ion beam. He created hitherto unknown isotopes of boron and other light elements, and measured their neutron capture cross sections. A side effect of this work was a method to analyze surface materials where chemical analysis was unavailable. His colleague Anthony L. Turkevich subsequently used this to analyze <b>the</b> <b>makeup</b> of the Moon on the later Surveyor program missions. Allison continued to take on Ph.D. candidates, some of whom, such as James Cronin went on to distinguished careers.|$|E
5|$|Olivier {{researched}} the role by traveling to Norfolk, Virginia {{to visit the}} MacArthur Museum, and speaking with Alexander Haig, who had served as aide-de-camp to MacArthur. Haig told Olivier that MacArthur's voice sounded like W. C. Fields, and Olivier tried to imitate this. He enjoyed working with accents, and obtained recordings of MacArthur's voice. He was interested in various inconsistencies in these recordings, {{and especially in the}} difference in vowel sounds made by MacArthur. During filming, <b>the</b> <b>makeup</b> process for Olivier took two and a half hours, but after it was complete, he thought he neither looked like himself nor like General MacArthur.|$|E

5|$|The album's working {{title was}} {{originally}} announced as Magic's in <b>the</b> <b>Makeup</b> in May 1998 {{and later as}} Saturn Returns in November 1999. Stefani was confused by her feelings of depression and interest in Sylvia Plath while recording the album. Her boyfriend Gavin Rossdale {{told her that she}} was going through her Saturn return. Saturn's orbit takes 29.4 Earth years and, in astrology, the time when Saturn returns to its position during a person's birth is believed to be a period of self-evaluation. Stefani was born October 3, 1969, and many of the songs were written during her Saturn return.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} {{originally}} formed in 1913 by local businessmen, who built a wooden clubhouse at 33 Queen's Road which opened on 2 December {{of the same}} year. After falling into disrepair, this wooden structure {{was replaced by the}} present brick building in 1978, with the club officially reopening on 7 December. The Clark family took on the club's license in 1992 and began to put on gigs after a shift in <b>the</b> <b>makeup</b> of Hyde Park's population caused by more students moving into the area. Initial shows were focused around the local DIY music scene.|$|E
5|$|Caglione and Drexler were {{recommended}} for <b>the</b> prosthetic <b>makeup</b> designs by Canonero, {{with whom they}} had worked on The Cotton Club (1984). <b>The</b> rogues gallery <b>makeup</b> designs were directly taken from Gould's drawings, {{with the exception of}} Al Pacino (Big Boy Caprice), who improvised his own designs, ignoring the rather overweight character of <b>the</b> strip. His <b>makeup</b> took 3.5 hours to apply.|$|R
50|$|Most toxicants {{are known}} to affect only a {{fraction}} of exposed population.

50|$|<b>The</b> {{partisan}} <b>makeup</b> of each {{committee is}} intended to reflect {{as closely as possible}} <b>the</b> partisan <b>makeup</b> of <b>the</b> entire House.

5|$|The {{film was}} commercially successful, but it {{received}} largely negative reviews, although even critical reviews complimented Baker's makeup effects. According to writer/director Sachs, many scenes that were re-shot and {{changed by the}} producers proved problematic due to their inferior acting. The Incredible Melting Man was featured in the comedy It Came from Hollywood (1982) and inspired <b>the</b> <b>makeup</b> effects for a scene in the science fiction-action film RoboCop (1987). It was also featured in a season 7 episode of the comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{also can}} influence the state court system through the appointment of judges. In Indiana, when vacancies occur on the Supreme Court, Tax Court, and circuit courts, the Judicial Nominating Commission interviews candidates and sends a list of three candidates for each vacancy to the governor, who chooses one. Justices of the peace and superior courts judges are elected in Indiana; if a vacancy occurs (such as by death or resignation) the governor may make an appointment, who holds the office until the next general election. The authority to make such appointments gives the governor considerable sway in setting <b>the</b> <b>makeup</b> of the judiciary.|$|E
5|$|The unity {{government}} suffered a partial collapse in 1995. The continuing violence, along with appointing {{of local government}} officials who were almost exclusively RPF Tutsi, caused serious disagreement between Kagame and senior Hutu government members, including prime minister Faustin Twagiramungu and interior minister Seth Sendashonga. Twagiramungu resigned in August, and Kagame fired Sendashonga and three others the next day. Pasteur Bizimungu remained president but <b>the</b> <b>makeup</b> {{of the new government}} was predominantly RPF Tutsi loyal to Kagame. Twagiramungu and Sendashonga moved abroad to form a new opposition party shortly after leaving the government.|$|E
