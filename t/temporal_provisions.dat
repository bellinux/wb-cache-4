To the simple wonder {{of the majority of}} early worshipers--the half-breed converts who rigorously attended the spiritual ministrations of the Mission, and ate the <b>temporal</b> <b>provisions</b> of the reverend fathers--he deputed the functions of the first mass to a coadjutor, and, breviary in hand, sought the orchard of venerable pear trees. Whether there was any occult sympathy in his reflections with the contemplation of their gnarled, twisted, gouty, and knotty limbs, still bearing gracious and goodly fruit, I know not, but it was his private retreat, and under one of the most rheumatic and misshapen trunks there was a rude seat. Here Father Pedro sank, his face toward the mountain wall between him and the invisible sea. The relentless, dry, practical Californian sunlight falling on his face grimly pointed out a night of vigil and suffering. The snuffy yellow of his eyes was injected yet burning, his temples were ridged and veined like a tobacco leaf; the odor of desiccation which his garments always exhaled was hot and feverish, as if the fire had suddenly awakened among the ashes.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the classic}} methods to improve the noise {{immunity}} of passive detection of infrared wavelength range (IKSO) is a differential inclusion of pyrocatechol, placed at some distance. An analytical model of a differential method of receiving infrared radiation from moving objects is introduced. A comparison with experimental results for moving objects of different types is made. Differential inclusion of sensors can be used not only to compensate the external interference, but also to determine the boundaries of a temporary "slot", inside which the movable object {{is most likely to}} be detected. The temporal boundaries are used for the decision making about the type and parameters of the movable object in complexional device of object classification. The principle of operation of ikso, which is to record signals with diversity of pyrocatechol into the appropriate memory registers and output detection of the differential signal envelope. Subsequently, from the memory registers portions of a recording signal posted pyrocatechol are selected which are later processed to determine the <b>temporal</b> <b>provisions</b> of minimum minimore and maximum maximore. The direction of movement of the object abeam is determined by the delay or advance of the extrema of the signals of one sensor relative to another within a given temporal "slot". It is shown that aggregation should be the following – the tool with a maximum radius of the zone of sensitivity should be active and the basic, but if there is a more reliable piece of information about the detected object which can implement a more refined classification of the object (for example, a group of people, wheeled vehicles-tracked vehicles, etc.). The conclusion is made about the advantages of differential option to include spaced sensors. The results can be used in the development of infrared wavelengths passive detection in the conceptual design phase. </p...|$|E

This paper considers the challenges of supporting economically efficient allocation of wildfire suppression resources in a social cost-benefit analysis framework when non-market values are important. These challenges include substantial gaps in scientific understanding about how the spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>provision</b> of non-market values are affected by wildfire, the limited utility of benefit transfer in wildfire assessment, a lack of studies that have estimated marginal willingness-to-pay to conserve non-market values, violation of consumer budget constraints, and the infeasibility of valuing indigenous cultural heritage.

30|$|Generally, staging models {{imply that}} {{natural history of}} the {{disorder}} moves through a predictable <b>temporal</b> progression, and <b>provision</b> of stage-appropriate treatment can modify such course. Some medical specialties such as cardiology and oncology have advanced in this field, developing strategies to prevent both the onset {{and the development of}} established disease. In the same way, bipolar disorder identified in the early stages may be less treatment refractory with a greater probability of response to monotherapy (Scott et al. 2006; Swann et al. 1999). Therefore, the contribution of developmental staging is really important since it provides the opportunity to intervene therapeutically in premorbid patients with bipolar disorder thus preventing a more pernicious course of illness.|$|R
5000|$|The {{real-time}} scheduler {{developed in}} the context of the IRMOS European Project is a multi-processor real-time scheduler for the Linux kernel, particularly suitable for <b>temporal</b> isolation and <b>provisioning</b> of QoS guarantees to complex multi-threaded software components and also entire virtual machines. For example, when using Linux as host OS and KVM as hypervisor, IRMOS can be used to provide scheduling guarantees to indidivual VMs and at the same time isolate their performance so as to avoid undesired temporal interferences. IRMOS features a combined EDF/FP hierarchical scheduler. At the outer level there is a partitioned EDF scheduler on the available CPUs. However, reservations are multi-CPU, and global FP over multi-processors is used at the inner level in order to schedule the threads (and/or processes) attached to each outer EDF reservation.

40|$|Abstract. Concerns {{regarding}} the scalability of the inter-domain rout-ing have encouraged researchers to start elaborating a more robust In-ternet architecture. While {{consensus on the}} exact form of the solution {{is yet to be}} found, the need for a semantic decoupling of a node’s loca-tion and identity is generally accepted as the only way forward. One of the most successful proposals to follow this guideline is LISP (Loc/ID Separation Protocol). Design wise, its aim is to insulate the Internet’s core routing state from the dynamics of edge networks. However, this requires the introduction of a mapping system, a distributed database, that should provide the binding of the two resulting namespaces. In or-der to avoid frequent lookups and not to penalize the speed of packet forwarding, map-caches that store <b>temporal</b> bindings are <b>provisioned</b> in routers. In this paper, we rely on the working-set theory to build a model that accurately predicts a map-cache’s performance for traffic with time translation invariance of the working-set size.

40|$|Many {{vertebrate}} species {{alter their}} reproductive behavior under stressful conditions. Available evidence in wild birds suggests that under food limitation, parents reduce overall provisioning rate while increasing selectivity of food distribution within brood {{in favor of}} senior siblings. However, how acute stressors such as predation risk influence the magnitude and direction of changes in parental provisioning is poorly understood. In this study, a small passerine bird, the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca), {{was used as a}} model species to investigate parental provisioning strategies when exposed to different types of predators. Parents reduced provisioning rates remarkably when exposed to a predator of adults, whereas no behavioral change was observed when nest predation was imitated. Under normal conditions, parents preferred senior chicks to juniors. In contrast to experiments with food limitation, parents allocated food equally to senior and junior siblings under predation risk, irrespective of the type of a predator. No sex-related differences in parental provisioning strategies were found. We conclude that parents alter several aspects of their behavior in response to fear stress. If danger to parents occurs repeatedly, <b>temporal</b> reductions in <b>provisioning</b> rates may have cumulative and potentially harmful consequences on offspring performance.

40|$|AbstractAs {{more and}} more real time spatio-temporal {{datasets}} become available at increasing spatial and <b>temporal</b> resolutions, the <b>provision</b> of high quality, predictive information about spatio-temporal processes becomes an increasingly feasible goal. However, many sensor networks that collect spatio-temporal information are prone to failure, resulting in missing data. To complicate matters, the missing data is often not missing at random, and is characterised by long periods where no data is observed. The performance of traditional univariate forecasting methods such as ARIMA models decreases with {{the length of the}} missing data period because they {{do not have access to}} local temporal information. However, if spatio-temporal autocorrelation is present in a space–time series then spatio-temporal approaches have the potential to offer better forecasts. In this paper, a non-parametric spatio-temporal kernel regression model is developed to forecast the future unit journey time values of road links in central London, UK, under the assumption of sensor malfunction. Only the current traffic patterns of the upstream and downstream neighbouring links are used to inform the forecasts. The model performance is compared with another form of non-parametric regression, K-nearest neighbours, which is also effective in forecasting under missing data. The methods show promising forecasting performance, particularly in periods of high congestion...|$|R

40|$|Water is {{essential}} for agriculture including livestock. Given increasing global concern that access to agricultural water will constrain food production and that livestock production uses and degrades too much water, there is compelling need for {{better understanding of the}} nature of livestock–water interactions. Inappropriate animal management along with poor cropping practices often contributes to widespread and severe depletion, degradation and contamination of water. In developed countries, diverse environmental organisations increasingly voice concerns that animal production is a major cause of land and water degradation. Thus, they call for reduced animal production. Such views generally fail to consider their context, applicability and implications for developing countries. Two global research programs, the CGIAR ‘Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management and Agriculture’ and ‘Challenge Program on Water and Food’ have undertaken studies of the development, management and conservation of agricultural water in developing countries. Drawing on these programs, this paper describes a framework to systematically identify key livestock–water interactions and suggests strategies for improving livestock and water management especially in the mixed crop–livestock production systems of sub-Saharan Africa. In contrast to developed country experience, this research suggests that currently livestock water productivity compares favourably with crop water productivity in Africa. Yet, great opportunities remain to further reduce domestic animals’ use of water in the continent. Integrating livestock and water planning, development and management has the potential to help reduce poverty, increase food production and reduce pressure on the environment including scarce water resources. Four strategies involving technology, policy and institutional interventions can help achieve this. They are choosing feeds that require relatively little water, conserving water resources through better animal and land management, applying well known tools from the animal sciences to increase animal production, and strategic <b>temporal</b> and spatial <b>provisioning</b> of drinking water. Achieving integrated livestock–water development will require new ways of thinking about, and managing, water by water- and animal-science professionals...|$|R
