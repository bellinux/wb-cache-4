25|$|Many {{adventure}} games {{make use}} of an inventory management screen as a distinct gameplay mode. Players are only able <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> objects in the game, so the player usually knows that only objects that can be picked up are important. Because {{it can be difficult}} for a player to know if they missed an important item, they will often scour every scene for items. For games that utilize a point and click device, players will sometimes engage in a systematic search known as a pixel hunt. Games try to avoid this by highlighting the item, or by snapping the player's cursor to the item.|$|E

25|$|When Toole {{was unable}} to resume his {{position}} at Dominican in January, the school had to hire another professor. This greatly upset his mother and on January 19, 1969 they had a horrible final argument. He stopped by the house the next day <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> things and spoke only to his father, as Thelma was out at the grocery store. He left home for the final time and withdrew $1500 from his saving account. After a week she called the police, but without any evidence to his whereabouts, they took a report and {{waited for him to}} surface. Thelma became convinced that Toole's friends the Rickels knew where he was and called them repeatedly, even though they denied knowing where he had gone.|$|E

500|$|Since late 2008, MOBA {{has been}} experimenting with {{allowing}} the public to title and caption some works. According to the curatorial staff, since some of the works are so puzzling, mere artistic interpretation is not sufficient: they must be [...] "interpreted". The [...] "Guest Interpretator's Collection" [...] is an invitation for MOBA's visitors to include their thoughts on compelling artworks; a contest decides the best analysis and one is added every two months. A professor at Boston University offered his thoughts: [...] "The location of the museum as much as its collection suggests {{a commitment to the}} abject and a belief in the power and force of culture's marginalized effects. I was also reminded that I need <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> toilet bowl cleaner on my way home!" ...|$|E
500|$|Coming at {{the tail}} end of the giallo cycle, Tenebrae does not appear to have been as {{influential}} as Argento's earlier films. Douglas E. Winter, however, has commented that Tenebraes Louma crane sequence has been stylistically influential, pointing to its use in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables (1987). In addition, towards the end of the film, with Neal supposedly dead, the camera faces Detective Giermani directly. When he stoops <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> evidence from the floor, Neal is revealed to be stood behind him, their silhouettes having perfectly matched in the shot. Alan Jones cited Tenebrae as the first film to use this specific type of camera blocking, and believes it to have been copied and referenced deliberately by later filmmakers. One such example, discussed as an unacknowledged [...] "steal" [...] from Tenebrae, is De Palma's [...] "surprise reveal" [...] of John Lithgow standing behind a victim in Raising Cain (1992). Robert Zemeckis's What Lies Beneath (2000) also contains a similar moment, although Zemeckis has denied a familiarity with Italian movies.|$|E
500|$|Film scholar Richard Dyer {{highlights}} several intelligent devices used by Argento in {{the editing}} of the film, noting that interpolated sequences are sometimes punctuated by [...] "shots of pills {{and the sound}} of running water." [...] Steffen Hantke believes that the shock cuts {{in the latter part of}} the film are among cinema's [...] "most brutal and stylized", and exhibit a degree of abstract expressionism. Film scholar Leon Hunt argues that the devices and themes utilized by Argento in the making of Tenebrae make it as much an example of art cinema as anything else. The initial murders are shot in a [...] "clipped montage style", which is later revealed to be reflecting the use of a camera by the first killer to record the scene. Giuliano Gemma later said that Argento fostered an improvisational atmosphere on set. One example he gave was the scene where his character bends <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> evidence from the floor, only to reveal Neal behind him having perfectly matched his position relative to the camera. This moment was not scripted, but resulted from Argento's noticing the actors' similar build while they were stood, one behind the other in front of him.|$|E

She is not reading but staring straight in front of her. She looks unhappy, troubled, frowningly concentrated on her thoughts. CHRIS wanders about the room, casting quick, uneasy side glances at her face, then stopping to peer absentmindedly out of the window. His attitude betrays an overwhelming, gloomy anxiety which has him on tenter hooks. He pretends {{to be engaged in}} setting things ship-shape, but this occupation is confined <b>to</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> object, staring at it stupidly for a second, then aimlessly putting it down again. He clears his throat and starts to sing to himself in a low, doleful voice: [...] "My Yosephine, come aboard de ship. Long time Ay wait for you." ...|$|R
500|$|Without the {{education}} or connections that a university education {{would have provided}} he was almost entirely unemployed for several years. Kenyon instead lived off an £80 allowance from his father, and money from his richer relatives, spending the time watching Lord Mansfield conduct cases at the Court of King's Bench. His early business was almost entirely conveyancing, and to make extra money he began to attend the Welsh Circuit, where Tomlinson's contacts allowed him <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> small cases. After several years of this he also began attending quarter sessions at Oxford, Stafford and Shrewsbury, [...] "where he was more successful". While his work slowly began to increase, his main rise was due to his friendship with John Dunning, {{at the time a}} similarly near-unemployed barrister. In 1762 {{one of the leaders of}} the Northern Circuit died, and his work was given to Dunning; as he found himself with too many cases, he gave many to Kenyon. In 1767, for example, Kenyon dealt with 20 of Dunning's cases. As a result of his speedy and efficient work attorneys began to employ him directly, and within 10 years he was making £3,000 a year just from opinions.|$|E
500|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{comes home}} to find her wall full of knife holes, a great dane roaming her apartment, and a {{complete}} stranger on her bed, all courtesy of her boyfriend, Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters).

Liz and her friend, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), go out to try <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> men, but are very unsuccessful. The next day, Dennis walks into the staff office of [...] TGS with Tracy Jordan, announcing he has found a new apartment and reads a heartfelt letter to Liz. The staff suddenly turns on Liz after Dennis walks out, and Jenna suggests to Liz that in light of the previous night's disaster, she should re-consider getting back together with him. She suggests making a list of pros and cons. Liz compiles her list of pros and cons. She marks down a positive remark after coming {{home to find}} that Dennis has cleaned up the apartment, put up shelves and a TV stand, and left her dinner. In the evening, Dennis returns with an early Christmas present for Liz. She invites him in, but soon sees Dennis on Datelines To Catch a Predator.

500|$|The episode {{opens in}} Havana, Cuba. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) surprises a now-bearded Duncan (Teddy Dunn), who denies killing Lilly (Amanda Seyfried). At school, Veronica avoids Logan, but that night, Logan {{shows up at}} Veronica's door. Logan apologizes for owning GHB before Veronica informs him about her rape. Logan denies being her rapist, but Veronica says she'll punish whoever it is, even if it's Logan. Veronica talks to Meg (Alona Tal) about the party, and she {{mentions}} seeing Veronica being harassed by some boys before she left. Keith returns Duncan to the Kanes before threatening Clarence Wiedman (Christopher B. Duncan). Veronica approaches Luke (Sam Huntington) about a trip to Tijuana <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> GHB; he admits getting the drugs, {{but he says that}} he gave them to Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen). Luke states that Madison Sinclair was seen writing [...] "slut" [...] on Veronica's car after the party. Veronica confronts Madison, who says that she defaced Veronica's car because she made out with Dick, her boyfriend. However, Veronica doesn't remember this incident due to the effects of the drugs. Veronica attempts to barge in on a fight between Keith and Alicia over Wallace's involvement in the Wiedman case, but her intervention does nothing to defuse the situation. Veronica talks to Casey, who confirms the make out sessions with Dick and Cassidy, and Veronica was also forced to make out with Shelly for the boys' amusement.|$|E

500|$|While walking home, Marty {{experiences}} {{a vision of}} Gotts attacking Forester. Marty eventually makes {{her way to the}} crime scene where she finds the victim's body. She returns to the police station and confesses to the murders. To convince the police that she is the murderer, Marty tells Pennock where Gotts hid the heroin he stole from the first victim, but none of the prints on the heroin belong to Marty, furthering Mulder's argument that she is, in fact, innocent. Mulder approaches Marty and tells her that he researched her mother's murder—she died from a stab wound to the kidney, the same way Gotts kills his victims. Mulder concludes that Marty was given her ability when her then-pregnant mother was killed by Gotts; it is revealed that Gotts is actually Marty's father and that he had spent thirty years (her whole life) in prison until being paroled. Marty sends Mulder and Scully to the bar that Gotts was last seen at, while Pennock takes her back to her apartment <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> things before entering protective custody. While packing, Marty has a vision of Gotts in the apartment lobby; she knocks Pennock out, takes his gun and waits. [...] Mulder figures out that Marty had been experiencing Gotts' sight for the thirty years he was in prison; in effect spending her whole life in prison. Mulder and Scully arrive at Marty's apartment to find Gotts dead by his daughter's hands. Marty is convicted of his murder and is sentenced to prison, but she is finally free of her father's vision.|$|E
