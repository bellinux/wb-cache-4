5|$|With {{the growth}} of {{settlement}} in Pearsall's Flats, which was later the location of Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans {{for the establishment of}} schools and churches. A log structure, which served as both a school and a church, was built at Pearsall's Flats around 1752 near Fort Pearsall. To provide for a teacher's payment, a form was circulated around Romney and each parent indicated on the paper how many of their children would attend the school and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> the teacher would expect. By the time Romney was surveyed by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron laid out the town of Romney in 1762, the log school was still in existence. That year, a stone school building was erected on the site to the immediate north of the old Hampshire County Courthouse and became known as Romney Academy.|$|E
