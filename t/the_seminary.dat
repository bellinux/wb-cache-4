5|$|In January, 1951, {{the student}} body of the Presbyterian McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago {{sponsored}} Béla, Eva, Tibor and Robert Banathy as refugees to the United States. Bánáthy lived with his family at <b>the</b> <b>Seminary,</b> where he worked nights 60 hours a week shoveling coal to fire <b>the</b> <b>Seminary</b> furnace. At the same time, he was studying English from a book. He occasionally preached at nearby Hungarian churches. His wife found work as a machine operator and Tibor, their third son, entered American public school.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, {{the student}} bodies of Rutgers College and <b>the</b> <b>Seminary</b> began to expand, {{overcrowding}} the space provided at the Queens Campus. <b>The</b> <b>seminary</b> professors realized that students renting rooms at boarding {{houses in the}} city were paying more for their housing than students at other seminaries—over double the costs of housing at New York City's Union Theological Seminary or at nearby Princeton Theological Seminary. The professors surmised {{that it would be}} cheaper to build a seminary building that provided both student housing and instruction space.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Toulmin's {{letters of}} {{recommendation}} from Jefferson and Madison, {{the board of}} trustees of Transylvania Seminary (now Transylvania University) in Lexington, Kentucky, elected him president of <b>the</b> <b>seminary</b> in February 1794. He was the first president of <b>the</b> <b>seminary</b> who was not a Presbyterian, and his election was effected when the Baptist and more liberal members of the board united against the more conservative Presbyterian members. His Unitarian views offended many of the conservative board members, and at their insistence, the Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation requiring a unanimous vote of the board of regents to re-elect the seminary's president. Toulmin resigned in protest in April 1796.|$|E
5000|$|During the 2000s, {{nearly all}} <b>the</b> <b>Seminary's</b> land and {{buildings}} were sold to Boston College (BC), the neighboring Jesuit-run college. In 2001, BC leased St. Clement's Hall, formerly the site of <b>the</b> <b>Seminary's</b> undergraduate division, and it bought the property in June 2004. [...] In May 2007, the Archdiocese sold <b>the</b> <b>Seminary's</b> open land, its library building and several other structures.

5|$|The West Florida Seminary, {{also known}} as the Florida State Seminary, opened for classes in Tallahassee in 1857, {{absorbing}} the Florida Institute, which had been established as an inducement for the state to place <b>the</b> <b>seminary</b> in the city. The former Florida Institute property, located where the historic Westcott Building now stands, is the oldest continuously used site of higher education in Florida. The area, slightly west of the state Capitol, was formerly and ominously known as Gallows Hill, a place for public executions in early Tallahassee. In 1858 <b>the</b> <b>seminary</b> absorbed the Tallahassee Female Academy, established in 1843, and became coeducational.|$|E
5|$|All the {{buildings}} of the University in Sampaloc {{with the exception of}} <b>the</b> <b>Seminary,</b> the Printing Press and two first floors of Main Building were occupied. The war internees occupied three floors of the Main Building, the entire Education Building (presently UST Hospital), the Domestic Science building, and the School of Mines building. Communication between them and the outside world was prevented by the Japanese as much as possible.|$|E
5|$|During {{his studies}} there, Leontovych {{continued}} to advance his skills on the violin {{and learned to}} play {{a variety of other}} instruments.

5|$|In 1586 Robert {{was educated}} at Gloucester Hall in Oxford, a college {{noted for its}} Catholic intake. Those either {{studying}} at university or wishing to take public office could not do so without first swearing the Oath of Supremacy, an act which would have compromised Catesby's Catholic faith. Presumably to avoid this consequence, he left without taking his degree, and may then have attended <b>the</b> <b>seminary</b> college of Douai.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, the Synod paid a {{significant}} portion of Queen's College's debts in order to place the institution on a secure financial footing and enable it to reopen. With the second reopening, the Synod provided clergymen to serve at the college as theology professors. Livingston had dedicated several years to raising money for the effort but died shortly before Queen's College reopened in 1825. The Rev. Philip Milledoler, a Reformed clergyman from New York City, was appointed to fill the vacancy created by Livingston's death. Milledoler persuaded one of his parishioners, Colonel Henry Rutgers (1745–1830), to support the college. The trustees subsequently renamed it Rutgers College in his honour. At first, the Synod exercised oversight over the operations of the college, but by 1840 directed its attentions solely to the operation of <b>the</b> <b>seminary.</b> During this period Rutgers College, the college's grammar school (now Rutgers Preparatory School), and <b>the</b> <b>seminary</b> shared one building, known as Old Queens (built 1809-1823) until the two schools separated operations entirely in 1856.|$|E
5|$|In 1864, {{unhappy with}} the {{direction}} of the General Synod and its seminary at Gettysburg, the Ministerium established a new seminary in Philadelphia, and asked Charles Porterfield Krauth to head <b>the</b> <b>seminary</b> (now known as the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia). This was followed, in 1867, with the Ministerium being joined by thirteen other church bodies in a more conservative and confessional organization known as the General Council.|$|E

5|$|New Brunswick Theological Seminary, {{which has}} its main campus in New Brunswick, New Jersey, was founded in 1784 and is the oldest {{independent}} Protestant seminary extant in the United States. It {{is one of two}} operated by the Reformed Church in America (RCA), a mainline Reformed Protestant denomination in Canada and the United States that follows the theological tradition and Christian practice of John Calvin. First established in New York City under the leadership of the Rev. John Henry Livingston, who instructed aspiring ministers in his home, <b>the</b> <b>seminary</b> established its presence in New Brunswick in 1810. Although a separate institution, the seminary's early development in New Brunswick was closely connected with that of Rutgers University (formerly Queen's College and Rutgers College) before establishing its own campus in the city in 1856. Since 1986, <b>the</b> <b>seminary</b> has offered classes at a satellite campus on the grounds of St. John's University in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, New York.|$|E
