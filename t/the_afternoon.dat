5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Schools usually let out during <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> as well.|$|E
5|$|As Allen {{approached}} the Gulf of Mexico, hurricane warnings were raised for the northeast Yucatán peninsula of Mexico from <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> of August 6 {{into the morning}} of August 8. Gale warnings were in effect for the Florida Keys from the evening of August 6 into the early morning of August 8. As Allen approached its final landfall, the northeast Mexican coast and Texas coast were placed under a hurricane watch from the morning of August 8 until the morning of August 9 for Mexico and <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> of August 9 for Texas. Hurricane warnings were posted for the Texas coast during <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> of August 8, and were lowered north of Freeport, Texas during <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> of August 9 and south of Freeport during <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> of August 10. Gale warnings and a hurricane watch were issued for the Louisiana coast from Vermilion Bay westward from <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> of August 8 into <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> of August 9. Hurricane warnings were in effect for northeast Mexico from the early afternoon of August 9 into the late afternoon of August 10. Hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings between High Island, Texas and Freeport, Texas between the late afternoon of August 9 and the late afternoon of August 10. Hurricane watches were dropped for the Louisiana coast during the late afternoon of August 9. Hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings for the lower Texas coast south of Freeport from the late afternoon of August 10 into the early morning of August 11.|$|E
5|$|Human {{productivity}} routinely {{decreases in}} <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Power plants have shown significant reductions in productivity in <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> {{compared to the}} morning, the largest differences occurring on Saturdays and the smallest on Mondays. One 1950s study covering two female factory workers for six months found that their productivity was 13 percent lower in <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> the least productive time being their last hour at work. It was summarized that the differences came from personal breaks and unproductive activities at the workplace. Another, larger study found that afternoon declines in productivity were greater during longer work shifts.|$|E

5|$|In the {{two main}} engagements, the fighter losses had been about equal. The big {{difference}} was the bombers losses. Fighter Command had had greater success against <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> attack rather than the morning assault, which it out numbered 2:1. The ratio of German fighters to bombers had been 3:1 in the morning but 5:1 in <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> so there were more targets. The more bombers Kesselring sent, the more were lost.|$|E

Exchanges resumed following a brief gap in the morning. South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity announced that {{the armed forces of}} South Ossetia were ready to go on the offensive in the next few hours. At 14:00 on 7 August, two Georgian peacekeepers were killed in Avnevi as a result of Ossetian shelling. At about 14:30, Georgian tanks, 122mm howitzers and 203mm self-propelled artillery began heading towards South Ossetia to dissuade separatists from additional attacks. During <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> OSCE monitors recorded Georgian military traffic, including artillery, on roads near Gori.

As such they planned a land {{invasion}} on the Gallipoli Peninsula. On <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> of 25 April 1915, Murray's 16th Battalion landed at Ari Burnu, Gallipoli. Setting their machine gun on Pope's Hill, Black and Murray fired their gun throughout <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> {{and into the}} night. The following day, the battalion's two machine gun crews sniped at the Turkish soldiers on Russell's Top, and Murray and his gunner continued fighting during the counterattack on 26–27 April, despite being wounded.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>afternoon,</b> {{especially}} the early afternoon, {{is associated with}} a dip in a variety of areas of human cognitive and productive functioning. Notably, motor vehicle accidents occur more frequently in the early afternoon, when drivers presumably have recently finished lunch. A study of motor accidents in Sweden between 1987 and 1991 found that the time around 5 pm had by far the most accidents: around 1,600 at 5 pm compared to around 1,000 each at 4 pm and 6 pm. This trend may have been influenced by <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> rush hour, but the morning rush hour showed a much smaller increase. In Finland, accidents in the agriculture industry are most common in <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> specifically Monday afternoons in September.|$|E

5|$|This first {{hurricane}} of the season's {{effects were}} first noted in Santa Clara, Cuba, where rainy and windy conditions were observed on <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> of June 14. Several vessels sank during the hurricane {{during the early}} morning hours of June 15. The system was thought to have entered the Florida Straits during the evening. The system began to travel towards the west-northwest, steadily strengthening into a hurricane by <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> On June 17, a minimum pressure of 979 mbar (hPa; 28.91 inHg) was recorded, as the hurricane passed over southern Florida.|$|E
5|$|A bicycle-mounted {{detachment}} of the 183rd Infantry Division captured Murska Sobota without encountering resistance. During the day, the German Luftwaffe bombed and strafed Yugoslav positions and {{troops on the}} march. By <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> German troops had captured Dolnja Lendava, and by the evening it had become clear to the Germans that the Yugoslavs would not be resisting stubbornly at the border. XLVI Motorised Corps was then ordered to begin seizing bridges over the Mura at Mursko Središće and Letinja, and over the Drava at Gyékényes and Barcs. The local attacks were sufficient to inflame dissent within the largely Croat 4th Army, who refused to resist Germans they considered their liberators from Serbian oppression during the interwar period. In <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers of Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 escorted by Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters caught the Breguet 19s of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group {{on the ground at}} Velika Gorica, destroying most of them.|$|E
5|$|A {{low-level}} circulation {{formed from}} the frontal cloud band on September 26 about 460miles (740km) east of central Florida.

An Air Force reconnaissance flight {{was sent to}} Dean on September 27 and only reported winds of 35mph (55km/h) at 23miles (37kilometres) from the center. A pressure of 999millibars (29.50inHg) indicated that Dean was strengthening as it headed northward. Additionally, satellite pictures showed that the subtropical cyclone was emerging from the cloud. This data also showed that the storm was gaining tropical characteristics and was given the name Dean on <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> of September 27.|$|E
