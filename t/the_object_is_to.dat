5|$|Joust is an arcade game {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1982. While {{not the first}} game to feature two-player cooperative play, Joust was more successful than its predecessors and popularized the concept. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards.|$|E
5000|$|... "Credit Crawl": Credits {{appeared}} {{identifying a}} person, place, or thing, and <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> identify it.|$|R
5000|$|... "Flash Frame": A {{montage of}} images was flashed rapidly, and <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> recall 3 of <b>the</b> 5 themed <b>objects.</b>|$|R
50|$|A 32-foot rock-climbing wall {{stood in}} front of the contenders in this event. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make it to the top. Again, two formats were used.|$|R
5|$|Defender is a {{two-dimensional}} side-scrolling shooting game {{set on the}} surface of an unnamed planet. The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain, flying either to the left or right. A joystick controls the ship's elevation, and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three ships to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks. A ship is lost if it is hit by an enemy, or hit by an enemy projectile, or if a hyperspace jump goes wrong (as they randomly do). After exhausting all ships, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|Joust 2: Survival of the Fittest is an arcade game {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1986. It is {{a sequel to}} Williams' 1982 game Joust. Like its predecessor, Joust 2 is a 2D aerial combat game with platforms to land on. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards. Joust 2 features improved audio-visuals and new features such as mutant buzzards created by eggs falling into lava, the ability to transform from an ostrich to a flying horse, and differently themed levels. Waves no longer seamlessly flow into each other; the gameplay is divided into separate screens with transitions between them.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match that}} aired was a Stretcher match between Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam, in which <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> place your {{opponent}} {{on a stretcher}} and wheel the stretcher across a finish line. The match {{went back and forth}} before Van Dam attempted to perform a Somersault Plancha onto Orton, but Orton moved out of the way. Orton put Van Dam on the stretcher and tried to wheel him across the finishing line. Van Dam, however, managed to kick Orton in the head and put him onto the stretcher. Van Dam wheeled the stretcher over the line for the win. After the match, Orton attacked Van Dam, executing an Elevated DDT off the barricade onto the arena floor. Van Dam was then carried out of the arena on the stretcher.|$|E
5000|$|... "Hidden Camera": A {{miniature}} {{video camera}} was placed somewhere, {{such as in}} a trash can or a grocery bag, and <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> guess <b>the</b> camera's location.|$|R

5000|$|... "Mixed Signals": Video {{images of}} one {{activity}} would be presented onscreen, while the audio of another activity would <b>be</b> played simultaneously. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> identify <b>the</b> latter activity.|$|R
5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb {{them before they}} slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E
25|$|Given {{a set of}} {{sequence}} fragments <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{find the}} shortest common supersequence.|$|E

50|$|Reducing {{the size}} of the {{aperture}} of the lens deepens the focus. At a pinhole size this will increase in effect, though <b>the</b> closer <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camera, the shorter the distance between focussed objects.|$|R
25|$|Terrier manâ€” Carries out fox control. Most hunts where <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{kill the}} fox will employ a terrier man, {{whose job it}} is to control the terriers which may be used {{underground}} to corner or flush the fox. Often voluntary terrier men will follow the hunt as well. In the UK and Ireland, they often ride quadbikes with their terriers in boxes on their bikes.|$|E
25|$|The {{lower river}} between Jesus Lock and Baits Bite Lock is the {{training}} and racing home of the Cambridge University Combined Boat Clubs' university and college, and the Cambridgeshire Rowing Association's town, rowing teams. The Cambridge Lent, May and Town Bumps rowing races, where boats set off at regular intervals, and <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> catch and touch (that is, 'bump') the boat in front, are held here.|$|E
25|$|Incoming {{parallel}} {{rays are}} focused by a converging lens onto a spot one focal length from the lens, {{on the far}} side of the lens. This is called the rear focal point of the lens. Rays from an object at finite distance are focused further from the lens than the focal distance; the closer <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> the lens, the further the image is from the lens.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, have it {{your own}} way, Joyce.--The morning before your storming, I {{remember}} to have led out three companies; {{though it was}} more in advance, than on either flank. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> unmask a suspected ambush." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the other}} type, the Clach Neart (or Stone of Strength), a smaller stone, {{variable}} in weight, but around 20 or 30 lb, <b>was</b> employed. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{see how far}} the stone could be thrown or putted.|$|R
50|$|The {{mission of}} the 1st Battalion <b>was</b> <b>to</b> take the {{commanding}} ground around Haid-Hits, then remove the enemy from the high ground at Sur-Les-Hys. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> facilitate a breakthrough and free surrounded elements of the 3rd Armored in Hotton.|$|R
25|$|The {{rules of}} the ballgame are not known, but it was {{probably}} similar to volleyball, where <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> keep the ball in play. In the most well-known version of the game, the players struck the ball with their hips, although some versions used forearms or employed rackets, bats, or handstones. The ball was made of solid rubber, and weighed up to 4kg or more, with sizes that differed greatly over time or according to the version played.|$|E
25|$|The Greek philosopher Plato {{wrote that}} the future {{architect}} should play at building houses as a child. A construction set {{is a collection of}} separate pieces that can be joined together to create models. Popular models to make include cars, spaceships, and houses. The things that are built are sometimes used as toys once completed, but generally speaking, <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> build things of one's own design, and old models often are broken up and the pieces reused in new models.|$|E
25|$|With {{diverging}} lenses, incoming parallel rays diverge {{after going}} through the lens, {{in such a way}} that they seem to have originated at a spot one focal length in front of the lens. This is the lens's front focal point. Rays from an object at finite distance are associated with a virtual image that is closer to the lens than the focal point, and on the same side of the lens as the object. The closer <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> the lens, the closer the virtual image is to the lens. As with mirrors, upright images produced by a single lens are virtual, while inverted images are real.|$|E
50|$|Animating <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> similar <b>to</b> motion {{tweening}} in Macromedia Flash. A keyframe <b>is</b> {{created with}} <b>the</b> <b>object</b> in <b>the</b> desired position. A second keyframe is then created and <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new desired position. One can then preview {{this with the}} convenient Preview button.|$|R
25|$|Illegal force: The FBI conspired {{with local}} police {{departments}} to threaten dissidents; to conduct illegal break-ins {{in order to}} search dissident homes; and to commit vandalism, assaults, beatings and assassinations. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> frighten or eliminate dissidents and disrupt their movements.|$|R
50|$|Two contestants, {{including}} a returning champion, competed. The contestants {{were always a}} man and a woman - at no point did two people of the same gender compete. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> match <b>the</b> answers of the six celebrity panelists to fill-in-the-blank statements.|$|R
25|$|During the game's release, Nintendo {{teamed up}} with Kellogg's and Nelsonic to develop and release a promotional Star Fox LCD game watch to those who bought a box of corn flakes and sent the order form to Kellogg's to receive the Star Fox game watch for free. In the game watch, there are four levels and <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> fly towards an attack carrier and destroy it while dodging plasma balls and falling structures. The game watch also {{includes}} a pair of earphones and a headphone jack due to the game watch missing a volume control. Nelsonic later released it in stores in a different watch appearance.|$|E
25|$|A coleo {{starts with}} the {{participants}} and a calf or bull (this depends on the age and stature of the competitors) locked behind a trap door. The trap door leads to a narrow earthen pathway about 100 metres long with high guard rails, open at the other end. When a judge gives a signal, the calf is set loose and starts running. A couple of seconds later, the riders are released and they race to grab the calf by its tail. The rider who accomplishes this first will increase speed, dragging the calf until it finally stumbles. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> accomplish this in the shortest time.|$|E
25|$|Super R.C. Pro-Am is {{a racing}} video game {{that is similar}} to its predecessor, R.C. Pro-Am, for the NES. In the game, players race remote control cars on a series of tracks. It can be played solo, with two-players via the Game Link Cable, or with three or four players via the Four Player Adapter. The game {{features}} 24 different tracks of increasing difficulty, and <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> finish in the top three in order to qualify to race in the next track. Players who do not finish in the top three may use a continue and retry the track; players get three continues, and the game ends when the player fails to finish in the top three and has no continues remaining.|$|E
5000|$|Illegal force: The FBI conspired {{with local}} police {{departments}} to threaten dissidents; to conduct illegal break-ins {{in order to}} search dissident homes; and to commit vandalism, assaults, beatings and assassinations. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> frighten or eliminate dissidents and disrupt their movements.|$|R
5000|$|Bonkers! (also {{known as}} This Game is Bonkers!) was a race-style board game {{designed}} by Paul J. Gruen and produced by Parker Brothers {{and later by}} Milton Bradley. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first player to score 12 points by adding instruction cards to the empty spaces {{in an attempt to}} move to several scoring stations. The game's slogan (for both versions) was [...] "It's Never the Same Game Twice!" ...|$|R
50|$|Two {{teams of}} two unacquainted players {{went on a}} {{shopping}} spree at six stores, each with four prizes, on a fictional street on stage. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> match <b>the</b> desired prizes with visual clues given by the contestant in the quickest amount of time.|$|R
