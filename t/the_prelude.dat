5|$|In 2003, Alexander DeConde {{asserted}} that requiring background checks for all gun show sales was <b>the</b> <b>prelude</b> to registration and their Second Amendment rights would be jeopardized.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>prelude</b> to the {{impeachment}} of President Clinton, Ford conferred with former President Carter and the two agreed to not speak publicly on the controversy, a pact broken by Carter when answering a question from a student at Emory University.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a strong}} tonal {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>preludes</b> that suggests that the published order of <b>the</b> <b>preludes</b> is not arbitrary. For example, <b>the</b> first three <b>preludes</b> in <b>the</b> first book (Danseuses de Delphes, Voiles, and Le Vent dans la Plaine) revolve around the key of B. In these first three <b>preludes,</b> allusions to <b>the</b> key of B disappear and reappear, yet {{a strong sense of}} fluidity and connection between <b>the</b> <b>preludes</b> is still maintained.|$|R
50|$|Alexis Weissenberg {{as well as}} Boris Berezovsky have {{recorded}} all <b>the</b> <b>preludes</b> written by Rachmaninoff. These works are available on various types of media. Many others recorded outstanding interpretations of <b>the</b> <b>preludes,</b> including Nikolai Lugansky and Van Cliburn.|$|R
50|$|Rachmaninoff {{composed}} the Op. 33 Études-Tableaux at his Ivanovka estate in Tambov, Russia between August and September 1911, {{the year after}} completing his second set of preludes, Op. 32. While the Op. 33 Études-Tableaux share some stylistic points with <b>the</b> <b>preludes,</b> they are actually not very similar. Rachmaninoff concentrates on establishing well-defined moods and developing musical themes in <b>the</b> <b>preludes.</b> There is also an academic facet to <b>the</b> <b>preludes,</b> as he wrote 24 of them, one {{in each of the}} 24 major and minor keys.|$|R
5|$|The {{battle is}} re-enacted during the Come and Take It celebration in Gonzales every October. In and around Gonzales are nine Texas {{historical}} markers which commemorate various locations used in <b>the</b> <b>prelude</b> to the battle.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's opera {{based on}} the legend of Ulysses and Penelope was first {{performed}} in 1913, after which the composer published a version of <b>the</b> <b>prelude</b> transcribed for piano. The piece, in G minor, contrasts a gravely noble andante moderato theme representing Penelope with a forthright theme for Ulysses. The polyphonic writing transfers effectively from the orchestral original to the piano.|$|E
5|$|Lane was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} of preparedness in <b>the</b> <b>prelude</b> to U.S. involvement in World War I. In early 1917, he urged Wilson to authorize the arming and convoying of merchant vessels. Wilson refused, but changed his mind when informed of the Zimmermann Telegram. In a critical Cabinet meeting in March 1917, Lane, with other Cabinet members, urged American intervention in the war.|$|E
50|$|Flint The King {{was written}} by Mary Kirchoff and Douglas Niles. It is the second volume in <b>the</b> <b>Preludes</b> II series, and the fifth volume in <b>the</b> overall <b>Preludes</b> series.|$|R
50|$|Bach {{recycled}} some of <b>the</b> <b>preludes</b> and fugues {{from earlier}} sources: the 1720 Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, for instance, contains versions of eleven of <b>the</b> <b>preludes</b> of <b>the</b> first {{book of the}} Well-Tempered Clavier. <b>The</b> C major <b>prelude</b> and fugue in book one was originally in C major - Bach added a key signature of seven sharps and adjusted some accidentals to convert it to the required key.|$|R
50|$|Rachmaninoff {{completed}} Prelude No. 5 in 1901. <b>The</b> remaining <b>preludes</b> {{were completed}} after Rachmaninoff's marriage to his cousin Natalia Satina: Nos. 1, 4, and 10 premiered in Moscow on February 10, 1903, {{and the remaining}} seven were completed soon thereafter. 1900-1903 were difficult years for Rachmaninoff and his motivation for writing <b>the</b> <b>Preludes</b> was predominantly financial. Rachmaninoff composed the works in the Hotel America, financially dependent on his cousin Alexander Siloti, to whom <b>the</b> <b>Preludes</b> are dedicated.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>prelude</b> of {{the novel}} begins with a 1982 letter from the elderly {{daughter}} of Rupert Brooke by a Tahitian women to Nell Golightly, asking Nell to help the daughter better understand her father. Nell responds, including a narrative of the time spent by Brooke at The Orchard in Grantchester from 1909 until his retreat in Tahiti in 1914, which becomes the rest {{of the novel}}.|$|E
5|$|After {{the nine}} Études-Tableaux, Op. 39, Rachmaninoff {{composed}} several minor works in 1917. The Oriental Sketch is a fast-paced piece littered with sixteenth note figures. The piece {{was not intended}} {{to be associated with the}} Orient; the title was given by the publisher. <b>The</b> <b>Prelude</b> in D minor, a dark piece with thick and fast moving chords that repeatedly descend into low register, is a manifestation of his unhappiness with the October Revolution. The manuscript survived and was first published in 1973. His penultimate piano composition (only his Corelli Variations came later) was a one-page piece entitled Fragments, a brief nostalgic piece from his final days in Moscow. It was first published in the magazine, The Etude, in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaries {{regarded}} Organt {{as something}} of a salacious novelty and it was quickly banned, but censors who tried to confiscate it discovered that few copies were available anywhere. It did not sell well and resulted in a financial loss for its author. The public's taste for literature had changed in <b>the</b> <b>prelude</b> to the Revolution, and Saint-Just's taste changed with it: aside from a few pages of an unfinished novel found amidst his papers {{at the end of his}} life, Saint-Just devoted his future writing entirely to undecorated essays of social and political theory. With his previous ambitions of literary and lawyerly fame unfulfilled, Saint-Just directed his focus on the single goal of revolutionary command.|$|E

5|$|In November, he {{traveled}} to Japan {{to take part in}} the Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series. Young was the starter in an exhibition game against the Yomiuri Giants, which was memorable for the major leaguers' three-run ninth-inning rally to earn a tie. This game was <b>the</b> <b>prelude</b> to the five-game series which began with three games at the Tokyo Dome and was followed by games in Osaka and Fukuoka. Young pitched the fourth game of the series. Young also blogged on behalf of mlb.com about daily life during the trip. He detailed visits with United States Ambassador to Japan Tom Schieffer, time in the Harajuku, and travels on the Bullet Train.|$|E
5|$|Messager's career lasted {{into the}} {{beginning}} of the recording era. In New York in November 1918, with the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra, he recorded Les Chasseresses and Cortège de Bacchus from Sylvia by Delibes, Sérénade and Mules from Impressions d'Italie by Charpentier, the Bacchanale from Samson et Dalila and <b>the</b> <b>Prelude</b> to Le Déluge, both by Saint-Saëns, and 4½-minute extracts from Capriccio Espagnol by Rimsky-Korsakov and from Le Rouet d'Omphale by Saint-Saëns. A recording of Véronique on an Edison Gold Moulded Record cylinder was made before July 1907 (actual date unknown).|$|E
5|$|The design—effectively a {{frame for}} two scenes {{depicted}} through Rayner Hoff's marble reliefs and bronze statues—shows <b>the</b> <b>prelude</b> and the epilogue to war, depicting both {{the willingness of}} youth to answer {{the call of duty}} and the extent of the sacrifices which they made. In this, the work is not displaying a material victory, but instead a victory of the spirit. At the insistence of W. F. J. McCann, president of the Returned Soldiers' League, bronze tablets were cast to line the walls of an inner shrine, on which are listed the names of all South Australians who died during the Great War.|$|E
40|$|Ocean Waves: Nine Preludes for Solo Piano is a {{collection}} of preludes that sets ocean waves and sea currents for piano. <b>The</b> <b>preludes</b> range from being minimal and sparse in content, to being melodic and heavy in material. Waves of notes are used to push in and out of new musical ideas throughout <b>the</b> <b>preludes.</b> <b>The</b> work experiments with note density, motivic growth, and multiple pitch centers and harmonic structures all while centering around the musical color of each prelude...|$|R

The [...] "Russian" [...] quality of <b>the</b> Op. 23 <b>preludes</b> is often noted by listeners: after hearing Boris Asafyev play <b>the</b> <b>preludes,</b> <b>the</b> painter Ilya Repin noted a streak of Russian nationalism and originality in rhythm and melody. At the same recital, Vladimir Stasov praised the characteristic [...] "Rachmaninoff sound" [...] and unusual and innovative bell-like quality of the pieces, and Maxim Gorky simply noted, [...] "How well he hears the silence." ...|$|R

The episodes are directed by Masahiko Ohkura and animated by the Japanese animation studios Asahi Production and BeSTACK, with the 3D modeling done by Gonzo. The plot of the episodes follows Mari Wakatake's relationship with the enigmatic Hagino Senkōji, a member of an alien race known as the Arume, and <b>the</b> <b>prelude</b> to an invasion by the Arume.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>prelude</b> of the Ramakien, the Thai {{version of}} the Ramayana, the demon Nontok is charmed and killed by Mohini-Vishnu. Nontok misuses a divine weapon {{given to him by}} Shiva. The four-armed Mohini-Vishnu enchants Nontok and then attacks him. In his last moments, the demon accuses Vishnu of foul play saying that Vishnu first seduced him and then {{attacked}} him. Vishnu decrees that in his next birth, Nontok will be born as the ten-headed demon Ravana and Vishnu will be a mortal man called Rama. He will then fight him and defeat him.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the two opposing armed forces, the Red and White Guards, imposed a state of dual power and multiple sovereignty on Finnish society, typically <b>the</b> <b>prelude</b> to a civil war. The decisive cleavage between the guards broke out during the General strike; the Reds executed several political opponents in southern Finland, and the first armed clashes between the Whites and Reds broke out. In total, 34 casualties were reported. Eventually, the political rivalries of 1917 led to a race for weapons and an escalation towards civil war.|$|E

5|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Solaris {{features}} Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale prelude for organ, Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, BWV 639, played by Leonid Roizman, and an electronic score by Eduard Artemyev. <b>The</b> <b>prelude</b> {{is the central}} musical theme of Solaris. Tarkovsky initially wanted the film to be devoid of music and asked composer Artemyev to orchestrate ambient sounds as a musical score. The latter proposed subtly introducing orchestral music. In counterpoint to classical music as Earth's theme is fluid electronic music as the theme for the planet Solaris. The character of Hari has her own subtheme, a cantus firmus based upon J. S. Bach's music featuring Artemyev's composition atop it; it is heard at Hari's death and at story's end.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the context}} of the battle itself, the failure of the Red Army to {{properly}} regroup during <b>the</b> <b>prelude</b> to the battle and the ability of the Germans to effectively collect intelligence on Soviet movements {{played an important role in}} the outcome. Poor Soviet performance in the north and equally poor intelligence-gathering at the hands of Stavka and front headquarters, also eventually spelled doom for the offensive. Nonetheless, despite this poor performance, it underscored a dedicated evolution of operations and tactics within the Red Army which borrowed and refined the pre-war theory, Soviet deep battle.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{both sides}} wished for a decisive battle that would tip {{the war in}} their favor. However, Lazenby {{believed}} that Mardonius' actions during the Plataea campaign were not consistent with an aggressive policy. He interprets the Persian operations during <b>the</b> <b>prelude</b> not as attempts to force the Allies into battle but as attempts to force the Allies into retreat (which indeed became the case). Mardonius may have felt he had little to gain in battle {{and that he could}} simply wait for the Greek alliance to fall apart (as it had nearly done over the winter). There can be little doubt from Herodotus' account that Mardonius was prepared to accept battle on his own terms, however. Regardless of the exact motives, the initial strategic situation allowed both sides to procrastinate, since food supplies were ample for both armies. Under these conditions, the tactical considerations outweighed the strategic need for action.|$|E
