5|$|Adud al-Dawla, {{in order}} to {{maintain}} peace, established marriage ties with several rulers; his daughter was married to the Abbasid caliph at-Ta'i, while another was married to the Samanids and the Ziyarid ruler Bisutun.

Adud al-Dawla also had a younger son named Baha' al-Dawla. Abu'l-Husain Ahmad was supported by his mother and his uncle Fuladh ibn Manadhar as the heir of the Buyid Empire. However, Abu Kalijar Marzuban, because of his more prominent descent, was appointed as heir of the Buyid Empire by Adud al-Dawla.|$|E

5|$|Walter married Emma or Emmelina {{and they}} had three sons– Roger, Hugh and Walter. Roger was the heir to Weobley and Walter became Abbot of Gloucester Abbey. Occasionally the elder Walter is claimed to have married twice– once to Emma and once to an Ermeline, but this is {{probably}} a confusion of the variations of Emma's name. Walter and Emma also had a daughter who became a nun at St Mary's Abbey, Winchester. A niece was married to Ansfrid de Cormeilles. Considerable confusion exists about Sybil, the wife of Pain fitzJohn. C. P. Lewis names her as <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> of Walter, but W. E. Wightman calls her <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> of Hugh, Walter's son. Yet another pedigree has her as <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> of Agnes, <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> of Walter.

5|$|All {{accounts}} {{agree that}} Pain married in 1115 {{and that his}} wife was named Sybil, although the identity of Sybil's parents is unclear. Pain's Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry states that he married Sybil Talbot, the niece of Hugh de Lacy. The Complete Peerage states that he married Sybil, <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> of Geoffrey Talbot and Talbot's wife Agnes, who was herself probably <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> of Walter de Lacy. The historian K. S. B. Keats-Rohan states that Pain married Sybil de Lacy, <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> of Hugh de Lacy, a view shared by fellow historians Judith Green and Paul Dalton. Others such as Bruce Coplestone-Crow and David Crouch agree with the Oxford Dictionary of National Biographys designation of Sybil as Hugh's niece, and daughter of Geoffrey Talbot and Agnes, the sister of Hugh de Lacy.|$|E
