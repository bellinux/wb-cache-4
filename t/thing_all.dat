When Sam returns, it is clear he knows these two strangers. It soon transpires that the three of them were all part of a sting: Joanna Rupelford does not actually exist, the flat has been set up for six months, there are cameras all over the flat (including the bedroom, which is some consolation to Rosie for earlier), and the operation to entrap a drugs courier is due to take place that night. Maurice is angry with Sam, who evidently does this sort of <b>thing</b> <b>all</b> the time, for disrupting the plan.|$|E

500|$|The {{animation}} of [...] "Sailor Mouth" [...] {{was directed}} by Andrew Overtoom, and the episode was written by Walt Dohrn, Paul Tibbitt, and Merriwether Williams. Dohrn and Tibbitt also served as storyboard directors, and Carson Kugler, William Reiss and Erik Wiese worked as storyboard artists. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg has described the episode plot as [...] "a classic <b>thing</b> <b>all</b> kids go through."

500|$|The rabbi's {{defenders}} strongly {{objected to}} the decision. His primary supporter, synagogue vice president Louis Jackson, who had broken the story to the press, described the congregation as a [...] "collection of jackasses", with the [...] "chief jackass" [...] being the president Louis Schwartz, who Jackson accused of eating ham himself, and of stealing from the synagogue's charity boxes. Jackson was expelled from the congregation, and subsequently convicted of libel and fined $100 (today $) for making the accusations, while Rosenberg sued the synagogue for his salary. Rosenberg died of pneumonia in April 1893, {{at the age of}} 43, his [...] "health and spirits", according to a contemporary New York Times report, [...] "broken" [...] by the expulsion. At the funeral, Jackson berated the congregation's members, who, he charged, had [...] "hounded, hunted, driven [...] to a grave of misery", and allegedly threatened to kill one of them with a stone taken from the newly dug grave.

500|$|Unlike McKay and Gill, however, Ferguson praised both Davies' {{acting and}} the episode as a whole, deeming it [...] "the best thing on {{television}} all week".

500|$|After Halo 3, {{development}} studio Bungie {{created an}} internal team {{to work on}} Peter Jackson's planned Halo game, Halo Chronicles. Chronicles was eventually canceled and the team began working on a standalone expansion project—Halo 3: ODST—while another team, led by creative director Marcus Lehto and design lead Christian Allen, worked on Reach. The team considered many different concepts and approaches to the game; among the rejected ideas was a sequel to Halo 3. The team eventually settled on a prequel to the first Halo game in brainstorming sessions. It would {{take place on the}} planet Reach, during a pivotal time in the war. [...] "Reach, as a fictional planet, was just a great candidate [...] play around with. It's such a rich world, with such a great fiction surrounding it," [...] said Lehto. [...] "We were like: 'Okay, that's it. We've just got a lot of things we can do there so we can build an immense story with it.'" [...] No longer burdened with continuing the story threads of the Halo trilogy, Bungie used Reach to introduce new characters and settings. As Reach ends with the destruction of the titular planet, Bungie wanted to be sure players still felt a sense of accomplishment and success. [...] "It is a challenge overall to ensure the player feels they're doing the right <b>thing</b> <b>all</b> the way to the end," [...] said Lehto.|$|E

They performed the Beatles's [...] "Yer Blues", because Clapton had performed it with Lennon for the Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, and his two solo songs, [...] "Give Peace a Chance" [...] and [...] "Cold Turkey", the latter of which had its premiere at the festival. [...] "Cold Turkey", presented as [...] "the newest song that John wrote" [...] by Ono, had Lennon reading the lyrics off a clip-board. Ono selected a song that was to be B-side of [...] "Cold Turkey," [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)", which also had its premiere at the festival. Shortly before the band went into [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko", Lennon announced that Ono was [...] "gonna do her <b>thing</b> <b>all</b> over you". The band closed with an electric version of the Wedding Album track [...] "John John (Let's Hope for Peace)", an extended experimental number consisting of her screaming the title repeatedly to the feedback of the electric guitars. The number, and the Plastic Ono Band's participation in the concert, ended with the band's departure from stage leaving their guitars and bass to resonate until Mal Evans turned off the amplifiers. With their stage remarks, Lennon and Ono linked their appearance there to their ongoing campaign for peace.|$|E

[...] Maslansky also stated that [...] "everyone has a very specific look, and you can vary within that look, but it’s not over the top. It has to feel realistic and feel very grounded in this authentic reality we’ve created in Hell’s Kitchen." [...] On Jones' costume, Maslansky said she [...] "considers her clothing to be an armor and a shield and something that helps her maintain a distance from other people and privacy. It keeps her from having to deal with the rest of humanity in a certain sort of way." [...] At least 10 versions of Jones' jacket were made, which started as an Acne Studios leather motorcycle jacket that had any [...] "bells and whistles and any additional superfluous design details" [...] removed, while 20 pairs of jeans were used, with both being aged and distressed.|$|E
