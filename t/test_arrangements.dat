Moreover, the influence of welding on the crack growth kinetics for one PA grade is shown.

40|$|Coordination is a {{taxonomy}} of how processes change together through time. It depicts the changes {{of two or}} more variables in terms of the strength and consistency of their covariation, the directionality of their covariation (i. e., do increases in one variable correspond with increases [in-phase] or decreases [anti-phase] in the other variable), and the timing of their covariation (i. e., do both variables change at the same rate or does one variable change faster than the other). Current methods are able to characterize some, but not all, of these aspects of coordination and provide incomplete information as a result. The current study addresses this limitation by demonstrating that multivariate latent change score models can be used to fully differentiate all possible coordination patterns.
