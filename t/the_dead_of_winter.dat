His first five hours of the pre-solo training phase were flown in a PT-19A, {{in which he was}} instructed in spin recoveries, stalls, and basic turning maneuvers. He then began nearly sixty hours of Primary training in the more agile PT-18 Kaydet, practicing aerobatic maneuvers.

25|$|In the fairy-tale play The Twelve Months by Russian writer Samuil Marshak, a greedy queen decrees that {{a basket}} of gold coins shall be rewarded to anyone who can bring her galanthus flowers in <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> <b>winter.</b> A young orphan girl is sent out during a snow storm by her cruel {{stepmother}} to find {{the spirits of the}} 12 months of the year, who take pity on her and not only save her from freezing to death, but also make it possible for her to gather the flowers even in winter. The Soviet traditionally animated film The Twelve Months (1956), Lenfilm film The Twelve Months (1972) and the anime film Twelve Months (1980) (Sekai meisaku dowa mori wa ikiteiru in Japan) are based on this fairy-tale play.|$|E
25|$|It is {{probable}} that Hesiod wrote his poems down, or dictated them, rather than passed them on orally, as rhapsodes did—otherwise the pronounced personality that now emerges from the poems would surely have been diluted through oral transmission from one rhapsode to another. Pausanias asserted that Boeotians showed him an old tablet made of lead on which the Works were engraved. If he did write or dictate, it was perhaps {{as an aid to}} memory or because he lacked confidence in his ability to produce poems extempore, as trained rhapsodes could do. It certainly wasn't in a quest for immortal fame since poets in his era had probably no such notions for themselves. However, some scholars suspect the presence of large-scale changes in the text and attribute this to oral transmission. Possibly he composed his verses during idle times on the farm, in the spring before the May harvest or <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> <b>winter.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1900 s the Everett Mills, {{like all the}} other Lawrence mills were staffed mainly with European {{immigrants}} who were underpaid and overworked. When a law was passed in Massachusetts reducing the maximum number of hours that could be worked weekly by women and children, the mill owners reduced their workers’ pay accordingly and the Bread and Roses strike of 1912 erupted. Believing that a workforce of women and ethnically self-segregated immigrants living paycheck to paycheck could never band together to achieve a common goal, the mill owners were proved wrong with the strike that shut down the mills for two months in <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> <b>winter.</b> Originating with female Polish weavers at the Everett Mills who revolted upon receiving pay reduced by thirty-two cents, soon 20,000 millworkers were on strike. Helped by the Industrial Workers of the World labor union who organized meetings with representatives from all affected ethnic communities, fundraisers to support the millworkers while they were on strike, and highly visible protests meant to arouse nationwide support and outrage at national labor norms, the workers won pay increases and time-and-a-quarter for overtime work. The strike had far reaching consequences across the country when mill owners in other cities and states voluntarily raised pay in fear of similar uprisings by their own workers.|$|E

2500|$|Colter left Fort Raymond in October, 1807 with a pack {{weighing}} roughly {{thirty five}} pounds (not including his rifle and ammunition,) and traveled over five hundred miles to establish {{trade with the}} Crow nation. Over {{the course of the}} winter, he explored the region that later became Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. Colter reportedly visited at least one geyser basin, though it is now believed that he most likely was near present-day Cody, Wyoming, which at that time may have had some geothermal activity to the immediate west. Colter probably passed along portions of the shores of Jackson Lake after crossing the Continental Divide near Togwotee Pass or more likely, Union Pass in the northern Wind River Range. Colter then explored Jackson Hole below the Teton Range, later crossing Teton Pass into Pierre's Hole, known today as the Teton Basin in the state of Idaho. After heading north and then east, he is believed to have encountered Yellowstone Lake, another location in which he may have seen geysers and other geothermal features. Colter then proceeded back to Fort Raymond, arriving in March or April 1808.

40|$|West Nile {{virus was}} {{recovered}} from the brain of a red-tailed hawk that died in Westchester County, N. Y., in February 2000. Multiple foci of glial cells, lymphocytes, and a few pyknotic nuclei were observed in the brain. Three to 4 days after inoculation of Vero cells with brain homogenates, cytopathic changes were detected. The presence of West Nile virus antigen in fixed cells or cell lysates was revealed by fluorescent antibody testing or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Furthermore, Reverse transcriptase-PCR with primers specific for the NS 3 gene of West Nile virus resulted in an amplicon of the expected size (470 bp). Electron microscopy of thin sections of infected Vero cells revealed the presence of viral particles approximately 40 nm in diameter, within cytoplasmic vesicles.

40|$|Five {{separate}} test {{sites were}} established in 1994 {{to evaluate the use}} of municipal sewage sludge as a soil amendment and conditioner (hereafter referred to as “biosolids”) on the Kennecott Utah Copper Corporation’s tailings impoundment near Magna, Utah. Each site was divided into 16 test plots to evaluate four replications of the four rates of biosolids addition and incorporation into the tailings. The sites were monitored for potential leaching of total heavy metals as required under 40 CFR 503, agronomic properties, total metals, extractable metals, plant tissue analysis for heavy metals, biomass production, percent cover and plant species diversity. This paper presents the results through the second year of the project to include a comparison of soils and vegetation properties versus changes in the properties after two growing seasons. All agronomic properties of the tailings showed continued improvement following the initial biosolids addition. Significant improvements were seen when comparing the control plots to all treated plots. A statistically significant continued improvement in biomass production and percent cover by plant species occurred for all biosolids application rates when compared to the control plots. These important long-term reclamation objectives are related to the increase in biodiversity as well as to <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>dead</b> vegetation (<b>winter</b> rye) left from the 1995 growing season...|$|R
