5|$|The dagger {{taken from}} Beauchamp at his arrest {{did not match}} the wound on Sharp's body. (In his Confession, Beauchamp claimed to have buried the murder weapon by {{the bank of the}} river near where the murder took place. That knife was never found). Beauchamp's shoe did not match a track found outside Sharp's house the morning of the murder. <b>The</b> <b>posse</b> lost a {{handkerchief}} found {{at the scene of the}} crime and believed to belong to the murderer. (Beauchamp later claimed to have stolen and burned it after <b>the</b> <b>posse</b> had gone to sleep one night).|$|E
5|$|District constable was {{powerless}} {{to stop the}} violence. In the 1840s, most suburban districts of Philadelphia were policed by elected constables and part-time watchmen. When violence erupted in a district, the time-consuming process involved the constable summoning the county sheriff, who would organize a posse. During the May 6 violence, <b>the</b> <b>posse</b> arrived armed only with clubs and was {{powerless to}} do anything.|$|E

5|$|The Las Vegas {{situation}} {{was one of}} a bevy of developments that absorbed the league in the 1994 to 1995 offseason. The team was not officially disbanded until April 1995 but not before the league damaged its credibility by twice giving provisional approval to a relocation to Jackson, Mississippi, {{to the point where the}} Mississippi team was included on the 1995 internal schedule and had hired a general manager and coaching staff, only to have the deal collapse amid squabbles with the Las Vegas corporation that owned <b>the</b> <b>Posse.</b> A group from Miami, Florida tried to convince the league to let it buy the remains of <b>the</b> <b>Posse</b> and move them to South Florida as the Miami Manatees in the Miami Orange Bowl. An exhibition game between Birmingham and Baltimore was held there in June 1995 to gauge support, which drew a decent crowd just above 20,000.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt and Virgil Earp {{rode with}} the sheriff's posse {{attempting}} {{to track the}} stage robbers. Wyatt discovered an unusual boot heel print in the mud. <b>The</b> <b>posse</b> checked with a shoemaker in Bisbee and found a matching heel {{that he had just}} removed from Stilwell's boot. A further check of a Bisbee corral turned up both Spence and Stilwell, who were arrested by sheriff's deputies Billy Breakenridge and Nagel.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{gives up}} {{his share of}} the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and {{ammunition}} to a band of rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely as planned until Deke's posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed. <b>The</b> <b>posse</b> chases them to the Mexican border, only to be foiled again as the robbers blow up a trestle spanning the Rio Grande, dumping the entire posse into the river. The pursuers temporarily regroup at a riverside camp and then quickly take off again after the Bunch.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> second <b>posse</b> arrested {{several men}} {{believed}} to {{have been involved in the}} killing of the Marshals, including jury foreman Arch Scaper.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Posse's</b> {{penultimate}} {{home game}} against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers had an announced attendance of only 2,350 people — the lowest recorded attendance in CFL history. Many of those in attendance were fans who made the trip from Winnipeg. Just before the team's last scheduled home game, against the Edmonton Eskimos, Mileti announced the team would disband due to massive losses. The CFL, however, does not allow teams to fold in midseason. Instead, citing the team's wretched gates, it moved the game to Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton. Several Eskimo season ticket holders has already arrived in Las Vegas and were forced to watch the game in a ballroom at the Imperial Palace because Air Canada wouldn't allow them {{to go back to}} Edmonton on such short notice. <b>The</b> <b>Posse's</b> average attendance was a dismal 8,953.|$|R
5|$|Austin {{admitted}} {{the theft of}} the cow, saying he had had no food for his children. According to his undated charge sheet, witnesses for the state were Littrell, Martin, Lane, and Lawrence Payne.

He said Laura had been trying to take the rifle away from her son when it was fired.|$|E

5|$|In late October and November 1860, Comanches led by Peta Nocona {{conducted}} numerous {{raids on}} various settlements, {{culminating in the}} brutal killing of a pregnant woman. On hearing of these incidents, Houston sent several 25-man companies to assist Ross. A citizen's posse had tracked the raiders to their winter village along the Pease River. As the village contained at least 500 warriors and many women and children, <b>the</b> <b>posse</b> returned to the settlements to recruit additional fighters. Ross requested help from the U.S. Army at Camp Cooper, which sent 21 troops.|$|E
5|$|The Earp party rode {{north to}} the Percy Ranch, but were not welcomed by Hugh and Jim Percy, who feared the Cowboys; after a meal and some rest, they left around 3:00 {{in the morning of}} March 27. The Earp party slipped into the area near Tombstone and met with supporters, {{including}} Hairlip Charlie Smith and Warren Earp. On March 27, <b>the</b> <b>posse</b> arrived at the Sierra Bonita Ranch owned by Henry Hooker, a wealthy and prominent rancher. That night, Dan Tipton caught the first stage out of Tombstone and headed for Benson, carrying $1,000 from mining owner and Earp supporter E. B. Gage for <b>the</b> <b>posse.</b> Hooker congratulated Earp on the killing of Curly Bill. Hooker fed them and Wyatt told him he wanted to buy new mounts. Hooker was known for his purebred stallions and ran over 500 brood mares that produced horses that became known for their speed, beauty, and temperament. He provided Wyatt and his posse with new mounts, but refused to take Wyatt's money. When Behan's posse was observed in the distance, Hooker suggested Wyatt make his stand there, but Wyatt moved into the hills about three miles (5km) distant near Reilly Hill.|$|E
5|$|With <b>the</b> <b>Posse</b> folding, the Gold Miners moving, and the Pirates facing money {{troubles}} {{three of}} the four CFL expansion teams had stumbled. The league, however, still managed to add two new cities before the 1995 season. The Memphis Mad Dogs were announced in November 1994, followed by the Birmingham Barracudas in January 1995. The Memphis deal was hailed as a large step forward for the league's presence in the US as it brought in the marketing connections of Federal Express and the wealth of its founder Fred Smith.|$|E
5000|$|On December 15, 1967, a three-party {{operations}} {{agreement was}} executed between the Titusville-Cocoa Airport District, the Brevard County Flying Posse, Inc., and Dunn’s Flying Service. The essence {{of this agreement}} was for Dunn’s Flying Service {{to be able to}} operate the Radio Aeronautical Advisory Service under the FCC license of <b>the</b> Flying <b>Posse</b> to provide aeronautical advisory to local pilots (UNICOM service). The term of this operations agreement was set at eight years, so as to expire {{at the same time that}} <b>the</b> Flying <b>Posse</b> land lease expired in 1975. Prior to and during the term of <b>the</b> Flying <b>Posse’s</b> lease, all of the wooden hangars that exist today, including [...] "The Posse Shack", were constructed by Flying Posse members.

Meanwhile, Jake travels to an {{abandoned}} cabin and, in a flashback, recalls returning to it with stolen gold and then being abducted, along with a woman named Alice, by the aliens. His memories returning, Jake joins up with <b>the</b> <b>posse.</b> During the evening, the group comes upon a capsized paddle wheel steamboat that the aliens apparently dumped {{hundreds of miles from}} any rivers capable of holding it. They camp in it, and during the night the alien they were tracking kills Meacham, who sacrifices himself to save Emmett, Taggart's grandson.|$|E
5|$|During the investigation, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to match a knife taken from Beauchamp upon his arrest to the type of wound observed on Sharp's body. Efforts to match a footprint found near Sharp's house to Beauchamp were similarly unsuccessful. <b>The</b> <b>posse</b> that arrested Beauchamp had taken a bloody handkerchief from the crime scene, but had lost it on the trip back to Frankfort after the arrest. The best evidence presented by the prosecution was the testimony of Sharp's wife Eliza that she heard the killer's voice and that it was distinctly high-pitched. When given the opportunity to hear Beauchamp's voice, she identified it as that of the killer.|$|E
5|$|Though Wyatt {{received}} {{bullet holes}} in both sides of his long coat and another in his boot heel, he never received even a scratch from any bullet.

Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him get to cover. Wyatt had trouble remounting his horse because his cartridge belt had slipped down his legs. He was finally able to get on his horse, and with the rest of <b>the</b> <b>posse</b> retreated.|$|E

5|$|On the January 31, 2000 {{edition of}} Raw, the Mean Street Posse asked the Acolytes to protect them, which {{they refused to}} do, until <b>the</b> <b>Posse</b> offered to pay them. When they did, Bradshaw started the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA). In reality, the gimmick of the tag team was created by Bradshaw. To further enhance their gimmick, the APA began to appear weekly {{backstage}} in an office, dubbed the APA Office. After protecting many WWF superstars, the APA began a feud with Bull Buchanan and The Big Bossman. The feud began on the April 10, 2000 edition of Raw, where Buchanan and Bossman attacked the APA during a match, where they protected Kai En Tai. The APA, however, was unsuccessful in winning a tag team match against them at Backlash. On the May 18, 2000 edition of SmackDown!, the APA were hired to protect Crash Holly for an hour, {{to prevent him from}} losing his WWF Hardcore Championship. After the hour was up, the APA left, allowing Gerald Brisco to pin Holly for the Hardcore Championship. The situation resulted in Holly challenging Bradshaw in a Hardcore match, which Bradshaw won. Later that week on SmackDown!, Faarooq defeated Holly in a Hardcore match.|$|E
5|$|Public {{sentiment}} {{was against}} Rowan {{in the matter}} of his duel with Chambers. Soon after the duel, friends of Chambers formed a posse and rode toward Rowan's house. Rowan concocted a ruse whereby he dressed a family slave in his coat and hat and sent him riding from the house on horseback. <b>The</b> <b>posse</b> was fooled into thinking the slave was Rowan and gave chase, but the slave escaped and Rowan's life was spared as well. Days later, the owner of the land where the duel had taken place swore out a warrant for Rowan's arrest for murder. Some accounts hold that, as Commonwealth's Attorney, Rowan's friend Felix Grundy would have been responsible for prosecuting the case against Rowan and that Grundy resigned the position to avoid prosecuting his friend. Grundy's biographer, John Roderick Heller, admits that this was possible, although no evidence exists to confirm it. Heller also points out that Grundy was Commonwealth's Attorney not in Nelson County (the location of Bardstown), but in neighboring Washington County at the time. Joseph Hamilton Daveiss and Colonel William Allen served as counsel for Rowan. The judge opined that there was insufficient evidence to send the case to a grand jury, and Rowan was released.|$|E
