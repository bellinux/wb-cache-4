5|$|Purcell {{did not set}} any of Shakespeare's text to music; {{instead he}} {{composed}} music for short masques in every act but the first. The play itself was also slightly modernised in keeping with seventeenth-century dramatic conventions, but in the main the spoken text is as Shakespeare wrote it. The masques {{are related to the}} play metaphorically, rather than literally. Many critics have stated that <b>they</b> <b>bear</b> no relationship to the play. Recent scholarship has shown that the opera, which ends with a masque featuring Hymen, the God of Marriage, was composed for the fifteenth wedding anniversary of William III and Mary II.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevalence}} of Alzheimer's Disease in the United States {{is estimated at}} 5.1 million, and of these two thirds are women. Furthermore, women {{are far more likely}} to be the primary caregivers of adult family members with depression, so that <b>they</b> <b>bear</b> both the risks and burdens of this disease. The lifetime risk for a woman of developing Alzeimer's is twice that of men. Part of this difference may be due to life expectancy, but changing hormonal status over their lifetime may also play a par as may differences in gene expression. Deaths due to dementia are higher in women than men (4.5% of deaths vs. 2.0%).|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is an olive-brown colour. The oval to {{spindle-shaped}} spores have dimensions of 8–10 by 3.5–4.5μm. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to narrowly club-shaped, measuring 22.4–33.4 by 5.8–8.0μm. <b>They</b> <b>bear</b> four sterigmata (each holding a single spore), which {{are up to}} 6.8μm long. Cystidia are present on both the tube ends (cheilocystidia) and tube faces (pleurocystidia). There are no clamp connections in the hyphae of Suillus bovinus. The cap cuticle comprises filamentous, gelatinized hyphae with a diameter of 2.6–5.0μm. The mycelium has a pink tinge.|$|E

50|$|Ultimately, {{the season}} would end in disappointment. Despite a stellar 10-1 record, <b>they</b> <b>Bears</b> were {{bypassed}} for a BCS Bowl bid by The University of Texas. As a result, they {{played in the}} Pacific Life Holiday Bowl against a 7-4 Texas Tech squad, where Cal was upset by a score of 45-31, a disappointing end to Arrington's college career.|$|R
5|$|Copper medals {{were struck}} to commemorate {{each of the}} contestants. The obverse side of these {{contained}} {{a picture of the}} respective fighter; the reverse had the Latin inscription Bella! Horrida bella! (a quotation from Virgil which can be translated as wars, horrible wars) and the words Strength and magnanimity in the case of Perrins, and Science and intrepidity for that of Johnson. Chaloner has speculated that these may have been produced by his employers and says that <b>they</b> <b>bear</b> similarities with the work of a French die maker called Ponthon who was supplying the firm with industrial items from at least 1791. The National Portrait Gallery holds two pictures of the Banbury fight, one being an etching published by George Smeeton in 1812, and the other by Joseph Grozer in 1789.|$|E
5|$|Route 41 and County Route 573 {{continue}} {{north on}} Highland Avenue and cross into Haddonfield, {{where the road}} becomes Chews Landing Road. The two routes meet County Route 551 Spur (Kings Highway), and <b>they</b> <b>bear</b> to the right onto Kings Highway, heading northeast. They pass over New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line and the PATCO Speedline and then intersect County Route 561 (Haddon Avenue) Past CR 561, the road crosses the Cooper River into Cherry Hill Township. Route 41 and County Route 573 make a right turn onto a four-lane divided highway and intersect Route 154 (Brace Road). At this point, County Route 573 ends and Route 41 makes a left turn onto a six-lane divided highway, becoming state-maintained again and forming a concurrency with Route 154.|$|E
5|$|Since embryos {{are unknown}} in cairanoolithid eggs, the {{identity}} of their parent is uncertain. They have long been considered to be eggs of titanosaurs or ornithopods (like Rhabdodon). However, numerous characteristics distinguish Cairanoolithus from sauropod eggs (oofamilies Megaloolithidae and Faveoloolithidae), even though <b>they</b> <b>bear</b> superficial similarities in size and shape. Cairanoolithuss columnar eggshell units are quite unlike the fan-shaped ones seen in Megaloolithus, Faveoloolithus, or Fusioolithus. Also, its subdued ornamentation contrasts strongly with the heavily sculpted eggshells of sauropod eggs, {{and it has a}} different pore system. Eggs of ornithopods (Spheroolithidae and Ovaloolithidae), on the other hand, show much closer similarity to cairanoolithids in ornamentation and pore system. However, ornithopod eggs are typically much smaller, and the crystal structure of their eggshell units is distinct.|$|E

5|$|The eight {{arms are}} thick, {{tapering}} {{to a narrow}} point. They are unequal in length, with arm pair I the shortest, followed by arm pair II and arm pair IV, and arm pair III the longest. All of them possess two rows of suckers. Each sucker has a diameter less than , decreasing distally, and a ring of 17 to 28 sharp acute teeth. The left arm of pair IV in males is modified into a sexual organ known as the hectocotylus. <b>They</b> <b>bear</b> long fleshy protrusions (papillae) with toothless suckers at the distal portion. The tentacles are thick and long, extending {{the length of the}} mantle when retracted. They are slightly compressed laterally. A prominent ridge (a keel) is present on the outer surface of each of the tentacle clubs (the wide tip of the tentacles). There are four rows of suckers on the manus (proximal part of the club) and the dactylus (distal part of the club). The larger suckers in the centre of the manus have 17 to 18 widely spaced teeth.|$|E
5|$|The four lower cheekteeth—the fourth lower premolar (p4) {{and first}} through third lower molars (m1–m3)—are high-crowned teeth. Like the upper teeth, <b>they</b> <b>bear</b> four cusps (metaconid, protoconid, entoconid, and hypoconid), four lophs (metalophid, mesolophid, hypolophid, and posterolophid) and three valleys. Each {{of the lower}} cheekteeth lacks an {{additional}} loph, the ectolophid, which is present in Arikareeomys. The p4 is larger {{than any of the}} molars and longer than it is wide. Among the molars, m1 and m2 do not differ appreciably from each other and are a little wider than they are long, while m3 is a little smaller and its back side is more rounded and narrower. Syncline IV, which is located {{at the back of the}} tooth, between the hypolophid and posterolophid, is closed at the margins; this valley is open in Megapeomys bobwilsoni. Syncline IV also opens into the centrally located syncline III; this opening is absent in Arikareeomys. There are two roots under p4 and three under each of the molars, fewer than in Megapeomys bobwilsoni, which shows three under p4 and four under the molars.|$|E
5|$|The {{posterior}} thoracic {{group is}} made up of six somites, each possessing a pair of long multi-jointed appendages. The segments of these appendages are longer near the body and taper towards the flexible distal segments, extending past the carapace. <b>They</b> <b>bear</b> a fringe of long, slender filaments, all of which are directed towards the middle of the body, a characteristic shared by extant crustaceans. Though usually squashed into blade-like shapes from the fossilisation process, the filaments were slender cylindrical tubes when the animal was alive. The filaments at the tipmost segment are often bunched together. These appendages are believed to be the exopodites and may have functioned as gills and as swimming limbs. They are possibly biramous, with some specimens showing traces of what may be small endopodites at their bases.|$|E

5|$|About twenty {{teeth and}} a jaw {{fragment}} have {{been referred to}} Ferugliotherium, but the assignment {{of many of these}} is controversial or has been superseded. The upper and lower incisors are long and rodent-like and have enamel on only one side of the crown. A fragment of the lower jaw shows that the tooth socket of the lower incisor was very long, extending below the fourth premolar (p4). The p4 is preserved in this fragment. It is blade-shaped and resembles multituberculate p4s. However, the determination of this fossil as Ferugliotherium is in question. The identity of a few additional isolated premolars assigned to Ferugliotherium, some resembling multituberculates, is also uncertain. The first lower molariform (molar-like tooth; mf1) is known from four examples, of which two were originally identified as upper molars of a different species (Vucetichia gracilis), which is now considered a synonym of Ferugliotherium. <b>They</b> <b>bear</b> two longitudinal rows of three or four cusps and transverse crests and furrows. A single example each of the second lower (mf2) and first upper molariform (MF1) show that these teeth also had longitudinal cusp rows and transverse furrows and crests, but the mf2 had only two or perhaps three cusps per row and the MF1 had three longitudinal rows.|$|E
