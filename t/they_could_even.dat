5|$|In {{parallel}} storylines, Josh {{tries to}} end a deadlock on {{the appointment of a}} 6th Circuit federal court judge. His old friend Eric Hayden (Gaston) has been waiting for a year for confirmation from the Republican-led Congress, and is offered the position of dean of Georgetown's law school. But Josh suggests making a temporary recess appointment that will at least put the issue on the agenda and Hayden agrees. When Josh goes to suggest this to Leo he is told that the issue will have to wait for one of the Supreme Court justices has died. Assuming it is the ailing Chief Justice Roy Ashland that has passed, Josh is surprised to learn that it is 52-year old Justice Owen Brady, taken by a heart attack. C.J., meanwhile, tries to make things right with resurfaced college boyfriend Ben, whom she has been forced to ignore due to her workload. Based on Ben's reaction {{at the end of their}} very brief conversation, C.J. regrets her approach and fears that she may have caused things with Ben to end before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> begin. Upon voicing this concern to Toby he advices her to go to Ben and fix it. Ryan Pierce, the intern working for Josh, (uncharacteristically) fails to show up for work. Josh had failed to even notice until Donna voices her concern as she tries, unsuccessfully, to get a hold of Ryan.|$|E
25|$|The four survivors, David Kilpatrick a {{passenger}} from Paisley, Renfrewshire, William John Simpson, the 19-year-old apprentice, and nephew of the captain, and two able seamen William Mitchell and Duncan McMillan, had to scale steep cliffs before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> {{begin to get}} help. Kilpatrick was in a fearful state and could not climb up but eventually his companions helped him to the top, cutting his feet badly during the climb.|$|E
25|$|As {{reported}} by the ancient Greek mathematician Thales of Miletus around 600 BC, charge (or electricity) could be accumulated by rubbing fur on various substances, such as amber. The Greeks observed that the charged amber buttons could attract light objects such as hair. They also found that if they rubbed the amber for long enough, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> get an electric spark to jump. This property derives from the triboelectric effect.|$|E

25|$|Training {{in music}} {{has also been}} shown to improve verbal memory in {{children}} and adults. Participants trained in music and participants without a musical background were tested for immediate recall of words and recall of words after 15 minute delays. Word lists were presented orally to each participant 3 times and then participants recalled as many words as <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> <b>Even</b> when matched for intelligence, the musically trained participants tested better than non-musically trained participants. The authors of this research suggest that musical training enhances verbal memory processing due to neuroanatomical changes in the left temporal lobe, (responsible for verbal memory) which is supported by previous research. MRI has been used to show that this region of the brain is larger in musicians than non-musicians, which may be due to changes in cortical organization contributing to improved cognitive function.|$|E
25|$|The {{fluid in}} the {{internal}} compartments where corals grow their exoskeleton is also extremely important for calcification growth. When the saturation rate of aragonite in the external seawater is at ambient levels, the corals will grow their aragonite crystals rapidly in their internal compartments, hence their exoskeleton grows rapidly. If the level of aragonite in the external seawater {{is lower than the}} ambient level, the corals have to work harder to maintain the right balance {{in the internal}} compartment. When that happens, the process of growing the crystals slows down, and this slows down the rate of how much their exoskeleton is growing. Depending on how much aragonite is in the surrounding water, the corals may even stop growing because the levels of aragonite are too low to pump into the internal compartment. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> dissolve faster than they can make the crystals to their skeleton, depending on the aragonite levels in the surrounding water.|$|E
25|$|Farms were in disrepair, and the prewar {{stock of}} horses, mules and cattle was much depleted; two-fifths, or 40%, of the South's {{livestock}} had been killed. The South's farms were not highly mechanized, but {{the value of}} farm implements and machinery in the 1860 Census was $81 million and was reduced by two-fifths, or 40%, by 1870. The transportation infrastructure lay in ruins, with little railroad or riverboat service available to move crops and animals to market. Railroad mileage was located mostly in rural areas and over two-thirds of the South's rails, bridges, rail yards, repair shops and rolling stock were in areas reached by Union armies, which systematically destroyed what <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> <b>Even</b> in untouched areas, the lack of maintenance and repair, the absence of new equipment, the heavy over-use, and the deliberate relocation of equipment by the Confederates from remote areas to the war zone ensured the system would be ruined at war's end. Restoring the infrastructure—especially the railroad system—became {{a high priority for}} Reconstruction state governments.|$|E

500|$|The Klingon Bird of Prey's {{cloaking}} device {{required a}} new effect. The original concept featured {{the layers of}} the ship forming up from the inside out, requiring a series of overlaid elements filmed with an Oxberry animation camera. ILM decided the effect appeared too [...] "animated-looking", and defied common sense: [...] "if there was a fanfare to decloaking, everyone would know the Klingons were coming and blow {{them out of the}} sky before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> finish materializing," [...] Ralston said. The supervisor decided on subtlety, throwing color separations out of sync to create a blurry ripple effect. While simple, the sequence was more effective than the elaborate planned scene. Effects such as the destruction of the merchant ship were created using projected explosions, a technique perfected during the production of Return of the Jedi. Simulated zero-gravity explosions were filmed and reflected onto a card using the same motion control program used for the models. The result was an explosion that moved with the model.|$|E
500|$|Less than 15 {{hours before}} the {{scheduled}} July 2 execution, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals stayed it indefinitely and remanded the Chi Omega case for review on multiple technicalities—including Bundy's mental competency to stand trial, and an erroneous instruction by the trial judge during the penalty phase requiring the jury to break a 6–6 tie between life imprisonment and the death penalty—that, ultimately, were never resolved. A new date (November 18, 1986) was then set {{to carry out the}} Leach sentence; the Eleventh Circuit Court issued a stay on November 17. In mid-1988 the Eleventh Circuit ruled against Bundy, and in December the Supreme Court denied a motion to review the ruling. Within hours of that final denial a firm execution date of January 24, 1989 was announced. Bundy's journey through the appeals courts had been unusually rapid for a capital murder case: [...] "Contrary to popular belief, the courts moved Bundy as fast as <b>they</b> <b>could</b> ... <b>Even</b> the prosecutors acknowledged that Bundy's lawyers never employed delaying tactics. Though people everywhere seethed at the apparent delay in executing the archdemon, Ted Bundy was actually on the fast track." ...|$|E

Stephen commented that there were not [...] "many occasions when Mercedes fails to get her kit off for {{at least one of the}} lads [...] This time, Carl's the victim/lucky recipient (depending on your viewpoint) when he sets out to prove that Mercedes is a slut. Blimey. With her track record, how much proof does anyone need?" [...] Stephen commented on Mercedes and Jacqui saying that if they [...] "started charging for sex - they'd never worry about money again. It would be a busman's holiday for them. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> make it a family business - slappersRus.com". Stephen questioned whether Mercedes would [...] "get her perfect wedding" [...] and then answered, [...] "Expect gunmen/bombs/fights/ murders. Get her to the church on time, but make sure there’s a getaway car waiting, too". When Mercedes was kidnapped, Stephen said that Mercedes was [...] "very unlucky with being centre-siege". Stephen added that [...] "Still, she's been in more terrifying situations – actually, she's only been in terrifying situations. Any chance of her just enjoying a double espresso once in a while?" [...] Stephen's colleague Caroline Fitton commented on Mercedes' doubts about whether she could bring Bobby up alone saying it was [...] "entirely understandable" [...] due to Mercedes being unable to restrain from regularly [...] "changing clothes, cosmetics, jobs or men – let alone children". Stephen felt that due to Mercedes' recent behaviour she would have to chloroform her new boyfriend, adding that to Mercedes a [...] "bloke's a bloke, conscious or unconscious".|$|E

2500|$|British {{settlers}} did {{not come}} to the American colonies with the intention of creating a democratic system; yet they quickly created a broad electorate without a land-owning aristocracy, along with a pattern of free elections which put a strong emphasis on voter participation. The colonies offered a much freer degree of suffrage than England or indeed any other country. Any property owner could vote for members of the lower house of the legislature, and <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> vote for the governor in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Voters were required to hold an [...] "interest" [...] in society; as the South Carolina legislature said in 1716, [...] "it is necessary and reasonable, that none but such persons will have an interest in the Province should be capable to elect members of the Commons House of Assembly". The main legal criterion for having an [...] "interest" [...] was ownership of real estate property, which was uncommon in Britain, where 19 out of 20 men were controlled politically by their landlords. (Women, children, indentured servants, and slaves were subsumed under the interest of the family head.) London insisted on this requirement for the colonies, telling governors to exclude from the ballot men who were not freeholders—that is, those who did not own land. Nevertheless, land was so widely owned that 50% to 80% of the men were eligible to vote.|$|E
