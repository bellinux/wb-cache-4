5|$|Early in December 1900, we {{received}} from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that {{a shaft of}} light had been seen to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes. I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man {{and there is no}} reason to doubt that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>all.</b> Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means of knowing. Whether it had intelligence or not, no one can say. It is absolutely inexplicable.|$|E

They were not likely to {{live to see the}} ultimate overthrow of the capitalist system.

5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> the padding he wore.|$|E

5|$|The {{only time}} Yamato fired her main guns at enemy surface targets was in October 1944, {{when she was}} sent to engage American forces invading the Philippines during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. On the verge of success, the Japanese force turned back, believing they were {{engaging}} an entire US carrier fleet rather than a light escort carrier group <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> which stood between the battleship and vulnerable troop transports.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{computer}} power: There was {{not enough}} memory or processing speed to accomplish anything truly useful. For example, Ross Quillian's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words, because <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that would fit in memory. Hans Moravec argued in 1976 that computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence. He suggested an analogy: artificial intelligence requires computer power {{in the same way}} that aircraft require horsepower. Below a certain threshold, it's impossible, but, as power increases, eventually it could become easy. With regard to computer vision, Moravec estimated that simply matching the edge and motion detection capabilities of human retina in real time would require a general-purpose computer capable of 109 operations/second (1000 MIPS). As of 2011, practical computer vision applications require 10,000 to 1,000,000 MIPS. By comparison, the fastest supercomputer in 1976, Cray-1 (retailing at $5 million to $8 million), was only capable of around 80 to 130 MIPS, and a typical desktop computer at the time achieved less than 1 MIPS.|$|E
5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> meant out of love.|$|E

5|$|Unchained {{includes}} {{all the characters}} from the GameCube version, and four more characters — Blaze, Frost, Jax and Kitana — from Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance that are exclusive to the PlayStation Portable version. The four characters have only one Fatality and no Hara-kiri in contrast to other characters, most likely because <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> they had in Deadly Alliance. Exclusive to the Unchained version is the Endurance mode, where players can compete against a constant wave of opponents. The system's wireless ad hoc network functionality {{can be used for}} multiplayer games. Characters who remain hidden in the other versions appear unlocked by default in Unchained; producer Shaun Himmerick explained that the staff wanted to show players characters that were difficult to obtain in Deception, such as Liu Kang. Although Midway did not develop the game, they helped Just Games Interactives optimize their code and the Wi-Fi feature, as they wanted to keep the frame rate very high. Metacritic gave it an average of 70 from 14 reviews. Jeff Haynes from IGN mentioned problems with the controls and criticized the long loading times.|$|E

These manuscripts included original string quartets, sonatas, nocturnes, and other orchestral forms written by Edgar during his music conservatory days.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet {{artillery}} {{opened fire}} on the 16th Company, SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Regiment 23 Norge in the Siivertsi cemetery on 13 February, simultaneously attacking from across the ice.

This allowed the 336th Regiment with the tanks of lieutenant Otto Carius at their command to reduce the bridgehead into a smaller unit, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> the German side had strength for. The trenches, gained by Generalmajor Maximilian Wengler's 336th Regiment during the day, were retaken that night by the constantly reinforced 2nd Shock Army.|$|E

Ian Kennedy and three relievers held the Dodgers scoreless and Kershaw allowed one 2-run homer by Chris Young and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> they needed as the Diamondbacks beat the Dodgers 2–0. The team dropped to 4 games behind the Giants, their largest deficit of the season. Reliever Matt Guerrier allowed a solo homer to Jason Kubel in the 11th inning on August 31, to give the Dodgers a 4–3 loss, their eighth straight loss to the Diamondbacks on the season.|$|E
25|$|We are now {{left with}} two sons from Antonio's first {{marriage}} {{who worked in}} the family shop: Omobono and Franceso. As Omobono had left the dwelling aged eighteen in search of new employment possibilities in Naples, he left Antonio to pay for much of his living expenses. In this sense, his father had never really forgiven him for leaving home. Just as Paolo, he would inherit six violins. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that was written on the will for him. As For Francesco, who was named his father's successor, he would inherit the rest of his father's belongings, the rest of the estate. This included all of the wood tools, stencils, finished violins, patterns, not to mention, his father's reputation.|$|E

QB Russell Wilson would also record two passing touchdowns, one to Doug Baldwin and one to Jermaine Kearse. Although the Broncos would break up the shutout with a 14-yard touchdown catch by WR Demaryius Thomas, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> the scoring Denver could muster.

25|$|In Ireland, {{the delay}} in finding a {{resolution}} to the home rule issue, partly caused by the war, {{as well as the}} 1916 Easter Rising and a failed attempt to introduce conscription in Ireland, increased support for separatist radicals. This led indirectly to the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence in 1919. The creation of the Irish Free State that followed this conflict in effect represented a territorial loss for Britain <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> but equal to the loss sustained by Germany, (and furthermore, compared to Germany, a much greater loss in terms of its ratio to the country's prewar territory). Despite this, the Irish Free State remained a dominion within the British Empire.|$|E

In 1940 orders for ships from the British government, already at war with Nazi Germany, allowed for growth. Kaiser established his first Richmond shipyard beginning in December 1940, eventually building three more in Richmond; each yard with four to eight slips to build ships. Kaiser-Permanente specialized in mass-producing Liberty ships quickly and efficiently, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> they built until 1944, when they switched to the much more complicated Victory ships and built some tugs and Landing Ship, Tank (LSTs) and other specialized ships in the newly built Yard #4.|$|E
