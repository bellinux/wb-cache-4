40|$|Abstract—Low dietary sodium intake {{increases}} {{central nervous}} system angiotensin activity, which increases basal renal sympathetic nerve activity and shifts its arterial baroreflex control {{to a higher level}} of arterial pressure. This results in a higher level of renal sympathetic nerve activity for a given level of arterial pressure during low dietary sodium intake than during either normal or high dietary sodium intake, in which there is less central angiotensin activity. Peripheral <b>thermal</b> <b>receptor</b> stimulation overrides arterial baroreflex control and produces a pressor response, tachycardia, increased renal sympathetic nerve activity, and renal vasoconstriction. To test the hypothesis that increased central angiotensin activity would enhance the responses to peripheral <b>thermal</b> <b>receptor</b> stimulation, anesthetized normal rats in balance on low, normal, and high dietary sodium intake were subjected to acute peripheral <b>thermal</b> <b>receptor</b> stimulation. Low sodium rats had greater increases in renal sympathetic nerve activity, greater decreases in RBF, and greater increases in renal vascular resistance than high sodium rats. Responses of normal sodium rats were between those of low and high sodium rats. Arterial pressure and heart rate responses were not different among dietary groups. Spontaneously hypertensive rats, known to have increased {{central nervous system}} angiotensin activity, also had greater renal sympathoexcitatory and vasoconstrictor responses than normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. These results support the view that increased central nervous system angiotensin activity alters arterial baroreflex control of renal sympathetic nerve activity such that the renal sympathoexcitatory and vasoconstrictor responses to peripheral thermoreceptor stimulatio...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThrough {{encounters}} with predators, competitors, and noxious stimuli, animals have evolved defensive responses that minimize injury and {{are essential for}} survival. Physiological adaptation modulates the stimulus intensities that trigger such nocifensive behaviors, but the molecular networks that define their operating range are largely unknown. Here, we identify a gain-of-function allele of the cmk- 1 CaMKI gene in C.  elegans and show that loss of the regulatory domain of the CaMKI enzyme produces thermal analgesia and shifts the operating range for nocifensive heat avoidance to higher temperatures. Such analgesia depends on nuclear CMK- 1 signaling, while cytoplasmic CMK- 1 signaling lowers the threshold for thermal avoidance. CMK- 1 acts downstream of heat detection in <b>thermal</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons and controls neuropeptide release. Our results establish CaMKI as a key regulator of the operating range for nocifensive behaviors and suggest strategies for producing thermal analgesia through the regulation of CaMKI-dependent signaling...|$|E

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{belief that}} local cooling impairs short-term, strenuous exercise performance is controversial. Eighteen original investigations involving cooling before and intermittent cooling during short-term, intensive exercise {{are summarized in}} this review. Previous literature examining short-term intensive exercise and local cooling primarily has been limited to the effects on muscle performance immediately or within minutes following cold application. Most previous cooling studies used equal and longer than 10 minutes of pre-cooling, and found that cooling reduced strength, performance and endurance. Because short duration, high intensity exercise requires adequate warm-up to prepare for optimal performance, prolonged pre-cooling is not an effective method to prepare {{for this type of}} exercise. The literature related to the effect of acute local cooling immediately before short duration, high intensity isotonic exercise such as weight lifting is limited. However, local intermittent cooling during short-term, high intense exercise may provide possible beneficial effects; first, by pain reduction, caused by an "irritation effect" from hand <b>thermal</b> <b>receptors</b> which block pain sensation, or second, by a cooling effect, whereby stimulation of hand <b>thermal</b> <b>receptors</b> or a slight lowering of blood temperature might alter central fatigue...|$|R
40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} approach {{based on}} the hierarchical decomposition which is usually used in mechanical structure engineering is proposed. The methodology is applied to an absorption refrigeration cycle. Thus, a thermodynamic analysis of the performances on solar absorption refrigerators is presented. Under the hypothesis of an endoreversible model, {{the effects of the}} generator, the solar concentrator and the solar converter temperatures, on the coefficient of performance (COP), are presented and discussed. In fact, the coefficient of performance variations, according to the ratio of the heat transfer areas of the high temperature part (the thermal engine 2) Ah and the heat transfer areas of the low temperature part (the <b>thermal</b> <b>receptor)</b> Ar variations, are studied in this paper. For low values of the heat-transfer areas of the high temperature part and relatively important values of heat-transfer areas of the low temperature part as for example Ah equal to 30 % of Ar, the coefficient of performance is relatively important (approximately equal to 65 %). For an equal-area distribution corresponding to an area ratio Ah/Ar of 50 %, the COP is approximately equal to 35 %. The originality of this deduction is that it allows a conceptual study of the solar absorption cycle...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackground: Circadian clocks are {{synchronized}} by both light:dark {{cycles and}} by temperature fluctuations. Although {{it has long}} been known that temperature cycles can robustly entrain Drosophila locomotor rhythms, nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms involved. Results: We show here that temperature cycles induce synchronized behavioral rhythms and oscillations of the clock proteins PERIOD and TIMELESS in constant light, a situation that normally leads to molecular and behavioral arrhythmicity. We show that expression of the Drosophila clock gene period can be entrained by temperature cycles in cultured body parts and isolated brains. Further, we show that the phospholipase C encoded by the norpA gene contributes to thermal entrainment, suggesting that a receptor-coupled transduction cascade signals temperature changes to the circadian clock. We initiated the further genetic dissection of temperature-entrainment and isolated the novel Drosophila mutation nocte, which is defective in molecular and behavioral entrainment by temperature cycles but synchronizes normally to light:dark cycles. Conclusions: We conclude that temperature synchronization of the circadian clock is a tissue-autonomous process that is able to override the arrhythmia-inducing effects of constant light. Our data suggest that it involves a cell-autonomous signal-transduction cascade from a <b>thermal</b> <b>receptor</b> to the circadian clock. This process includes the function of phospholipase C and the product specified by the novel mutation nocte...|$|E
40|$|Odontoblasts produce dentin during development, {{throughout}} life, and {{in response}} to pathological conditions by sensing stimulation of exposed dentin. The functional properties and localization patterns of transient receptor potential (TRP) melastatin subfamily member 8 (TRPM 8) and ankyrin subfamily member 1 (TRPA 1) channels in odontoblasts remain to be clarified. We investigated the localization and the pharmacological, biophysical, and mechano-sensitive properties of TRPM 8 and TRPA 1 channels in rat odontoblasts. Menthol and icilin increased the intracellular free Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i). Icilin-, WS 3 -, or WS 12 -induced [Ca 2 +]i increases were inhibited by capsazepine or 5 -benzyloxytriptamine. The increase in [Ca 2 +]i elicited by allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) was inhibited by HC 030031. WS 12 and AITC exerted a desensitizing effect on [Ca 2 +]i increase. Low-temperature stimuli elicited [Ca 2 +]i increases that are sensitive to both 5 -benzyloxytriptamine and HC 030031. Hypotonic stimulation-induced membrane stretch increased [Ca 2 +]i; HC 030031 but not 5 -benzyloxytriptamine inhibited the effect. The results suggest that TRPM 8 channels in rat odontoblasts play a role in detecting low-temperature stimulation of the dentin surface and that TRPA 1 channels are involved in sensing membrane stretching and low-temperature stimulation. The results also indicate that odontoblasts act as mechanical and <b>thermal</b> <b>receptor</b> cells, detecting the stimulation o...|$|E
40|$|Central neural {{circuits}} orchestrate the homeostatic repertoire {{to maintain}} body temperature during environmental temperature challenges and to alter body temperature during the inflammatory response. This review summarizes the research {{leading to a}} model representing our current understanding of the neural pathways through which cutaneous <b>thermal</b> <b>receptors</b> alter thermoregulatory effectors: the cutaneous circulation for control of heat loss, and brown adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the heart for thermogenesis. The activation of these effectors is regulated by parallel but distinct, effector-specific core efferent pathways within {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) that share a common peripheral thermal sensory input. The thermal afferent circuit from cutaneous <b>thermal</b> <b>receptors</b> includes neurons in the spinal dorsal horn projecting to lateral parabrachial nucleus neurons that project to the medial aspect of the preoptic area. Within the preoptic area, warm-sensitive, inhibitory output neurons control heat production by reducing the discharge of thermogenesis-promoting neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus. The rostral ventromedial medulla, including the raphe pallidus, receives projections form the dorsomedial hypothalamus and contains spinally projecting premotor neurons that provide the excitatory drive to spinal circuits controlling the activity of thermogenic effectors. A distinct population of warm-sensitive preoptic neurons controls heat loss through an inhibitory input to raphe pallidus sympathetic premotor neurons controlling cutaneous vasoconstriction. The model proposed for central thermoregulatory control provides a platform for further understanding of the functional organization of central thermoregulation...|$|R

Here, we show that respiratory control in homeothermic spadices of skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus renifolius) is achieved by rate-determining biochemical reactions in which the overall thermodynamic activation energy exhibits a negative value. Moreover, NADPH production, catalyzed by mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase in a chemically endothermic reaction, {{plays a role in}} the pre-equilibrium reaction.

50|$|Viperines {{can sense}} their prey’s {{infrared}} radiation through bare nerve endings {{on the skin}} of their heads. Also, viperines and some boids have <b>thermal</b> <b>receptors</b> {{that allow them to}} target their prey’s heat. Many snakes are able to obtain their prey through constriction. This is done by first biting the prey, then coiling their body around the prey. The snake then tightens its grip as the prey struggles, which leads to suffocation. Some snakes have fangs that produce venomous bites, which allows the snake to consume unconscious, or even dead, prey. Also, some venoms include a proteolytic component that aids in digestion. Chameleons grasp their prey with a projectile tongue. This is made possible by a hyoid mechanism, which is the contraction of the hyoid muscle that drives the tip of the tongue outwards.|$|R

In these neurons, Runx 1 regulates the expression of many ion channels and receptors, in-cluding TRP class <b>thermal</b> <b>receptors,</b> Na+-gated, ATP-gated, and H+-gated channels, the opioid receptor MOR, and Mrgpr class G protein coupled receptors. Runx 1 also controls the lamina-specific innervation pattern of nociceptive afferents in the spinal cord. Moreover, mice lacking Runx 1 exhibit specific defects in thermal and neuropathic pain.

40|$|Background: Drosophila {{learn to}} avoid odors that are paired with {{aversive}} stimuli. Electric shock {{is a potent}} aversive stimulus that acts via dopamine neurons to elicit avoidance of the associated odor. While dopamine signaling has been demonstrated to mediate olfactory electric shock conditioning, it remains unclear how this pathway is involved in other types of behavioral reinforcement, such as in learned avoidance of odors paired with increased temperature. Results: To better understand the neural mechanisms of distinct aversive reinforcement signals, we here established an olfactory temperature conditioning assay comparable to olfactory electric shock conditioning. We show that the AC neurons, which are internal <b>thermal</b> <b>receptors</b> expressing dTrpA 1, are selectively required for odor-temperature but not for odor-shock memory. Furthermore, these separate sensory pathways for increased temperature and shock converge onto overlapping populations of dopamine neurons that signal aversive reinforcement. Temperature conditioning appears to require {{a subset of the}} dopamine neurons required for electric shock conditioning.

Here we investigated the thermotaxis behaviors of the bipinnaria larvae of the starfish, Patiria pectinifera, in association with TRPA ion channels that serve as <b>thermal</b> <b>receptors</b> in various animal species. Using a newly developed thermotaxis assay system, we observed that P. pectinifera larvae displayed positive thermotaxis toward high temperatures, including toward temperatures high enough to cause death. In parallel, we identified two TRPA genes, termed PpTRPA 1 and PpTRPA basal, from this species. We examined the phylogenetic position, spatial expression, and channel properties of each PpTRPA. Our results revealed the following: (1) The two genes diverged early in animal evolution; (2) PpTRPA 1 and PpTRPA basal are expressed in the ciliary band and posterior digestive tract of the larval body, respectively; and (3) PpTRPA 1 is activated by heat stimulation {{as well as by}} known TRPA 1 agonists. Moreover, knockdown and rescue experiments demonstrated that PpTRPA 1 is involved in positive thermotaxis in P. pectinifera larvae.

40|$|International audienceHuman skin is innervated with {{a variety}} of receptors serving somatosensation and {{includes}} the sensory sub-modalities of touch, temperature, pain and itch. The density and type of receptors differ across the body surface, and there are various body-map representations in the brain. The perceptions of skin sensations outside of the specified sub-modalities, e. g. wetness or greasiness, are described as 'touch blends' and are learned. The perception of wetness is generated from the coincident activation of tactile and <b>thermal</b> <b>receptors.</b> The present study aims to quantify threshold levels of wetness perception and find out if this differs across body sites. A rotary tactile stimulator was used to apply a moving, wetted stimulus over selected body sites at a precise force and velocity. Four wetness levels were tested over eight body sites. After each stimulus, the participant rated how wet the stimulus was perceived to be using a visual analogue scale. The results indicated that participants discriminated between levels of wetness as distinct percepts. Significant differences were found between all levels of wetness, apart from the lowest levels of comparison (20 l and 40 l). The perception of wetness did not, however, differ significantly across body sites and there were no significant interactions between wetness level and body site.

This suggested a third detection mechanism; fat may be detected via its effect on the thermal conductivity of the food.

40|$|Thermogenesis, the {{production}} of heat energy, is {{an essential component of}} the homeostatic repertoire to maintain body temperature during the challenge of low environmental temperature and {{plays a key role in}} elevating body temperature during the febrile response to infection. Mitochondrial oxidation in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a significant source of neurally regulated metabolic heat production in many species from mouse to man. BAT thermogenesis is regulated by neural networks in the central nervous system which responds to feedforward afferent signals from cutaneous and core body thermoreceptors and to feedback signals from brain thermosensitive neurons to activate BAT sympathetic nerve activity. This review summarizes the research leading to a model of the feedforward reflex pathway through which environmental cold stimulates BAT thermogenesis and includes the influence on this thermoregulatory network of the pyrogenic mediator, prostaglandin E 2, to increase body temperature during fever. The cold thermal afferent circuit from cutaneous <b>thermal</b> <b>receptors,</b> through second-order thermosensory neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord ascends to activate neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus which drive GABAergic interneurons in the preoptic area (POA) to inhibit warm-sensitive, inhibitory output neurons of the POA. The resulting disinhibition of BAT thermogenesis-promoting neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus activates BAT sympathetic premotor neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla, including the rostral raphe pallidus, which provide excitatory, and possibly disinhibitory, inputs to spinal sympathetic circuits to drive BAT thermogenesis.

50|$|In most cases, as {{the body}} is exposed to {{physical}} activity, the core temperature of the body tends to rise as heat gain becomes larger than the amount of heat lost. “The {{factors that contribute to}} heat gain during exercise include anything that stimulate metabolic rate, anything from the external environment that causes heat gain, and the ability of the body to dissipate heat under any given set of circumstances”. In response to an increase in core temperature, {{there are a variety of}} factors which adapt in order to help restore heat balance. The main physiological response to an increase in body temperature is mediated by the thermal regulatory center located in the hypothalamus of the brain which connects to <b>thermal</b> <b>receptors</b> and effectors. There are numerous thermal effectors including sweat glands, smooth muscles of blood vessels, some endocrine glands, and skeletal muscle. With an increase in the core temperature, the thermal regulatory center will stimulate the arterioles supplying blood to the skin to dilate along with the release of sweat on the skin surface to reduce temperature through evaporation. In addition to the involuntary regulation of temperature, the hypothalamus is able to communicate with the cerebral cortex to initiate voluntary control such as removing clothing or drinking cold water. With all regulations taken into account, the body is able to maintain core temperature within about two or three degrees Celsius during exercise.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to estimate and compare nerve conduction velocity (NCV) of cutaneous heat-sensitive C-fibres obtained using two methods. The first is a method based on reaction times to different rates of temperature change produced by a large contact thermode (Thermotest). The second is a novel method based on ultra-late-evoked brain potentials to CO 2 laser stimuli with tiny beam sections (< 0. 25 mm 2), allowing selective and direct activation of very slow conducting afferents. Both methods were applied on three sites of the right leg (foot, knee and thigh) of ten healthy subjects. When based on the reaction times to contact heat, NCV estimations were 0. 4 +/- 0. 22 m/s for the proximal segment (knee-thigh) and 0. 6 +/- 0. 23 m/s for the distal segment (foot-knee). When based on the difference in latency of the ultra-late positivity of laser-evoked brain potentials, NCV estimations were respectively 1. 4 +/- 0. 77 m/s and 1. 2 +/- 0. 55 m/s. For both methods, the difference in NCV between proximal and distal limb segments was not significant. Although both methods give NCV estimations within the range of C-fibres, the systematic difference between NCV obtained from each method may result from the activation of subpopulations of C-fibres with different NCV depending on the method of stimulation (low-threshold <b>thermal</b> <b>receptors</b> by the thermode and thermal nociceptors by the CO 2 laser).

Changing this region both transformed temperature-insensitive isoforms into temperature-sensitive channels and significantly perturbed temperature sensing in temperature-sensitive wild-type channels.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionAthletes are {{permanently}} {{exposed to}} {{or in the}} state of transient thermal conditions, because of their own varying metabolic output or environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind velocity and radiation. This causes thermal stress, discomfort and even inhibits performance. The human body constantly regulates its internal temperature receiving neuronal signals from <b>thermal</b> <b>receptors</b> in the skin. Both warm and cold receptors have static and dynamic responses to thermal transitions in the environment. The latter occurs at sudden thermal changes that lead to peak the receptors firing rate. It is well known how humans thermally perceive transient thermal conditions due to starting temperature, temperature gradient {{and the size of the}} skin surface area. Not known is their comfort response to quick environmental changes. Therefore this study investigates local comfort response of sudden thermal changes, whether they can improve thermal comfort and imply useful applications for hot or cold environments in sports. MethodologyEight healthy, male subjects were exposed to three warm and cold environments in standardized clothing. After 20 minutes of acclimatization nine body parts were locally treated with cool and warm convection to trigger peak receptor responses (“overshoot”). Local skin temperatures were measured and subjects were asked about their thermal comfort and perception. ResultsResults show highly significant global comfort improvement by local overshoot in both environments (p=. 00, α=. 01) at every body part. Furthermore results show tendencies for major impact on comfort of core body parts. ConclusionTo sum up this research found the possibility for temporal local treatment as highly efficient for significant comfort improvement. For instance local heating via technical textiles can improve comfort in harsh skiing conditions or local cooling can do the same in extreme heat. Nonetheless further research is needed to quantify physiological impacts of temporal local treatments for further implications e. g. on sports performance as well as possibilities of technical realizations...|$|R

We also measured afferent conduction velocity and, with source analysis, studied the brain generators. Whereas laser pulses of low intensity and small irradiated area elicited pinprick sensations and standard Ad- LEPs, laser pulses of very-low intensity and large irradiated area elicited warmth sensations and scalp potentials with a latency compatible with C-®bre conduction (negative wave 280 ms, positive wave 380 ms); the estimated conduction velocity was 1. 2 m/s. The main waves of the scalp potentials originated from the anterior cingulate gyrus; they were preceded by activity in the opercular region and followed by activity in the insular region. The patient with bilateral facial palsy, who had absent trigeminal-facial re¯exes, had normal Ad- and C-related scalp potentials; the patients with trigeminal neuropathy, characterized by loss of myelinated and sparing of unmyelinated ®bres, had absent Ad- but normal C-related potentials; and the patients with Wallenberg syndrome had absent Ad- and C-related potentials. We conclude that laser pulses with appropriate characteristics evoke brain potentials related to the selective activation of trigeminal nociceptive Ad or thermal C ®bres.

To understand the perception of temperature and the general thermal state of the human body, the first aspect of this dissertation focuses on investigating the interaction between temperature change and perception on a large scale. Three field surveys were conducted inside airconditioned buildings to investigate the change in the thermal state and temperature perception of occupants when the room temperature changes. The results showed that the participants’ prediction of constant operating temperature was poor, however, their prediction was significantly improved when temperature changes were presented. In order to more accurately investigate the perception of temperature on the skin, a new thermal display method using multiple-channel thermal actuators was developed. The principle of this method is to apply slow and fast rates of temperature change simultaneously on the skin. The slowly changing temperatures are below the perceptual threshold of the <b>thermal</b> <b>receptors,</b> therefore will not be detected whereas the quickly changing temperatures are above the perceptual threshold, hence, will be detected. The idea here is to keep the average surface temperature of the skin constant, however a person will perceive a sensation of continuous cooling. This method was tested through a series of experiments, and the results showed that it is capable of generating a continuous cooling sensation without changing the average temperature of the stimulation area. Multiple variations of this method were tested including different heating and cooling rates of change, different skin locations and patterns of stimuli. Also, a continuous warming was generated using similar concept. To further investigate the temperature distribution that is caused by this method and its effect on the skin, a computational simulation was conducted. An approximate model of the skin was used to monitor its surface temperature and record the temperatures in the stimulation area when the continuous cooling method is applied. The results of the simulation showed that the temperature under the surface of the stimulation area was affected by the continuous cooling method that was applied on the skin model, however this method did not affect the average surface temperature of the skin. These findings may later determine the efficiency and intensity of the method of continuous cooling, and allow us to investigate different technically challenging variations of this method...|$|R
40|$|Genital herpes is {{a painful}} disease {{frequently}} {{caused by the}} neurotropic pathogen herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2). We have recently shown that HSV- 2 -secreted glycoprotein G (SgG 2) interacts with and modulates {{the activity of the}} neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF). This interaction modifies the response of the NGF receptor TrkA, increasing NGF-dependent axonal growth. NGF is not only an axonal growth modulator but also an important mediator of pain and inflammation regulating the amount, localization, and activation of the <b>thermal</b> pain <b>receptor</b> transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1). In this work, we addressed whether SgG 2 could contribute to HSV- 2 -induced pain. Injection of SgG 2 in the mouse hindpaw produced a rapid and transient increase in thermal pain sensitivity. At the molecular level, this acute increase in thermal pain induced by SgG 2 injection was dependent on differential NGF-induced phosphorylation and in changes in the amount of TrkA and TRPV 1 in the dermis. These results suggest that SgG 2 alters thermal pain sensitivity by modulating TRPV 1 receptor.

The objective {{of this study was}} to use a physical method in an attempt to characterize the molecular nature of drug receptors in situ. The isolated rat stomach fundus strip was heated at various temperatures for various times. Dose-response curves to KC 1 and a number of receptor agonists were determined before and after heating. The experimental dose-response data were obtained after reequilibrating the tissue at the control temperature (37. 5 ’C). Optimal conditions for achieving differential thermal effects were 47 ’C for 20 mm. KC 1 -induced contractions were unaffected, as were those to acetylcholine and bradykinin. A marked decrease in slope of the serotonin dose-response curve was produced. Although the maximum contraction height could be attained, this required a 1250 -fold higher concentra-tion than the control. Dose-response curves to angiotensin and vasopressin were affected to the greatest degree, showing a marked decrease in slope and a greatly depressed maximum contraction height. The simplest interpretation for the depressed responses is that hea...|$|R
5000|$|NK1 agonism induced {{hypersensitivity}} {{is dependent}} on 5-HT3 receptors, and modulated by GABAA and NMDA receptors as well. Animals were pretreated with spinally administered Y-25130 or ondansetron, both 5-HT3 antagonists, before having RVM injections of SP. Both Y-25130 and ondansetron inhibited SP-induced <b>thermal</b> hyperalgesia. GABAA <b>receptor</b> involvement was demonstrated by intrathecal administration of gabazine, a GABAA antagonist, in animals receiving continuous infusions of SP into the RVM. Gabazine treatment completely reversed the thermal hyperalgesia. The mechanism behind GABA involvement was investigated using in vitro recordings from animals treated with continuous infusions of SP or saline into the RVM. In SP-treated neurons, GABA evoked depolarization, whereas, in saline-treated neurons, it caused hyperpolarization. [...] "These results suggest that descending facilitation induced by RVM SP administration produces GABAA receptor-evoked depolarization {{and an increase in}} excitation of dorsal horn neurons." [...] Next, the GABA A agonist muscimol was tested in conjuncture with SP. Intrathecal muscimol significantly enhanced SP-induced hypersensitivity, which was blocked by intrathecal gabazine. Next, the researchers looked at threonine phosphorylation of NKCC1 proteins, which are an isoform of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter. Phosphorylation of these proteins results in increase activity of the cotransporter. Chronic administration of RVM SP or acute SP combined with intrathecal muscimol resulted in significantly higher levels of phosphorylated NKCC1.|$|R
40|$|Dairy fermentations {{constitute}} a perfect “breeding ground” for bacteriophages infecting starter cultures, particularly strains of Lactococcus lactis. In modern fermentations, these phages typically belong {{to one of}} three groups, i. e., the 936, P 335, and c 2 phage groups. Traditional production methods present fewer chemical and physical barriers to phage proliferation compared to modern production systems, while the starter cultures used are typically complex, variable, and undefined. In the current study, a variety of cheese whey, animal-derived rennet, and vat swab samples from artisanal cheeses produced in Sicily were analysed for the presence of lactococcal phages to assess phage diversity in such environments. The complete genomes of 18 representative phage isolates were sequenced, allowing the identification of 10 lactococcal 949 group phages, six P 087 group phages, and two members of the 936 group phages. The genetic diversity of these isolates was examined using phylogenetic analysis as well as a focused analysis of the receptor binding proteins, which dictate specific interactions with the host-encoded <b>receptor.</b> <b>Thermal</b> treatments at 63 °C and 83 °C indicate that the 949 phages are particularly sensitive to thermal treatments, followed by the P 087 and 936 isolates, which were shown to be much less sensitive to such treatments. This difference may explain the relatively low frequency of isolation of the so-called “rare” 949 and P 087 group phages in modern fermentations...|$|R
40|$|Mitogen-activated {{normal human}} {{peripheral}} blood lymphocytes bind transferrin to specific membrane receptors. In this study, lymphocytes stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin for 0 - 66 hr were examined {{to determine the}} relation of this phenomenon to cellular activation and related metabolic events. Transferrin receptors were first detected at 20 - 24 hr. This event was consistently preceded by RNA and protein turnover which commenced during the first 6 hr of culture, whereas initiation of DNA synthesis was detected concurrently {{with the appearance of}} receptors or slightly later (24 - 30 hr). Exposure of cells to inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis early during culture (at 0 or 24 hr) prevented the expression of transferrin receptors, but also caused generalized metabolic failure, and abrogated cellular activation. In contrast, later addition of these agents at 48 hr did not interfere significantly with the process of activation, but did suppress the terminal increase in receptor-bearing cells observed during the final 18 hr in control cultures lacking inhibitor. After deliberate <b>thermal</b> stripping of <b>receptors</b> from activated cells, the reappearance of membrance binding sites which normally occurred within 30 min, was also blocked by cycloheximide, puromycin and actinomycin D. However, similar inhibition of DNA which was induced by hydroxyurea had much less effect upon both the initial appearance of receptors and their reappearance after ligand-induced depletion. These results demonstrate that the appearance of transferrin receptors upon human lymphocytes is dependent upon cellular activation and requires synthesis of protein and RNA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Antidepressants, {{which are}} widely used for {{treatment}} of chronic pain, {{are thought to have}} antinociceptive effects by blockade of serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake. However, these drugs also interact with various receptors such as excitatory glutamatergic <b>receptors.</b> <b>Thermal</b> hyperalgesia was induced by intrathecal injection of NMDA in rats. Paw withdrawal latency was measured after intrathecal injection of antidepressants. The effects of antidepressants on the NMDA and AMPA-induced responses were examined in lamina II neurons of rat spinal cord slices using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The effects of milnacipran followed by application of NMDA on pERK activation were also investigated in the spinal cord. Results Intrathecal injection of milnacipran (0. 1 [*]μmol), but not citalopram (0. 1 [*]μmol) and desipramine (0. 1 [*]μmol), followed by intrathecal injection of NMDA (1 [*]μg) suppressed thermal hyperalgesia. Milnacipran (100 μM) reduced the amplitude of NMDA (56 [*]±[*] 3 [*]%, 64 [*]±[*] 5 [*]% of control) -, but not AMPA (98 [*]±[*] 5 [*]%, 97 [*]±[*] 5 [*]% of control) -mediated currents induced by exogenous application and dorsal root stimulation, respectively. Citalopram (100 μM) and desipramine (30 μM) had no effect on the amplitude of exogenous NMDA-induced currents. The number of pERK-positive neurons in the group treated with milnacipran (100 μM), but not citalopram (100 μM) or desipramine (30 μM), followed by NMDA (100 μM) was significantly lower compared with the NMDA-alone group. Conclusions The antinociceptive effect of milnacipran may be dependent on the drug’s direct modulation of NMDA receptors in the superficial dorsal horn. Furthermore, in addition to inhibiting the reuptake of monoamines, glutamate NMDA receptors are also important for analgesia induced by milnacipran. </p...|$|R
