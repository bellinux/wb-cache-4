50|$|Airbreathing {{approaches}} use the air during ascent for propulsion. The {{most commonly}} proposed {{approach is the}} scramjet, but <b>turborocket,</b> Liquid Air Cycle Engine (LACE) and precooled jet engines have also been proposed.|$|E
50|$|Air turborockets {{are often}} {{referred}} to as turboramjets, turboramjet rockets, <b>turborocket</b> expanders, and many others. As there is no consensus on which names apply to which specific concepts, various sources may use the same name for two different concepts.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of air <b>turborockets.</b> The various types generally differ in how the gas generator section of the engine functions.|$|R
40|$|An engine {{simulation}} {{computer code}} called NNEP 89 was written to perform 1 -D steady state thermodynamic analysis of turbine engine cycles. By using a very flexible method of input, {{a set of}} standard components are connected at execution time to simulate almost any turbine engine configuration that the user could imagine. The code was used to simulate {{a wide range of}} engine cycles from turboshafts and turboprops to air <b>turborockets</b> and supersonic cruise variable cycle engines. Off design performance is calculated through the use of component performance maps. A chemical equilibrium model is incorporated to adequately predict chemical dissociation as well as model virtually any fuel. NNEP 89 is written in standard FORTRAN 77 with clear structured programming and extensive internal documentation. The standard FORTRAN 77 programming allows it to be installed onto most mainframe computers and workstations without modification. The NNEP 89 code was derived from the Navy/NASA Engine program (NNEP). NNEP 89 provides many improvements and enhancements to the original NNEP code and incorporates features which make it easier to use for the novice user. This is a comprehensive user's guide for the NNEP 89 code...|$|R
50|$|The <b>turborocket</b> design {{offers a}} mixture of {{benefits}} with drawbacks. It is not a true rocket, so it cannot operate in space. Cooling the engine {{is not a problem}} because the burner and its hot exhaust gases are located behind the turbine blades.|$|E
50|$|Once a {{jet engine}} goes high enough in an atmosphere, there is {{insufficient}} oxygen {{to burn the}} jet fuel. The idea behind a <b>turborocket</b> is to supplement the atmospheric oxygen with an onboard supply. This allows operation {{at a much higher}} altitude than a normal engine would allow.|$|E
50|$|The air <b>turborocket</b> {{is a form}} of combined-cycle jet engine. The basic layout {{includes}} a gas generator, which produces high pressure gas, that drives a turbine/compressor assembly which compresses atmospheric air into a combustion chamber. This mixture is then combusted before leaving the device through a nozzle and creating thrust.|$|E
50|$|In {{applications}} which stay relatively in {{the atmosphere}} and require longer durations of lower thrust over a specific speed range the air <b>turborocket</b> can have a weight advantage over the standard solid fuel rocket motor. In terms of volumetric requirements, the rocket motor has the advantage {{due to the lack}} of inlet ducts and other air management devices.|$|E
50|$|A <b>turborocket</b> {{is a type}} of {{aircraft}} engine combining elements of a jet engine and a rocket. It typically comprises a multi-stage fan driven by a turbine, which is driven by the hot gases exhausting from a series of small rocket-like motors mounted around the turbine inlet. The turbine exhaust gases mix with the fan discharge air, and combust with the air from the compressor before exhausting through a convergent-divergent propelling nozzle.|$|E
50|$|The {{benefit of}} this setup is {{increased}} specific impulse over {{that of a}} rocket. For the same mass of fuel as a rocket motor, the overall output of the air <b>turborocket</b> is much higher. In addition, it provides thrust throughout a much wider speed range than a ramjet, yet is much cheaper and easier to control than a gas turbine engine. The air-turborocket fills a niche (in terms of cost, reliability, ruggedness, and duration of thrust) between the solid-fuel rocket motor and gas turbine engine for missile applications.|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{performance of}} several TBCC engines is investigated from Mach 0 - 5. The primary {{objective of this}} research is the direct comparison of several TBCC engine concepts, ultimately determining the most suitable option for the first stage of a two-state-to-orbit launch vehicle. TBCC performance models are developed and optimized. A hybrid optimizer is developed, combining the global accuracy of probabilistic optimization with the local efficiency of gradient-based optimization. Trade studies are performed to determine the sensitivity of TBCC performance to various design variables and engine parameters. The optimization is quite effective, producing results with less than 1 % error from optimizer repeatability. The turbine-bypass engine (TBE) provides superior specific impulse performance. The hydrocarbon-fueled gas-generator air <b>turborocket</b> and hydrogen-fueled expander-cycle air <b>turborocket</b> are also competitive because they may provide greater thrust-to-weight than the TBE, but require some engineering problems to be addressed before being fully developed...|$|E
40|$|A {{concept is}} shown for a fully reusable, earth to orbit launch vehicle with {{horizontal}} takeoff and landing, employing an air-turborocket for low speed and a rocket for high speed acceleration, both using LH 2 fuel. The <b>turborocket</b> employs a modified liquid air cycle {{to supply the}} oxidizer. The rocket uses 90 percent pure LOX that is collected from the atmosphere, separated, and stored during operation of the <b>turborocket</b> from about Mach 2 to Mach 5 or 6. The takeoff weight and the thrust required at takeoff are markedly reduced by collecting the rocket oxidizer in-flight. The paper shows an approach and the corresponding technology needs for using ALES propulsion in a SSTO vehicle. Reducing the trajectory altitude {{at the end of}} collection reduces the wing area and increases payload. The use of state-of-the-art materials, such as graphite polyimide, is critical to meet the structure weight objective for SSTO. Configurations that utilize 'waverider' aerodynamics show great promise to reduce the vehicle weight...|$|E
40|$|The Air Force and NASA share {{a common}} {{interest}} in developing advanced propulsion systems for commercial and military aerospace vehicles which require efficient acceleration and cruise operation in the Mach 4 to 6 flight regime. The principle engine of interest is the turboramjet; however, other combined cycles such as the turboscramjet, air <b>turborocket,</b> supercharged ejector ramjet, ejector ramjet, and air liquefaction based propulsion are also of interest. Over the past months careful planning and program implementation {{have resulted in a}} number of development efforts that will lead to a broad technology base for those combined cycle propulsion systems. Individual development programs are underway in thermal management, controls materials, endothermic hydrocarbon fuels, air intake systems, nozzle exhaust systems, gas turbines and ramjet ramburners...|$|E
40|$|Propulsion, while {{conventionally}} {{included on}} the list of important aeronautical disciplines along with aerodynamics, structures, etc., is in itself a systems endeavor, analogous to the engineering of the entire vehicle; indeed propulsion encompasses important aspects of all the other disciplines. In recognition of this fact, the panel focused its discussion on those aspects of the key disciplines that are especially or uniquely important to propulsion. From the initial development of the airplane, the propulsion system has been {{recognized as one of the}} pacing technologies. It is perhaps because of the technological disparity between the reciprocating engine and the primitive airframe that the two remained relatively and separate, were developed somewhat independently, usually by different organizations. In recent years, the maturing of the gas turbine power plant and the advance in high-speed airframes have rendered this separation somewhat artificial. The power plant and the airframe now share common structural and aerodynamic elements; as the flight Mach number rises, the degree of interaction increases. By the year 2000, this interdependence will have increased in many respects to a point where independent design may not be practical or possible. During the period since the initiation of the aircraft gas turbine, the solid propellant rocket and the liquid propellant rocket, a vast array of other novel engines have been studied, covering the full spectrum of flight conditions from low subsonic to hypersonic and transatmospheric flight. In each instance, performance limits have been investigated under the assumption that current technology or reasonably foreseeable technology would be available for their development. Among the extensive list of advanced, high-performance concepts and cycles examined are the hypersonic ramjet, the variable cycle, runway-to-orbit airbreathing engine, the ram rocket (airbreathing and rich solid propellant rocket), and the air <b>turborocket.</b> At various times, these systems have come relatively close to meriting development and application. In many instances, limitations of materials and technologies curtailed development. As important and with almost equal frequency, the lack of commercial or military utility of the concept precluded the necessary funding. It is instructive to note that two former items on this list, the turbofan (bypass engine) and the high-speed turboprop, are respectively a mainstay engine and a promising development. In the case of the turbofan, its full potential could not be realized until turbine cooling technology had been developed and new materials developed to permit the construction of transonic fans. In the case of the highspeed turbopropeller engine, not only were the material and turbine technologies needed, but, in addition, the rise in fuel costs provided the impetus to take advantage of its favorable fuel consumption characteristic. As the basic technologies progress and as new missions become attractive, the engines in the foregoing list become candidates for new feasibility studies and further technology development. At the present time, the ram rocket is the prime contender to augment the range of small missiles. Of interest also is the hypersonic ram jet and its logical extension, the runway-to-orbit airbreathing engine. Much of this report deals with the development of current or near-future power plant concepts. First, the motivating factors for aeronautical propulsion research are reviewed as a reminder of the importance of continued effort in a field that has often been characterized as mature. Next, technical areas are discussed in which the panel feels additional research effort is warranted and would lead to the realization of the technological potentials between now and the year 2000. Under these guidelines, new cycles (e. g., isothermal energy exchange) were not considered by the panel. Finally, although facility requirements were not a prime consideration in the current projections, the panel believes that the increasing complexity of propulsion systems; the need for more refined interaction between propulsion system, airframe, and controls; and increasing operation in adverse weather will require test capabilities beyond those now available (see appendix). Enhanced test capability is needed in the areas of propulsion airframe integration and in largescale icing research with proper concurrent treatment of altitude, temperature, and speed...|$|E
