25|$|Caffeine {{constitutes}} about 3% of tea's dry weight, translating {{to between}} 30mg and 90mg per 8-oz (250-ml) cup depending on type, brand, and brewing method. A {{study found that}} <b>the</b> <b>caffeine</b> content of 1g of black tea ranged from 22 to 28mg, while <b>the</b> <b>caffeine</b> content of 1g of green tea ranged from 11 to 20mg, reflecting a significant difference.|$|E
25|$|Water extraction: Coffee {{beans are}} soaked in water. The water, which {{contains}} many other compounds {{in addition to}} caffeine and contributes to the flavor of coffee, is then passed through activated charcoal, which removes <b>the</b> <b>caffeine.</b> The water can then be put back with the beans and evaporated dry, leaving decaffeinated coffee with its original flavor. Coffee manufacturers recover <b>the</b> <b>caffeine</b> and resell it for use in soft drinks and over-the-counter caffeine tablets.|$|E
40|$|Caffeine and {{nicotine}} {{are some}} of the most often self-administered substances worldwide. Very often they are taken simultaneously and it seems that this fact is correlated with <b>the</b> amount of <b>caffeine</b> and nicotine administered. The aim of this study is to determine, whether tobacco smoke influences <b>the</b> metabolism of <b>caffeine.</b> <b>The</b> secondary task is to establish whether caffeine has an effect on elimination of cotinine, nicotine’s main metabolite. The results showed that tobacco smoke influences <b>the</b> metabolism of <b>caffeine</b> by accelerating its elimination, by the means of induced CYP 1 A 2 activity. As far as cotinine is concerned, no influence of caffeine on its elimination was observed...|$|R
30|$|The primary aim of {{this work}} was the {{development}} of an integral methodology to determine <b>the</b> concentration of <b>caffeine</b> in surface and wastewater and evaluate the removal efficiencies of caffeine in two WWTPs in Barbados. These data are compared to results collected around the world. The secondary aims of the paper are to evaluate <b>the</b> sources of <b>caffeine</b> in surface water, whether natural or anthropogenic and assess <b>the</b> stability of <b>caffeine</b> in aqueous solutions.|$|R
50|$|His {{chemical}} work included purine chemistry, <b>the</b> {{identification of}} <b>caffeine,</b> <b>the</b> first coal tar dye (aniline blue), coal tar products (and {{a large number}} of substances that derive from coal tar), paper chromatography, pyrrole, chinoline, phenol, thymol and atropine.|$|R
25|$|Depending on {{the type}} of coffee and method of preparation, <b>the</b> <b>caffeine</b> content of a single serving can vary greatly.|$|E
25|$|Coffea arabica {{normally}} {{contains about}} half <b>the</b> <b>caffeine</b> of Coffea robusta. A Coffea arabica bean containing very little caffeine {{was discovered in}} Ethiopia in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Ceaseless Juncture and <b>The</b> <b>Caffeine</b> Effect {{are some}} of the exiting active bands. There were bands like Avalanche, Auxiliary Triangle, Assault, Overdrive, Blindfolds which are now disbanded, but won {{competitions}} outside the city.|$|E

25|$|Because {{caffeine}} is both water- and lipid-soluble, it readily {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier {{that separates the}} bloodstream from {{the interior of the}} brain. Once in the brain, the principal mode of action is as a nonselective antagonist of adenosine receptors (in other words, an agent that reduces the effects of adenosine). <b>The</b> <b>caffeine</b> molecule is structurally similar to adenosine, and is capable of binding to adenosine receptors on the surface of cells without activating them, thereby acting as a competitive antagonist.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine is also {{a common}} {{ingredient}} of soft drinks, such as cola, originally prepared from kola nuts. Soft drinks typically contain 0 to 55 milligrams of caffeine per 12 ounce serving. By contrast, energy drinks, such as Red Bull, can start at 80 milligrams of caffeine per serving. <b>The</b> <b>caffeine</b> in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of decaffeination or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of theobromine and theophylline in a naturally occurring slow-release excipient.|$|E
25|$|Viennese cafés have an {{extremely}} long and distinguished history {{that dates back}} centuries, and <b>the</b> <b>caffeine</b> addictions of some famous historical patrons of the oldest are something of a local legend. These coffee houses are unique to Vienna and many cities have unsuccessfully sought to copy them. Some people consider cafés as their extended living room where nobody will be bothered if they spend hours reading a newspaper while enjoying their coffee. Traditionally, the coffee comes {{with a glass of}} water. Viennese cafés claim to have invented the process of filtering coffee from booty captured after the second Turkish siege in 1683. Viennese cafés claim that when the invading Turks left Vienna, they abandoned hundreds of sacks of coffee beans. The Polish King John III Sobieski, the commander of the anti-Turkish coalition of Poles, Germans, and Austrians, gave Franz George Kolschitzky (Polish – Franciszek Jerzy Kulczycki) some of this coffee as a reward for providing information that allowed him to defeat the Turks. Kolschitzky then opened Vienna's first coffee shop. Julius Meinl set up a modern roasting plant in the same premises where the coffee sacks were found, in 1891.|$|E
50|$|Propyphenazone/paracetamol/caffeine (trade name Saridon) is an {{analgesic}} combination indicated for {{the management}} of headache. It contains the analgesics propyphenazone and paracetamol and <b>the</b> stimulant <b>caffeine.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Cisplatin is an {{important}} DNA-damaging anticancer drug {{that has been used}} to treat many cancer types. However, the effectiveness of cisplatin treatment diminishes quickly as cancer cells develop resistance to the drug, which eventually results in treatment failure. Caffeine is an ingredient contained in many food sources. Caffeine can inhibit activities of both ATM and ATR, two important protein kinases involved in DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. <b>The</b> effect of <b>caffeine</b> on cisplatin-based cancer treatment is not well known. Methods: Caspase- 3 activation and cell growth inhibition assays were used to determine <b>the</b> effect of <b>caffeine</b> on cisplatin-induced apoptosis and cell growth in lung cancer cells. Real time PCR, immunoblotting, and flow cytometry assays were used determine a mechanism through which <b>the</b> presence of <b>caffeine</b> increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis of the lung cancer cells. Results: Our caspase- 3 activation studies demonstrated that <b>the</b> presence of <b>caffeine</b> increased <b>the</b> cisplatin-induced apoptosis in both HTB 182 and CRL 5985 lung cancer cells. Our cell growth inhibition studies indicated that <b>the</b> presence of <b>caffeine</b> caused a more increase for cisplatin-induced cell growth inhibition. The results obtained from our real time PCR and western blot studies revealed that <b>the</b> presence of <b>caffeine</b> increased cisplatin-induced expression of the PUMA pro-apoptotic protein in these lung cancer cells. The results of our protein phosphorylation studies indicated that <b>the</b> presence of <b>caffeine</b> caused a decrease in CHK 1 phosphorylation at Ser 317 /Ser 345 but an increase in ATM phosphorylation at Ser 1981 in the lung cancer cells treated with cisplatin. In addition, our flow cytometry studies also revealed that <b>the</b> presence of <b>caffeine</b> caused an increase in G 1 cell population but a decrease for cisplatin-induced cell cycle arrests at the S and the G 2 checkpoints in HTB 182 and CRL 5985 cells respectively. Conclusion: Our results suggest that <b>the</b> presence of <b>caffeine</b> increases <b>the</b> cisplatin-induced lung cancer cell killings by inhibiting ATR but inducing ATM activation, resulting in an increase in expression of PUMA protein and an increase in apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|In a {{study of}} {{caffeine}} and its metabolites in pregnant and non-pregnant women, on average 56. 8 % of <b>the</b> administered <b>caffeine</b> dose was recovered in the urine in both groups. However, compared to the controls, the pregnant subjects produced smaller amounts of 1 -methylxanthine and 1 -methyluric acid, whereas the excretion {{of most of the}} other metabolites, particularly 3, 7 -dimethylxanthine and 3 -methylxanthine tended to be greater. It is suggested that hormonal influences on <b>the</b> hepatic <b>caffeine</b> metabolising enzymes might be implicated...|$|R
25|$|Coffee may be brewed by {{steeping}} in {{a device}} {{such as a}} French press (also known as a cafetière, coffee press or coffee plunger). Ground coffee and hot water are combined in a cylindrical vessel and left to brew for a few minutes. A circular filter which fits tightly in the cylinder fixed to a plunger is then pushed {{down from the top}} to force the grounds to the bottom. The filter retains the grounds at the bottom as the coffee is poured from the container. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the water, all the coffee oils remain in the liquid, making it a stronger beverage. This method of brewing leaves more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine. Supporters of the French press method point out that the sediment issue can be minimized by using the right type of grinder: they claim that a rotary blade grinder cuts the coffee bean into a wide range of sizes, including a fine coffee dust that remains as sludge {{at the bottom of the}} cup, while a burr grinder uniformly grinds the beans into consistently-sized grinds, allowing the coffee to settle uniformly and be trapped by the press. Within the first minute of brewing 95% of <b>the</b> <b>caffeine</b> is released from the coffee bean.|$|E
25|$|Parrots may {{not make}} good pets for most people because of their natural wild {{instincts}} such as screaming and chewing. Although parrots can be very affectionate and cute when immature, they often become aggressive when mature (partly due to mishandling and poor training) and may bite, causing serious injury. For this reason, parrot rescue groups estimate that most parrots are surrendered and rehomed through at least five homes before reaching their permanent destinations or before dying prematurely from unintentional or intentional neglect and abuse. The parrots' ability to mimic human words and their bright colours and beauty prompt impulse buying from unsuspecting consumers. The domesticated budgerigar, a small parrot, {{is the most popular}} of all pet bird species. In 1992, the newspaper USA Today published that 11 million pet birds were in the United States alone, many of them parrots. Europeans kept birds matching the description of the rose-ringed parakeet (or called the ring-necked parrot), documented particularly in a first-century account by Pliny the Elder. As they have been prized for thousands of years for their beauty and ability to talk, they have also often been misunderstood. For example, author Wolfgang de Grahl says in his 1987 book The Grey Parrot that some importers had parrots drink only coffee while they were shipped by boat, believing that pure water was detrimental and that their actions would increase survival rates during shipping. Nowadays, it is commonly accepted that <b>the</b> <b>caffeine</b> in coffee is toxic to birds.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{what was}} reported, the Church revelation {{spelling}} out health practices (Doctrine and Covenants 89) {{does not mention}} <b>the</b> use of <b>caffeine.</b> <b>The</b> Church’s health guidelines prohibits alcoholic drinks, smoking or chewing of tobacco, and [...] "hot drinks"—taught by Church leaders to refer specifically to tea and coffee.|$|R
50|$|Xanthosine is a {{nucleoside}} {{derived from}} xanthine and ribose. It is the biosynthetic precursor to 7-methylxanthosine by {{the action of}} 7-methylxanthosine synthase. 7-Methylxanthosine in turn is the precursor to theobromine (active alkaloid in chocolate), which in turn is <b>the</b> precursor to <b>caffeine,</b> <b>the</b> alkaloid in coffee and tea.|$|R

2500|$|Supercritical {{carbon dioxide}} extraction: Supercritical {{carbon dioxide is}} an {{excellent}} nonpolar solvent for caffeine, and is safer than the organic solvents that are otherwise used. The extraction process is simple: [...] is forced through the green coffee beans at temperatures above 31.1°C and pressures above 73 atm. Under these conditions, [...] is in a [...] "supercritical" [...] state: It has gaslike properties that allow it to penetrate deep into the beans but also liquid-like properties that dissolve 97–99% of <b>the</b> <b>caffeine.</b> The caffeine-laden [...] is then sprayed with high pressure water to remove <b>the</b> <b>caffeine.</b> <b>The</b> <b>caffeine</b> can then be isolated by charcoal adsorption (as above) or by distillation, recrystallization, or reverse osmosis.|$|E
2500|$|When launched, Coca-Cola's two key {{ingredients}} were {{cocaine and}} caffeine.

5000|$|Decaffeination is <b>the</b> {{removal of}} <b>{{caffeine}}</b> from coffee beans, cocoa, tea leaves, and other caffeine-containing materials. While soft drinks {{which do not}} use caffeine as an ingredient are sometimes described as [...] "decaffeinated", they are better termed [...] "non-caffeinated" [...] because decaffeinated implies that there was caffeine present {{at one point in}} time. Decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1-2% of <b>the</b> original <b>caffeine</b> content, and sometimes as much as 20%. Decaffeinated products are commonly termed decaf.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>caffeine</b> {{content of}} {{a cup of coffee}} varies {{depending}} mainly on the brewing method, and also on the variety of seed.

The actual caffeine level in Red Bull can vary depending on country, as some countries have legal restrictions on how much caffeine is allowed in drinks. As is the case with other caffeinated beverages, Red Bull drinkers may experience adverse effects as a result of overuse. Excessive consumption may induce mild to moderate euphoria primarily caused by stimulant properties of caffeine and may also induce agitation, anxiety, irritability and insomnia.|$|E
