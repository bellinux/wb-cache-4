Arthor Munday, George Charlmers, Lesley Sinclair, Sue Vanderkelen, Ian Robertson, Helen Lempriere, John Smith, John Busst and Myra Skipper. Percy Leason and his family lived next door and <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> many friends who came to join in the work and the camaraderie of the camp. Two notable Australian artists said to be associated with Montsalvat were Leonard French and Albert Tucker.|$|E
25|$|Argentine youth {{began to}} musically and {{socially}} gravitate {{to either the}} suburban rock groups or towards the underground. And even within these two major groupings there were subdivisions (rolinga and post-chabón in suburban rock; sonico, punk, dark in the underground). <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> heavy metal followers, the large and expanding indie scene, and the tropical rock followers, genre increasingly intermixed with the fledgling Cumbia which would explode in the new millennium. The pieces were {{in place for the}} current period of rock in Argentina.|$|E

5000|$|Mikhail Fonotov {{wrote in}} his book Native Olden Times (Родная старина): A knife blade? Yes, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> bulat blade.

60|$|So {{it is in}} sex relation. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> a {{threefold}} result.

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> fools {{who took}} the {{organized}} bunco game seriously, honoring and respecting it. They were easy game for the others, who saw clearly and knew the bunco game for what it was.|$|E
60|$|The gardiens {{tried to}} stem {{the flow of the}} driver's eloquence; such details should first be given to the police. Voyons!

5000|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> several {{categories}} of {{scientists in the}} world; those of second or third rank do their best but never get very far. <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first rank, those who make important discoveries, fundamental to scientific progress. But <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> geniuses, like Galilei and Newton. Majorana was one of these. (Enrico Fermi about Majorana, Rome 1938) ...|$|R

60|$|It {{would not}} be easy to win her, he knew.

She must come to him happily, without one regret.|$|E
60|$|Renouard, speechless, {{produced}} a faint smile. The professor confessed in a jocular tone his impatience {{to complete the}} circuit of the globe {{and be done with}} it. It was impossible to remain quartered on the dear excellent Dunsters for an indefinite time. And <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> lectures he had arranged to deliver in Paris. A serious matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all. I myself nearly had {{the same}} idea. It was in my mind when I asked Mr. Wells that first {{question}} about the will. <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> bromide powders which she had made up, and her clever male impersonations, as Dorcas recounted them to us. There was really more evidence against her than anyone else." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> Bakers, and the Batesons, and the Jacksons, who {{all lived}} near and {{returned}} home at night; there was the Reverend Caleb Oriel, the High-Church rector, with his beautiful sister, Patience Oriel; there was Mr Yates Umbleby, the attorney and agent; and there was Dr Thorne, and the doctor's modest, quiet-looking little niece, Miss Mary.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> strange return boys, from Pennduffryn and the Bay of a Thousand Ships. He {{insisted on}} knowing them all.

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> men: busy at {{this moment}} with hurling wooden balls along the alley, at the further end of which a hollow-eyed scraggy youth, in shirt and rough linen trousers, was {{employed}} in propping up again the fallen nine-pins. Squire John Boatfield had ridden over from Eastry, Sir Timothy Harrison had come in his aunt's coach, and young Squire Pyncheon with his doting mother.|$|E

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> {{mosquitoes}} which {{lived here}} by the million and all seemed anxious for a bite; also snakes of a peculiarly deadly kind were numerous. A Zulu was bitten by one of them of so poisonous a nature that he died within three minutes, for the venom seemed {{to go straight to}} his heart. We threw his body into the swamp, where it vanished at once.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> {{painting}} and polishing-room, the joinery room, {{and the room}} where doors, window frames, and articles of furniture are constructed; also special garden benches, cleverly planned so that the seat can be protected from rain. These were designed by a young lady whom I chance to know in private life, and who, as I now discovered for the first time, {{is also a member}} of the Salvation Army.|$|E
60|$|Primarily, of course, the {{threefold}} {{object was}} concentrated on Armand.

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> young peasant {{girls who}} thronged about {{and stood in}} groups, {{blushing}} furiously under my glance, which Arcolano vainly bade me lower.

60|$|He {{wandered through}} the village, {{recognising}} with staid satisfaction the various gods he had known before the long journey. <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> dogs, puppies growing up like himself, and grown dogs that did not look so large and formidable as the memory pictures he retained of them.

60|$|No, he {{had seen}} no party of six {{horsemen}} riding {{from the direction of}} Djelfa. There were other oases scattered about--possibly they had been journeying to one of these. <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> marauders in the mountains above--they often rode north to Bou Saada in small parties, and even as far as Aumale and Bouira. It might indeed have been a few marauders returning to the band from a pleasure trip to one of these cities.|$|E
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> holiness and <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> superheroes of holiness, {{and many}} people {{recognized}} him as a superhero of holiness.|$|R
