Here, the bank splits and there are two separate tubes of two escalators and a stair each to each platform. The platform elevator has its own two turnstiles, and makes three stops (mezzanine, upper platform, lower platform).|$|E
5|$|Several {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the number of LIMs on the Robin tower. From opening day to 2004, Robin operated with 7 LIMs {{on each side of the}} track. Before the 2004 season, 3 LIMs were taken off on both sides of the Robin tower, leaving 4 LIMs per side. <b>Then</b> <b>two</b> more LIMs were taken off (one per side) the Robin side's tower, leaving three per side before the 2005 season began. A few weeks after the Chiller re-opened in 2007, two more LIMs were added back to the tower, bringing the total back to 4 per side.|$|E

Another is Arthur A. Levine, editor for Scholastic, the U.S. publisher of the Harry Potter books. Cunningham and Levine had lent their personal copies as part of Beedle the Bard exhibits in December 2008.|$|E

5|$|Vanderbilt {{defeated}} rival Sewanee 16–0. In {{the first}} period, Sewanee had to punt {{from its own}} end zone. The pass to Jenks Gillem went wide, and before he could recover it he was downed by Enoch Brown for a safety. Gillem had one punt of 58 yards that day. Vanderbilt's game seemed to stagnate until Wilson Collins was hurt and replaced by Tom Shea in the third quarter. <b>Then</b> <b>two</b> touchdowns came in the fourth period, one by Robins and another Turner. In his last game, Lew Hardage played well despite his hurt left ankle.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{from the}} outset, {{overcrowding}} {{has been a}} constant problem, and there have been numerous improvements to the facilities and below-ground arrangements to deal with this. After much discussion between the <b>then</b> <b>two</b> separate operators, a major reconstruction began in 1912. This entailed a new ticket hall, serving both lines, being built {{in the basement of the}} Bakerloo station, with the Bakerloo lifts removed and new deep-level escalators opened down to the Bakerloo line level. Access to the CLR was by way of existing deep-level subways. The new works came into use on 9 May 1914 with the CLR lifts still available for passengers. By 1923 even this rearrangement was unable to cope, so a second rebuilding began. This involved a second set of escalators being built directly down to the Central line and the CLR station building becoming exit-only. On 2 October 1928, a third escalator leading to the Bakerloo platforms was opened. Unusually, lifts came back into prominence at an Underground station when, in 1942, a set of high-speed lifts came into use, largely used as an exit route from the Central line platforms directly to the Argyll Street exit building.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on December 11, 1945, Stafford {{hosted the}} Tuesday and Thursday {{broadcasts}} of NBC musical variety radio program The Chesterfield Supper Club. On April 5, 1946, the entire cast, including Stafford and Perry Como, {{participated in the}} first commercial radio broadcast from an airplane. The initial plan was to use the stand-held microphones used in studios but when these proved to be problematic, the cast switched to hand-held microphones, which because of the plane's cabin pressure became difficult to hold. Three flights were made that day; a rehearsal in the afternoon, <b>then</b> <b>two</b> in the eveningone for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea had {{the best}} of the chances after this, with Shevchenko {{controlling}} a long pass with his chest before passing to Kalou, but his subsequent attempt went wide of the Liverpool goal. <b>Then</b> <b>two</b> minutes later Shaun Wright-Phillips, who had replaced Drogba, ran down the righthand side of the pitch. He passed the ball to Kalou, but he was unable to pass to Shevchenko in the Liverpool penalty area, after being blocked by the Liverpool defence. Minutes later, Liverpool took the lead when Bellamy advanced down the left hand side of the pitch with the ball, his pass found Crouch, who headed into the Chelsea goal to make it 2–1. The lead was almost extended minutes later, as a Gerrard pass found Aurélio in the Chelsea penalty area, but his shot was saved by Cudicini. Chelsea had a final chance in stoppage time from a Lampard free-kick, but the ball was cleared from the Liverpool penalty area by Sissoko.|$|E
5|$|Each of the {{proposed}} mechanisms for Sedna's extreme orbit would leave a distinct mark on the structure and dynamics of any wider population. If a trans-Neptunian planet was responsible, all such objects would share roughly the same perihelion (about 80AU). If Sedna were captured from another planetary system that rotated {{in the same direction}} as the Solar System, then all of its population would have orbits on relatively low inclinations and have semi-major axes ranging from 100–500AU. If it rotated in the opposite direction, <b>then</b> <b>two</b> populations would form, one with low and one with high inclinations. The perturbations from passing stars would produce a wide variety of perihelia and inclinations, each dependent on the number and angle of such encounters.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, Kouma {{remained}} in the Army. He served a second tour of duty as a recruiter, and <b>then</b> <b>two</b> tours as a tank commander, first at a unit in Fort Carson, Colorado, and then with a second unit in Germany. Though he {{remained in}} the Army for 31 years, Kouma did not see combat after his time in Korea. Kouma retired in 1971 at the age of 52, and lived a quiet life in McDaniels, Kentucky, after retirement. Kouma died on December 19, 1993, and was buried in the Fort Knox post cemetery. The Tank Platoon Gunnery Excellence competition at Fort Knox was subsequently named in Kouma's honor. There is a dining facility named in his honor at Fort Knox on Eisenhower Road.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, Hepburn {{starred in}} the dark-comedy Grace Quigley, {{the story of an}} elderly woman who enlists a hitman (Nick Nolte) to kill her. Hepburn found humor in the morbid theme, but reviews were {{negative}} and the box-office was poor. In 1985, she presented a television documentary about the life and career of Spencer Tracy. The majority of Hepburn's roles from this point were in television movies, which did not receive the critical praise of her earlier work in the medium but remained popular with audiences. With each release, Hepburn would declare it her final screen appearance, but she continued to take on new roles. She received an Emmy nomination for 1986's Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry, <b>then</b> <b>two</b> years later returned for the comedy Laura Lansing Slept Here, which allowed her to act with her grandniece, Schuyler Grant.|$|E
5|$|In April 1896, Chile ordered another armored cruiser, , and six torpedo boats. Naval {{historian}} Robert Scheina {{states that}} Argentina replied {{in the same}} month with , a near-sister ship to Garibaldi which was under construction in Italy. However, {{he notes that the}} small time lapse between the orders makes it difficult or impossible to know if this, the opposite, or either are true. As historian Jonathan Grant writes, the Argentines may have moved first to secure a definite, if momentarily tenuous, advantage over the Chilean Navy. In May 1898, the Chilean government found that the Argentines were planning on acquiring one, <b>then</b> <b>two,</b> Garibaldi-class cruisers. With tensions extremely high and war seemingly imminent, the two countries agreed to submit their boundary disputes to the British, which led to the Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case 1902 (Argentina, Chile). They also signed pacts which led to the resolution of the Puna de Atacama dispute. As the former arbitration took much time, the naval arms race, though it slacked during the time of eased tension which came with the agreements, continued.|$|E
5|$|In July 1642 Roger Smith subscribed £225 {{under the}} terms of the Adventurers' Act of 1641, whereby money loaned to the {{government}} of Charles I for the purpose of suppressing the Irish rebellion was secured by lands to be confiscated in that country. The lands had been confiscated in law but it would require the overthrow of the rebels in order to realise those property assets. The subsequent Doubling Ordinance of 1643 allowed those who had subscribed to receive twice the amount of land if they added a further 25 per cent of their initial financial aid: Roger Smith accepted those terms, contributing a further £75 in July 1643 and <b>then</b> <b>two</b> more payments of £75 in August and in October of that year.|$|E
