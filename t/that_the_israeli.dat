5|$|In November 2012, {{a report}} by the Palestinian Chamber of Commerce called for the Gaza Strip to be {{recognized}} as an economic disaster area after it concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> Operation Pillar of Defense caused approximately $300 million in economic damage.|$|E
5|$|Enderlin {{responded to}} Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in Le Figaro. He thanked them for rejecting that the scene had been staged. He had {{reported}} that the shots were fired by the Israelis because, he wrote, he trusted the cameraman, {{who had worked for}} France 2 since 1988. In the days following the shooting, other witnesses, including other journalists, offered some confirmation, he said. He added <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> army had not responded to France 2's offers to cooperate with their investigation.|$|E
5|$|Glubb {{nevertheless}} knew <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> {{army would}} {{sooner or later}} be stronger than his {{and that he had}} to prevent the strengthening of the Harel and Etzioni brigades to secure East Jerusalem. He redeployed his strength on 23 May to reinforce the blockade. The Iraqi army, at that time seconded by tanks, relieved the Legion units in northern Samaria and these were redeployed towards the Jerusalem sector. The 2nd Regiment of the Legion moved to Latrun. A full Jordanian brigade was placed in the area.|$|E
5000|$|In the Mitzpe Yishai {{neighborhood}} of <b>the</b> illegal <b>Israeli</b> settlement Kedumim, {{there are issues}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> have improperly taken control of private Palestinian land. <b>The</b> <b>Israeli</b> Civil Administration calls it [...] "theft", though it occurred in an [...] "orderly manner", but without any official authorization.|$|R
2500|$|Haig's {{report to}} Reagan on January 30, 1982, shows that Haig feared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> might start {{a war against}} Lebanon. Critics accused Haig of [...] "greenlighting" [...] <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> {{invasion}} of Lebanon in June 1982. Haig denied this and said he urged restraint.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, Lebanon disputed Israel's {{compliance}} with Resolution 425. Lebanon claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Shebaa Farms area was actually Lebanese, and demanded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> should therefore withdraw from there as well. Lebanon asserted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> UN certification of <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> withdrawal was [...] "invalid", because of Lebanon's {{claim to the}} Farms.|$|R
5|$|Sizable reinforcements—the 6th Battalion—came to Naguib {{only when}} his 9th Battalion {{was poised to}} attack Nitzanim. Aside from Nitzanim (June 7), the Egyptian Army shifted its entire {{concentration}} on clearing it flanks, successfully clearing a path between Majdal and al-Faluja. The Israeli chronicler and officer Avraham Ayalon wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> retreat from Hill 69 on June 3, {{along with the rest}} of the forces, which he believed unnecessary, was a major contributing factor to the subsequent Egyptian victories.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Maariv {{newspaper}} {{reported on the}} assassination of al-Wazir. The report claimed that Ehud Barak led a seaborne command center on a navy missile boat off the shore of Tunis that oversaw al-Wazir's assassination. Up until 1 November 2012, Israel however did not take official responsibility for his killing and government spokesman Moshe Fogel and aides to Barak {{declined to comment on}} the issue. According to the report, Barak, who was then a deputy military chief, coordinated the planning by the Mossad, as well as the army's intelligence branch, the air force, navy and the elite Sayeret Matkal commando unit. Mossad intelligence agents watched al-Wazir's home for months before the raid. The Washington Post reported on 21 April <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> cabinet approved al-Wazir's assassination on 13 April and that it was coordinated between the Mossad and the IDF.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, a {{coalition}} of human rights groups charged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> blockade of the city had caused the humanitarian situation in Gaza to have reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and that Israeli air strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well. In 2008, Israel commenced an assault against Gaza. Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military incursions and blockade of the Gaza Strip. In January 2009, at least 1,300 Palestinians {{were killed in the}} conflict.|$|E
50|$|Lawyers {{representing}} the Turkish victims and the Turkish NGO IHH wrote to Luis Moreno Ocampo, prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC) asking <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> involved be criminally prosecuted before the ICC.|$|R
2500|$|In 2000, Lebanon disputed Israel's {{compliance}} with Resolution 425.

50|$|In September 2007, Israel {{carried out}} an airstrike on Syria dubbed Operation Orchard. U.S. {{industry}} and military sources speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> {{may have used}} cyberwarfare to allow their planes to pass undetected by radar into Syria.|$|R
5|$|Salma feels {{isolated}} {{given that}} her son has moved to Washington, D.C. and her daughters are now married. The local village elder Abu Kamal (Makram Khoury) advises her to give in, but Salma decides {{to work with the}} young lawyer Ziad Daud (Ali Suliman). They take their case {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court. Mira Navon (Rona Lipaz-Michael), the minister's wife, sympathizes with Salma. The court case receives notable media attention, and Mira gives a news interview that her husband regrets. Mira believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> military overreacted, and she also shares Salma's sense of personal loneliness. Although they never speak, a complex human bond develops between the two women. As the Palestinian cause is dismissed, Mira decides to leave her husband and a concrete wall is built between Salma's land and the Defense Minister's house. A final camera shot reveals the lemon trees have been pruned.|$|E
5|$|Tuvia Raviv's armored brigade {{began its}} diversionary {{attack against the}} 16th Division's {{bridgehead}} at 5:00 PM on October 15, striking at the bridgehead's center from the east, after a fire preparation. It was repulsed by the Egyptians, as had been expected, but succeeded in its purpose. When the 16th Division's southern flank came under increasing Israeli attack, the Egyptians assumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> objective was to roll up the Second Army's right flank, not to open a corridor {{to the west bank}} for Israeli forces to cross the canal. For the next 24 hours, this remained the general impression among Egyptian commanders, and they reacted accordingly. Had they discovered the Israelis' true intentions earlier, the Egyptians would almost certainly have been able to defeat the Israeli operation, in light of the greater strength of their forces and reserves near the Deversoir area, on the east and west banks of the Suez Canal.|$|E

They have described this [...] "not an action of aggression towards <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> people" [...] but [...] "towards <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> {{government and its}} policies", arguing that [...] "the Palestinians Gaza {{and the west bank}} have no access to the same fundamental benefits <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> do." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1983, {{a letter}} from Barrow to Caspar W. Weinberger was {{released}} by the Pentagon. In the letter, Barrow criticized Israeli soldiers in Lebanon, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> were firing on U.S. troops, among other things. Israel denied the charges.|$|R
50|$|There is {{no doubt}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> were {{committing}} piracy {{on the high seas}} against the Freedom Flotilla and used deadly force against unarmed humanitarians whose only crime was defending themselves against a sea and airborne invasion by heavily armed aggressors.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> Arabs claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> had massacred Arab civilians, but <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> {{rejected}} <b>the</b> claims. A United Nations {{investigation found}} no evidence of a massacre. Following the operation, the Tel Aviv-Haifa road was open to Israeli military and civilian traffic, and Arab roadblocks along the route were removed. Traffic along the Haifa-Hadera coastal railway was also restored.|$|R
5000|$|A British {{guidance}} telegram to Middle East posts concluded: [...] "The Arabs' {{reluctance to}} disbelieve all {{versions of the}} big lie springs in part from a need to believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> could not have defeated them so thoroughly without outside assistance." ...|$|R
25|$|In 2005, Richard Landes {{produced}} an 18-minute online documentary video called Pallywood: According to Palestinian Sources.

5000|$|In 2004, Lee D. Ross, a {{professor}} of social psychology at Stanford University, developed a theory of a type of construal that he calls [...] "naïve realism." [...] In a simple experiment, Ross took peace proposals created by Israeli negotiators, labeled them as Palestinian proposals, and told <b>Israeli</b> citizens <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ideas in the proposal were <b>the</b> ideas <b>that</b> Palestinians wanted <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> to adopt. Then, he took the original proposals and told <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> subjects <b>that</b> ideas on <b>the</b> proposal were <b>the</b> ideas <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> wanted <b>the</b> Palestinians to adopt. <b>The</b> <b>Israeli</b> citizens liked <b>the</b> proposals from <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> to <b>the</b> Palestinians more than the proposal from the Palestinians to <b>the</b> <b>Israelis,</b> {{even though they were}} the same proposal.

25|$|The attack {{pioneered the}} use of the Israel's {{electronic}} warfare capabilities, as IAF electronic warfare (EW) systems took over Syria’s air defense systems, feeding them a false sky-picture for the entire period of time <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> fighter jets needed to cross Syria, bomb their target and return.|$|E
25|$|The {{exact nature}} of her death and the culpability of the {{bulldozer}} operator are disputed, with fellow ISM protestors saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> soldier operating the bulldozer deliberately ran over Corrie, and Israeli eyewitnesses {{saying that it was}} an accident since the bulldozer operator could not see her.|$|E
50|$|Hizbullah long {{remained}} silent on this {{episode of the}} war. On the sixth anniversary of the Lebanon war Hizbullah chairman Hassan Nasrallah claimed that Hizbullah had known <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> were collecting information on the rocket platforms and launchers and managed to move them without being detected. Most of the locations attacked by <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> air force were therefore empty.|$|R
50|$|In May and August 1973, the Egyptian Army {{conducted}} {{military exercises}} near the border, and Ashraf Marwan inaccurately warned that Egypt and Syria would launch a surprise attack on May 15. <b>The</b> <b>Israeli</b> Army mobilized {{in response to}} both exercises at considerable cost. These exercises were to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> would dismiss <b>the</b> actual war preparations right before the attack was launched as another exercise.|$|R
