40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of the effect of aberrations on <b>the</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> used in <b>the</b> high-angular {{resolution}} astronomical imaging techniques of speckle interferometry, Knox-Thompson and bispectral imaging. The analyses are based on a computer simulation of imaging through atmospheric turbulence. The results show that as the seeing becomes worse, its effect dominates the behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> which tend to be independent of (small) optical aberrations. However, if the wavefront variation due to fixed aberrations is significant over r o-sized regions in the pupil (where r o is the Fried parameter), <b>the</b> above <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> do depend on the aberration: in particular, <b>the</b> bispectral <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> is relatively sensitive to odd aber-rations, such as coma. ...|$|R
50|$|Since the (incoherent) point spread {{function}} is {{also related to}} <b>the</b> optical <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> via a Fourier transform, a direct relationship exists between the pupil <b>function</b> and <b>the</b> optical <b>transfer</b> <b>function.</b> In <b>the</b> case of an incoherent optical imaging system, <b>the</b> optical <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> is <b>the</b> auto correlation of the pupil function.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> of an mm'-type is {{the same}} as an m-type with m set to the product mm. [...] To choose values of m and m for best {{impedance}} match requires the designer to choose two frequencies at which the match is to be exact, at other frequencies there will be some deviation. [...] There is thus some leeway in the choice but Zobel suggests the values m=0.7230 and m=0.4134 which give a deviation of the impedance of less than 2% over the useful part of the band. [...] Since mm=0.3, this section will also have a much faster cut-off than an m-type of m=0.6 which is an alternative for impedance matching.|$|E
500|$|The goal of circuit {{analysis}} {{is to determine}} all the branch currents and voltages in the network. [...] These network variables are not all independent. [...] The branch voltages {{are related to the}} branch currents by <b>the</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> of the elements of which they are composed. [...] A complete solution of the network can therefore be either in terms of branch currents or branch voltages only. [...] Nor are all the branch currents independent from each other. [...] The minimum number of branch currents required for a complete solution is l. [...] This is a consequence of the fact that a tree has l links removed and there can be no currents in a tree. [...] Since the remaining branches of the tree have zero current they cannot be independent of the link currents. [...] The branch currents chosen as a set of independent variables must be a set associated with the links of a tree: one cannot choose any l branches arbitrarily.|$|E
500|$|The image {{analysis}} {{starts with a}} calculation of the input and output impedances (the image impedances) and <b>the</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> of a section in an infinite chain of identical sections. This can {{be shown to be}} equivalent to the performance of a section terminated in its image impedances.Laplante, p.341. The image method, therefore, relies on each filter section being terminated with the correct image impedance. This is easy enough to do with the internal sections of a multiple section filter, because it is only necessary to ensure that the sections facing the one in question have identical image impedances. However, the end sections are a problem. They will usually be terminated with fixed resistances that the filter cannot match perfectly except at one specific frequency. This mismatch leads to multiple reflections at the filter terminations and at the junctions between sections. [...] These reflections result in the filter response deviating quite sharply from the theoretical, especially near the cut-off frequency.|$|E
