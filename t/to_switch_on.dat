5|$|In Black Christmas, Kelli first appears {{with her}} boyfriend Kyle, telling him that she intends on {{spending}} Christmas with her sorority sisters. After having gotten back to Delta Alpha Kappa sorority house, while opening up presents, Kelli and her sisters are called by an unknown caller who, initially, uses Clair's phone and later Megan's. Worried about Megan, Kelli goes to her room only to find Kyle there. While attempting to find clues about her disappearance the power goes out, causing Megan's computer <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> from standby mode, revealing a recording Kyle made of himself having sex with Megan. After kicking him out of, she meets Clair's elder half-sister Leigh {{who came to the}} house looking for her.|$|E
5|$|The Ostsack (east sack) of the Krivasoo bridgehead, {{defended by}} the Soviet 6th and the 117th Rifle Corps, were {{confused}} by the Strachwitz Battle Group's diversionary attack on 6 April. The attack deceived the Soviet forces into thinking that the German attack intended to cut them out from the west flank. The actual assault came directly at the 59th Army and started with a heavy bombardment. The positions of the 59th Army were attacked by dive bombers and the forest there was set afire. At the same time, the 61st Infantry Division and the Strachwitz tank squadron pierced deep into the 59th Army's defences, splitting the two rifle corps apart and forcing them to retreat to their fortifications. Marshal of the Soviet Union Leonid Govorov was outraged by the news, sending in the freshly re-deployed 8th Army. Their attempt {{to cut off the}} Tiger I tanks was repelled by Lieutenant Günther Famula, who received a posthumous Knight's Cross for these actions, keeping their supply lines open. On 7 April, Govorov ordered his troops <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> to the defensive. The 59th Army, having lost another 5,700 troops from all causes, was withdrawn from the bridgehead. For these successes Strachwitz received the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds on 15 April 1944. News of the award had reached his headquarters on the early morning of 15 April via teleprinter message. The official presentation was made a few weeks later by Hitler.|$|E

25|$|A {{thyristor}} is a solid-state {{semiconductor device}} with four layers of alternating P and N-type materials. It acts exclusively as a bistable switch, conducting when the gate receives a current trigger, {{and continuing to}} conduct while the voltage across the device is not reversed (forward-biased). A three-lead thyristor is designed to control the larger current of its two leads by combining that current with the smaller current of its other lead, known as its control lead. In contrast, a two-lead thyristor is designed <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> if the potential difference between its leads is sufficiently large (breakdown voltage).|$|E
25|$|In October 1981, the Prince and Princess visited Wales. Diana {{attended}} the State Opening of Parliament {{for the first}} time on 4 November 1981.

The Princess made her inaugural overseas tour in September 1982, to attend the state funeral of Grace, Princess of Monaco. Also in 1982, Diana accompanied the Prince of Wales to the Netherlands and was created a Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. In 1983, she accompanied the Prince on a tour of Australia and New Zealand with Prince William, where they met with representatives of the Māori people. Their visit to Canada in June and July 1983 included a trip to Edmonton to open the 1983 Summer Universiade and a stop in Newfoundland to commemorate the 400th anniversary of that island's acquisition by the Crown.|$|E
500|$|The {{specifications}} of the Academy's {{building committee}} {{called for a}} large number of carrels (the library has 210) and for the carrels to be placed near windows so they could receive natural light.

[...] In the early hours of 7January 1980, Loh sat with Hoe, their arms locked together and their feet in separate tubs of water. [...] Lim applied a large voltage to Loh, who was electrocuted, while Hoe was stunned into unconsciousness. [...] When she woke, Lim requested her to lie to the police about Loh's death. [...] Hoe repeated the story Lim had given her, saying that her husband had been electrocuted in their bedroom when he tried <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> a faulty electric fan in the dark. [...] The coroner recorded an open verdict, and the police made no further investigations.|$|E

Miriam comes back, checks Annabel's pulse, and she and Alice (or [...] "Lewis", as Miriam now calls her) celebrate {{the success of their}} plan to reclaim the inheritance. The father voice was just a tape recorder, the tennis balls came from a machine, the well was filled in years ago, and the two show every sign that they are in fact a lesbian couple.

2500|$|The best-known {{shortcoming}} is {{the glare}} of sunlight {{in many of the}} labs. [...] Kahn fervently believed in the importance of natural light and strongly preferred to work by a window himself, [...] "refusing <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> an electric light even on the darkest of days." [...] Although he designed the labs to have an abundance of natural light, he was aware of the potential of having too much sunlight and worked to prevent it. [...] The screening material that he planned to use, however, was cut from the budget, and glare has been a persistent issue. The occupants have handled the problem in uncoordinated fashion by taping sheets of paper to the windows, hanging curtains and placing shelves and equipment in front of the windows. [...] A major preoccupation of Kahn's subsequent career was finding ways of avoiding glare by providing natural light indirectly.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{cars have}} at least one [...] "dome light" [...] (or [...] "courtesy light") located in or near the ceiling of the {{passenger}} compartment, to provide illumination by which to fasten seatbelts and enter or exit the car. These often have an option <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> when the front (or any) passenger doors are opened. Many vehicles have expanded this feature, causing the overhead interior light to remain on after all doors are closed, allowing passengers to fasten seat belts with added illumination. The extended lighting cycle usually ends when the vehicle's ignition has begun, or a gradual reduction in light emitted after a couple of minutes if the car isn't started, called [...] "theater" [...] lighting. Interior lighting has been added on some vehicles at the bottom edge of the dashboard, which illuminates the floor for front passengers, or underneath the front seats at the rear, to illuminate the floor for rear seat passengers. This type of convenience lighting approach is also sometimes used to illuminate interior or exterior door handles, exterior step running boards, or electric window switches.|$|E
2500|$|Plasmodium falciparum {{erythrocyte}} {{membrane protein}} 1 (PfEMP1) {{is a family}} of proteins present on the membrane surface of red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) that are infected by the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum. PfEMP1 is synthesized during the parasite's blood stage (erythrocytic schizogony) inside the RBC, during which the clinical symptoms of falciparum malaria are manifested. Acting as both an antigen and adhesion protein, it is thought to {{play a key role}} in the high level of virulence associated with P. falciparum. It was discovered in 1984 when it was reported that infected RBCs had unusually large-sized cell membrane proteins, and these proteins had antibody-binding (antigenic) properties. An elusive protein, its chemical structure and molecular properties were revealed only after a decade, in 1995. It is now established that there is not one but a large family of PfEMP1 proteins, genetically regulated (encoded) by a group of about 60 genes called var. Each P. falciparum is able <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> and off specific var genes to produce a [...] functionally different protein, rendering evasion from the host's immune system. RBCs carrying PfEMP1 on their surface stick to endothelial cells, which facilitates further binding with uninfected RBCs (through the processes of sequestration and rosetting), ultimately helping the parasite to both spread to other RBCs as well as bringing about the fatal symptoms of P. falciparum malaria.|$|E
