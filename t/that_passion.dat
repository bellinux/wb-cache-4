500|$|In about 1756–57 William Kent, a usurer from Norfolk, married Elizabeth Lynes, the {{daughter}} of a grocer from Lyneham. [...] They moved to Stoke Ferry where Kent kept an inn and later, the local post office. [...] They were apparently very much in love, but their marriage was short-lived as within a month of the move Elizabeth died during childbirth. [...] Her sister Frances—commonly known as Fanny—had during Elizabeth's pregnancy moved in with the couple and she stayed to care for the infant and its father. [...] The boy did not survive long and rather than leave, Fanny stayed on to take care of William and the house. [...] The two soon began a relationship, but canon law appeared to rule out marriage; when Kent travelled to London to seek advice he was told that as Elizabeth had borne him a living son, a union with Fanny was impossible. [...] In January 1759 therefore, he gave up the post office, left Fanny and moved to London, intending to [...] "purchase a place in some public office" [...] in the hope that [...] "business would erase <b>that</b> <b>passion</b> he had unfortunately indulged". [...] Fanny meanwhile stayed with one of her brothers at Lyneham.|$|E
500|$|Hayward {{categorized}} {{the writing}} team involved in Todd's redemption as [...] "an usually {{high number of}} male writers", and as an unusual situation because, historically, most soap opera writers have been women. In a June 1994 interview with TV Guide, in {{an article about the}} trend during the early 1990s of redeemed rapists on soap operas, head writer Malone commented that [...] "he bond between the woman and the violator is a great historical tradition in fiction and films," [...] and said that Rudolph Valentino, Humphrey Bogart, Kirk Douglas, and Clark Gable [...] "all began as totally irredeemable villains." [...] Although he did not think that most women want to be raped or are drawn to violence, he said that viewers [...] "are responding to the intensity of passion and an actor who lets you inside the torment. Some [...] believe they can be swept up in <b>that</b> <b>passion</b> and still turn it good. They think, 'With me, he'd be different. [...] The author of the article, Michael Logan, supported Malone's statements, and commented, [...] "Let's call a spade a spade. There is a large contingent of American female soap viewers who find something very attractive about rapists". [...] Hayward reported that many female viewers were furious that Logan had described them this way, and stated that their attraction to Todd was due to the skill of the actor portraying him.|$|E
500|$|... "Lost in Paradise" [...] is a symphonic rock, {{piano and}} power ballad, {{inspired}} by Lee's love for Evanescence and personal reflection on her past struggles. She revealed that after deciding {{to take a}} break, she {{spent a lot of}} time with her husband and having a simpler life away from her band, but still feeling like she was not [...] "whole". Instead, she felt lost and missed her work with the band and the writing process. Later, she decided to write the song as an apology to her fans for being gone for so long. Starting with piano and Lee's vocals, the song slowly builds, [...] "layering on stirring strings, booming timpani and, at the climax, some thunderous guitar chords" [...] as stated by James Montgomery of MTV News. He further stated that the song had similarities with the song [...] "Jóga" [...] (1997) by Icelandic recording artist Björk which Lee confirmed by saying, [...] "That's a big inspirational song for me. That's a song through my life that I've listened to a whole bunch. And to me, Björk, what makes her style are the strings, the orchestral elements, and <b>that</b> <b>passion</b> that it creates. ... It makes your heart pour out. That totally inspired me, and that song inspired me." [...] NMEs Tom Goodwyn found similarities between [...] "Lost in Paradise" [...] and [...] "My Immortal", a song from the band's first studio album Fallen (2003), [...] "before it was re-recorded with that massive guitar breakdown." ...|$|E

In addition to the rational faculties, Posidonius taught that the human soul had faculties that were spirited (anger, desires for power, possessions, etc.) and desiderative (desires for sex and food).

50|$|In general, it was Sneedorff’s view <b>that</b> <b>passions</b> like self-interest {{should not}} be subdued, but sublimated into forms that are useful to the state.

40|$|The Article {{is about}} “collective passions”, namely those emotive forms that {{dominate}} the action of whole groups, and therefore seem to escape the classic models <b>that</b> intend <b>passions</b> as “inner states”, so as necessarily individual phenomena.

2500|$|Hume's empiricist {{approach}} to philosophy places him with John Locke, Francis Bacon, and Thomas Hobbes as a British Empiricist. Beginning with his A Treatise of Human Nature (1739), Hume strove {{to create a}} total naturalistic science of man that examined the psychological basis of human nature. Against philosophical rationalists, Hume held <b>that</b> <b>passion</b> rather than reason governs human behaviour and argued against the existence of innate ideas, positing that all human knowledge is ultimately founded solely in experience; Hume thus held that genuine knowledge must either be directly traceable to objects perceived in experience, or result from abstract reasoning about relations between ideas which are derived from experience, calling the rest [...] "nothing but sophistry and illusion", a dichotomy later given the name Hume's fork.|$|E
2500|$|Allmusic {{staff writer}} Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album {{four and a}} half out of five stars. He said, [...] "This is further proof that Pearl Jam {{consciously}} turned away from the big, anthemic sound and spirit that won them a mass audience with Ten—they still had the songs and sound, they just chose to bury it. Lost Dogs crackles with <b>that</b> <b>passion</b> and it has another advantage: unlike most of Pearl Jam's albums, it's a fun, compulsive listen. More than any other album in its catalog, Lost Dogs captures what Pearl Jam stood for and what it felt like at their peak."

2500|$|Another example {{explored}} by Giddens is {{the emergence of}} romantic love, which Giddens (The Transformation of Intimacy) links with the rise of the 'narrative of the self' type of self-identity: [...] "Romantic love introduced the idea of a narrative into an individual's life." [...] Although history of sex clearly demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>passion</b> and sex are not modern phenomena, the discourse of romantic love is said to have developed from the late 18th century. Romanticism, the 18th and 19th century European macro-level cultural movement is responsible for the emergence of the novel — a relatively early form of mass media. The growing literacy and popularity of novels fed back into the mainstream lifestyle and the romance novel proliferated the stories of ideal romantic life narratives on a micro-level, giving the romantic love an important and recognized role in the marriage-type relationship.|$|E

40|$|W hat is the {{appropriate}} role of passions in democracy? Sharon Krause’s Civil Passions adds to the debate on this highly contested question in democratic theory. Faculty and other professionals whose work includes deliberative forums or related forms of engagement will find this book {{to be an important}} contribution addressing the critical question of how to reconcile impartiality with passions. While many would contend that deliberation within a liberal democracy must leave out passions so rational judgments can be made, Krause contends <b>that</b> <b>passions</b> can and should contribute positively to the process. She argues <b>that</b> <b>passions</b> and moral sen-timent are already involved in practical reasoning and should be acknowledged as such.
