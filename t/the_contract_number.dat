Approaching any of these poles brings some advantages and disadvantages, both to the service providers and to their customers. It is important to find a balance between innovation and standardization to maximize the results of all agents involved. ...|$|E

Still, the problem of automatic generation of punctuation marks has been largely neglected for a long time.

40|$|ComunicaciÃ³ presentada a Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language ProcessingWe {{introduce}} {{a novel approach}} to the decoding problem in transition-based parsing: heuristic backtracking. This algorithm uses a series of partial parses on the sentence to locate the best candidate parse, using confidence estimates/nof transition decisions as a heuristic to guide the starting points of the search. This allows us to achieve a parse accuracy comparable to beam search, despite using fewer transitions. When used to augment a Stack-LSTM transition-based parser, the parser shows an unlabeled attachment score of up to 93. 30 % for English and 87. 61 % for Chinese.
