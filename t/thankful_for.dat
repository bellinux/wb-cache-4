5|$|Once there, {{they are}} {{introduced}} to and begin {{to stay at the}} guesthouse of Kodandaram, an avid hunter, the neighbor and friend of Diganth's grandfather. Kodandaram, now handicapped from a hunting accident and confined to a wheelchair, lives with his wife Padma, daughter-in-law Sowmya, and daughters Radha and Pavani. Sowmya is widowed and teaches the village children; Radha, a student of Ayurveda, practices it alongside looking over the family's farming land; and Pavani is a student doing her pre-university course. Ganesh, a foodie, is fascinated with learning of Kodandaram's hunting spoils and persuades him to join them in hunting the very wild boar that left his legs crippled two years ago. At the forest, Kodandaram accidentally shoots Diganth in the chest, but is saved by a gong he had worn around his neck. They embark on another and final venture to kill the boar. As the boar approaches a rifle-wielding and wheelchair-bound Kodandaram, he gets up on his feet as an impulse and refuses to shoot it, <b>thankful</b> <b>for</b> bringing him back to his feet again, and calls it an incarnation of varaha.|$|E

25|$|Sometime after Lord Brahma {{commenced}} {{the process}} of creating the universe, he grew weak due to the sheer task before him. He sought the help of Lord Shiva and offered a yajna (fire ritual) to please the supreme divinity. Lord Shiva pleased with his offerings, appeared before him and sacrificed his shakti (energy) to assist Lord Brahma in the task of completing the creation of the universe. Lord Brahma <b>thankful</b> <b>for</b> the compassion Lord Shiva bestowed upon him, vowed that one day his shakti would be given back to him. Therefore, Dakshin (son of Brahma) performed several yajnas to obtain Shiva's shakti as his daughter in the form of Dakshayani. It was then decided that Dakshayani would be brought into the material world with the purpose of getting married to Shiva.|$|E
25|$|By 1796 Hoche had a {{free hand}} because, unlike earlier governments, the French Directory {{did not need to}} approve every operation. With unity of command and near-dictatorial powers, his expeditions {{continuously}} pressed the insurgents. An earlier truce worked in his favor by allowing the rebels to briefly enjoy peace; afterward they were less inclined to fight. Elsewhere, French victories over the First Coalition armies made Royalist prospects look dim. At length, rebel leaders Jean-Nicolas Stofflet and François de Charette were captured and executed. By March 1796 the south bank of the Loire River was pacified and Hoche deployed 15,000 infantry and two cavalry regiments against the Chouans on the north bank. By May the Chouannerie was quelled after most of the leaders were captured or gave up. In return for peace, Hoche promised that the priests had religious freedom while the young men would not be conscripted into the army. About 2,000 Republican deserters fighting for the rebels surrendered and their only punishment was to return to the Republican army. The hard-liners were not pleased with Hoche's lenient terms and wished that Willot had been in charge. However, the Directory was so <b>thankful</b> <b>for</b> Hoche's efforts that it publicly proclaimed him Pacificateur and bought him a pair of pistols, two good horses and riding tack.|$|E
25|$|While with Wordsworth, Coleridge {{was able}} to read the poem and provide his {{response}} to the ode's question within an early draft of his poem, Dejection: an Ode. Coleridge's answer was to claim that the glory was the soul and it is a subjective answer to the question. Wordsworth took a different path as he sought to answer the poem, which was to declare that childhood contained the remnants of a beatific state and that being able to experience the beauty that remained later was something to be <b>thankful</b> <b>for.</b> The difference between the two could be attributed to the differences in the poets' childhood experiences; Coleridge suffered from various pain in his youth whereas Wordsworth's was far more pleasant. It is possible that Coleridge's earlier poem, The Mad Monk (1800) influenced the opening of the ode and that discussions between Dorothy and Wordsworth about Coleridge's childhood and painful life were influences on the crafting of the opening stanza of the poem. However, the message in the ode, as with Tintern Abbey, describes the pain and suffering of life as able to dull the memory of early joy from nature but it is unable to completely destroy it. The suffering leads Wordsworth to recognise what is soothing in nature, and he credits the pain as leading to a philosophical understanding of the world.|$|E
