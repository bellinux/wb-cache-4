40|$|Objectives The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are <b>to</b> examine (1) <b>the</b> association between flexible employment and nurses' intention <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> <b>profession,</b> and (2) whether or not support at work mediates the association between flexible employment and nurses' intention <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> Flexible employment is analyzed objectively using non-permanent contract, part-time employment status, casual employment status, involuntary hours and on-call work, and subjectively using job insecurity. Support at work refers to organizational, supervisor and peer support. Methods Data come from our survey of 1396 nurses employed in three teaching hospitals in Southern Ontario. Descriptive statistics are provided. Bivariate correlations, hierarchical regression analysis and mediation tests are conducted. Results Compared to those in full-time employment, nurses in part-time employment do not intend <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> None of <b>the</b> other objective flexible employment factors are associated with intention <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> Perceived job insecurity is associated with intention <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> Low support at work contributes to intention <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> <b>profession</b> and mediates <b>the</b> association between job insecurity and intention <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> Conclusions <b>The</b> study provides evidence to health sector managers and policy makers that part-time employment, perceived job security and support at work are important factors to consider in efforts to retain nurses in <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> Nurses Flexible employment Job insecurity Intention <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> <b>profession...</b>|$|R

Where they exist, a person may only be called to the Bar by an Inn, of which they must first be a member. In fact, historically, call to and success at the Bar, to a large degree, depended upon social connections made early in life.|$|E
25|$|The Order of Free Gardeners is a {{fraternal society}} that {{was founded in}} Scotland {{in the middle of}} the 17th century and later spread to England and Ireland. Like {{numerous}} other friendly societies of the time, its principal aim was the sharing of secret knowledge linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>profession</b> and mutual aid. In the 19th century, its activities of mutual insurance became predominant. By the end of the 20th century, it had become almost entirely extinct.|$|E

25|$|In {{a larger}} context than merely {{a group of}} {{fourteen}} ships, {{the end of the}} River Defense Fleet, coupled with the demise of privateering, also marked the effective end of naval war conducted by amateurs. The increasing divergence between merchant ships and warships meant that the latter had to be commanded, and largely manned, by men who devoted their lives <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> Since the Civil War, no major maritime nation has considered resorting to private fleets, no matter what the circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, {{there were}} accusations that both G.W. Lee and the Shoe-wae-cae-mette crew were not amateurs. This led in 1879 to a new, tighter, {{definition}} of amateurism (see above) and {{a requirement that}} any entries from outside the United Kingdom must be made on or before 1 March and must be ‘accompanied by a declaration made before Notary Public with regard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>profession</b> of {{each member of the}} crew’, and this must be certified by the British Consul, the mayor, or the chief authority of the locality.|$|E

25|$|The formal {{recognition}} of psychiatry {{as a modern}} and legitimate profession occurred in 1808. In Europe, {{one of the major}} advocates for mental health nursing to help psychiatrists was Dr. William Ellis. He proposed giving the “keepers of the insane” better pay and training so more respectable, intelligent people would be attracted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> In his 1836 publication of Treatise on Insanity, he openly stated that an established nursing practice calmed depressed patients and gave hope to the hopeless. However, psychiatric nursing was not formalized in the United States until 1882 when Linda Richards opened Boston City College. This was the first school specifically designed to train nurses in psychiatric care.|$|E
25|$|While {{joining the}} force {{as a career}} is {{generally}} considered a respectable decision in contemporary Singapore, support from the ethnic Malay community has been traditionally stronger due to less social stigma attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> Traditionally, Chinese culture has eschewed careers in uniformed positions, resulting in a force dominated by non-Chinese officers {{for most of the}} force's early history. National servicemen also contribute a higher proportion of ethnic Malays in the force. The current ethnic profile of the force continues to have a significantly higher proportion of ethnic minorities compared to the national ethnic profile, although such an outcome is related to operational demands: police resources are typically deployed with a diverse ethnic mix to decrease communication problems while attending to incidents in ethnically-diverse Singapore.|$|E
25|$|One of Scorsese's {{trademarks}} was casting many {{actors and}} actresses new <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> De Niro, who was already committed to play Jake LaMotta, began to help Scorsese track down unfamiliar names to play his on-screen brother, Joey, and wife, Vikki. The role of Joey LaMotta {{was the first to}} be cast. De Niro was watching a low budget television film called The Death Collector when he saw the part of a young career criminal played by Joe Pesci (then an unknown and struggling actor) as an ideal candidate. Prior to receiving a call from De Niro and Scorsese for the proposal to star in the film, Pesci had not worked in film for four years and was running an Italian restaurant in New Jersey.|$|E

25|$|Energy and {{ambition}} drove Ward to seek {{employment in the}} town of St. Joseph, Michigan, where he went to work in a shoe store. This was a market town for a farm area devoted to fruit orchards. Starting in sales eventually led him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>profession</b> that made him famous. Being a fair salesman, within nine months he was engaged as a salesman in a general country store at $6/month plus board, a considerable salary at the time. He rose to become head clerk and general manager of the store, working there for three years. By the end of that time, his salary was $100/month plus his board. He left for a better job in a competing store, where he worked another two years. In this period, Ward learned retailing.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this did}} not affect RKO's plans for Astaire, first lending {{him for a few}} days to MGM in 1933 for his {{significant}} Hollywood debut, where he appeared as himself dancing with Joan Crawford in the successful musical film Dancing Lady. On his return to RKO, he got fifth billing after fourth billed Ginger Rogers in the 1933 Dolores del Río vehicle Flying Down to Rio. In a review, Variety magazine attributed its massive success to Astaire's presence:The main point of Flying Down to Rio is the screen promise of Fred Astaire... He's assuredly a bet after this one, for he's distinctly likable on the screen, the mike is kind to his voice and as a dancer he remains in a class by himself. The latter observation will be no news <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>profession,</b> which has long admitted that Astaire starts dancing where the others stop hoofing.|$|E

500|$|Hoffman's {{unexpected}} {{death was}} widely lamented by {{fans and the}} film industry, and was described by several commentators as a considerable loss <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> On February 5, 2014, the LAByrinth Theatre Company honored his memory by holding a candlelight vigil, and Broadway dimmed its lights for one minute. In another tribute, actress Cate Blanchett dedicated her BAFTA trophy to Hoffman when she received the award for Blue Jasmine on February 16. Three weeks after Hoffman's death, David Bar Katz established the American Playwriting Foundation in the actor's memory. With the money received from a libel lawsuit against the National Enquirer (which had inaccurately published that Hoffman and Katz were lovers), the foundation awards an annual prize of US$45,000 to the author of an unproduced play. Katz named this the [...] "Relentless Prize" [...] in honor of Hoffman's dedication <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> Regarding his material legacy, Hoffman left his entire fortune (around US$35 million) to Mimi O'Donnell in his October 2004 will, trusting her to distribute money to their children.|$|E
