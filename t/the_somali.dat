5|$|After the bloodless coup d'Ã©tat of 1969 {{that saw}} Mohamed Siad Barre's {{ascension}} to power, {{the government in}} 1971 nationalized the four foreign banks. The government combined Banco di Roma, Banco di Napoli, and National and Grindlays Bank to form <b>the</b> <b>Somali</b> Commercial Bank. The government also established <b>the</b> <b>Somali</b> Savings and Credit Bank {{to take over the}} commercial branches of Banca Nazionale Somala and Banque de Port Said, leaving the Banca Nazionale Somala with only central banking functions. <b>The</b> <b>Somali</b> Savings and Credit Bank had branches in Baidoa, Beledweyne, Berbera, Bosaso, Burco, Galkacyo, Qardho, Hargeisa and Kismayo, and for a while in Djibouti. <b>The</b> <b>Somali</b> Savings and Credit Bank had been established with the technical assistance and aid provided by the Associazione Bancaria Italiana {{in the context of an}} overall cooperation policy of the European savings banks.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in 1948, under {{pressure}} from their World War II allies and {{to the dismay of}} <b>the</b> <b>Somalis,</b> <b>the</b> British returned the Haud (an important Somali grazing area that was presumably protected by British treaties with <b>the</b> <b>Somalis</b> in 1884 and 1886) and the Ogaden to Ethiopia, based on a treaty they signed in 1897 in which <b>the</b> British ceded <b>Somali</b> territory to <b>the</b> Ethiopian Emperor Menelik in exchange for his help against possible advances by the French.|$|R

5|$|A new {{generation}} of more entertainment-oriented movies coming from <b>the</b> <b>Somali</b> film industry has grown increasingly popular among Somalis both within Somalia and in the diaspora. Referred to as Somaliwood, this upstart cinematic movement has energized the local movie scene, in the process introducing innovative storylines, production techniques and advertising strategies. The latter include cross-media marketing, with tie-in film soundtracks featuring prominent Somali music artists. Popular movies from Somaliwood include <b>the</b> <b>Somali</b> language slasher thriller Xaaskayga Araweelo, the action comedy Rajo, and Warmooge, the first Somali animated film. The young directors Abdisalam Aato of Olol Films and Abdi Malik Isak are {{at the forefront of}} this quiet revolution.

On 20 July 1961 and through a popular referendum, the people of Somalia ratified a new constitution, which was first drafted in 1960. In 1967, Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal became Prime Minister, a position to which he was appointed by Shermarke.|$|E

In an attempt to isolate the dominant Amhara rulers of Ethiopia, who supported Haile Selassie I, the Italians granted <b>the</b> Oromos, <b>the</b> <b>Somalis</b> and other Muslims autonomy and rights.

5|$|On July 1, 1960, the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somaliland) became {{independent}} and united, as planned, with the briefly extant State of Somaliland (the former British Somaliland) to form <b>the</b> <b>Somali</b> Republic (Somalia).

Following the creation of <b>the</b> <b>Somali</b> Film Agency (SFA) regulatory body in 1975, the local film scene began to expand rapidly.

5|$|The {{shift in}} support by the Soviet Union {{motivated}} the Barre regime to seek allies elsewhere.

Following the disastrous Ogaden War, Barre's government began arresting government and military officials under suspicion {{of participation in the}} abortive 1978 coup d'Ã©tat. Most of the people who had allegedly helped plot the putsch were summarily executed. However, several officials managed to escape abroad where they formed <b>the</b> <b>Somali</b> Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), the first of various dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre's regime by force.
