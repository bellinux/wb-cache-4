The Division Street Bridge is used as part of a detour in the event of closure of the I-95 Pawtucket River bridge.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} the Ring Loading Problem with integer demand splitting (RLP). The problem is given with a ring network, {{in which a}} required <b>traffic</b> <b>requirement</b> between each selected node pair must be routed on it. Each <b>traffic</b> <b>requirement</b> can be routed in both directions of the ring network while splitting each <b>traffic</b> <b>requirement</b> in two directions only by integer is allowed. The problem is to find an optimal routing of each <b>traffic</b> <b>requirement</b> which minimizes the maximum of traffic loads imposed on each link on the network. By characterizing extreme points of the LP relaxation of an IP formulation, we analyze {{the strength of the}} LP relaxation. Then we present a strengthened LP which provides enough information to determine the optimal objective value of RLP. Finally, we give an LP-based polynomial-time algorithm for the problem which can handle more general cases where nontrivial upper and lower bounds are imposed on the amount of traffic routed in one direction for some node pairs...|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{management}} of the radio spectrum {{can be accomplished by}} making use of channel assignment techniques, which work by allocating different channels of the spectrum to the cells of the network in a conflict-free manner (i. e., the co-channel interference is minimized). The problem of dynamically reallocating the channels in response to change in user location patterns, which occurs frequently for a micro-cell network architecture, is even more difficult to tackle in a timely manner. Most existing approaches use various sequential search based heuristics which cannot produce high quality allocation fast enough to cope with the frequent <b>traffic</b> <b>requirement</b> variations. In this paper, we propose a quasi-static approach which combines the merits of both static and dynamic schemes. The static component of our approach uses a parallel genetic algorithm to generate a suite of representative assignments based on a set of different estimated traffic scenarios. At on-line time, the dynamic component observes the actual <b>traffic</b> <b>requirement</b> and retrieve the representative assignment of the closest scenario from the off-line table. The retrieved assignment is then quickly refined by using a fast parallel local search algorithm. Our extensive simulation experiments have indicated that the proposed quasi-static system outperforms other dynamic channel assignment techniques significantly in terms of both blocking probabilities and computational overhead. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
2500|$|Interest in {{the idea}} revived around 1905. [...] The Premier, Joseph Ward, was the guest of honour at a luncheon hosted by the Featherston County Council on 18 December 1907.

40|$|Abstract—Sub-wavelength traffic {{grooming}} in optical networks {{has gained}} significant importance {{in recent years}} due to the prevailing fractional wavelength <b>traffic</b> <b>requirement</b> of end-users. Dynamic routing schemes improve the performance of WDM grooming networks compared to static routing as they can adapt {{to changes in the}} network state. In this paper, the significance of dynamic routing of fractional wavelength traffic based on request characteristics is illustrated. We propose a request-specific routing scheme, called Available Shortest Path Routing, and study its performance. The results are compared against other routing schemes that do not use request characteristics in selecting a path. It is shown that request-specific routing can improve network performance with respect to utilization and fairness metrics...|$|R
50|$|When {{processor}} P1 {{has obtained}} a lock and processor P2 is also {{waiting for the}} lock, P2 will keep incurring bus transactions in attempts to acquire the lock. When a processor has obtained a lock, all other processors which also wish to obtain the same lock keep trying to obtain the lock by initiating bus transactions repeatedly until they get hold of the lock. This increases the bus <b>traffic</b> <b>requirement</b> of test-and-set significantly. This slows down all other traffic from cache and coherence misses. It slows down the overall section, since the traffic is saturated by failed lock acquisition attempts. Test-and-test-and-set is an improvement over TSL since it does not initiate lock acquisition requests continuously.|$|R
