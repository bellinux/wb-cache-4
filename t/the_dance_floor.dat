Finn makes a Paper Crane for Bubblegum as a gift, but Jake says that Finn has a crush on her, which Finn denies. When they arrive at the party, however, no one notices them; everyone, {{including}} Bubblegum, is too preoccupied with a heart-shaped man named Ricardio.

She notes that in the quiet of the night, despite falsehoods and tears, she can feel satisfaction by touching herself. By stroking herself and perhaps her metaphorical wolf-pelt, Gaga is engaging {{in a moment of}} self-acceptance and self-soothing. Lady Gaga realizes that {{it will be difficult to}} maintain her dualistic nature, and alludes to upcoming death when she tells audiences that she is so content that she would welcome death. These words appear to foreshadow the end of , as the singer alludes to a calm acceptance of her spiritual/ghostly side.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{performing}} a simple dance routine {{surrounded by a}} wall of mirrors and then undressing until she is naked behind a white curtain, revealing only her silhouette. Beyoncé enters the club with a different outfit and hairstyle and some friends. Male patrons seated at the tables look on. She and Usher notice each other. They meet on <b>the</b> <b>dance</b> <b>floor</b> and dance intimately. Beyoncé performs an elaborate dance scene with female backing dancers. She swirls around in a champagne glass filled with bubbles. In the final scene, Beyoncé sits atop a piano and after being lifted down by a gentleman, she dances and poses as confetti falls everywhere.|$|E
5|$|Karofsky {{is elected}} prom king, and non-candidate Kurt is elected prom queen. Kurt {{runs from the}} gym in humiliation and is consoled by Blaine. Distressed at having lost, Quinn slaps Rachel, though she {{immediately}} regrets it, while Santana is comforted by Brittany, who tells her to be herself rather than hide her lesbian identity. Kurt is able to calm down and return for his coronation; his comment—"Eat your heart out, Kate Middleton"—garners applause that swells into an ovation. Karofsky, abruptly faced with having to publicly dance with another boy in the traditional dance between King and Queen, cannot do it; rejecting Kurt's suggestion that he come out then and there, he instead leaves Kurt alone on <b>the</b> <b>dance</b> <b>floor.</b> Blaine asks Kurt to dance with him, and they are soon joined {{by the rest of}} the student body.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} premiered on MTV Live on May 12, 1998. The clip {{starts with the}} rising of the sun, until it {{progresses}} into the Koyaanisqatsi inspired section, featuring time-lapse images of daily life, from people riding a subway, ordering food, bowling, and children in a classroom to sped-up city-scapes and freeways at night. Interspersed in the scenes is Madonna dancing and singing the track, her image partially merged with {{the backdrop of the}} fast-sped cityscape. During the intermediate verse the high-speed motion stops with the camera focusing on Madonna only against a sunset backdrop but quickly speeds up again. As the clip continues into nightfall, high-speed images of Madonna dancing in a discothèque is shown, with the camera focusing on the revelers, until she is seen falling asleep on <b>the</b> <b>dance</b> <b>floor,</b> and a revolving shot of planet Earth.|$|E

5|$|Just before junior prom, Jesse returns, having flunked out of UCLA, and Rachel invites him to {{the prom}} with her, Sam and Mercedes (Amber Riley). Jesse and Finn are {{kicked out of the}} prom when Finn picks a fight with Jesse over his attentions to Rachel on <b>the</b> <b>dance</b> <b>floor,</b> which {{effectively}} ends Finn and Quinn's campaign for prom king and queen. Finn ultimately breaks up with Quinn when he realizes he has a deeper connection with Rachel, {{despite the fact that she}} and Jesse seem to be a couple again. At Nationals, as the New Directions are about to go on stage, Finn begs Rachel to get back together with him, but though she professes her love, she refuses, still torn between her love for New York and Broadway and her love for him. At the end of their duet—"Pretending", written by Finn—an enthusiastic audience falls silent when Rachel and Finn share an overlong, unscripted kiss; the glee club comes in twelfth. Back in Ohio, Finn reminds Rachel that she has a year until graduation and any move to New York; he kisses her, and their relationship resumes.|$|E
5|$|Over the Stock Exchange floor, Pflueger {{mounted a}} ceiling {{composed}} of interconnected sheet metal strips above {{which he used}} indirect lighting to soften the edges and reduce shadows made by traders on the floor below. The result was so effective that Pflueger used it on a much larger scale above the audience seating at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, where it extended from and formed a continuity with the incised art on the proscenium. In Oakland, Pflueger flanked the stage with structures {{that appeared to be}} pillars supporting the proscenium but were instead layered, curved sheets of thin metal behind which lighting instruments cast light indirectly to give the columns a suffused glow. In 1931, he used the same concept to frame the stage at the Bal Tabarin (now Bimbo's 365 Club), and to bring a changing palette of color to the ceiling above <b>the</b> <b>dance</b> <b>floor.</b> Pflueger filed for and, in 1934, received two architectural lighting design patents, one for his ceiling grid with indirect lighting and one for the thin metal panels hiding lighting instruments. He used the patented ceiling grid once more in the Patent Leather Bar, in 1939.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Beyoncé {{preparing}} herself for her wedding ceremony. She {{is in her}} boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on <b>the</b> <b>dance</b> <b>floor.</b> The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a long shot {{of a group of}} dancers who have just {{finished}} rehearsing a dance routine. As the dancers walk out of view, Rihanna walks onto the middle of the floor, where the singer turns, and faces the camera, and closes her eyes. Standing still, Rihanna begins to click her fingers, whereby the screen begins to cut between a scene of Rihanna, who is noticeably in a different setting, and black fades. As the song's audio begins to play, it becomes apparent that the setting has changed from a rehearsal studio into a nightclub, which Rihanna in the centre. The scene is fairly dark with different colour lights projected into different areas of the nightclub, as dancers infiltrate <b>the</b> <b>dance</b> <b>floor</b> surrounding Rihanna. This scene is used for the first verse-chorus-verse part of the song, but changes to a scene of Rihanna, accompanied by several dancers, situated in a gym locker room for the second chorus. For the bridge, the scene changes back to Rihanna in the nightclub, but this time in a different change of attire. This scene is used for the final chorus. The video ends with a close-up of Rihanna in the nightclub standing still as the audio finishes, where she closes her eyes, which prompts the scene to change back to Rihanna {{in the middle of the}} rehearsal studio from the beginning of the video, to which she walks out of view of the camera.|$|E
