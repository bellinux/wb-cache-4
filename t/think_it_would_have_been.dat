500|$|Hopkins {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} on the subject of whether or not he believed the idea of Starling and Lecter heading off into the sunset as lovers (as happens in the book). [...] "Yes, I did. Other people found that preposterous. I suppose there's a moral issue there. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a very interesting thing though. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very interesting had she gone off, because I suspected that there was that romance, attachment there, that obsession with her. I guessed that a long time ago, at the last phone call to Clarice, at the end of SotL, she said, 'Dr. Lecter, Dr. Lecter...'." ...|$|E
500|$|I'm a good storyteller and I wrote a good outline {{and a good}} script.

Jaws 3-D was the only thing Joe Alves ever directed; the man is a very skilled production designer, but as a director, no. And the so-called 3D just made the film look murky [...] – it had no effect whatsoever. It was a waste of time.|$|E
500|$|After {{securing}} the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan considered his former rival Ford {{as a potential}} vice-presidential runningmate, but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the Republican National Convention were unsuccessful. Ford conditioned his acceptance on Reagan's agreement to an unprecedented [...] "co-presidency", giving Ford the power to control key executive branch appointments (such as Kissinger as Secretary of State and Alan Greenspan as Treasury Secretary). After rejecting these terms, Reagan offered the vice-presidential nomination instead to George H. W. Bush. Ford did appear in a campaign commercial for the Reagan-Bush ticket, in which he declared that {{the country would be}} [...] "better served by a Reagan presidency rather than a continuation of the weak and politically expedient policies of Jimmy Carter". On October 8, 1980, Ford said President Nixon's involvement in the general election potentially could negatively impact the Reagan campaign: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> much more helpful if Mr. Nixon had stayed in the background during this campaign. It would have been much more beneficial to Ronald Reagan." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. IGN columnist Brian Zoromski rated [...] "The Coup" [...] 7.8/10, indicating it as a [...] "good" [...] episode. He felt {{that after the}} [...] "brilliant" [...] episode from the previous week, [...] "The Coup" [...] was [...] "somewhat anticlimactic, as Jim doesn't interact at all with the Scranton branch and the Pam-Jim storyline is pretty much ignored." [...] Despite his disappointment with Jim's storyline, Zoromski commented that the [...] "best moments of the episode were the completely random ones, such as Dwight knowing that Jan wears blouses from Liz Claiborne and earrings from Ann Taylor." [...] AOLTV's Michael Sciannamea was also unhappy with Jim's scenes, writing that they were [...] "beginning to grate on [...] Is every branch office at Dunder Mifflin filled with crazies? How then does the company stay in business? I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> funnier if Jim ended up in an office where it's nothing but work and no play at all. The Call of Duty bits didn't do much for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{impending}} Writers Guild of America strike, writer and co-executive producer Maurice Hurley developed the teleplay {{in a day}} and a half from fan fiction written by Deborah McIntyre and Mona Clee. Due to the strike, certain story ideas were removed from the plot including the planned first appearance of the Borg which was subsequently delayed until the [...] episode [...] "Q Who". This was because [...] "The Neutral Zone" [...] was originally intended to be the first of a two-part episode, but due to the strike there wasn't enough time to write the second part and so the story was shortened. The second episode would have seen the Enterprise and the Romulans team up against the Borg. The script that was shot was a first draft, and due to the writer's strike in place, no amendments were subsequently made. Director James L. Conway later explained, [...] "If there hadn't been a strike, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a better script." [...] It was the second episode of The Next Generation directed by Conway, the first being [...] "" [...] earlier in the first season. He didn't direct another episode until [...] "" [...] during season six.|$|E
500|$|Mullen and The Edge both {{agreed that}} playing the Sarajevo concert {{had been the}} {{highlight}} of their careers; Mullen said, [...] "here's no doubt that that is an experience I will never forget {{for the rest of}} my life. And if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, [...] I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> worthwhile." [...] Bono described it as [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life", saying of the audience, [...] "I think they wanted, more than anything, a return to normalcy. That's what these people want, it's what they deserve." [...] He also speculated that the loss of his voice had [...] "allowed room for Sarajevo to take the gig away from us. They could see that things could go horribly wrong, they'd gone to a lot of trouble to come here, and they were just going to make it happen. And they did." [...] After the completion of the PopMart Tour, he said, [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv [...] anywhere music meant more than entertainment". Following the concert, President Izetbegović presented Bono with an honorary Bosnian passport, in recognition of his humanitarian efforts during the war.|$|E

500|$|The European leg of {{the tour}} {{featured}} two highlights. The group's 20 September 1997 show in Reggio Emilia was attended by over 150,000 people, setting a world record for the largest paying audience for a one-act show. U2 also performed in Sarajevo on 23 September, making them the first major group to stage a concert there following the Bosnian War. Mullen described the show as [...] "an experience I will never forget {{for the rest of}} my life, and if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, and have done that, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> worthwhile." [...] Bono called the show [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life". The tour concluded in March 1998 with gross revenues of US$171.7million and 3.9million tickets sold. The following month, U2 appeared on the 200th episode of the animated sitcom The Simpsons, in which Homer Simpson disrupts the band on stage during a PopMart concert. In November 1998, U2 released their first compilation album, The Best of 1980–1990, which featured a re-recording of a 1987 B-side, [...] "Sweetest Thing", as its single. The album attained the highest first-week sales in the US of any greatest hits record, while [...] "Sweetest Thing" [...] topped the singles charts in Ireland and Canada.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Smith re-joined Iron Maiden, {{along with}} vocalist Bruce Dickinson, who commented, [...] "When {{he left the}} band in 1990, I think {{everybody}} was a bit surprised at how much we missed him and certainly, I don't think anybody had realized how much the fans would miss him – big time. I wouldn't have rejoined Iron Maiden if he wasn't in the band. I just don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> complete without Adrian, and now, it's great having three guitarists." [...] The band embarked on a short tour, after which the new line-up's first album, Brave New World, was recorded with producer Kevin Shirley and released in 2000.|$|E

2500|$|During the [...] "Executive Actions" [...] {{symposium}} held by The Washington Post and George Washington University in April 2015 (shortly {{after the}} launch of the HBO Now streaming service), HBO CEO Richard Plepler said that he does not want the network to be akin to Netflix in which users [...] "binge watch" [...] its television shows and film content, saying [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a great thing for HBO or our brand if that had been gobbled up in the first week I think it was very exciting for the viewer to have that mystery held out {{for an extended period of}} time." [...] Pleper cited that he feels that binge watching does not correlate with the culture of HBO and HBO watchers.|$|E
2500|$|Baldwin {{supported}} the Munich Agreement {{and said to}} Chamberlain on 26 September 1938: [...] "If you can secure peace, you may be cursed {{by a lot of}} hotheads but my word you will be blessed in Europe and by future generations". Baldwin made a rare speech in the House of Lords on 4 October where he said he could not have gone to Munich but praised Chamberlain's courage and said the responsibility of a Prime Minister was not to commit the country to war until he was sure that it was ready to fight. If there was a 95% chance of war in the future, he would still choose peace. He also said he would put industry on a war footing tomorrow as the opposition to such a move had disappeared. Churchill said in a speech: [...] "He says he would mobilise tomorrow. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> much better if Earl Baldwin had said that {{two and a half years}} ago when everyone demanded a Ministry of Supply".|$|E
