25|$|In a {{preliminary}} final rematch against the Bulldogs, McLeod would kick a career-high seven goals while being opposed to Tony Liberatore who was {{reputed to be}} the most ferocious <b>tagger</b> in the game at the time. In the following game, against Grand Final favourites, the Kangaroos, the Crows would win by 35 points with McLeod emulating his feats a year earlier. Gathering 30 disposals and winning back-to-back Norm Smith Medals, McLeod became the first player to win two Norm Smith Medals since Gary Ayres in 1986 and 1988.|$|E
25|$|The Dockers and the St Kilda Football Club {{have seen}} a number of {{controversial}} events between them, most notably the AFL siren controversy at York Park in 2006. The match was set {{into a state of}} confusion with Fremantle leading by one point when the siren (which had not been very loud all game) was not heard by the umpires who then allowed St Kilda <b>tagger</b> Steven Baker to score a point after time had elapsed and, as a result, the match ended in a draw. The outcome of the game was taken to the AFL Commission and it was decided during the week that as the siren had gone Fremantle were judged to be the winners, disallowing Baker's point.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{commencement}} of the 1940 season, internal problems were brewing between the key personalities at the club. Some felt that the uneven performance of the team was due to Percy Bentley's coaching methods, {{and that he should}} be replaced. Jack Dyer walked out on the club and threatened to play in the VFA after his father, a committeeman who was involved with the anti-Bentley faction, lost his position at the board elections. Finally, the matter was resolved and Bentley kept his job, while Dyer returned to training {{on the eve of the}} season. The problems appeared to have been solved when Richmond won the semi-final against Melbourne to go straight into the 1940 VFL Grand Final. However, Melbourne reversed this result with a crushing win to pinch the premiership. Richmond had been out-thought by their old mentor Frank 'Checker' Hughes, who had assigned a <b>tagger</b> to negate Dyer. Dyer was furious that Bentley had done nothing to prevent his opponent taking him out of the game. The Richmond committee agreed with this assessment, so when Bentley (after retiring as a player) attempted to negotiate a higher fee to continue his coaching tenure, he was rebuffed. Incensed, Bentley quit Punt Road and moved to Carlton as coach, adding further spice to an already fierce rivalry between the two clubs.|$|E

This paper {{presents}} a classifier-combination experimental framework for partof-speech (POS) tagging in which four different POS <b>taggers</b> are combined in order to get a better result for sentence similarity using Hierarchical Document Signature (HDS).

As such, different weighted voting strategies are used in the experiments. Comparisons between individual <b>taggers</b> and combined <b>taggers</b> under different voting strategies are made.

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of POS <b>taggers</b> for syntactic parsing {{is a question}} little addressed in the literature. Because <b>taggers</b> reduce ambiguity from the parser's input, parsing is commonly supposed to become faster, and the result less ambiguous.

This paper empirically investigates these issues using two different rule-based morphological disambiguators as preprocessor of a wide-coverag e finite-state parser of English.
