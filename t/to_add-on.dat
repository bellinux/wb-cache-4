40|$|Abstract Background Hypertension {{and type}} 2 {{diabetes}} are common co-morbidities. Preliminary studies suggest that thiazolidinediones reduce blood pressure (BP). We therefore used ambulatory BP to quantify BP lowering at 6 – 12 months with rosiglitazone used in combination with metformin or sulfonylureas compared to metformin and sulfonylureas in people with {{type 2 diabetes}}. Methods Participants (n = 759) in the multicentre RECORD study were studied. Those taking metformin were randomized (open label) <b>to</b> <b>add-on</b> rosiglitazone or sulfonylureas, and those on sulfonylurea <b>to</b> <b>add-on</b> rosiglitazone or metformin. Results 24 -Hour ambulatory BP was measured at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. At 6 and 12 months, reductions in 24 -hour ambulatory systolic BP (sBP) were greater with rosiglitazone versus metformin (difference at 6 months 2. 7 [95 % CI 0. 5 – 4. 9] mmHg, p = 0. 015; 12 months 2. 5 [95 % CI 0. 2 – 4. 8] mmHg, p = 0. 031). Corresponding changes for ambulatory diastolic BP (dBP) were comparable (6 months 2. 7 [95 % CI 1. 4 – 4. 0] mmHg, p Conclusion When added to metformin or a sulfonylurea, 12 -month treatment with rosiglitazone reduces ambulatory BP {{to a greater extent}} than when metformin and a sulfonylurea are combined.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with treatment-resistant major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) {{remain a}} common clinical challenge. METHODS: This 6 -week, randomised, open-label, rater-blinded trial evaluated once-daily extended-release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR; 300 mg/day) as add-on to ongoing antidepressant and quetiapine XR monotherapy (300 mg/day) compared with add-on lithium (0. 6 - 1. 2 mmol/L) in patients with treatment-resistant MDD. Primary efficacy measure: change in Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from randomisation to week 6 with a pre-specified non-inferiority limit of 3 points on the MADRS. RESULTS: At week 6, both add-on quetiapine XR (n= 231) and quetiapine XR monotherapy (n= 228) were non-inferior <b>to</b> <b>add-on</b> lithium (n= 229); least squares means (LSM) differences (97. 5 % CI) in MADRS total score changes were - 2. 32 (- 4. 6, - 0. 05) and - 0. 97 (- 3. 24, 1. 31), respectively. LSM MADRS total score change was numerically greater at day 4 for both quetiapine XR groups (add-on and monotherapy; p< 0. 01) compared with add-on lithium. At week 6, the differences between groups for the secondary endpoints of MADRS response (≥ 50 % reduction in total score), MADRS remission (total score ≤ 10, add-on quetiapine XR only) and Clinical Global Impressions ('much'/'very much' improved) were numerically similar. Overall tolerability {{was consistent with the}} known profiles of both treatments. LIMITATIONS: Limitations included the open-label study design (although MADRS and laboratory measurements were performed by treatment-blinded raters) and relatively short study duration with no assessments in the continuation phase. CONCLUSIONS: Add-on quetiapine XR (300 mg/day) and quetiapine XR monotherapy (300 mg/day) are non-inferior <b>to</b> <b>add-on</b> lithium in the management of patients with treatment-resistant MDD...|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} changes in antibody levels towards citrullinated peptides derived from different candidate autoantigens and therapeutic outcome in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods Baseline and 3 -month serum samples from 316 patients with early RA enrolled in the Swedish Farmacotherapy (SWEFOT) trial were analysed for antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) and citrullinated peptides derived from vimentin (cVim), fibrinogen (cFib) and a-enolase (CEP- 1). At 3 -month follow-up, methotrexate monotherapy-inadequate responders were randomised <b>to</b> <b>add-on</b> therapy with sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine or infliximab. In these patients, anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) were also assessed at 12 and 24 months. The proportion of antibody-positive patients and relative changes in antibody levels were compared across ACPA specificities and related to therapeutic response and radiographic progression. Results During the 2 -year follow-up, the proportion of patients testing positive declined significantly regarding antibodies to cVim, cFib and CEP- 1, while anti-CCP antibody occurrence remained stable over time. Turning anti-cVim antibody negative was most common, and anti-cVim antibody seroreversion {{during the first three}} months associated with significantly less 2 -year radiographic progression compared with patients who remained positive. Median antibody levels of all tested ACPAs declined uniformly during initial methotrexate therapy and following response <b>to</b> <b>add-on</b> therapy, with no significant relation to treatment regimen or radiographic progression. Conclusions The influence of early antirheumatic therapy on ACPA seroreversions was markedly different across specificities, and early disappearance of anti-cVim antibodies associated with better radiological outcome. Thus, these data suggest that the disappearance of particular ACPA reactivities may be beneficial in early RA.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} add-on lamotrigine treatment on plasma glutamate (Glu) levels, in 29 epileptic patients. Plasma Glu levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography at baseline and at 1 and 3 months post-treatment. In patients with a seizure reduction of >= 66 % a decrease of Glu at month 1 was noted, followed by return to baseline levels at month 3. In the remaining patients a gradual increase of Glu was noted throughout the 3 months of the study. The above findings indicate that an excellent clinical response <b>to</b> <b>add-on</b> lamotrigine may be characterized by a statistically significant, yet transient decrease of plasma Glu levels, while increasing Glu levels may accompany a response that is moderate at best. The combination of lamotrigine with valproate was more frequent in patients with excellent clinical response and tended to result in glutamate decrease. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.
