5|$|The raid {{was entirely}} successful. The {{airborne}} troops suffered relatively few casualties, and {{the pieces of}} the radar they brought back, along with a captured German radar technician, allowed British scientists to understand enemy advances in radar and to create countermeasures <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} before the {{beginning}} of the race, there was controversy over the first stage. On arriving at the start, the teams discovered that the route used a variety of road surfaces, crossed sandy sections and included several ramps. As a result, the race organisers decided <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> the stage: the teams therefore competed only for the stage victory and for the team classification, not for the general classification.|$|E
5|$|Pssst is {{an action}} video game {{developed}} {{and published by}} Ultimate Play the Game that was released for the ZX Spectrum in June 1983. In the game, Robbie the Robot has to protect his plant (a Thyrgodian Megga Chrisanthodil) as it is attacked by various insects, each of which needs a different repellent <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> it. Pssst was the second game to be released by Ultimate, after Jetpac.|$|E

5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are part}} of the body's {{integumentary}} system and serve to protect the body against germs. Sebaceous glands secrete acids that form the acid mantle. This is a very fine, slightly acidic film {{on the surface of the}} skin that acts as a barrier to bacteria, viruses, and other potential contaminants that might penetrate the skin. The pH of the skin is between 4.5 and 6.2, and this acidity helps <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> the primarily alkaline nature of contaminants.|$|E
5|$|Alastair Campbell was the Labour Party's Press Secretary and led a {{strategy}} <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> {{the influence of}} the press (which had weakened former Labour leader Neil Kinnock) and create allies for the party. While in government, Campbell established a Strategic Communications Unit, a central body whose role was to co-ordinate the party's media relations and ensure that a unified image was presented to the press. Because of his background in tabloid journalism, Campbell understood how different parts of the media would cover stories. He was a valued news source for journalists because he was close to Blair– he was the first press secretary to regularly attend cabinet meetings.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February 1941, Müncheberg was {{informed}} by Gruppenkommandeur Schöpfel that the 7. Staffel had {{to relocate to}} Sicily in support of X. Fliegerkorps, {{under the command of}} General der Flieger (General of the Flyers) Hans Geisler, for actions against the strategically important island of Malta. With the opening of a new front in North Africa in mid-1940, British air and sea forces based on the island could attack Axis ships transporting vital supplies and reinforcements from Europe to North Africa. To counter this threat the Luftwaffe and the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) were tasked with bombing raids in an effort <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> the RAF defences and the ports.|$|E

40|$|The most {{commonly}} used dietary supplements are micronutrients. The antioxidant properties of several dietary micronutrients are of particu-lar interest to athletes due to {{the support of the}} body’s endogenous antioxidant defence systems that allows free radicals <b>to</b> be <b>neutralised</b> <b>to</b> help decrease oxidative damage. Dietary antioxi-dants include vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids (mainly β-carotene), polyphenols (eg, fl avonoids), selenium, glutathione and coenzyme Q 10 (see part 3 of this series for an excellent overview of anti-oxidants). Due to the enhanced interest of the role of fl avonoids in exercise, both in the media and scientifi c research, we have dedicated this issue to the topic: the very large number of fl avonoid...|$|R

5|$|On their arrival, Southern, Dempsey and Kenyon use a ray gun <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> the store's robot {{guards and}} bypass the {{security}} doors {{one after the}} other, ultimately arriving in the plutonium vault. Southern reveals his true identity and holds the others at gunpoint, commanding them to proceed to the Leader's proposed rendezvous point and capture him. The tables are turned, however, when a robot traps Southern in a crushing grip. Dempsey and Kenyon unlock the bracelets and make a getaway, jamming the security doors and leaving Southern {{to die in the}} nuclear explosion.|$|E
5|$|The loss of {{the weight}} of the gas taken from the {{cylinder}} makes the cylinder and diver more buoyant. This can be a problem if the diver is unable to remain neutrally buoyant {{towards the end of the}} dive because most of the gas has been breathed from the cylinder. The buoyancy change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated by carrying sufficient diving weights to provide neutral buoyancy with empty cylinders at the end of a dive, and using the buoyancy compensator <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> the excess weight until the gas has been used.|$|E
5|$|With the {{progression}} of the plans, the enhanced A Company was tasked with planning for {{an assault on the}} village of Magbeni, to the south of Rokel Creek, while the SAS would aim to release the captive Royal Irish soldiers by assaulting Gberi Bana, on the north bank. The Magbeni assault had several purposes: <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> weapons in the village which could disrupt the SAS operation, to distract the West Side Boys in Magbeni and prevent them from crossing Rokel Creek to interfere with the operation in Gberi Bana, to defeat the West Side Boys and destroy their military capabilities, and to recover the Royal Irish patrol's vehicles.|$|E

5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume {{that the world is}} free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.|$|E
5|$|Following the French {{surrender}} on 22 June, the French fleet {{was to be}} disarmed under German and Italian supervision, {{under the}} terms of the Armistice. The British high command, however, was concerned that the French ships would be seized by the Axis powers and placed in service. The Axis navies would then outnumber the British Royal Navy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill therefore ordered Vice Admiral James Somerville, the commander of Force H, <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir. He was instructed to order the French vessels to join the British with the Free French, surrender for internment, to scuttle themselves, or be sunk. On 3 July, Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum; the French rejected it, and so the British ships opened fire.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 the 8th Battalion {{joined the}} British Army in France {{as part of}} the 3rd Canadian Division. At the Second Battle of Ypres his troops faced the brunt of the German assault, {{involving}} the first use of poison gas in modern warfare. Lipsett is credited with issuing the first order to counteract the effects of poison gas, when he ordered his men to urinate on strips of cloth and tie them to their faces <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> the chlorine. Lipsett's battalion was instrumental in holding the line during the action and he was consequently rewarded by being made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, promoted to acting brigadier-general and given command of the Canadian 2nd Brigade, which he trained during the spring of 1916 to conduct major trench raids on German lines.|$|E

5|$|As {{the riders}} entered the flat lands near the Belgian coast, the winds became more problematic. Around {{three-quarters of the}} peloton had been dropped or had {{withdrawn}} from the race {{by the time the}} riders turned back inland. Gert Steegmans (Trek Factory Racing) was blown sideways into a ditch; the wind knocked several other riders over and caused Martin Velits (Etixx-Quick Step) and Lars Bak (Lotto-Soudal) to withdraw from the race. Mark Cavendish crashed and was forced to chase to attempt to rejoin the leading riders. The conditions were so severe that some team officials called for the race <b>to</b> be <b>neutralised</b> <b>to</b> ensure the riders' safety. Shortly afterwards, two large groups came back together. The main peloton was therefore made up of around 100 riders and was approximately two minutes behind the breakaway. The breakaway was caught soon afterwards.|$|R
5|$|In order <b>to</b> {{effectively}} <b>neutralise</b> the Würzburg {{system by}} developing countermeasures against it, Jones {{and his team}} needed to study one of the systems, {{or at least the}} more vital pieces of technology of which the system was composed. Fortunately for them, one such site had recently been sighted by an RAF reconnaissance Spitfire from the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit during a flight over part of the French English Channel coast near Le Havre.|$|R
5|$|Japan {{planned to}} rapidly seize European colonies in Asia {{to create a}} large {{defensive}} perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific; the Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war. To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter it was further planned <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> the United States Pacific Fleet and the American {{military presence in the}} Philippines from the outset. On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific. These included an attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, landings in Thailand and Malaya and the battle of Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|The 32nd Battalion was to {{commence}} its attack at Bellicourt at 09:00 on 29 September, and move south through the village. Due to mist and smoke from a preceding artillery barrage, visibility was poor. When the advance {{was held up}} by two German machine guns, Wark ordered a tank <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> them. On reaching {{the southern end of}} St Quentin Canal tunnel, Wark came across two hundred troops of the American 117th Infantry Regiment who appeared to be leaderless, and attached them to his own command. A short time later, with visibility still poor, he appropriated armoured reinforcements and began an advance on the village of Nauroy. As the fog began to lift, Wark organised his troops for an attack on the village from a southerly direction. By 11:30, the battalion had taken the village, along with forty Germans as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|The Maratha cannonade {{intensified}} as the British redeployed. Although British artillery {{was brought}} forward to counter, it was ineffective against the mass firepower of the Maratha guns and quickly disabled through {{the weight of}} shot directed against it. British casualties mounted as the Maratha guns {{turned their attention to}} the infantry and subjected them to a barrage of canister, grape and round shot. Wellesley decided that his only option <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> the artillery and get his men out of the killing field was to advance directly into the mouth of the Maratha artillery. He ordered his cannon to be abandoned and gave the command for his infantry to march forward with bayonets fixed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAntibodies neutralising porcine {{endogenous}} retroviruses (PERVs) were induced {{in different}} animal species by immunisation with the transmembrane envelope protein p 15 E. These antibodies recognised epitopes, designated E 1, in the fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR) of p 15 E, and E 2 in the membrane proximal external region (MPER). E 2 is localised {{in a position}} {{similar to that of}} an epitope in the transmembrane envelope protein gp 41 of the human immunodeficiency virus- 1 (HIV- 1), recognised by the monoclonal antibody 4 E 10 that is broadly <b>neutralising.</b> <b>To</b> detect <b>neutralising</b> antibodies specific for PERV, a novel assay was developed, which is based on quantification of provirus integration by real-time PCR. In addition, for the first time, highly effective neutralising antibodies were obtained by immunisation with the surface envelope protein of PERV. These data indicate that neutralising antibodies can be induced by immunisation with both envelope proteins...|$|R

5|$|The {{invasion}} of Martinique of 1809 {{was a successful}} British amphibious operation against the French West Indian island of Martinique that took place between 30 January and 24 February 1809 during the West Indies Campaign 1804–1810 of the Napoleonic Wars. Martinique, like nearby Guadeloupe, was {{a major threat to}} British trade in the Caribbean, providing a sheltered base from which privateers and French Navy warships could raid British shipping and disrupt the trade routes that maintained the British economy. The islands also provided a focus for larger scale French operations in the region and in the autumn of 1808, following the Spanish alliance with Britain, the Admiralty decided to order a British squadron <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> the threat, beginning with Martinique.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the amphibious {{landings}} depended on {{the establishment of a}} secure lodgement from which to expand the beachhead to allow the buildup of a well-supplied force capable of breaking out. The amphibious forces were especially vulnerable to strong enemy counter-attacks before the arrival of sufficient forces in the beachhead could be accomplished. To slow or eliminate the enemy's ability to organise and launch counter-attacks during this critical period, airborne operations were used to seize key objectives such as bridges, road crossings, and terrain features, particularly on the eastern and western flanks of the landing areas. The airborne landings some distance behind the beaches were also intended to ease the egress of the amphibious forces off the beaches, and in some cases <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> German coastal defence batteries and more quickly expand the area of the beachhead.|$|E

They also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup, and took a 1–0 lead over Manchester City into the second leg at Maine Road, where they were soundly beaten 4–0. However teams had begun to learn how to combat Charlton's attack strategy and left their centre-backs on the outside of the penalty box <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> the threat of Foggon. Despite the team's steady progress the club's board voted to sack Charlton in July 1976 after becoming increasingly concerned that he was overstepping his authority in negotiating business deals on behalf of the club and choosing the club's strip. However, the club chairman overruled the decision and Charlton remained in charge.|$|E
50|$|The epitopes of the viral {{envelope}} are more variable {{than those of}} many other viruses.

40|$|Dietary {{sources of}} polyphenols, which are {{derivatives}} and/or isomers of flavones, isoflavones, flavonols, catechins and phenolic acids, possess antioxidant properties and therefore might {{be important in}} preventing oxidative stress-induced platelet activation and attenuating adverse haemostatic function. Free radicals, including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, promote oxidative stress, leading to platelet hyperactivation {{and the risk of}} thrombosis. The consumption of antioxidant/polyphenol rich foods might therefore impart anti-thrombotic and cardiovascular protective effects viatheir inhibition of platelet hyperactivation or aggregation. Most commonly used anti-platelet drugs such as aspirin block the cyclooxygenase (COX) - 1 pathway of platelet activation, similar to the action of antioxidants with respect <b>to</b> <b>neutralising</b> hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), with a similar effect on thromboxane production via the COX- 1 pathway. Polyphenols also target various additional platelet activation pathways (e. g. by blocking platelet-ADP, collagen receptors); thus alleviating fibrinogen binding to platelet surface (GPIIb-IIIa) receptors, reducing further platelet recruitment for aggregation and inhibiting platelet degranulation. As a result of the ability of polyphenols to target additional pathways of platelet activation, they may have the potential to substitute or complement currently used anti-plateletdrugs in sedentary, obese, pre-diabetic or diabetic populations who can be resistant or sensitive to pharmacological anti-platelet therapy...|$|R
