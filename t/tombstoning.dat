25|$|Ramp {{is defined}} as the rate of change in {{temperature}} over time, expressed in degrees per second. The most commonly used process limit is 4°C/s, though many component and solder paste manufacturers specify the value as 2°C/s. Many components have a specification where the rise in temperature should not exceed a specified temperature per second, such as 2°C/s. Rapid evaporation of the flux contained in the solder paste can lead to defects, such as lead lift, <b>tombstoning,</b> and solder balls. Additionally, rapid heat can lead to steam generation within the component if the moisture content is high, resulting in the formation of microcracks.|$|E

40|$|The long-standing {{trend in}} the {{electronics}} industry has been the miniaturization of electronic components. It is projected that this trend will continue as Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and Electronic Manufacturing Service (EMS) providers strive to reduce "real estate " on printed circuit boards.

40|$|Using <b>tombstoning</b> (jumping from {{a height}} into water) as an example, this article claims that public health {{policies}} and health promotion tend {{to assess the}} moral status of activities following a version of health maximizing rule utilitarianism, {{but this does not}} represent common moral experience, not least because it fails {{to take into account the}} enjoyment that various health effecting habits brings and the contribution that this makes to a good life, variously defined. It is proposed that the moral status of health threatening activities should instead be defined by a version of act utilitarianism where both maximizing value and method of calculation are decided by individuals. In this account personal responsibility for health is reduced to the obligation to undertake calculations effectively, comprising of two duties; epistemic and reflective. If there is an individual epistemic duty, it is plausible to suggest that health promotion should present information in a way which facilitates it, but despite the prevalent language of autonomous choice, discussion of health promotion messages, for example, related to drinking and smoking demonstrates that this currently does not happen.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The factors determining the quality of surface mount technology (SMT) solder joints are numerous, and complex. The exploration of these factors, and how they may affect the reliability {{and quality of the}} joints can only be achieved through continuous research. In this project, essential areas of SMT joints were selected for study and analysis, with the intention of providing additional design and process guidelines for the production of quality SMT joints. In the infrared reflow process, one of the common defect phenomena is the occurrence of tombstoning; that is after soldering only one end of the component is soldered while the other is lifted up, assuming a position like a tombstone. The initiation of <b>tombstoning</b> during reflow was analysed based on the forces acting on the component. A model was developed to predict the initiation of this phenomenon. The model shows that, under vibration-free conditions, the surface tension of the molten solder {{is the source of the}} force causing the initiation of <b>tombstoning.</b> The contact angle, which varies with the length of the printed circuit board solder land, has a significant effect on the value of the surface tension acting as a force pulling upward on the component. The model further shows that <b>tombstoning</b> initiation is due to the combined effects of the surface tension; the weight of the component; the dimensions of the component; the length of the solder underneath the component; and the length of the solder protruding from the end of the component. Selected components were used as examples for predicting the conditions of initiation, and these conditions were further substantiated by a series of experiments. Another area of study was a method which directly pulled the components off printed circuit boards and this was used as a means for testing the bond quality of surface mount technology leadless chip solder joints. Components D 7243, CC 1206, RC 1206, RC 121 O, and CC 1 812 were selected for this study. It was found that the ultimate tensile force which breaks a component off the printed circuit board has the potential to be used as a parameter for measuring the quality of the solder joint. The effect of solder thickness on the strength of a joint has also been investigated. The shape of joints soldered by two methods, wave soldering and infrared reflow, were compared. Joints at the two ends of a component produced by infrared reflow were found more uniform than the ones produced by wave soldering. A recommendation is made here for the wave soldering approach in achieving uniform solder joints. The effects of solder shape on the joint strength were further investigated by finite element analysis. A convex joint was found marginally more robust than a concave joint. Two aspects of the internal structure of SMT solder joints were investigated, void content and copper/tin intermetallic compounds. The voiding conditions of wave-soldered and infrared reflow joints were compared. No voids were found in all specimens that were produced by wave soldering. However, there were always voids inside joints produced by infrared reflow. Microhardness tests indicated that the hardness of compounds at the copper/solder interface of infrared reflowed joints is lower than that in the wave-soldered joints. It is considered that the lower hardness of the interfacial region of the infrared reflowed joints is due to the presence of voids. Scanning electron microscopy was used to study the formation of copper/tin intermetallic compounds for joints produced by infrared reflow. The results show that Cu 6 Sn 5 was the only compound with a detectable thickness. Other compounds such as Cu 3 Sn, were virtually not found at all. Aging of the joints at 100 °C, shows that both the Cu 6 Sn 5 and the overall interfacial thickness grew with time. One of the important areas which had been overlooked previously and was studied in some details was the effects of solder paste exposure on the quality of solder paste. The characteristic changes of solder paste due to exposure were investigated in three areas, weight loss, tackiness, and rheology. The evaporation of low boiling point solvents was considered as the main contribution to the loss in the weight of the solder paste. The weight loss against exposure time was found to follow an exponential behaviour. A method was designed to evaluate the tackiness changes of solder paste due to exposure. It was found that the decay of tackiness against exposure time can be expressed by a power law. It is recommended that solder paste manufacturers should provide the necessary characteristic constants so as to enable the characteristics to be calculated after a specific exposure. The rheological changes of the solder paste as a result of exposure were also investigated. The implication on the printability of the solder paste due to these changes was studied and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{application}} of lead-free soldering has become oblig-atory in the electronic industry by the 1 st of July 2006, the in-depth analysis of the soldering process {{is more important than}} ever. The small chip components of the present days demand very accurate component placement machines to prevent com-mon reflow failures such as skewing or <b>tombstoning.</b> The ability of components to be self-aligned during soldering works against these failures, therefore it matters to what extent the solder pro-motes this effect. Dynamic behaviour of SMT (Surface Mount Technology) chip components during lead-free reflow soldering will be demonstrated in the paper. A force model has been intro-duced with the five main forces which determine the movement of the chip component during reflow soldering, namely: the force originating from the surface tension, the forces originating from hydrostatic and capillary pressure, the force of gravity, and the force of dynamic friction. The self-alignment of 0603 size chip components has been investigated by real experiments. SM chip components are misplaced intentionally by semi-automatic pick&place machine, and before and after reflow soldering the exact location of com-ponents was measured. The results have shown that the self-alignment of components does occur even in the case of 400 - 500 µm lateral misplacements. The explanation of the equations of the applied theory and the results of the experiments are pre-sented in the paper in details.
