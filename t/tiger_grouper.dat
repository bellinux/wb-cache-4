50|$|In its {{invasive}} range, few predators of the lionfish {{have been}} documented. Most larger Atlantic and Caribbean fish and sharks {{that should be}} able to eat the lionfish have not recognized them as prey, likely due to the novelty of the fish in the invaded areas. Lionfish have, however, been found in the stomachs of Nassau and <b>tiger</b> <b>groupers</b> in the Bahamas. The lionfish themselves are voracious feeders and have outcompeted and filled the niche of the overfished snapper and grouper. When hunting, they corner prey using their large fins, then use their quick reflexes to swallow the prey whole. They hunt primarily from late afternoon to dawn. High rates of prey consumption, a wide variety of prey, and increasing abundance of the fish lead to concerns the fish may have a very active role in the already declining trend of fish densities. As the fish become more abundant, they are becoming a threat to the fragile ecosystems they have invaded. Between outcompeting similar fish and having a varied diet, the lionfish is drastically changing and disrupting the food chains holding the marine ecosystems together. As these chains are disrupted, declining densities of other fish populations are found, as well as declines in the overall diversity of coral reef areas.|$|R

Food consumption (FC), food conversion rate (FCR), specific growth rate (SGR) and GET were significantly influenced by temperature and diet type. The highest mean SGR (1. 00 % BM day− 1, p 0. 05) were observed between any of the groups at 22 and 34 °C fed on either the shrimp or the pellet diet. The lowest statistically significant (p< 0. 05) FC was observed at 22 °C on both diets. The highest FCR (1. 208, p< 0. 05) was observed in the 22 °C+shrimp and 22 °C+pellet groups. The fastest GETs were observed at 30 °C, 12 h for fish on the shrimp diet and 13 h for fish on the pellet diet. A significant delay in gastric emptying (16 h) was observed at 22 °C in the group fed the commercial pellet diet (16 h). The best growth performances and digestion rates were observed at 30 °C followed by 26, 34 and 22 °C regardless of diet.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Tiger</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus) is much {{in demand}} by {{consumers}} {{because of their}} meat texture and stiffness. The quality of fish is strongly influenced by {{the condition of the}} water in which the fish lives. One of the parameters that determine the stiffness of fish flesh is the flow of water, so the research to determine the relationship between the velocities of water flow to the water quality, which in turn determines the quality of the fish, needs to be done. Some 60 fish (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus) were used in the experiments and kept in four 24 -L tanks with population of 10 fish per tank. The four tanks were treated with different water flow rates. Our study employed completely randomized design (CRD) experiments. The muscle histology as a function of velocity of water flow was analyzed descriptively. The correlations between the muscle stiffness and survival rates with water flow velocity were analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). If the results show significant effects, the Tukey test was then used. Our study revealed that skeletal muscle histology of fish exposed to flowing water showed no different with the group without water flow (control). The structure of muscle tissue of treated groups also showed no different with the control group.
