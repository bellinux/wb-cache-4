Because they have failed, Cavaldi is ordered to kill both the Grimms; but, after convincing Delatombe that the magic in <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>is</b> {{actually}} caused by German rebels, he sends them back. While Cavaldi stays behind with Angelika in the village, the brothers {{attempt to get}} into the tower. Jake succeeds and discovers the Queen and the power of her mirror. Meanwhile, another girl, named Sasha, is captured despite Angelika and Cavaldi's efforts to save her.|$|E

5|$|The Bosque Municipal (Municipal Forest) was {{donated by}} the Ross family in 1935. The main access to <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>is</b> in front of Ross Casino, near Paseo el Sol; or by a road near the Colegio Preciosa Sangre. The forest has a {{footpath}} surrounded by palms, pines, and many other varieties of trees.|$|E
50|$|There are 651 {{species and}} {{subspecies}} of vascular plants. Around 65% of <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> dominated by oak, and 30% - by beech. <b>The</b> <b>forests</b> <b>are</b> more that 200 years old.|$|R

50|$|The Reserve was re-established as <b>the</b> Minnesota National <b>Forest</b> on May 23, 1908. In 1928, <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>was</b> renamed {{in honor}} of the Chippewa Indians from whose land <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>was</b> created. Subsequent {{boundary}} expansions and land purchases increased the area of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> to its present size.

5|$|The forest {{contains}} {{four areas}} of pristine wilderness that have remained largely untouched by human {{activities such as}} mining, logging, and road and building construction. The four regions include the North Absaroka, Washakie, Fitzpatrick and Popo Agie Wildernesses. Additionally, {{a small portion of}} the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness extends into the extreme northwestern part of the forest, along the Montana border. In Shoshone National Forest, , constituting 56percent of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>is</b> designated wilderness. The wilderness designation provides a much higher level of land protection and prohibits any alterations by man to the resource.|$|E
5|$|A {{grove of}} {{enormous}} incense cedars exists near Diamond Lake, {{and there is}} a forest of ponderosa pine at the nearby Emile Big Tree Trail. The Umpqua National Forest features swordferns and Douglas firs. Rocky Mountain elks, pronghorns, and mule deer, bobcats, black bears, and mountain lions live in the Fremont–Winema National Forest. The forest's rivers support populations of trout, and the lakes contain fish such as the largemouth bass. <b>The</b> <b>forest</b> <b>is</b> inhabited by avian species such as mallards, American bald eagles, Canada geese, and whistling swans. Peregrine falcons and Warner suckers also infrequently enter its boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{set out for}} help, {{unaware that}} Maggie is tagging along, while Marge and Lisa stay behind. Separated from Homer and Bart, Maggie is soon adopted by a family of bears. Meanwhile, Homer and Bart plummet into a raging river where they lose their clothes, but hide their nakedness with leaves and mud. Marge and Lisa make {{themselves}} comfortable by a campfire, while the boys freeze in the wilderness. The next day, Homer tries to steal honey from a beehive, only to be attacked by the bees, but evades them by jumping into a mud pit. A nature photographer takes a picture of Homer covered in mud, mistaking him for Bigfoot, and soon <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>is</b> inundated with Bigfoot enthusiasts and reward seekers.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>forest</b> <b>was</b> from 1391 {{owned by}} the crown as part of Hørsholm Manor. Donse Krudtværk, a water-powered {{gunpowder}} mill, was built in 1704. A brickyard opened in 1879. In 1771, ownership of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>was</b> ceded to <b>the</b> state.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>forest</b> <b>was</b> perambulated in 1300 and {{the bounds}} <b>were</b> recorded. <b>The</b> <b>forest</b> <b>was</b> bounded by <b>the</b> River Severn on the west, by the River Worfe {{on the north}} and {{stretched}} east to Abbots Castle Hill and south into Kings Nordley.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>forest</b> <b>was</b> once {{inhabited}} by the Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi) people, who left ruins of adobe dwellings and other artifacts at an archaeological site now called Pot Creek Cultural Site. Some areas of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>were</b> formerly lands granted to settlers by the Spanish monarchy and the Mexican government. After the Mexican-American War, <b>the</b> national <b>forest</b> <b>was</b> established, {{and was named}} for American pioneer Kit Carson.|$|R
5|$|Logging, {{along with}} {{cultivation}} practices has devastated tree cover, causing severe environmental degradation in the country. Over 80percent of Sarawak's rainforest has been cleared. Floods in East Malaysia have been worsened {{by the loss}} of trees, and over 60percent of the Peninsular's forest have been cleared. With current rates of deforestation, the forests are predicted to be extinct by 2020. Deforestation is a major problem for animals, fungi and plants, as <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>is</b> cut to make room for plantations. Most remaining forest is found inside national parks. Habitat destruction has proved a threat for marine life. Illegal fishing is another major threat, with fishing methods such as dynamite fishing and poisoning depleting marine ecosystems. Leatherback turtle numbers have dropped 98percent since the 1950s. Hunting has also been an issue for some animals, with overconsumption and the use of animal parts for profit endangering many animals, from marine life to tigers. Marine life is also detrimentally affected by uncontrolled tourism.|$|E
5|$|Sawtooth National Forest is a National Forest {{that covers}} 2,110,408 acres (854,052 ha) in the U.S. states of Idaho (~96 percent) and Utah (~4 percent). Managed by the U.S. Forest Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it was {{originally}} named the Sawtooth Forest Reserve in a proclamation issued by President Theodore Roosevelt on May 29, 1905. On August 22, 1972 {{a portion of the}} forest was designated as the Sawtooth National Recreation Area (SNRA), which includes the Sawtooth, White Clouds, and Hemingway–Boulders wilderness areas. <b>The</b> <b>forest</b> <b>is</b> managed as four units: the SNRA and the Fairfield, Ketchum, and Minidoka Ranger Districts.|$|E
5|$|Shoshone National Forest has {{virtually}} all the original animal and plant species that were there when white explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger first visited the region. <b>The</b> <b>forest</b> <b>is</b> home to the Grizzly bear, cougar, moose, {{tens of thousands of}} elk as well as the largest herd of bighorn sheep in the U.S. The streams in the forest are considered to have some of the best game species fishing opportunities in the U.S. including Yellowstone cutthroat trout. More than 1,300 miles of hiking trails, 32 campgrounds and adjacent forests and parklands provide numerous recreational opportunities. There are four wilderness areas within the forest, protecting {{more than half of the}} managed land area from development. From sagebrush plains through dense spruce and fir forest to craggy mountain peaks, Shoshone National Forest has a rich biodiversity rarely matched in any protected area.|$|E
50|$|In the 16th century <b>the</b> Kurpiowska <b>Forest</b> <b>was</b> called Zagajnica, {{adding to}} its {{definition}} {{the counties of}} Łomża, Ostrołęka and Przasnysz, in which parts of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>were</b> located.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>forest</b> <b>was</b> {{declared}} a hunting reserve in 1541 to protect bison.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>forest</b> <b>was</b> {{owned by}} <b>the</b> crown but almost {{disappeared}} in the 18th century due to deforestation. <b>The</b> current <b>forest</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> result of a reforestation programme which began in about 1800.|$|R
5|$|Stallions must be {{registered}} New Foresters, {{and are not}} allowed to run free all year round on the Forest. They normally are turned out only for a limited period in the spring and summer, when they gather several groups of mares and youngstock into larger herds and defend them against other stallions. A small number (usually fewer than 50) are turned out, generally between May and August. This ensures that foals are born neither too early (before the spring grass is coming through), nor too late (as the colder weather is setting in and the grazing and browsing on <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>is</b> dying back) in the following year.|$|E
5|$|Warriors is {{a series}} of novels {{published}} by HarperCollins; it is written by authors Kate Cary, Cherith Baldry, Tui Sutherland, with the plot developed by editor Victoria Holmes, who collectively use the pseudonym Erin Hunter. The series follows the adventures of four Clans of wild cats—ThunderClan, ShadowClan, WindClan, and RiverClan —in their forest and lake homes, who look up to StarClan, their warriors ancestors, and spirits in the stars, who guide the four clans.

His lieutenants lead the Goblin army and launch {{an assault on the}} Elven forest of Lórien. Despite heavy resistance, <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>is</b> overrun, with Celeborn slain and Galadriel having fled to Rivendell; even Caras Galadhon collapses under the sheer force of the massive invasion. The Mouth peers eagerly into the captured Mirror of Galadriel for his next attack, as his Goblins celebrate their triumph over the Elves amidst the ruins of the once-mighty ancient stronghold. Another group of Goblins, led by the Goblin King Gorkil, attacks the Grey Havens by land and sea. The Elven port is destroyed and captured, and the march across Eriador begins; Hobbits of the Shire are chosen as the next target. Gorkil's horde manages to crush the Hobbits and burn their country to the ground, but Saruman's servant Gríma Wormtongue, suddenly appears with a large army of Isengard Uruks and claims the land for his master. The Goblins annihilate the well-trained army and kill Wormtongue, taking the Shire for themselves.|$|E
