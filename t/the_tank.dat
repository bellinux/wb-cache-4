5|$|Loading an {{oil tanker}} {{consists}} primarily of pumping cargo into the ship's tanks. As oil enters <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> the vapors inside <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> must be somehow expelled.

However, the 1/6th Battalion, The Essex Regiment attacked and captured Beach and Sea Posts before attacking the Rafa Redoubt and trench systems, suffering light casualties. In support, a tank rolled out wire as it drove {{along the front}} line from Sea Post to Beach Post. Cricket Redoubt was captured {{with the help of}} <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> from Beach Post; although <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> was temporarily disabled in the process. After being repaired, <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> was transporting some engineers' stores to Sheikh Hasan when it was hit and disabled again.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tank,</b> Light, Mk VIII (A25), {{also known}} as the Harry Hopkins, after American President Roosevelt's chief {{diplomatic}} advisor, was a British light tank produced by Vickers-Armstrong during the Second World War. The Mk VIII was the last in the line of light tanks the company had built for the British Army, and was intended to be the successor of the previous light tank designed by Vickers-Armstrong, the Mk VII Tetrarch. A number of changes were made to the Mk VIII, most notably increasing its width, length and weight and also increasing the thickness of the armour. The design of <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> was submitted to the War Office in late 1941, with an initial order for 1,000 models being made by <b>the</b> <b>Tank</b> Board of the War Office in the same month, a number that increased to 2,410 in November. Production began in June 1942 but immediately began encountering problems with <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> and a number of modifications had to be made to the design after complaints were made by the War Office and the Fighting Vehicle Proving Establishment. These problems were so acute that only 6 tanks had been produced by mid-1943, and only 100 when production ended in February 1945.|$|E
5|$|The War Office also {{considered}} the Tetrarch's cooling system faulty, making <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> unsuitable for service in hotter climates, {{such as the}} Middle East and North Africa.|$|E

5|$|A {{decision}} {{had recently been}} made by the War Office that light tanks were no longer to be generally used in the British Army; on the whole they had performed poorly during the Battle of France and were considered to be a liability. As a result, the Vickers-Armstrong Light Tank Mk VII Tetrarch light tank was now considered obsolete. This made it available for use by the airborne forces and it was chosen by the War Office as <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> to be transported by glider. However, it had not been designed specifically as an airborne tank or to be airmobile, and it also possessed several faults. Its size limited the possible crew to three—a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret—which was found to be too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, in addition to his own duties, had to act as loader for the 2-pounder, which caused delays in combat; a report on <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> written in January 1941 stated that since the commander had both to fight and control <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible. The War Office was also aware that <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> had a faulty cooling system that made the Tetrarch unsuitable for service in hotter climates, such as the Middle East and North Africa.|$|E

5|$|A second variant on the Tetrarch {{design was}} the Tetrarch Duplex Drive ("Tetrarch DD"). The Duplex Drive system {{was invented by}} Nicholas Straussler, and was {{designed}} to allow a tank to 'swim' through water and participate in amphibious operations. The system functioned by erecting a large waterproof canvas screen around <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> above its tracks, which was supported by thirty-six inflatable tubes and steel struts; this gave <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> sufficient buoyancy to float, and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank's engine. The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> reached land. The system was fitted during June 1941, as the Tetrarch was the lightest light tank available at the time; the converted tank was successfully tested {{on a number of}} lakes and reservoirs, allowing the Duplex Drive system to be tested on heavier tanks, such as the Valentine. The system would be used during Operation Overlord, when M4 Sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches.|$|E

5|$|Because the liquid-to-gas {{expansion}} ratio of nitrogen is 1:694 at 20°C, {{a tremendous amount}} of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporised in an enclosed space. In an incident on January 12, 2006 at Texas A University, the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed. As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup, <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> failed catastrophically.

40|$|A vortex motion phase {{separator}} is disclosed for transferring {{a liquid}} in a zero gravity environment {{while at the}} same time separating the liquid from vapors found within either the sender or <b>the</b> receiving <b>tanks.</b> <b>The</b> separator comprises a rigid sender tank having a circular cross-section and rigid receiver tank having a circular cross-section. A plurality of ducts connects <b>the</b> sender <b>tank</b> and <b>the</b> receiver <b>tank.</b> Disposed within <b>the</b> ducts connecting <b>the</b> receiver <b>tank</b> and <b>the</b> sender <b>tank</b> is a pump and a plurality of valves. The pump is powered by an electric motor and is adapted to draw either the liquid or a mixture of the liquid and the vapor from <b>the</b> sender <b>tank.</b> Initially, <b>the</b> mixture drawn from <b>the</b> sender <b>tank</b> is directed through a portion of the ductwork and back into <b>the</b> sender <b>tank</b> at a tangent to the inside surface of <b>the</b> sender <b>tank,</b> thereby creating a swirling vortex of the mixture within <b>the</b> sender <b>tank.</b> As <b>the</b> pumping action increases, the speed of the swirling action within <b>the</b> sender <b>tank</b> increases creating an increase in the centrifugal force operating on the mixture. The effect of the centrifugal force is to cause the heavier liquid to migrate to the inside surface of <b>the</b> sender <b>tank</b> and to separate from the vapor. When this separation reaches a predetermined degree, control means is activated to direct the liquid conveyed by the pump directly into <b>the</b> receiver <b>tank.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, the vapor within <b>the</b> receiver <b>tank</b> is directed from <b>the</b> receiver <b>tank</b> back into <b>the</b> sender <b>tank.</b> This flow continues until substantially all of the liquid is transferred from <b>the</b> sender <b>tank</b> to <b>the</b> receiver <b>tank...</b>|$|R
