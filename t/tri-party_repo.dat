NSD's {{collateral management}} {{system is the}} first of its kind in the Russian market, which was launched to service Bank of Russia's repo transactions with a basket of securities.|$|E
5000|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of a <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> {{is that a}} custodian bank or international clearing organization, the tri-party agent, acts as an intermediary {{between the two parties}} to the repo. The tri-party agent is responsible for the administration of the transaction including collateral allocation, marking to market, and substitution of collateral. In the US, the two principal tri-party agents are The Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan Chase, whilst in Europe the principal tri-party agents are Euroclear and Clearstream with SIX offering services in the Swiss market. The size of the US <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> market peaked in 2008 before the worst effects of the crisis at approximately $2.8 trillion and by mid-2010 was about $1.6 trillion.As tri-party agents administer the equivalent of hundreds of billions of USD of global collateral, they have the scale to subscribe to multiple data feeds to maximise the universe of coverage. As part of a tri-party agreement the three parties to the agreement, the tri-party agent, the repo buyer (the Collateral Taker/Cash Provider, [...] "CAP") and the repo seller (Cash Borrower/Collateral Provider, [...] "COP") agree to a collateral management service agreement which includes an [...] "eligible collateral profile". It is this [...] "eligible collateral profile" [...] that enables the repo buyer to define their risk appetite in respect of the collateral that they are prepared to hold against their cash. For example, a more risk averse repo buyer may wish to only hold [...] "on-the-run" [...] government bonds as collateral. In the event of a liquidation event of the repo seller the collateral is highly liquid thus enabling the repo buyer to sell the collateral quickly. A less risk averse repo buyer may be prepared to take non investment grade bonds or equities as collateral, which may be less liquid and may suffer a higher price volatility {{in the event of a}} repo seller default, making it more difficult for the repo buyer to sell the collateral and recover their cash. The tri-party agents are able to offer sophisticated collateral eligibility filters which allow the repo buyer to create these [...] "eligible collateral profiles" [...] which can systemically generate collateral pools which reflect the buyers risk appetite. Collateral eligibility criteria could include asset type, issuer, currency, domicile, credit rating, maturity, index, issue size, average daily traded volume, etc. Both the lender (repo buyer) and borrower (repo seller) of cash enter into these transactions to avoid the administrative burden of bi-lateral repos. In addition, because the collateral is being held by an agent, counterparty risk is reduced. A <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> may be seen as the outgrowth of the due bill repo. A due bill repo is a repo in which the collateral is retained by the Cash borrower and not delivered to the cash provider. There is an increased element of risk when compared to the <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> as collateral on a due bill repo is held within a client custody account at the Cash Borrower rather than a collateral account at a neutral third party.|$|E
5000|$|Repo {{transactions}} {{occur in}} three forms: specified delivery, tri-party, {{and held in}} custody (wherein the [...] "selling" [...] party holds the security during the term of the repo). The third form (hold-in-custody) is quite rare, particularly in developing markets, primarily due to {{the risk that the}} seller will become insolvent prior to maturation of the repo and the buyer will be unable to recover the securities that were posted as collateral to secure the transaction. The first form—specified delivery—requires the delivery of a prespecified bond at the onset, and at maturity of the contractual period. Tri-party essentially is a basket form of transaction, and allows for a wider range of instruments in the basket or pool. In a <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> transaction a third party clearing agent or bank is interposed between the [...] "seller" [...] and the [...] "buyer". The third party maintains control of the securities that are the subject of the agreement and processes the payments from the [...] "seller" [...] to the [...] "buyer." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a quantitative {{account of the}} <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> market during the recent financial crisis. Using data from July 2008 to January 2010, we show {{that the level of}} haircuts and the amount of funding were surprisingly stable in this market. The stability of the haircuts contrasts with evidence from the bilateral repo market, where, as shown by Gorton and Metrick (2011), haircuts increased sharply. During the crisis, adjustments in the volume of funding to dealers were not gradual; instead, the amount of funding in the <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> market can decrease precipitously.

We provide an extensive description of the mechanics of this market. We also use data from July 2008 to early 2010 to document quantitative features of he market. We find that both the level of haircuts {{and the amount of}} funding were surprisingly stable in this market. The stability of the margins is in contrast to evidence from other repo markets. Perhaps surprisingly, the data reveal relatively few signs of stress in the market for dealers other than Lehman Brothers, on which we provide some evidence.

Th e borrowers pledge their securities as col-lateral for the cash they want to borrow.

40|$|R epo {{contracts}} are {{a kind of}} collateralized loan that has become pre-dominant in the United States among large cash investors. Thereare several types of repo contracts, such as bilateral delivery-versus-payment repos, interdealer repos, and tri-party repos. A significant portion of repo transactions in the United States take the form of tri-party repos, where a third party (a clearing bank) provides collateral management and settlement services to the borrower and the lender. The tri-party segment of the U. S. repo market {{is the subject of this}} article. The <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> market played a significant role during the 2007 – 2009 global financial crisis. Tri-party repos were, for example, a major source of se-cured funding for Bear Sterns prior to its demise. In March 2008, repo lenders in general, and <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> counterparties in particular, lost confidence in their ability to recoup loans to Bear Stearns and, hence, refused to renew them, asking instead for immediate repayment (Bernanke 2008). To avoid a failure, the Federal Reserve facilitated the acquisition of Bear Stearns by the bank J. P. Morgan Chase. The withdrawal of <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> funding also played a role in the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. As a result of the events during the crisis, it is now widely believed that the <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> market is subject to serious vulnerability (see, for example, Dudley [2009]). Attesting to this is the fact that in 2009 the NewYork Fed asked a group of senior private U. S. bank officials to form a task force “to address the weaknesses ” in the I would like to thank Jeff Lacker for many stimulating conversations that motivated me to write this article, Jim Peck for answering my game theory questions patiently, and Bory...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the pricing {{determinants}} in the systemically important <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> market. Taking advantage of the recently available N-MFP reports led by money market funds, we construct a novel dataset that contains <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> transactions between money market funds and dealer banks. We nd a large cross-sectional heterogeneity in repo pricing, re ected most signicantly in the haircuts of repos backed by equity and corporate bonds. Surprisingly, it is the fund families, not bank dealers, who are the dominant factor in determining the pricing. Moreover, the repo market exhibits signicant segmentation, with fund families adopting three dierent pricing schemes: counter-party sensitive, counter-party and collateral sensitive, and uniform. Most fund families use uniform haircuts by xing a constant haircut, which itself varies across families, for all repos within each asset class, regardless {{of the quality of}} collateral or counter-party. Investigating further on the lending/borrowing relationship between fund families and dealers, we nd that, when faced with such a rich pricing pattern, dealers do not shop around for a better haircut and are inclined to maintain a stable relationship with their lenders. Finally, for repos backed by Treasury securities, there is little variation in both haircuts and spreads, regardless of the fund family...|$|E

The present paper develops a dynamic equilibrium model and analyzes under what conditions such instability can be a consequence of market-wide changes in expectations.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a dynamic model {{of financial institutions}} that borrow short-term and invest into long-term marketable assets. Because such intermediaries perform maturity transformation, {{they are subject to}} potential runs. We derive distinct liquidity and collateral constraints that characterize the fragility of such institutions as a result of changing market expectations. The liquidity constraint depends on the intermediary’s endogenous liquidity position that acts as a buffer against runs. The collateral constraint depends crucially on the microstructure of particular funding markets that we examine in detail.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} risk of fire sales in the <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> market, a large and {{important}} market where securities dealers find short-term funding for {{a substantial portion of}} their own and their clients' assets. We distinguish between fire sales of assets by a dealer who, facing a run that could lead to default, sells securities to generate liquidity, and fire sales of assets by repo investors after a dealer's default has occurred. While fire sales do cause damage no matter how they arise, the tools available to lessen the harm from the two types of fire sales are different. We find that limited tools are available to mitigate {{the risk of}} pre-default fire sales and that no established tools currently exist to mitigate the risk of post-default sales...|$|E

Significant changes in the regulation of money-market funds are under consideration. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates the central clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives, although a pending exemption of foreign exchange derivatives remains to be decided.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents two essays {{to study}} both theoretically and empirically {{the interaction of}} short-term funding and the banking system {{and its effects on}} systemic risk. Before its collapse in September 2008, Lehman Brothers had been using the repurchase agreement (repo) market to hide up to $ 50 billion from their balance sheet {{at the end of each}} quarter. When this "Repo 105 " scheme was uncovered (a type of strategy called window dressing), the Securities and Exchange Commission conducted an inquiry into public US financial institutions and concluded that Lehman was an isolated case. Using confidential regulatory data on daily repo transactions from July 2008 to July 2014, in my first essay, I show that non-US banks continue to remove an average of $ 170 billion from the US <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> market every quarter-end. This amount is more than double the $ 76 billion market-wide drop in <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> during the turmoil of the 2008 financial crisis and represents about 10 % of the entire <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> market. Window dressing induced deleveraging spills over into agency bond markets and money market funds and affects market quality each quarter. Demand deposit contracts provide liquidity to investors; however by their nature they can expose the issuer to self-fulfilling runs. Existing models treat depositors as agents facing uncertain liquidity shocks, who seek to insure against that liquidity risk through use of a bank financed solely by deposits. Welfare-reducing bank runs then arise from the inherent difficulties depositors face in coordinating their withdrawals. My second essay extends the classic model of Diamond & Dybvig (1983) to allow for a more realistic mixed capital structure where the bank's investments are partly financed by equity, and where differing incentives between shareholders and depositors are allowed to operate. I also further extend the model to allow shareholders to choose the level of risk in bank-financed projects. I compute the ex-ante probability of a bank run in consideration of the bank capital ratio, and I additionally compute the level of bank risk chosen by utility-maximizing shareholders who are disciplined by uncoordinated depositors. I find that even in the absence of bank negotiating power of the form in Diamond & Rajan (2000), banks can be welfare-improving institutions, and there exists a socially optimal level of bank capital. I consider the policies of a minimum capital requirement, deposit insurance, and suspension of convertibility, and provide guidance on creating optimal bank regulation. I show that the level of bank capital involves a tradeoff between sharing portfolio risk and sharing liquidity risk. Increased bank capital results in less risk-sharing between shareholders and depositors. The demand deposit contract disciplines the bank and its shareholders, and equity capital in effect disciplines the depositors (by making runs less likely). There is a socially optimal level of natural bank capital, even when I make no further social planner restrictions on bank portfolio choice in the model...|$|E
40|$|Contracting {{conventions}} for repurchase agreements, or repos, {{changed significantly}} in the 1980 s. The growth of the repo market, new uses for repos, {{and the emergence of}} new and previously unappreciated risks prompted market participants to revise their contracting conventions. This article describes the evolution of the conventions during that period, focusing on three key developments: the recognition of accrued interest on repo securities, a change in the application of federal bankruptcy law to repos, and the accelerated growth of a new form of repo-tri-party repo. The author argues that the emergence of <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> owed to the efforts of individual market participants acting in their own economic self-interest. By comparison, recognition of accrued interest and the change in bankruptcy law were effected, respectively, by participants taking collective action and seeking legislative relief because uncoordinated, individual solutions would have been more costly. These developments offer important insights into how markets operate: contracting conventions that are efficient in one market environment may have to be revised when the environment changes, and institutional arrangements can change in any number of ways. Repurchase agreements; Contracts...|$|E
40|$|This primer {{provides}} {{a detailed description}} of the GCF Repo Service, a financial service provided by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. The primer is composed of an introductory note and two separate papers. The first paper focuses on the clearance and settlement of GCF Repo. These financial plumbing details are especially important because the settlement of GCF Repo has been and will continue to be impacted by the current reforms to the <b>tri-party</b> <b>repo</b> settlement platform. In particular, the authors lay out the various ways that intraday credit was used pre-reform to facilitate the settlement of GCF Repo and why this use of credit is problematic. They also describe the reforms that are planned or in effect already, and consider how these reforms affect the use of intraday credit. The second paper examines how dealers use the GCF Repo Service. The authors first describe the various strategies that dealers employ when trading GCF Repo and then use empirical analysis to quantify the predominance of these str ategies. Although they focus on different aspects of the GCF Repo Service, the two papers are complementary. This is because the strategies that dealers follow in trading GCF Repos are influenced by the clearance and settlement procedures in place. Furthermore, when gauging the risks of potential changes to the clearance and settlement of GCF Repo, it is important to take into account how GCF Repos are traded. Consequently, the papers are presented jointly so as to encourage readers to become familiar with both aspects of the GCF Repo Service...|$|E
