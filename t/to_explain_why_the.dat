5|$|Two {{months before}} the war's end, on 7 March 1945, when the Allied armies crossed the Rhine and entered German territory, Friedrich Kellner tried <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> German people {{themselves}} had not rebelled against Nazi rule, why {{it was necessary for}} outside forces to rid the Germans of the tyrannical government they themselves had voted into power.|$|E
5|$|Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847 {{published}} his important work on {{conservation of energy}} in part of which he used those principles <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> oscillation dies away, {{that it is the}} resistance of the circuit which dissipates the energy of the oscillation on each successive cycle. Helmholtz also noted that there was evidence of oscillation from the electrolysis experiments of William Hyde Wollaston. Wollaston was attempting to decompose water by electric shock but found that both hydrogen and oxygen were present at both electrodes. In normal electrolysis they would separate, one to each electrode.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 the {{physicist}} Niels Bohr proposed {{a model in}} which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only {{do so in a}} finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. This quantization was used <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see synchrotron radiation) and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.|$|E

Doubts about the reliability of indices indicating housing-market trends have exacerbated the difficulties of actors {{in the market and}} have impeded appropriate policy responses by government.

40|$|The ‘‘jurisdiction’’ culture, {{originated}} under Pietro Leopoldo, {{represents a}} common denominator for the Tuscan ruling-class during the Nation-building era. Thereby, territorial belonging and political stability emerge as key {{features of the}} Tuscan notabilate during the period {{between the end of}} Italian Uniication and World War I. This contributes <b>to</b> <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> beginning of 20 th century marks in Tuscany a phase of great decline and isolation from the power-holding centres...|$|R
50|$|The genre predates the {{mainstream}} popularity {{of science fiction}} proper, and does not necessarily feature any scientific rigor, being instead romantic tales of high adventure. For example, little thought is given <b>to</b> <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> environment of the alien planet is compatible with life from Earth, just that it does {{in order to allow}} the hero to move about and interact with the natives. Native technology will often break the known laws of physics.|$|R
5|$|Van der Byl {{took over}} {{at a time when}} South Africa was putting {{increasing}} pressure on the Rhodesians to make an agreement on majority rule. In March 1975, he had to fly urgently to Cape Town <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Rhodesian government had detained Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole of the Zimbabwe African National Union, who was accused of plotting against other black nationalist leaders. The South Africans were extremely displeased with this action and suspected that the real reason was that the Rhodesians objected to Sithole and preferred to negotiate with Joshua Nkomo. Van der Byl was unsuccessful in reassuring the South Africans and Ian Smith was forced to follow him.|$|E
5|$|While {{scholars}} {{have proposed a}} number of hypotheses <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> poem was written, a definitive {{answer to this question}} remains elusive. But regardless of Proba's intent, there is evidence that the poem was widely circulated, and it eventually was used in schools to teach the tenets of Christianity, alongside Augustine of Hippo's De Doctrina Christiana. Critical reception to the poem, however, was more mixed. A pseudonymous work purportedly by Pope Gelasius I disparaged the poem, deeming it apocryphal. Many also believe that St. Jerome disliked the poem. At the same time, others like Isidore of Seville, Petrarch, and Giovanni Boccaccio wrote highly of Proba. During the 19th and 20th centuries the poem was criticized as being of poor quality, but recent {{scholars have}} written more positively about it.|$|E
5|$|Francis Parkman, an American {{historian}} {{who was one}} of the first to write about natives within the colonial historical narrative, argues that the Iroquois wars “were products of an ‘insensate fury’ and ‘mad ambition’". He said that the Iroquois waged wars due to the extinction of the beaver, their growing dependence on European goods, and resentment at the extermination of native culture. Parkman argues that the Iroquois had become so dependent on European goods that they needed these items in order to survive. In his research, Parkman had no evidence to support his claims. He assumed that the natives’ culture was inferior to the British-American, and overlooked potential reasons for the Iroquois attacks. Parkman’s interpretation neglected <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Iroquois had waged war against other native groups as well. Parkman’s view would later on be dismissed due to its ethnocentric interpretation of the events.|$|E

If it is acceptable to contribute to jihad by writing for and producing magazines, then it must also acceptable for magazine readers to contribute to jihad in less-lethal ways, perhaps recruitment and fund raising.

5|$|The astronomical {{phenomena}} {{of the solar}} eclipse and lunar eclipse had been observed in the 4th century BC by astronomers Gan De and Shi Shen; the latter gave instructions on predicting the eclipses based on the relative position of the Moon to the Sun. The philosopher Wang Chong argued against the 'radiating influence' theory of Jing Fang's writing in the 1st century BC and that of Zhang Heng (78–139); the latter two correctly hypothesized that {{the brightness of the}} Moon was merely light reflected from the Sun. Jing Fang had written in the 1st century BC of how it was long accepted in China that the Sun and Moon were spherical in shape ('like a crossbow bullet'), not flat. Shen Kuo also wrote of solar and lunar eclipses in this manner, yet expanded upon this <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> celestial bodies were spherical, going against the 'flat earth' theory for celestial bodies. However, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that Shen Kuo supported a round earth theory, which was introduced into Chinese science by Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi in the 17th century. When the Director of the Astronomical Observatory asked Shen Kuo if the shapes of the Sun and Moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained that celestial bodies were spherical because of knowledge of waxing and waning of the Moon. Much like what Zhang Heng had said, Shen Kuo likened the Moon to a ball of silver, which does not produce light, but simply reflects light if provided from another source (the Sun). He explained that when the Sun's light is slanting, the Moon appears full. He then explained if one were to cover any sort of sphere with white powder, and then viewed from the side it would appear to be a crescent, hence he reasoned that celestial bodies were spherical. He also wrote that, although the Sun and Moon were in conjunction and opposition with each other once a month, this did not mean the Sun would be eclipsed every time their paths met, because of the small obliquity of their orbital paths.|$|E

50|$|A date in {{the early}} nineteenth century {{therefore}} seems much more sensible than the eighteenth century.

25|$|Biblical {{scholars}} have studied inconsistencies in and between texts and canons {{as a means}} to study the bible and the societies that created and influenced it.

25|$|The {{monetary}} explanation has two weaknesses.

Second {{it is not}} able to explain why in March 1933 a recovery took place although short term interest rates remained close to zero and the Money supply was still falling. These questions are addressed by modern explanations that build on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz but add non-monetary explanations.|$|E
50|$|Primacy, {{the state}} of being first, usually creates a strong and durable impression.

For the student, it means that learning must be right. “Unteaching” wrong first impressions will cause confusion unless the correct version is presented logically and carefully with effort devoted <b>to</b> <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> first version is incorrect or inferior.|$|R
