5|$|The {{formation}} of planetesimals {{is the biggest}} unsolved problem in the nebular disk model. How 1cm sized particles coalesce into 1km planetesimals is a mystery. This mechanism {{appears to be the}} key to <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>as</b> to why some stars have planets, while others have nothing around them, not even dust belts.|$|E
5|$|According to the Big Bang theory, the Universe {{originated}} {{in an extremely}} hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago and began expanding rapidly. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through space. The matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms {{what is now called}} outer space. As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe. This leaves open <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>as</b> to whether the Universe is finite or infinite.|$|E
5|$|In the Commonwealth context, too, Britain {{knew that}} simply {{granting}} independence to Southern Rhodesia {{was out of}} <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>as</b> many of the Afro-Asian countries were also Commonwealth members. Statehood for Salisbury without majority rule would split the Commonwealth and perhaps cause it to break up, a disastrous prospect for British foreign policy. The Commonwealth repeatedly called on Britain to intervene directly should Southern Rhodesian defiance continue, while liberals in Britain worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style apartheid. Anxious {{to avoid having to}} choose between Southern Rhodesia and the Commonwealth, Whitehall attempted to negotiate a middle way between the two, but ultimately put international considerations first, regarding them as more important.|$|E

5|$|In the South West Pacific, a {{conventional}} strategic bombing campaign {{was out of}} <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> <b>as</b> industrial targets in Japan were well beyond the range of even the largest strategic bombers operating from bases in Australia and New Guinea. Therefore, the primary mission of the Allied bomber force was interdiction of Japanese supply lines, especially the sea lanes. The results of the effort against the Japanese convoy in January were very disappointing; some 416 sorties had been flown with only two ships sunk and three damaged, so clearly, a change of tactics was in order. Group Captain Bill Garing, an RAAF officer on Kenney’s staff with considerable experience in air-sea operations, including a {{tour of duty in}} Europe, recommended that Japanese convoys be subjected to simultaneous attack from different altitudes and directions.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{hypopituitarism}} is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and some also an increased risk of death of about 50% to 150% the normal population. It has been difficult to establish which hormone deficiency is responsible for this risk, as almost all patients studied had growth hormone deficiency. The studies also do not answer <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>as</b> to whether the hypopituitarism itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as sex hormone supplementation) have a recognized adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tony follows Chastity into a cave in {{the woods}} and stumbles upon a bizarre shaft of light. Once Tony steps into the light, he is possessed with the same {{abilities}} that Max and Chastity have, the ability to vibrate at high frequencies, allowing Tony to move faster than normal vision can detect. At the same time, however, Max collapses and is sent to the hospital where it is found he is suffering from exhaustion, withdrawal, a concussion, muscular tears and skeletal fractures - basically, his abilities are killing him. Mulder eventually deduces that he possesses superhuman speed. Chastity sneaks Max out of the hospital where he returns to the cave (even though she suggested they go somewhere else for help but Max refused). Later, the sheriff finds the flashlight in Max's room and confronts his son about the murders. Max confesses and then attempts to kill his father, but Tony intervenes, taking the sheriff's gun; the sheriff is promptly taken to the hospital. That night, Tony and Chastity head to the cave so that Max won't use up any more of the remaining power. Once there, Chastity has been knocked unconscious by Max, who then confronts Tony, using his abilities to take back the gun before throwing it away. However, Chastity (having come to and using her abilities) takes the gun and shoots Max from behind, then allows herself to be shot by the same bullet; she tells Tony that she can't go back to the way things were before. Afterwards, Tony is seen in the hospital recuperating while numerous geological experts examined the cave, but were unable to identify anything unusual. The city then fills the cave with concrete, sealing it forever, leaving <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>as</b> to what caused the teenager-related ability a mystery.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} whether the Quran is eternal or created became a {{theological}} debate (Quran's createdness) in the ninth century. Mu'tazilas, an Islamic school of theology based on reason and rational thought, held that the Quran was created while the most widespread varieties of Muslim theologians considered the Quran to be co-eternal with God and therefore uncreated. Sufi philosophers view <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>as</b> artificial or wrongly framed.|$|E
25|$|According to one {{influential}} school, {{the human}} vocal apparatus is intrinsically digital {{on the model}} of a keyboard or digital computer. If so, this is remarkable: nothing about a chimpanzee's vocal apparatus suggests a digital keyboard, notwithstanding the anatomical and physiological similarities.

25|$|There is also <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>as</b> {{to whether}} having {{children}} really {{is such a}} positive contribution {{to the world in}} an age when there are many concerns about overpopulation, pollution and depletion of non-renewable resources. Some critics counter that such analyses of having children may understate its potential benefits to society (e.g. a greater labor force, which may provide greater opportunity to solve social problems) and overstate the costs. That is, there is often a need for a non-zero birth rate.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Australia’s public {{transport}} unions resolved {{that the impact}} of changes in the {{public transport}} industry was such that it would be to their members’ benefit to amalgamate into a single union. The national and state branches of the ARU, ATMOEA, AFULE and NURWA consequently balloted their members on <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>as</b> to whether they favoured amalgamation, in which over 85% of their combined members voted ‘Yes’. As a result, these unions amalgamated into a single Public Transport Union (PTU) in February 1993.|$|E

In late 2009, President of Serbia Boris Tadić pardoned Zoran Stojanović, declaring that the trial was unjust, which opened <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>as</b> to whether he had jurisdiction because Stojanović was sentenced by an international High court. Stojanović's ethnic Albanian wife {{and their two children}} have been exposed to intensified intimidation, most notably because other Albanians consider her a traitor for marrying a Serb.
