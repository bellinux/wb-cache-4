Blige, due to Hamilton rapping, [...] "OK, call me irresponsible and immature, but you're beautiful, {{what the hell}} else would I hit it for? Now I can say that I hit it raw, but {{that would mean that}} you will have to get an abor, or I just not need to go there", clarifying at some point at that past time that Hamilton had got Latrise pregnant but for undisclosed reasons Latrise would have an abortion. On May 25, 2009, during an interview, they both publicly apologized to each other, with Hamilton stating, [...] "I apologize honestly for putting some things out there that shouldn't have been out there. I understand it; it was the heat of the moment, and I didn't get the chance to really talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I {{just wanted to tell you}} I apologize because I know what I shouldn't have said", and with Latrise remarking, [...] "I'm going to thank you for your apology. I'm going to apologize for acting outside of the norm. We're going to talk about our personal business, on our personal time." ...|$|E

60|$|GEORGE. Mother, I'd like <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>You</b> don't understand.|$|R
6000|$|Kramer smiled. Then {{he became}} serious. [...] "Professor, there's a project we're {{working on that}} I want <b>to</b> talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about.</b> <b>It's</b> the first ray of hope we've had in this whole war. If it works, {{we may be able}} to crack the yuk defenses, get some ships into their system. If we can do that the war might be brought to an end." ...|$|R
50|$|Jétais pour te le dire. (Jallais te le dire. / Jétais sur le point de te le dire.) I was going/about <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Holmes {{thought a}} little and then burst out laughing. [...] "No, don't," [...] said he; [...] "I shall write <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> No tricks, now, or--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I heard Mr. Bathurst saying {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> yesterday, Miss Hannay. He is an enthusiast; we like him very much, but we don't {{see much of}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I'll mention it," [...] said Mrs. Touchett. [...] "I shall {{say nothing}} more <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but I give you notice I shall talk to others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, then! Is {{that what}} he wished <b>to</b> see <b>you</b> <b>about?</b> <b>It</b> was {{understood}} {{that he was not}} to allude again to the subject to any one." ...|$|R
60|$|Mister, {{have you}} ever had a real shock--something that came out of nowhere and just knocked you flat? I have, and I'm going <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{trust you}} a bit, Basil," [...] she lamented. [...] "Now, I will explain <b>to</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I've thought {{the whole thing}} over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jack, you can't be too careful. I've {{wanted to}} speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Snap will ride in here some day and then--" [...] Dave's pause was not reassuring.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Sir John, {{with great}} deliberation, [...] "I think I see my way; but I must {{have time to}} think of it. I will speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I presume," [...] {{said the}} elder woman, [...] "that he's talked <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He never tells me much. I don't {{see why you}} should want to go. What's it like?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But what? I suppose young Trendellsohn {{has been}} talking <b>to</b> <b>you</b> again <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I suppose he {{suspects}} me; if so, no doubt, you will suspect me too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They do. Sit down, Philip, and hear. I wanted <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> They know it. Poor Laura was {{so unhappy}} {{when you were}} ill, that mamma made it out from her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a paper," [...] Tommy said, nervous yet elated, and {{addressing}} all, [...] "that Grizel {{put in the}} coffin. She told me <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> when the cords fell on the lid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I've spoken <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Mrs. Pope," [...] he said, [...] "I {{can tell}} you just how I--oh, it's the only word--adore her. She seems so sweet and easy--so graceful----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Having got {{the glove}} in so solemn a way," [...] he went on, [...] "it {{would have been}} ill done of me to blab <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Do you see that now, woman?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. But he {{said that}} he felt the danger which lay for him in your generosity. Of course he will write <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Do you not think better of him for his resolve?" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. G. He {{had put his}} cup down on {{the ground}} then, and he {{literally}} stepped into it. Some of the tea spirted over my dress--the gray one. I meant <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> before.|$|R
60|$|DEAR AUNT SUE,--Imagine how I felt <b>to</b> {{find that}} <b>you</b> had {{actually}} gone off without filling my traveling ink stand which you gave me! I found it out yesterday. Livy advised me <b>to</b> write <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye," [...] said Mr. Poyser, looking jocose; [...] "but thee dostna tell Adam {{what he said}} <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> one day.

6000|$|... "My news is bad news, sir," [...] Strong answered; [...] "it {{concerns}} {{our friends}} at Tunbridge Wells, and I {{should like to}} talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Clavering is at his old tricks again, Major Pendennis." ...|$|E
6000|$|Leland {{showed some}} little embarrassment. [...] "I did. I {{was going to}} talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> {{in a day or}} two, because it wouldn't be quite {{convenient}} to have Mrs. Heaton out from Chicago just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Peter, old man," [...] said James, [...] "I've {{been meaning}} to speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for some time. I've got Sandy MacBean's new book, and I {{think you ought to}} read it. It is full of helpful hints." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{would have}} been one of you, had I lived. I can talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> more <b>about</b> <b>it</b> now, Martin, than I ever could before, because I know I feel I am dying." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Answer my questions, please. I've spoken <b>to</b> <b>you</b> once <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Do <b>you</b> {{think you}} are {{performing}} your duty as a wife, enjoying yourself in Dresden and Berlin while your husband is working hard in Detroit?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Well, I don't {{suppose it}} matters. She doesn't know I'm {{speaking}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> that; <b>it</b> just {{came into my}} head. I like to help in a worthy object, you know. I hope you'll have a good night's rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense! I {{will trust}} you. There {{is a little}} {{difficulty}} in the way which I haven't mentioned yet. It's {{a matter of some}} delicacy, and I want <b>to</b> consult <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Between ourselves, I have had private opportunities with Miss Gwilt--" ...|$|R
