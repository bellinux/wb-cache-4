The higher temperatures and tendency of oil <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> skin make spilled hot cooking oil far more dangerous than spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their hands {{on top of the}} stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|E
5|$|The manga was {{not popular}} initially. Although he {{suspected}} the fighting genre would appeal more to its shōnen audience, Toriyama tried <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Journey to the West adventure aspect which he himself enjoyed. Such {{as having the}} setting change each chapter, different enemies popping up, and different locations. It was only after he became tired of Torishima nagging about its popularity that Toriyama gave in and developed more battles with the first shown Tenkaichi Budōkai. Despite his reluctance, the author said it felt good when the series picked up in popularity at that point. However, he said he still tried to resist by returning to the adventure aspect with the Red Ribbon Army arc, and visiting Penguin Village from Dr. Slump to add comedy. When that did not work out, fighting became the main theme for the manga.|$|E
5|$|The {{parasite}} {{is relatively}} protected from {{attack by the}} body's immune system because {{for most of its}} human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the spleen. To avoid this fate, the P.falciparum parasite displays adhesive proteins {{on the surface of the}} infected blood cells, causing the blood cells <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen. The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria. Sequestered red blood cells can breach the blood–brain barrier and cause cerebral malaria.|$|E

30|$|We {{developed}} a numerical model allowing <b>to</b> access <b>the</b> effectiveness of measures implemented <b>to</b> counteract <b>the</b> formation of rings in a rotary cement kiln in use by Almatis B.V. in Rotterdam. In this three-dimensional combustion model, the gas flow, the temperature profile, radiative heat distribution and {{the concentration of}} hydro-carbon species in the kiln is taken into account. Simulations show that deluting the air-fuel mixture with air reduces peaks in radiative heat transfer in zones critical to ring formation. This reduction results in turn in less heat being absorbed by the granular material bed, effectively {{reducing the amount of}} material liquid phase prone <b>to</b> <b>sticking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kiln’s surface and <b>to</b> forming rings. <b>The</b> validity of our model has been experimental observed at the Almatis plant in Rotterdam. Since August 28 th, 2011, the kiln has been operation without unscheduled shut-downs, resulting in hugely important cost savings.|$|R

5|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) visits Harry Prentice (Wilford Brimley), {{the elderly}} and bed-ridden father of his friend Chuckie (Michael Chaban). Ill and miserable, the hard-bitten Harry has decided he wants to die and has hired a suicide doctor. Felton {{believes}} this is wrong and convinces Chuckie to call it off, much to Harry's anger. A few days later, however, Harry wears Chuckie down and convinces his son to shoot him {{to death with a}} handgun. When Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) investigate, Chuckie claims Harry shot himself, which Lewis does not believe. Felton talks to Chuckie at the police station and Chuckie admits to the assisted suicide, but Felton tells him <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original suicide story. Lewis realizes what happened and confronts Felton, who admits what Chuckie did and suggests {{it was the right thing}} to do, but Lewis adamantly disagrees. Since the bullet evidence is inconclusive, Felton asks Lewis to let Chuckie secretly wash his hands so no gunpowder residue will be found in tests. Lewis initially refuses, but he eventually reluctantly agrees, allowing Chuckie to get away with the shooting.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March, the Soviet 40th Army counterattacked {{against the}} Großdeutschland Division {{in a final}} attempt to restore {{communications}} with the 3rd Tank Army. This counterattack, however, was caught by {{the expansion of the}} German offensive towards Kharkov on 10 March. That same day, the 4th Panzer Army issued orders to the SS Panzer Corps to take Kharkov as soon as possible, prompting Hausser to order an immediate attack on the city by the three SS Panzer divisions. The Das Reich would come from the West, the LSSAH would attack from north, and the Totenkopf would provide a protective screen along the north and northwestern flanks. Despite attempts by General Hoth to order Hausser <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original plan, the SS Panzer Corps' commander decided to continue with his own plan of attack on the city, although Soviet defenses forced him to postpone the attack until the next day. Manstein issued an order to continue outflanking the city, although leaving room for a potential attack on Kharkov if there was little Soviet resistance, but Hausser decided to disregard the order and continue with his own assault.|$|E

Only three songs that had previously been written survived the cut, and the band relentlessly pumped out another nine original songs throughout the end of 2006. The philosophy was simple - <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> what <b>the</b> band does best, which is to write and perform high-energy ska-influenced music that combines elements of reggae, punk and rock & roll.|$|R

25|$|When Welsh {{returned}} to America he {{was intent on}} fighting Ritchie, having failed to meet both Nelson and Wolgast. He employed the services of Harry Pollok, one of New York's most flamboyant sports impresarios. When Welsh and Fanny arrived in New York on 29 March 1913, Pollok was there orchestrating the reporters and photographers. Even with Pollack's help Ritchie was difficult to commit. Champions tended <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> East Coast, fighting in six round contests where the 'no-decision' contests meant {{the only way the}} title could be lost would be through a knockout. When Welsh arrived in New York, Billy Dolan, Ritchie's manager, announced that the champion would not be fighting for four months as he was touring Europe to fulfil theatrical commitments. Welsh busied himself through fights, preparing for a possible title bid.|$|E
25|$|Having {{covered all}} {{possible}} routes Hannibal could take {{to leave the}} plain, Fabius sat tight, observing the Carthaginian army but doing nothing to force a decisive engagement. With this strategy Fabius kept his army safe but his political position began to suffer in Rome. His staff and the Roman senate demanded swift action to crush Hannibal since the Carthaginians were already trapped. When L. Hostilius Mancinus, sent to scout the Numidians with 400 horsemen dared to engage the Carthaginians, he was killed and his entire force destroyed by the Carthaginian cavalry under Carthalo, prompting the Romans <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waiting game for the time being.

The council slightly softened its policy on 28 March, declaring that it was only deferring making a rate and committing to making a legal rate in due course; a motion <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> previous formula was defeated by 32 to 24. The council having ignored the High Court's interlocutory declaration, Mourad Fleming's judicial review application proceeded to trial on 1 April; Fleming agreed to vary an order and let the council use borrowing powers in the 1985/86 financial year, but said that he would ask the court to appoint a receiver to run the council if no rate was set. At the end of the hearing, Mr Justice Woolf found both Hackney's resolutions of 7 and 28 March unlawful and quashed them but refused to immediately order the council to set a rate.

He also led the team to an appearance in Super Bowl XVIII the following year, and would go on to set several Redskins franchise records, including most career passing attempts (3,602), most career passing completions (2,044) and most career passing yards (25,206), while also throwing 160 touchdown passes, with 138 interceptions. On the ground, he rushed for 1,815 yards and 17 touchdowns. He was named NFL MVP in 1983 by four organizations. He earned the Player of the Game Award in the second of his two Pro Bowl appearances.
