Products such as the BK Veggie, a meatless burger initially introduced in 2002, target the female and health-oriented demographic using a co-branded marketing program and a patty produced by the Kellogg Company's Morningstar Farms division. Another sub-market in this group is on-the-go parents and commuters; The company's BK Chicken Fries—French-fry cut pieces of breaded chicken—is specifically targeted to this segment.

The meal was launched with a cross-promotion in conjunction with Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants.
