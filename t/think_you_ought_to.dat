500|$|... {{with the}} present frightfully low prices of iron and steel rails it is utterly {{impossible}} for us to advance wages at all... Our steel works, as everybody knows, are now idle because we have no work to do there. Until the reduction of ten per cent on the 10th of this month {{there has been no}} reduction in your wages for nearly a year, while during that time there has been a falling off in the prices we get for iron and steel of over twenty-five per cent. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> consider these things fully and reflect whether the little work we can give you is not better than no work at all. I assure you when prices will warrant it we shall be very glad to pay wages in proportion.|$|E
2500|$|The next morning, Dwyer went to {{his press}} conference as planned. Appearing nervous and agitated, he again professed his innocence and began reading from a 21 page {{prepared}} text later described as a [...] "rambling polemic about the criminal justice system". It singled out former Governor Thornburgh, Acting U.S. Attorney West, agents in the FBI, Judge Muir, and others for tarnishing the justice system and ruining him. Dwyer spoke out {{against the death penalty}} and expressed regret for voting in favor of it {{while he was in the}} Pennsylvania assembly. This speech lasted nearly 30 minutes, and approximately halfway into it, with no apparent end in sight, some of the gathered press began to pack up and leave. Dwyer spotted this and interrupted himself to say, [...] "Those of you who are putting your cameras away, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> stay because we're not, we're not finished yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|The censor, the Lord Chamberlain, {{hastened to}} see the show, and demanded changes. After an {{uncertain}} start, the revue was a huge success; the song [...] "We don't want to lose you, but we <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> go", encouraging young men to join the army, was a particular hit for Delysia. Within weeks the other items in the triple bill were dropped, and Odds and Ends was expanded to a full evening, with only a brief curtain raiser. Within two months of the opening, Delysia was an established star, invited to take part with Muriel Foster, Charles Hawtrey, Oscar Asche and Isidore de Lara in a charity matinée attended by Queen Alexandra. It {{was the first of}} many charity appearances that Delysia made during the war. Her biographer Anne Pimlott Baker writes that Delysia entertained wounded troops, and took many French refugees and orphans into her home. In 1916, she made her film début, and took a leading role in SHE, an adaptation of the Rider Haggard story, about a woman's passion for a young traveller.|$|E

6000|$|The Judge ruminated a bit, {{scratching}} his chin. [...] "Well, now, I'll tell yeh, Mrs. Brown and I {{had a little}} talk about the matter last night, and she <b>thinks</b> I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> lend <b>you</b> the money, and--she <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> take it. So pack up y'r duds in September and start in." ...|$|R

6000|$|Ludlow {{assumed that}} she had said more. [...] "Then if you don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do it for that, do you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do it for nothing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> know," [...] {{she said}} suddenly.

6000|$|... "Ah, that's {{because they}} want to be!" [...] And Isabel lightly laughed. Her suitor's countenance fell, and he looked at her for a while in silence. [...] "I'm afraid it's my being an Englishman that makes you hesitate," [...] he said presently. [...] "I know your uncle <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> marry in your own country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is very evident," [...] I said. [...] "But your {{daughter}} <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> take her home." [...] I began to fear, {{as soon as}} I had uttered these words, that they savoured of treachery to the young lady, but I was reassured by seeing that they produced on her mother's placid countenance no symptom whatever of irritation.|$|R
6000|$|... "But he {{says that}} he's got the captain's name to the five hundred pounds; and he means to get it some of these days, now that the captain and his father are friends again. The long and the short of it is, that he wants five hundred pounds by hook or by crook, and that he <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> let him have it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My dear Dick," [...] Mrs. Dennant {{said to him}} a {{fortnight}} later, [...] "we would rather, after you leave here, that you don't {{see each other again}} until July. Of course I know you count it an engagement and all that, and everybody's been writin' to congratulate <b>you.</b> But Algie <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> give yourselves a chance.

Why; it'd pay all the debts, and leave the property worth twice what it ever was before. If Lord Cashel <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> give up the hounds, do it at once, Frank; anything rather than quarrel with him. You could get them again, you know, when all's settled." ...|$|R
