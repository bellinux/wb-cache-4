25|$|Anyone who {{can gain}} Administrators access can overwrite, {{override}} {{or change the}} Data Recovery Agent configuration. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious</b> issue, since an attacker can for example hack the Administrator account (using third-party tools), set whatever DRA certificate they want as the Data Recovery Agent and wait. This is {{sometimes referred to as}} a two-stage attack, which is a significantly different scenario than the risk due to a lost or stolen PC, but which highlights the risk due to malicious insiders.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} value has been met with positive critical response. Silverman praised the film's animation, stating that [...] "the movie is gorgeous, {{and not just}} for theatrical animation." [...] Silverman also praised the cast, most notably Yuri's voice actors. EGMnow also gave high praise to the animation calling it [...] "beautiful and rich" [...] and said [...] "It is top-of-the-line in artwork, artistic style and coloring. The action sequences, though reminiscent of the game, are not repetitive nor silly. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious</b> movie and it was treated as such." [...] The Fandom Post agreed saying [...] "the feature has some absolutely stunning visuals which create lush and vibrant environments for the characters to live in which adds a wonderful polish to the work." [...] Similar praise was given by Jeffrey Kauffman from Blu-ray.com. Andy Hanley praised the distinctive character designs despite criticizing some aspects from the fight scenes.|$|E

60|$|GILBERT. Yes: it {{has been}} said by one whose gracious memory we all revere, and the music of whose pipe once lured Proserpina from her Sicilian fields, and made those white feet stir, and not in vain, the Cumnor cowslips, that the proper aim of Criticism is to see the object as in itself it really is. But <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious</b> error, and takes no cognisance of Criticism's most perfect form, which is in its essence purely subjective, and seeks to reveal its own secret and not the secret of another. For the highest Criticism deals with art not as {{expressive}} but as impressive purely.|$|E

Your story of the drawing up of the second note would not be worth anything as evidence in a court of law--and we have nothing to hope from Jacob Patterson's clemency. No doubt he believes that he really holds Father's unpaid note. He is not a dishonest man; in fact, he rather prides himself on having made all his money honestly. He will exact every penny of the debt. The first {{thing to do is to}} have another thorough search for the lost note--although I am afraid that it is a forlorn hope." ...|$|E

I have the highest opinion of your friend's judgment and sense, but I own that I feel extremely uneasy at the thought that she has, so to speak, pitted herself against one of the most unscrupulous villains I have ever met, whose past conduct shows that he would stop at nothing, and who is playing for a very big stake. It would be as dangerous to interfere between a tiger and his prey as to endeavor to discover the secret on which so much depends." ...|$|E
