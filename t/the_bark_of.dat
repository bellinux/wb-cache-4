5|$|At least 120 drugs {{come from}} plant sources, {{many of them}} from <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> trees. Quinine {{originates}} from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and {{was for a long}} time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria. Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects. The anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and the downy birch (Betula pubescens).|$|E
5|$|Twenty-one {{species from}} several orders of slime molds (myxomycetes) have been {{isolated}} from <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> Banksia menziesii. Over half (13) {{were from the}} order Stemonitales, and Echinosteliales and Liceales were also common. The abundance {{of the first two}} orders {{may be due to the}} acidity of the bark. Another order, the Physarales, was unusually rare—other studies have demonstrated that the order is typically abundant on <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> various species of tree around the world.|$|E

5|$|In {{some species}} of cicada, the males remain in one {{location}} and call to attract females. Sometimes several males aggregate and call in chorus. In other species, the males move {{from place to}} place, usually with quieter calls while searching for females. The Tettigarctidae differ from other cicadas in producing vibrations in the substrate rather than audible sounds. After mating, the female cuts slits into <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> a twig where she deposits her eggs.|$|E
5|$|Malaria: During {{the early}} 1940s, quinine {{was the chief}} anti-malarial drug. Made from <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> the South American cinchona tree, quinine was in short supply during the war, so {{scientists}} began searching for an alternative treatment. The test subjects allowed themselves to be bitten by malarial mosquitoes and when the fever reached its peak in three to four days, were given experimental treatments. At the University of Minnesota, twelve CPS men underwent tests to determine the recovery period for those infected with malaria. This research documented the debilitating effects {{of the disease and}} the amount of time required for a complete recovery.|$|E
5|$|Many Polistes species {{aggregate}} over winter. Polistes exclamans clump {{in rather}} large aggregations while hibernating. “These aggregations are frequently found in protected places called hibernacula {{that can be}} as varied as crevices and cracks of rocks or trunks, beneath <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> trees, between walls of buildings, or any other natural or artificial structures that provides protection during hibernation.” Although Polistes exclamans {{have been found in}} organ-pipe muddauber nests, a mud nest that can provide a certain level of protection, it is not thought to actually house hibernating Polistes exclamans over the winter.|$|E

5|$|RTI {{scientists}} Monroe Wall and Mansukh Wani synthesized anti-cancer treatments camptothecin in 1966, from <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> the Camptotheca tree, and Taxol in 1971, from a Pacific yew tree. These two drugs {{account for}} $3 {{billion a year}} in sales by pharmaceutical companies. In 1986, RTI was awarded a $4 million contract with the National Cancer Institute to conduct an eight-year clinical trial on the effects of an anti-smoking campaign. Two years later, RTI began a $4.4 million program to coordinate AIDS drug trials for the National Institutes of Health. This had grown to $26 million by 1988.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> other {{varieties}} of oak {{has traditionally been}} used in Europe for the tanning of hides though bark from other species of tree has been used elsewhere. The active ingredient, tannin, is extracted and after various preliminary treatments, the skins are immersed {{in a series of}} vats containing solutions in increasing concentrations. The tannin causes the hide to become supple, less affected by water and more resistant to bacterial attack.|$|E
5|$|Throughout history {{mandrake}}s (Mandragora officinarum) {{have been}} highly sought after for their reputed aphrodisiac properties. However, {{the roots of}} the mandrake plant also contain large quantities of the alkaloid scopolamine, which, at high doses, acts as a central nervous system depressant, and makes the plant highly toxic to herbivores. Scopolamine was later found to be medicinally used for pain management prior to and during labor; in smaller doses it is used to prevent motion sickness. One of the most well-known medicinally valuable terpenes is an anticancer drug, taxol, isolated from <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia, in the early 1960s.|$|E

5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, traditional herbal remedies {{have been used}} to treat malaria. The first effective treatment for malaria came from <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> cinchona tree, which contains quinine. After the link to mosquitos and their parasites were identified in the early twentieth century, mosquito control measures such as widespread use of the insecticide DDT, swamp drainage, covering or oiling the surface of open water sources, indoor residual spraying and use of insecticide treated nets was initiated. Prophylactic quinine was prescribed in malaria endemic areas, and new therapeutic drugs, including chloroquine and artemisinins, were used to resist the scourge. Today, artemisinin is present in every remedy applied in treatment of malaria. After introducing artemisinin as a cure administered together with other remedies, the mortality in Africa went down by a half.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Dr. Don Gregorio Chil y Naranjo {{discovered}} several incisions in some mummies that he speculated {{may have}} been used to remove the internal organs. Don Brothwell's work in 1969 confirmed that evisceration was a method used by the Guanche. Along with a team of other scientists, Brothwell conducted a pathological examination of a Guanche mummy. The examination revealed that the body had been eviscerated, then the abdominal and thoracic cavities had been packed with a mud-like substance that contained <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> a pine tree. Some sort of packing was also applied subcutaneously, but the exact make-up of this particular embalming substance is unknown.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that humans began using plant alkaloids in medical preparations as early as 3000 B.C. Although the active components of most medicinal plants have been isolated only recently (beginning in the early 19th century) these substances {{have been used as}} drugs throughout the human history in potions, medicines, teas and as poisons. For example, to combat herbivory by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, Cinchona trees produce a variety of alkaloids, the most familiar of which is quinine. Quinine is extremely bitter, making <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> the tree quite unpalatable, it is also an anti-fever agent, known as Jesuit's bark, and is especially useful in treating malaria.|$|E

5|$|Agrilus planipennis, {{commonly}} known as the emerald ash borer, is a green buprestid or jewel beetle native to northeastern Asia that feeds on ash species. Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> ash trees to emerge as adults in one to two years. In its native range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant damage to trees native to the area. Outside its native range, it is an invasive species and is highly destructive to ash trees native to northwest Europe and North America. Prior to being found in North America, very little was known about emerald ash borer in its native range; this has resulted in much of the research on its biology being focused in North America. Local governments in North America are attempting to control it by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, insecticides, and biological control.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of {{angiosperms}} and gymnosperms, the outermost layer of the trunk is the bark and is mostly composed of dead cells. It provides a thick, waterproof covering to the living inner tissue. It protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire. It is perforated by {{a large number of}} fine breathing pores called lenticels, through which oxygen diffuses. Bark is continually replaced by a living layer of cells called the cork cambium. The London plane (Platanus × acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large flakes. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> the silver birch (Betula pendula) peels off in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) the bark exudes sticky resin which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) it is a milky latex that oozes out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona officinalis) contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable. Large tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales, Cycadophyta and Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos have no true bark, but they do have an outer protective covering of some form.|$|E
5|$|Like {{almost all}} amazons, the Puerto Rican amazon is a herbivore. Its diet {{consists}} of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar {{obtained from the}} forest's canopy. The species has been recorded to consume more than 60 different materials, although its diet was historically more varied due to its larger range. Among the items it consumes are the pericarp of the seeds of sierra palm (Prestoea montana), tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa), and negra lora (Matayba domingensis); the fruits of bejuco de rana (Marcgravia sintenisii), camasey (Miconia sintenisii), cupey de altura (Clusia gundlachii), and palo de cruz (Rheedia portoricensis); the flowers of bejuco de rana, achiotillo (Alchornea latifolia), and Piptocarpha tetrantha; the leaves and twigs of cupeillo (Clusia grisebachiana), laurel sabino (Magnolia splendens), caimitillo verde (Micropholis garciniaefolia), and Piptocarpha tetrantha; <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> bejuco de rana, cupeillo, and cachimbo cumun (Psychotria berteriana); and the buds of cuaba (Inga vera). It normally selects the fruits positioned {{directly in front of}} its eyes, picking them one at a time with some rare exceptions. When feeding, it uses a foot to pick up the food. The amazon feeds in a slow, paused manner taking 8–60seconds to consume separate items.|$|E
