ABSTRACT: Various {{types of}} {{plasters}} representing various ages {{used for the}} restoration of walls and sculptures at the chapel of Amun, Temple of the Hatshepsut were examined using mineralogical techniques. Samples represent at small destroyed fragments of <b>the</b> <b>plasters</b> removed during <b>the</b> conservation of the chapel. The investigation showed various mineral compositions of <b>the</b> <b>plasters</b> and <b>the</b> evolution of the method of preparation of <b>the</b> <b>plasters</b> used for restoration of the walls of <b>the</b> monument. <b>Plasters</b> were prepared with the use of gypsum as the binding material.

50|$|The Church Commissioners owned a {{block of}} flats built by a firm of contractors. <b>The</b> <b>plastering</b> work was sub contracted. Fifteen years after the {{property}} was built {{it was found that}} <b>the</b> <b>plastering</b> work was defective. As there was no direct contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the defendants an action was brought in tort.|$|R
40|$|An {{advance of}} the study {{undertaken}} of <b>the</b> <b>plastering</b> of <b>the</b> few dwellings that still exist in the historical area of Maracaibo is presented, with a base of restoration mortar of <b>the</b> <b>plastering</b> of sandstone known as “piedra de ojo”. The mortars are made of lime with a ferruginous stone aggregate that gives them a pinkish color, with additions of ceramics, bamboo, sand, wood and straw, and kneaded with salty water from Lake Maracaib...|$|R
5|$|A {{comparison}} of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states. The {{one on the}} left has shadows and details defined in black. The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the fictive architecture each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while <b>the</b> <b>plaster</b> was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{physical}} restoration was to re-attach any areas of <b>the</b> <b>plaster</b> surface (which was approximately 5mm thick) that {{were in danger of}} separating and breaking away. This was done by injecting a polyvinylacetate resin. Earlier bronze braces that had been used to stabilise surfaces were removed in those places where they were causing cracking, and the holes filled. Pigments that appeared to be not well adhered were consolidated with the application of diluted acrylic resin.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} technique employed was fresco, {{in which}} the paint is applied to damp plaster. Michelangelo had been an apprentice in the workshop of Domenico Ghirlandaio, {{one of the most}} competent and prolific of Florentine fresco painters, {{at the time that the}} latter was employed on a fresco cycle at Santa Maria Novella and whose work was represented on the walls of the Sistine Chapel. At the outset, <b>the</b> <b>plaster,</b> , began to grow mold because it was too wet. Michelangelo had to remove it and start again. He then tried a new formula created by one of his assistants, Jacopo l'Indaco, which resisted mold and entered the Italian building tradition.|$|E
50|$|Walls {{liable to}} damp are {{sometimes}} battened and lathed {{to form an}} air cavity between the damp wall and <b>the</b> <b>plastering.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>plastered</b> skulls {{represent}} some of {{the earliest}} forms of burial practices in the southern Levant. During the Neolithic period, the deceased were often buried under the floors of their homes. Sometimes the skull was removed, and its cavities filled with plaster and painted. In order to create more lifelike faces, shells were inset for eyes, and paint was used to represent facial features, hair, and moustaches. [...] Some scholars believe that this burial practice represents an early form of ancestor worship, where <b>the</b> <b>plastered</b> skulls were used to commemorate and respect family ancestors. Other experts argue that <b>the</b> <b>plastered</b> skulls could be linked to the practice of head hunting, and used as trophies. Plastered skulls provide evidence about the earliest arts and religious practices in the ancient Near East.|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{on various}} gypsum {{plasters}} applied to different backrounds, more particularly {{by means of}} bond tensile strength measurements, scanning electron microscopy and stopping tests, yielded information on <b>the</b> dihydratetexture of <b>plasters</b> at interfaces, permitting an unambiguous interpretation of the processes involved. At the interfaces there {{are likely to be}} special dihydrate textures, which in general, however, have good bond with the interior of <b>the</b> <b>plasters.</b> With regard to the formation of this texture it must be ensured that no shear stresses can develop. This can be controlled by approriate adjustment of the degree of saturation of porous backgrounds and by means of admixtures to <b>the</b> <b>plasters...</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{a medical}} garment, metal corsets endured {{well into the}} 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable wearer of such medical corsets, {{following}} ongoing problems {{as a result of}} a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of <b>the</b> <b>plaster</b> ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, her torso split open revealing that her spine is a crumbling Ionic column, and her damaged body held together by the steel corset. A form of metal corset or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed to immobilise the waist whilst healing, and are made with two bendable metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. <b>The</b> <b>plaster</b> was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{painting}} fresco, <b>the</b> <b>plaster</b> was laid {{in a new}} section every day, called a giornata. At {{the beginning of each}} session, the edges would be scraped away and a new area laid down. The edges between giornate remain slightly visible; thus, they give a good idea of how the work progressed. It was customary for fresco painters to use a full-sized detailed drawing, a cartoon, to transfer a design onto a plaster surface—many frescoes show little holes made with a stiletto, outlining the figures. Here Michelangelo broke with convention; once confident the intonaco had been well applied, he drew directly onto the ceiling. His energetic sweeping outlines can be seen scraped into some of the surfaces, while on others a grid is evident, indicating that he enlarged directly onto the ceiling from a small drawing.|$|E
50|$|Then by pouncing {{through the}} pricked cartoon, {{the design is}} {{transferred}} to <b>the</b> <b>plastered</b> surface. Broad spaces of background are now exposed by removing the finishing coat, thus revealing <b>the</b> colored <b>plaster</b> beneath, and following this {{the outlines of the}} rest of the design are scratched with an iron knife through the outer skimming to the underlying tinted surface.|$|R
5000|$|In 1914 Urbania created {{but never}} {{finished}} <b>the</b> gigantic <b>plaster</b> figures “Spring and Effort” (also called “Water and Electricity”) for the canceled Provincial House in Ljubljana (<b>the</b> <b>plasters</b> are currently disassembled in the National Gallery). His figure “Passages of the Danube” was commissioned for the Michaelerplatz, in Vienna, but was removed during WWII {{and is now}} missing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Laths are {{the thin}} split boards which are nailed upon {{the sides of}} a room before <b>the</b> <b>plastering</b> is put on. Sometimes laths are made very narrow, and are nailed on at a little {{distance}} from each other, so as to leave a crack between them. Then <b>the</b> <b>plastering,</b> being soft when it is put on, works into the cracks, and thus clings to the wood when it is dry and hard. If plastering was put on to smooth boards, or a smooth wall, it would all fall off again very easily." ...|$|R
5|$|It {{is one of}} the {{fourteen}} Black Paintings that Goya applied in oil on <b>the</b> <b>plaster</b> walls of his house, the Quinta del Sordo. The paintings were completed in secret: he did not title any of the works or leave record of his intentions in creating them. Absent of fact, Witches' Sabbath is generally seen by art historians as a satire on the credulity of the age, a condemnation of superstition and the witch trials of the Spanish Inquisition. As with the other works in the group, Witches' Sabbath reflects its painter's disillusionment and can be linked thematically to his earlier etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters as well as the Disasters of War print series, another bold political statement published only posthumously.|$|E
5|$|The {{removal of}} the sword from the coinage hub, which had already been {{produced}} by reduction from <b>the</b> <b>plaster</b> models, was accomplished by painstaking work by Mint Chief Engraver Morgan, using extremely fine engraving tools under magnification. Morgan did the work on December 23 {{in the presence of}} de Francisci, who had been summoned to the Philadelphia Mint to ensure the work met with his approval. It was insufficient merely to remove the sword, {{as the rest of the}} design had to be adjusted. Morgan had to hide the excision; he did so by extending the olive branch, previously half-hidden by the sword, but had to remove a small length of stem that showed to the left of the eagle's talons. Morgan also strengthened the rays, and sharpened the appearance of the eagle's leg. The chief engraver did his work with such skill that the work on the dollar was not known for over 85years.|$|E
5|$|The temple is a {{powerful}} symbol of Cambodia, and {{is a source of}} great national pride that has factored into Cambodia's diplomatic relations with France, the United States and its neighbour Thailand. A depiction of Angkor Wat {{has been a part of}} Cambodian national flags since the introduction of the first version circa 1863. From a larger historical and even transcultural perspective, however, the temple of Angkor Wat did not become a symbol of national pride sui generis but had been inscribed into a larger politico-cultural process of French-colonial heritage production in which the original temple site was presented in French colonial and universal exhibitions in Paris and Marseille between 1889 and 1937. Angkor Wat's aesthetics were also on display in <b>the</b> <b>plaster</b> cast museum of Louis Delaporte called musée Indo-chinois which existed in the Parisian Trocadero Palace from c.1880 to the mid-1920s.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Carlisle <b>Plaster</b> and Cement Company Limited {{closed the}} mine in 1914-5, but in 1922 the mine was reopened for the {{extraction}} of anhydrite by <b>the</b> Long Meg <b>Plaster</b> and Mineral Company Limited. The mine was purchased in 1939 by <b>the</b> British <b>Plaster</b> Board Limited, renamed British Gypsum, who closed the mine in January 1976.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Waste {{materials}} are utilized with an increasing frequency {{in the building}} industry, during the last decades. The motivation is both environmental and economical. In this paper, waste ceramic powder produced at the grinding of hollow brick blocks used in precise-walling technologies, is applied as a partial replacement of siliceous aggregates of lime <b>plasters.</b> <b>The</b> designed <b>plaster</b> mixes are analyzed {{from the point of}} view of their basic physical, mechanical, hygric and thermal properties. The bulk density, matrix density, open porosity, compressive strength, bending strength, water vapor diffusion permeability, water vapor diffusion coefficient, water vapor diffusion resistance factor, thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity are the investigated parameters. A reference lime plaster is analyzed as well, for the sake of comparison. Experimental results show a remarkable enhancement of mechanical properties of <b>the</b> <b>plasters</b> with <b>the</b> increasing dosage of ceramic powder. Moreover, the thermal insulation properties are improved and the water vapor diffusion capability of <b>the</b> <b>plasters</b> with ceramic powder increases...|$|R

5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the Wootton Hall is its pair of Italian black and Beschia marble blackamoor torchères, originally given to the First Duke of Marlborough as a present from General Charles Churchill. In exceptionally good condition, they stand {{either side of the}} door into the Saloon. These were discovered in the silt of the River Tiber and are depictions of slaves who once served in a Roman household. Several flags stand above them, including the White Ensign. The ceiling is intricately made, featuring flowers in <b>the</b> <b>plaster,</b> each one different, the work of Colen Campbell in the early 18th century. The black and white check marble floor is also a distinguishing {{feature of the}} room, but through most of its history this floor would have been left plain as horses and carriages would enter the hall inside. In the mid 19th century Frederick, the 4th Earl, had laid down brown and blue tiles, replaced by the marble floor which was added by his son Robert in around 1910. The floor gives significant depth to the hall and provides fine acoustics, so much that Diana would once practice her tap dancing in the hall as a teenager.|$|E
5|$|Swiatek and Breen {{described}} the Alabama half dollar as {{caught up in}} the presidential election of 1920, as a Republican administration might not be willing to put the Democrat Wilson on a coin, or might insist on the new incumbent appearing, something likely to dampen sales in Alabama, part of the Democratic Solid South. The Republican, Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, won the election and was inaugurated in March 1921. On June 29, 1921, Owen wrote to Baker, suggesting a new pair of honorees for the coin: Kilby, the state's chief executive {{at the time of the}} 1919 centennial, and the State of Alabama's first governor, William Bibb. Cartoonist Frank Spangler of the Montgomery Advertiser prepared sketches of the new design. At James Fraser's suggestion, <b>the</b> <b>plaster</b> models were created by his wife, Laura Gardin Fraser, who was a noted sculptor in her own right. She shipped her completed work to the Commission of Fine Arts on September 22, 1921, and gained members' approval; the models were then sent to the Philadelphia Mint for use in making coinage dies. Laura Fraser thus became the first woman to design a coin, not only of the U.S., but of any country.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{example of}} electrotyping's use for preservation is the electrotype of <b>the</b> <b>plaster</b> life-mask {{of the poet}} John Keats (see photograph E below). The original life mask was made by Haydon in 1816. <b>The</b> <b>plaster</b> mask was electrotyped in 1884 by Elkington & Co., and this copper copy is now apparently in better condition than <b>the</b> <b>plaster</b> original.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Earth mortars {{have been}} applied since unknown times. Their {{advantages}} are ecological but also cover several technical aspects, in terms of compatibility with masonries, reversibility, comfort, aesthetic and health. Some requirements of a recent German standard, which focus on non-stabilized earth plastering mortars, are presented. A commercial premixed Portuguese earth mortar was made within an ECVET workshop and applied as plasters on four different experimental masonry walls, at exterior environmental conditions. <b>The</b> <b>plasters</b> were observed during six months and characterized in situ by non destructive techniques, namely by ultra-sounds and for surface hardness. The same mortar used for <b>the</b> <b>plasters</b> was characterized in laboratory in fresh state and samples of mortar (only mortar and mortar layer applied on brick) were produced and characterized after drying. The characterization of <b>the</b> earth <b>plasters</b> applied on <b>the</b> walls and of the mortar samples is presented and discussed, showing the viability of their use as plaster for different masonry walls...|$|R
