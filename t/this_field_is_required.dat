50|$|Homeobox-containing genes play {{critical}} {{roles in}} regulating tissue-specific gene expression essential for tissue differentiation, {{as well as}} determining the temporal and spatial patterns of development (Shiojima et al., 1995). It has been demonstrated that a Drosophila homeobox-containing gene called 'tinman' is expressed in the developing dorsal vessel and in {{the equivalent of the}} vertebrate heart. Mutations in tinman result in loss of heart formation in the embryo, suggesting that tinman is essential for Drosophila heart formation. Furthermore, abundant expression of Csx, the presumptive mouse homolog of tinman, is observed only in the heart from the time of cardiac differentiation. CSX, the human homolog of murine Csx, has a homeodomain sequence identical to that of Csx and is expressed only in the heart, again suggesting that CSX {{plays an important role in}} human heart formation.In humans, proper NKX2-5 expression is essential for the development of atrial, ventricular, and conotruncal septation, atrioventricular (AV) valve formation, and maintenance of AV conduction. Mutations in expression are associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) and related ailments. Patients with NKX2-5 mutations commonly present AV conduction block and atrial septal defects (ASD). Recently, postnatal roles of cardiac transcription factors have been extensively investigated. Consistent with the direct transactivation of numerous cardiac genes reactivated in response to hypertrophic stimulation, cardiac transcription factors are profoundly involved in the generation of cardiac hypertrophy or in cardioprotection from cytotoxic stress in the adult heart. Nkx-2.5 transcription factor may help myocytes endure cytotoxic stress, however further exploration in <b>this</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> <b>required.</b>|$|E

However, our institution uses a patented methodology [19] for the extraction, isolation and maintenance of hESCs [12, 13]. The ability of stem cells to proliferate and to reconstruct the damaged parts offers excellent possibilities [20]. Previous studies have shown the potential of stem cells to migrate at the injury site and commence host repair and healing via the direct or indirect cell-signalling. In the course of brain injury, stem cells initiate neuroprotection and neural repair by inflammatory suppression, causing tissue reconstruction and avert cell damage. We have also reported the efficacy of hESCs in patients with MS [10].

30|$|The paper {{contributes}} to the growing embryonic of research on digital disruptive technologies, which {{are present in the}} broader “STS turn in criminology”. In doing so, it demonstrated how territorial space can no longer be conceptualised solely in terms of the physical built environment. Criminologists must consider the interdependencies between physical territory and digital ether to understand how it is that illicit markets now function. The conceptual toolkit of ANT is particularly useful in examining this relationship considering its stance on technological agency. Technology both shapes and is shaped by human action in ways that cannot always be predetermined. Simple technological fixes are not likely to resolve the vulnerabilities of the smart city considering this fact. Criminal entrepreneurs will continue to innovate in response to technological change. The paper strongly argues for greater use traditional ethnographic methodologies to bolster research in this field. Methodological innovations in online social research cannot replace conventional offline methods but can complement them.

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{increasing}} focus on patient-centred communicative approaches in medical consultations, but {{few studies have}} shown {{the extent to which}} patients' positive coping strategies and psychological assets are addressed by general practitioners (GPs) on a regular day at the office. This study measures the frequency of GPs' use of questions and comments addressing their patients' coping strategies or resources. Methods Twenty-four GPs were video-recorded in 145 consultations. The consultations were coded using {{a modified version of the}} Roter Interaction Analysis System. In this study, we also developed four additional coding categories based on cognitive therapy and solution-focused therapy: attribution, resources, coping, and solution-focused techniques. The reliability between coders was established, a factor analysis was applied to test the relationship between the communication categories, and a tentative validating exercise was performed by reversed coding. Results Cohen's kappa was 0. 52 between coders. Only 2 % of the utterances could be categorized as resource or coping oriented. Six GPs contributed 59 % of these utterances. The factor analysis identified two factors, one task oriented and one patient oriented. Conclusion The frequency of communication about coping and resources was very low.

40|$|Advances in optical technology, {{instrumentation}} and implants now enable {{arthroscopic surgery}} {{to be performed}} on all large joints and most small joints of the limbs. Arthroscopic techniques are usually a development of surgical procedures previously performed through a large open incision, although the critical element of each procedure (for example removal of a torn meniscus) usually remains unchanged. The smaller size of incisions and reduction in tissue damage associated with arthroscopic surgery can reduce morbidity and complications. Therapeutic arthroscopy now encompasses excision, reconstruction and replacement of damaged or abnormal tissue. Improvements in the accuracy of MRI, CT and high-definition ultrasonography have limited the use of diagnostic arthroscopy to rare indications, {{but in the past}} 10 years the rates of some arthroscopic surgeries have increased by over 7 -fold. Considerable variation in the type and utilization of arthroscopic procedures exists in practice, partly explained by the slow diffusion of new techniques and technology, but also by differences in clinician and patient beliefs and expectations.

A retrospective review of patients treated in our NHS teaching hospital, in Plymouth (UK), over a 2 year period identified 17 thrombolysed patients, of whom two had undergone subsequent decompressive hemicraniectomy. These were non-dominant hemisphere strokes in young patients, aged 51 and 57. Initial NIHSS scores were 16 and 17, and they received thrombolysis at 2 [*]hrs 42 [*]min and 5 [*]hrs 10 [*]min post onset of symptoms respectively. CT imaging demonstrated cerebral swelling with significant midline shift in both cases, and decompressive hemicraniectomy was undertaken at 29 [*]hrs 8 [*]min and 27 [*]hrs 30 [*]min post-thrombolysis.

" This syndrome, which is initially asymptomatic, is often misdiagnosed due {{to the presence of}} symptoms that characterize other disorders present in patients {{with advanced}} liver cirrhosis, such as exercise intolerance, fatigue, and dyspnea. Stress and other conditions such as liver transplantation and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) may unmask this syndrome. Liver transplantation in this group of patients results in a clinical improvement and can be a cure for the cardiomyopathy. However, post-transplant prognosis depends on the identification of cirrhotics with cardiomyopathy in the pre-transplant phase; an early diagnosis of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy in the pre-transplant phase may avoid an acute onset or worsening of cardiac failure after liver transplantation. Since a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction may mask the presence of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, the use of newer noninvasive diagnostic techniques (i. e. tissue Doppler, myocardial strain) is necessary to identify cirrhotics with this syndrome, in the pre-transplant phase.

Combined-modality protocols can be used in three forms: a) neoadjuvant induction chemotherapy before definitive surgery or radiotherapy; b) concomitant chemoradiotherapy; and c) sequential therapy consisting of induction chemotherapy and chemoradiation. The aim of this article was to study the role of these methods in treatment of locoregionally advanced head and neck cancers. Methods: An extensive search was performed on PubMed using five key phrases of head and neck, carcinoma, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, induction chemotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. The search results were limited to randomized trials and meta-analysis. Results: Despite an improvement in organ preservation, induction treatment has no impact on survival. Chemoradiation provides higher survival and increased rate of organ preservation compared to radiation alone. Ongoing phase III comparisons of sequential therapy with chemoradiotherapy may help identify the superior approach. Conclusion: Although further studies in <b>this</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> <b>required,</b> taxane-based sequential therapy can be currently used as a reasonable alternative to chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers.

In {{various types of}} cancer different intracellular signalling pathways are perturbed, thus the patients with pathologically {{the same type of}} cancer often have dissimilar genetic defects in their tumours and respond in a heterogeneous manner to anticancer treatment. That is why the objective of the hereby study was to assess the gene expression profiles in canine mammary carcinomas (in unsupervised manner) classified by pathologists as grade 1 (well differentiated), grade 2 (moderately differentiated) and grade 3 (poorly differentiated) and compare their molecular and pathological classifications. Results Our unsupervised analysis classified the examined tissues into three groups. The first one significantly differed from the others and consisted of four carcinomas of grade 3 and one carcinoma of grade 2. The second group consisted of four grade 1 car cinomas. The very heterogeneous (based on their pathological parameters) group was the last one which consisted of two grade 1 carcinomas, two grade 3 carcinomas and five grade 2 carcinomas. Hierarchical dendrogram showed that the most malignant tumour group had significantly distinct gene expression. Conclusions Molecular classification of canine mammary tumours is not identical with pathological classification. In our opinion molecular and pathological characterization of canine mammary malignancy can complement one another.

The use of mental health care services is still growing at a substantial rate. This review illustrates {{that there is a}} growing body of knowledge on specific determinants in the etiology of several mental disorders. There is, however, little known about the interrelationships between determinants in the causal chain leading to disorders. Personality traits, traumatic events in childhood, a low socio-economic status, extensive urbanization and rapid social changes in society are related to more than one mental disorder. Interventions influencing these generic determinants, or training to cope with them, will have the greatest potential health benefits. No definite conclusions can be drawn about the effects of interventions, influencing the determinants of mental disorders. Interventions, targeting several determinants at the same time are assumed to be the most promising. The effectiveness of secondary prevention of depression in the elderly and prevention of substance abuse through programs at school has proven sufficient for national implementation. Interventions targeted at family members of psychiatric patients has been seen to prevent the occurrence of distress and anxiety disorders.

Polaron migration is predicted to occur through intraoctahedral transfer and polaron rotational processes, which are associated with adiabatic barriers of about 0. 1 eV. However, the rather small energies associated with polaron formation and migration suggest that the hole becomes delocalized and bandlike at elevated temperatures. These results together with an endothermic oxidation reaction [A. Lindman, P. Erhart, and G. Wahnstrom, Phys. Rev. B 91, 245114 (2015) ] yield a picture that is consistent with experimental data for the hole conductivity. The results we present here provide new insight into hole transport in acceptor-doped BaZrO 3 and similar materials, which will be of value in the future development of sustainable technologies...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory animals (namely, mouse, rat, hamster, guinea pig, rabbit), chinchillas, {{birds and}} reptilian {{medicine}} {{is a relatively}} new specialty of veterinary medicine, being until recently in the "early" stages, therefore at least in the last decade, some studies on these types of animals appeared in the literature and cosecquently, therapy issues of various disease states in these animals. Besides the fact that laboratory animals and reptiles are used in biomedical research, we would say, already routinely not to neglect is the growing number of holders of such "pet animals". In search of appropriate dosages to theese species, scientists have tried to extrapolate doses from dogand cats, based on experimental studies and then published. Based on "accumulation" of therapists in the recent years, only few drugs have been approved yet (especially for rodents), most of them having still the status application beside instructions (off-label application). Already known increased susceptibility of mice and rabbits to the toxicity of antimicrobials is particularly important due to intestinal flora, dismicrobism due to the narrow spectrum antibiotics often leading to the increasing of gram-negative and gram positive anaerobic, organisms which will induce in these species toxicity and death. In conclusion, dosages presented are the result of some clinical studies that could be yet considered as "empirical" and "extrapolated from other species" and which are perfectible every day by the information accumulation following the administrations. In this respect an "up to date" self-improvement of vet specialists who have interests in <b>this</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> <b>required...</b>|$|E
40|$|Reconstructive arm/hand {{surgery for}} {{tetraplegia}} is performed to improve arm/hand function and therefore personal well-being {{for individuals who}} accept such elective surgeries. However, changes at an impairment level do not always translate into functional or quality of life changes. Therefore, multiple outcome tools should be used that incorporate sufficient responsiveness to detect changes in arm/hand function, activity and participation, {{and quality of life}} of the individuals involved. This narrative review aims to assist clinicians to choose the most appropriate tools to assess the need for reconstructive surgery and to evaluate its outcomes. Our specific objectives are (1) to describe aspects to consider when choosing a measure and (2) to describe the measures advised by an international therapist consensus group established in 2007. All advised measures are appraised in terms of the underlying construct, administration, and clinical relevance to arm/hand reconstructions. Essentially there are currently no criterion standard measures to evaluate the consequences of reconstructive arm/hand surgery. However, with judicious use of available measures it is possible to ensure the questions asked or tasks completed are relevant to the surgical reconstruction(s) undertaken. Further work in <b>this</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> <b>required.</b> This would be best met by immediate collaboration between 2 outcome's tool developers and by analysis of pre- and postoperative data already held in various international sites, which would allow further evaluation of the measures already in use, or components thereof.

40|$|Abstract Background Elderly {{patients}} with multimorbidity who are treated according to guidelines use {{a large number}} of drugs. This number of drugs increases the risk of adverse drug events (ADEs). Stopping medication may relieve these effects, and thereby improve the patient’s wellbeing. To facilitate management of polypharmacy expert-driven instruments have been developed, sofar with little effect on the patient’s quality of life. Recently, much {{attention has been paid to}} shared decision-making in general practice, mainly focusing on patient preferences. This study explores how experienced GPs feel about deprescribing medication in older {{patients with}} multimorbidity and to what extent they involve patients in these decisions. Methods Focusgroups of GPs were used to develop a conceptual framework for understanding and categorizing the GP’s view on the subject. Audiotapes were transcribed verbatim and studied by the first and second author. They selected independently relevant textfragments. In a next step they labeled these fragments and sorted them. From these labelled and sorted fragments central themes were extracted. Results GPs discern symptomatic medication and preventive medication; deprescribing the latter category is seen as more difficult by the GPs due to lack of benefit/risk information for these patients. Factors influencing GPs’deprescribing were beliefs concerning patients (patients have no problem with polypharmacy; patients may interpret a proposal to stop preventive medication as a sign of having been given up on; and confronting the patient with a discussion of life expectancy vs quality of life is ‘not done’), guidelines for treatment (GPs feel compelled to prescribe by the present guidelines) and organization of healthcare (collaboration with prescribing medical specialists and dispensing pharmacists. Conclusions The GPs’ beliefs concerning elderly patients are a barrier to explore patient preferences when reviewing preventive medication. GPs would welcome decision support when dealing with several guidelines for one patient. Explicit rules for collaborating with medical specialists in <b>this</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> <b>required.</b> Training in shared decision making could help GPs to elicit patient preferences. </p...|$|R
