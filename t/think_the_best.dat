500|$|In 1931, Yost told Grantland Rice that {{he still}} {{considered}} the 1925 team {{to be better than}} his [...] "Point-a-Minute" [...] from the early 1900s: [...] "I still <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> team I ever coached was the 1925 bunch. [...] They had everything. [...] Those early teams had speed and power. [...] But the game was simpler then. [...] That 1925 bunch, which included Friedman and Oosterbaan, could run an end, buck a line, throw passes, kick, block, tackle, think, and do about everything needed on a football field to gain ground and keep other people from gaining ground. [...] Don't forget about that 1925 team that our opponents had a hard time making first downs, much less winning the game." ...|$|E

I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> {{thing about it is}} that it's playoff time, and adrenaline helps the most." [...] In the 7-game ALCS against the Indians he hit three more home runs, had 14 hits (tying the LCS record jointly held by Hideki Matsui and Albert Pujols since 2004), and scored 10 runs (bettering Matsui's 2004 ALCS record) while batting [...]500 (another new ALCS record, bettering Bob Boone's [...]455 in 1986) with a [...]576 OBP and a [...]929 slugging percentage.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the band}} is of German origin, their music {{is based on the}} American style of death metal. Drummer Lille Gruber explained, [...] "Blues and rock music was {{developed}} in the U.S., that means it all goes back to this country. The roots are there and I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> musicians will always be there." [...] When asked about the difference in terms of sound and direction between Psalms of the Moribund and Prelude to the Tragedy, Gruber stated, [...] "We got our own style on Psalms to the Moribund where Prelude to the Tragedy had very obvious hints of the bands we idolized. Psalms of the Moribund splits in two extremes, it went more chunky, brutal, thick and deep, {{but at the same time}} that math-approach and the technicality went up a lot!" ...|$|E
500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{thought it}} [...] "was {{one of the}} best Fringes yet for the way it wove its sci-fi with its {{emotional}} subplots with such tight, artful braiding". Television Without Pity rated it an A, while The A.V. Club's Noel Murray gave the episode an A-, explaining [...] "This was, I <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Fringe of the season, and I’m only docking it a notch because it was less about themes and character than it was about plot. But man, what a plot". Various critics lauded Noble's performance. Website blogger io9 listed [...] "Grey Matters" [...] {{as one of the few}} [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show. In January 2013, IGN ranked the episode the sixth best of the entire series, explaining that the [...] "story is brilliant, with twists and turns and remarkable acting by both John Noble and Joshua Jackson as they portray a bond that's closer than anything else up to that point... This fantastic episode was an early Christmas present for Fringe fans." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{a repeat}} of the {{previous}} year's final on 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties after a 0–0 deadlock, resulting in Messi's third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. After the match, Messi, who had missed his penalty in the shootout, announced his retirement from international football. Sources reported that other Argentine players – Sergio Agüero, Javier Mascherano, Gonzalo Higuaín, Lucas Biglia, Éver Banega, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Ángel Di María – could follow their captain in retiring from international football. Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said after the match, [...] "My generation can't compare him to Maradona that's for my generation, because of what Maradona did for Argentine football. But I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> player ever played today here in the United States." [...] Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3); he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Sánchez.|$|E

500|$|The Blackest Beautiful was {{described}} as a post-hardcore record, much like its predecessors, from [...] "screaming rage to tight, sophisticated harmonies to frenzied funky riffing to emotively melodic parts". Mike Diver of Clash considered it a pop record with clear, melodic structure, while others grouped it with punk rock, soul, and funk, as well as displaying 'glimpses' of other music styles including Afrobeat, electronica and jazz. The incorporation of funk music has been noted by critics. Stephen Hill described the album as [...] "find the space between DC Hardcore and Stax funk". James McMahon described the album as being [...] "dragged through the civil rights movement, through 80s New York block parties, through the birth of hip-hop, funk, jazz and soul." [...] Terry Bezer in Front found that the album has 'as much in common with funk as punk' and wrote in Metal Hammer that the album features 'the musical dexterity and reckless abandon of razor-edged funk'. Letlive's ferocity and use of dynamics have led critics to draw comparisons to rock bands Glassjaw, At the Drive-in, Refused, Black Flag and Deftones. Bezer cited three albums as primary influences on The Blackest Beautiful: Raised Fist's Veil of Ignorance and its [...] "tempo changes, fury and non-stop fire"; Prince's Love Symbol Album and funk style; and Public Enemy's It Takes A Nation Of Millions for its confrontational and [...] "fight for what's right" [...] lyrics. Butler said that there was a poetic play in their combination of melody and chaos on the album: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> way for us as musicians to get people to listen is to appeal to them. Appeal to the natural rhythm of the head bob, the beating of the heart, the tap of the foot; just find that area and utilize it properly and say something." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{started in}} Oxford's {{first game of}} the 2007–08 season, a 1–0 home win against Forest Green Rovers, coming on at half-time. Eight days later, he scored his first goal of the {{campaign}} in the club's 2–1 away win at the Pirelli Stadium against Burton Albion, latching onto Eddie Odhiambo's cross to score from six yards. He started his first game in a 0–0 draw against Stevenage at Broadhall Way in late August 2007, and started once more in a game against Altrincham at Moss Lane a month later, scoring in injury-time to seal a 3–1 victory, having previously assisted the first goal. Odubade's third goal of the campaign came in Oxford's 2–1 home win against Salisbury City, scoring from just inside the area. He also scored a consolation goal for Oxford in the club's 3–1 away loss to relegation candidates Droylsden, as well as scoring twice in the following game as Oxford raced into a three-goal lead against Torquay United, although the game ended 3–3. Odubade scored again against Northwich Victoria in the FA Cup in November 2007, but failed to net again until January 2008 – scoring Oxford's goal in a 3–1 loss away to Salisbury City. After a 0–0 draw against Grays Athletic, a game in which Odubade was substituted on 64 minutes, he failed to start a game for three months. Subsequently, in March 2008, he was transfer-listed by manager Darren Patterson. Shortly after Odubade had been transfer-listed, it was announced that he had played his last game for the club, with Patterson saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> thing for him and us is that we go our separate ways". However, just a week later, Odubade was told by Patterson that he [...] "must start producing performances" [...] if he wants to be taken off the transfer list. He was taken off of the list after scoring three goals in four games {{at the end of the}} season, as well as starting in the club's last two games of the season. Patterson said that Odubade was removed from the transfer list because [...] "he's now putting in a shift" [...] every game. He finished the season as Oxford's top goalscorer, as Oxford finished the season in ninth place. In total, Odubade played 43 games in all competitions, scoring 11 times as Oxford finished in ninth place.|$|E
