5|$|Eidsvoll Verk {{was built}} {{along with the}} rest of the Gardermoen Line for the opening of Oslo Airport, Gardermoen in 1998. The station was {{designed}} by Arkitektskap, with construction starting in 1997. The station opened on 27 September 1998, but the commuter train service along the line did not start until 1999, when the Romerike Tunnel opened. In 2008, <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> expanded with an additional 36 parking spaces.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic Village {{for housing}} athletes {{during the games}} {{would have been a}} $1.1-billion series of newly {{constructed}} lakefront buildings that would have been converted to rental and condominium units after the games. The village was to be located immediately south of McCormick Place, which was expected to host 11 event venues, on a current truck parking lot between South Lake Shore Drive and the Illinois Central Railroad tracks in the Near South Side and Douglas community areas. At the time, <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> being used to stage events at McCormick Place. The village was slated to have pedways over Lake Shore Drive. This location was meant to enable 88% of the Olympic athletes to be within 15 minutes of their competition venue.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to heavy}} rainfall, {{widespread}} flooding was reported, {{especially in the}} central and western portions of the county. Whole neighborhoods in The Acreage, Loxahatchee, Royal Palm Beach, and Wellington were left stranded for up to several days. In some areas, flooding was considered the worst since Hurricane Irene in 1999. At the post office in Loxahatchee, <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> flooded, forcing the building to close for several days. A major washout was reported in West Palm Beach {{at the intersection of}} State Roads 80 and 882. Also in West Palm Beach, a road collapsed and fire rescue crews quickly closed the road. On State Road 704, a portion of it became inaccessible to low-clearance vehicles. A man died in West Palm Beach after driving through the storm and crashing into a concrete wall along Interstate 95. Several major and minor roads were also inundated by water in Wellington. Additionally, there was flooding at the intersections of Meadow Avenue and Greenview Shores Boulevard, and Indian Mound Road and South Shore Boulevard. Heavy rainfall left several leaking roofs at an apartment complex in Pahokee.|$|E

Boyd's five conflicting stories were known before the hearing, but no one had ever called him as a witness in a court proceeding where he testified under oath.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> {{managed by}} the Marine Parkway Authority (which {{constructed}} and operated the Marine Parkway Bridge) until 1940, then by Robert Moses' Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (which absorbed the Marine Parkway Authority) until 1968, and finally by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)'s Bridges and Tunnels division until 1974 when the park was relinquished to the National Park Service. Parking fees collected from Riis Park contributed {{to the construction of}} the bridge.|$|E
25|$|The Central Library of the Cranston Public Library system {{opened in}} April 1983. Since then, the Central Library {{has served as}} Cranston Public Library’s {{reference}} and administrative center. The building originally boasted 22,500 square feet on {{three and a half}} acres of land, with a capacity for 110,000 volumes. <b>The</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> expanded in 1992, and a 6,200 square foot addition was added in 1993/1994.

25|$|The Sanitary Market (Daniel Huntington, 1910; reconstructed 1942, McClelland and Jones; rehabilitated and {{extended}} 1981, Bassetti Norton Metler) reputedly was so {{named for its}} innovation at the time, that no horses were allowed inside. A fire on December 15, 1941, eight days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, severely damaged the building. Although the true cause of the fire was never determined, newspapers at the time speculated that the Japanese were to blame. The building was reconstructed as a 2-story building with rooftop parking. Nearly four decades later <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> eliminated, replaced by two floors of residences.|$|E
25|$|As {{many critics}} had {{anticipated}} during Federal Triangle's {{construction in the}} 1930s, parking issues grew much worse due to the development's existence. In the late 1950s, a proposal was made to build a commuter and long-distance bus terminal at Federal Triangle {{as well as a}} large office building on the space of the parking lot, but the $60 million it would take to build the terminal was never provided. The parking issue became so vexing that the Eisenhower administration ordered its own parking study in 1959. There were several attempts to remove the parking lot in the interior of Federal Triangle and build the long-planned Great Plaza. The first such move came in 1955, when the Commission of Fine Arts asked the federal government to build the plaza, but nothing came of the proposal. A second effort was made in 1972, with the goal of building the Great Plaza in time for the national bicentennial in 1976, but the required $36.7 million in federal funds were not forthcoming. <b>The</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> leased to a private company in 1979.|$|E
25|$|In May 1999, {{the mall}} began a $50 million {{renovation}} program, {{which included a}} new glass entrance at Flatbush Avenue, and upgrades to the mall interior. Around 2002, the mall's owners planned to construct an addition to the mall, on the parking lot {{on the east side}} of 55th Street. As originally planned, it would have added 100,000 square feet to the mall, with a home improvement store, a multiplex theater replacing the original mall theater, and indoor parking space. A new complex on the site had been planned going back to 1997. In mid-2003, <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> closed in preparation for the addition. In 2005, Lowe's signed on to occupy the home improvement store. The expansion faced community backlash due to fears of increased traffic in the area. The developers, Vornado Realty Trust (the successors to Alexander's), and the New York City Department of City Planning were also accused of conspiring to keep the local community in the dark about the progress of the addition. The community opposition led the developers to downsize the expansion to the single Lowe's store. Construction began in 2009, and the Lowe's was opened on July 23, 2010.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, the {{university}} tried {{to convert the}} west end of the park, which was already a no-cost parking lot, into a fee lot for students and faculty only. The west end of the park was (and remains) the location of the People's Stage, a permanent bandstand that had just been erected {{on the edge of the}} lawn within the no-cost parking lot. Completed in the spring of 1979, it had been designed and constructed through user-development and voluntary community participation. This effort was coordinated by the People's Park Council, a democratic group of park advocates, and the People's Park Project/Native Plant Forum. Park users and organizers believed that {{the university}}'s main purpose in attempting to convert <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> the destruction of the People's Stage in order to suppress free speech and music, both in the park and in the neighborhood south of campus as a whole. It was also widely believed that the foray into the west end warned of the dispossession of the entire park for the purpose of university construction. A spontaneous protest in the fall of 1979 led to an occupation of the west end that continued uninterrupted throughout December 1979. Park volunteers tore up the asphalt and heaped it up as barricades next to the sidewalks along Dwight Way and Haste Street. This confrontation led to negotiations between the university and the park activists. The park activists were led by the People's Park Council, which included park organizers and occupiers, as well as other community members. The university eventually capitulated. Meanwhile, the occupiers, organizers, and volunteer gardeners transformed the former parking lot into a newly cultivated organic community gardening area, which remains to this day.|$|E
500|$|The {{park and}} ride at the transit center {{initially}} consisted of the west lot, with 284 spaces, and was expanded twice in the 2000s. In 2001, <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> expanded to 950 spaces after the $7.6 million purchase of [...] from Simon Property Group. The completion of Thornton Creek in April 2009 brought 350 additional parking spaces {{to be added to}} the transit center, mostly used to replace a 500-stall {{park and ride}} north of the mall.|$|E
2500|$|In late October 2012, Hurricane Sandy {{struck the}} New York City area, {{particularly}} effecting the Rockaway Peninsula. At Riis Park, sand was pushed north {{from the beach}} onto the back beach areas. The bathhouse was flooded and damaged. However, structures like the Wise Clock and the new Jacob Riis bust were generally unscathed. During the recovery effort, the large parking lot {{was used as a}} temporary dump for debris from the park and the entire peninsula. This included excess sand, trees, cars, boats, and household debris. <b>The</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> selected as a waste facility due to its size, location on the peninsula, and connection to highways and roads. Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> used to clean sand before it returned to the beaches on the peninsula. Because of this the lot was filled with numerous man-made dunes. [...] The park reopened in May 2013. Repairs to the bathhouse occurred from 2015 to 2016, after which the NPS solicited requests for proposals to reuse the entry pavilion and bathhouse.|$|E

The topography of the beach was leveled, with numerous dunes eliminated. <b>The</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> partially opened in June 1936 with a 6,000-car capacity. On June 15, 1936, Green Bus Lines started the Q21B bus route, operating from Brooklyn and mainland Queens to Riis Park via Cross Bay Boulevard. The upgraded Jacob Riis Park was initially set to open along with Orchard Beach on June 19, 1937, but the openings were pushed back due to unfinished work. Both beaches were opened on June 25, 1937. Work on the parking lot and bathhouse were completed at this time.|$|E
