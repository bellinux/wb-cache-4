North and South Foyers provide <b>transitional</b> <b>space</b> from the Hall to the Dining Room and Living Room. Five secondary spaces are located off the Elliptical Hall: the Lobby, Den, Gold Room, Grand Stair Hall, and Lavatory. The second floor rooms, comprising Mrs. Vanderbilt's suite of Bedroom, Boudoir and Bathroom (designed by Ogden Codman), Mr. Vanderbilt's Bedroom and Bathroom, Guest Bedrooms and Baths and the Linen Room, are disposed around the Second Floor Hall and the North and South Foyers. The third floor contains five additional guest bedrooms, and a Servants' Hall separated from the guests' rooms by a door at the main staircase. Supported by both concrete and steel, the Vanderbilt mansion was considered modern for its time. The mansion also included plumbing and forced hot air central heating and electric lighting which was powered by a hydroelectric plant built on the estate on the Crumb Elbow stream. The Vanderbilt estate had electric lighting before the surrounding area.|$|E

40|$|<b>Transitional</b> <b>spaces</b> {{refer to}} those spaces located {{in-between}} {{interior and exterior}} environments acting as both buffer spaces and physical links, such as entrance canopies, foyers, lift lobbies, corridors, stairwells, etc. As <b>transitional</b> <b>spaces</b> may constitute {{a significant portion of}} the building volume and have large implications to occupants’ experience and building energy consumption, many research studies have come up in recent years to examine their conditions and characteristics. This research aims to investigate the thermal conditions and subjective thermal perceptions of occupants in the different types of <b>transitional</b> <b>spaces.</b> Semi-opened and fully enclosed lift lobbies and corridors in The University of Hong Kong (HKU) campus were chosen for the field study. Theoretical study, survey questionnaires and simple energy simulation have been implemented to examine the thermal comfort requirements, people’s perceptions and energy impact of <b>transitional</b> <b>spaces.</b> It was found that an opened area is easily influenced by variable weather conditions as it is close to natural environment while an enclosed one is totally separated from the exterior environment and commonly air-conditioned. This may lead to different subjective thermal responses in these two types of spaces. It was also discovered that people can accept wider thermal environment in <b>transitional</b> <b>spaces</b> and their thermal response varies with dressing, activity level, past thermal experience and prior thermal preference. It is believed that the current comfort standards and criteria are not designed for <b>transitional</b> <b>spaces.</b> The proposed thermal comfort ranges for <b>transitional</b> <b>spaces</b> were examined in this study using modified adaptive comfort model.

40|$|Maintaining comfort levels while {{reducing}} energy demand in {{buildings in the}} face of climate change is a key challenge in temperate zones. Creating <b>transitional</b> <b>spaces</b> and thermal variation in buildings may offer a way forward. This paper is a study of seasonal short-term thermal transitions in the lobby areas of three higher education buildings in Sheffield, UK involving 1, 749 participants, thermal comfort questionnaires and simultaneous climatic measurements. New patterns of thermal transitions were identified, which significantly modified seasonal subject’s thermal perception, and their reactions to temperature changes. Results suggest that it could be possible to positively alter people’s thermal perception in the short and long term through the judicious use of lobby spaces. This could help to reverse the negative effects of air conditioning in people’s thermal perception and aid energy saving. This work also provides a reflection on the purpose of <b>transitional</b> <b>spaces</b> in historical buildings and how the implementation of HVAC technologies has reduced the environmental diversity and the key role that <b>transitional</b> <b>spaces</b> play in providing thermal comfort in contemporary architectural design...|$|R
40|$|<b>Transitional</b> <b>spaces</b> {{are meant}} as “a space in between {{indoor and outdoor}} climate, or between two indoor environments, which thermal {{characteristics}} can be or not modified by mechanical control system and where occupant may experience the dynamic effect of this change”. Nowadays, <b>transitional</b> <b>spaces</b> are pivotal in non-residential architecture {{and the proportion of}} such areas may vary between 10 % up to 40 % of the total volume depending on the typology. Mixed-mode buildings are desings with by both active and passive systems. The necessity of buildings’ energy demand and consumption reduction is a tangible fact after the entry into force of the EPBD directive 31 / 2010 /EU. As a consequence buildings design went through the improvement of thermal envelope proprieties. In particular, for non-residential buildings this aspect combined with the increased level of internal gains has changed the energy balance: low heating demand compensated by an increased cooling demand not restricted to the only summer season. This evidence has stimulated a renewed interest in designers for the exploitation of natural ventilation as means of passive cooling solutions. <b>Transitional</b> <b>spaces</b> rely on a great potential for natural ventilation exploitation. They have direct connection with the outside, their architecture based on large volume suites with the principles for an effective natural ventilation. Because of the awareness of natural ventilation limitations, which relies on natural forces, the interest has progressively moved towards mixed-mode buildings. Mixed-mode buildings are indeed designed in such way that the HVAC system help to prevent uncomfortable conditions when natural ventilation is not sufficient to guarantee a comfortable environment. With the aim of a better overview about the role of <b>transitional</b> <b>spaces</b> in mixed-modeventilation design, technical information about 17 non-residential mixed-mode buildings among Europe have been recovered and analysed. All the information about <b>transitionals</b> <b>spaces</b> typology, mixed-mode scheme, ventilation strategy, controls and HVAC integration have been collected in a small database presented by an excel factsheet...|$|R

40|$|As it is known, {{the energy}} {{consumption}} of buildings is {{directly linked to}} their energy demand. Therefore, the most direct strategy to reduce the energy consumption of a building is to minimise its energy demand. This {{can be done in}} two ways. On the one hand, the energy demand can be reduced by minimising the size of some energy consuming spaces in the building. It can also be reduced by minimising the requirements of their comfort conditions. This second strategy is especially effective in <b>transitional</b> <b>spaces,</b> where the comfort requirements have wider limits than in normally occupied zones so energy savings are possible by allowing for a modest relaxation of the comfort standards. This paper reports on an analytical study into the energy-saving potential associated with modifications in thermal comfort limits in <b>transitional</b> <b>spaces</b> in commercial buildings. Such <b>transitional</b> <b>spaces</b> may not require the same high level and close control as more fully indoor or fully occupied areas, and thus a wider variation in conditions and interpretation of thermal comfort may be permitted. They also take up a significant fraction of the total volume of these kinds of buildings and give rise to significant energy use to provide comfort by means of heating or cooling systems. Initial trial calculations have been conducted using standardised commercial building layouts {{in order to determine the}} potential for energy savings. Commercial buildings have been chosen not only due to the extensive presence of this kind of building in almost all cities, but also because of the considerable percentage of <b>transitional</b> <b>spaces</b> that these buildings have in a standard floor plan. The relationship between these transition al spaces and the indoor areas will also be considered in this study.

40|$|The study {{emphasizes}} changing {{light conditions}} in architectural spaces {{as a major}} factor on human eye adaptation, which represents a potential case for a visual shock. This visual shock is experienced when occupants encounter a sudden field of light whose intensity is above or below the limit of human eye adaptable range. To examine this condition, a new methodology is developed and outlined. It identifies the visual shock within <b>transitional</b> <b>spaces</b> and allows architects to investigate strategies that influence visual comfort. The physiological field of vision analysis is used to first critique, then to adjust, and finally to interpret scenes within <b>transitional</b> <b>spaces.</b> The methodology begins by using a 180 ° angle fish-eye lens camera to capture 3 -D photographs along a selected pedestrian pathway. The photographs are overlaid by a “field of view” diagram to deduct areas obstructed by human facial features (eyebrows, cheeks, and nose). Area weighted percentages of the net view profile is then calculated using an overlay hemispherical radial grid. These percentages represent the cut-off vision (0 %), the one-eye vision (12. 5 %), the peripheral vision (25 %), and the central vision (50 %). Image metamorphosis {{is done by the}} aid of the Adobe Photoshop software to restrict the image to four monochromatic contrasts of shade. Parallel to photographs, actual light intensity readings are collected and calibrated to each assigned contrast on the images. To illustrate the methodology, a case of a person experiencing an extreme discomfort by walking {{in the direction of a}} blinding sunlight source has been chosen and investigated. 3 -D Computer modeling is then adopted to investigate the different architectural daylight solutions as suggested by the modified design and predicts a visual comfort.
