5|$|Lenin never {{witnessed}} <b>this</b> <b>violence</b> or {{participated in}} it first-hand, and publicly distanced himself from it. His published articles and speeches rarely called for executions, but he regularly did so in his coded telegrams and confidential notes. Many Bolsheviks expressed disapproval of the Cheka's mass executions and feared the organisation's apparent unaccountability. The Party tried to restrain its activities in February 1919, stripping it of its powers of tribunal and execution in those areas not under official martial law, but the Cheka continued as before in swathes of the country. By 1920, the Cheka had become the most powerful institution in Soviet Russia, exerting influence over all other state apparatus.|$|E
5|$|The {{new party}} {{was a direct}} {{challenge}} to Kenyatta'a rule, and soon after its creation the Kenyan Parliament amended the constitution {{to ensure that the}} defectors—who had originally been elected on the KANU ticket—could not automatically retain their seats and would have to stand for re-election. This resulted in the election of June 1966. The Luo increasingly rallied around the KPU, which experienced localized violence that hindered its ability to campaign, although Kenyatta's government officially disavowed <b>this</b> <b>violence.</b> Of the 29 defectors, only 9 were re-elected on the KPU ticket; Odinga was among them, having retained his Central Nyanza seat with a high majority. Odinga was replaced as Vice President by Joseph Murumbi, who in turn would be replaced by Moi.|$|E
5|$|From 1984 to 1991 the sindicatos {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} protests against the forced eradication of coca by occupying local government offices, setting up roadblocks, going on hunger strike, and organizing mass marches and demonstrations. Morales was personally involved in this direct activism and in 1984 was present at a roadblock where 3 campesinos were killed. In 1988, Morales was elected to the position of Executive Secretary of the Federation of the Tropics. In 1989 he spoke at a one-year commemoratory event of the Villa Tunari massacre in which 11 coca farmers had been killed by agents of the Rural Area Mobile Patrol Unit (Unidad Móvil Policial para Áreas Rurales – UMOPAR). The following day, UMOPAR agents beat Morales up, leaving him in the mountains to die, but he was rescued by other union members. To combat <b>this</b> <b>violence,</b> Morales concluded that an armed cocalero militia could launch a guerrilla war against the government, but he was soon persuaded on an electoral path to change instead. In 1992, he made various international trips to champion the cocalero cause, speaking at a conference in Cuba, and also traveling to Canada, during which he learned of his mother's death.|$|E

Milhouse enlists the bullies to beat up Jack, but Jack wins the fight. Principal Skinner sees <b>this</b> <b>violence</b> and declares that Milhouse will play Rick instead of Jack; Lisa is angered as she {{does not believe that}} he is a good actor. Marge tells Lisa {{that it is important to}} encourage people who are not skilled by telling them that they are, using the example of Homer. The production is a success, but at the end it is revealed that Jack was disguised as Milhouse; he and Lisa leave hand-in-hand.|$|E

25|$|When {{each of the}} West {{children}} {{reached the}} age of seven, they were assigned numerous daily chores to perform within their household; all were very seldom allowed to socialise outside the household perimeters unless either Fred or Rose were present, and all had to follow strict guidelines imposed by their parents, with severe punishment—almost always physical—being the penalty for not conforming to the household rules. Each lived in fear of being the recipients of violence from their parents, and although <b>this</b> <b>violence</b> was occasionally inflicted by Fred, the vast majority of <b>this</b> <b>violence</b> was inflicted by Rose for any real or imagined breach of conformity. Occasionally, the violence was irrational, indiscreet or even inflicted for Rose's simple gratification (although Rose would always take great care not to mark the children's faces or hands in these assaults). Both Heather, then her younger brother Stephen (b. 1973), are known to have run away from home, although both children returned to Cromwell Street after several weeks of alternately sleeping rough or staying with friends. Both were beaten when they returned home. Between 1972 and 1992, the West children were admitted to the Accident and Emergency department of local hospitals 31 times; the injuries were explained as accidents and never reported to social services.|$|E

25|$|The {{causes of}} <b>this</b> <b>violence</b> against Muslims are varied. The roots {{are thought to}} lie in India's history– resentment toward the Islamic {{domination}} of India during the Middle Ages, policies established by the country's British colonizers, and the violent partition of India into a Muslim-majority Pakistan and a secular India with a Muslim minority. Many scholars believe that incidents of anti-Muslim violence are politically motivated {{and a part of}} the electoral strategy of mainstream political parties who are associated with Hindu nationalism like the Bharatiya Janata Party. Other scholars believe that the violence is not widespread but that it is restricted to certain urban areas because of local socio-political conditions.|$|E

Incidents have included kidnappings and executions; including those of police and local political figures as local criminal organizations ally themselves with rival Sinaloa and Gulf cartels fighting for dominance in the region. Petatlán has been especially hard hit by the violence. Federal Highway 200 between Acapulco and Zihuatanejo remains militarized, with soldiers manning checkpoints along the stretch looking for guns and weapons. These checkpoints randomly search private and commercial vehicles, including tour busses.|$|E
25|$|The {{second half}} of the 18th century saw a rapid {{expansion}} of European settlers into East Tennessee.

Even as the Cherokee chief Hanging Maw was meeting with Governor William Blount to discuss bringing peace to the area, the chief's delegation was attacked by a band of settlers, killing several Cherokee headmen.|$|E

25|$|Despite O'Connell's {{peaceful}} methods, {{there was}} also a good deal of sporadic violence and rural unrest in the country {{in the first half of}} the 19th century. In Ulster, there were repeated outbreaks of sectarian violence, such as the riot at Dolly's Brae, between Catholics and the nascent Orange Order. Elsewhere, tensions between the rapidly growing rural population on one side and their landlords and the state on the other, gave rise to much agrarian violence and social unrest. Secret peasant societies such as the Whiteboys and the Ribbonmen used sabotage and violence to intimidate landlords into better treatment of their tenants. The most sustained outbreak of violence was the Tithe War of the 1830s, over the obligation of the mostly Catholic peasantry to pay tithes to the Protestant Church of Ireland. The Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) was set up to police rural areas in response to <b>this</b> <b>violence.</b>|$|E

Greek and Turkish Cypriots started to flee mixed population villages where they were a minority in search of safety. This was effectively the beginning of segregation of the two communities. On 7 June 1958 a bomb exploded {{at the entrance of}} the Turkish Embassy in Cyprus. Following the bombing Turkish Cypriots looted Greek Cypriot properties.
