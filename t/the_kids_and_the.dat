500|$|Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave [...] "Bob Fires the Kids" [...] a B+ rating, calling its premise and {{structure}} [...] "reminiscent of classic Simpsons style" [...] and writing that the episode [...] "is effective because it doesn't just divide <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> parents: it sets them against one another." [...] He added {{that while the}} main plot [...] "loses some momentum at the conclusion, [...] keeps from sinking thanks to {{a steady stream of}} great lines going throughout." [...] Kowan concluded his review by stating that he was [...] "perfectly happy to laugh throughout an episode as a fan, even though as a critic [...] might occasionally want just a little bit more." ...|$|E
500|$|Ross Bonaime of Paste wrote: [...] "As {{great as}} {{an episode of}} Bob's Burgers can be when <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> adults are given their own {{separate}} stories... there's something much more rewarding about a storyline that combines the two groups in an almost Simpson-ian manner." [...] He also praised the episode's guest voice actors, citing in particular Bill Hader's character Mickey as [...] "very odd, but so much fun"; Bonaime gave [...] "Bob Fires the Kids" [...] an overall grade of 8.3 out of 10. Jen Johnson, writing for Den of Geek, also cited Mickey as a highlight of the episode, stating: [...] "I would say that I hope {{this is the end}} of Mickey and the chaos he brings to the Belcher family, but [...] was just too much fun. I hope he comes back." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, {{the couple}} were faced with a {{campaign}} of intimidation, after David witnessed an assault on Adam Macy (Andrew Wincott). Ruth was [...] "unnerved" [...] when the silent phone calls began and she sent the children {{to stay with her}} mother. The intimidation ended after a barn at Brookfield was set alight and the arsonist was caught, following an anonymous tip off. In 2013, Ruth and David celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary and Finch hoped the couple would continue to make Brookfield a thriving business, while relaxing into semi-retirement. Finch commented, [...] "Any couple who after 25 years still love going out for meals together, having the occasional break away without <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> odd roll in a haystack are doing pretty well I reckon." [...] The following year, Ruth discovered that, at 45, she was expecting her fourth child. However, the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage.|$|E

500|$|After Lollapalooza, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a worldwide tour, which was supported by Moby. Tensions continued to increase and {{when asked if the}} band hated touring, Cornell said, [...] "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E
500|$|Hawley {{noted that}} many US {{television}} series are filmed in Vancouver, and it [...] "offers an amazing array of looks and feels and, obviously, a great crew base and everything." [...] Sets {{for the series}} were constructed in a former supermarket warehouse in Burnaby, including a [...] "23,000-square-foot set" [...] for the interior of Clockworks Mental Hospital. Wylie called this the most complicated set, and felt [...] "trying to make a hospital feel fun is a perfect challenge." [...] The most difficult set for Wylie to create was the ice room inhabited by Oliver Bird in the astral plane, which he had to create in seven days. Wylie initially looked to have the set built by [...] "those people who make giant sheets of ice for ice sculptures and stuff", before eventually building the set out of visqueen. However, this did not work, and was a [...] "gigantic disappointment". Wylie had the set rebuilt within a week, with the second version using acrylic molded to look like thick sheets of ice. Another notable set featured a giant volume knob which Haller turns to [...] "control {{the volume of the}} voices he hears in his head". This was compared to the effects of films like Honey, I Shrunk <b>the</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Incredible Shrinking Man, and described by Gonzales as [...] "classic Noah Hawley". The sequence was filmed at the end of production on the season, and added to the second episode. All of Wylie's sets were built with [...] "external lighting features" [...] that could be controlled from a board, allowing the cinematographers to be flexible with lighting [...] "given that the reality of a location can change drastically depending on our main character’s perceptions and actions." ...|$|E

So I supported No Child Left Behind. I still do. I know there are a lot in my party that don't like it, but I like testing in our schools. I think it allows us to get better schools, better teachers; allows us to let our kids have the kind of hope that they ought to have." [...] However, during a presidential primary debate in 2011 he said, [...] "education has to be held at the local and state level, not at the federal level. We need to get the federal government out of education." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} in April 2008 {{that all of the}} original cast (except Kaya Scodelario and Lisa Backwell) would be replaced for series 3. Elsley said: [...] "There are risks associated with dumping a cast, but we just did it. There was some disquiet at the channel, but then they told us just to go with it." [...] Speaking at Broadcast's television drama conference, he also confirmed the show would stick to its pattern of introducing college-age characters, moving them on in the next series, then letting them go. [...] "The first year is about getting to know <b>the</b> <b>kids,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second gives us the advantage of being able to explore their psyches a little more," [...] said Elsley. Brittain said that the new cast would be quite different from the original characters, although people may still spot some similarities. Open auditions for the second generation of cast members were held in Bristol, which attracted 1,500 16- to 18-year-olds, followed by a further two days of auditions in London.|$|E
