A decade ago Geoffrey D. Austrian's Herman Hollerith: Forgotten Giant of Information Processing [1] drew attention to the technology and its inventor, providing many details of its early evolution in response to government and then business needs. Recently this technology has received more attention [19, 3, 5]. These treatments have begun to explore the role of tabulating equipment in American business before World War II, as well as the role of the business market {{in the development of the}} tabulating equipment industry. This paper takes a single industry, life insurance, and looks at the role <b>tabulating</b> <b>machinery</b> and early computers have played in its business processes, as well as the role of the insurance industry in the evolution of tabulating technology. The insurance industry is a particularly interesting one for these purposes because of its information-intensive nature. In one of th...|$|E
