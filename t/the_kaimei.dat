40|$|A re-investigation on the pre-Tertiary System {{that lies}} within the Kamikawa Basin, central Hokkaido, {{was carried out}} from a radiolarian biostratigraphic point of view. As a result, Tosshozan Formation and the Toma Formation, which have been {{previously}} included in the Sorachi Group and regarded as Triassic and Permian-Triassic sequences respectively, are now seen to consist of olistostromes of the Early Cretaceous age (Berriasian ?-Valanginian in the former formation and Barremian to Aptian in the latter formation). The Toma Formation in particular includes many exotic blocks of various geological ages: middle Permian and late Triassic limestones, late Triassic chert, late Jurassic chert and limestones, siliceous shales or acidic tuffs of Early Cretaceous, and sandstones and greenstones. The matrix of this formation consists of pebbly shale which is strongly sheared. A similar oliststrome belt of early Cretaceous age extends from the western flank of the southern Hidaka Belt to Sakhalin and seems to represent a convergent zone along the Eurasian plate margin during the early Cretaceous time. Additionally, {{we have found that}} the Takasu and <b>the</b> <b>Kaimei</b> Formations in the studied region belong to the Middle Yezo Supergroup, while the Hidaka Supergroup is here represented by the Aibetsu Formation belonging to the late Cretaceous sequence. Consequently, we proposed a revision of stratigraphy of the Pippu-Toma regions...|$|E

5000|$|The manga {{focuses on}} <b>the</b> (mis)adventures of <b>Kaimei</b> High School's campus support club, the Sket Dance (Katakana: [...] "スケット・ダン"; Kanji: [...] "助人団"; Transliteration: [...] "Suketto Dan"; Translation: [...] "Helper's Club"; {{included}} English acronym: [...] "SKET (Support, Kindness, Encouragement, and Troubleshoot)"). Dedicated {{to the general}} improvement of campus life, the Sket Dance is devoted to solving any and all problems submitted by the staff or student body. However, due to its general lack of meaningful assignments and the unglamorous reputation of being just a 'group of handymen', the Sket Dance is treated with widespread contempt and it is composed of only three members.|$|R
