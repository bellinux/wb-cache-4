We conclude that in the medium-term, even in countries where material concerns strongly affect well-being, social trust is a powerful predictor <b>of</b> the <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> SWB. However, in the short run the relationship between social trust and SWB does not hold and GDP stands out as the only significant correlate of SWB...|$|R
