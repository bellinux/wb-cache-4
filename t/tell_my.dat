5|$|Unfortunately, as I <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> white friends, we {{as black}} people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E

I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E

This way, I can sing all of the hit songs, the songs that people want. But, it's a deeper meaning... these songs meant {{more than just the}} chorus that's catchy... it's my life." [...] Since the show was created last minute, there were many changes. Originally, the set list included, [...] "Ego", [...] "At Last", [...] "Listen", [...] "Ring the Alarm", and [...] "Upgrade U". These songs were later removed from the set list and a new one was added with additional instruments. The success of the show has led Wynn Resorts to ask Beyoncé to return as a residency act.|$|E

500|$|Writer Rob LaZebnik {{told the}} New York Post that the episode was {{inspired}} by his son Johnny, who came out as gay while at high school: [...] "I am a Midwestern guy, so I don’t tend to wear my emotions on my sleeve, but I thought, 'What better way to <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> son I love him than to write a cartoon about it?'". He added that he pitched the storyline three years earlier, and got approval for his script from his son. Smithers' coming out is low-key, as was Johnny's; he told the Post that as he was [...] "the gayest little kid", his parents were not surprised by his sexual orientation.

500|$|Expedition to the Barrier Peaks {{received}} favorable {{reviews and}} was ranked the 5th greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure {{of all time}} by Dungeon magazine in 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game. Judge Bill Slavicsek felt the adventure was a [...] "classic clash of genres". It was not something he felt should be done often, but it made a [...] "memorable diversion". Judge Mike Mearls described how he felt {{the first time he}} read Expedition to the Barrier Peaks. [...] "I had this terrible, terrible conflict within myself to immediately <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> friends about it at war with a maniacal, desperate drive to keep it hidden at all costs." [...] Judge Keith Baker was most impressed with the adventure's art. He liked that it came with a separate book of art; in particular the before and after illustrations of the carnivorous plant with a [...] "built-in bunny lure". This was later featured in a Wizards.com [...] "Ask Wizards" [...] segment. According to the Dungeon editors, the adventure's defining moment was its froghemoth creature, and its full page color illustration.|$|E
500|$|Breakaways {{critical}} acclaim also enabled Clarkson to also earn critical respect, {{particularly from the}} rock and indie music scene, who had looked down upon American Idol contestants. In his memoir, Davis recalled a meeting with Simon Fuller and Sony BMG President Charles Goldstuck, where Fuller acknowledged how the worldwide success of Breakaway had validated American Idol itself. The popularity of [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] among the rock community also resulted in various cover versions by rock acts, such as A Day to Remember, Ted Leo, and Tokyo Police Club. Clarkson herself recalled, [...] "It's ridiculous how well that song was received by hard rockers, by indie people. I was walking around {{with a friend of}} mine and this hard-rock guy {{came up to me and}} was like, 'I look stupid, but I <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> friends I love this song.' People at concerts are like, 'That's my guilty pleasure. I don't mean to be mean, but I didn't want to like the American Idol girl.' But they love that song, and it kind of won them over." ...|$|E

500|$|Cisneros {{breaks the}} {{boundary}} between what is a socially acceptable way for women to act and speak and what is not, using language and imagery that have a [...] "boisterous humor" [...] and [...] "extrovert energy" [...] and are even at times [...] "deliberately shocking". Not all readers appreciate this [...] "shocking" [...] quality of some of Cisneros’s work. Both female and male readers have criticized Cisneros for the ways she celebrates her sexuality, such as the suggestive photograph of herself on the My Wicked, Wicked Ways cover (3rd Woman Press, 1987). Cisneros says of this photo: [...] "The cover is of a woman appropriating her own sexuality. In some ways, that’s also why it’s wicked: the scene is trespassing that boundary by saying 'I defy you. I'm going to <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> own story.'" [...] Some readers [...] "failed to perceive the transgressive meaning of the gesture", thinking that she was merely being lewd for shock value, and questioned her legitimacy as a feminist. Cisneros’s initial response to this was dismay, but then she reports thinking [...] "Wait a second, where’s your sense of humor? And why can’t a feminist be sexy?" ...|$|E
500|$|In an interview, {{recording}} engineer Gordon [...] "Commissioner Gordon" [...] Williams recalled {{the recording of}} [...] "Lost Ones", stating: [...] "It was our first morning in Jamaica and I saw all of these kids gathered around Lauryn, screaming and dancing. Lauryn was {{in the living room}} next to the studio with about fifteen Marley grandchildren around her, the children of Ziggy, and Stephen, and Julian, and she starts singing this rap verse, and all the kids start repeating the last word of each line, chiming in very spontaneously because they were so into the song." [...] Columbia Records considered bringing in an outside producer for the album and had early talks with RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. However, Hill was adamant about writing, arranging, and producing the album herself: [...] "It would have been more difficult to articulate to other people. Hey, it's my album. Who can <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> story better than me?" [...] She recalled Ruffhouse Records executive Chris Swartz ensuring her artistic freedom while recording the album: [...] "I had total control of the album. Chris Swartz at Ruffhouse, my label, said, 'Listen, you've never done anything stupid thus far, so let me let you do your thing.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Ballo's father {{subsequently}} wrote a {{book about}} his daughter's suicide. He decided not to give interviews to the press about his ordeal until the book was published. He {{wanted to be able to}} tell the story and impact of his daughter's death, on his own terms. Titled, Kaja: 1988–2008, the book explores the sequence of events that led to his daughter's death, from her time studying French in Nice. Her early history of psychiatric treatment is discussed in the book. He recounts the difficulties in getting information about his daughter's death from government authorities. According to the author, there was a slow response in receiving help from the Foreign Ministry of Norway. In an interview with Politiken, he explained the motivation for writing the book: [...] "After the funeral I felt I had to do something relating to grief. This was my way to process the grief. The second issue was that I needed to transcribe the account to later <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> little daughter Oda." [...] He also said, [...] "I wanted to contribute to greater openness about suicide." [...] He acknowledged, [...] "Losing a child means that life is turned upside down. I believe that grief becomes heavier if you do not share it with anyone." [...] The book was written with input from other family members.|$|E

500|$|While experts found Bundy's precise {{diagnosis}} elusive, {{the majority}} of evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other psychoses, and toward antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). [...] Bundy displayed many personality traits typically found in ASPD patients (who are often identified as [...] "sociopaths" [...] or [...] "psychopaths"), such as outward charm and charisma with little true personality or genuine insight beneath the facade; the ability to distinguish right from wrong, but with minimal effect on behavior; and an absence of guilt or remorse. [...] "Guilt doesn't solve anything, really", Bundy said, in 1981. [...] "It hurts you ... I guess I am in the enviable position of not {{having to deal with}} guilt." [...] There was also evidence of narcissism, poor judgment, and manipulative behavior. [...] "Sociopaths", prosecutor George Dekle wrote, [...] "are egotistical manipulators who think they can con anybody." [...] "Sometimes he manipulates even me", admitted one psychiatrist. In the end, Lewis agreed with the majority: [...] "I always <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> graduate students that if they can find me a real, true psychopath, I'll buy them dinner", she told Nelson. [...] "I never thought they existed ... but I think Ted may have been one, a true psychopath, without any remorse or empathy at all." [...] Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) has been proposed as an alternative diagnosis in at least one subsequent retrospective analysis.|$|E
500|$|On tagging {{first base}} after Cabrera's relay, Galarraga began celebrating his accomplishment. His {{immediate}} reaction to Joyce's on-field ruling was a momentary pause {{followed by a}} wry smile at the umpire {{before returning to the}} mound. Galarraga told reporters after the game that the outing [...] "was my best game, so far", and said that Joyce [...] "probably feels more bad than me. Nobody's perfect. Everybody's human. I understand. I give the guy {{a lot of credit for}} saying, 'I need to talk to you.' You don't see an umpire tell you that after a game. I gave him a hug." [...] He also told reporters, [...] "I know that I pitched a perfect game, I believe I got it. I said before, I got a perfect game. I'm going to show my son. Maybe it's not in the book, but I'm going to <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> son, 'One time I got a perfect game.' I'll show him the CD," [...] further calling his effort [...] "the first 28-out perfect game". Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, nobody is going to feel worse than he does. I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it so bad for the kid. I don't think you're as mad at the umpire as mad the kid didn't get it—and he did deserve it." [...] Leyland also said that Joyce's call was part of the [...] "human element of the game".|$|E
