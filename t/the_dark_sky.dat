2500|$|Metropolis {{features}} {{a range of}} elaborate special effects and set designs, ranging from a huge gothic cathedral to a futuristic cityscape. In an interview, Fritz Lang reported that [...] "the film was born from my first sight of the skyscrapers in New York in October 1924". He had visited New York {{for the first time}} and remarked [...] "I looked into the streets – the glaring lights and the tall buildings – and there I conceived Metropolis." [...] Describing his first impressions of the city, Lang said that [...] "the buildings seemed to be a vertical sail, scintillating and very light, a luxurious backdrop, suspended in <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>sky</b> to dazzle, distract and hypnotize". He added [...] "The sight of Neuyork [...] alone should be enough to turn this beacon of beauty into the center of a film..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smart {{regarded}} {{being able}} to draw the human being as {{the single most important}} attainment of any artist. When asked why none of the people in his pictures are ever painted smiling, he said that he could not draw smiles well. Unlike many primarily landscape artists, he could paint both the human form and the human face, {{as can be seen in}} his self-portrait work. He regarded abstract painters as people who never learnt to draw. Smart mostly painted with oil, acrylic and watercolours, generally using the bold primary colours – yellow, blue and red – and dark greys for his skies. This created an unusual effect in his works as the foregrounds of his paintings are fully lit despite <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>sky.</b> His process of painting was a long and arduous one, resulting in barely a dozen finished canvases a year. [...] "I always do a lot of preliminary drawings, moving the forms, the shadows, the buildings the figures around the canvas till I get that perfect composition..." ...|$|E

Stars and the world were gone for him, he closed his eyes. No stars, no sky, no world. No, No! The thick darkness of blood alone.
