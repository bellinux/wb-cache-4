5|$|Obesity {{is mostly}} {{preventable}} {{through a combination}} of social changes and personal choices. Changes <b>to</b> <b>diet</b> and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be used, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or length of the intestines, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.|$|E

In Exp. 1, a total of 600 pigs (PIC C- 29 × 359, initially 14. 7 lb) were used in a 42 -d growth study. Diets contained increasing amounts of soybean hulls (0, 3, 6, 9, or 12 %) in either corn-soybean meal or corn-soybean meal-DDGS–based diets (15 and 30 % DDGS for Phases 1 and 2, respectively). Pigs were blocked by initial pen weight, gender, and room location, with 10 pigs per pen and 6 replications per treatment. Overall (d 0 to 42), soybean hulls × DDGS interactions (quadratic, P < 0. 05) were observed for F/G and caloric efficiency on an ME and NE basis. Increasing soybean hulls worsened F/G quadratically (P < 0. 03) when added <b>to</b> <b>diets</b> without DDGS but linearly (P < 0. 01) when added <b>to</b> <b>diets</b> with DDGS. Caloric efficiencies improved on an ME and NE basis (quadratic, P < 0. 04) with increasing soybean hulls in diets without DDGS but did not influence caloric efficiency when added <b>to</b> <b>diets</b> containing DDGS. Adding DDGS <b>to</b> the <b>diet</b> decreased (P < 0. 04) ADG and ADFI but tended to improve (P < 0. 06) F/G. Adding soybean hulls <b>to</b> <b>diets</b> containing DDGS further reduced (quadratic, P < 0. 05) ADG and tended to reduce (quadratic, P < 0. 08) ADFI, whereas adding soybean hulls <b>to</b> <b>diets</b> without DDGS {{had no effect on}} ADG or ADFI...|$|R

40|$|A 28 -d {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the influence of dietary glycerol on grow-finish pig performance. The experiment was conducted at a commercial swine research facility in southwest Minnesota. A total of 1, 093 pigs (initially 171. 3 lb, PIC) were blocked by weight and randomly allotted to 1 of 6 dietary treatments. Pigs were fed corn-soybean meal-based diets. The treatments were arranged in a 2 × 3 factorial with main effects of glycerol (0, 2. 5, or 5 %) and added fat (0 or 6 %). Overall (d 0 to 28), there was a fat × glycerol interaction (P < 0. 04) for ADFI. When 5 % glycerol was added <b>to</b> <b>diets</b> without added fat, ADFI decreased; however, ADFI did not change when glycerol was added <b>to</b> <b>diets</b> containing 6 % added fat. Pigs fed diets with added fat had improved (P < 0. 01) ADG and F/G compared with pigs fed diets with no added fat. Increasing glycerol decreased ADG (linear, P < 0. 02) and ADFI (linear, P < 0. 04) and tended (linear, P < 0. 08) to worsen F/G, a result of the negative effect of adding glycerol <b>to</b> <b>diets</b> without fat. In conclusion, 6 % added fat improved ADG and F/G, but the glycerol used in this study decreased ADG and ADFI when added <b>to</b> <b>diets</b> without added fat...|$|R

25|$|Familial hyperinsulinism, {{linked to}} {{mutations}} in GLUD1, {{is characterized by}} hypoglycemia that ranges from severe neonatal-onset, difficult-to-manage disease to childhood-onset disease with mild symptoms and difficult-to-diagnose hypoglycemia. Neonatal-onset disease manifests within hours to two days after birth. Childhood-onset disease manifests during the first months or years of life. In the newborn period, presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, including seizures, hypotonia, poor feeding, and apnea. In severe cases, serum glucose concentrations are typically extremely low and thus easily recognized, whereas in milder cases, variable and mild hypoglycemia may make the diagnosis more difficult. Even within the same family, disease manifestations can range from mild to severe. Individuals with autosomal recessive familial hyperinsulinism, caused by mutations in either ABCC8 or KCNJ11 (FHI-KATP), tend to be large for gestational age and usually present with severe refractory hypoglycemia in the first 48 hours of life; affected infants usually respond only partially <b>to</b> <b>diet</b> or medical management (i.e., diazoxide therapy) and thus may require pancreatic resection. Individuals with autosomal dominant FHI-KATP tend to be appropriate for gestational age at birth, to present at approximately age one year (range: 2 days - 30 years), and to respond <b>to</b> <b>diet</b> and diazoxide therapy. Exceptions to both of these generalities have been reported. FHI-GCK, caused by mutations in GCK, may be much milder than FHI-KATP; however, some persons have severe, diazoxide-unresponsive hypoglycemia. FHI-HADH, caused by mutations in HADH, tends to be relatively mild, although severe cases have been reported. Individuals with FHI-HNF4A, caused by mutations in HNF4A, are typically born large for gestational age and have mild features that respond to diazoxide treatment. FHI-UCP2, caused by mutations in UCP2, is a rare cause of diazoxide-responsive FH1. Hyperammonemia/hyperinsulinism (HA/HI) is associated with mild-to-moderate hyperammonemia and with relatively mild, late-onset hypoglycemia; most but not all affected individuals have mutations in GLUD1.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of evolution {{in most cases}} has been gene duplication in tissues unrelated to the venom, followed by expression of the new protein in the venom gland. This was followed by natural selection for adaptive traits following the birth-and-death model, where duplication is followed by functional diversification, resulting {{in the creation of}} structurally related proteins that have slightly different functions. The study of venom evolution has been a high priority for scientists in terms of scientific research. This is due to medical relevance of snake venom, in terms of making anti-venom and cancer research. The more that is known about the composition of venom and the ways it can potentially evolve is very beneficial. There are three main factors that affect venom evolution that have been closely studied: predators of the snake that are resistant to snake venom, prey that are in an evolutionary arms race with snakes, and the specific diets that affect intraspecific evolution of venom. Venoms continue to evolve as specific toxins are modified to target a specific prey, and it is found that toxins vary according <b>to</b> <b>diet</b> in some species.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of adding sources of saturated fat <b>to</b> <b>diets</b> with sorghum-based dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS). For Exp. 1, 112 barrows (initially 140 lb) were used in a 69 -d growth assay with 7 pigs per pen and 4 pens per treatment. Treatments were a corn-soybean meal-based control and diets having 40 % sorghum-based DDGS (U. S. En-ergy Partners, Russell, KS) without and with 5 % added tallow or palm oil. Feed and water were consumed on an ad libitum basis until pigs were slaughtered (average BW 283 lb) to allow collection of carcass data and jowl samples. Fatty acid composition of jowl samples was used to calculate iodine value (IV) as an indicator of carcass fat firmness. Overall (d 0 to 69), the corn-soybean control supported greater ADG and ADFI (P 0. 9) compared with the DDGS treatments. Adding 5 % beef tallow and palm oil <b>to</b> <b>diets</b> with DDGS improved overall F/G (P 0. 14). Changes in IV indicated softer fat in pigs fed DDGS (P 0. 14) compared with DDGS treatments. Adding fat sources <b>to</b> <b>diets</b> with DDGS tended to improve (P < 0. 06) overall F/G, and coconut oil improved F/G compared with stearic acid (P < 0. 001). Pigs fed the control diet had greater (P < 0. 05) HCW than pigs fed the DDGS treatments. Pigs fed the control diet had lower IV and greater firmness score than pigs fed diets with added DDGS (P < 0. 02). Adding fat sources <b>to</b> <b>diets</b> with DDGS improved these estimates of carcass firmness and tip to tip distance for suspended bellies (P < 0. 001); coconut oil had a much greater effect than stearic acid (P < 0. 001).
