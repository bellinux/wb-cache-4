These offensives were conducted largely in order to secure a better position during the ongoing <b>truce</b> <b>negotiations.</b> Chinese forces continued to mount concentrated attacks on the lines of the UN forces, including the 45th Infantry Division, but the division managed to hold most of its ground, remaining stationary until the end of the war in the summer of 1953.|$|E
5|$|Qasim {{responded to}} the arrest of the Jerusalemite notables by {{cancelling}} his truce with Muhammad Ali and rallying the rebels of Jabal Nablus. He asserted that the <b>truce</b> <b>negotiations</b> had been a ruse to hold off the rebels until the arrival of reinforcements from Egypt. The rebels' strategy in Jabal Nablus was to split their forces (30,000 fighters) into three divisions and fight Ibrahim Pasha's troops on three fronts: Ras al-Ayn, the approaches of the Galilee, and Nablus city. On 24 June Bedouin not directly affiliated to Qasim's irregulars attacked Ibrahim Pasha's camp in Palestine's coastal plain. Four days of battle then followed between the rebels and Ibrahim Pasha's men at Ras al-Ayn, until the fortress in that village was captured by the Egyptians on 28 June.|$|E

5|$|Faced with {{increasingly}} hostile posturing by Italy {{during the}} spring of 1940, the Force de Raid was dispatched, on 2 April to the Mediterranean. The squadron was quickly ordered to return to Brest several days later, in response to the German landings in Norway on 9 April. The Force de Raid was transferred subsequently to Mers-el Kebir on 24 April, arriving on 27 April. Reports of Axis vessels in the area on 9–10 May prompted Dunkerque and Strasbourg to sortie. Dunkerque remained in the Mediterranean when the Italians declared war on France and Britain on 10 June. Two days later, Dunkerque and Strasbourg sortied to intercept reported German and Italian ships that were incorrectly reported to be in the area. On 22 June, however, France surrendered to Germany following the Battle of France; during the <b>truce</b> <b>negotiations,</b> the French Navy proposed demilitarizing Dunkerque and several other warships in Toulon.|$|E
5|$|In September 1952, the {{negotiations}} at Panmunjom {{began to fall}} apart, primarily due to Sino-North Korean insistence that all prisoners of war be repatriated to their respective original countries, regardless of their personal preferences. As {{a significant number of}} Chinese and North Korean POWs had expressed their desire to defect permanently to South Korea or Taiwan, the demand was met with strong opposition from the United States and South Korea. Feeling that {{the negotiations}} would soon fail, military commanders on both sides authorized numerous tactical plans as means of applying pressure on their opponents. In late September, the High Command of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) authorized the tactical plans which led to the Battle of White Horse. On October 8, 1952, <b>truce</b> <b>negotiations</b> officially ceased. Clark gave his consent to Operation Showdown the same day.|$|E

More than a week later, {{by the time the}} U.S. and Soviet Union began negotiating a truce, Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory. The <b>truce</b> <b>negotiations</b> rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis; when Israel gained the upper hand, Egyptian President Sadat requested a joint U.S.-USSR peacekeeping mission, which the U.S. refused. When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily, Nixon ordered the U.S. military to DEFCON3, placing all U.S. military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war. This was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Brezhnev backed down as a result of Nixon's actions.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Boomer turned {{increasingly}} anti-human. She {{was charged}} with Hera's care, but Hera rejected her. During a <b>truce</b> <b>negotiation,</b> Boomer told Athena that her daughter was alive but sick on the Baseship. She invited Athena {{to come to the}} Baseship and rejoin her people, because the occupation showed that humans and Cylons were incompatible and that humans would never truly accept her. Later, desperate for her child, Athena convinced Helo to kill her so she could resurrect on the Baseship. Once there, she retrieved Hera with the help of Caprica Six who killed a hate-filled Boomer to prevent her from killing the child. She had tried to prevent Athena from taking Hera to the humans and declared that Cylons were never meant to have children. Caprica Six returned with Athena and was detained by Adama in Athena's old cell.|$|R

In 1838 he, now an {{important}} war chief, went with Amorous Man (Pahayoko) and [...] "Old Owl" [...] (Mupitsukupʉ), to Houston, where they met President Sam Houston and signed with him a treaty. He became a historically important figure when, angered by the Council House fight of 1840, he led a group of Comanches, mostly his own band plus allies from various other Comanche bands, in the Great Raid of 1840. Their goal was to get revenge on the Texans who had killed thirty members of a delegation of Comanche Chiefs when these had been under a flag of <b>truce</b> for <b>negotiations.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Iberian War, {{which had}} been {{provoked}} by the uprising of the Iberians against the Persians in 524/5, had been largely indecisive: the Persians swiftly crushed the revolt, but were unable to make any gains in Byzantine territory except for two forts, Scanda and Sarapanis, in Lazica. The Byzantines had recovered from some early reversals to inflict two major defeats on the Persians in 530 at Dara and Satala. In their aftermath, they gained the two border forts of Bolum and Pharangium in Persarmenia, but were in turn defeated at Callinicum in 531. Throughout these conflicts, periods of <b>truce</b> and <b>negotiations</b> were interspersed with campaigns, but these had led to no concrete results.|$|R

Edward III of England had concluded <b>truce</b> <b>negotiations</b> with the Scots lasting from 25 March until Michaelmas, following the Burnt Candlemas of 2 February. During the truce, Earl William had secured safe passage to travel to Château Gaillard to visit David II; amongst his entourage was the 28-year-old Archibald.

While Owain ap Cadwgan of Ceredigion sought refuge in Gwynedd's mountains, Maredudd ap Bleddyn of Powys made peace with the English king as the Norman army advanced. There were no battles or skirmishes fought {{in the face of}} the vast host brought into Wales; rather, Owain and Gruffudd entered into <b>truce</b> <b>negotiations.</b> Owain ap Cadwgan regained royal favor relatively easily.

50|$|During the Civil War, {{the future}} {{location}} of Cullman {{was the site}} of the minor Battle of Day's Gap. On April 30, 1863, Union forces under the command of Colonel Abel Streight won a victory over forces under Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest. This battle was part of a campaign and chase known collectively as Streight's Raid. Although Streight got the upper hand in this battle, Forrest would have the last laugh. In one of the more humorous moments of the war, Streight sought a <b>truce</b> and <b>negotiations</b> with Forrest in present-day Cherokee County near present-day Gaylesville. Although Streight's force was larger than Forrest's, while the two were negotiating, Forrest had his troops march repeatedly in a circuitous route past the site of the talks.

25|$|In 1835, the U.S. Army {{arrived to}} enforce the treaty. The Seminole leader Osceola led the vastly outnumbered {{resistance}} during the Second Seminole War. Drawing on {{a population of about}} 4,000 Seminole and 800 allied Black Seminoles, he mustered at most 1,400 warriors (Andrew Jackson estimated they had only 900). They countered combined U.S. Army and militia forces that ranged from 6,000 troops at the outset to 9,000 at the peak of deployment in 1837. To survive, the Seminole allies employed guerrilla tactics with devastating effect against U.S. forces, as they knew how to move within the Everglades and use this area for their protection. Osceola was arrested (in a breach of honor) when he came under a flag of <b>truce</b> to <b>negotiations</b> with the US in 1837. He died in jail less than a year later.

25|$|During the Panmunjeom <b>Truce</b> <b>negotiations,</b> {{the chief}} {{stumbling}} block to {{the arrangement of}} a final armistice {{during the winter of}} 1951–1952 revolved around the exchange of prisoners. At first glance, there appeared to be nothing to argue about, since the Geneva Conventions of 1949, by which both sides had pledged to abide, called for the immediate and complete exchange of all prisoners upon the conclusion of hostilities. This seemingly straightforward principle, however, disturbed many Americans. To begin with, UN prisoner-of-war camps held over 40,000 South Koreans, many of whom had been impressed into Communist service and who had no desire to be sent north upon the conclusion of the war. Moreover, a considerable number of North Korean and Chinese prisoners had also expressed a desire not to return to their homelands. This was particularly true of the Chinese POWs, some of whom were anti-Communists whom the Communists had forcibly inducted during the Chinese Civil War into the PLA unit that was later transferred into Korea.|$|E
25|$|From {{the fall}} of 1246 through to the spring of 1247 no royal army {{attempted}} the hazards of Henry III’s last campaign, but a Marcher vanguard led by Nicholas of Meules, seneschal of Cardigan and Carmarthen castles, pressed into Gwynedd. The two brothers fortified themselves in the Snowdonia mountains, but were compelled into <b>truce</b> <b>negotiations</b> in the late fall and early spring of 1247. With the Peace of Woodstock, 30 April 1247, the two brothers rendered homage to Henry III and were recognised as the rightful rulers of upper Gwynedd {{in exchange for the}} services of twenty-four knights and one hundred foot soldiers, but had to abandon all claims to lower Gwynedd; namely the four cantrefs of Rhos, Rhufoniog, Tegeingl, and Dyffryn Clwyd; and also to Mold.

Operation Commando was scheduled for 3–5 October 1951 and the US I Corps commander, Lieutenant General John W.

Eventually, the completion of the 'Great Ditch' as an effective defensive blockade which slowed the advance of Liao cavalry forced the Liao to request a <b>truce.</b> <b>Negotiations</b> resulted in the Treaty of Shanyuan, signed in January 1005 (some sources cite 1004 due to the Chinese Lunar Calendar), which fixed the borders of the Song and Liao as they were before the conflict. The Khitan rulers also wanted to intermarry with the Zhao family line of the Song, an offer that the Song refused in favor of a nominal and figurative imperial kinship. However, the treaty required the Song to make annual tribute payments to the Liao and recognize Liao equality with the Song. The tribute consisted of 283kg (100,000 oz) of silver along with 200,000 bolts of silk, [...] increasing to 500,000 units by 1042. However, even with the increase in 1042, the Song economy was not damaged by this enforced tribute. The bullion holding of the Liao dynasty did not increase with the tribute either, since the Song exported many goods annually to the Liao, dwarfing the amount of imported goods from Liao. Therefore, much of the silver sent to Liao as tribute was used to pay for Song Chinese goods, and the silver wound up back into the hands of Chinese merchants and the Song government.|$|E

The Pegu navy held complete control of the Irrawaddy (as far north as Tagaung) but the blockades were not enough to force a surrender. Pegu's attempt to storm the ancient capital of Pagan failed. Minkhaung bought time by asking the monks to broker a truce. Protracted <b>truce</b> <b>negotiations</b> went on from April to [...] June/July of 1402 but the start of rainy season forced Razadarit's hand, and the Hanthawaddy fleet retreated from Ava. Minkhaung's vassals now rallied around him. He was able to assemble a sizable force, which he sent after the rainy season to relieve Prome. The Ava army decisively defeated the invaders south of Prome on 26 December 1402, forcing Pegu to ask for terms about ten days after the battle.|$|E
