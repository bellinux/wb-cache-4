They lay down a permit to use just organic seeds for establishment of organic crop stands. Such seeds have to originate from the plants being grown in compliance with organic farming rules for at least one generation. Organic farmers are obliged, in compliance with the above-mentioned legislation, to use seeds originating from {{organic production}} when establishing crop stands. Otherwise, they are allowed to use their own seeds or they may apply for an exception to a relevant public authority in order to use conventional unstained seeds. There are 3, 517 organic farmers in the Czech Republic and they run their <b>farms</b> on the <b>total</b> <b>surface</b> of 448, 202 ha, which represent 10. 55 % of the <b>total</b> <b>farming</b> land <b>surface</b> in the Czech Republic. Arable land represents 12. 26 % (54, 937 ha) of the total organic land surface. Cereals were considered as the main market crops and grown on the surface of 22, 762 ha in 2009. Deficiency of certified good-quality organic seeds in the Czech Republic is one of the factors limiting the organic cereals growing there. Crop stands are currently established from certified organic seeds (6 %), conventional unstained seeds (37 %) and farm seeds (57 %) in the Czech Republic. They are usually established from "uncontrolled" farm seeds originating from repeated reseeding. As restrictions on conventional unstained seeds are being imposed, seed growers have to be motivated to provide a sufficient supply of certified organic seeds. Current deficiency of approved seeds is also caused by a complexity of the reproduction process and small amount of approved seeds originating from the approved reproduction processes. Identical requirements for conventional and organic seeds have been imposed but organic farming is not so highly supported as conventional farming.

The Data was collected from 100 dairy farms, randomly selected from different localities within the Khartoum state. Information pertinent to dairy management, husbandry practices and preventive measure practices were secured through an extensive questionnaire and direct interview with the farm owners. A descriptive statistical {{analysis of the data}} indicated the following: - The total number of cattle in the 100 herds surveyed was 9145 heads with an overall mean of 91. 45 ± 107. 43 head / herd. The breed used in these farms was 1 oo % graded dairy cows of varying levels of exotic blood. The exact crossing percentage however was not identified because of lack of breeding records in the majority of the farms The Herd structure was as follow: the number of milking cows was 3462 cow (37. 86 % of the total herd) with an overall mean of 34. 62 ± 46. 38 cows / herd. The dry cows comprised 7. 14 %, Heifers 11. 85 % and calves and bulls accounted for 33. 15 % of the herd. The average daily milk production per cow was found to be 18. 95 ± 5. 99 lbs. The average price of lb milk was 54. 7 ± 7. 5 SD. The average lactation length was 269. 85 ± 18. 97 days, while the average dry period was 42. 84 ± 28. 56 days. The total amount of green fodder offered to a cow / day was 11. 0 ± 4. 4 kg DM and the supplementary feeding offered per cow per day was 5. 23 ± 1. 54 kg DM for the milking herds. Only 35 % of the farmers owned cultivable lands for growing their own roughages. Most of the pens were poorly designed; with an average area 9 of 1484. 66 ± 1962. 68 m 2. 20 % of which is shaded and 80 % unshaded area.

The objective {{of the current study}} was to develop a model of nitrogen management on the dairy farm, and to perform sensitivity analyses {{in order to determine the}} relative importance of manipulating herd nutrition, manure management and crop selection in reducing nitrogen (N) losses from the farm. The importance of the method of N input to the farm (purchased feed, legume fixation, inorganic fertilizer, imported manure) was investigated, and the potential to reduce N losses from dairy farms was evaluated. Nitrogen balance equations were derived, and related efficiency coefficients were set to reference values representing common management practices. <b>Total</b> <b>farm</b> N efficiency (animal product N per N input), and N losses per product N were determined for different situations by solving the set of simultaneous equations. Improvements in animal diet and management that increase the conversion of feed N to animal product by 50 % would increase <b>total</b> <b>farm</b> N efficiency by 48 % and reduce N losses per product by 36 to 40 %. In contrast, reducing losses from manure collection, storage and application to improve the percentage of manure N that becomes available in soil by 100 % would only improve <b>total</b> <b>farm</b> N efficiency by 13 % and reduce total N losses by 14 %. Selecting crops and management that can use soil nutrients 50 % more efficiently would improve <b>total</b> <b>farm</b> efficiency by up to 59 % and reduce N losses by up to 41 % depending on the predominant nitrogen sources to the farm. Legume production would reduce N losses per product compared with non-legumes.
