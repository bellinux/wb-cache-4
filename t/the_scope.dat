5|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of {{review of the}} {{discretion}} conferred by sections 8 and 10 of the ISA {{is limited to the}} traditional administrative law grounds of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety as established in the House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1984), also known as the GCHQ case. The Court noted that <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of judicial review depends on whether a jurisdictional or precedent fact is involved. Where no jurisdictional fact is involved, <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of review is limited to the GCHQ grounds. Where a jurisdictional fact issue arises, <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of review extends to deciding whether the precedent fact has been established. Whether a particular discretionary power is subject to any jurisdictional fact depends on the construction of the legislation which creates that power.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Chng Suan Tze v.

In contrast to the subjective test, the objective test permits the court to examine whether the decision-maker's satisfaction was based on objective facts which fell within <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of the purposes specified by the ISA. The subjective satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the executive body is insufficient. However, the adoption of this objective test {{was only part of}} the obiter dicta of the case.

2500|$|The {{effects of}} <b>the</b> <b>Scopes</b> Trial on high school biology texts {{has not been}} {{unanimously}} agreed by scholars. Of {{the most widely used}} textbooks after the trial, only one included the word [...] "evolution" [...] in its index; the relevant page includes biblical quotations. Some scholars have accepted that this was the result of <b>the</b> <b>Scopes</b> Trial, citing examples such as Hunter, the author of the biology text which Scopes was on trial for teaching, reforming the text by 1926 in response to <b>the</b> <b>Scopes</b> Trial Controversy. George Gaylord Simpson, though, challenged this notion as confusing cause and effect, and instead posited that the trend of anti-evolution movements and laws that provoked <b>the</b> <b>Scopes</b> Trial were also to blame for the removal of evolution from biological texts, and that <b>the</b> <b>Scopes</b> Trial itself did not affect this trend one way or the other. The fundamentalists' target slowly veered off evolution in the mid-1930s. Miller and Grabiner suggest that as the anti-evolutionist movement died out, biology textbooks began to include the previously removed evolutionary theory. This also corresponds to the emerging demand that science textbooks be written by scientists rather than educators or education specialists.|$|R
