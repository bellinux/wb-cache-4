40|$|The Master`s Thesis {{deals with}} design and {{construction}} of a valve block for a hydrostatic recuperative module of a vehicle with a direct application on pneu <b>tyred</b> <b>roller</b> AP 240 H produced by the AMMANN company. The thesis aims to analyze recovery functions of the valve block in several operating modes of the roller, followed by a selection of the right hydraulic components {{from the perspective of}} predefined parameters and pressure differences. Design specifications are based on measurements and mathematical simulations on the experimental stand. The experimental stand for this application has been developed at 1 : 4 scale as compared to a real vehicle. The thesis includes also design of the supporting console for the module on the frame of the vehicle. The Master`s Thesis is a part of project EUREKA with cooperation Bosch Rexroth...|$|E

50|$|On some machines, {{the drums}} may {{be filled with}} water on site to achieve the desired weight. When empty, the lighter machine is easier and cheaper to {{transport}} between work sites. On pneumatic <b>tyre</b> <b>rollers</b> the body may be ballasted with water or sand, or for extra compaction wet sand is used. Modern <b>tyre</b> <b>rollers</b> may be filled with steel ballast, which gives a more even balance for better compaction.|$|R
50|$|Road rollers use {{the weight}} of the vehicle to {{compress}} the surface being rolled (static) or use mechanical advantage (vibrating). Initial compaction of the substrate on a road project is done using a padfoot drum roller, which achieves higher compaction density due to the pads having less surface area. On large freeways a four wheel compactor with padfoot drum and a blade, such as a Caterpillar 815/825 series machine, would be used due to its high weight, speed and the powerful pushing force to spread bulk material. On regional roads a smaller single padfoot drum machine may be used. The next machine is usually a single smooth drum compactor that compacts the high spots down until the soil is smooth, and this is usually done in combination with a motor grader to get a level surface. Sometimes at this stage a pneumatic <b>tyre</b> <b>roller</b> would be used. These rollers feature two rows (front and back) of pneumatic tyres that overlap, and the flexibility of the tyres provides a kneading action that seals the surface and with some vertical movement of the wheels, enables the roller to operate effectively on uneven ground. Once the soil base is flat the pad drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface. The next course (road base) would be compacted using a smooth single drum, smooth tandem <b>roller</b> or pneumatic <b>tyre</b> <b>roller</b> in combination with a grader, and a water truck to achieve the desired flat surface with the right moisture content for optimum compaction. Once the road base is compacted, the smooth single drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface (There is however an exception, if the single drum has special flat-wide-base tyres on the machine). The final wear course of asphalt concrete (a.k.a. asphalt or blacktop in North America, or macadam in England) is laid using a paver and compacted using a tandem smooth drum roller, a three-point roller or a pneumatic <b>tyre</b> <b>roller.</b> Three point rollers on asphalt were very common once and are still used, but tandem vibrating rollers are the usual choice now, with the pneumatic <b>tyre</b> <b>roller's</b> kneading action being the last roller to seal off the surface.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} compactors and lift thickness on {{hot mix asphalt}} (HMA) have been persistently discussed among asphalt experts. In many cases, pavements paved with the high-in-place air voids permit water to penetrate the permeable pavement causing an increased tendency for pavement deformation. The thin lifts have had problems achieving high density, which leads to high-in-place air voids. The present paper is aimed at evaluating the effects of different compactors, an 11 -ton steel drum compactor and a 15 -ton pneumatic <b>tyre</b> <b>roller,</b> on the HMA mat with different ratios of thickness to nominal maximum aggregate size (t/NMAS). In order to achieve this aim, seven field sections with a total 36 locations with distinct HMA mixes, thicknesses and rolling patterns were built. Each of the sections was approximately 40 m long and 3. 5 m wide. The section was constructed with t/NMAS ratio varying from 2. 0 at the beginning to 5. 0 {{at the end of}} the section. The air temperature during construction varied from 26 °C to 35 °C. More so, for comparison purposes, the simulated HMA mat temperatures using MultiCool 3. 0 software and their respective measured temperature were also taken. The results indicate that the optimum number of passes to achieve maximum density is four passes. This could be achieved by merely using the steel roller with vibratory mode. However, the introduction of rubber <b>tyre</b> <b>roller</b> during the intermediate rolling initially reduced the density by one to two percent but started to increase after several passes...|$|R
40|$|Proof rolling of {{granular}} layers in aircraft pavements is {{an integral}} part of the pavement thickness design methods used in Australia. The Department of Defence has a fleet of special purpose pneumatic <b>tyred</b> <b>rollers</b> with the capability to operate at up to 50 t on four wheels with tyre pressures of 1, 400 kPa. In 2004 the tyre manufacturers reduced the maximum allowable tyre pressures to 1, 000 kPa, creating a gap between aircraft load and the capacity of the proof rollers. To allow flexible aircraft pavements to continue to be constructed, one roller was upgraded to include solid urethane tyres with an effective contract pressure of 1, 700 kPa and higher. Whilst this roller has undergone a preliminary trial that was found to be successful, further trials are required prior to upgrading the remaining roller fleet...|$|R
2500|$|Invented in 1897, {{the duck}} brake or duck roller brake used a rod {{operated}} by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin friction rollers (usually made of wood or rubber) against the front tyre. [...] Mounted on axles secured by friction washers and set {{at an angle to}} conform to the shape of the <b>tyre,</b> the <b>rollers</b> were forced against their friction washers upon contacting the tyre, thus braking the front wheel. [...] A tension spring held the rollers away from the tyre except when braking. [...] Braking power was enhanced by an extra-long brake lever mounted in parallel with and behind the handlebar, which provided additional leverage when braking (two hands could be used to pull the lever if necessary). [...] Used in combination with a rear coaster brake, a cyclist of the day could stop much more quickly and with better modulation of braking effort than was possible using only a spoon brake or rear coaster brake. [...] Known colloquially as the duck brake, the design was used by many notable riders of the day, and was widely exported to England, Australia, and other countries. [...] In 1902, Louis H. Bill was granted a patent for an improved version of the Duck Roller Brake (Patent 708,114) for use on motorized bicycles (motorcycles).|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} successful rotary kilns {{were developed}} in Pennsylvania around 1890, based on a design by Frederick Ransome, and were about 1.5 m in diameter and 15 m in length. Such a kiln made about 20 tonnes of clinker per day. The fuel, initially, was oil, which was readily available in Pennsylvania at the time. It was particularly easy {{to get a good}} flame with this fuel. Within the next 10 years, the technique of firing by blowing in pulverized coal was developed, allowing the use of the cheapest available fuel. By 1905, the largest kilns were 2.7 x 60 m in size, and made 190 tonnes per day. At that date, after only 15 years of development, rotary kilns accounted for half of world production. Since then, the capacity of kilns has increased steadily, and the largest kilns today produce around 10,000 tonnes per day. In contrast to static kilns, the material passes through quickly: it takes from 3 hours (in some old wet process kilns) to as little as 10 minutes (in short precalciner kilns). Rotary kilns run 24 hours a day, and are typically stopped only for a few days {{once or twice a year}} for essential maintenance. One of the main maintenance works on rotary kilns is <b>tyre</b> and <b>roller</b> surface machining and grinding works which can be done while the kiln works in full operation at speeds up to 3.5 rpm. This is an important discipline, because heating up and cooling down are long, wasteful and damaging processes. Uninterrupted runs as long as 18 months have been achieved.|$|R
40|$|The {{observation}} of apparent structural distress {{in the form}} of well-formed diagonal cracks in a number of kiln supporting piers in a cement manufacturing plant led to a detailed investigation to diagnose the problem facing the piers and to propose remedial measures to enhance the safety of the piers. The strength assessment of the as-built piers included necessary field inspection and review of the forces acting on the piers. The strength criteria accommodated the adverse effect of possible constructional discrepancies and the operational loads. The study reveals that the piers are subjected to excessive torsional moment arising from a possible scenario of partial loss of contact of the <b>tyre</b> with one <b>roller,</b> and consequently the piers were required to be strengthened by providing additional wall thickness. The proposed strengthening scheme: involves jacketing a new concrete wall of 250 mm thickness around the pier. The jacket was connected to the existing wall and foundation by closely spaced epoxy-grouted dowels and was cast by shotcreting using dry mix of Portland cement and aggregates...|$|R
40|$|An okra dryer was designed, {{constructed}} and evaluated {{in this study}} for post-harvest processing of the fruit. The dryer consists of a heating chamber, two drying trays, a blower of 1 hp, two heating elements of 2000 W each, 4 <b>roller</b> <b>tyres</b> for ease of mobility, a control box which consist of a thermostat that regulates {{the temperature in the}} dryer. The result of evaluation of the dryer in no load indicated that it was able to yield temperature very close to the preset (by the thermostat) after about 3 min. The dryer was evaluated by drying okra of different thickness (5 and 10 mm), in two trays at two heights (25 and 50 cm from the bottom) and at a preset temperatures of 50 º and 70 ºC. Moisture losses from the slices were obtained at intervals of 30, 45, 60 and 90 min. The result showed that increase in temperature from 50 º to 70 ºC, increases moisture loss from the slices. Slices of 5 mm thickness were observed to dry faster than 10 mm slices with those on the upper tray losing more moisture. The study further showed that slice thickness of 5 mm dried at 70 ºC in the upper tray level of 60 cm {{from the base of the}} dryer are suitable for drying okra slices in the dryer...|$|R
