5000|$|The {{tension between}} zero waste, viewed as post-discard <b>total</b> <b>recycling</b> of {{materials}} only, and zero waste as the reuse of all high level function remains a serious one today. It {{is probably the}} defining difference between established recyclers and emerging zero-wasters. A signature example {{is the difference between}} smashing a glass bottle (recovering cheap glass) and refilling the bottle (recovering the entire function of the container). The tension between the literal application of natural processes and the creation of industry-specific more efficient reuse modalities is another tension. Many observers look to nature as an ultimate model for production and innovative materials. Others point out that industrial products are inherently non-natural (such as chemicals and plastics that are mono-molecular) and benefit greatly from industrial methods of reuse, while natural methods requiring degradation and reconstitution are wasteful in that context. Biodegradable plastic is the most prominent example. One side argues that biodegradation of plastic is wasteful because plastic is expensive and environmentally damaging to make. Whether made of starch or petroleum, the manufacturing process expends all the same materials and energy costs. Factories are built, raw materials are procured, investments are made, machinery is built and used, humans labor and make use of all normal human inputs for education, housing, food etc. Even if the plastic is biodegraded after a single use, all of those costs are lost so it is much more important to design plastic parts for multiple reuse or perpetual lives. The other side argues that keeping plastic out of a dump or the sea is the sole benefit of interest. Companies moving towards [...] "zero landfill" [...] plants include Subaru, Xerox and Anheuser-Busch.|$|E
5000|$|Compared to {{developed}} OECD states, Brazil has a fairly low <b>total</b> <b>recycling</b> rate, being at 2% of created waste. [...] As in 2012 merely 14% of municipalities provided {{selective waste collection}} - with 86% of these municipalities located in either the South or Southeastern region - the country relies heavily on waste pickers. Additionally to that, only 64% {{of the population has}} access to regular garbage collection. Yet, the situation is improving since the absolute number of municipalities offering selective collection rose from 443 in 2010 to 766 in 2012.Despite its low overall recycling rate, Brazil is the world leader in recycling aluminum. Having set a record recycling rate of 98,4% of aluminum, the country was able to top its record 97,1% from 2013 by another 1,3%. The main reason for the extreme aluminum recycling rate are the rising energy costs - which will continue to rise given the increasing hydropower prices caused by the 2015 drought - and consequently, the high expenses that are associated with the production of new aluminum. As between March 2014 and March 2015 the cost of energy rose by 60% and since recycling aluminum requires 95% less energy than producing new material, the recycling rates have kept rising while smelter plants have been shutting down production. PET is the second most recycled packaging material in Brazil with 54% of PET having been recycled in 2014. However, due to lower production costs this rate is yet much smaller than the percentage of recycled aluminum. Given its very low production costs as well as the more expensive processes needed to recycle the material, plastics exhibit the lowest recycling rate among the most common packaging materials. The Brazilian beauty care and cosmetics brand Sejaa serves as an example for products that use recycled packaging. Sejaa, which was launched by Brazilian fashion model Gisele Bündchen uses fibers consisting to 100% of recycled post-consumer waste paper and is Forest Stewardship certified. Another example is Brazilian pulp and paper manufacturer Suzano, which since 2012 produces paperboard made from Post consumer resin (PCR) by extracting fibers from long life packaging such as milk cartons.|$|E

METHODS: IgG was obtained from 4 patients with LEMS (3 males, 1 female), including 2 patients with lung malignancy. Antibodies against P/Q-type VGCCs were detected in all 4 patients, and against N-type VGCCs in 2. We incubated neuronal cultures with LEMS IgG and determined {{the size of the}} <b>total</b> <b>recycling</b> pool of synaptic vesicles and the rate of action potential-evoked exocytosis using fluorescence imaging of the amphiphilic dye SynaptoRed C 1.

40|$|The current {{world view}} of the production, usage and {{disposal}} of plastics, especially flexible plastic packaging, {{is that of a}} tale that has generated several environmental and sustainability issues. In excess of 7 % of world fossil, a non-renewable resource, is used as feedstock and energy for the production of plastics. Over 250 kt of waste plastics may already be floating and contaminating the world’s seas leading to the death of thousands of marine life and other animals; with an estimated 10 % microplastics capable of finding their way into the food chain. The ever-increasing demand for plastics products, is liable to significantly increase these figures in the not too distant future. However, advances in technologies and systems for the collection, identification, sorting, separation and reprocessing of recyclable plastics are providing new prospects for recycling to closing the loop. Recycling provides opportunities to reduce oil, gas and coal usage; greenhouse gas emissions; the unleashing of plastics debris into the oceans and other water bodies; and the quantities, by volume and weight, of waste requiring disposal. Challenges involved in the collection, separation and sorting systems of plastic wastes have effectively limited it recycling rate and consequently made it arguably the least recycled waste stream; yet it is the most plentiful (i. e. by volume) of post-consumer wastes. In recent years, automated sorting has influenced and changed the way plastic wastes are segregated from other waste fractions and contaminants. This study examined how emerging and existing automated separation technologies performance could help impact and further improve the recycling process and caused corresponding significant increase in recycling rate. With Finland as case study, the focus was on the collection and utilization of mixed residual waste from municipal solid waste; and how processing this stream using separation technologies with high performance could help increase the recycling rate of plastics fraction (i. e. polymers) present in the stream. Ensuing case results suggested that with a source separation efficiency of 40 - 60 %, it is possible to recover for recycling nearly half (i. e. 48 %) of the total plastic packaging present in the mixed residual waste. This further increased plastic packaging recycling rate by 29. In this wise, it made about 102000 additional tonnes of plastic packaging available for <b>recycling.</b> <b>Total</b> plastic waste amount in the residual waste was found to be 16. 8 % of the total mixed residual waste.

40|$|SummaryThe {{kinetics}} of exo-endocytotic recycling could restrict {{information transfer}} at central synapses if neurotransmission were entirely reliant on classical full-collapse fusion. Nonclassical fusion retrieval by kiss-and-run would be kinetically advantageous but remains controversial. We used a hydrophilic quencher, bromophenol blue (BPB), to help detect nonclassical events. Upon stimulation, extracellular BPB entered synaptic vesicles and quenched FM 1 - 43 fluorescence, indicating retention of FM dye beyond first fusion. BPB also quenched fluorescence of VAMP (synaptobrevin- 2) -EGFP, thus indicating {{the timing of}} first fusion of vesicles in the <b>total</b> <b>recycling</b> pool. Comparison with FM dye destaining revealed that kiss-and-run strongly prevailed over full-collapse fusion at low frequency, giving way to a near-even balance at high frequency. Quickening of kiss-and-run vesicle reuse was also observed at higher frequency in the average single vesicle fluorescence response. Kiss-and-run and reuse could enable hippocampal nerve terminals to conserve scarce vesicular resources when responding to widely varying input patterns...|$|E

A successive refinement method with non-increasing number of binary variables is developed and successfully applied. Computational experiences with GAMS/DICOPT are presented. Using our new membrane superstructure representation, the hybrid system can be optimized effectively. The optimization method developed is also successfully applied for process intensification of an industrial scale dehydration plant. Compared to the existing plant, 12 % savings in the total annual cost can be achieved by applying 32 % additional membrane surface, in consequence of a radical decrease in the reflux ratio (3. 3 : 1. 4) in the column, and of producing less concentrated alcohol in the distillate.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Elsevier via the DOI in this record. Electronic waste (e-waste) contains {{a wide range of}} elements, many of which are highly toxic to environmental and human health. On the other hand e-waste represents a significant potential source of valuable metals. This study used microbial oxidation of pyrite to generate a biolixiviant. Its efficiency in the dissolution of metals from printed circuit boards (PCBs) was evaluated as well as the effects of metals and PCB concentrations on microbial activity. The addition of elemental metals (Cu, Cr, Ni, Sn, Zn) had an immediate inhibitory effect on pyrite oxidation, though leaching recovered after a period of adaptation. Bioleaching was inhibited initially by the addition of 1 % (w/v) ground PCB, but recovered rapidly, whereas pulp densities of ≥ 5 % had sustained negative impacts on culture activity and viability. The loss of culture viability meant that only abiotic copper dissolution occurred at ≥ 5 % PCB. Final copper recoveries declinedwith increasing PCB pulp density. The relatively high content of elemental iron caused a lag period in copper solubilisation possibly due to displacement reactions. Leptospirillum ferriphilum was primarily responsible for pyrite oxidation, and most affected by both the pure metals (particularly Ni and Cu) and PCB.
