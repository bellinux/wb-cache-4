40|$|<b>Thinning</b> <b>and</b> burning forests {{established}} on revegetated mine pits in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forests of south-west Australia is being {{considered as a}} management option to accelerate succession in sites with excessive tree densities. To {{assess the impact of}} <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> burning on reptiles and small mammals, we installed trapping grids in eight <b>thinned</b> <b>and</b> burned sites, each paired with untreated controls. Of the eight pairs, four were in rehabilitated sites (planted with nonlocal species) and four were in restored sites (seeded with local species). <b>Thinning</b> <b>and</b> burning had no significant impact on the small mammal community, although Cercatetus concinnus was more abundant in rehabilitated sites. In contrast, <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> burning significantly increased reptile abundance and species richness, with two species (Morethia obscura and Menetia greyii) only recorded in <b>thinned</b> <b>and</b> burned sites. We concluded that <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> burning was a successful management option in revegetated mine pits in jarrah forests, particularly because reptile communities created by <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> burning were more similar to those in unmined forest. Although published studies for comparison are few, we expect <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> burning to have generally positive effects on reptile communities in forest ecosystems where fire is an important disturbance agent. Our study emphasizes the importance of monitoring revegetated areas over time periods sufficient to detect deviations from desired successional trajectories, so that management options, such as <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> burning, can be implemented if required...|$|R

5|$|The Patries {{envelope}} {{was composed}} of four alternating layers of cotton cloth and vulcanised rubber (the envelope of its predecessor, the Jaune, comprised three layers). The outside layer was of cotton cloth, covered with lead chromate to prevent the actinic components of sunlight from destroying the rubber skin which formed the second layer. This second layer prevented leakage of the hydrogen lifting gas from the envelope. The third layer was of cotton, which was protected by the rubber fourth and final layer from damage caused by the hydrogen. This final rubber layer was <b>thinner,</b> <b>and</b> therefore lighter, than the first. The rubber sheeting for the second and fourth layers was supplied by the German company Continental AG.|$|E

Its prevailing direction is from the west, except in summer when winds are more variable. Because of the area's tropical location (where the ozone layer is <b>thinner)</b> <b>and</b> high altitude, it receives a large amount of ultraviolet radiation. The world's highest level of ultraviolet radiation was reported from Licancabur, although the high irradiation might have caused measurement artifacts.|$|E

When the two men meet face to face, Svidrigaïlov acknowledges this fact, and suggests that he may use it against him, should he need to. Svidrigaïlov also speaks of his own past, and Raskolnikov grows to suspect that the rumors about his having committed several murders are true. In a later conversation with Dunya, Svidrigaïlov denies that he had a hand in the death of his wife.|$|E
5|$|L.lubrica fruit {{bodies are}} similar to those of Cudonia confusa, {{commonly}} known as the cinnamon jellybaby. The species can be differentiated by the fact that L.lubrica fruit bodies are more sturdy, and those of C.confusa are much paler in colour. Another Cudonia species, C. circinans (which is highly similar to C. lutea), is similar to L. lubrica, though it can be differentiated by its colour (which is more brown), spores (which are smaller and <b>thinner)</b> <b>and</b> texture (which is less slimy and gelatinous than L. lubrica). L. lubrica fruit bodies can also be mistaken for those of the much rarer L.atrovirens, which can be differentiated by its darker colouration. L.viscosa can again be differentiated by colouration; the species has a green head. However, as L. lubrica fruit bodies can sometimes have a greenish hue, differentiation between the two species is not always easy.|$|E

5|$|The battleships of {{the late}} 1880s, for {{instance}} the , were armoured with iron and steel compound armour. This was soon replaced with more effective case-hardened steel armour made using the Harvey process developed in the United States. First tested in 1891, Harvey armour was commonplace in ships laid down from 1893–1895. However, its reign was brief; in 1895, the German Kaiser Friedrich III pioneered the superior Krupp armour. Europe adopted Krupp plate within five years, and only the United States persisted in using Harvey steel into the 20th century. The improving quality of armour plate meant that new ships could have better protection from a <b>thinner</b> <b>and</b> lighter armour belt; 12inches (305mm) of compound armour provided the same protection as just 7.5inches (190mm) of Harvey or 5.75inches (133mm) of Krupp.|$|E
5|$|The {{wings of}} bats are much <b>thinner</b> <b>and</b> consist of more bones {{than that of}} birds, {{allowing}} bats to maneuver more accurately and fly with more lift and less drag. By folding the wings inwards towards their body on the upstroke, they use 35% less energy during flight than birds. The membranes are delicate, ripping easily; however, the tissue of the bat's membrane is able to regrow, such that small tears can heal quickly. The surface of their wings is equipped with touch-sensitive receptors on small bumps called Merkel cells, also found on human fingertips. These sensitive areas are different in bats, as each bump has a tiny hair in the center, making it even more sensitive and allowing the bat to detect and collect information about the air flowing over its wings, and to fly more efficiently by changing the shape of its wings in response.|$|E

30|$|As {{far as we}} know, {{there is}} {{currently}} a limited discussion on various factors influencing the production on these <b>thin</b> <b>and</b> poor reservoirs within the literature, particularly on the injection/production type and well pattern and spacing. Reservoir research shows that near 40 % of the <b>thin</b> <b>and</b> poor reservoir thickness is not water washing in Daqing Oilfield (Dai 2012; Zhang and Hu 2013). It is particularly important to develop the <b>thin</b> <b>and</b> poor reservoir effectively. In this paper, we analyze the influence of several development factors on producing <b>thin</b> <b>and</b> poor reservoirs, including the injection/production type, well pattern and spacing. This is accomplished by using geological modeling and IMPES simulation of the middle of Block Xing 6, Xingshugang Oilfield, China. This Block mostly consists of argillaceous sandstones in the <b>thin</b> <b>and</b> poor reservoir with poor physical properties and permeability, oil immersion, oil patch and oil trace, combined complex spatial distribution. The remaining oil distribution is highly scattered, and the producing thickness is still not ideal.|$|R
5|$|The RAF {{activated}} 20 squadrons between September 1958 and December 1959 {{to operate}} the 120 Thor missiles. They were located at 20 old wartime airfields so that {{the government did not}} have to purchase the land. Each missile was supplied with its own Mark 49 warhead, a variant of the Mark 28 with a <b>thinner</b> <b>and</b> lighter casing. While the Thor missile bases were manned by the RAF, the warheads were supplied under Project E. Each one had a USAF authorisation officer. The missiles used a dual key system, one of which was held by the authorisation officer. Occasionally a missile would be chosen for test firing, for which the missile and its RAF crew would be flown to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Twelve test firings were conducted between 6 October 1959 and 12 June 1962. Under the original agreement, the USAF paid the cost of maintenance for the missiles for five years. After a debate over costs and benefits, the Air Council decided on 31 May 1962 that Project Emily should be terminated by the end of 1963. The last Thor squadrons were inactivated on 23 August 1963. The missiles were returned to the United States.|$|E
5|$|The African {{elephant}} {{was first}} named by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in 1797 as Elephas africanus. The genus Loxodonta was named by Frédéric Cuvier in 1825. Cuvier spelled it Loxodonte, but in 1827 an anonymous author romanised the spelling to Loxodonta; the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature recognises {{this as the}} proper authority. In 1942, 18 subspecies of African elephant were recognised by Henry Fairfield Osborn, but further morphological data has {{reduced the number of}} classified subspecies, and by the 1990s, only two were recognised, the savannah or bush elephant (L.a.africana) and the forest elephant (L.a.cyclotis), the latter having been named in 1900 by German zoologist Paul Matschie. Forest elephants have smaller and more rounded ears and <b>thinner</b> <b>and</b> straighter tusks than bush elephants, and are limited in range to the forested areas of western and Central Africa. A 2000 study argued for the elevation of the two forms into separate species (L.africana and L.cyclotis respectively) based on differences in skull morphology. DNA studies published in 2001 and 2007 also suggested they were distinct species while studies in 2002 and 2005 concluded that they were the same species. Further studies (2010, 2011, 2015) have supported African savannah and forest elephants' status as separate species. The two species are believed to have diverged 6 million years ago. In 2017, DNA sequence analysis showed that L. cyclotis is more closely related to the extinct Palaeoloxodon antiquus, than it is to L. africana, possibly undermining the genus Loxodonta as a whole. Some evidence suggests that elephants of western Africa are a separate species, although this is disputed. The pygmy elephants of the Congo Basin, which have been suggested to be a separate species (Loxodonta pumilio) are probably forest elephants whose small size and/or early maturity are due to environmental conditions.|$|E
