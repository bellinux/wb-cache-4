5|$|After {{the initial}} reports, Donaghy stayed at his home, {{before moving to}} a secure {{location}} to avoid the media scrutiny. He surrendered on August 15, 2007, and pleaded guilty to two felony charges of conspiracy. He told judges that he had used coded language <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> others about players' physical condition and player/referee relations, and he specifically admitted to passing information about two games during the 2006–07 season. In total, he received $30,000 to pass inside information to the bookies. Donaghy also {{admitted that he had}} a severe gambling addiction, and was on medication to address it. He was released on a $250,000 bond.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} early 1847, but {{relationships}} between the LB and SER broke down quickly. The SER were unhappy about the proposed line from Rye to Hastings via , which they viewed as too expensive compared to the alternative route via Whatlington. The LB objected to this route as it was longer, and consequently the SER dropped their proposals in November 1847. The land over Romney Marsh was unstable, and test trains were seen <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> over in heavy winds. The line was originally proposed to be single-track, though this was changed to double-track in June 1850.|$|E
5|$|Like most theropods, abelisaurids were {{carnivorous}} bipeds. They {{were characterized}} by stocky hindlimbs and extensive ornamentation of the skull bones, with grooves and pits. In many abelisaurids, like Carnotaurus, the forelimbs are vestigial, the skull is shorter and bony crests grow above the eyes. Most of the known abelisaurids would have been between 5 and 9meters (17 to 30ft) in length, from snout <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> of tail, with a new and as yet unnamed specimen from northwestern Turkana in Kenya, Africa reaching a possible length of 11–12 meters (36 to 39 feet). Before becoming well known, fragmentary abelisaurid remains were occasionally misidentified as possible South American tyrannosaurids.|$|E

Despite Danny's {{lack of interest in}} singing on the show, Pete gives him the Christmas solo as revenge for Jenna not chipping in <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> the cleaning ladies, which is a yearly source of frustration for Pete. Jenna is outraged when she hears Danny was assigned the solo, and tries to get Subhas the janitor to punch Danny in the throat. But when the agreeable Danny learns of Jenna's hurt feelings, he arranges for them to perform a duet, in which he sings off-key to make Jenna look good.|$|E
5|$|The family disapproves of {{his first}} few inventions, {{including}} a make-up shotgun, electric hammer, alarm that never stops beeping, and reclining chair with a built-in toilet, making Homer more depressed. However, they like one particular invention, a chair with two hinged legs on the back, making it impossible <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> over backwards. Homer is encouraged until he notices his poster of Edison shows him sitting in {{the same type of}} chair. Bart points out that the chair is not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning he never told anyone of this invention.|$|E

5|$|With unarticulated wheels, {{climbing}} obstacles {{will cause}} {{the body of a}} vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the wheelbase or axle track, the vehicle will become statically unstable, and will tend <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> over. At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.|$|E
5|$|During that night, a storm blew up and {{approximately}} 200 soldiers {{were assigned to}} the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind was strong enough to pull some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> on her side, which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. Even then the Patrie could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, the troops were unable to keep control her and thus could not continue to hold her down in the storm.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the very}} few {{confirmed}} attacks on humans by wild killer whales, none have been fatal. In one instance, killer whales tried <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> ice floes on which a dog team and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition were standing. The sled dogs' barking is speculated to have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the killer whale's hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals was bumped by a killer whale that apparently misidentified him as prey. Unlike wild killer whales, captive killer whales are reported to have made nearly two dozen attacks on humans since the 1970s, {{some of which have}} been fatal.|$|E

5|$|Three circulations {{developed}} {{within the}} monsoon trough that {{extended from the}} Philippines to the Marshall Islands, {{at the beginning of}} October 1979. The westernmost disturbance developed into Typhoon Sarah west of Luzon, on October 1. On October 3, a disturbance southwest of Guam developed into Tropical Storm Roger, and later on the same day, a third tropical disturbance that would later become Typhoon Tip formed south of Pohnpei. Strong flow from across the equator was drawn into Roger's wind circulation, initially preventing significant development of the precursor disturbance <b>to</b> <b>Tip.</b> Despite the unfavorable air pattern, the tropical disturbance gradually organized as it moved westward. Due to the large-scale circulation pattern of Tropical Storm Roger, Tip's precursor moved erratically and slowly executed a cyclonic loop to the southeast of Chuuk. A reconnaissance aircraft flight into the system late on October 4 confirmed the existence of a closed low-level circulation, and early on October 5, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued its first warning on Tropical Depression Twenty-Three.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or clepsydrae, were {{commonly}} used in Ancient Greece following their introduction by Plato, who also invented a water-based alarm clock. One account of Plato's alarm clock describes it as depending on the nightly overflow of a vessel containing lead balls, which floated in a columnar vat. The vat held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> over, causing the lead balls to cascade onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the Academy. Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a siphon. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar. There, the rising water would force air through a whistle, sounding an alarm. The Greeks and Chaldeans regularly maintained timekeeping records as {{an essential part of}} their astronomical observations.|$|E

25|$|The 703 was a wood framed {{aircraft}} {{covered with}} a mixture of plywood and fabric. Its cantilever mid-mounted wing had a single spar and an associated D-box, skinned in plywood, formed the leading edge. The wing was fabric covered behind the spar. The leading edge was straight from root <b>to</b> <b>tip,</b> with slight sweep-back. From root out almost to half-span the wing tapered in plan only gently but further out, where the trailing edge was entirely formed by the aileron the wing tapered more strongly to a rounded tip. The NACA-derived airfoil provided a high maximum lift coefficient and small pitching moments and the wing had washout to avoid tip stall. There were Schempp-Hirth style airbrakes mounted on the rear of the spar in the central section, extending above and below the wing. On the first two 703s the central sections were set with strong (6.5°) dihedral and the outer section with none, forming a gull wing. The third 703 had the same wing but with constant dihedral from root <b>to</b> <b>tip.</b>|$|E
