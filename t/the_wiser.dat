5|$|Keith Park, with {{endorsement}} from Dowding, {{opted for}} the opposite strategy. Park maintained that it was unimportant to inflict large losses on the Germans in comparison to safeguarding his own forces. Park believed the Germans would give up if they could not achieve their aim of air superiority. This, simply put, meant avoiding the destruction and or depletion of Fighter Command was the primary factor in air defence. This would be achieved by sending small numbers of fighters to intercept, minimising losses in the air. By remaining to offer undiminished and constant air opposition, the RAF ensured the Luftwaffe could not win. As long {{as some sort of}} cost was imposed before the enemy dropped his bombs and impaired the defence system, the RAF could remain intact to meet the threat again the next day. To this end, Park favoured the 10 bomber kills before the attack, rather than the 50 shot down after it. The strategy suggested an enemy would give up if he felt he was getting nowhere. For even while his losses remained moderate, it would be senseless to suffer those casualties for no return. Park and Dowding's strategy, under the circumstances, was <b>the</b> <b>wiser</b> choice.|$|E

25|$|In living {{specimens}} of N. sp. {{the base of}} the leaf is petiolate in the lower 4-5 cm with the leaf edges curled upwards. When pressed they are flattened and the leaf is narrowly lanceolate as in Danser's drawing of N. mollis. The leaf-sheathing on pressed plants of N. sp. is also flattened and looks decurrent instead. Without reference to a living plant you would be none <b>the</b> <b>wiser.</b> Could this be the same with Danser's N. mollis specimen? The degree of supposed leaf decurrence and the bracts on the pedicels can be explained by natural variation within the range of this species. There are enough high mountains between those that contain N. sp. (G. Lumarku, G. Murud, Meligan Range) in the northwest and N. mollis (G. Kemul) in the southeast to provide a link between the two.|$|E

25|$|One thing more: at {{the close}} of the Civil War, when the problem of the emancipated slaves was before the nation, it might have left them in a {{condition}} of alienage, or established them as wards of the government, like the Indian tribes, and thus retained for the nation jurisdiction over them, or it might, as it did, give them citizenship. It chose the latter. By the Fourteenth Amendment, it made citizens of all born within the limits of the United States and subject to its jurisdiction. By the Fifteenth, it prohibited any state from denying the right of suffrage on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and by the Thirteenth, it forbade slavery or involuntary servitude anywhere within the limits of the land. Whether this was or was not <b>the</b> <b>wiser</b> way to deal with the great problem is not a matter for the courts to consider. It is for us to accept the decision, which declined to constitute them wards of the nation or leave them in a condition of alienage where they would be subject to the jurisdiction of Congress, but gave them citizenship, doubtless believing that thereby, in the long run, their best interests would be subserved, they taking their chances with other citizens in the states where they should make their homes.|$|E

2500|$|Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719) was {{the first}} major novel of the new century and was {{published}} in more editions than any other works besides Gulliver's Travels (Mullan 252). [...] Defoe worked as a journalist during and after its composition, and therefore he encountered the memoirs of Alexander Selkirk, who had been stranded in South America on an island for some years. [...] Defoe took aspects of the actual life and, from that, generated a fictional life, satisfying an essentially journalistic market with his fiction (Hunter 331–338). In the 1720s, Defoe interviewed famed criminals and produced accounts of their lives. In particular, he investigated Jack Sheppard and Jonathan Wild and wrote True Accounts of the former's escapes (and fate) and the latter's life. From his reportage on the prostitutes and criminals, Defoe may have become familiar with the real-life Mary Mollineaux, who may have been the model for Moll in Moll Flanders (1722). [...] In the same year, Defoe produced A Journal of the Plague Year (1722), which summoned up the horrors and tribulations of 1665 for a journalistic market for memoirs, and an attempted tale of a working-class male rise in Colonel Jack (1722). [...] His last novel returned to the theme of fallen women in [...] (1724). Thematically, Defoe's works are consistently Puritan. [...] They all involve a fall, a degradation of the spirit, a conversion, and an ecstatic elevation. [...] This religious structure necessarily involved a bildungsroman, for each character had to learn a lesson about him or herself and emerge <b>the</b> <b>wiser.</b>|$|E

With its timely setting of a swiftly globalising India and, more specifically, the country's {{own version of the}} 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' TV show, combined with timeless melodrama and a hardworking orphan who withstands all manner of setbacks, 'Slumdog Millionaire' plays like Charles Dickens for the 21stcentury." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times describes the film as [...] "a Hollywood-style romantic melodrama that delivers major studio satisfactions in an ultra-modern way" [...] and [...] "a story of star-crossed romance that the original Warner brothers would have embraced, shamelessly pulling out stops that you wouldn't think anyone would have the nerve to attempt any more." [...] Anthony Lane of the New Yorker stated, [...] "There is a mismatch here. Boyle and his team, headed by the director of photography, Anthony Dod Mantle, clearly believe that a city like Mumbai, with its shifting skyline and a population of more than fifteen million, is as ripe for storytelling as Dickens's London [...] At the same time, the story they chose is sheer fantasy, not in its glancing details but in its emotional momentum.

She then fears Alfie will find out so tries to end the affair again. Her lover sends her a mobile phone to contact him on, but she bins it. However, when a romantic evening with Alfie goes wrong, she retrieves the phone and contacts her lover. She later receives a key to a nearby flat, and when Alfie pays more attention to the organisation of the football team, Kat heads to the flat to meet her lover, who is waiting. The affair continues with Alfie clueless. Kat hears that a fight has broken out between members of the football team, and fears that the truth has come out. However, it has not. The fight spills over into The Queen Victoria, and later, Kat tends to her lover's wounds.

Kat later ignores her lover's messages, and he tells her that he has got the message—that she is no longer interested. She throws away the key, but it is found by Jean Slater (Gillian Wright), who leaves it on the bar, thinking it belongs to a punter. Kat then takes it and later meets her lover at the flat.
