5000|$|In 1980, Reliance also {{acquired}} Foucar, Ray & Simon, {{a specialty}} <b>tube</b> <b>distributor</b> in Hayward, California, with a branch in Portland, Oregon. The Hayward center was eventually merged into the Reliance center in Santa Clara. The Portland operation foundered and then closed in 1984. Gimbel told Metal Service News the acquisition {{had been a}} mistake. [...] "Foucar was probably the second oldest service center in California, with a good reputation. They'd done well over the years, but I guess they'd gotten rigor mortis. We thought that we could change all that. We tried and tried to change it, and it didn't work. So we had to admit defeat and close up the place." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{capillary}} tube mat is a flat composite structure of thin tubes (capillaries) with a <b>distributor</b> <b>tube</b> and a collector tube. The main applications include cooling ceilings (radiant cooling) and underfloor heating.|$|R
40|$|Demand of subsidized LPG 3 -kgs in Indonesia {{has been}} {{increasing}} since the Indonesian government imposed a conversion program from kerosene to Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) in 2007. The high increase in demand for subsidized LPG 3 -kgs led to the scarcity of products availability. The design of a closed distribution system is required to ensure the availability of subsidized LPG 3 -kgs. In this research, the development model of the integration of closed loop supply chain network and vehicle routing problem with simultaneous deliveries and pick-ups with time windows has been proposed. The mechanism of closed distribution system starts from the distributors send LPG empty tubes to filling stations. After filling station inspected and filled the LPG <b>tubes,</b> <b>distributors</b> delivered LPG 3 -kgs subsidized from the filling station to some retailers. At the same time, the distributors take back the empty tubes from these retailers by considering the limitations of operational time in each retailers. The proposed model was tested on numerical example and analyzed the result...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of convective heat transfer from horizontal tube bundle (19 mm dia., 3 rows, staggered) {{in a shallow}} square fluidized bed (0. 4 Ã— 0. 4 m in cross section) were studied experimentally. The effect of tube location (height of <b>tube</b> from <b>distributor),</b> static bed height and superficial gas velocity on heat transfer were clarified. It {{was found that the}} circumferencial distribution of local heat transfer coefficient qualitatively agreed with previous experimental results and average heat transfer coefficient on the tubes located above the mean expanded bed surface was very low...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{object of}} this research, {{project was to}} study how {{different}} parameters effect the magnitude and frequency composition of forces exerted on simulated heat exchange tubes immersed in a cold fluidized bed. Two arrays of tubes were assembled with the tubes mounted in an equilateral triangular pitch pattern. The center column of tubes in each array was instrumented with bi-directional strain gage load cells. The parameters varied and studied during this experimental research were the superficial air velocity, the spacing between centers of the tubes, {{the distance between the}} distributor plate and the bottom tube, and the mean particle diameter. A digital force-time series of the force exerted on each of the instrumented tubes was obtained in both the vertical and horizontal planes. Results are given {{in the form of a}} plot of the force-time history and a statistical analysis for both the tube in the array experiencing the most severe loading and the simultaneous sum of the loads experienced by all of the instrumented tubes. The statistical analysis includes the mean and variance of the digital force-time series and a plot of power spectral density verses frequency. Also shown are plots indicating how the statistical results vary with changes in superficial air velocity while holding all other parameters constant. The severity of loads on single tubes as well as the sum of the loads on all of the instrumented tubes varied with changes in the tube spacing, the height of the <b>tubes</b> above the <b>distributor</b> plate, and the air velocity. Peak vertical loads exceeded 140 lbs on individual tubes and 200 lbs on a complete column of instrumented tubes, while the horizontal loads were always less than half as severe as the vertical loads...|$|R
