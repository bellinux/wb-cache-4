One of the aims of Predictive <b>Techniques</b> <b>in</b> Environmental Impact assessment is to achieve sustainable development in developing countries, but uncertainty prevails as to whether the Predictive <b>Techniques</b> <b>in</b> Environmental Impact assessment is doing what it promises to do. Close to 200 studies on the Predictive <b>Techniques</b> <b>in</b> Environmental Impact assessment have been carried out since its birth in 1997 including peer-reviewed articles and reports from the grey literature. However, no overview of the different debates and key issues <b>in</b> the Predictive <b>Techniques</b> <b>in</b> Environmental Impact assessment exists.

The {{research}} purposes {{to investigate and}} to analyze the kinds of techniques used by teacher in teaching English at Islamic Religious Department of IAIN Antasari Banjarmasin. The statement {{of the problems in}} this research are: what kinds of teacher’s <b>techniques</b> <b>in</b> teaching English at Islamic Religious Department, how does the teacher apply the <b>techniques</b> <b>in</b> teaching English at Islamic Religious Department and how the students’ responses toward the teacher’s <b>techniques</b> <b>in</b> teaching English at Islamic Religious Department of IAIN Antasari Banjarmasin. The subjects of this research are four teachers and sixty students of English class at Islamic Religious Department of IAIN Antasari Banjarmasin. The objects of this research are teacher’s <b>techniques</b> <b>in</b> teaching English at Islamic Religious Department, the application and the students’ responses toward the teacher’s <b>techniques</b> <b>in</b> teaching English at Islamic Religious Department of IAIN Antasari Banjarmasin.

Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. Uranium-235 makes up only about 0.72% of natural uranium, so the separation factor of any uranium enrichment process needs to be higher than 1250 to produce 90% uranium-235 from natural uranium. The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another <b>technique</b> <b>in</b> 1934: electromagnetic separation.
