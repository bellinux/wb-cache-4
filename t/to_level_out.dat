25|$|I saw the Curtiss planes {{approximately}} 300 meters {{below us}} and falling away below. These aircraft were {{no threat to}} us whatsoever! Now I just wanted <b>to</b> <b>level</b> <b>out</b> of my turning bank, since my colleagues were already at a substantially higher altitude. Keppler (his wingman), overshot me. Once again, I saw the Curtiss planes 300 meters directly below me and counted eleven aircraft.|$|E
25|$|At {{the senior}} and under 18 age level, each state sends its select {{representative}} team. At under 15 level, a national tournament exists whereby member states send anywhere {{between one and}} three representative teams, in an effort <b>to</b> <b>level</b> <b>out</b> the competition between stronger and developing lacrosse regions. At present there are national carnivals at the senior, under 18 and under 15 levels {{for both men and}} women. Often a number of these events are held concurrently at the same venue.|$|E
25|$|Features {{shown by}} the Viking orbiters in 1976 {{revealed}} two possible ancient shorelines near the pole, Arabia and Deuteronilus, each thousands of kilometers long. Several physical features in the present geography of Mars suggest the past existence of a primordial ocean. Networks of gullies that merge into larger channels imply erosion by a liquid flow and resemble ancient riverbeds on Earth. Enormous channels, 25km wide and several hundred meters deep, appear to have flowed directly from underground aquifers in the Southern uplands into the Northern plains. Much of the northern hemisphere of Mars is at a significantly lower elevation {{than the rest of}} the planet (the Martian dichotomy), and is unusually flat. The low elevation would cause water, if it existed, to gather there. An ocean would tend <b>to</b> <b>level</b> <b>out</b> the ground underneath it.|$|E

50|$|What is the {{historian}} trying to do? First, {{on the most}} rudimentary <b>level,</b> <b>to</b> find <b>out</b> what happened. Then, at a rather more sophisticated <b>level,</b> <b>to</b> find <b>out</b> how it happened. And, for the intellectually ambitious, why it happened. This is surely the really interesting part of understanding the past.|$|R
2500|$|Possible {{fragments}} of statues {{have been found}} in the sacred building of [...] "Sa Sedda 'e Sos Carros" [...] (Oliena), dedicated to the cult of water; some quoins, used as raw stone material <b>to</b> <b>level</b> <b>out</b> the stone floor, show traces of relief decorations reminiscent of those on the {{fragments of}} shields from Mont'e Prama; this possible link is reinforced by the finding of a putative fragment of a foot.|$|E
2500|$|At {{some point}} between 1125 and 1250 (cf. [...] ), the Parsis {{inserted}} an embolismic month <b>to</b> <b>level</b> <b>out</b> the accumulating fractional days. However, the Parsis {{would be the}} only Zoroastrians to do so (and would do it only once), with the result that – from then on – the calendar in use by the Parsis and the calendar in use by Zoroastrians elsewhere diverged by a matter of thirty days. The calendars still had the same name, Shahenshahi (imperial), presumably because none were aware that the calendars were no longer the same.|$|E
2500|$|Turkish Airlines Flight 981, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, on 3 March 1974. Similar to American Airlines Flight 96, {{the flight}} {{experienced}} an explosive decompression, when {{flying over the}} town of Meaux, France, caused by a rear cargo door failure. The rear main cabin floor collapsed and severed all flight controls. While the plane went into a vertical dive, the captain called for [...] "Speed!" [...] meaning increasing engine thrust to pull the plane's nose up. The plane began <b>to</b> <b>level</b> <b>out,</b> but had lost too much altitude and slammed into the Ermenonville Forest. All 346 people on board were killed upon impact, and it became the worst single aircraft disaster without survivors, and the fourth deadliest aviation death count ever.|$|E
50|$|Marx either solved {{this problem}} with {{his theory of}} prices of {{production}} and the tendency for profitability differentials <b>to</b> be <b>levelled</b> <b>out</b> through competition, or he failed to solve it, according to {{which side of the}} debate over the transformation problem one finds convincing.|$|R
50|$|The Bell is a {{variation}} of the tailslide maneuver, with the only difference being that the pilot performs a roll in the longitudinal axis during the final 1/4 loop (push or pull) while recovering <b>to</b> <b>level</b> flight, <b>out</b> of plane.|$|R

2500|$|The weight {{distribution}} of the P-39 was supposedly the reason for its tendency to enter a dangerous flat spin, a characteristic Soviet test pilots were able to demonstrate to the skeptical manufacturer who {{had been unable to}} reproduce the effect. After extensive tests, it was determined the spin could only be induced if the aircraft was improperly loaded, with no ammunition in the front compartment. The flight manual noted a need to ballast the front ammunition compartment with the appropriate weight of shell casings to achieve a reasonable center of gravity. High-speed controls were light, consequently high-speed turns and pull-outs were possible. The P-39 had to be held in a dive since it tended <b>to</b> <b>level</b> <b>out,</b> reminiscent of the Spitfire. The recommended never-exceed dive speed limit (Vne) was [...] for the P-39.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{inspired}} by Josef Steindl’s analysis, Ernest Mandel argued that if corporations monopolizing product markets can evade price competition {{to a considerable}} extent, they can also evade the general tendency for differences in profit rates <b>to</b> <b>level</b> <b>out</b> (in the direction of an average rate). Even if monopoly profit rates fell, they would usually remain higher than the profit rates of small and medium-sized firms. Sure, the monopolists could raise their prices only within certain limits, beyond which they would attract competitors (including other monopolists) able to supply alternative products at a lower price. Nevertheless, in reality, there existed not one, but two kinds of [...] "average profit rates" [...] in capitalist production: a higher one for corporations in the monopolized sectors of product markets, and a lower one for smaller firms in the non-monopolized sectors.|$|E
2500|$|Finally James Willis Dixon of Hillsborough House, {{owner of}} the Silversmiths James Dixon & Sons, offered a [...] site at Owlerton, a sparsely {{populated}} area of land to the northwest of the city. The land {{was part of the}} Hillsborough House estate which was being sold off by the Dixons. It was successfully bought for £5,000 plus costs. Soil was dumped {{at both ends of the}} ground <b>to</b> <b>level</b> <b>out</b> the ground which was initially meadowland covered with dandelions. The 2,000 capacity stand at Olive Grove was then transported to the new site and was joined by a newly-built 3,000 capacity stand for the start of the next season. The first match to be played was on 2 September 1899 against Chesterfield. The match was kicked off by the Lord Mayor of Sheffield William Clegg, himself a former Wednesday player. It was a Chesterfield player, Herbert Munday, who scored the first goal at the new stadium but Wednesday came back to win the game 5–1. Despite the location of the ground several miles outside the city boundaries and a poor public transport service the new ground averaged 3,000 supporters for the first three months.|$|E
50|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the larger}} palimpsests like Memphis Facula suggests that Ganymede's icy crust {{at the time of}} impact was about 10 km thick and was penetrated by the impact, allowing the slush and fluid beneath <b>to</b> fill and <b>level</b> <b>out</b> the crater.|$|R
5000|$|The machine {{chest is}} {{basically}} a consistency levelling chest having about 15 minutes retention. This is enough retention time to allow any variations in consistency entering the chest <b>to</b> be <b>levelled</b> <b>out</b> {{by the action of}} the basis weight valve receiving feedback from the on line basis weight measuring scanner. (Note: Many paper machines mistakenly control consistency coming out of the machine chest, interfering with basis weight control.) ...|$|R
30|$|On {{the grounds}} of this {{profound}} intuition of Leopardi’s, {{it is not just}} acceptable but dutiful to conclude that the environment in which we live inexorably decays and grows ugly if we remain prisoners of a gaze that “sees without feeling” and, devoid as it is of any ability <b>to</b> imagine, <b>levels</b> <b>out</b> reality as it appears to lazy eyes and a perceptive structure incapable of expressing and producing that “second image” of which Leopardi speaks (Leopardi 1997).|$|R
2500|$|The {{incident}} necessitated {{the deployment}} of the safety car on the following lap to allow Vergne's car to be extracted from the track and the entire field elected to make pit stops for the mandatory change into a second vehicle. Dragon teammates Duval and d'Ambrosio were the first drivers to enter the pit lane, and after the safety car pulled into the pit lane on lap 26, racing resumed with Buemi leading di Grassi and Heidfeld. Buemi again started {{to pull away from}} di Grassi and was one second ahead of him after completing one lap. D'Ambrosio moved out of the train of cars a few laps later, stopped and restarted his problematic car, causing him to drop down the field before entering the pit lane. [...] Duval joined his teammate in the garage with mechanical problems on the 31st lap. Bird set the race's fastest lap on his 24th lap, completing a circuit in 53.822 seconds, earning him one championship point. Buemi lifted and coasted as he attempted <b>to</b> <b>level</b> <b>out</b> the electrical energy difference between himself and di Grassi; he used FanBoost to maintain the advantage he had built up over the latter. Elsewhere, Gutiérrez was investigated by the stewards for an unsafe pit stop release but elected not to penalise the driver. The primary battle at this point was between Piquet, Engel, Rosenqvist and Abt but all four drivers drove reasonably to allow them one large push at the race's conclusion.|$|E

50|$|A muddy valley {{up until}} the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the Hollow was eventually reclaimed as a civic center by laying down a two-foot layer of black ash, from Forest Paper Company, <b>to</b> <b>level</b> it <b>out.</b> After constructing two new schools, the Merrill Memorial Library and a war memorial, town officials also decided to rename the area Centervale in order to improve its image. The name did not last, however.|$|R
50|$|Between 2005 and 2011, Greece has had {{the highest}} {{percentage}} increase in industrial output compared <b>to</b> 2005 <b>levels</b> <b>out</b> of all European Union members, with an increase of 6%. Eurostat statistics show that the industrial sector was hit by the Greek financial crisis throughout 2009 and 2010, with domestic output decreasing by 5.8% and industrial production in general by 13.4%. Currently, Greece is ranked third in the European Union {{in the production of}} marble (over 920,000 tons), after Italy and Spain.|$|R

40|$|Follow-up has {{continued}} on the cohort of miners and millers of crocidolite from Wittenoom Gorge in Western Australia. Previous analyses had {{indicated that the}} incidence of meso-thelioma continued to rise exponentially past 40 yr after first exposure, but that fibres were cleared from the lungs with a half-life of ~ 7 yr. Success in follow-up has been improved through searches in Italy and in the Australian National Death Index. While the mesothelioma rate is still high, the incidence of the disease appears <b>to</b> have <b>levelled</b> <b>out</b> in this cohort...|$|R
50|$|Until {{payment from}} sales is received, it is {{uncertain}} {{how much of the}} surplus-value produced will actually be realised as profit from sales. So, the magnitude of profit realised in the form of money and the magnitude of surplus-value produced in the form of products may differ greatly, depending on what happens to market prices and the vagaries of supply and demand fluctuations. This insight forms the basis of Marx's theory of market value, prices of production and the tendency of the rate of profit of different enterprises <b>to</b> be <b>levelled</b> <b>out</b> by competition.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the stick}} is held fixed, the {{aircraft}} will not maintain straight and level flight, but will start <b>to</b> dive, <b>level</b> <b>out</b> and climb again. It will repeat this cycle until the pilot intervenes. This long period oscillation in speed and height {{is called the}} phugoid mode. This is analyzed by assuming that the SSPO performs its proper function and maintains the angle of attack near its nominal value. The two states which are mainly affected are the climb angle [...] (gamma) and speed. The small perturbation equations of motion are: ...|$|R
50|$|An {{equalization}} pool is a fund created <b>to</b> <b>level</b> <b>out</b> {{differences in}} financial risk, often across {{long periods of}} time, in {{a process known as}} risk equalization. Examples include mandatory health insurance and grower co-operatives.|$|E
50|$|Continuing eastward {{from the}} bluffs, the road starts <b>to</b> <b>level</b> <b>out</b> into gently rolling farmland. SR 178 intersects SR 59 {{in the town}} of Gilt Edge, Tennessee.

50|$|The {{main purpose}} of the act is <b>to</b> <b>level</b> <b>out</b> inequalities in {{bargaining}} power between the consumer and the merchant. The law annuls any contract term that contravenes this (similarly to, say, the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 in the United Kingdom).|$|E
5000|$|Next, {{the train}} turns {{left in a}} slight decline before {{leveling}} out. Once leveled, it enters the diving circular helix into the ravine. This is achieved by the left rail lowering much more steeply than the right rail as the train descends into a left-turning spiral. The train begins <b>to</b> climb and <b>level</b> <b>out</b> after reaching {{the bottom of the}} ravine, producing significant positive G-forces. After exiting the top of the helix, the train enters a hill followed by a U-turn and a second set of trim brakes as the track <b>levels</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
50|$|A neutral grip, {{similar to}} that used in the hammer curl, can also be used. With this {{variation}} the weight is again raised <b>to</b> eye <b>level,</b> but <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a 45 degree angle {{from the front of the}} body. This may be beneficial for those with shoulder injuries, particularly those related to the rotator cuff.|$|R
40|$|Note by the secretariat 1. The {{development}} of modern transport and related infrastructure {{is critical for}} the {{development of}} international trade and the international mobility of production factors. Transport services are horizontal: they service all sectors of the economy at various stages of production, distribution and consumption. From a geographical perspective, effective transportation contributes <b>to</b> <b>levelling</b> <b>out</b> regional imbalances both within countries and at the European level. This transport function is particularly important in view of the integration prospects in Europe and intensified exchanges between the European Union (EU) and the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC). 2. In statistical terms, transport services include activities related to providing passenger or freight transport by rail, pipeline, road, water or air. Different types of transport vary considerably in terms of factor intensities. Rail and pipeline transport for example, are highly capital-intensive, whereas road transport is not. At the same time, rail transport and road transportare labour-intensive, whereas in the pipeline sector the labour costs are marginal. The UN/ECE secretariat would like to thank Mr. Astrit Sulstarova, an intern with the secretariat, for his contribution to the preparation of this addendum.
