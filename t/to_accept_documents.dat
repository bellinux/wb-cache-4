40|$|Abstract. Experiments on the {{effectiveness}} of relevance feedback with real users are time-consuming and expensive. This makes simulation for rapid testing desirable. We define a user model, which helps to quantify some interaction decisions involved in simulated relevance feedback. First, the relevance criterion defines the relevance threshold of the user <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>documents</b> as relevant to his/her needs. Second, the browsing effort refers to the patience of the user to browse through the initial list of retrieved documents in order to give feedback. Third, the feedback effort refers to the effort and ability of the user to collect feedback documents. We use the model to construct several simulated relevance feedback scenarios in a laboratory setting. Using TREC data providing graded relevance assessments, we study the effect of {{the quality and quantity of}} the feedback documents on {{the effectiveness}} of the relevance feedback and compare this to the pseudo-relevance feedback. Our results indicate that one can compensate large amounts of relevant but low quality feedback by small amounts of highly relevant feedback. 1...|$|E

40|$|Reliability, {{validity}} and standardization are well-established principles {{in most areas}} of psychometrics, but are rarely mentioned in performance assessment within human psychopharmacology. Test reliability and standardization are examined here, while validity is covered in two succeeding articles. The undocumented reliability of human psychopharmacology performance tests makes the interpretation of findings difficult and ambiguous. Reliability, or consistency within and between test sessions is, however, easy to calculate. Several procedures for calculating reliability are described, with test-retest reliability recommended as the most appropriate single summary measure. Poor test standardization is another major problem, with many research groups using different tests. The extent of this problem is examined, {{and a set of}} standardization requirements proposed. They could comprise the basis for test manuals. The problems of undocumented reliability and unstandardized tests have been recognized within the field for many years, yet no moves have been made to remedy the situation.
