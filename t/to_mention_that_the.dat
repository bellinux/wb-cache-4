5|$|She often {{bears the}} brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and {{in part due to}} her aloof nature. One such {{occasion}} saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn £500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.|$|E
5|$|The film {{continues}} to be appreciated for its experimental nature, its camera angles and montage elements being treated in an unusual manner, while the fiction elements of the screenplay hint of magic realism. In this sense, it is important <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> days in the film are separated by Andrei's erotic dreams. In his dreams, the differences between him and Marilena are partially removed, either by lowering the rooftop on which the boy stands to ground level or by debarking the girl from a breast-shaped UFO that scares the neighbors away. Another fictional element is Marilena's capacity of provoking short circuits, in moments in which she is very emotionally active (e.g., when Andrei touches her in the bar's restroom, or when the whole neighborhood is cut from electricity when she cries near the high voltage electrical box).|$|E
25|$|The {{television}} network was also criticized for allegedly biased coverage {{of events in}} the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, including the Bat Mitzvah massacre in 2002, where the network failed to note that the massacre victims were attending a bat mitzvah celebration for a 12-year-old girl, and neglected <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gunman crashed the event at a crowded banquet hall. When the Palestinian militant Raed Karmi was killed by the Israeli army, Al Jazeera was criticized for failing to mention Israeli accusations about how many people he had killed, which would have provided a context for the story.|$|E

25|$|Kept at {{the city}} morgue, the body was {{assigned}} to Urmuz's brother-in-law and fellow clerk C. Stoicescu, who stated that the writer had been suffering from neurosis. Urmuz was buried on November 26, in his family plot at Bellu cemetery.

Yet, it was the nearby hermitage of Nossa Senhora do Rosário that functioned as the parochial church of Lagoa, suggesting that Santa Cruz was under construction or remodelling. On 3 January 1692, vicar Salvador de Sousa suggested constructing a clock for the church, and during the 1844 remodelling, the frontispiece and tower were extended to make way for such a project.|$|E
500|$|Once Hershiser {{achieved}} {{his second}} consecutive complete-game shutout to reach 22 consecutive scoreless innings, he was lauded for his 20th {{win in the}} national press while the local press praised his serious contention for the Cy Young Award, given to the league's best pitcher. The 20th win had been his preseason goal. His third consecutive complete-game shutout, which brought him to 31 consecutive innings, was said in local newspapers to have strengthened his Cy Young Award chances and in national newspapers to have helped his team in the pennant race. There was little emphasis on the historical context of his streak at this point, even among newspapers that headlined the streak. Upon reaching 40 consecutive innings, most of the national media began <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> record was 58 (in some cases [...] ).

Not only did he commented on Royce da 5'9"s verse, [...] "The gritty Detroit MC recalls his own battles to the top, referencing doubters at every turn", but also noticed that the track was [...] "inspirational", addictive and made to be sent to the radio. Magazine XXL commented on the single, saying it is [...] "inspirational" [...] and set to be on heavy rotation during the summer time and [...] "another break from the typical vicious lyrical assault." [...] About.com's Bill Lamb gave a generally positive review, awarding the song 4 our of 5 starts, naming it [...] "an engaging, soulful pop hip hop blend", by having humorous lyrics and [...] "Mars' soulful, memorable rap", but went on <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> track [...] "sounds a bit schmaltzy at times."

500|$|The Australian media wrote uniformly glowing {{reports that}} heaped praise on Diệm, and {{generally}} presented {{him as a}} courageous, selfless and wise leader. The Sydney Morning Herald described Diệm as [...] "One {{of the most remarkable}} men in the new Asia ... authoritarian in approach but liberal in principle". The Age compared Diệm favourably to Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee, the Presidents of the Republic of China and South Korea respectively. The trio were the respective leaders of the anti-communist halves of the three countries in Asia that had been divided along communist and anti-communist lines. The Age opined that Diệm was not [...] "morally equivocal" [...] but [...] "incorruptible and intensely patriotic" [...] compared to his anti-communist counterparts, and [...] "the type of Asian leader whose straight talk and courageous manner should be valued". The Canberra Times noted that Diệm's visit coincided with that of Foreign Minister Richard Casey to Malaya for that country's independence celebrations. Australia had supported Malaya's successful fight against communism and the newspaper compared the two countries, predicting that they would succeed because [...] "the leaders owe their authority to popular support". Like the politicians, the press overlooked the negative aspects and reality of Diệm's rule, such as his authoritarianism. Although Diệm was depicted as being extremely popular and democratic, he had made himself president when his brother rigged a 1955 referendum that allowed him to depose Bảo Đại; Diệm was subsequently credited with 133% of the votes in Saigon. Diệm's family regime routinely engaged in corruption, ballot stuffing and arbitrary arrests of all opposition.

Newman also wrote that the song's urban edge manifests Little Mix's growth and development. Gigwise's Andrew Trendell praised the track's production, writing, [...] "The skittering beats and little quirks of [...] 'DNA' make it instantly memorable." [...] Adrian Thrills of the Daily Mail complimented the song's choral middle-eight, deeming it [...] "an inventive sonic flourish". [...] "DNA" [...] was described as [...] "pop perfection" [...] by Lewis Corner of Digital Spy, who highlighted the song's [...] "spooky synths, pumping heartbeats and gothic choir finale".

According to Hackford Jones of music website, Pressparty, [...] "DNA" [...] is [...] "a storming slice of future-pop" [...] and [...] "a vibrant and commanding modern-day pop anthem that has the Little Mix personality stamped all the way through it." [...] Amy Gravelle of Entertainment Wise felt that the song represents the group's [...] "feisty charm". Gravelle also described the track as [...] "an infectiously catchy pop belter that proves the girls {{have what it takes to}} keep up with the best of their rivals." [...] Ciara Moore from The College View said that [...] "DNA" [...] won Little Mix a legion of teenage fans. Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman called the song [...] "bludgeoning, booming techno pop". 4Music's Trent Maynard said that [...] "DNA" [...] is a [...] "much darker turn for the cheery foursome, but just as catchy and polished as their previous single." [...] The song was described as [...] "an absolute gem" [...] by Lizzie Cox of Sugar. Rick Fulton of the Daily Record positively reviewed the song, awarding it three out of five stars. Fulton deemed the song as [...] "feisty electro fun" [...] and [...] "a bit harder than 'Wings'". He also added, [...] "it seems Little Mix have big aspirations to be around for a lot longer than most of 's winners." [...] Nicky Diaz of The Miami Hurricane said that [...] "DNA" [...] shows the group's edgier side.
