5|$|In 2008, {{two more}} fire mishaps {{occurred}} in <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> {{industries in the}} area, one {{in the month of}} March and the other in June: a total of nine people got injured in these two incidents. Even though fire safety licenses and insurances for the workers of <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> factories were made mandatory after the fire incident of 2006, none of the authorities—the municipal corporation, the services department of the state government, and the police—ensured that these were actually followed by the factories. The local residents claimed that the owner of the factory that was impacted in the fire incident of 2006, now operates from another address of the same area. According to fire brigade officials, the Topsia area along with nearby Tiljala and Tangra forms the most fire-prone area of the city, and that around three to four fires break out every week, though they do not get reported in the media as there is no loss of life.|$|E

ABSTRACT: Leather tanning with vegetative materials {{is one of the}} artisanal preoccupations of some craftsmen in the Upper East Region of Ghana. <b>The</b> <b>leathers</b> produced are however, limited to only three colours; brown, white and black. Their usage in multi-coloured applications by <b>leather</b> crafters in <b>the</b> region is therefore very much restricted. Some of the artisans therefore import leathers from other leather producing communities outside Ghana to supplement the local ones. This stifles the growth of the industry and robs the region and the country of the much needed foreign exchange. This experimental research therefore explored the use of basic dyes, which are cheap and readily available in the area, to extend the colour range of <b>the</b> vegetable tanned <b>leathers</b> manufactured in <b>the</b> region. The research showed that even though <b>the</b> dyed <b>leathers</b> were quite fugitive when exposed to extreme sunlight; and were not dyed-through thoroughly, the affinity of the dyes to the grain and flesh sides of <b>the</b> <b>leathers</b> were admirable. <b>The</b> <b>leathers</b> also exhibited excellent colour brilliance, softness and flexibility. It was found out that <b>the</b> dyed <b>leathers</b> could be suitably used in crafting utilitarian articles such as hand bags...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The unique {{physical}} properties of leather make it ideally {{suited for the}} manufacture {{of a variety of}} products. Retanning has important effects on the mechanical and {{physical properties}} of <b>the</b> resultant <b>leather.</b> In this paper, a novel amphoteric acrylic copolymer as retanning material was prepared by free radical copolymerization. The effects of this copolymer on the physical properties of <b>the</b> resultant <b>leather</b> have been investigated by measuring physical and mechanical indexes of <b>the</b> retanned <b>leather.</b> <b>The</b> function mechanism of this copolymer was also researched. Results showed that this copolymer could improve the properties of <b>the</b> resultant <b>leather</b> including softness and strength, and increase leather’s dyeability in contrast to anionic acrylic polymer...|$|R

5|$|Shoe polish may be {{purchased}} pre-soaked into a hard sponge, {{which can be}} used to buff leather without needing to apply any additional polish to either <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> or the sponge. This is usually known as an applicator. A number of companies that manufacture shoe care products also sell a liquid shoe polish in a squeezable plastic bottle, with a small sponge applicator at the end. To decrease its viscosity, bottled polish usually has a very low wax content.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} a relief company, from the 1st Battalion of the Kumaon Regiment, reached Badgam, the {{position}} held by Sharma's company had been overrun. However, the 200 casualties suffered by the tribal infiltrators caused them to lose the impetus to advance. This bought time for Indian forces to fly into Srinagar airfield and block all routes of ingress to Srinagar itself. During the battle, along with Sharma, one junior commissioned officer and 20 other ranks of D company were killed. Sharma's body was recovered three days later.

40|$|Product {{variability}} of manufactured leather goods such as garment leathers could be {{closely related to}} the wear comfort because each material forming the garments are affected the comfort properties of the products. Considering the significant demand to elastic woven stretch fabrics and the advantages provided to leather goods like allowing easy body movements, well-fitting and keeping the shape make the use of stretch fabrics focus in interest. In this study, the performance properties of stretch leathers, leathers and spandex fabrics were presented and the differences between the characteristic properties of <b>the</b> <b>leathers</b> were described. For this purpose, physical characteristics of leathers were investigated in terms of thickness, weight, drape ability, stiffness, bending stiffness, air and water vapor permeability. The drape ability, stiffness and bending stiffness properties were significantly affected by the stretch fabrics laminated on the suede side of <b>the</b> <b>leathers.</b> <b>The</b> drape ability, stiffness and bending values were increased due to the implementation of stretch fabrics. There {{was no significant difference between}} the air permeability values of <b>the</b> <b>leathers</b> prior and after the implementation of stretch fabrics in contrast to water vapor permeability. The results of this study showed that the aesthetic behavior of clothing materials such as drape and stiffness properties as well as water vapor permeability was mainly affected from the implementation of the stretch fabrics...|$|R
50|$|Often {{mistaken for}} inlays, onlays are thin pieces of leather (often less than 0.2 mm) which are adhered over <b>the</b> {{covering}} <b>leather</b> on a book.

On 26 September 1878 he married his first wife, Helene Förster-Peters. From 1877 to 1887 he wrote for the nationalist magazines Neue Welt ("New World"), Heimat ("Homeland"), Deutsche Zeitung ("German Newspaper"), and the Neue Deutsche Alpenzeitung ("New German Alpine Newspaper"), with his articles being devoted to the Austrian countryside and the folk customs of its inhabitants. His interpretations emphasised what he believed were the pagan origins of Austrian place-names, customs, and legends, describing the landscape as being embodied by genius loci, and expressing clear German nationalist and völkisch sentiment.|$|E
5|$|Other early leather {{preserving}} products {{included the}} Irish brand Punch, which was first made in 1851. In 1889, an English {{man by the}} name of William Edward Wren, started making shoe polishes and dubbin under the brand name Wren's. In just 3 years, he won the “First in the Field – First Award Leather Trades Exhibition 1892″ award which was awarded by <b>the</b> <b>Leather</b> Trades Exhibition held in Northampton, the centre of Britain’s boot making industry. This signified the importance and prestige of the exhibition in the trade and was a recognition of Wren's quality. In 1890 the Kroner Brothers established EOS, a shoe polish factory in Berlin, which serviced the Prussian military. It finally closed in 1934 when the Nazis forbade Jews to operate a business. The German brand, Erdal, went on sale in 1901.|$|E
5|$|While {{designed}} for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical.

5|$|By {{the age of}} 22, Evans {{moved out}} of wheel-making and became a {{specialist}} in forming the fine wire used in textile cards, which were used to comb fibers {{in preparation for the}} spinning process to make thread or yarn. A desire to increase the efficiency of this process led him to his first invention—a machine which would bend wire into teeth and cut them off rapidly to aid the assembly of cards. George Latimer, then a justice of the peace in Newport, saw its potential and tasked a blacksmith with creating the machine, which became one of Evans's early successes when it was introduced in 1778. Evans wished to go further in mechanizing the production of textile cards by developing a machine which could puncture <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> into which the wire teeth were inserted. His invention greatly speeded the card manufacturing process, producing around 1,500 teeth every minute, though Evans himself was unable to find financial backing to commercialize his invention. Nevertheless, {{over the next two decades}} card manufacturing innovations inspired by Evans's led to the development of automated textile card production, then in great demand due to the growth of the Southern cotton industry. Early pioneers of mechanized textile-card production, including Giles Richards and Amos Whittemore, are thought to have borrowed heavily from his original designs.|$|E
5|$|The Crow Green tannery was {{situated}} at the south-west end {{of the town and}} was already in existence in 1816. It had a water-powered bark mill and 47 tan pits at that date. It was owned by the Selwood family for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, who probably purchased it from James Whitby around 1830, and it was often referred to as Selwood's tannery. It suffered from fires in 1831, 1867 and 1958. In 1881 it employed 48 people and over 100 in 1958 (8% of the local workforce at the time). One of the major products of the factory in the nineteenth century was high-quality sole leather, but during the Second World War, only poor-quality hides, such as buffalo, were allocated to the firm. The business was badly damaged by the invention of rubber stick-on shoe soles which reduced the demand for sole leather from shoe repairers. It finally finished operation in 1967 when <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> side of the business was sold to a Yorkshire firm.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} is composed in monochrome, muted colours; predominately blacks, greys and browns. The exceptions are {{the whites of}} his collar and sleeves, the reds in the cushion and the light reflecting on <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> of the arm-chair. In 19th-century art, vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion; male portraiture tended towards muted shades and monochrome. Bertin leans slightly forward, boldly staring at the viewer {{in a manner that}} is both imposing and paternal. He seems engaged, and poised to speak, his body fully towards the viewer and his expression etched with certainty. Influenced by Nicolas Poussin's 1650 Self-Portrait with Allegory of Painting, Ingres minutely details the veins and wrinkles of his face. Bertin is in three-quarter profile, against a gold–brown background lit from the right. He rests on a curved-back mahogany chair, the arms of which reflect light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space.|$|E
