5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>floods</b> receded, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo {{ordered the}} Department of National Defense to utilize all {{resources}} {{to assist the}} people affected by <b>the</b> <b>floods.</b> More than 94,000people stayed at 896shelters after being evacuated due to <b>the</b> <b>floods.</b> The federal government allocated $234million (2.34 billion pesos) in relief, which was smaller than the damage total. Widespread medical teams assisted {{tens of thousands of}} homes, and due to prevention measures, there were no outbreaks of diseases. Roads and electrical systems were gradually restored, and students returned to school after repairs were made. Residents throughout Mexico sent supplies to the Mexican Red Cross, including 500tons of food and water, and international agencies sent money and supplies to the flood victims.|$|E

5|$|In Belize, the {{rainfall}} in {{one week}} represented the average monthly values at some stations. Heavy rainfall from the depression caused levels to rise along rivers and creeks. A bridge that had been rebuilt following earlier Tropical Storm Arthur was flooded, prompting the Belize Defence Force to assist in crossings. This isolated much of Cayo District {{from the rest of}} the country until the bridge was repaired. On the western portion of the district, flooding along the Macal River damaged a bridge crossing into northern Guatemala, which restricted traffic only to people returning home. Levels along the Macal and the Belize River were higher than <b>the</b> <b>floods</b> of Hurricane Mitch in 1998, but less than that of Hurricane Keith in 2000. <b>The</b> <b>floods</b> caused residents to evacuate after over 1,000homes were flooded; 311people stayed in shelters, while the remainder stayed with families and relatives. Of the affected houses, 12 were destroyed and 802 were severely damaged. Most of the affected population was in rural areas of western Belize. One village in Orange Walk District had to be quarantined due to the health threat from <b>the</b> <b>floods</b> for 25days. Many roads were closed, and there were widespread school closures. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>floods</b> killed two people in the country and caused BZ$54.1million (BZD, $27.1million USD) in damage. Most of the damage was agricultural, accounting for BZ$28.2million (BZD, $14.1million USD), or 25% of the country's agricultural gross domestic product. Other damage included BZ$11.7million (BZD, $6.3million USD) to roads and bridges.

5|$|In {{response}} to the Taiwan flooding in Kaohsiung, officials deployed 7,888troops to the southern portion of the island to assist in rescue and recovery work. Soldiers also set up five medical centers, and utilized amphibious vehicles to rescue people in flooded areas. Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou toured the flooded regions on September23, emphasizing that efforts to drain the flooding should be the main priority. More than 100buildings in Kaohsiung required water pumps and thousands of volunteers to remove standing water from basements and streets. The mayor Kiku Chen temporarily suspended her reelection campaign due to <b>the</b> <b>floods.</b> About 80% of the factories in Kaohsiung were reopened by September21. The high crop damage allowed farmers to qualify for low interest loans. Rail lines took two weeks to reopen due to damage. Power and water service was restored {{within days of the}} storm, although residents in flooded areas were advised to boil water before usage. There was also an increase in dengue fever after <b>the</b> <b>floods.</b> The Red Cross Society of China donated about US$100,000 {{in the days after the}} storm.

The NWS also implemented increased flood prediction techniques across West Virginia in the years after <b>the</b> <b>floods.</b> As many West Virginia counties lacked a full-time emergency management director at the time, funding from the NWS provided 24‑hour weather radios for every county by the year 1987.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLlanos de Moxos are vast plains in the Bolivian Amazonia {{that are}} {{continually}} <b>flooded</b> by <b>the</b> Mamore river. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> lasts {{for several days}} affecting important cities like Trinidad, drowning people, drowning cattle and swamping arable land. Because of the cloudy skies, remote sensing observations are limited to some areas and few days. Thus, there is huge uncertainty about characteristics of flood events and possible consequences. Two-dimensional (2 D) numerical simulation {{proved to be an}} important tool for understanding <b>flood</b> events. <b>The</b> HEC-RAS model {{is one of the most}} popular hydraulic models. In 2014 a new version of HEC-RAS (HEC-RAS-v 5) was released including 2 D capabilities. The present study applied the new HEC-RAS-v 5 to simulate <b>the</b> February 2014 <b>flood</b> event in <b>the</b> Bolivian Amazonia. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> simulated shows good performance when compared with satellite image of <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> event. In addition, the simulation provides information like water depth, flow velocity and a temporal variation of <b>the</b> <b>flood.</b> Specific locations where water begins to overflow were identified. Over most of <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> area <b>the</b> water velocity is lower than 0. 25 ms− 1. During first ten days of <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> extent increases rapidly. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> depth allows identifying areas exposed to different hazard levels. The west plain of the Mamore river is the most exposed to the flood; it shows bigger flood extent, longer flood duration and deeper water depth. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> that threatens <b>the</b> city of Trinidad originates in two locations; one located 32 km at the north and other located 10 km at the south west. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> from <b>the</b> north gets close to Trinidad twelve days after it begins to overflow, while <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> from <b>the</b> south gets close to Trinidad seven days after it begins to overflow. Although <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> from <b>the</b> north is deeper than <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> from <b>the</b> south, <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> from <b>the</b> south begins <b>flooded</b> before <b>the</b> north. Thus, water borne and vector borne diseases may originate at the south earlier than the north. The city of San Javier gets covered by flood five days after the water begins to overflow. The study shows the applicability and the value of the 2 D capabilities of the new HEC-RAS for flood studies...|$|R
