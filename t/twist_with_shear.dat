40|$|We {{study the}} class of vacuum (Ricci flat) six-dimensional spacetimes admitting a {{non-degenerate}} multiple Weyl aligned null direction l, thus being of Weyl type II or more special. Subject to an additional assumption on the asymptotic fall-off of the Weyl tensor, we prove that these spacetimes can be completely classified {{in terms of the}} two eigenvalues of the (asymptotic) twist matrix of l and of a discrete parameter U^ 0 =± 1 / 2, 0. All solutions turn out to be Kerr-Schild spacetimes of type D and reduce to a family of "generalized" Myers-Perry metrics (which include limits and analytic continuations of the original Myers-Perry black hole metric, such as certain NUT spacetimes). A special subcase corresponds to <b>twisting</b> solutions <b>with</b> zero <b>shear.</b> In passing, limits connecting various branches of solutions are briefly discussed.

40|$|A unique coordinated {{data set}} {{consisting}} of vector magnetograms, H-alpha photographs, and high-resolution ultraviolet {{images of a}} solar active region is used, together with mathematical models, to calculate potential and force-free magnetic field lines and to examine the nonpotential nature of the active region structure. It is found that the overall bipolar magnetic field of the active region had a net twist corresponding to net current of order 3 x 10 to the 12 th A and average density of order 4 x 10 to the - 4 th A/sq m flowing antiparallel to the field. There were three regions of enhanced nonpotentiality {{in the interior of}} the active region; in one the field had a marked nonpotential <b>twist</b> or <b>shear</b> <b>with</b> height above the photosphere. The measured total nonpotential magnetic energy stored in the entire active region was of order 10 to the 32 nd ergs, about 3 sigma above the noise level...|$|R
40|$|The {{vibrational}} states {{experienced by}} the active components of a drilling assembly such as that found in the oil or gas industry {{are discussed in the}} context of an integrated mathematical model. The work is motivated by the need to understand the complex vibrational states that such a system can exhibit in order to better control their constructive and destructive potential. The model is expressed in terms of six continuous independent degrees of freedom. Three locate the position of the centroid of the drill-string in space and three permit the dynamical state of the drill-string to be expressed in terms of flexural, torsional and <b>shear</b> strain, together <b>with</b> dilation and stretch. By supplementing the model with appropriate constitutive relations that relate these strains to bending and <b>twisting</b> couples together <b>with</b> <b>shear</b> and compression forces it can fully accommodate the modes of vibration that are traditionally associated with the motion of drill-strings in both straight and curved boreholes discussed in the engineering literature. These include axial motion along the length of the drill-string, torsional or rotational motion and transverse or lateral motion. Attention is given to the boundary conditions appropriate for an active drill-string and BHA stabiliser including an account of frictional simulations at the rock-interface, cutter simulations for different types of drill-bit and interactions between the bore cavity and the drill-string. The model is used to discuss the stability of axisymmetric drill-string configurations in vertical boreholes under both coupled torsional, axial and lateral perturbations as well as general non-perturbative coupled vibrational states under extreme conditions of lateral whirl...|$|R
