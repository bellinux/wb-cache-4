50|$|Resorcylic acid lactones are a {{group of}} estrogenic compounds. They are lactones of resorcylic acid. Examples include the mycoestrogens (and {{synthetic}} analogues) zearalenone, zearalanone, zeranol (α-zearalanol), <b>taleranol</b> (β-zearalanol), α-zearalenol, and β-zearalenol.|$|E
50|$|<b>Taleranol</b> (INN, USAN) (developmental {{code name}} P-1560), or teranol, {{also known as}} β-zearalanol, is a synthetic, nonsteroidal {{estrogen}} of the resorcylic acid lactone group related to mycoestrogens found in Fusarium spp which was never marketed. It is the β epimer of zeranol (α-zearalanol) and is a major metabolite of zeranol but with less biological activity.|$|E
40|$|An EU project, FAIR 5 -CT- 1997 - 3443, {{has been}} {{undertaken}} to distinguish illegal use of zeranol from consumption of food contaminated with Fusarium spp. toxin. One {{of the tasks}} was development of screening and confirmatory methods of analysis. This paper describes a new method based on two-step clean-up and GC-MS analysis. The first clean-up step is matrix-dependant; the second is applicable to both urine and meat. The MS is operated in negative chemical ionisation mode. The method is quantitative for zeranol and <b>taleranol,</b> alpha- and beta-zearalenol, and zearalenone and qualitative for zearalanone. Validation was performed {{according to the latest}} EU performance criteria (Commission Decision 2002 / 657). For analysis of urine CC(alpha) and CC(beta) for the method (microg L(- 1)) were 0. 06 - 0. 11 for zeranol, 0. 07 - 0. 12 for <b>taleranol,</b> 0. 07 - 0. 11 for alpha-zearalenol, 0. 21 - 0. 36 for beta-zearalenol, 0. 35 - 0. 60 for zearalenone, and 0. 19 - 0. 33 zearalanone. Within-laboratory reproducibility was 16. 2, 11. 2, 31. 9, 30. 1, 26. 6, and 54. 2 % for zeranol, <b>taleranol,</b> alpha-zearalenol, beta-zearalenol, zearalenone, and zearalanone, respectively. It was found that all the compounds are stable in urine at - 20 degrees C for at least a year. Part of the validation program was organisation of a small proficiency study (ringtest) and a correlation study with an LC-MS-MS method developed by the Veterinary Science Division (VSD; Belfast, UK-NI). This study showed there was good correlation between results from both laboratories. The method can be used for quantitative analysis discriminating illegal use of zeranol from consumption of zearalenone-contaminated food...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} procedure that enables routine analysis for trace determination of six anabolic macrocyclic lactones (zearalenone, alpha and beta -zearalenol, zearalanone, zeranol, and <b>taleranol)</b> in {{sewage treatment plant}} (STP) samples has been developed. The method uses solid-phase extraction, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography with on-line tandem mass spectrometry using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (LC/APCI-MS/MS). The extraction of these compounds from filtered water samples was performed off-line with Gs solid-phase cartridges. The detection was achieved by isocratic reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with an heated nebulizer (HN) APCI interface operating in negative ion mode. Mean recovery of the analytes in STP effluent samples generally exceeded 81 %. This method {{was used to determine}} the occurrence of target analytes in the aquatic environment. In the selected STP effluent samples, zearalenone and alpha -zearalenol were detected in the ng/L range...|$|E
40|$|The resorcylic acid lactones {{zearalenone}} (1), α-zearalenol (2), β-zearalenol (3), α-zearalanol (zeranol) (4), β-zearalanol (<b>taleranol)</b> (5), and zearalanone (6) {{were converted}} to their glucuronides on a preparative scale in good yields. Reactions were conducted with bovine uridine 5 ′-diphosphoglucuronyl transferase (UDPGT) as catalyst and uridine 5 ′-diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA) as cofactor. The glucuronides were isolated by column chromatography and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Although the principal products were 4 -O-glucuronides (i. e., linkage through a phenolic hydroxyl), significant quantities of the 6 ′-O-glucuronides (i. e., linkage through the aliphatic hydroxyl) of alcohols 2, 4, and 5 were also isolated. In the case of 3, the 2 -O-glucuronide was isolated as the minor product. Overall isolated yields of glucuronides, performed on a 20 − 50 mg scale, were typically ca. 80 % based on the resorcylic acid lactone starting material. LC-UV-MS 2 analysis of purified specimens revealed MS 2 fragmentations useful for defining the point of attachment of the glucuronide moiety to the zearalenone nucleus...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of the banned anabolic substance zeranol and the metabolites <b>taleranol</b> and zearalanone in bovine urine {{is complicated by the}} occurrence of the structurally-related mycotoxin zearalenone and the corresponding - and -zearalenol metabolites which possess similar estrogenic properties. A liquid chromatography-negative ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometric method is presented for the confirmatory analysis of all six resorcylic acid lactones ("zeranols") in urine samples using deuterium-labelled internal standards. The method was validated as a confirmatory method for bovine urine samples according to new draft EU guidelines and showed good precision and linearity, and CC and CC values of 0. 02 – 0. 30 and < 1. 0 ng ml- 1, respectively. The applicability was demonstrated by comparing the results of an incurred sample with previous results on the same sample obtained by gas chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry. Preliminary data show that following a simple matrix solid phase dispersion clean-up, liver samples from poultry will be amenable to this method as well...|$|E
40|$|Zearalenone is an {{oestrogenic}} mycotoxin {{which has}} the potential to cause reproductive disorders in sheep. Zearalenone-producing Fusarium species are present in New Zealand pasture and {{it is likely that the}} amount of zearalenone present during the mating period may be sufficient to cause reproductive dysfunction in the grazing sheep. This study consisted of three trials which aimed to measure zearalenone levels in the pasture and sheep, and determine the subsequent effects on reproductive performance. The first trial investigated the levels of zearalenone during April in various components of the ryegrass plant at various pasture sites, which included urine-patch, dung-patch and inter-excreta sites. Zearalenone taken up by the ryegrass plant was also determined. The second trial comprised of 6 groups of ewes (n= 10), and compared levels of zearalenone and related metabolites in the blood and urine of ewes grazed on pasture or chicory and either orally (5 mg/ewe) or intravenously dosed (2 or 0. 5 mg/ewe) daily with zearalenone. The subsequent effects on ovulation rate, conception rate, and number of lambs carried was also determined. The third trial comprised of 4 groups (n= 110) of ewes, of which two groups were grazed on grass-dominant pasture and the remaining 2 groups were grazed on chicory for two weeks prior to mating at which time one of the groups on each grazing treatment was interchanged and the ram introduced. The levels of free and conjugated zearalenone in the blood and urine were determined and the subsequent effects on ovulation rate, conception rate and the number of lambs carried were measured. In the first trial it was shown that zearalenone concentration within sites was highly variable at that time of the year, however, urine-patch and dung patch sites yielded significantly higher quantities of zearalenone. Zearalenone appeared to be readily taken up by the ryegrass plant through the roots and translocated into the young growing tissue of the plant. The distribution of zearalenone in the pasture and the plant are discussed with regards to zearalenone intake by the animal. The zearalenone dosing trial showed that significant levels of zearalenone, α-and α-zearalenol, zeranol and <b>taleranol</b> were present in the blood and urine of dosed ewes and that levels of all compounds analysed were higher in ewes grazed on pasture. Ewes grazing pasture had a significantly lower (P< 0. 05) ovulation rate than ewes grazed on chicory. The third trial showed that chicory was effective in reducing the levels of free zearalenone present in the ewe around the time of mating with levels in ewes grazed on chicory being significantly lower (P< 0. 05) in both the urine and blood, than in ewes grazed on grass pasture. There were no significant differences in reproductive performance. Zearalenone levels in the pasture were generally lower in 1995 than in previous years and might have reduced possible differences in reproductive performance between ewes on the different feed types. The implications of higher zearalenone concentrations in the pasture are discussed with regards to reproductive performance and the use of chicory as a feed prior to mating. Further research is required to identify and clarify links with zearalenone and metabolites produced in pasture and reproductive dysfunction in ewes...|$|E
