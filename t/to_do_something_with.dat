5|$|For {{eight years}} after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged—in the center of Philadelphia's {{business}} district. The building was caught in litigation between the owners and the insurance company over how much the insurers would pay the owners and how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the owners <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>with</b> the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998. At {{the time of its}} demolition in 1999, One Meridian Plaza was the third-tallest destroyed building in the world.|$|E

In February 2008, {{it was reported that}} All Time Low had collaborated on a song with Mark Hoppus of Blink-182/+44. The band connected with Hoppus after exchanging emails when a video of drummer Rian Dawson getting a Blink-182 tattoo was posted online.

25|$|Early {{correspondence}} {{shows that}} he always liked school, and was always seeking meaning—seeking <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>with</b> his life. In 1876, he {{had the chance to}} attend high school in Columbus, Wisconsin, which had opened that year. Like many youth, he struggled with what to do with his life. After attending a year of high school, he began to teach at a Hampden school, while continuing his studies. In 1879, he attended college at the Oshkosh Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh). He left there after only one year due to financial reasons, and took a job teaching in Columbus, Wisconsin. He hoped to earn enough money to go back to college.|$|E
25|$|The {{park was}} created in 1978 when Great American Recreation (GAR), the new owners of the {{recently}} combined Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>with</b> the ski area during the off season. Two years earlier, in 1976, they had followed the trend of many other ski areas {{at the time and}} opened a -long alpine slide down very steep ski trails. Gradually, Waterworld and Motorworld came together {{at the base of the}} mountain to form one of North America's earliest modern water parks, which was originally called the Vernon Valley Summer Park. They started out with two water slides and a LOLA race car track in the summer of 1978, and then more waterslides and a small deep-water swimming pool the next year, as well as tennis courts and a softball field. Finally, Motorworld was carved out of the swampy areas the ski area owned across Route 94. Ultimately, the small park consisting of the alpine slide and two water slides evolved to a major destination with 75 rides (35 motorized, self-controlled rides and 40 water slides).|$|E

One day, after being {{rejected}} by the citizens of Ritardando, because average people think the magic disease is contagious, she decides that she wants <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>with</b> her life before it ends. The initial party wants to find out why the mineral powder is so cheap compared to the floral powder and to stop the mining of Mt. Rock to acquire it because the mining damages Agogo Forest. As they progress, the party learns that the mineral powder has fatal side effects that would aid Forte's insurrection against its enemy, Baroque. Realising this, the party heads for Forte, but are stopped and taken into the Forte dungeon because Forte was alerted to the planned arrival of the rebellion group, Andantino. Shortly after escaping, the party unites with Andantino and are spotted by the same Forte personnel south of Fort Fermata (which is a short walk from Forte), and fall off a bridge into a river. Half of the party, along with Andantino, go through poisonous swamps to Andante, the hideout of Andantino. The other half of the party were saved by Prince Crescendo of Baroque, with his ship. They encounter pirates and defeat them shortly thereafter. After getting safely into Baroque, the party discuss the situation. Forte is threatening a war, but Baroque wants peace. Crescendo thinks of the plan to assassinate Count Waltz of Forte, but the plan is quickly discarded.|$|E

Guillory was pleased to have played a more innocent character, saying [...] "I've played floozies, psychopaths, assassins, crackheads...

Evancho said in 2012: [...] "I don't think I want to act full-time.

The notion of combining these two great passions in my life—cars and animation—was irresistible. When Joe (Ranft) and I first started talking about this film in 1998, we knew we wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>with</b> cars as characters. Around that same time, we watched a documentary called 'Divided Highways,' which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed. That's when we started really researching Route 66, but we still hadn't quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when we visited our family in St. Louis." ...|$|E
500|$|Extraterrestrials {{make their}} first {{appearance}} in this episode, as Carter {{thought it would be}} a good moment to reveal them. The image of the alien was stretched in post-production to make it look taller and skinnier. The writers for the episode researched various abductee reports and conspiracy theories in order to get the right feel for the episode and make the aliens appear realistic and not [...] "fanciful". The episode makes several mentions to the Voyager program and the Voyager Golden Record; Mulder and Senator Matheson listen to Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 in F. First Movement while in the latter's office. The concerto's first movement is the first piece of music on the Voyager record. In addition, the episode relies heavily on mentions of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program, the collective name for a number of activities people undertake to search for intelligent extraterrestrial life. Morgan later explained, “I always wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>with</b> the SETI background. Hope that kids at school check out SETI, because it was factual as to what exists.” ...|$|E

She further explained:When I wrote [...] "Alfie", nobody really knew who I was. At first he was really upset about it, because he thought that I was just pointing out all of his bad points and attacking him. I thought it was really flattering [...] I thought he'd be really, really happy because it proved to him how much I loved him, that I care about him, and I want him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>with</b> his life.

[...] "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" [...] marks the second time Sanz and Shakira collaborated after [...] "La Tortura", included on the latter's Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 (2005). Sanz stated, [...] "I hadn't dared ask her if she wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>with</b> me, because it was a little like, 'I sing with you, now sing with me'. Plus, we didn't want it to be 'La Tortura 2' because we're very considerate of each other. She's the one who came and said, 'Hey, I want to sing'."

Joining forces with Fall Out Boy, one of the most dynamic rock bands in the industry, will be an exciting and historic event for rock and hip-hop." [...] Due to the conflicting fan opinion regarding the album, concertgoers would [...] "boo the band for performing numbers from the record in concert", leaving Stump to describe touring in support of Folie as like [...] "being the last act at the vaudeville show: We were rotten vegetable targets in Clandestine hoods." [...] "Some of us were miserable onstage," [...] said Trohman. [...] "Others were just drunk." ...|$|E

He based protagonist Alex Parrish, whose complex family history haunts her throughout the series, on a relative; Safran wove his own struggle to understand that family member into Alex's desire to learn the truth about her father. Safran said [...] "I have a family member who either is a pathological liar or {{has been involved with}} a government agency my whole life. I've always struggled with knowing that I would never know the truth, because there is no real such thing as the truth with regard to somebody {{who may or may not}} be telling the truth.
