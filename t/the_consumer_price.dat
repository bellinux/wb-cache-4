5|$|On {{taking office}} as Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown gave the Bank of England {{operational}} independence in monetary policy, and thus responsibility for setting interest rates through the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee. At {{the same time}} he also changed the inflation measure from the Retail Price Index to <b>the</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Price</b> Index and transferred responsibility for banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority. Some commentators have argued that this division of responsibilities exacerbated the severity in Britain of the 2007 global banking crisis.|$|E

40|$|Marketing {{information}} {{is used by}} financial and insurance institutions, business enterprises and companies for planning, control, monitoring and forecasting purposes in business. One {{of the problems is}} the detection and investigation of factors, which influence <b>the</b> behavior of <b>consumers.</b> Such a basic factor is, for instance, <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>prices</b> index. <b>The</b> significance of this factor periodically changes and depends on the values of main indexes of economy such as export, import, taxes, labor force, unemployment, inflation level, etc., and also on <b>the</b> behavior of <b>consumers,</b> their taste, living standard and style. For the marketing research of this dependence it is necessary to construct mathematical models of <b>the</b> evolution of <b>consumer</b> <b>prices.</b> In <b>the</b> paper, a new auto regression model with disturbances is constructed for <b>consumer</b> <b>prices.</b> <b>The</b> model includes monetary aggregate amount and control function. A new formula is derived for the solution of an equation for <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>prices</b> index, which can be used in forecasting the inflation process. Using the data on <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>prices</b> index in Georgia, a numerical example is given, which illustrates the estimates of the coefficients of the constructed model and the inflation process forecast...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{estimate}} the specific impact of the introduction of the euro on Italian consumer inflation that can be attributed solely to the rounding of prices to figures that are "attractive" in euro. The empirical analysis is based on a large sub-set of prices used by Istat to calculate <b>the</b> general <b>consumer</b> <b>price</b> index for Italy. Between January and October 2002 <b>the</b> general <b>consumer</b> <b>price</b> index rose 2. 4 %; the impact of rounding on <b>the</b> general <b>consumer</b> <b>price</b> index in Italy amounted to between 0. 3 and 0. 9 percentage points, depending on the method of estimation used. With reference to the average rise in <b>the</b> general <b>consumer</b> <b>price</b> index of 2. 5 % in 2002, the impact on average annual <b>consumer</b> <b>price</b> inflation in 2002 lies between 0. 1 and 0. 5 percentage points.
