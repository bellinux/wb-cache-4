5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of direct election, the new Constitution was seen as such a radical break with the old system, by which delegates were elected to the Confederation Congress by state legislatures, that the Convention agreed to retain this method of electing senators to make the constitutional change less radical. The more difficult problem was the issue of apportionment. The Connecticut delegation offered a compromise, whereby the number of representatives for each state in the lower house would be apportioned based on the relative size of the state's population, {{while the number of}} representatives in the upper house would be the same for all of the states, irrespective of size. The large states, fearing a diminution of their influence in the legislature under this plan, opposed this proposal. Unable to reach agreement, the delegates decided to leave <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>for</b> further consideration later during the meeting.|$|E

25|$|Talc can {{sometimes}} be contaminated with asbestos due to the proximity of asbestos ore (usually tremolite) in underground talc deposits. By 1973, US federal law required all talc products to be asbestos-free, and today there is strict quality control {{in the production of}} talc products, separating cosmetic-grade talc (e.g. talcum powder) from industrial-grade talc (often used in friction products) has largely eliminated <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>for</b> consumers.|$|E

25|$|The bewildering {{number and}} variety of phonetic values that signs could have in Sumerian led to an unfortunate detour in {{understanding}} the language – a Paris-based orientalist, Joseph Halévy, argued from 1874 onward that Sumerian was not a natural language, but rather a secret code (a cryptolect), and {{for over a decade}} the leading Assyriologists battled over <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b> <b>For</b> a dozen years, starting in 1885, even the great Friedrich Delitzsch accepted Halévy's arguments, not renouncing Halévy until 1897.|$|E
25|$|Most surveys {{indicate}} that while blacks tend to vote Democratic in elections, members of traditionally African-American churches {{are generally more}} socially conservative than white Protestants as a whole.

Also it is mentioned in Mu'jam Al-Buldan of Yaqut al-Hamawi, Tafsir al-Kabir of Imam Fakhru'd-din Razi, Sawa'iq al-Muhriqa of Ibn Hajar p.21, Sharh al-Nahju'l-Balagha of Ibn Abi'l-Hadid Mu'tazali Vol 4, p.80 that Fatima firstly claimed she was given the fadak as a gift but they rejected her witnesses and she suffered and angrily said that she would not talk to Abu Bakr and Umar again.|$|E

25|$|A {{flat tax}} system and income taxes overall are not {{inherently}} border-adjustable; meaning the tax component embedded into products via taxes imposed on companies (including corporate taxes and payroll taxes) are not removed when exported {{to a foreign}} country (see Effect of taxes and subsidies on price). Taxation systems such as a sales tax or value added tax can remove the tax component when goods are exported and apply the tax component on imports. The domestic products could be at a disadvantage to foreign products (at home and abroad) that are border-adjustable, which would impact the global competitiveness of a country. However, it's possible that a flat tax system could be combined with tariffs and credits to act as border adjustments (the proposed Border Tax Equity Act in the U.S. attempts this). Implementing an income tax with a border adjustment tax credit {{is a violation of}} the World Trade Organization agreement. Tax exemptions (allowances) on low income wages, a component of most income tax systems could mitigate <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>for</b> high labour content industries like textiles that compete Globally.|$|E
25|$|A 3-cent Washington-head coil stamp (Scott 389) {{issued in}} 1911 is {{commonly}} referred to as the Orangeburg coil. It was printed with the flat-plate press on single-line watermarked paper with vertical, gauge 12, perforations. The Post Office produced only a small batch of these stamps (it would soon switch over to gauge 8½ perforations for coils) and apparently sold them all to the Bell Pharmaceutical Company, which used 3¢ coil stamps to send samples of their products to physicians through the mail. The actual quantity issued remains unknown. The earliest known use on cover is dated April 27, 1911. Due to the quantity of mail, they were put through the first-class canceling machine at Orangeburg, New York and were mailed third-class. Because these stamps were used on third class mail, most were eventually discarded. Owing to its limited and specific usage philatelists were at first unaware of <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>for</b> approximately two years and so very few examples were saved and collected in mint condition, which accounts for their rarity of this issue today. Approximately twelve covers have been certified as genuine by the Philatelic Foundation. The Orangeburg coils are the rarest coils of the Washington-Franklin issues.|$|E

500|$|Although the Wii {{version of}} the game was advertised as {{supporting}} Dolby Pro Logic II, players reported that the game would output audio in neither Pro Logic II nor stereo, providing only mono sound.

A class-action lawsuit over the mono sound issue was settled out of court, and Activision agreed to ship free faceplates for the Les Paul guitar controller to those who requested a replacement disc.

2500|$|With {{respect to}} Greek philosophy, {{particularly}} Aristotle, Asín infers that the religio-philosophic world inhabited by Averroës {{is analogous to}} that of Aquinas, and also to that of ben Maimon or Maimonides (1135–1204) the Jewish philosopher and talmudist, also from Córdoba. Asín understood that it was with piety that Averroës used reason to interpret his Islamic faith, and probes <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>for</b> the sake of clearly distinguishing Averroës from several of the not-so-pious Latin [...] "Averroístas". Asín also refers to medieval voluntarism (called asaries in Islam), in order to contrast and distinguish the similar rationalisms held by Averroës and by Aquinas. Yet, many Thomists did not then accept without great controversy Asín's point of view.|$|E

2500|$|Further {{studies with}} a number of {{different}} dive profiles, and also different levels of exertion, would be necessary to fully investigate <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b> <b>For</b> example, there is much better scientific evidence that breathing high-oxygen gases increases exercise tolerance, during aerobic exertion. Though even moderate exertion while breathing from the regulator is a relatively uncommon occurrence in scuba, as divers usually try to minimize it in order to conserve gas, episodes of exertion while regulator-breathing do occasionally occur in sport diving. Examples are surface-swimming a distance to a boat or beach after surfacing, where residual [...] "safety" [...] cylinder gas is often used freely, since the remainder will be wasted anyway when the dive is completed. It is possible that these so-far un-studied situations have contributed to some of the positive reputation of nitrox.|$|E
