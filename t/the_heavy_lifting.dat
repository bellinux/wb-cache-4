5|$|The 1950–51 Ashes {{series was}} Australia's first home series in three years. In the opening match {{of the season}} for Victoria against the touring Englishmen, Johnston warmed up by scoring 30 and taking a total of 3/89, {{including}} the wickets of leading batsmen Compton and Hutton. In the First Test at Brisbane, England were caught on a sticky wicket and Johnston took 5/35, removing Reg Simpson, Washbrook, Evans, Compton and Arthur McIntyre, as England declared at 7/68. He then took 2/30 in the second innings, removing Evans and Compton {{for a second time}} as Australia won the match to take a 1–0 lead. In the Second Test at the MCG, Johnston took 2/28 and 4/26 as Australia scraped home by 28 runs, defending a target of only 179 on a cracked pitch. Johnston had quiet Third Test with only a total of 1/82 in an innings victory, but he returned to form in the Fourth Test in Adelaide with 3/58 and 4/73 in a 274-run win. He did much of <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> in the second innings, removing the top four English batsmen, Hutton, Simpson, Washbrook and Compton. Johnston struggled in the final Test with match figures of 1/91 as England won their only Test of the series. Johnston led the wicket takers list, with 22 at 19.18, as Australia took a 4–1 series triumph. Johnston had saved his best performances for the Tests; he managed only 19 wickets at 40.37 in eight matches for Victoria during the season, and never took more than two wickets in an innings. He was particularly unsuccessful against New South Wales, taking a total of 3/190 in two matches. Overall, he took 41 wickets at 29.00 for the season.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Jennifer Armstrong {{had mixed}} {{feedback}} on the episode, writing: [...] "The all-medical, all-the-time episodes need to stop." [...] However, she found it [...] "fantastic" [...] when Shepherd drew on the wall, and enjoyed Tahir's character, calling him [...] "lovely". Armstrong also said that [...] "Give Peace a Chance" [...] was in [...] "ER territory", adding: [...] "I do not watch Grey's Anatomy to get my ER fix." [...] Adam Bryant of TV Guide enjoyed this episode compared to the previous one, but disliked the possible romantic development between Karev and Adamson. In his review, he concluded that the installment [...] "proves that Meredith Grey doesn't {{have to do all}} <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> on this show".|$|E
500|$|On {{the first}} two days, he bowled thirty (eight ball) overs to take 5/135 in the first innings as the West Indies reached 453. He did much of <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> in {{removing}} four of the West Indies' batsmen, Conrad Hunte, Smith, Kanhai and Worrell. Australia took a small lead of 52 after reaching 505, with Davidson contributing 44. In the second innings, Davidson was left with a heavier workload after his new ball partner Meckiff broke down after four overs. He took 6/87 from 24.6 overs as the West Indies were restricted to 284. he was again responsible for cutting down the leading batsmen, removing Smith, Kanhai, Sobers and Worrell. This left Australia 233runs to win with 312minutes available on the last day. Former Australian Test batsman and journalist Jack Fingleton commented that [...] "One sensed that the West Indies realised they were facing defeat". However, the tourists had other ideas.|$|E

2500|$|Last Train to Paris {{is officially}} {{credited}} to Diddy – Dirty Money. The group was formed when Diddy asked former Danity Kane member, Dawn Richard, and singer-songwriter Kalenna Harper to perform alongside {{him on the}} album. In an interview with All Hip-Hop, Diddy said that Dirty Money is [...] "not about no drug money, illegal money, or anything negative". Instead he described it as [...] "a sound, a movement, [...] a crew", something fresh and unique for his new album. He explained that [...] "he wanted to tell a love story" [...] but needed Dirty Money because [...] "he couldn’t just tell the male’s point of view." [...] Further elaborating on the group's name, Diddy told Slant Magazine that its origins are dated back to 2005 when the group was at [...] "a strip club in Jacksonville, Florida, during the Super Bowl. People heard I was there, {{and all of a}} sudden so many people came in that I had to rush outside to my truck. I was sitting there with a bunch of money and I was like, 'Damn, this is some dirty money.' A light bulb went off that day." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly described the group's role on the album as [...] "fleshing out Last Trains skeletal storyline, playing jealous lovers, disappointed partners, and commanding divas to his conflicted playboy." [...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News said that Dirty Money [...] "sing loudly, often and well -- a good thing", on the disk. [...] Henry Yanney of Soulculture said that Last Train to Paris was vocally-led Harper and Richard, who give the album [...] "attitude and style". He said [...] "the duo sing harmoniously and break into solos with much precision and pace, remaining in sync at all times with the abrasive club influenced beats on hand." [...] David Jeffries said that at times Dirty Money came off as [...] "fine background singers or part of Diddy’s Fashion Week posse." [...] Matt Sayles disagreed, stating that on the record, [...] "Diddy takes a backseat" [...] which allowed [...] "Kaleena and Dawn to do a lot of <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> (and breathing) on a wide range of songs." [...] Dirty Money was inspired by the 1980s bands Soul II Soul and Loose Ends though Diddy pointed out that he [...] "wanted to flip things" [...] by having two girls and one guy in the band. [...] "Two bad divas, one for the left and one for the right side of me". He told Amos Barshad from New York that [...] " [...] diamonds in the rough. These girls got a certain flavor and swagger, which is rare in this marketplace." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the linear {{kinematics}} of the barbell and the angular kinematics of the lower limb during the snatch lifts of two different barbell weights in elite male adolescent weightlifters. In the national team level, nine elite male adolescent weightlifters participated in the study. The snatch lifts were recorded by two video cameras under competitive conditions in preparation period before the European Junior Championship (Sony MiniDv PAL- 50 field/s) and <b>the</b> two <b>heaviest</b> successful <b>lifts</b> were selected for kinematic analysis. The little toe, ankle, knee, hip, and shoulder on the body and one point on the barbell were digitized using Ariel Performance Analysis System (APAS, San Diego, CA, USA). Significant decreases were found in the maximum barbell height, the relative power output during the second pull, and the maximum vertical velocity of the barbell during the second pull of <b>the</b> <b>heaviest</b> <b>lift</b> (p < 0. 05). Maximum extension velocity of the hip joint significantly increased during the first pull of <b>the</b> <b>heaviest</b> <b>lift</b> (p < 0. 05). As the mass of the barbell increased, the maximum vertical velocity and the maximum height of the barbell and relative power output during the second pull decreased in <b>the</b> <b>heaviest</b> <b>lift</b> performed by adolescent weightlifters. Coaches should pay attention to assistant exercises to increase explosive strength during the second pull with maximum strength in male adolescent weightlifters...|$|R
