Recently, robotic insects driven by piezoelectric actuators have achieved the important goal of taking off with external power; however, fully autonomous operation requires an ultralight power supply capable of generating high-voltage drive signals from low-voltage energy sources. This paper describes high-voltage switching circuit topologies and control methods suitable for driving piezoelectric actuators in flapping-wing robotic insects and discusses the physical implementation of these topologies, including the fabrication of custom magnetic components by laser micromachining and other weight minimization techniques.

40|$|International audienceConsuming {{chemical}} energy, {{fuel cells}} produce simultaneously heat, water and useful electrical power [J. M. Andújar, F. Segura, Renew. Sust. Energy Rev., 2309 (2009) ], [J. Larminie, A. Dicks,, 2 nd edn. (John Wiley & Sons, 2003) ]. As {{a matter of}} fact, the voltage generated by a fuel cell strongly depends on both the load power demand and the operating conditions. Besides, {{as a result of}} many design aspects, fuel cells are low voltage and high current electric generators. On the contrary, electric loads are commonly designed for small voltage swing and a high V/I ratio in order to minimize Joule losses. Therefore, electric loads supplied by fuel cells are typically fed by means of an intermediate power voltage regulator. The specifications of such a power converter are to be able to step up the input voltage with a high ratio (a ratio of 10 is a classic situation) and also to work with an excellent efficiency (in order to minimize its size, its weight and its losses) [A. Shahin, B. Huang, J. P. Martin, S. Pierfederici, B. Davat, Energy Conv. Manag., 56 (2010) ]. This paper deals with the design of this essential ancillary device. It intends to bring out the best structure for fulfilling this function. Several dc-dc converters with large voltage step-up ratios are introduced. A topology based on a coupled inductor or <b>tapped</b> <b>inductor</b> is closely studied. A detailed modelling is performed with the purpose of providing designing rules. This model is validated with both simulation and implementation. The experimental prototype is based on the following specifications: the fuel cell output voltage ranges from a 50  V open-voltage to a 25  V rated voltage while the load requires a constant 250  V voltage. The studied coupled inductor converter is compared with a classic boost converter commonly used in this voltage elevating application. Even though the voltage regulator faces severe FC specifications, the measured efficiency reaches 96 % at the rated power whereas conventional boost efficiency barely achieves 91. 5 % in the same operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|Voltage {{boosting}} {{is required}} in many energy conversion applications, ranging from front-end solar energy system to Medium-Voltage DC (MVDC) -grid system, and from headlamp ballast of automobile to fuel cell powered system. This dissertation {{is dedicated to the}} development of voltage boosting technology. New circuits were found both in switched capacitor converters and inductor-based power converters. The former has the potential of full integration while the latter has combined the merits of conventional magnetic components and switched capacitor stages, leading to a new hybrid converter category. These contributions are captured in two major parts respectively: The first part discusses the switched capacitor converters and new discovery in voltage boosting technology as well as modeling technique. The second part introduces a number of new topologies and extensions in hybrid boosting converters. Part I Switched Capacitor Converter (SCC) is a special branch of power electronics converters which is composed of capacitors and switches without the participation of inductors/transformers. It potentially has lower electromagnetic interference (EMI), lighter weight, lower cost, higher energy density, and the promise for full integration. In this part, a family of "Two-switch Boosting Switched-capacitor Converters (TBSC) " is introduced, which distinguishes itself from the prior arts by its symmetrical interleaved operation, reduced output ripple, low yet even voltage stress on components, and systematic expandability. Along with the topologies, a modeling technique based on charge-balance transient-calculation is formulated, which provokes the converter regulation method through duty cycle and frequency adjustment. The design guideline for high efficient TBSC is provided and regulation under high power condition is explored. In addition, an enhanced accurate modeling technique considering the output capacitor effect is developed for simple two-phase SC converters. Part II Built upon the momentum of the "Two-switch Boosting Switched-capacitor Converters (TBSC) " circuit structure, another family of Hybrid Boosting Converters (HBC) is developed, featuring wide regulation range, symmetrical configuration, low component voltage stress, small output voltage ripple, and expandable structure. It integrates the inductive switching cores of various functionalities and control strategies with Bipolar Voltage Multiplier (BVM), resulting in the new breed of hybrid converters: Hybrid Boosting Converters (HBC). The proposed HBC family includes the basic HBC, symmetrical HBC, Isolated HBC, and <b>tapped</b> <b>inductor</b> HBC, all of which are analyzed in details and design considerations are provided. In addition, the 3 D DC-DC converter concept for high power application, inverter configuration and DC micro-grid based on HBC converters are developed. The proposed HBCs are applicable in many areas such HID lamp driver, X-ray system, ion pumps, front-end photovoltaic energy system, and energy storage systems...|$|E
40|$|Boost {{dc-to-dc}} converters {{have very}} good source interface properties. The input inductor makes the source current smooth and hence these converters provide very good EMI performance. On account of this good property, the boost converter is also the preferred converter for off-line UPF rectifiers. One of the issues of concern in these converters is the large size of the storage capacitor on the dc link. The boost converter suffers from the disadvantage of discontinuous current injected to the load. The size of the capacitor is therefore large. Further, the ripple current in the capacitor is {{as much as the}} load current; hence the ESR specification of the tank capacitor is quite demanding. This is specially so in the emerging application areas of automotive power conversion, where the input voltage is low (typically 12 V) and large voltage boost (4 to 5) are desired. The first part of this thesis suggests multi-phase boost converter to overcome the disadvantages of large size storage capacitor in boost converter. Comparison between the specification of single stage and multi-stages is thoroughly examined. Besides the average small signal analysis of N converters in parallel and obtaining an equivalent second order system are discussed. By paralleling the converters the design of closed loop control is a demanding task. To achieve proper current sharing among the stages using current control method is inevitable. Design and implementation of closed loop control of multi-phase boost converter both in analog and digital is the topic of next part of the thesis. Comparison between these two approaches is presented in this part and it will be shown that digital control is more convenient for such a topology on account of the requirement of synchronization, phase shifted operation, current balancing and other desired functions, which will be discussed later in detail. A new direct digital control method, which is simple and fast, is developed. Two different realizations with DSP controller and FPGA controller are considered. In {{the last part of the}} thesis a novel soft switching circuit for boost converter is presented. It provides Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) for the main switch and Zero Current Switching (ZCS) for the auxiliary switch. The paper presents the idealized analysis giving all the circuit intervals and the equations necessary for the design of such a circuit. The proposed soft switching circuit is particularly suited for the tapped-inductor boost circuit with a minimum number of extra components. Extension of the method to <b>tapped</b> <b>inductor</b> boost converter addresses the application of Zero Voltage Transition (ZVT) to high conversion ratio converters. Extension of the method to multiphase boost converter shows that with less number of auxiliary switches soft switching operation can be achieved for all interleaved switching devices. Several laboratory prototype boost converters have been built to confirm the theoretical results and design methods are matching with both simulation and experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Modelling and {{simulation}} {{are essential}} ingredients {{of the analysis}} and design process in power electronics. It helps a design engineer gain an increased understanding of circuit operation. Accordingly, {{for a set of}} specifications given, the designer will choose a particular topology, select component types and values, estimate circuit performance etc. Typically hierarchical modelling, analysis and simulation rather than full detailed simulation of the system provides a crucial insight and understanding. The combination of these insights with hardware prototyping and experiments constitutes a powerful and effective approach to design. Obtaining the mathematical model of the power electronic systems is a major task before any analysis or synthesis or simulation can be performed. There are circuit oriented simulators which uses inbuilt mathematical models for components. Simulation with equation solver needs mathematical models for simulation which are trimmed according to user requirement. There are various methods in the literature to obtain these mathematical models. However, the issues of multi-domain system modelling and causality of the energy variables are not sufficiently addressed. Further, specifically to power converter systems, the issue of switching power models with fixed causality is not addressed. Therefore, our research focuses on obtaining solutions to the above using relatively untouched bond graph method to obtain models for power electronic systems. The power electronic system chosen for the present work is Switched Mode Power Converters (SMPC’s) and in particular PWM DC-DC converters. Bond graph is a labelled and directed graphical representation of physical systems. The basis of bond graph modelling is energy/power flow in a system. As energy or power flow is the underlying principle for bond graph modelling, there is seamless integration across multiple domains. As a consequence, different domains (such as electrical, mechanical, thermal, fluid, magnetic etc.) can be represented in a unified way. The power or the energy flow is represented by a half arrow, which is called the power bond or the energy bond. The causality for each bond is a significant issue that is inherently addressed in bond graph modelling. As every bond involves two power variables, the decision of setting the cause variable and the effect variable is by natural laws. This has a significant bearing in the resulting state equations of the system. Proper assignment of power direction resolves the sign-placing problem when connecting sub-model structures. The causality will dictate whether a specific power variable is a cause or the effect. Using causal bars on either ends of the power bond, graphically indicate the causality for every bond. Once the causality gets assigned, bond graph displays the structure of state space equations explicitly. The first problem we have encountered in modelling power electronic systems with bond graph is power switching. The essential part of any switched power electronic system is a switch. Switching in the power electronic circuits causes change {{in the structure of the}} system. This results in change in dynamic equations of the circuit according to position of the switch. We have proposed the switched power junctions (SPJ) to represent switching phenomena in power electronic systems. The switched power junctions are a generalization of the already existing 0 -junction and 1 -junction concepts of the bond graph element set. The SPJ’s models ideal switching. These elements maintain causality invariance for the whole system for any operational mode of the system. This means that the state vector of the resulting state equation of the system does not change for any operating mode. As SPJs models ideal power switching, the problem of stiff systems and associated numerical stability problems while simulating the system is eliminated. Further, it maintains one to one correspondence with the physical system displaying all the feasible modes of operation at the same time on the same graph. Using these elements, the switched mode power converters (SMPC's) are modelled in bond graph. Bond graph of the converter is the large signal model of the converter. A graphical procedure is proposed that gives the averaged large signal, steady state and small signal ac models. The procedure is suitable for the converters operating in both Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) and in Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM). For modelling in DCM, the concept of virtual switch is used to model the converter using bond graph. Using the proposed method, converters of any complexity can be modelled incorporating all the advantages of bond graph modelling. Magnetic components are essential part of the power electronic systems. Most common parts are the inductor, transformer and coupled inductors which contain both the electric and magnetic domains. Gyrator-Permeance approach is used to model the magnetic components. Gyrator acts as an interface between electric and magnetic domain and capacitor model the permeance of the magnetic circuits. Components like inductor, <b>tapped</b> <b>inductor,</b> transformer, and tapped transformer are modelled. Interleaved converters with coupled inductor, zero ripple phenomena in coupled inductor converters as well as integrated magnetic Cuk converter are also modelled. Modelling of integrated magnetic converters like integrated magnetic forward converter, integrated magnetic boost converter are also explored. To carry out all the simulations of proposed bond graph models, bond graph toolbox is developed using	MATLAB/SIMULINK. The MATLAB/SIMULINK is chosen since it is general simulation platform widely available. Therefore all the analysis and simulation can be carried out using facilities available in MATLAB/SIMULINK. Symbolic equation extraction toolbox is also developed which extracts state equations from bond graph model in SIMULINK in symbolic form...|$|E
