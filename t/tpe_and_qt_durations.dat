40|$|OBJECTIVE — Autonomic {{nervous system}} dysfunction, a {{correlate}} of obesity and poor car-diorespiratory fitness, {{is associated with}} the development of diabetes. We tested whether esti-mates of autonomic nervous system function improved in the intensive lifestyle versus metformin or placebo arms of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and whether baseline or a change in autonomic nervous system function was associated with the development of diabetes over 3. 2 years. RESEARCH DESIGN ANDMETHODS — In 2, 980 DPP participants, 12 -lead electro-cardiograms were measured at baseline and annually.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{investigate}} atrial conduction and ventricular repolarization inhomogeneities using P-wave dispersion (Pwd) <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> dispersion (QTd) analyses in acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Methods: Sixty patients were retrospectively included in this case-controlled study. Thirty acute CO poisoning patients were assigned to the Group with acute CO poisoning (ACOP). Patients who did not have acute CO poisoning were assigned to the control group (Group C, n= 30). Anthropometric measurement, body mass index, electrocardiogram (ECG) and serum electrolyte levels were recorded in all patients. Also, carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels were recorded in Group ACOP. Pwd, <b>QT</b> interval <b>and</b> <b>QTd</b> <b>durations</b> were measured. Corrected <b>QT</b> (QTc) <b>and</b> QTc dispersion (QTcd) intervals were determined with the Bazett formula. Independent samples t and Chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: No statistically significant difference was found between the age, gender distribution, anthropometric measurement, serum electrolytes, PR <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> <b>durations</b> between the groups. The Pwd (56. 33 ± 17. 11 msec vs 28. 33 ± 11. 16 msec, p< 0. 001) <b>and</b> <b>QTd</b> (63. 33 ± 26. 69 msec vs 42. 16 ± 7. 84 msec, p< 0. 001) were significantly longer in Group ACOP than in Group C. In addition, QTc and QTcd durations of Group ACOP were also found to be significantly longer than in Group C (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: In our study, we found in ECG analyses of patients with acute CO poisoning that the Pwd, QTc and QTcd durations were significantly prolonged when compared with control group. For this reason, patients with acute CO poisoning need close attention because of arrhythmias, which can be related to increased QTcd and Pwd durations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{evaluates the}} direct and autonomically {{mediated}} effects of oral quinidiee on ventricular repolarization in humans. Background. Interactions between quinidine-related vagolytic properties and autonomic modulation on ventricular repolarization are unknown. The relative role of the two components, if present, might improve {{our understanding of the}} therapeutic and proarrhythmic mechanisms of quinidine on the ventricular tissue. Methods. Rate-related changes in the QT interval were investigated after an abrupt increase in heart rate in 15 patients during atrial pacing. In the control study, the QT interval was measured at six paced cycle lengths (600, 540, 500, 460, 430 and 400 ms) both in the basal state and after autonomic, blockade (intravenous propranolol, 0. 2 mg/kg, and intravenous atropine, 0. 04 mg/kg); oral quinidine was then administered at a daily dosage of 1, 200 mg for 3 to 4 days, after which the <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> was reassessed using the same method in a second study. Results. During the control study, the mean slope of the regression curve estimating the correlation between pacing cycle length <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> was significantly lower after autonomic blockade (0. 14 ± 0. 05) than in the (0. 27 ± 0. 10, p < 0. 05). Quinidine exhibited a prominent but opposite effect on the mean slope of the regression curves in basal conditions (from 0. 27 ± 0. 10 to 0. 20 ± 0. 07, p < 0. 05) and after withdrawal of autonomic modulation (from 0. 14 ± 0. 05 to 0. 19 ± 0. 05, p < 0. 05), thus annulling the differences observed between the two states in the control study. Conclusions. A quinidine-induced increase in <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> as cycle length is prolonged is consistent with a reverse use dependence effect on ventricular repolarization. This effect is not evident in the basal state owing to interaction of quinidine-related vagolytic effect with the autonomic tone. Reverse use dependence and vagolytic activity on ventricular tissue indicate two potentially undesirable effects that could {{play a role in the}} lack of efficacy or proarrhythmic effect of quinidine...|$|R
40|$|Ventricular {{fibrosis}} is not {{the only}} structural determinant of arrhythmias in left ventricular hypertrophy. In an experimental model of. compensatory cardiac hypertrophy CCH the degree of cardiac hypertrophy is also independently linked to ventricular arrhythmias. Cardiac hypertrophy reflects the level of adaptation, and matches the adaptational modifications of the myocardial phenotype. We suggest. that these modifications have detrimental aspects. The increased action potential AP <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> the prolonged calcium transient both favour spontaneous calcium oscillations, and both are potentially arrhythmogenic and linked to phenotypic changes in membrane proteins. To date, only two ionic currents have been studied in detail: I is depressed likely the main determinant in APto. duration, and I, the pacemaker current, is induced in the overloaded ventricular myocytes. In rat CCH, the two components of thef sarcoplasmic reticulum, namely Ca 2 q-ATPase and ryanodine receptors, are down-regulated in parallel. Nevertheless, while the inward q 2 q q q. calcium current is unchanged, the functionally linked duo composed of the Na rCa exchanger and Na, K-ATPase, is less active. Such an imbalance may explain the prolonged calcium transient. The changes in heart rate variability provide information {{about the state of the}} autonomic nervous system and has prognostic value even in CCH. Transgenic studies have demonstrated that the myocardial adrenergic and muscarinic receptor content is also a determining factor. During CCH, several phenotypic membrane changes participat...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Despite its {{degradation}} by ectonucleotidases, interstitial {{adenosine triphosphate}} concentration ([ATP]out) increases after an {{acute myocardial infarction}} (AMI) and correlates with the occurrence of ventricular premature beats and ventricular tachycardia. It has been recently shown that extracellular ATP activates a depolarizing arrhythmogenic current carried by the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels TRPC 3 / 7. A decrease in [ATP]out could be a strategy to prevent arrhythmias during an acute ischemic episode. Previous results from our laboratories in a rat model of AMI suggest {{that this could be}} the case. Objective To study whether extracellular creatine would serve as a buffer for the sudden increase of [ATP]out and decrease arrhythmic events in an isolated rat heart model of AMI. Method Electrical and contractile activities were recorded on isolated Langendorff perfused rat hearts. The left coronary artery was occluded to induce a myocardial infarction. Results Under control condition, creatine (1 - 3 mmol/L) had no major effects on QRS <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> <b>durations</b> nor on RR interval or force of contraction. The ligature of the left coronary artery markedly decreased the ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT). However, when hearts were previously treated with creatine (1 - 3 mmol/L) the VFT was significantly higher after the AMI compared to untreated hearts. Moreover, in hearts perfused with creatine after coronary ligature, VFT was also increased but to a lesser extent. Conclusion Our results suggest that creatine, at a relatively high concentration, would serve as a buffer for the sudden release of ATP during the early phase of ischemia thus having an antiarrhythmic effect. status: publishe...|$|R

Furosemide, a potent diuretic, was given at increasing doses (5 – 60 mg/kg) to five male and five female beagle dogs. Electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded three times each day, simultaneous to blood sampling for measurement of plasma potassium. Furosemide treatment produced a clear hypokalaemia, which was associated with an increase in <b>QT</b> <b>and</b> corrected <b>QT</b> intervals (QTc) <b>duration.</b> On average, the slopes of the negative linear correlation between potassium plasma levels <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> or QTc were steeper in females than in males. These results show that a decrease in potassium plasma level may explain a concomitant increase in <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> in a toxicity study in dogs, in particular if potassium values are decreased below 3. 3 mmol/L. Correction of QT interval for Kþ plasma level has, therefore, been established separately for males and females. A global formula correcting <b>QT</b> for Kþ <b>and</b> heart rate simultaneously was established. Hypokalaemia was also associated with changes in the morphology of the T wave recorded in CV 5 RL, in particular, with a flattening and/or a notching of the wave (appearance of a second peak), biphasic aspect or inversion of polarity. These changes are probably related to an increased heterogeneity of repolarization between different populations of cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, hypokalaemia is quantitatively associated with an increase in <b>QT</b> <b>and</b> QTc <b>duration</b> in dogs. The relationship is apparently stronger for females than for males.

Chronic renal failure and hemodialysis (HD) patients may have longer corrected QT (QTc) interval compared with the normal population. Long QTc interval may be a predictor of ventricular arrhythmia and cardiovascular mortality in these patients and hence the aim of this study was the evaluation of the relationship between QTc interval and some echocardiographic findings and laboratory exam results in HD patients. Materials and Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 60 HD patients with age > 18 years and the dialysis duration > 3 months were enrolled. Blood samples were taken, and electrocardiography and echocardiography were done before the dialysis session in the patients. Results: Mean age of the patients was 56. 15 ± 14. 6 years. QTc interval of the patients was 0. 441 ± 0. 056 s <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> dispersion (QTd) was 64. 17 ± 25. 93 ms. There was no statistically significant relationship between QTc interval <b>and</b> <b>QTd</b> with <b>duration</b> of dialysis, body mass index, age, and gender (P > 0. 05). There was also no significant relationship between QTc interval <b>and</b> <b>QTd</b> with mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation and aortic insufficiency (P > 0. 05). In addition, QTc interval <b>and</b> <b>QTd</b> of the patients had not any correlation with serum parathormon and serum Ca, K, HCO 3 (P > 0. 05). Conclusion: Based on our results, in HD patients, QTc interval <b>and</b> <b>QTd</b> were not correlated with echocardiographic findings or laboratory exam results. Therefore, it can be concluded that QTc interval prolongation probably has not any correlation with cardiac mortality of the HD patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to study electrocardiographic {{features}} of double-muscled beef cattle. Electrocardiograms were recorded on one to six occasions from each {{of a group of}} 18 conventional calves of the Friesian breed and 29 double-muscled calves of the Belgian White and Blue breed. Ages of the calves at the times of examination ranged from eight to 348 days. The Holmes semi-orthogonal lead system was used. The waves and interval durations and the tridimensional P, QRS, and T modal vector orientation and amplitude were calculated. The magnitude of the cardiac vectors was significantly lower and the ventricular waves <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> interval <b>duration</b> significantly shorter in the double-muscled than in the conventional calves. The P modal vector pointed significantly less downwards and the QRS modal vector pointed significantly more forwards and less up- and rightwards in the Belgian White and Blue, than in the Friesian group. Most of the observed differences might be a consequence of the bodily, and more specifically the thoracic, conformation of the former calves. However, the lower cardiac vector magnitude and shorter wave and interval durations might also reflect lower cardiac mass in the double-muscled subjects...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the spectrum of}} electrocardiographic (ECG) changes in 1000 junior (18 or under) elite athletes. METHODS: A total of 1000 (73 % male) junior elite athletes (mean (SD) age 15. 7 (1. 4) years (range 14 - 18); mean (SD) body surface area 1. 73 (0. 17) m 2 (range 1. 09 - 2. 25)) and 300 non-athletic controls matched for gender, age, and body surface area had a 12 lead ECG examination. RESULTS: Athletes had a significantly higher prevalence of sinus bradycardia (80 % v 19 %; p< 0. 0001) and sinus arrhythmia (52 % v 9 %; p< 0. 0001) than non-athletes. The PR interval, QRS, <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> were more prolonged in athletes than non-athletes (153 (20) v 140 (18) milliseconds (p< 0. 0001), 92 (12) v 89 (7) milliseconds (p< 0. 0001), and 391 (27) v 379 (29) milliseconds (p = 0. 002) respectively). The Sokolow voltage criterion for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and the Romhilt-Estes points score for LVH was more common in athletes (45 % v 23 % (p< 0. 0001) and 10 % v 0 % (p< 0. 0001) respectively), as were criteria for left and right atrial enlargement (14 % v 1. 2 % and 16 % v 2 % respectively). None of the athletes with voltage criteria for LVH had left axis deviation, ST segment depression, deep T wave inversion, or pathological Q waves. ST segment elevation was more common in athletes than non-athletes (43 % v 24 %; p< 0. 0001). Minor T wave inversion (less than - 0. 2 mV) in V 2 and V 3 was present in 4 % of athletes and non-athletes. Minor T wave inversion elsewhere was absent in non-athletes and present in 0. 4 % of athletes. CONCLUSIONS: ECG changes in junior elite athletes are not dissimilar to those in senior athletes. Isolated Sokolow voltage criterion for LVH is common; however, associated abnormalities that indicate pathological hypertrophy are absent. Minor T wave inversions in leads other than V 2 and V 3 may be present in athletes and non-athletes less than 16 but should be an indication for further investigation in older athletes. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: It {{is thought}} that arrhythmias are {{responsible}} for sudden deaths in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP). QT intervals may predict malignant arrhythmia potential in these patients. The aim {{of the present study}} is to assess QT variables in patients with MVP. Methods: We studied 46 patients with non-rheumatic, uncomplicated and isolated MVP and 25 healthy control subjects. All individuals underwent full M-mode; two-dimensional and color-Doppler examinations. MVP was defined as superior displacement of the mitral leaflets of more than 2 mm during systole and as a maximal leaflet thickness of at least 5 mm during diastole. Maximum (QTmax), minimum (QTmin) <b>durations,</b> corrected <b>QT</b> intervals <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> dispersion were measured in every case. The results of MVP patients were compared with the data gathered from the control cases. Results: Demographic and clinical variables were similar between the two groups. Anterior mitral leaflet thickness (AMLD), maximal leaflet displacement (DMR) and degree of mitral regurgitation (DMR) were found to be significantly higher in the patient group. QTc max, <b>QT</b> dispersion (<b>QTd)</b> <b>and</b> corrected <b>QT</b> dispersion (QTcD) were also significantly higher in MVP patients. A significant and fairly strong correlation was found between QTc max, QTcD and AMLT, MLD <b>and</b> DMR. Conclusion: <b>QT</b> <b>durations</b> were significantly increased in patients with isolated MVP, which may explain increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in this population. Furthermore QT variables were related with the mitral leaflet thickness and degree of mitral regurgitation; which means QT variables increases with the the severity of the disease.

40|$|IntroductionAbsolute <b>QT</b> {{interval}} <b>duration</b> is classically corrected {{with heart}} rate {{according to the}} Bazett's formula (QTc). In general population, recommended upper limits of QTc values are 440 ms in males (M) and 450 ms in females (F). Upper limits of QTc duration in highly trained athletes make debate between European (440 ms in M and 460 ms in F) (1) and North-American recommendations (470 ms in M and 480 ms in F) (2). Lastly, a QTc > 500 ms seems highly suggestive of long QT syndrome in athletes (3). Thus, it is required to specify the upper limit cut-off value of QTc duration in a large population of athletes. MethodsIn this multicentric and prospective study, a resting 12 -lead ECG has been recorded in 1232 (357 F) French athletes. RR <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> intervals <b>duration</b> has been measured in DII with a tracer table on three successive cardiac cycles. Results Mean (SD) – discussionQT and QTc duration values were respectively 394. 8 (32. 5) ms and 393. 9 (24. 8) ms. A long QT was observed in 24 athletes (1. 9 %, 11 F) according to European values and only in 2 athletes (0. 2 %, 1 F) according to North-American values. These last prevalences were near from those reported in athletes (3), but were higher than in general population (4). We observed no gender difference for <b>QT</b> <b>and</b> QTc [QT 391. 0 (31. 9) ms and QTc 389. 1 (23. 9) ms for M; QT 401. 8 (33. 2) ms and QTc 405. 8 (23. 1) ms for F]. The slope of RR- 1 -QT relation was higher in F than in M (p< 0. 05, Fig. 1). Thus, for a similar resting RR, <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> was longer in F. ConclusionLimits of 470 ms in M and 480 ms in F for QTc duration seem more adapted in athletes. Further studies are needed concerning the individual risk evaluation for sports participation.

Despite growing prevalence in recent years, controversy still exists as to the pathogenetic mechanisms that underlie this entity. In this study we search the effect of isolated CAE on P-wave <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> interval dispersion. Patients and methods: Twenty patients (mean age: 60  ±  9. 7  years) with isolated CAE (group I) {{were included in the}} study and 18 control subjects (group II) matched in sex and age. Both groups underwent a standard 12 -lead surface electrocardiogram recorded at 50  mm/s. Maximal (P max) and minimal P-wave durations (P min) are measured.

40|$|International audienceAIMS: QTc {{interval}} prolongation and torsades de pointes {{have been}} reported in HIV-infected patients. Protease inhibitors (PIs) are suspected to contribute to this adverse reaction. However, many factors can prolong QTc interval. We examined factors influencing QTc duration in HIV-infected patients. METHODS: Unselected HIV-infected patients (n = 978) were enrolled in this prospective, single-centre cross-sectional study. Variables related to infection and treatments were collected. A digital electrocardiographic record was recorded in each patient <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> interval <b>duration</b> was measured and corrected using both Bazett's (QTcB) and Fridericia's (QTcF) formula. Results were analysed with a multivariable linear model. RESULTS: After excluding arrhythmias and complete bundle branch blocks, QT interval was measured in 956 patients. The mean (SD) QTcB was 418 ms (23) and QTcF was 405 ms (20). QTc was found prolonged (> 450 ms in women and > 440 ms in men) in 129 [13. 5 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 11. 5, 15. 8] and 38 (4 %; 95 % CI 2. 9, 5. 4) patients using Bazett and Fridericia corrections, respectively. On multivariable analysis, incomplete bundle branch block, ventricular hypertrophy, signs of ischaemic cardiopathy, female gender, White ethnic origin and age were significantly associated with QTc prolongation. The only HIV variable independently associated with QTc prolongation was the duration of infection (P = 0. 023). After adjustment, anti-HIV treatment, in particular PI (P = 0. 99), was not associated with QTc prolongation. CONCLUSIONS: Although PIs block in vitro hERG current, they are not independently associated with QTc interval prolongation. Prolonged QTc interval in HIV-infected patients is primarily associated with factors commonly known to prolong <b>QT</b> <b>and</b> with the <b>duration</b> of HIV infection...|$|R
40|$|Objective—To {{establish}} a general method {{to estimate the}} measuring error in QT dispersion (QTD) determination, and to assess this error using a computer program for automated measurement of QTD.  Subjects—Measurements were done on 1220  standard simultaneous 12  lead electrocardiograms.  Design—The computer program was validated against two observers on a random subset of 100  electrocardiograms. Simple laws of physics require that at least {{five of the six}} extremity leads have the same <b>QT</b> <b>duration.</b> This allows the direct assessment of the error in measuring QTD derived from five extremity leads (QTD 5). It also enables ST-T amplitude dependent distributions of measurement error in determining <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> to be established. These QT error distributions were then used to estimate the error in measuring QTD from all 12  leads (QTD 12).  Main outcome measures—Mean and standard deviation of error in measuring <b>QT</b> <b>duration,</b> QTD 5, <b>and</b> QTD 12.  Results—Performance of the program was comparable to that of observers. Errors in measuring <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> (measured <b>QT</b> minus reference QT) fell from a mean (SD) of 6. 9  (17. 1)  ms for ST-T amplitudes   350  µV. Measurement errors of QTD 5 and QTD 12 were 20. 4  (11. 5)  ms and 29. 4  (14. 9) ms.  Conclusions—The fact that no QTD can exist between five of the six extremity leads provides a means of estimating QTD measurement error. Measuring error of <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> is dependent on ST-T amplitude. QTD measurement error is large compared with typical QTD values reported.    Keywords: automated ECG analysis;  QT measurement;  QT dispersion;  measurement erro...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that in long-QT syndrome (LQT) type 1 (LQT 1), beta-blocker therapy may decrease both the diurnal maximal T-wave peak to T-wave end interval (<b>TPE)</b> <b>and</b> the maximal ratio between late and early T-wave peak amplitude (T 2 /T 1 ratio), which are electrocardiographic counterparts of transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) and early afterdepolarizations (EA), respectively. BackgroundVentricular repolarization duration and increased TDR and EAs are the three electrophysiological components generating the high risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in the inherited LQT. In the most prevalent LQT 1 form of LQT, treatment with beta-blockers reduces serious arrhythmia events dramatically without a known influence on <b>QT</b> interval <b>duration.</b> In experimental LQT 1 models, beta-blockers decrease TDR and prevent EAs. MethodsWe reviewed 24 -h electrocardiographic recordings obtained {{before and during the}} treatment with beta-blockers from 24 genotyped LQT 1 patients to record maximal <b>TPE</b> intervals <b>and</b> T 2 /T 1 ratios as well as maximal <b>and</b> rate-adapted <b>QT</b> intervals using a computer-assisted program. ResultsTreatment with beta-blockers decreased the maximal diurnal T 2 /T 1 amplitude ratio from 3. 0 ± 1. 0 to 2. 2 ± 0. 6 (p = 0. 002).

Methods: In a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary university teaching hospital in The Netherlands, all 1788 patients receiving haloperidol between 2005 and 2007 were studied; ninety-seven were suitable for final analysis. Rate-corrected <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> (QTc) was measured before, {{during and after}} haloperidol use.

Mixed model analysis was used to estimate changes in <b>QT</b> <b>duration.</b> Risk factors for potentially dangerous QT prolongation were estimated by logistic regression analysis. Results: Patients with normal before-haloperidol QTc duration (male = 450 ms, female >= 470 ms). In contrast, a significant decrease occurred in patients with borderline (male 430 - 450 ms, female 450 - 470 ms) or abnormal before-haloperidol QTc duration (15 ms and 46 ms, respectively); twenty-three percent of patients in the borderline group, and only 9 % of patients in the abnormal group obtained abnormal levels. Potentially dangerous QTc prolongation was independently associated with surgery before haloperidol use (OR(adj) 34. 9, p = 0. 009) and before-haloperidol QTc duration (OR(adj) 0. 94, p = 0. 004). Conclusion: QTc duration during haloperidol use changes differentially, increasing in patients with normal before-haloperidol QTc duration, but decreasing in patients with prolonged before-haloperidol QTc duration.
