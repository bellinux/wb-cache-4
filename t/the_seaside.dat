Shortly afterwards, Barcelona's municipal boundaries were reorganized and <b>the</b> Ribera (<b>seaside)</b> came under <b>the</b> Consell de Cent, so <b>the</b> Ribera (<b>seaside)</b> lost its autonomy.

5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>seaside</b> location, few {{residents}} {{make their}} living on the sea, and fishing {{is not a major}} industry. In the early 1970s, when fish stocks ran low, a system of rotating access was developed to preserve this sector. This innovative system was part of Elinor Ostrom's research on economic governance which led to her 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics. In 2007, locals protested the establishment of some larger chain supermarkets and clothing stores, which have opened branches in Alanya.|$|E

5|$|Race meetings, concert parties (including drag acts– good drag queens were {{in great}} demand), trips to <b>the</b> <b>seaside</b> and {{football}} matches were organised to keep men entertained.

Overt patriotism was rare, and politicians such as (Prime Minister) Asquith and Ramsay MacDonald (an opponent of the war, later Labour Prime Minister) were satirised.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{agriculture}} was {{the mainstay}} of the economy {{of this part of}} Wales, but with the Industrial Revolution, the North Wales Coalfield was developed and parts of eastern Clwyd around the Dee estuary and Wrexham became industrialised. The advent of the railway running from Chester along the North Wales coast in the mid-nineteenth century made it easy for urban dwellers from Lancashire and Cheshire to visit <b>the</b> <b>seaside</b> towns of North Wales, and nowadays, tourism is the main source of income in Clwyd.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that are}} {{important}} to the marsh rice rat's diet include insects, fiddler crabs, and snails, but the species is known to eat many other animals, including fish, clams, and juvenile Graptemys and Chrysemys turtles. They scavenge on carcasses of muskrats, deermice, and sparrows, and {{may be the most important}} predator on eggs and young of the marsh wren. Rice rats also eat eggs and young of <b>the</b> <b>seaside</b> sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus) and are aggressive towards the sparrow, apparently leading it to avoid nesting in Juncus in a seaside salt marsh in Florida. On islands in North Carolina, rice rats consume eggs of Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri). They have been observed preying on alligator eggs in Georgia.|$|E
5|$|As {{a student}} holidaying in coastal towns, Hesketh had {{become aware of}} the lack of resorts in Lancashire. He was {{concerned}} that the working classes of Lancashire could not afford to travel south for their holidays as wealthy people like him could. The number of railways in Great Britain steadily increased {{in the first half of}} the 19th century, and Hesketh was impressed by the arrival in 1828 of the steam locomotive in Lancashire. As High Sheriff of Lancashire, he attended the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway on 15 December 1830. The event filled him with great excitement at the idea of bringing the railway to the coast and enabling Lancashire mill workers to take day-trips to <b>the</b> <b>seaside.</b>|$|E
40|$|Container {{terminals}} (CTs) play {{an essential}} role in the global transportation system. To deal with growing container shipments, a CT needs to better solve <b>the</b> three essential <b>seaside</b> operational problems; berth allocation problem (BAP), quay crane assignment problem (QCAP), and quay crane scheduling problem (QCSP), which affect the performance of a CT considerably. In past studies, <b>the</b> three <b>seaside</b> operational problems have often been solved individually or partially, which is likely to result in poor overall system performance. However, solving <b>the</b> three <b>seaside</b> operational problems simultaneously is in fact a very complicated task. In this research, we dealt with <b>the</b> three <b>seaside</b> operational problems at the same time by using a novel high-level Petri net, termed an Object-Oriented and Timed Predicate/Transition Net (OOTPr/Tr net). After defining <b>the</b> three <b>seaside</b> operational problems formally, we integrated them as a three-level framework that was further transformed into an OOTPr/Tr net model. Then, using the Prolog programming language, we implemented this model as a simulation tool to find the best solution based on the various combinations of heuristic rules used...|$|R

5|$|Dorset {{is largely}} rural with many small villages, few large towns and no cities.

Agriculture continues to be a major business, if no longer a major employer because of mechanisation. Light industries are based in towns such as Bridgwater and Yeovil.
