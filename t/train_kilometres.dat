40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare risk levels, based on reported railway occurrences, across Australian states. A secondary aim was to use these numbers to assess the impact of a new reporting system, ON-S 1, introduced in 2004, on the calculated risk levels. The Australian nationwide standard, ON-S 1, defines how to categorize occurrences and their consequences, but it has not been consistently applied in all states. For example, New South Wales and Victoria use broader definitions of 'serious injury' than specified in ON-S 1. This paper outlines challenges related to ON-S 1 's use and the appropriateness of calculating risks based on reported occurrences. Railway occurrence data from five Australian states/territories from 2001 to 2007 were reviewed. Data on fatalities, serious injuries and <b>train</b> <b>kilometres</b> were obtained from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and The Independent Transport Safety and reliability Regulator's (ITSRR) safety reports. We used these data to calculate an index of Fatalities and Weighted Injuries (FWI), normalized for <b>train</b> <b>kilometres.</b> The results showed that the average annual risk per million <b>train</b> <b>kilometres</b> for the entire period (2001 - 2007) was highest in New South Wales (FWI 1. 28), followed by Victoria (FWI 0. 89), South Australia (FWI 0. 77), Queensland (FWI 0. 34) and Western Australia (FWI 0. 26). Following the introduction of ON-S 1, the FWI in New South Wales and Victoria doubled from 2004 to 2006. These trends continued into the first half of 2007. The other states showed a stable or decreasing trend. The highest risk appeared to be in the states with the largest populations containing Australia's largest cities. The use of <b>train</b> <b>kilometres</b> to normalize occurrence rates may be inappropriate because this measure does not take into account the number of people travelling on each train. The sharp increase in reported occurrences in New South Wales and Victoria may reflect the misuse of ON-S 1, because a similar increase was not observed in the other states. The large difference in risk level between states highlights a need for consistent application of the national reporting regime in Australia to enable valid comparisons of occurrence rates between states. 6 page(s...|$|E

30|$|As {{part of the}} Next Generation Train (NGT) project {{presented}} at InnoTrans 2008 scientists of German Aerospace Center (DLR) are developing intelligent concepts to meet future demands of vehicle requirements. In Germany diesel multiple units (DMU) are widely used in regional traffic on non-electrified lines. In 2003 Deutsche Bahn operated about 1300 DMUs [1] and in 2004 more than 75 % of diesel traction <b>train</b> <b>kilometres</b> of Deutsche Bahn were accomplished by DMUs. This is a share of 18.1 % of Deutsche Bahn’s overall <b>train</b> <b>kilometres</b> in passenger transport [2]. DMUs are essential to provide passenger service in regional traffic on lines with low utilization. They are either single coaches or fixed coupled coaches consisting of 2 or max. 3 power cars. Normally each power car is driven by one medium power diesel engine (250  kW– 560  kW) which is often a derivate of truck or industrial engines. Basically three variants of propulsion systems are used in DMUs: diesel-electric, diesel-hydraulic and diesel-hydro-mechanical. In terms of efficiency the hydro-mechanical propulsion system is superior to the other ones, reaching a maximum efficiency of 95 % compared to 85 % for electric and hydraulic power trains [3, 4].|$|E

40|$|It {{is argued}} that {{improvements}} in the supply of transport infrastructure networks affect accessibility, which in turn influences the distribution of land uses, activities linked to them and eventually the travel behaviour of individuals. Identifying the extent and rate of change in travel behaviour {{as a response to}} change in spatial and socio-demographic characteristics, requires long-term empirical investigation of their interrelation. The assessment of long-term trends can provide guidelines for the type, extent and location of future investments in transport and land use development. This paper explores trends in access to transport infrastructure (proximity to the railway stations), land use (location of inhabitants), socio-demographic characteristics of the travellers and travel behaviour (distance travelled by car, train and active modes and total number of trips per day) over three decades. It uses data from Dutch National Travel Surveys at seven time points of five-year intervals from 1980 to 2010 in the Randstad, the Netherlands. The results indicate that while the total number of trips per day has remained stable over time, total kilometres travelled has risen until the mid- 1990 s after which it has witnessed a decrease. Further more, the findings suggest that train is increasingly used for travelling longer distances and the location of home municipality and proximity to train stations (within a distance of 500 to 1250 m) are closely related to the total <b>train</b> <b>kilometres</b> travelled...|$|E
40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about train suicide and factors {{influencing}} its prevalence. This study tests the hypotheses that railway density, railway transportation volume, familiarity with railway transportation and population density contribute to train suicide. It also tests the relationship between train suicide and general population suicide and examines the prevalence and the characteristics of high-risk locations and their contribution to the grand total of train suicides. Methods: Trends in train suicides were compared with trends in railway track length, <b>train</b> <b>kilometres,</b> passenger kilometres and national suicide figures over the period 1950 - 2007. The geographical distribution over the national network over the period 1980 - 2007 was studied. Data were obtained from The Netherlands Railways, Prorail and Statistics Netherlands. Results: 1. The incidence of train suicides is unrelated to railway parameters. 2. Being familiar with railway transportation as a passenger is not a contributory factor. 3. Train suicide rates are unrelated to regional population density. 4. The incidence of train suicides parallels that of general population suicides. 5. Half of the train suicides took place at {{a limited number of}} locations, the most important of which were situated within a village or town and were close to a psychiatric hospital. Limitations: Most conclusions are based on correlational relationships between variables. Conclusions: 1. Train suicide trends reflect trends in general population suicides. 2. Increased train transportation does not lead to more train suicides. 3. The prevention of train suicide at high-risk locations (HRLs) in built-up areas and near psychiatric hospitals deserves first priority. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{expands the}} {{exploratory}} analysis undertaken by Vigoroux-Steck (1990), who used statistical cost techniques, {{in conjunction with}} UIC published data, to estimate cost functions for 13 Western European railway operations. Four improvements {{have been made to}} Steck's work. Firstly, the data has been up-dated from 1987 to 1990 and re-indexed to incorporate the most recent information on international prices. Secondly, consistency is introduced into the Returns to Scale and Density measures by including all relevant estimated parameter values. Thirdly, we constrain the repssion model to insure linear homogeneity of degree one in factor prices. Fourthly, we attempt to reduce statistical problems by redefining variables around the sample mean (although there is further work to be undertaken in this respect). Three further amendments were undertaken with limited success. Attempts to introduce a more complex treatment of technological change led to implausible returns to scale. Attempts to re-define the returns to density measure by using a length of line variable rather than a density (<b>train</b> <b>kilometres</b> divided by length of line) variable also led to some implausible results. A re-definition of Steck's returns to density measure gave more plausible results. Despite these statistical problems, some common results do come hmgh. In particular, it appears that Western Europe's largest railways exhibit decreasing returns to scale and increasing returns to density. This does suggest that some European railways are operating beyond the point of maximum efficient scale and re-organisation into smaller units may be sensible. Our findings are less robust on how small these units should be. Railways with less than 3, 000 km of route may be below the minimum efficient scale. Another important finding is that some Western Europe railways do exhibit diseconomies of density most notably those of Switzerland and the Netherlands. Proposed expansion of infrastructure in these countries may be sensible. Lastly, in terms of an index of managerial efficiency, we find that the railway of Sweden is a consistently high performer and those of Austria and Belgium poor performers. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of simulating the effects of introducing competition on a long distance international rail passenger route where there is also a strong domestic market served by high speed trains. We are aware of a number of proposals to introduce new services in such circumstances. It has allowed for the fact that on such a service seat reservations are likely to be compulsory and yield management practiced, so that whatever is initially assumed about fares there will be further endogenous changes in average fares to maintain high load factors. It is found that on-track competition has benefits to consumers, in terms of fares and services, but that it would reduce the profitability of the incumbent {{and that it would be}} difficult for the new entrant to attain profitability unless its costs were significantly lower than those of the incumbent. A large part of the revenue of the entrant on this route would come from the domestic market, and if open access competition were permitted then the entrant might seek to run a frequent service offering head on competition on this part of the route. However, again it would appear that both operators would make heavy losses in this situation. One way of restoring profitability might be to reduce track access charges, but that would require additional government subsidy to the infrastructure manager, as the additional <b>train</b> <b>kilometres</b> run would not compensate for the lower charges. An alternative way of seeking to achieve the same result as on track competition in terms of reduced costs and innovation whilst preserving economies of density would be to award a monopoly franchise by means of competitive tendering. Franchising has generally succeeded in raising rail demand and reducing costs, although in the one example where inter-city services were franchised – Britain – costs have actually risen. Thus unless this is due to peculiarities of the British situation which would not exist elsewhere, on track competition may still have a role in reducing costs...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{adopts a}} {{holistic}} approach towards railway track capacity to develop methodologies for {{different aspects of}} defining, measuring, analysing, improving and controlling track capacity utilisation. Chapter 1 presents {{an overview of the}} concept of capacity and the railway capacity challenge is explained. Chapter 2 focuses on past approaches to defining and analysing the concept of railway capacity. Existing methods for estimating capacity utilisation are studied in four categories: analytical methods, parametric models, optimisation and simulation. Chapter 3 examines various factors affecting capacity utilisation. Chapter 4 develops the systems engineering foundation toward railway capacity. From process improvement methods, Six Sigma and its Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and Control (DMAIC) cycle is chosen as the underlying framework of the thesis. Chapter 5 defines lean, micro and macro capacity utilisation based on the discrete nature of railway capacity. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to develop two novel methodologies to analyse lean capacity utilisation. A DEA model analyses relative efficiency of train operating companies based on their efficiency to transform allocated train paths (timetabled <b>train</b> <b>kilometres)</b> and franchise payments to passenger-kilometres while avoiding delays. A case study demonstrates its application to 16 train operating companies in the UK. The operational efficiency of stations is benchmarked from similar studies for ports and airports. Two models are developed for analysing technical efficiency and service effectiveness. 96 busiest stations in Great Britain are analysed by this method. For analysing capacity utilisation in the freight sector, the concept of ‘profit-generating capacity’ is introduced in chapter 6. It is applied in an American freight case study to choose between bulk and intermodal trains in a heterogeneous traffic. DEA is also used in another case study for identifying the most profitable commodities. Chapter 7 suggests using variation reduction and failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) to control capacity utilisation. For improving railway capacity utilisation it is suggested to find and improve the weakest line section, the weakest trains and the weakest station. A real world case study of the South West Main Line in Great Britain, demonstrates applying these aspects. For finding the weakest line section two existing methods of the UIC 406 and the CUI method are compared with each other. For finding the weakest trains a meso index is suggested. It can identify which trains can be removed to free up some capacity in the busiest section of the line. Simulating delays and removing the highest delay causing trains is another method suggested. The weakest stations are identified by applying the DEA methodology developed in chapter 5. Target values for train stops at each station are suggested to be fed to the tactical timetabling. It is concluded that developing methodologies to analyse, improve and control railway capacity utilisation is needed and the methodologies proposed in this thesis can be a stepping stone towards them.

40|$|We analyse {{the reform}} {{process in the}} German railway sector. We {{take a look at}} the process and the outcome of the reform and compare it with the {{theoretical}} findings. The regionalisation of the regional rail passenger services is of a special importance to us. We scrutinise the contracts for the provision of these services and try to find interrelations between the different contract elements. A further emphasis is placed on the influence of the European Commission on the reform process. We analyse the European Commissions policy on railway infrastructure charges and the charging principles to be found in the member states. In the following we summarise the contents of the three subsequent chapters. In chapter 2, we analyse the rail reform process that started in the year 1994. Our focus is set on the long-distance passenger transport and the freight transport, while the regional rail passenger transport is left to chapter 3. We identify the main stakeholders and their interests. The negotiations between the politicians and the managers of the railway company in the reform process are analysed using a bargaining model. Assuming opportunistic behaviour of politicians, we explain some issues of the railway reform in Germany. We adapt a model which was developed by Shleifer & Vishny in 1994. Public firms are seen as a vehicle for the government to win elections. State-owned enterprises produce benefits for the politicians in the form of excess employment or other output. If the government chooses to cut its control over the firm, there is still the possibility to influence the firm by subsidies. We present some evidence that the model’s prediction were realised with the corporatisation in 1994. It can be acknowledged as far as the employment is concerned, as it rapidly decreased after 1994. In long-distance passenger transport and in freight transport, restructuring processes were pursued. The performance in both segments decreased after 1994, at least in terms of market shares. There is also evidence that infrastructure was closed down after the commercialisation. However, the effect of the commercialisation on the infrastructure is not as eminent as for the employment or the transport services, as a total closing down of rail infrastructure has to be approved by the authorities. Another question is whether the commercialisation of the DB AG led to an increase in subsidies, as predicted by the model. We find that the model’s predictions are ambiguous if there is a simultaneous increase in the political costs of subsidies, which is quite likely to have happened. As a part of the reform of the German rail sector, the organisation of the local and regional rail services was changed in 1996. The intention was to create a more transparent procurement of the transport services. In chapter 3, we describe the institutional framework and the market structure. Our special focus is on the design of the contracts between the public authorities and the railway undertakings. These contracts are analysed using a unique data base. They exhibit a remarkable heterogeneity not only in terms of duration and network size but also concerning the degree of service specification and risk allocation. We try to establish interrelations between some design features of the contracts. In a first regression, we find that the contract duration is dependent on the annual <b>train</b> <b>kilometres,</b> the time span between the publishing of the tender and the start of the services, and the provision of public instruments to mitigate the risk from rolling stock investment. For a second estimation, we create a measure for the completeness of the service contracts. We find that the completeness is determined by the time span between the publishing of the tender and the start of the services, the provision of demand information, and the obligation to become a member of the regional public transport association. The rail infrastructure of each of the European Union’s member states is used by different rail undertakings. The allocation of this infrastructure capacity is done using charging systems. The European Commission has strived to open the railway markets since the beginning of the 1990 s by influencing the price regulation. The core element of the “First Railway Package” was a directive to shape the charging systems across the member states. In chapter 4, we identify standard pricing principles do be used for rail infrastructure. The economic aims of the pricing principles are contrasted with the content of the above mentioned directive. Scrutinizing the charging systems of different member states it is found that there is a broad variety in terms of the level of charges and their structure. We use the theoretical and empirical findings to formulate recommendations to enhance the rail infrastructure charging systems...|$|E

40|$|Given that {{virtually}} all British passenger train services were franchised out over the period 1995 - 7, and many have now been franchised for a second time, Britain should provide an excellent opportunity to study the impact of franchising passenger rail services. Moreover, since several different franchising models have been tried, there should also be some useful evidence {{on how best to}} go about franchising. In practice, however, the turbulent history of the British rail industry over this period makes drawing firm conclusions difficult. At the start, it appeared that franchising was very successful with strong competition for franchises, rapidly rising traffic, rising productivity and falling subsidies. Whilst most of the increase in traffic was due to external factors, the growth appears somewhat faster than would be explained by these factors alone. Despite this, a number of train operating companies got into financial difficulties, particularly in the Regional sector, where franchisees were relying on reduced costs rather than increased revenues to achieve subsidy reductions, and in the short term franchises were renegotiated or replaced with cost-plus contracts pending refranchising. After the bankruptcy of Railtrack not only have the costs and performance of the infrastructure manager severely deteriorated, but there has also been a large rise in the costs of train operating companies. Without {{a better understanding of the}} causes of this rise it is hard to form firm conclusions on the success of franchising. One argument is that one of the reasons franchisees found it difficult to achieve the anticipated cost reductions was the degree to which costs had already been driven down in the 1980 s. However costs did start to rise again in the early 1990 s and in the early years of franchising substantial savings in costs per <b>train</b> <b>kilometre</b> were achieved, with cost increases only following later. A second suggested explanation for the cost increase is the temporary placing of many Train Operating Companies on management contracts or renegotiation of franchises around 2001. We have found some support for this hypothesis, with our analysis showing that the affected TOCs experienced higher cost growth than other TOCs. A third argument is that the increase in costs in the last few years may have been driven by factors unrelated to the franchising process, and in particular, other aspects of policy such as health and safety legislation, disability discrimination legislation and a general requirement for higher standards. It is hard to be definitive on which of these three effects dominates, but we do have evidence which suggests that the way in which problem franchises were managed may have contributed substantially to the rise in costs after 1999 / 00. Our overall conclusion then is that passenger rail franchising in Britain may be regarded as a moderate success on the demand side, but that it has failed to achieve its objectives on the cost side. However, it should be noted that the rise in train operating costs in recent years has occurred at a time of considerable disruption, during which many other factors unrelated to franchising policy were changing at the same time. It remains to be seen what the re-franchising process will achieve in terms of cost reduction in a more stable environment...|$|R

We have found some support for this hypothesis, with our analysis showing that the affected TOCs experienced higher cost growth than other TOCs. A third argument is that the increase in costs in the last few years may have been driven by factors unrelated to the franchising process, and in particular, other aspects of policy such as health and safety legislation, disability discrimination legislation and a general requirement for higher standards. It is hard to be definitive on which of these three effects dominates, but we do have evidence which suggests that the way in which problem franchises were managed may have contributed substantially to the rise in costs after 1999 / 00. Our overall conclusion then is that passenger rail franchising in Britain may be regarded as a moderate success on the demand side, but that it has failed to achieve its objectives on the cost side. However, it should be noted that the rise in train operating costs in recent years has occurred at a time of considerable disruption, during which many other factors unrelated to franchising policy were changing at the same time. It remains to be seen what the re-franchising process will achieve in terms of cost reduction in a more stable environment. * We have greatly benefited from comments on an earlier draft by a number of people including, Mary Bonar, Richard Davies, Jeremy Drew, Peter Kain, John Glover, Lou Thompson and Steve Perkins.

40|$|Our aim was {{to detect}} changes in {{infrared}} radiation, overloaded structures of the musculoskeletal system at {{the main part of}} the shoulder girdle and upper body with the help of elite swimmers of Kometa Brno. First measurement was done before training and second 15 minutes after training in water in the swimming pool. The group consisted of seven Czech national swimmers. Athletes participated in testing during six months. Every measurement contains four positions. Front and back side, right and left side. Every athlete went through 13 measurements. We directed infrared thermograph camera FlukeTiR at 10 muscular groups that are most used in swimming. Besides we have form about <b>training</b> with <b>kilometres,</b> other exercise out of water, competitions, illness and be absent at training and other pain muscles, ligaments etc. We have analysed all temperatures only of one swimmer. Here was significant increased temperature after swimming only in deltoideus anterior at right side (from 33, 4 ± 1, 02 °C to 34, 0 ± 0, 69 °C). The other temperature was significant decreased: muscles groups of pectoralis major and minor (right side from 33, 6 ± 0, 92 to 33, 1 ± 0, 61 °C; left side from 33, 8 ± 0, 82 to 33, 1 ± 0, 69 °C), latissimus dorsi and erector spinae - pars lumbalis at both sides together. Five of twenty muscle regions have notable tendencies of increased temperatures, including a front part of deltoideus at right side which is very active by spreading arm forward and beginning of swimming stroke. In nine areas, including the main agonist for swimmers movement forward - triceps brachii, we found out only no significant lowering of temperatures. That was caused by cooling of the swimmer in the water. We have next six swimmers to analysis...|$|R

On July 13-14, 1942, the remaining {{population of the}} Równe ghetto - about 5,000 Jews - was sent by <b>train</b> some 70 <b>kilometres</b> north to Kostopol where they were murdered by the 1st company of the Police Front-Battalion [...] "Ostland" [...] in a quarry near woods outside the town. The Równe ghetto was subsequently liquidated. As {{reported on}} July 14, 1942: The battalion or elements of it provided security along with the Ukrainische Hilfspolizei for a transport of the Jews from the Riga Ghetto to the Riga Central Station using the wagons (1st company). July 15, 1942 another thousand Jews were executed in the same place. As reported on June 27, 1942, ca 8,000 Jews of the Słonim Ghetto were executed {{on the outskirts of}} Słonim. As reported on July 28, 1942, ca 6,000 Jews were executed in Minsk. In November 1942 the Police Battalion Ostland together with an artillery regiment, and three other German Ordnungspolizei battalions under the command of Befehlshaber der Ordnungspolizei im Reichskommissariat Ukraine and SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei Otto von Oelhafen, took part in a joint anti-partisan operation near Owrucz with over 50 villages burnt down and over 1,500 people executed. In a village 40 people were burnt alive for revenge for the killing of the SS-Untersturmführer Türnpu(u). February 1943: In Revel, Estonia with Polizei Füsilier Bataillon 293. By March 31, 1943, the Estnische Legion had 37 officers, 175 noncoms and 62 privates of the Ostland special battalion.|$|R
40|$|Most {{mathematical}} {{models of}} athletic training require the quantification of training intensity and quantity or ‘dose’. We aim to summarize both the methods available for such quantification, particularly {{in relation to}} cycle sport, and the mathematical techniques {{that may be used}} to model the relationship between training and performance. Endurance athletes have used <b>training</b> volume (<b>kilometres</b> per week and/or hours per week) as an index of training dose with some success. However, such methods usually fail to accommodate the potentially important influence of training intensity. The scientific literature has provided some support for alternative methods such as the session rating of perceived exertion, which provides a subjective quantification of the intensity of exercise; and the heart rate-derived training impulse (TRIMP) method, which quantifies the training stimulus as a composite of external loading and physiological response, multiplying the training load (stress) by the training intensity (strain). Other methods described in the scientific literature include ‘ordinal categorization’ and a heart rate-based excess post-exercise oxygen consumption method. In cycle sport, mobile cycle ergometers (e. g. SRM™ and PowerTap™) are now widely available. These devices allow the continuous measurement of the cyclists' work rate (power output) when riding their own bicycles during training and competition. However, the inherent variability in power output when cycling poses several challenges in attempting to evaluate the exact nature of a session. Such variability means that average power output is incommensurate with the cyclist's physiological strain. A useful alternative may be the use of an exponentially weighted averaging process to represent the data as a ‘normalized power’. Several research groups have applied systems theory to analyse the responses to physical training. Impulse-response models aim to relate training loads to performance, taking into account the dynamic and temporal characteristics of training and, therefore, the effects of load sequences over time. Despite the successes of this approach it has some significant limitations, e. g. an excessive number of performance tests to determine model parameters. Non-linear artificial neural networks may provide a more accurate description of the complex non-linear biological adaptation process. However, such models may also be constrained by the large number of datasets required to ‘train’ the model. A number of alternative mathematical approaches such as the Performance-Potential-Metamodel (PerPot), mixed linear modelling, cluster analysis and chaos theory display conceptual richness. However, much further research is required before such approaches can be considered as viable alternatives to traditional impulse-response models. Some of these methods may not provide useful information about the relationship between training and performance. However, they may help describe the complex physiological training response phenomenon...|$|R
