500|$|Kolbe's {{recognition}} as a Christian martyr also created some controversy within the Catholic Church. While his ultimate self-sacrifice of his life was most certainly considered saintly and heroic, he was not killed strictly speaking out of odium fidei (hatred of the faith), but {{as the result of}} an act of Christian charity. Pope Paul VI himself had recognized this distinction at his beatification by naming him a Confessor and giving him the unofficial title [...] "martyr of charity". Pope John Paul II, however, when deciding to canonize him, overruled the commission he had established (which agreed with the earlier assessment of heroic charity), wishing <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the systematic hatred of (whole categories of) humanity propagated by the Nazi regime was in itself inherently an act of hatred of religious (Christian) faith, meaning Kolbe's death equated to martyrdom.|$|E

2500|$|The King {{family and}} {{others believe that}} the {{assassination}} {{was carried out by}} a conspiracy involving the U.S. government, as alleged by Loyd Jowers in 1993, and that Ray was a scapegoat. In 1999 the King family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Jowers for the sum of $10 million. During closing arguments, the Kings' attorney asked the jury to award damages of $100, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> [...] "it was not about the money". During the trial both the family and Jowers presented evidence alleging a government conspiracy. The government agencies accused could not defend themselves or respond because they were not named as defendants. Based on the evidence, the jury concluded that Jowers and others were [...] "part of a conspiracy to kill King" [...] and awarded the Kings $100. The allegations and the finding of the Memphis jury were later rejected by the United States Department of Justice in 2000 due to lack of evidence.|$|E

Dawkins {{declares}} {{that there was}} no first person, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> evolutionary biologists use the term species to demark differences in gene composition— over often thousands of generations of separation— rather than from any one generation to the next. To illustrate this he undertakes a thought-experiment involving family photographs. If, hypothetically, there existed a complete set of photographs of all one's direct male ancestors arranged in order of birth date (or hatch date) from youngest to oldest stretching back millions of generations, {{from one generation to the}} next one would not perceive much difference between any two adjacent pictures—looking at a picture of one's grandfather or great-grandfather one is looking at a picture of a human—but if one looked at a picture from 185 million generations back one would see an image of some kind of fish-like animal. Dawkins stresses this point by saying the offspring of any sexually reproducing life form belongs in almost all cases to the same species as do its parents, with the exception of unviable hybrids such as mules.|$|E
2500|$|Literary critics such as David Schalkwyk {{see this}} sonnet as playing out a {{relationship}} with unequal power. He sees this relationship in Sonnets 26, 57, 58 and notes that it is strongest in 57 saying [...] "This sonnet's hyperbolic reference to slavery invokes more clearly the late-sixteenth-century, almost wholly pejorative sense of vassalage...". With the first lines of the sonnet being, [...] "Being your slave what should I do but tend Upon the hours, and times of your desire?" [...] it clearly correlates back to Schalkwyk's idea that Shakespeare seemingly emphasises a class difference {{or at the very}} least a power difference between Shakespeare and the Fair Youth that the sonnet addresses. Schalkwyk goes on to say [...] "This declaration of abject powerlessness (i.e. aforementioned slavery) pushes the notion of vassalage away from that of feudal reciprocity toward a commonplace early modern conception of the servant as utterly, submissive, silent and undemanding". Schalkwyk seems <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> during this period servitude was not viewed then as we view it today, but as something quietly accepted, linking to Shakespeare's [...] "servitude" [...] to the Fair Youth as something he is not resentful of, simply accepting the fact that as the speaker his rank in society was less than the addressee and that his position as a [...] "servant" [...] or [...] "slave" [...] to the Fair Youth was nothing more than a simple fact.|$|E

40|$|Athenian tragic poets {{were careful}} to {{separate}} the ‘heroic’ world {{from the world of}} their ffth-century audience, and they did so by deploying the twin dynamic of ‘distance and diference’.

The Aias of Sophocles is used <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> demonstrating that <b>the</b> playwright attempted to construct a unity from his character’s rather mixed history, in doing so to appeal to his audience’s sense of their own place in the world...|$|R

6000|$|Kate's face {{struck him}} as {{replying}} at first that his derisive speech deserved no satisfaction; then she appeared to yield to a need of her own--the need <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> [...] "as ill as she looked" [...] was what Milly scarce could be. If she had been as ill as she looked she could scarce be a question with them, for her end would in that case be near. She believed herself nevertheless--and Kate couldn't help believing her too--seriously menaced. There was always {{the fact that they}} had been on the point of leaving town, the two ladies, and had suddenly been pulled up. [...] "We bade them good-bye--or all but--Aunt Maud and I, the night before Milly, popping so very oddly into the National Gallery for a farewell look, found you and me together. They were then to get off a day or two later. But they've not got off--they're not getting off. When I see them--and I saw them this morning--they have showy reasons. They do mean to go, but they've postponed it." [...] With which the girl brought out: [...] "They've postponed it for you." [...] He protested so far as a man might without fatuity, since a protest was itself credulous; but Kate, as ever, understood herself. [...] "You've made Milly change her mind. She wants not to miss you--though she wants also not to show she wants you; which is why, as I hinted a moment ago, she may consciously have hung back to-night. She doesn't know when she may see you again--she doesn't know she ever may. She doesn't see the future. It has opened out before her in these last weeks as a dark confused thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{unexpectedly}} had acted, by {{a sudden}} turn of Kate's attitude, as a happy speech. She had risen as she spoke, and Kate had stopped before her, shining at her instantly with a softer brightness. Poor Milly hereby enjoyed one of her views of how people, wincing oddly, were often touched by her. [...] "Because you're a dove." [...] With which she felt herself ever so delicately, so considerately, embraced; not with familiarity or as a liberty taken, but almost ceremonially and {{in the manner of}} an accolade; partly as if, though a dove who could perch on a finger, one were also a princess with whom forms were to be observed. It even came to her, through the touch of her companion's lips, that this form, this cool pressure, fairly sealed the sense of what Kate had just said. It was moreover, for the girl, like an inspiration: she found herself accepting as the right one, while she caught her breath with relief, the name so given her. She met it on the instant as she would have met the revealed truth; it lighted up the strange dusk in which she lately had walked. That was what was the matter with her. She was a dove. Oh, wasn't she?--it echoed within her as she became aware of the sound, outside, of the return of their friends. There was, the next thing, little enough doubt about it after Aunt Maud had been two minutes in the room. She had come up, Mrs. Lowder, with Susan--which she needn't have done, at that hour, instead of letting Kate come down to her; so that Milly could be quite sure it was to catch hold, in some way, of the loose end they had left. Well, the way she did catch was simply <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> it didn't now in the least matter. She had mounted the stairs for this, and she had her moment again with her younger hostess while Kate, on the spot, as the latter at the time noted, gave Susan Shepherd unwonted opportunities. Kate was in other words, as Aunt Maud engaged her friend, listening with the handsomest response to Mrs. Stringham's impression of the scene they had just quitted. It was in the tone of the fondest indulgence--almost, really, that of dove cooing to dove--that Mrs. Lowder expressed to Milly the hope that it had all gone beautifully. Her [...] "all" [...] had an ample benevolence; it soothed and simplified; she spoke {{as if it were the}} two young women, not she and her comrade, who had been facing the town together. But Milly's answer had prepared itself while Aunt Maud was on the stair; she had felt in a rush all the reasons that would make it the most dovelike; and she gave it, while she was about it, as earnest, as candid. [...] "I don't think, dear lady, he's here." ...|$|E
