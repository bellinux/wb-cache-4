50|$|The term {{feature is}} used to denote a unit of {{functionality}} of a software application. Similar to many concepts in computer science, the term can be used {{at different levels of}} abstraction. For example, the plain old telephone service (POTS) is a telephony application feature at one level, but itself is composed of originating features and terminating features. The originating features may in turn include the provide dial <b>tone</b> feature, <b>digit</b> collection feature and so on.|$|R
50|$|In the Chinese tradition, numbers, diacritics, {{and names}} are {{assigned}} to the historical four tones of Chinese. These are consistent across all Chinese dialects, reflecting the development of tone diachronically. However, it is also common to number the tones of a particular dialect independently of the others. For example, Standard Chinese has four-five <b>tones</b> and the <b>digits</b> 1-5 or 0-4 {{are assigned to}} them; Cantonese has 6-9 <b>tones,</b> and the <b>digits</b> from 0 or 1 to 6 or 9 are assigned to them. In this case, Mandarin tone 4 {{has nothing to do}} with Cantonese tone 4, as can be seen by comparing the tone charts of Standard Chinese (Mandarin), Cantonese, and Taiwanese Hokkien.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether femoral artery pulsatility index (pi) can be used as an indicator of vasomotor <b>tone</b> in the <b>digit</b> of an ungulate species by measuring the change in pi induced by infusion of vasoactive agents in halothane-anaesthetised sheep. Intra-arterial infusion of the vasoconstrictor phenylephrine (9 μg min− 1) tended to increase waveform pi (3. 89 – 6. 24, n= 4, P= 0. 100). Infusion of a low dose (3 μg min− 1) of the vasodilator sodium nitroprusside did not alter femoral artery pi, however infusion of a higher dose (30 μg min− 1) tended to increase pi (5. 39 – 6. 70, n= 5, P= 0. 059). During these studies heart rate, mean abp and paCO 2 did not change significantly. The tendency for pi to increase in response to vasodilation was unexpected and the mechanism involved is unclear. It appears that femoral artery pi cannot be used to predict vasomotor <b>tone</b> in the <b>digit</b> of the anaesthetised sheep...|$|R
40|$|Congenital amusia is a {{disorder}} {{that affects the}} perception and production of music. While amusia {{has been associated with}} deficits in pitch discrimination, several reports suggest that memory deficits also play a role. The present study investigated short-term memory span for pitch-based and verbal information in 14 individuals with amusia and matched controls. Analogous adaptive-tracking procedures were used to generate <b>tone</b> and <b>digit</b> spans using stimuli that exceeded psychophysically measured pitch perception thresholds. Individuals with amusia had significantly smaller tone spans, whereas their digits spans were a similar size to those of controls. An automated operation span task was used to determine working memory capacity. Working memory deficits were seen in only a small subgroup of individuals with amusia. These findings support the existence of a pitch-specific component within short-term memory and suggest that congenital amusia is more than {{a disorder}} of fine-grained pitch discrimination...|$|R
30|$|When {{it comes}} to the {{temporary}} retention of nonlinguistic-auditory information such as tones, there is evidence for a highly specific type of auditory interference without a serial order memory component. Deutsch (1970) used a recognition procedure in which one tone was presented for memorization, followed by a retention interval of 5  s and the presentation of a test tone. The participants were instructed to ignore a sequence of six <b>tones</b> or <b>digits</b> presented during the retention interval. The results showed that only interpolated tones led to a higher rate of errors, while few errors occurred with interpolated digits. A subsequent study by Pechmann and Mohr (1992) employed a similar tone recognition procedure and compared retention intervals filled either with irrelevant tones, speech, or visual material, under both attended and unattended conditions. Interestingly, they also compared musicians and nonmusicians to investigate whether the findings could be generalized to populations differing in musical expertise. For both groups of participants, the irrelevant tones disrupted tone recognition in a similar way, but only for nonmusicians, the interpolated verbal (both attended and unattended conditions) and visual material (only attended condition) had disruptive effects, indicating that tone recognition was disrupted both by attentional and modal interference.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a second}} viewpoint: that of the {{telephone}} industry, where ISDN is a core technology. A telephone network {{can be thought of}} as a collection of wires strung between switching systems. The common electrical specification for the signals on these wires is T1 or E1. Between telephone company switches, the signaling is performed via SS7. Normally, a PBX is connected via a T1 with robbed bit signaling to indicate on-hook or off-hook conditions and MF and DTMF tones to encode the destination number. ISDN is much better because messages can be sent much more quickly than by trying to encode numbers as long (100 ms per <b>digit)</b> <b>tone</b> sequences. This results in faster call setup times. Also, a greater number of features are available and fraud is reduced.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a real-time multi-modal spiking Deep Neural Network (DNN) implemented on an FPGA platform. The hardware DNN system, called n-Minitaur, demonstrates a 4 -fold improvement in computational speed {{over the previous}} DNN FPGA system. The proposed system directly interfaces two different event-based sensors: a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) and a Dynamic Audio Sensor (DAS). The DNN for this bimodal hardware system is trained on the MNIST digit dataset {{and a set of}} unique audio <b>tones</b> for each <b>digit.</b> When tested on the spikes produced by each sensor alone, the classification accuracy is around 70 % for DVS spikes generated in response to displayed MNIST images, and 60 % for DAS spikes generated in response to noisy tones. The accuracy increases to 98 % when spikes from both modalities are provided simultaneously. In addition, the system shows a fast latency response of only 5 ms...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The pathogenetic {{hypotheses}} of Raynaud's phenomenon include increased {{activation of}} sympathetic noradrenergic nerves controlling muscle <b>tone</b> of <b>digit</b> arteriolar walls. Because acral sympathetic fibres contain vasoactive adrenergic and cholinergic fibres for sweat glands, we tested cholinergic sympathetic fibre function in primary Raynaud's phenomenon (PRP) patients by sympathetic skin response (SSR). METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive patients (19 women, 7 men, mean age 37. 8 years) with PRP were enroled prospectively. SSR {{was obtained by}} random electrical stimulation of the left ulnar nerve at the wrist recording from the palm (PSSR), third (M 3 SSR) and fifth fingers (U 5 SSR) on the right side. For each subject latency of shortest response, area of largest response and grand mean latencies and areas of 12 consecutive responses were calculated. The differences between patients and a control group (15 women, 6 men, mean age 38. 9 years) were calculated. SSR habituation was also compared between patients and controls. RESULTS: PSSRs were recorded in all patients and no difference in any PSSR parameter was found between patients and controls. U 5 SSRs and M 3 SSRs were absent in two patients. Grand mean area and mean of largest M 3 SSRs and U 5 SSRs were significantly lower in patients than in controls. Grand mean latency and mean of shortest M 3 SSRs and U 5 SSRs were significantly slower in patients than in controls. M 3 and U 5 SSRs habituated less in patients than in controls. INTERPRETATION: Dysregulation of cholinergic sympathetic fibres innervating the fingers was found in PRP. Abnormal peripheral mechanisms may be the cause. Since SSR habituation was also not normal, even central mechanisms may be implicate...|$|R
40|$|It {{is still}} {{unresolved}} whether individuals with dyslexia suffer non-verbal auditory processing deficits {{that may explain}} their phonological problems. Many {{studies have shown that}} dyslexic individuals are poor at discriminating pure tones, and this deficit has been attributed to impaired rapid auditory processing. In order to investigate the temporal properties of auditory processing in dyslexia, I have therefore studied the pure tone discrimination abilities of dyslexics, and then analysed the effects of varying interstimulus interval, the amount of frequency difference, and the effect of adding distractor tones during the interstimulus interval. In an investigation of dyslexic individuals’ ability to remember sequences of <b>tones</b> or <b>digits</b> (tonal and digit recognition memory), Rose and Rosner (2005) found that their results were affected by the education their subjects had received. The university educated dyslexics showed little tone discrimination deficit, whereas the dyslexic participants who never attended university showed greater deficits. Therefore, another aim of this thesis was to further study these findings and to identify any auditory processing compensatory mechanisms used by dyslexics who have received higher education. In eight different auditory tasks, the majority of which I programmed, I found strong evidence of non-verbal auditory processing deficits in dyslexic individuals. The comparison of university and non-university groups showed that educational differences had clear effects on many of their abilities, and should not be underestimated. The results showed that: In general, dyslexics had poorer auditory frequency discrimination than controls. Dyslexics who did not attend university had lower performance on almost all the auditory tests than the university dyslexic or control groups. Unexpectedly, university educated dyslexics were less distracted by interrupting tones during frequency discrimination than university educated controls. In a tone sequence memory task, the university educated dyslexics compensated in their performance to a level not much below that of the university educated controls, and above the controls who did not go to university. The frequency recognition tasks positively correlated with literacy abilities, and were independent of general intelligence. The strongest correlations were in the non-university dyslexic group. The implications of these results are that not only do dyslexic individuals suffer from a low level, non-linguistic, auditory processing deficit, but those who do not get to university are less able to compensate for these difficulties. It is impossible to say if the higher performance in university educated dyslexics was due to compensation, or if their presence at university was {{due to a lack of}} these deficits in the first place. Nevertheless, since university educated dyslexics were better at resisting distractions this may underlie their ability to compensate. These findings could facilitate the creation of new teaching methods to support the development of dyslexics’ compensatory skills and new non-linguistic diagnostic aids. These would help with identifying dyslexia in second languages and enable earlier testing and identification, before reading failure exerts its inevitable negative effects on children’s self-confidence, happiness and future academic potential.
