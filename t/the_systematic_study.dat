5|$|In {{early modern}} Europe, <b>the</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>study</b> of fossils {{emerged as an}} {{integral}} part of the changes in natural philosophy that occurred during the Age of Reason. In the Italian Renaissance, Leonardo Da Vinci made various significant contributions to the field as well designed numerous fossils. At the end of the 18th century Georges Cuvier's work established comparative anatomy as a scientific discipline and, by proving that some fossil animals resembled no living ones, demonstrated that animals could become extinct, leading to the emergence of paleontology. The expanding knowledge of the fossil record also played an increasing role in the development of geology, particularly stratigraphy.|$|E

The nature of fossils and their relationship to life in the past became better understood during the 17th and 18th centuries, and at the end of the 18th century the work of Georges Cuvier ended a long running debate about the reality of extinction and led to the emergence of paleontology, in association with comparative anatomy, as a scientific discipline.

5|$|This {{subfield}} {{of sociology}} studies, broadly, {{the dynamics of}} war, conflict resolution, peace movements, war refugees, conflict resolution and military institutions. As a subset of this subfield, military sociology aims towards <b>the</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>study</b> of the military as a social group {{rather than as an}} organization. It is a highly specialized sub-field which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with coerced collective action based on shared interests linked to survival in vocation and combat, with purposes and values that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns civilian-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies. Topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial-academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the institutional and organizational structure of military.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} the Moon's craters as impact {{features}} became widely accepted only in the 1940s.

That is, if a crater (or its ejecta) overlaid another, it must be the younger. The amount of erosion experienced by a crater was another clue to its age, though this is more subjective. Adopting this approach in the late 1950s, Gene Shoemaker took <b>the</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>study</b> of the Moon away from the astronomers and placed it firmly {{in the hands of the}} lunar geologists.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, {{there were two}} {{important}} developments in geometry. The {{first and most important}} was the creation of analytic geometry, or geometry with coordinates and equations, by René Descartes (1596–1650) and Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665). This was a necessary precursor to the development of calculus and a precise quantitative science of physics. The second geometric development of this period was <b>the</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>study</b> of projective geometry by Girard Desargues (1591–1661). Projective geometry is the study of geometry without measurement, just the study of how points align with each other. There had been some early work in this area by Hellenistic geometers, notably Pappus (c. 340). The greatest flowering of the field occurred with Jean-Victor Poncelet (1788–1867).|$|E

500|$|However, the {{achievements}} of the writers of the Corpus, the practitioners of Hippocratic medicine, and the actions of Hippocrates himself were often commingled; thus very little is known about what Hippocrates actually thought, wrote, and did.

He is also credited with greatly advancing <b>the</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>study</b> of clinical medicine, summing up the medical knowledge of previous schools, and prescribing practices for physicians through the Hippocratic Corpus and other works.|$|E

500|$|The {{late nineteenth}} century also brought <b>the</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>study</b> of color theory, and {{particularly}} the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other.

Describing his painting, The Night Cafe, to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: [...] "I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions. The hall is blood red and pale yellow, with a green billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon yellow, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens." ...|$|E
