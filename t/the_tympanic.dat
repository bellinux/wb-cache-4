5|$|The {{outer ear}} is the {{external}} {{portion of the}} ear and includes the fleshy visible pinna (also called the auricle), the ear canal, and the outer layer of the eardrum (also called <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> membrane).|$|E
5|$|Many nocturnal {{species have}} large, {{independently}} movable ears, {{although there are}} significant differences in sizes and shapes of the ear between species. The structure of the middle and inner ear of strepsirrhines differs between the lemurs and lorisoids. In lemurs, <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> cavity, which surrounds the middle ear, is expanded. This leaves the ectotympanic ring, which supports the eardrum, free within the auditory bulla. This trait is also seen in adapiforms. In lorisoids, however, <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> cavity is smaller and the ectotympanic ring becomes attached {{to the edge of}} the auditory bulla. <b>The</b> <b>tympanic</b> cavity in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces, which are not present in lemurs. Both lorisoids and cheirogaleid lemurs have replaced the internal carotid artery with an enlarged ascending pharyngeal artery. Strepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their tarsus (ankle bones) that differentiate them from haplorhines, such as a sloping talo-fibular facet (the face where the talus bone and fibula meet) and a difference in the location of the position of the flexor fibularis tendon on the talus. These differences give strepsirrhines the ability to make more complex rotations of the ankle and indicate that their feet are habitually inverted, or turned inward, an adaptation for grasping vertical supports.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} and its {{components}} develop {{from the first}} and second pharyngeal arches. <b>The</b> <b>tympanic</b> cavity and auditory tube develop from {{the first part of the}} pharyngeal pouch between the first two arches in an area which will also go on to develop the pharynx. This develops as a structure called the tubotympanic recess. The ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) normally appear during the first half of fetal development. The first two (malleus and incus) derive from the first pharyngeal arch and the stapes derives from the second. All three ossicles develop from the neural crest. Eventually cells from the tissue surrounding the ossicles will experience apoptosis and a new layer of endodermal epithelial will constitute the formation of <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> cavity wall.|$|E

5|$|The skull, {{which is}} short at the front, shows some typical oryzomyine characters. The palate is long, {{extending}} past the molars and the maxillary bones. The alisphenoid strut, {{which in some}} sigmodontines separates two foramina (openings) in the skull, is absent. The squamosal bone lacks a suspensory process contacting the tegmen tympani, the roof <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> cavity. The front part is short.|$|E
5|$|Another {{transitional}} {{feature of}} Dimetrodon is a ridge {{in the back}} of the jaw called the reflected lamina. The reflected lamina is found on the articular bone, which connects to the quadrate bone of the skull to form the jaw joint. In later mammal ancestors, the articular and quadrate separated from the jaw joint while the articular developed into the malleus bone of the middle ear. The reflected lamina became part of a ring called <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> annulus that supports the ear drum in all living mammals.|$|E
5|$|As the {{cochlear}} duct’s mesenchyme begins to differentiate, three cavities are formed: the scala vestibuli, the scala tympani and the scala media. Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani contain an extracellular fluid called perilymph. The scala media contains endolymph. A set of membranes called the vestibular membrane and the basilar membrane develop to separate {{the cochlear}} duct from the vestibular duct and <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> duct, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Primary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM), {{also known}} as glue ear, {{consists}} of a highly viscous mucus plug which fills the dog's middle ear and may cause <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> membrane to bulge. PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half of them. Because the pain and other sensations {{in the head and}} neck areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers which actually have PSOM and not SM.|$|E
5|$|The greater noctule bat has {{a robust}} skull and its rostrum is square with an {{ordinary}} nasal slit. The zygomatic arches are very slender and the braincase is smooth, turned upwards. The sagittal crest is not present, while the lambdoid crest is well developed. Most of the projecting {{point of the}} skull {{is made up of}} exoccipital condyles. The basisphenoid is wide and deep and <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> bullae are relatively small.|$|E
5|$|Other {{features}} of the skull distinguish the two genera. The tegmen tympani, the roof of <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> cavity, is much reduced in Voalavo relative to Eliurus. The subsquamosal fenestrae, openings in the squamosal bone {{at the back of}} the skull, are larger in Voalavo than in Eliurus. The zygomatic plate, a plate at the sides of the skull that roots the front part of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), is narrower in Voalavo, and lacks a clear zygomatic notch (a notch formed by a projection at the front of the zygomatic plate), which is present in Eliurus. Among nesomyines, only Brachytarsomys has a more reduced zygomatic notch.|$|E

5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} lies between the outer ear {{and the inner}} ear. It {{consists}} of an air-filled cavity called <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> cavity and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The ossicles are three small bones that function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The ossicles are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. The middle ear also connects to the upper throat at the nasopharynx via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.|$|E
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the ear canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal, as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region {{in front of the}} ear canal is called the concha. The ear canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> part of the temporal bone. The skin surrounding the ear canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. The ear canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E

5|$|In their {{descriptions}} of Plesiorycteropus, Lamberton and Patterson posited different {{interpretations of the}} location of the mandibular fossa, where the mandible (lower jaw) articulates with the cranium. MacPhee found problems with either interpretation and suggested that the true mandibular fossa was part of the area Lamberton identified as such, {{at the side of the}} braincase. The fossa is small and low, suggesting that the animal was not capable of powerful biting. At the back of this fossa is a pseudoglenoid proces, which is more prominent in P.germainepetterae. In P.germainepetterae but not P.madagascariensis, a small opening, perhaps the vascular foramen, is present next to the foramen ovale. The petrosal bone forms a relatively large portion of the roof of <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> cavity, which houses the middle ear; parts of the petrosal are more developed in P.madagascariensis. Endocasts (casts of the inside of the skull) indicate that the neopallium part of the brain was relatively small.|$|E
5|$|The {{back margin}} of the {{zygomatic}} plate is located close {{to the front of}} the upper first molar. The incisive foramina do not extend between the molars. Unlike in both Holochilus and Lundomys, the palate is flat, lacking a distinct ridge at the midline. The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the palate at the level of the molars, are excavated somewhat above the level of the palate. A strut of the alisphenoid bone is present, separating two openings in the skull, the masticatory–buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal, is present but small. The squamosal probably lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are medium in length, and do not reach the first molars. Their back margin is angular, not rounded as in eastern voalavo. The diastema (the gap between the upper incisors and molars) is shorter than in eastern voalavo. The bony palate is broad and lacks notable ridges and other features, except {{for a pair of}} foramina (openings) near the place where the first and second molars (M1 and M2) meet. The back border of the palate is {{at the level of the}} middle of the third molars (M3). In the bony roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind the palate, wide sphenopalatine vacuities (openings) are present. A thin alisphenoid strut (a piece of bone on the lower side of the skull separating two foramina) is present in specimens from Marojejy, but not in those from Anjanaharibe-Sud. The tegmen tympani, the roof of <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> cavity, is reduced.|$|E

50|$|The {{vestibule}} is {{the central}} part of the bony labyrinth in the inner ear, and is situated medial to <b>the</b> eardrum (<b>tympanic</b> cavity), behind <b>the</b> cochlea, and in front of the semicircular canals.|$|R
5|$|The incisive foramina, {{openings}} in the front part of the palate, reach backward between the molars. The palate is long, extending substantially beyond the third molars, the usual condition in oryzomyines. The back part, near the third molars, is usually perforated by prominent posterolateral palatal pits, which are recessed into fossae (depressions). Sphenopalatine vacuities are usually absent, but {{have been reported in}} some populations. There is no alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone that in some oryzomyines separates two foramina in the skull. The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening in the back part of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal bone, is present. The squamosal lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines. There are some {{openings in}} the mastoid bone.|$|E

5|$|The mysticete ear {{is adapted}} for hearing underwater, {{where it can}} hear sound {{frequencies}} as low as 7 Hz and as high as 22 kHz. It is largely unknown how sound is received by baleen whales. Unlike in toothed whales, sound does not pass through the lower jaw. The auditory meatus is blocked by connective tissue and an ear plug, which connects to the eardrum. The inner-ear bones are contained in <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> bulla, a bony capsule. However, this {{is attached to the}} skull, suggesting that vibrations passing through the bone is important. Sinuses may reflect vibrations towards the cochlea. It is known that when the fluid inside the cochlea is disturbed by vibrations, it triggers sensory hairs which send electrical current to the brain, where vibrations are processed into sound.|$|E
