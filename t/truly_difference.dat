40|$|As {{there is}} a lack of {{evidence}} attesting the equivalent item functioning across genders for the most employed instruments used to measure pathological gambling in adolescence, the present study was aimed to test the gender invariance of the Gambling Behavior Scale for Adolescents (GBS-A), a new measurement tool to assess the severity of Gambling Disorder (GD) in adolescents. The equivalence of the items across genders was assessed by analyzing Differential Item Functioning within an Item Response Theory framework. The GBS-A was administered to 1, 723 adolescents, and the graded response model was employed. The results attested the measurement equivalence of the GBS-A when administered to male and female adolescent gamblers. Overall, findings provided evidence that the GBS-A is an effective measurement tool of the severity of GD in male and female adolescents and that the scale was unbiased and able to relieve <b>truly</b> gender <b>differences.</b> As such, the GBS-A can be profitably used in educational interventions and clinical treatments with young people...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle and Nuclear Cardiology occurred simultaneously in 1925 - 1927. Thirty years later the Anger gamma camera would allow for a more sophisticated radioactive isotope counting to determine {{the presence or absence}} of disease. When employed with technetium- 99 m isotopes, ischemic heart disease can be inferred by differences in visual appearance of cardiac images. These gestalts of imaging results have been separated from the quantitative information recorded by the cameras computer. We investigated whether current camera and computer systems are sophisticated enough to quantify differences between images to be clinically relevant. Our study demonstrated that efforts to &#x 22;sharpen&#x 22; image appearance does so at a reduction in &#x 22;accuracy&#x 22;. Like Heisenberg, this work shows that one cannot know the exact location AND the amount of activity simultaneously and that a decision must be made for accuracy over image sharpness if one is to <b>truly</b> quantify <b>differences</b> in isotope concentration between images...|$|R

In this study, 10 μm polystyrene microspheres were adsorbed with one of three different proteins, human serum albumin (HSA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and hemoglobin. Spheres coated with HSA were then mixed with spheres coated with either BSA (a very similar protein) or hemoglobin (a dramatically different protein), and deposited on silicon substrates. Fluorescent labeling was used to verify the SIMS results. With maximum autocorrelation factors (MAF) processing, images showed clear contrast between both the very different proteins (HSA and hemoglobin) and the very similar proteins (HSA and BSA). Similar results were obtained with and without the fluorescent labels. MAF images were calculated using both the full spectrum and only characteristic amino acid fragments.

Lastly, I formulate the idea under consideration, namely that everyday life implies or underlies a certain metaphysics. I note that it is an implicit metaphysics – not expressed formally – and rather free. Embraced in experience with a certain degree of freedom, it is recognisable by means of certain representations active in our mind, by the manner of speaking or of understanding and by the common forms of expression. Its vibrancy, concrete and relaxed character makes it highly evocative of the mental life of an era. It ensures a <b>truly</b> essential <b>difference</b> in our everyday mode of being...|$|R

40|$|Children are not small adults. However, {{the main}} thesis of this review {{will be that}} children's {{responses}} to drugs {{have much in common}} with the responses in adults and indeed in other mammals. Often, it is assumed that drug effects differ in children but in reality this perception often arises because the drugs have not been adequately studied in paediatric populations of different ages and with different diseases. There may also be difficulties in measuring small but significant effects because the outcome measures are more difficult to assess in children. In some cases, stage of development can alter the action of, and response to, a drug – a <b>truly</b> age-dependent <b>difference</b> in pharmacodynamics. This may be true of both the desired action and adverse events. Examples are given. Programming by drugs is also a phenomenon almost exclusive to early life, i. e. permanent effects result from a stimulus applied at a sensitive point in development (‘critical window’), often in fetal or neonatal life. Again, examples are discussed. Different pathophysiology, different disease variants, different pharmacodynamics, different ‘host’ response and different adverse drug reactions can all explain why some drugs behave differently in children. However, we need to explore ways to avoid re-inventing the wheel by determining how data from adult animal and human models can help inform research and practice for children...|$|R

Research efforts have increased and many reports on various aspects of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in women have been published highlighting sex differences in pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment of IHD. Data, however, remain limited. A description of the state of the science, with recognition of the shortcomings of current data, is necessary to guide future research and move the field forward. In this report, we identify gaps in existing literature and make recommendations for future research. Women largely share similar cardiovascular risk factors for IHD with men; however, women with suspected or confirmed IHD have less coronary atherosclerosis than men, even though they are older and have more cardiovascular risk factors than men. Coronary endothelial dysfunction and microvascular disease have been proposed as important determinants in the aetiology and prognosis of IHD in women, but research is limited on whether sex differences in these mechanisms <b>truly</b> exist. <b>Differences</b> in the epidemiology of IHD between women and men remain largely unexplained, as we are still unable to explain why women are protected towards IHD until older age compared with men.

40|$|Here {{we present}} a {{comparative}} study of stable carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) isotope data from 81 individuals from the catastrophic death assemblage at Herculaneum (79 CE) and compare these with the attritional sites of Velia (Salerno, Italy, 1 st– 2 nd century CE) and Isola Sacra (Rome, Italy, 1 st– 2 nd century AD). The instantaneous deposition of the Herculaneum assemblage highlights some interesting differences in our contextual and methodological understanding of stable dietary isotopes, suggesting that isotopic variation between sites may sometimes {{be a result of}} greater temporal variability rather than <b>truly</b> comparable <b>differences.</b> Our results suggest that the people of Herculaneum obtained a relatively small proportion (ca. 30 %) of their dietary carbon from marine foods; the majority originating from terrestrial foodstuffs of a similar carbon isotopic composition, most likely cereals. Also observed is a generally greater dietary isotopic enrichment in male individuals than females. We infer that males had greater access to fish which may be reflective, in part, of the sociodemographic framework characteristic of Roman society. Finally, we highlight the methodological challenges which may be faced when undertaking comparisons of δ 13 C and δ 15 N data between the various age-related strata of a population, particularly due to the slow and variable rate of collagen turnover...|$|R

The UK Department of Health has used three cost indices to benchmark NHS hospitals (Trusts).

The paper concludes that the methods each have particular strengths and weaknesses and potentially measure different aspects of efficiency. Several specifications should be used to develop ranges of inefficiency to act as signalling devices rather than point estimates. It is argued that differences in efficiency scores across different methods may be due to random noise and reflect data deficiencies.
