5|$|Oberlin’s {{compensation}} policies required Stone to do {{twice the}} labor a male student {{had to do}} to pay the same costs.

When her request was denied, she resigned her position. Pleading with <b>the</b> <b>faculty</b> to restore Stone, her former students said they would pay Stone “what was right” if the college would not. Stone had planned to borrow money from her father when funds ran out, but Francis Stone, moved by his daughter’s description of her struggles, promised to provide money when needed. Help from home was not needed, however, because after three months of pressure, <b>the</b> <b>faculty</b> yielded and hired Stone back, paying both her and other women student teachers at the same rate paid male student teachers.|$|E
