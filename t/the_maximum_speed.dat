5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear on its hind legs. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fariña (1999), who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which is adapted to galloping.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>maximum</b> design <b>speed</b> of {{high speed}} trains is the maximal speed {{the train is}} {{operating}} in regular traffic. Due to certification and testing purposes <b>the</b> real <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> is higher. Historically <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> design <b>speed</b> was understood as a constant value, which is depending on factors like distance to be travelled between two stops, traffic volume, energy cost etc. The study to be presented here aims to show, that <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> design <b>speed</b> is a variable value depending as well on factors as willingness to pay, which is again depending on variables like airplane ticket prices or even petrol prices...|$|R
25|$|The {{design speed}} is 300km/h. <b>The</b> planned <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> was {{initially}} 250km/h {{and was later}} raised to 300km/h.

5|$|Enzyme rates {{depend on}} {{solution}} conditions and substrate concentration. To find <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This {{is shown in}} the saturation curve on the right. Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, {{more and more of the}} free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES complex. At the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES complex is the same as the total amount of enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{it appears}} that Iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier; {{juvenile}} I. bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults (60% of hindlimb length versus 70% for adults). When walking as a quadruped, the animal's hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other, as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus's arms and hands. The three toed pes (foot) of Iguanodon was relatively long, and when walking, both the hand and the foot would {{have been used in}} a digitigrade fashion (walking on the fingers and toes). <b>The</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of Iguanodon has been estimated at , which would have been as a biped; {{it would not have been}} able to gallop as a quadruped.|$|E
5|$|The peak random write {{performance}} on an SSD {{is driven by}} plenty of free blocks after the SSD is completely garbage collected, secure erased, 100% TRIMed, or newly installed. <b>The</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> will depend upon the number of parallel flash channels connected to the SSD controller, {{the efficiency of the}} firmware, and the speed of the flash memory in writing to a page. During this phase the write amplification will be the best it can ever be for random writes and will be approaching one. Once the blocks are all written once, garbage collection will begin and the performance will be gated by the speed and efficiency of that process. Write amplification in this phase will increase to the highest levels the drive will experience.|$|E

5|$|Some H-3 and H-4s were {{equipped}} with barrage balloon cable-cutting {{equipment in the}} shape of cutter installations forward of the engines and cockpit. They were designated H-8, but later named H8/R2. These aircraft were difficult to fly and production stopped. The H-6 initiated some overall improvements in design. The Jumo 211 F-1 engine of 1,007kW (1,350hp) increased its speed while the defensive armament was upgraded with one 20mm MG FF cannon in the nose position, one MG 15 in the ventral turret, and in each of the fuselage side windows (optional). Some H-6 variants carried tail-mounted MG 17 defensive armament. The performance of the H-6 was much improved. The climb rate was higher and the machine could reach a slightly higher ceiling of 8,500 m (27,200ft). When heavy bomb loads were added, this ceiling was reduced to 6,500 m (20,800ft). The weight of the H-6 increased to 14,000kg (30,600lb). Some H-6s received Jumo 211F-2s which improved a low-level speed of 226mph (365km/h). At an altitude of 6,000 m (19,200ft) <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> was 270mph (435km/h). If heavy external loads were added, the speed was reduced by 21.75mph (35km/h).|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, saboteurs caused a fire on Triglav, further eroding crew morale already under {{pressure}} from desertion. Elsewhere in the Bay of Kotor, Milan Spasić and Sergej Mašera died blowing up the destroyer Zagreb to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. Following this, Kern decided to sail out with just two boats, Durmitor and Kajmakčalan, which he deemed had the most trustworthy crews, leaving the Bay of Kotor on 17 April. Because both boats were in poor condition and overloaded with personnel, <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> they could achieve was 29 knots. Before passing through the Strait of Otranto, the boats successfully evaded two groups of Italian ships. They arrived at Navarino Bay in southern Greece on 19 April and at Souda Bay in Crete on 22 April, where they were tasked with escorting a convoy to Alexandria, protecting it from possible attacks from Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombers. Once in Alexandria, they joined with other JKRM vessels and aircraft that had managed to escape, forming the JKRM in exile. The two boats were first tasked with patrolling {{the outside of the}} harbour in anticipation of an attack by Axis coastal craft. In June they operated against Vichy French forces in Syria. In 1944 they were reported as being tasked with escorting convoys between Alexandria and Port Said. However, with time the serviceability of the boats became a problem {{because of the lack of}} spare parts needed for their German-built engines.|$|E

30|$|As can be seen, the speeds {{ranging from}} 200 to 320  km/h {{coincide}} {{with each other}} for many HS trains. Nevertheless, generally, with the increase of <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> design <b>speed,</b> <b>the</b> positive difference between this and <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> operating <b>speed</b> tends to increase. This particularly happens for the speeds ranging between 270 and 380  km/h. Consequently, at particularly high <b>maximum</b> design <b>speeds</b> (above 300  km/h), it is likely to expect <b>the</b> lower <b>maximum</b> operating <b>speeds</b> for about 10  %– 20  %, as shown in this case.|$|R
50|$|Caution {{is needed}} when {{considering}} <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>speeds</b> of Italian warships of this period, since Italian practice {{was to run}} the trials with ships as light as possible, often without armament.

40|$|Purpose. Studies of {{the effect}} of {{aerodynamic}} pressure on <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> permissible <b>speeds</b> of a high-speed train on the existing railway infrastructure. Methodology. The study of the magnitude and direction of the aerodynamic pressure, its effect on <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>speeds</b> of a high-speed train was carried out on a train model composed of axisymmetric bodies with conical forms of head and tail parts. Findings. Determined the values of the aerodynamic pressure at different distances from the train are, when the high-speed train moves at a speed of 200 km/h or more. <b>The</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>speeds</b> of a high-speed train are determined taking into account the state of the infrastructure of the existing railway, ensuring the safe operation of a high-speed railway. Originality. Theoretical studies of aerodynamic pressure from secondary air currents formed during the movement of high-speed trains are performed on a model of a train composed of identical axisymmetric bodies with conical forms of head and tail moving in a compressible medium. The results of the research allow the regularity of the change in aerodynamic pressure during the movement of a high-speed train. Practical value. The obtained results allow to establish: 1) <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> permissible <b>speeds</b> of a high-speed train taking into account the technical condition of permanent devices and structures of the existing railway infrastructure; 2) technical parameters of individual objects and structural elements of the infrastructure of high-speed iron subjected to the effect of aerodynamic pressure for a given <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of high-speed trains...|$|R
