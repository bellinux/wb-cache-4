Each player who can fulfill <b>the</b> <b>Wished</b> card must play it, if possible, until it is played once—if <b>the</b> <b>wished</b> card requires you playing four of them as a Bomb (i.e. to beat the straight, above), you must.

If a straight can only be constructed with the Phoenix (as wild card, not <b>the</b> <b>wished</b> value), you must play it. Remember: if you can, you must.
