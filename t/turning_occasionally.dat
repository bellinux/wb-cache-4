60|$|With this dire threat, and <b>turning</b> <b>occasionally</b> {{to bestow}} another fierce glance upon the steward, {{she walked to}} the door and, opening it to its full extent, closed it behind her with a crash and darted across the alley to her own house. The two men gazed at each other without speaking, and then Mr. Wilks, {{stepping}} over to the door, turned the key in the lock.|$|E
60|$|Malchus {{could now}} clearly see the lions approaching. They were {{advancing}} slowly, <b>turning</b> <b>occasionally</b> {{to look back}} as if reluctant to quit {{the shelter of the}} hills; and Malchus could hardly resist a start of uneasiness as one of them suddenly gave vent to a deep, threatening roar, so menacing and terrible that the very leaves of the trees seemed to quiver {{in the light of the}} moon under its vibrations. The lions seemed of huge dimensions, especially the leader of the troop, who stalked with a steady and majestic step at their head. When within fifty yards of the grove the lions suddenly paused; their leader apparently scented danger. Again the deep terrible roar rose in the air, answered by an angry snarling noise on the part of the females.|$|E
6000|$|She came on steadily, {{moving with}} {{astonishing}} silence through the tangle, till she stood where I {{had been a}} moment before, when she started violently and threw her head up into the wind. Some scent of me was there, clinging faintly to the leaves and the moist earth. For a moment she stood like a rock, sifting the air in her nose; then, finding nothing in the wind, she turned slowly in my direction to use her ears and eyes. I was lying very still behind a mossy log by this time, {{and she did not}} see me. Suddenly she turned and called, a low bleat. There was an instant stir in the spruce den, an answering bleat, and a moose calf scrambled out and ran straight to the mother. There was an unvoiced command to silence that no human sense could understand. The mother put her great head down to earth--"Smell of that; mark that, and remember," [...] she was saying in her own way; and the calf put his little head down beside hers, and I heard him sniff-sniffing the leaves. Then the mother swung her head savagely, bunted the little fellow out of his tracks, and drove him hurriedly ahead of her away from the place--"Get out, hurry, danger!" [...] was what she was saying now, and emphasizing her teaching with an occasional bunt from behind that lifted the calf over the hard places. So they went up the hill, the calf wondering and curious, yet ever reminded by the hard head at his flank that obedience was his business just now, the mother <b>turning</b> <b>occasionally</b> to sniff and listen, till they vanished silently among the dark spruces.|$|E

50|$|Street biased riders tend {{to choose}} disk brakes more often. Part {{of this is}} that disks are almost {{invariably}} better at controlling the speed of a bike while it is rolling, that is they can take more energy per unit time from the rider (i.e. they have more power, which is why they dominate all other off-road cycling disciplines), but most disks will not hold a wheel locked as firmly as a rim brake, making them less desirable for competition trials. Rim brakes set up for trials tend to squeal or howl if they are pulled while the wheel is <b>turning,</b> <b>occasionally</b> leading to trials riders attracting undesirable attention or being considered a nuisance for noise pollution.|$|E

6000|$|... "Sounds marvellously like {{domestic}} fowls," [...] said Dominick, as {{he pushed}} forward. And such {{it turned out to}} be, for, on reaching an open glade in the thicket, they beheld a large flock of hens running on ahead of them, with a splendid cock bringing up the rear, which <b>turned</b> <b>occasionally</b> to cast an indignant look at the intruders.|$|R

2500|$|In June 1901, Elizabeth married Henry Symes Lehr (1869–1929), aka Harry Lehr. The {{marriage}} was never consummated. On her wedding night, she was informed {{by her husband}} that he loathed her and could not stand the thought of touching her ever, although {{he wanted her to}} understand she was to be cordial to him in public and he might in <b>turn</b> <b>occasionally</b> call her [...] "darling". He had, he admitted, married her for her money because poverty terrified him.|$|R

Well, I can tell you I {{have never had a}} more {{promising}} pupil, and I have brought forward two or three of the best men in the ring; no wonder that Jack cannot do much with you.

5000|$|In preparation, {{corn meal}} {{may or may}} not be scalded with hot water or hot milk in {{accordance}} to preference. After mixing meal with water or milk it is dropped on a smoking hot spider pan set atop a stove into cakes about 3"x3"x1/2" [...] in size. The secret of cooking jonny cakes is to watch them closely and keep them supplied with enough sausage or bacon fat so they will become crisp, and not burn. Cook slowly for half an hour, <b>turn</b> <b>occasionally,</b> and when done serve with plenty of butter.|$|R

50|$|Despite several {{comeback}} attempts, {{the knee}} injury forced Davies {{to retire in}} October 1900. In 1908, he had recovered sufficiently to enable him to <b>turn</b> out <b>occasionally</b> for his village team.|$|R

50|$|During {{the time}} of the First World War, {{manufacturing}} processes typically became more complex with larger numbers of workers being supervised. This period saw the widespread introduction of mass production and piece work, which created problems as workmen could now earn more money by the production of extra products, which in <b>turn</b> <b>occasionally</b> led to poor quality workmanship being passed on to the assembly lines. To counter bad workmanship, full-time inspectors were introduced to identify, quarantine and ideally correct product quality failures. Quality control by inspection in the 1920s and 1930s led to the growth of quality inspection functions, separately organized from production and large enough to be headed by superintendents.|$|R
25|$|In 2013, 2015 and 2017, {{two or more}} wooden roller {{coasters}} with inversions opened. As opposed to the vertical loop that Son of Beast had, Outlaw Run and Hades 360, Mine Blower and Twisted Colossus have more complex inversions. Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City has a double barrel roll and a 153° over-banked turn, and Hades 360 has a single corkscrew. Other elements which partially invert riders, such as the overbanked <b>turn</b> which <b>occasionally</b> <b>turn</b> riders beyond 90 degrees, are not typically considered inversions.|$|R
