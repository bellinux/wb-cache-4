5|$|Cleveland {{started the}} season with a 1–6 record, {{recording}} its first win against the Bengals in October and snapping an 11-game losing streak stretching back to the previous season. After the game, NFL owners approved the sale of the team by Lerner <b>to</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Haslam, a truck-stop magnate, for about $1 billion.

5|$|Gregg Allman became {{interested}} in the Hammond after Mike Finnigan had introduced him <b>to</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Smith's music, and started to write material with it. His brother Duane specifically requested he play the instrument when forming the Allman Brothers Band, and he was presented with a brand new B-3 and Leslie 122RV upon joining. Allman recalls the instrument was cumbersome to transport, particularly on flights of stairs, which often required the whole band's assistance. Author Frank Moriarty considers Allman's Hammond playing a vital ingredient of the band's sound.|$|E
5|$|In the new year, O'Sullivan {{failed to}} reach the quarter-final stages of a ranking event {{for the first time}} this season: losing 4–5 to Joe Swail in the last 16. This began a run of poor form that saw O'Sullivan lose in the opening round of the Masters 2–6 <b>to</b> <b>Jimmy</b> White and then in the second round of the Thailand Masters 4–5 to Shokat Ali (losing the {{deciding}} frame on a re-spotted black). O'Sullivan returned to winning ways, by capturing the Irish Masters title by defeating Stephen Hendry 9–8 in the final, before he experienced another dip in form losing to Mark Davis in opening round of the Scottish Open.|$|E
5|$|LeDuc {{made his}} AWA {{television}} debut on August 2, 1975 defeating Angel Rivera. LeDuc was given wins over Buddy Wolff and Boris Breznikoff (Nicolai Volkoff) before forming {{the team with}} Larry Hennig. Leduc and Hennig first teamed on September 12, 1975 in Denver, Colorado losing <b>to</b> <b>Jimmy</b> and Johnny Valiant. Leduc and Hennig feuded with the Valiant Brothers for several months before entering a feud with Baron Von Raschke and Mad Dog Vachon. Jos and Larry also received a few title shots against AWA tag champs Blackjack Lanza and Bobby Duncum in August 1976. Probably his most memorable accomplishment while working for the promotion was a bus-pulling stunt filmed in Minneapolis that was also used in promo videos while appearing in the Memphis and Atlanta territories, among others.

5|$|On March 27, London and Kendrick made an {{appearance}} in Dragon Gate USA, where Kendrick had already appeared in singles competition. However, their {{run as a}} tag team in the company was short-lived due to losing a Pinfall Loser Leaves Company match <b>to</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Jacobs and Jack Evans {{and as a result}} Kendrick, who tapped out to Jacobs, was forced to leave the company for good. They reunited once again on October 4, 2012, at the first Family Wrestling Entertainment's PPV, Back 2 Brooklyn. They, along with Jay Lethal, defeated the team of The Young Bucks and Petey Williams. London and Kendrick defeated The Young Bucks when they wrestled again on October 6, 2012, at the House of Hardcore's first show.

5|$|Revie had {{improved}} his goal tally to 13 in the 1953–54 season, but only once the Revie Plan was {{implemented in the}} 1954–55 campaign were Manchester City able to fully make use of his abilities. The new tactic opened with a 5–0 defeat to Preston North End, but then Ken Barnes replaced John McTavish at inside-forward and the team clicked. Though the tactic was named after Revie, it had initially been introduced at reserve team level by Johnny Williamson, though Revie's superior passing talents meant Williamson was overlooked for the position at first team level. City's league title campaign fell away but {{they went on to}} reach the 1955 FA Cup Final at Wembley, where they were beaten 3–1 by Newcastle United; a first-half injury <b>to</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Meadows left City down to ten men and unable to compete effectively. At {{the end of the season}} Revie was named as FWA Footballer of the Year.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies scored {{first for}} the second game {{in a row in}} the second inning; Raúl Ibañez hit a ground rule double, and a Matt Stairs single off of A. J. Burnett drove him in. It was the only run allowed by the New York {{pitching}} staff. Mark Teixeira tied the game with a solo home run in the fourth inning, and Hideki Matsui broke the tie in the sixth with another, giving the Yankees their first lead. Chan Ho Park allowed an RBI single to Jorge Posada after Martínez put two baserunners on {{in the top of the}} seventh. Burnett departed after seven innings, replaced by Mariano Rivera in the eighth. The Phillies put two runners on with a walk <b>to</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Rollins and a single by Shane Victorino with one out in the eighth. However, Chase Utley grounded into an inning-ending double play ending on a close play at first base that drew controversy. Rivera completed the ninth inning for his 38th postseason save.|$|E

5000|$|Jimmy's {{letters and}} {{telegram}} are being intercepted {{by the federal}} agents in the post office. Van Alden is furious at Agent Sebso for misplacing the telegram sent <b>to</b> Nucky by <b>Jimmy,</b> which would have enabled them <b>to</b> arrest <b>Jimmy</b> as he arrived from Chicago. Van Alden plans <b>to</b> use <b>Jimmy's</b> guilt in the truck heist to coerce his testimony against Nucky's corruption. Meanwhile, Jimmy visits his mother Gillian's apartment, where she has Lucky Luciano fooled and unarmed in bed. Before Jimmy can take Luciano away, Van Alden arrives <b>to</b> arrest <b>Jimmy.</b> He denies involvement in the truck heist, but in jail sees his old accomplice Billy Winslow, whom he thinks may have confessed.
