5|$|Although {{setting the}} state budget is a {{legislative}} function in many states, Kentucky governors are required by statute to present a proposed biennial budget to the General Assembly for approval shortly after the beginning of its even-year sessions. The governor's budget has often been approved with few changes, but since the Republicans {{took control of the}} state senate {{for the first time in}} 1999, approval has become a much more contentious process. The General Assembly failed <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> budget before the end of its session in both 2002 and 2004. In both cases, the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by the governor until the legislature could re-convene and pass a budget. In 2005 the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the governor had no authority to expend funds without legislative approval, and that if legislators failed <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> budget in the future, only expenditures explicitly authorized in the state constitution could be made.|$|E

5|$|In 1791, Congress {{passed a}} {{resolution}} authorizing President George Washington to establish a mint.

The result was the Mint Act of 1792, which prescribed the specifications of the new US coins, the highest denomination being the eagle, or ten-dollar piece.|$|E

5|$|In 1846, Dow spoke {{before the}} {{legislature}} {{in favor of}} statewide prohibition. The bill passed, but lacked the enforcement mechanisms necessary to give it effect. The following year, {{he ran for the}} state legislature in a special election, but was narrowly defeated. In 1850, now a member of the new Free Soil Party, he encouraged like-minded legislators <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> stronger prohibition law. They did so, but saw it vetoed by Democratic governor John W. Dana. The legislature fell one vote short of overriding the veto.|$|E

A Solidarity call for new elections went unheeded, but the Sejm still managed <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> resolution condemning the 1981 martial law (despite the SLD voting against). Meanwhile, the left-wing OPZZ trade union had acquired 2.5 million members, {{twice as many}} as the contemporary Solidarity (with 1.3 million).|$|E
5|$|In earlier times, when large {{populations of}} {{springbok}} roamed the Kalahari desert and Karoo, millions of migrating springbok formed herds hundreds of kilometres long {{that could take}} several days <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> town. These mass treks, known as trekbokken in Afrikaans, took place during long periods of drought. Herds could efficiently retrace their paths to their territories after long migrations. Trekbokken is still observed occasionally in Botswana, though on a much smaller scale than earlier.|$|E

5|$|On 9 February 1733, Faulkner advertised {{his future}} {{publication}} of Swift's collected works in four volumes in the Dublin Journal.

The English, in 1735, attempted <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> law that would allow a copyright holder to prohibit works that may violate their copyright, but this law failed to pass through Parliament.|$|E

5|$|After {{his tenure}} in Congress, Rowan {{was elected to}} {{represent}} Nelson County in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1813 to 1817. In 1817, the House debated a resolution instructing Governor Gabriel Slaughter {{to negotiate with the}} governors of Indiana and Ohio to secure passage of legislation requiring citizens of those states to return fugitive slaves. Representative James G. Birney vigorously opposed the resolution, and it was defeated. The pro-slavery members of the House then rallied behind Rowan's leadership <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> substitute resolution which softened the most objectionable language but retained the call for fugitive slave legislation in Indiana and Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Anna Beauchamp {{joined her}} husband in his cell in the dungeon; the only entry was through a trap door {{at the top of}} the room. During their incarceration, they tried to bribe a guard into {{allowing}} them to escape. When that failed, they tried <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> letter to Senator Beauchamp asking for help to escape, an attempt which likewise failed. Both the senator and the younger Beauchamp asked for a pardon from Governor Desha, but to no avail. Beauchamp's final request to Desha for a stay of execution was rejected July 5, 1826. With the last hope exhausted, the couple attempted a double suicide by drinking a vial of laudanum which Anna had smuggled into the cell. Both survived. The following morning, Jereboam and Anna were put on suicide watch and threatened with separation.|$|E
