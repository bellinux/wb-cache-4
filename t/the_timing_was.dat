On the 31st, Ramphele stated {{that she would not}} take up DA party membership and would remain the leader of Agang South Africa, resulting in confusion. On 2 February, Helen Zille stated that Ramphele had reneged on her agreement to stand as the DA's presidential candidate. Ramphele subsequently apologised for the reversal of her decision, saying that <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> not right as the reaction to it had shown people were unable to overcome race-based party politics.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Hartley began brewing in Tadcaster in 1758. In 1845 Jane Hartley mortgaged {{the brewery}} to David Backhouse and John Hartley. In 1847, Samuel Smith of Leeds {{arranged}} {{for his son}} John to enter the business. Jane Hartley died in 1852, and John Smith acquired the business, enlisting his brother William to help him. <b>The</b> <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> to prove fortuitous; pale ales were displacing porter as the beer of choice, and Tadcaster's hard water proved to be well-suited for brewing the new style. The prosperity of the 1850s and 1860s, together {{with the arrival of}} the railways, realised greater opportunities for brewers, and by 1861 John Smith employed eight men in his brewing and malting enterprise.|$|E
5|$|The uprising's {{timing was}} fixed at 17 July, at 5:00p.m.; this was {{agreed to by}} {{the leader of the}} Carlists, Manuel Fal Condé. However, <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> changed: the men in Spanish Morocco were to rise up at 5:00a.m. and those in Spain itself {{starting}} exactly a day later, so control of Spanish Morocco could be achieved and forces sent to Iberia from Morocco to coincide with the risings there. The rising was intended to be a swift coup d'état, but the government retained control of most of the country.|$|E

5|$|By early 1799, the French Directory {{had become}} {{impatient}} with stalling tactics employed by Austria. The uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany. At {{the beginning of}} 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced {{each other across the}} Rhine. Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance (Bodensee) to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} in Weekly Shōnen Jumps Naruto Anime Profiles Episodes 1-37, Masashi Kishimoto stated that he enjoys drawing Lee {{more than any other}} character in the series. When designing Lee's appearance, Kishimoto intended to have Lee wield a variety of weapons, including nunchaku; however, due to time constraints while creating the series, he was unable to do so. Kishimoto's first editor, Kosuke Yahagi, originally drew the author a draft of Lee's appearance. While the design highly changed from its draft to the original one when Kishimoto designed it, Yahagi felt pleased because some parts were kept. Kishimoto has noted that he originally designed Lee to symbolize human weakness; Kishimoto's design of Sakura Haruno was also intended to carry the same symbolism. Kishimoto was surprised by Lee's popularity within fans. He intended to write more about him but <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> never right. Due to the popularity Lee garnered {{over the course of the}} series, Kishimoto tends to place him towards the front of promotional artwork in which he appears.|$|E
5|$|The RSGS {{supported}} these proposals, {{as did the}} Royal Society of Edinburgh, the University of Edinburgh, {{and other}} Scottish organisations. However, <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> wrong; the Royal Geographical Society in London was fully occupied with Captain Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, and showed no interest in Bruce's plans. No rich private benefactors came forward, and persistent and intensive lobbying of the government for financial backing failed. Bruce suspected that his efforts were, as usual, being undermined by the aged but still influential Markham. Finally accepting that his venture would not take place, he gave generous support and advice to Ernest Shackleton, who in 1913 announced plans, similar to Bruce's, for his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. Shackleton not only received £10,000 from the government, but raised large sums from private sources, including £24,000 from Scottish industrialist Sir James Caird of Dundee.|$|E

5|$|The new work, {{like its}} predecessor, {{attracted}} minimal readership. On 21 June 1791, {{just days after}} it was published, all attention became focused on King Louis XVI's ill-fated flight to Varennes, and Saint-Just's theories about constitutional monarchy were made suddenly irrelevant. Yet the episode had another effect – it fostered a public anger toward the king which simmered all year until finally a Parisian mob attacked the Tuileries Palace on 10 August 1792. In response, the Assembly declared itself ready to step down ahead of schedule {{and called for a}} new election, this one under universal male suffrage. <b>The</b> <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> excellent for Saint-Just, who turned the legal age of twenty-five {{before the end of the}} month. The fear inspired by the invasion of the Tuileries made most of his opponents retire from the scene, and Saint-Just was elected as one of the deputies for the département of Aisne. He left for Paris to join the National Convention as its youngest member.|$|E
