40|$|The {{background}} of the study in this research are many students {{in junior high school}} have difficulties to memorize the meaning of adverb of frequency and they still confuse to use adverb of frequency in right position. Because the teacher just explain the material using speech and students listen it monotonously. The use of memory round game as a media can be a choice for the teacher in teaching adverb of frequency in different way. This study only focuses on teaching adverb of frequency by using memory round game as the media. And the problems in this study can be stated as follow: 1. 	How is the implementation of memory round game to improve students’ understanding on adverb of frequency at <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>grades</b> students of MTs NU 07 Patebon Kendal? 2. 	How much does memory round game improve students’ understanding on adverb of frequency at <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>grades</b> students of MTs NU 07 Patebon Kendal? The objectives of this study were to describe the implementation of using memory round game in teaching adverb of frequency at <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>grades</b> students of MTs NU 07 Patebon Kendal and to identify how much memory round game’ improves students’ understanding on adverb of frequency at <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>grades</b> students of MTs NU 07 Patebon Kendal. The subjects of this study were the students of MTs NU 07 Patebon Kendal in the academic year of 2009 / 2010. The number of the subjects was 40 students. This research was a classroom action research. The process of this research was conducted in three stages, including, pre cycle, cycle 1, and cycle 2. Cycle 1 was planned after conducting pre cycle. Cycle 2 was conducted based on the reflection results of cycle 1. The data were collected using observation during the teaching learning process in pre cycle, cycle 1, and cycle 2 and test to measure the improvement of students’ understanding in each cycle. The results of the analysis were used to describe the improvement of students’ understanding on adverb of frequency which was indicated by their score in test. It {{can be seen from the}} result of cycle 1, where in pre cycle students’ mean on adverb of frequency was only 55. 75, it increased up to 14. 5 became 70. 25 in cycle 1. In cycle 2 it increased from 70. 25 up to 80. 51 or 10. 26 increased. Based on the results of this research, it could be concluded that by using memory round game in teaching adverb of frequency, teacher could improve students’ understanding on adverb of frequency. And it was hoped that it can be valuable as the information resource for students, teachers, and the writer herself...|$|R

5|$|Sanchez {{grew up in}} a well-disciplined and {{athletic}} family.

A well-regarded prospect, Sanchez committed to Southern California following his successful high school career in which he led his team to a championship title during his senior season.

30|$|Educators can infer {{from this}} study that mental {{mathematics}} may serve as {{an effective way to}} enhance relational thinking at the middle-school level (e.g., the seventh and <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>grades).</b> As our results suggest, students’ abilities in relational thinking improved following a mental mathematics intervention of just 20  min per day over a 15 -day period.

On June 20, 1938, Blackwell's parents separated due to religious differences. Blackwell and her mother went to West Helena, Arkansas, to live with Blackwell's great aunt so {{that she had the}} opportunity to receive an education. A quality education in Mississippi was not an option for Blackwell because the schools there were centered on the cultivation of crops and the plantation system. While living in West Helena, Blackwell often visited her father in Memphis. During the summer months she would leave West Helena and live with her grandfather and grandmother in Lula, where she helped plant and harvest cotton. Blackwell spent a majority of her early years chopping cotton in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee and peeling tomatoes in Florida.
