5|$|Monoclonal antibodies, {{which are}} drugs {{of the same}} family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of {{interest}} and research. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied {{by the appearance of}} potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> <b>what</b> patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.|$|E
5|$|Motor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in {{the early}} stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, {{individuals}} are expected to lose independent ambulation after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years. However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms, while at the same time it is a new source of disability, because of the undesired effects of levodopa after years of use. In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years. However, it is hard <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> <b>what</b> course the disease will take for a given individual. Age is the best predictor of disease progression. The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} written {{as a form}} of literary research into the water retention abilities of landscape in the Czech Republic. A descriptive overview is given of the factors that influence the ability of landscape to retain water and the subsequent application of this knowledge to instigate increased retention levels. Comparisons are made for the individual factors and measures over time, with a view <b>to</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>what</b> may happen in the future. The final chapter looks in-depth at the phenomenom associated with the poor water retention capabilities of landscape as a result of incorrect interventions, in most cases anthropogenic, in the countryside. An evaluation of the broader issues regarding such interventions and the implementation of measures follows in the conclusion...|$|R

25|$|Warfarin {{and other}} 4-hydroxycoumarins block {{the action of}} VKOR. This results in {{decreased}} concentrations of vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in tissues, such that the carboxylation reaction catalyzed by the glutamyl carboxylase is inefficient.

Without Gla on the amino termini of these factors, they no longer bind stably to the blood vessel endothelium and cannot activate clotting to allow formation of a clot during tissue injury. As it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> <b>what</b> dose of warfarin will give the desired degree of clotting suppression, warfarin treatment must be carefully monitored to avoid overdose.|$|E

25|$|With the {{eventual}} outcome {{in terms of}} both votes and seats varying substantially from the bulk of opinion polls released in the final months before the election, the polling industry received criticism for their inability <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> <b>what</b> was a surprisingly clear Conservative victory. Several theories have been put forward to explain the inaccuracy of the pollsters. One theory was that there had simply been a very late swing to the Conservatives, with the polling company Survation claiming that 13% of voters made up their minds in the final days and 17% {{on the day of the}} election. The company also claimed that a poll they carried out a day before the election gave the Conservatives 37% and Labour 31%, though they said they did not release the poll (commissioned by the Daily Mirror) on the concern that it was too much of an outlier with other poll results.|$|E

500|$|The solo {{exposition}} follows its orchestral counterpart, {{and it is}} {{here that}} convention is discarded from the outset: the piano does not enter with the principal theme. Instead, it has an 18-measure solo passage. It is only after this passage that the principal theme appears, carried by the orchestra. The piano then picks up the theme from its seventh measure. Another departure from convention is that the solo exposition does not re-state the secondary theme from the orchestral exposition. Instead, a succession of new secondary thematic material appears. Musicologist Donald Tovey considered this introduction of new material to be [...] "utterly subversive of the doctrine that the function of the opening tutti [...] was <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> <b>what</b> the solo had to say." ...|$|E
