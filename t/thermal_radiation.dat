The gross weight was increased by 30,000pounds (13,605kg) to 450,000pounds. A new fire control system, the MD-9, was introduced on this model.

5|$|From {{the core}} {{out to about}} 0.7 solar radii, <b>thermal</b> <b>radiation</b> is the primary means of energy transfer. The {{temperature}} drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core. This temperature gradient {{is less than the}} value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection. Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions. The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm3 to 0.2 g/cm3) from 0.25 solar radii to the 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.|$|E

5|$|Ultraviolet {{astronomy}} employs ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200Å (10 to 320nm). Light {{at those}} wavelengths are {{absorbed by the}} Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited {{to the study of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>radiation</b> and spectral emission lines from hot blue stars (OB stars) that are very bright in this wave band. This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys. Other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include planetary nebulae, supernova remnants, and active galactic nuclei. However, as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by interstellar dust, an adjustment of ultraviolet measurements is necessary.|$|E
5|$|Even more remarkably, {{there is}} a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics, which is {{analogous}} to the laws of thermodynamics. For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the Penrose process). There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy. This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for black hole area to decrease—as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit <b>thermal</b> <b>radiation.</b> Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in Planck's law. This radiation is known as Hawking radiation (cf. the quantum theory section, below).|$|E

25|$|The nerve fibers {{in the pit}} organ are {{constantly}} firing at a very low rate. Objects that are within a neutral temperature range do not change the rate of firing; the neutral range {{is determined by the}} average <b>thermal</b> <b>radiation</b> of all objects in the receptive field of the organ. The <b>thermal</b> <b>radiation</b> above a given threshold causes an increase in the temperature of the nerve fiber, resulting in stimulation of the nerve and subsequent firing, with increased temperature resulting in increased firing rate. The sensitivity of the nerve fibers is estimated to be >0.001°C.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{difference between the}} black hole radiation as computed by Hawking and <b>thermal</b> <b>radiation</b> emitted from a black body is that the latter is statistical in nature, and only its average satisfies {{what is known as}} Planck's law of black body radiation, while the former fits the data better. Thus <b>thermal</b> <b>radiation</b> contains information about the body that emitted it, while Hawking radiation seems to contain no such information, and depends only on the mass, angular momentum, and charge of the black hole (the no-hair theorem). This leads to the black hole information paradox.|$|E
25|$|When <b>thermal</b> <b>radiation</b> strikes an object, part will be reflected, part transmitted, and {{the rest}} absorbed. The {{fraction}} that is absorbed depends on the nature and color of the material. A thin material may transmit a lot. A light colored object may reflect much of the incident radiation and thus escape damage, like anti-flash white paint. The absorbed <b>thermal</b> <b>radiation</b> raises {{the temperature of the}} surface and results in scorching, charring, and burning of wood, paper, fabrics, etc. If the material is a poor thermal conductor, the heat is confined {{to the surface of the}} material.|$|E

25|$|To {{the extent}} that a hot surface emits <b>thermal</b> <b>radiation</b> but is not an ideal black-body radiator, the color {{temperature}} of the light is not the actual temperature of the surface. An incandescent lamp's light is <b>thermal</b> <b>radiation,</b> and the bulb approximates an ideal black-body radiator, so its color temperature is essentially {{the temperature of the}} filament. Thus a relatively low temperature emits a dull red and a high temperature emits the almost white of the traditional incandescent light bulb.

25|$|Thinking theoretically, Kirchhoff went {{a little}} further, and pointed out that this implied that the {{spectral}} radiance, {{as a function of}} radiative frequency, of any such cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium must be a unique universal function of temperature. He postulated an ideal black body that interfaced with its surrounds in just {{such a way as to}} absorb all the radiation that falls on it. By the Helmholtz reciprocity principle, radiation from the interior of such a body would pass unimpeded, directly to its surrounds without reflection at the interface. In thermodynamic equilibrium, the <b>thermal</b> <b>radiation</b> emitted from such a body would have that unique universal spectral radiance as a function of temperature.
