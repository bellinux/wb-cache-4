25|$|Dr. Satyajit Chavan is {{the head}} doctor at a civil {{hospital}} in Delhi. Satyajit is well regarded and respected, but he has terrible bedside manners and is generally rude to everyone. His staff of doctors, {{most of whom are}} young interns fresh out of medical school, inquire about his bedside manner. He curtly informs them that his job is to treat patients and that beds must be allocated to <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> most likely to survive and get better. We discover that government hospitals (especially in large cities like Mumbai) are severely limited in bed space and attract the worst stricken patients in the city. These draconian conditions have shaped Satyajit and his views on treatment.|$|E

In January 2005, Bettman commented that he was hesitant to allow league participation in the Olympics {{because he did not}} like the idea of stopping play mid-season after the cancellation of the previous season. The lockout was resolved in July 2005 and the newly negotiated NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement allowed league participation in the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics. Some NHL team owners were against their players participating in the tournament because of concerns about injury or exhaustion. Philadelphia Flyers owner Ed Snider commented that [...] "I'm a believer in the Olympics and I think it's good for the NHL to participate, having said that, the people who participate should be <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> absolutely healthy." [...] Some NHL players used the break as an opportunity to rest and did not participate in the tournament, and several players were injured during the Olympics and were forced to miss NHL games. Bettman said that several format changes were being discussed so that the tournament would be [...] "a little easier for everybody".|$|E

500|$|Since 1983, Shearer {{has been}} {{the host of the}} public radio comedy/music program Le Show. The program is a hodgepodge of satirical news commentary, music, and sketch comedy that takes aim at the [...] "mega morons of the mighty media". It is carried on many National Public Radio and other public radio {{stations}} throughout the United States. Since the merger of SIRIUS and XM satellite radio services the program is no longer available on either. The show has also been made available as a podcast on iTunes and by WWNO. On the weekly program Shearer alternates between DJing, reading and commenting on {{the news of the day}} after the manner of Mort Sahl, and performing original (mostly political) comedy sketches and songs. In 2008, Shearer released a music CD called Songs of the Bushmen, consisting of his satirical numbers about former President George W. Bush on Le Show. Shearer says he criticizes both Republicans and Democrats equally, and also says that [...] "the iron law of doing comedy about politics is you make fun of whoever is running the place" [...] and that [...] "everyone else is just running around talking. They are <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> actually doing something, changing people's lives for better or for worse. Other people the media calls 'satirists' don't work that way." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the Coroner's Inquest, {{the leak}} that Tony Harnischfeger had spotted was cited as {{evidence}} that the dam was leaking {{on the day of the}} break, and that both the Bureau of Water Works and Supply and Mulholland were aware of it. Mulholland told the jury he had been at the dam the day of the break, due to the dam keeper's call, but neither he nor Van Norman had observed anything of concern, nor found any dangerous conditions. Mulholland further testified that leaks in dams, especially of the type and size of the St. Francis, were common. During the Inquest Mulholland said, [...] "This inquest is a very painful thing for me to have to attend but it is the occasion of it that is painful.

2500|$|The {{series has}} been noted for its {{relatively}} sympathetic portrayal of the aristocratic family, and the class-based society of early 20thcentury Britain. This has led to criticism from the political left and praise from the right. James Fenton wrote in The New York Review of Books [...] "it is noticeable that the aristocrats in the series, even <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{supposed to be the}} most ridiculous, never lapse into the most offensive kind of upper-class drawl one would expect of them. Great care has been taken to keep them pleasant and approachable, even when the things they say are sometimes shown to be class-bound and unfeeling." [...] Jerry Bowyer argued in Forbes that the sympathy for aristocracy is over-stated, and that the show is simply more balanced than most period dramas, which he believes have had a tendency to demonise or ridicule upper class characters. He wrote that Downton Abbey shows [...] "there is no inherent need for good TV to be left of center. Stories sympathetic to virtue, preservation of property and admiration of nobility and of wealth can be told beautifully and to wide audiences." ...|$|E
