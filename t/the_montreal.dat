5|$|Although Canada was a {{major source}} of uranium ore and heavy water, these were {{controlled}} by the Americans. Anglo-American cooperation broke down, denying <b>the</b> <b>Montreal</b> Laboratory scientists access to the materials they needed to build a reactor. In 1943, the Quebec Agreement merged Tube Alloys with the American Manhattan Project. The Americans agreed to help build the reactor. Scientists who were not British subjects left, and John Cockcroft became the new director of <b>the</b> <b>Montreal</b> Laboratory in May 1944. The Chalk River Laboratories opened in 1944, and <b>the</b> <b>Montreal</b> Laboratory was closed in July 1946. Two reactors were built at Chalk River. The small ZEEP went critical on 5 September 1945, and the larger NRX on 21 July 1947. NRX was for a time the most powerful research reactor in the world.|$|E

5|$|In 1895, Queen's University was {{the first}} {{official}} challenger for the Cup, although it was controversial. <b>The</b> <b>Montreal</b> Victorias had won the league title and thus the Stanley Cup, but the challenge match was between the previous year's champion, Montreal HC, and the university squad. The trustees decided that if <b>the</b> <b>Montreal</b> HC won the challenge match, the Victorias would become the Stanley Cup champions. <b>The</b> <b>Montreal</b> HC won the match 5–1 and their cross-town rivals were crowned the champions. The first successful challenge to the Cup came the next year by the Winnipeg Victorias, the champions of the Manitoba Hockey League.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Montreal</b> team in Canada {{depended}} on the Americans for supplies of heavy water from the US heavy water plant in Trail, British Columbia, (which was under American contract), as well as technical information about plutonium.

Despite doing much good work, by June 1943 work at <b>the</b> <b>Montreal</b> Lab had come to a complete standstill. Morale was low and the Canadian Government proposed cancelling the project. In April 1944, a Combined Policy Committee meeting in Washington agreed that Canada would build a heavy water reactor. John Cockcroft became the director. The Americans supported the project with information and visits. They also supplied material, for example, uranium and heavy water. The Chalk River Laboratories opened in 1944, and in 1946 <b>the</b> <b>Montreal</b> Laboratory was closed. The project developed the ZEEP reactor, which went critical in September 1945.|$|E
