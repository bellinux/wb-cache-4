5|$|Louis XVIII ruled as king for {{slightly}} less than a decade. The Bourbon Restoration regime was a constitutional monarchy (unlike the ancien régime, which was absolutist). As a constitutional monarch, Louis XVIII's royal prerogative was reduced substantially by the Charter of 1814, France's new constitution. Louis had no children; therefore, upon his death, the crown passed <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother,</b> Charles, Count of Artois. Louis XVIII was the last French monarch to die while reigning, as his successor Charles X (1824–1830) abdicated and both Louis Philippe I (1830–1848) and Napoléon III (1852–1870) were deposed.|$|E
