The lines [...] "No more {{going to the}} dark side with your flying saucer eyes / No more falling down a wormhole that I have to pull you out", from the track [...] "Atoms for Peace", were inspired by an [...] "admonition" [...] from Yorke's partner Rachel Owen. According to the Globe and Mail, [...] "The Clock", influenced by Arabic music, is a [...] "gliding, droning song about losing control while pretending 'that you are still in charge'." [...] "Analyse" [...] was inspired by a blackout Yorke experienced in his hometown Oxford: [...] "The houses were all dark, with candlelight in the windows, which is obviously how it would have been when they were built. It was beautiful." [...] The song [...] "Atoms for Peace" [...] references a 1953 speech by American President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

500|$|The casting {{directors}} for Obsessed were Ron Digman and Valorie Massalas. According to Packer, Elba and Larter {{were the}} favorite actors for their respective lead roles; {{he stated that}} [...] "they both brought {{the right amount of}} depth and sex appeal" [...] to the film. He emphasized the need for actors [...] "who were relatable and who can handle that type of human interplay <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film." [...] Packer showed the film script to Beyoncé's talent agent, who suggested that Beyoncé play the role of Sharon. The producers [...] "immediately ... fell in love with that idea; once she suggested Beyoncé, nobody else could play the role." [...] Packer said that Beyoncé became interested in working on Obsessed because the film was not focused on the music industry, and that {{it was the first time}} she played a non-singer. Packer also reported that [...] "she was looking for that challenge and welcomed this opportunity". Beyoncé stated that she found it challenging to concentrate purely on [...] "the emotion and the psychology of the relationship". Beyoncé had never taken part in a fight scene, but she was able to learn how to perform the scenes quickly because they were similar to dance choreography, with which she was familiar. Larter was inspired by Rita Hayworth, Barbara Stanwyck and Faye Dunaway, all of whom had previously portrayed femmes fatale. Obsessed was filmed over the summer of 2008, and the final fight scene between Sharon and Lisa was shot over one week.|$|E
500|$|Framestore {{was chosen}} {{to work on the}} Cloak of Levitation, due to their work {{creating}} Rocket in Guardians of the Galaxy. Ceretti called Cloak's actions [...] "kind of scripted but not as deeply" [...] as the end result, and said that during the pre-visualization process [...] "we had a big discussion about the arc of the story of the Cloak in the film". Framestore also worked on environment shots, the Mandelbrot set sequences, high resolution digital doubles, the astral form, and the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restraint for Kaecilius, totaling over 365 shots. Alexis Wajsbrot, Framestore's CG Supervisor, called the astral form [...] "one of the hardest effects we’ve had to deal with at Framestore; finding the right balance of a look that was subtle but also beautiful." [...] Lola VFX worked on the Zealots' eyes, supplementing the make-up work with effects based on a geode. They also created digital tears for Kaecilius when he is in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. In addition to Dormammu and the Dark Dimension, Luma Pictures also created the first mirror sequence {{at the beginning of the}} film. In creating Dormammu, Ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid the fiery head look from the comics as [...] "it had been done before. The whole idea is he's a character that lives in-between dimensions. He can also take whatever shapes he wants to take. [...] you can feel all these ripples in his face and all that stuff… these kind of opening windows to other dimensions, and all the reflective qualities of it. We really wanted to add the evocation of that fire, but we didn't want to do fire so we went for [...] multicolored approach to try and keep the psychedelic [...] of the entire space." [...] On the Dark Dimension, Ceretti said, [...] "We tried to make it alive all the time—the whole idea of the Dark Dimension is that it's a dynamic environment," [...] with the Luma team referencing the Ditko art and a poster that when lit [...] "with a blacklight it becomes very saturated [...] colors, crazy blacklight colors." [...] He continued, [...] "It was all about finding the right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute the work of Steve Ditko, but to make it more current to the 21st century. If you look at the detail of the shapes <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dark Dimension, you can almost point to things in the comic books [...] we really tried to be faithful to." ...|$|E

6000|$|I pass on {{from that}} now, as I merely wished {{to explain to}} you what I meant {{by the use of}} the term [...] "Geographical Distribution." [...] As I said, there is another aspect, and a much more {{important}} one, and that is, the relations of the various animals to one another. The horse is a very well-defined matter-of-fact sort of animal, and we are all pretty familiar with its structure. I dare say it may have struck you, that it resembles very much no other member of the animal kingdom, except perhaps the zebra or the ass. But let me ask you to look along these diagrams. Here is the skeleton of the horse, and here the skeleton of the dog. You will notice <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> horse a skull, a backbone and ribs, shoulder-blades and haunch-bones. In the fore-limb, one upper arm-bone, two fore arm-bones, wrist-bones (wrongly called knee), and middle hand-bones, ending in the three bones of a finger, the last of which is sheathed in the horny hoof of the fore-foot: in the hind-limb, one thigh-bone, two leg-bones, ankle-bones, and middle foot-bones, ending in the three bones of a toe, the last of which is encased in the hoof of the hind-foot. Now turn to the dog's skeleton. We find identically the same bones, but more of them, there being more toes in each foot, and hence more toe-bones.|$|E
60|$|You {{altered the}} Liturgy for the Directory. This was settled {{by a set}} of most learned divines and learned laymen: Selden sat amongst them. Did this please? It was {{considered}} upon both sides as a most unchristian imposition. Well, at the Restoration they rejected the Directory, and reformed the Common Prayer,--which, by the way, had been three times reformed before. Were they then contented? Two thousand (or some great number) of clergy resigned their livings in one day rather than read it: and truly, rather than raise that second idol, I should have adhered to the Directory, as I now adhere to the Common Prayer. Nor can you content other men's conscience, real or pretended, by any concessions: follow your own; seek peace and ensue it. You have no symptoms of discontent in the people to their Establishment. The churches are too small for their congregations. The livings are too few for their candidates. The spirit of religious controversy has slackened by the nature of things: by act you may revive it. I will not enter into the question, how much truth is preferable to peace. Perhaps truth may be far better. But as we have scarcely ever the same certainty in the one <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other, I would, unless the truth were evident indeed, hold fast to peace, which has in her company charity, the highest of the virtues.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the other}} hand, if Darwin even admits--we {{will not say}} adopts--the theistic view, he may save himself much needless trouble in the {{endeavor}} {{to account for the}} absence of every sort of intermediate form.

For his particular theory is based, and even over-strictly insists, upon the most universal of physiological laws, namely, that successive generations shall differ only slightly, if at all, from their parents; and this effectively excludes crude and impotent forms.

60|$|If further elucidation be needed, we {{may find}} it in every nursery. The infant European has sundry marked points of {{resemblance}} to the lower human races; as in the flatness of the alæ of the nose, the depression of its bridge, the divergence and forward opening of the nostrils, {{the form of the}} lips, the absence of a frontal sinus, the width between the eyes, the smallness of the legs. Now, as the development process by which these traits are turned into those of the adult European, is a continuation of that change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous displayed during the previous evolution of the embryo, which every physiologist will admit; it follows that the parallel developmental process by which the like traits of the barbarous races have been turned into those of the civilised races, has also been a continuation of the change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous. The truth of the second position--that Mankind, as a whole, have become more heterogeneous--is so obvious as scarcely to need illustration. Every work on Ethnology, by its divisions and subdivisions of races, bears testimony to it. Even were we to admit the hypothesis that Mankind originated from several separate stocks, it would still remain true, that as, from each of these stocks, there have sprung many now widely different tribes, which are proved by philological evidence to have had a common origin, the race as a whole is far less homogeneous than it once was. Add to which, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Americans, an example of a new variety arising within these few generations; and that, if we may trust to the description of observers, we are likely soon to have another such example in Australia.|$|E
60|$|Lastly, he {{is bound}} tenderly to {{life by the}} thought of his friends; or shall we not say rather, that by their thought for him, by their {{unchangeable}} solicitude and love, he remains woven into the very stuff of life, beyond the power of bodily dissolution to undo? In a thousand ways will he survive and be perpetuated. Much of Etienne de la Boetie survived during all the years in which Montaigne continued to converse with him on the pages of the ever-delightful essays. Much of what was truly Goethe was dead already when he revisited places that knew him no more, and found no better consolation than the promise of his own verses, that soon he too would be at rest. Indeed, when we think of what it is that we most seek and cherish, and find most pride and pleasure in calling ours, it will sometimes seem to us as if our friends, at our decease, would suffer loss more truly than ourselves. As a monarch who should care more for the outlying colonies he knows on the map or through the report of his vicegerents, than for the trunk of his empire under his eyes at home, are we not more concerned about the shadowy life <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hearts of others, and that portion in their thoughts and fancies which, in a certain far-away sense, belongs to us, than about the real knot of our identity - that central metropolis of self, of which alone we are immediately aware - or the diligent service of arteries and veins and infinitesimal activity of ganglia, which we know (as we know a proposition in Euclid) to be the source and substance of the whole? At the death of every one whom we love, some fair and honourable portion of our existence falls away, and we are dislodged from one of these dear provinces; and they are not, perhaps, the most fortunate who survive a long series of such impoverishments, till their life and influence narrow gradually into the meagre limit of their own spirits, and death, when he comes at last, can destroy them at one blow.|$|E
6000|$|There is {{no part of}} Burke's {{career at}} which we may not find {{evidence}} of his instinctive and undying repugnance to the critical or revolutionary spirit and all its works. From the early days when he had parodied Bolingbroke, down to the later time when he denounced Condorcet as a fanatical atheist, with [...] "every disposition to the lowest {{as well as the}} highest and most determined villainies," [...] he invariably suspected or denounced everybody, virtuous or vicious, high-minded or ignoble, who inquired with too keen a scrutiny into the foundations of morals, of religion, of social order. To examine with a curious or unfavourable eye the bases of established opinions, was to show a leaning to anarchy, to atheism, or to unbridled libertinism. Already we have seen how, three years after the publication of his Thoughts on the Present Discontents, and seventeen years before the composition of the Reflections, he denounced the philosophers with a fervour and a vehemence which he never afterwards surpassed. When a few of the clergy petitioned to be relieved from some of the severities of subscription, he had resisted them on the bold ground that the truth of a proposition deserves less attention than the effect of adherence to it upon the established order of things. [...] "I will not enter into the question," [...] he told the House of Commons, [...] "how much truth is preferable to peace. Perhaps truth may be far better. But as we have scarcely ever the same certainty in the one <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other, I would, unless the truth were evident indeed, hold fast to peace." [...] In that intellectual restlessness, to which the world is so deeply indebted, Burke could recognise but scanty merit. Himself the most industrious and active-minded of men, he was ever sober in cutting the channels of his activity, and he would have had others equally moderate. Perceiving that plain and righteous conduct is the end of life in this world, he prayed men not to be over-curious in searching for, and handling, and again handling, the theoretic base on which the prerogatives of virtue repose. Provided that there was peace, that is to say, so much of fair happiness and content as is compatible with the conditions of the human lot, Burke felt that a too great inquisitiveness as to its foundations was not only idle but cruel.|$|E

6000|$|But {{the large}} toleration these {{considerations}} dictate has limits. For example, though we tolerate, and rightly tolerate, the propaganda of Anarchism {{as a political}} theory which embraces all that is valuable in the doctrine of Laisser-Faire and the method of Free Trade {{as well as all}} that is shocking in the views of Bakounine, we clearly cannot, or at all events will not, tolerate assassination of rulers on the ground that it is [...] "propaganda by deed" [...] or sociological experiment. A play inciting to such an assassination cannot claim the privileges of heresy or immorality, because no case can be made out in support of assassination as an indispensable instrument of progress. Now it happens <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Julius Caesar of Shakespear a play which the Tsar of Russia or the Governor-General of India would hardly care to see performed in their capitals just now. It is an artistic treasure; but it glorifies a murder which Goethe described as the silliest crime ever committed. It may quite possibly have helped the regicides of 1649 to see themselves, as it certainly helped generations of Whig statesmen to see them, in a heroic light; and it unquestionably vindicates and ennobles a conspirator who assassinated the head of the Roman State not because he abused his position but solely because he occupied it, thus affirming the extreme republican principle that all kings, good or bad, should be killed because kingship and freedom cannot live together. Under certain circumstances this vindication and ennoblement might act as an incitement to an actual assassination as well as to Plutarchian republicanism; for {{it is one thing to}} advocate republicanism or royalism: it is quite another to make a hero of Brutus or Ravaillac, or a heroine of Charlotte Corday. Assassination is the extreme form of censorship; and it seems hard to justify an incitement to it on anti-censorial principles. The very people who would have scouted the notion of prohibiting the performances of Julius Caesar at His Majesty's Theatre in London last year, might now entertain very seriously a proposal to exclude Indians from them, and to suppress the play completely in Calcutta and Dublin; for if the assassin of Caesar was a hero, why not the assassins of Lord Frederick Cavendish, Presidents Lincoln and McKinley, and Sir Curzon Wyllie? Here is a strong case for some constitutional means of preventing the performance of a play. True, it is an equally strong case for preventing the circulation of the Bible, which was always in the hands of our regicides; but as the Roman Catholic Church does not hesitate to accept that consequence of the censorial principle, it does not invalidate the argument.|$|E
60|$|Whether {{an advance}} from the {{homogeneous}} to the heterogeneous {{is or is}} not displayed in the biological history of the globe, it is clearly enough displayed in the progress of the latest and most heterogeneous creature--Man. It is true alike that, during the period in which the Earth has been peopled, the human organism has grown more heterogeneous among the civilized divisions of the species; and that the species, as a whole, has been growing more heterogeneous in virtue of the multiplication of races and the differentiation of these races from each other. In proof of the first of these positions, we may cite the fact that, in the relative development of the limbs, the civilized man departs more widely from the general type of the placental mammalia than do the lower human races. While often possessing well-developed body and arms, the Australian has very small legs: thus reminding us of the chimpanzee and the gorilla, which present no great contrasts in size between the hind and fore limbs. But in the European, the greater length and massiveness of the legs have become marked--the fore and hind limbs are more heterogeneous. Again, the greater ratio which the cranial bones bear to the facial bones illustrates the same truth. Among the vertebrata in general, progress is marked by an increasing heterogeneity in the vertebral column, and more especially in the segments constituting the skull: the higher forms being distinguished by the relatively larger size of the bones which cover the brain, and the relatively smaller size of those which form the jaws, &c. Now this characteristic, which is stronger in Man than in any other creature, is stronger in the European than in the savage. Moreover, judging from the greater extent and variety of faculty he exhibits, we may infer that the civilized man has also a more complex or heterogeneous nervous system than the uncivilized man: and, indeed, the fact is in part visible in the increased ratio which his cerebrum bears to the subjacent ganglia, {{as well as in the}} wider departure from symmetry in its convolutions. If further elucidation be needed, we may find it in every nursery. The infant European has sundry marked points of resemblance to the lower human races; as in the flatness of the alæ of the nose, the depression of its bridge, the divergence and forward opening of the nostrils, the form of the lips, the absence of a frontal sinus, the width between the eyes, the smallness of the legs. Now, as the developmental process by which these traits are turned into those of the adult European, is a continuation of that change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous displayed during the previous evolution of the embryo, which every anatomist will admit; it follows that the parallel developmental process by which the like traits of the barbarous races have been turned into those of the civilized races, has also been a continuation of the change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous.
