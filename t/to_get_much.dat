5|$|Regardless, the National Hurricane Center issued {{hurricane}} warnings for Guadeloupe on August 2 and {{the rest}} of the Leeward Islands extending to the Virgin Islands. The uncertainty of the hurricanes forecast track forced residents and tourists in the Lesser Antilles to evacuate. In the British Virgin Islands, 80 American and Canadian tourists evacuated to hotels. In Puerto Rico, residents were advised to secure or stow away loose objects and stock up on emergency supplies. 1.1million residents in the city of San Juan went to supermarkets <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>much</b> needed supplies in anticipation that the storm might hit Puerto Rico. In Humacao, the National Guard evacuated 1,966 people living along a coastal highway. The islands of Martinique and Dominica were placed under a hurricane watch. The warning for Guadeloupe was discontinued at 2200 UTC when the hurricane posed no threat to the island. Simultaneously, the hurricane watches in effect for Martinique and Dominica were also discontinued. As Dean continued westward, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the Turks and Caicos Islands. The watch was soon canceled as Dean made its northward turn towards Bermuda.|$|E

25|$|The {{western part}} of the Sunset borders the cold {{northern}} Californian Pacific Ocean coastline, so it tends <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>much</b> of the fog San Francisco is famous for. The Sunset can be foggy and chilly for some days during summer. The Sunset's finest weather is usually from August through December, when regional air patterns transition from onshore to offshore weather and the area is free of fog.

25|$|Polish army of {{that period}} {{consisted}} - as before - of knights, burghers, and peasants, with obvious division of labor and specialization: cavalry, infantry, and fortified cities defenders. The knight, along with his lance belonged to his own chorągiew (or rota) of land, clan, or mercenary, and the best warriors were called to lead the chorągiews of the army. Szlachta of moderate means, able to arm and support the lance, enlisted to a chorągiew of a particular land, where knights had their estates. Poorer knights enlisted to the chorągiews created and maintained by magnates, or to a few mercenary royal chorągiews created under king's order by a particular, rich and famous commandander. Infantry {{was made up of}} peasants (one of five men of royal villages: four remaining in the village had to equip and arm the fifth). Burghers had to defend their cities, and different guilds were responsible for particular part of the walls' defense. They, as much richer than peasants, were able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>much</b> better armours and weapons: light helmets, mail, or mail-plate armours; in addition they were taught how to fight, for which purpose the shot brotherhoods were created.|$|E
25|$|The sixth {{season begins}} {{a year after}} the {{conclusion}} of the fifth season, with Dean living a somewhat happy life with Lisa and Ben. When an emotionless Sam returns to Dean, he is forced to leave his new life behind and work with his resurrected grandfather Samuel to capture Alpha monsters for Crowley. The brothers are unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>much</b> help from Castiel since his time is occupied by a civil war raging in heaven against the archangel Raphael. Dean does not trust Samuel and his suspicions are confirmed when he finds Samuel working with demons to discover the location of Purgatory. Dean discovers that Sam's soul is still in the Cage, so he implores the Horseman Death to retrieve it. To ensure Sam does not remember his time in the Cage, as it may be too much for him to handle, Death blocks that part of Sam's memory using a mental wall. The season's second half revolves around the so-called Mother of All, which ultimately leads to events which prove that Castiel is behind the circumstances of Sam's return, the hunt for the Alpha monsters, and the search for Purgatory and was working with Crowley the entire time. When the brothers try to stop Castiel, he brings Sam's memory of the Cage back and proceeds with his plan, absorbing all the souls from Purgatory and pronouncing himself God, having ascended beyond a mere angel.|$|E

500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Noel Coppage from Stereo Review {{was critical of}} the singing and songwriting, likening Marquee Moon to a stale version of Bruce Springsteen. Nigel Hunter wrote in Gramophone that Verlaine's lyrics and guitar playing were vague and that listeners would need a [...] "strong commitment {{to this type of}} music <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>much</b> out of it". In Rolling Stone, Ken Tucker said the lyrics generally amounted to non sequiturs, meaningless phrases, and pretentious aphorisms, but were ultimately secondary to the music. Although he found Verlaine's solos potentially formless and boring, Tucker credited him for structuring his songs around chilling riffs and [...] "a new commercial impulse that gives his music its catchy, if slashing, hook". High Fidelity felt the music's [...] "scaring amalgam of rich, brightly colored textures" [...] compensated for Verlaine's nearly unintelligible lyrics.|$|E

One of the three pieces, 'Raga – Manj Khamaj,' totals almost an hour, enabling you <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>much</b> closer than on most Shankar albums of the period, to the natural extension and patient exploration of an Indian classical-music evening." [...] In his book The Ambient Century, Mark Prendergast describes the double album as a [...] "classic" [...] and [...] "one {{of the best examples}} of sitar, sarod, tabla and tambura interplay ever recorded".|$|E
2500|$|To achieve such {{consistent}} relative differences {{the absolute}} gear ratios {{should be in}} logarithmic progression; most off-the-shelf cogsets do this with small absolute differences between the smaller sprockets and increasingly larger absolute differences as the sprockets get larger. [...] Because sprockets must have a (relatively small) whole number of teeth {{it is impossible to}} achieve a perfect progression; for example the seven derailleur sprockets 14-16-18-21-24-28-32 have an average step size of around 15% but with actual steps varying between 12.5% and 16.7%. The epicyclic gears used within hub gears have more scope for varying the number of teeth than do derailleur sprockets, so it may be possible <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>much</b> closer to the ideal of consistent relative differences, e.g. the Rohloff Speedhub offers 14 speeds with an average relative difference of 13.6% and individual variations of around 0.1%.|$|E

2500|$|Pollard has {{attempted}} to examine the negative views of Crabbe {{and the reasons for}} limited readership since his lifetime: [...] "Why did Crabbe's 'realism' and his discovery of what in effect was the short story in verse fail to appeal to the fiction-dominated Victorian age? Or is it that somehow psychological analysis and poetry are uneasy bedfellows? But then why did Browning succeed and Crabbe descend to the doldrums or to the coteries of admiring enthusiasts? And why have we in this century (the 20th century) failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>much</b> nearer to him? Does this mean that each succeeding generation must struggle to find his characteristic and essential worth? FitzGerald was only one of many among those who would make 'cullings from' or 'readings in' Crabbe. The implications of such selection are clearly that, though much has vanished, much deserves to remain." ...|$|E

The Diamondbacks wound up with a series split thanks to Jake Lamb's tie-breaking homer in the 8th leading them to a 4–2 win. In the next game Nolan Arenado hit two homers off of a struggling Ryu and the Rockies beat the Dodgers 4–3. After a rough first inning, Kershaw struck out 10 in seven innings to help end the losing streak with a 4–2 win over the Rockies.|$|E

2500|$|Discrimination {{against the}} Alaskan Territory made it {{difficult}} for Congress <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>much</b> done. Discussion of revising the Second Organic Act took up much time but came to no avail. Instead Congress passed the Jones Act (also known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920) and the White Act of 1924 both of which made the fishing problem worse for Alaskans rather than better. Alaskans were angered by these two acts and felt they were discriminatory. Matters were made worse by regional conflicts which drew attention away from the issue of statehood. In the 1930s Alaska was plagued by the Depression. During this time, President Roosevelt did two significant things for Alaska. First he allowed for 1,000 selected farmers hurt by the depression to move to Alaska and colonize the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, being given a second chance at agricultural success. Second and more importantly, Roosevelt appointed Ernest Gruening as governor of Alaska in 1939. Edward Lewis [...] "Bob" [...] Bartlett, who was one of Alaska's territorial delegates to Congress from 1944 to 1958 when he became a US senator representing Alaska, would become one of Gruening's most important allies in supporting the cause for Alaskan statehood.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, {{a disgruntled}} {{employee}} at the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station in Canada obtained a sample (estimated as about a [...] "half cup") of heavy {{water from the}} primary heat transport loop of the nuclear reactor, and loaded it into a cafeteria drink dispenser. Eight employees drank some of the contaminated water. The incident was discovered when employees began leaving bioassay urine samples with elevated tritium levels. The quantity of heavy water involved was far below levels that could induce heavy water toxicity, but several employees received elevated radiation doses from tritium and neutron-activated chemicals in the water. This was not an incident of heavy water poisoning, but rather radiation poisoning from other isotopes in the heavy water. Some news services were not careful to distinguish these points, {{and some of the}} public were left with the impression that heavy water is normally radioactive and more severely toxic than it is. Even if pure heavy water had been used in the water cooler indefinitely, it is not likely the incident would have been detected or caused harm, since no employee would be expected <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>much</b> more than 25% of their daily drinking water from such a source.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{the film}} and the play take {{dramatic}} license with the on-air and behind-the-scene details of The Nixon Interviews. [...] Jonathan Aitken, one of Nixon's official biographers who spent much time with the former president at La Casa Pacifica, rebukes the film for its portrayal of a drunken Nixon making a late-night phone call as never having happened and says it is [...] "from start to finish, an artistic invention by the scriptwriter Peter Morgan." [...] Director Ron Howard discussed the scene in detail on his feature commentary for the DVD release, pointing out it was a deliberate act of dramatic license, and while Frost never received such a phone call, [...] "it was known that Richard Nixon, during ...the Watergate scandal, had occasionally made midnight phone calls that he couldn't very well recall the following day." [...] Aitken recalls that [...] "Frost did not ambush Nixon during the final interview into a damaging admission of guilt. What the former president 'confessed' about Watergate was carefully pre-planned. It was only with considerable help and advice from his adversary's team that Frost managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>much</b> more out of Nixon, in the closing sequences, by reining in his fierce attitude and adopting a gentler approach." [...] Elizabeth Drew of the Huffington Post and author of Richard M. Nixon (2007) noted some inaccuracies, including a misrepresentation {{of the end of}} the interviews, the failure to mention the fact that Nixon received 20% of the profits from the interviews, and what she says are inaccurate representations of some of the characters. Drew points out a critical line in the movie that is particularly deceptive: Nixon admitted he [...] "'...was involved in a 'cover-up,' as you call it.' The ellipsis is of course unknown to the audience, and is crucial: What Nixon actually said was, 'You're wanting me to say that I participated in an illegal cover-up. No!'" ...|$|E
