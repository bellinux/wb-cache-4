5|$|Since 1963, {{the custom}} in most {{years has been}} to start the tournament with an honorary opening <b>tee</b> <b>shot</b> at the first hole, {{typically}} {{by one or more}} legendary players. The original honorary starters were Jock Hutchison and Fred McLeod; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening <b>tee</b> <b>shot</b> in 2002, a little over a month before he died.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Arnold Palmer {{took over}} as the honorary starter. Palmer also had the honor in 2008 and 2009. At the 2010 and 2011 Masters Tournaments, Jack Nicklaus joined Palmer as an honorary co-starter for the event. In 2012, Gary Player joined them. Palmer {{announced}} in March 2016 that a lingering shoulder issue would prevent him from partaking in the 2016 <b>tee</b> <b>shot.</b> Palmer was still in attendance for the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The tournament has {{a number}} of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, {{although}} it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary <b>tee</b> <b>shot</b> {{on the morning of the}} first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.|$|E
50|$|On {{the next}} hole, Mark and Nina both hit poor <b>tee</b> <b>shots</b> {{and would make}} bogey, but their {{teammates}} Mallory and Julien respectively both hit good <b>tee</b> <b>shots</b> and made par to halve the hole.|$|R
50|$|The {{green is}} heavily tiered. Involves high {{punishment}} for errant <b>tee</b> <b>shots</b> and high reward for accuracy.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tee</b> <b>shots</b> on the 8th and 9th {{holes are}} played over public roads Cross Lane and Limbrick Road respectively.|$|R
25|$|During {{the third}} round of the 2006 Ford Championship at Doral, Mickelson gave a spectator $200 after his wayward <b>tee</b> <b>shot</b> at the par-5 10th broke the man's watch.|$|E
25|$|A tee {{is allowed}} {{only for the}} first stroke on each hole, unless the player must hit a {{provisional}} <b>tee</b> <b>shot</b> or replay his or her first shot from the tee.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Montgomerie {{came through}} Open Qualifying at Gailes Links {{to qualify for}} his home Open at Royal Troon. He had the honour of hitting the opening <b>tee</b> <b>shot</b> at the tournament and ended up making the cut.|$|E

5000|$|A {{variant of}} greensome, often {{referred}} to as a gruesome, is sometimes played where the opposing team chooses which of their opponent's <b>tee</b> <b>shots</b> the opponents should use. The player who did not shoot the chosen first shot plays the second shot. Play then continues as a greensome.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} types of bunkers used in golf course {{architecture}} and all {{are designed to be}} impediments to the golfer's progress toward the green. Fairway bunkers are designed primarily to gather up wayward <b>tee</b> <b>shots</b> on par 4 and par 5 holes; they are located to the sides of the fairway or even {{in the middle of the}} fairway. Greenside bunkers are designed to collect wayward approach shots on long holes and <b>tee</b> <b>shots</b> on par 3 holes; they are located near and around the green. Waste bunkers are natural sandy areas, usually very large and often found on links courses; they are not considered hazards according to the rules of golf, and so, unlike in fairway or greenside bunkers, golfers are permitted to ground a club lightly in, or remove loose impediments from, the area around the ball.|$|R
25|$|One {{week after}} his {{marriage}} to Selena in 1998, Nobilo was struck above the left eye by an errant <b>tee</b> <b>shot</b> at the Lake Nona Golf & Country Club in Central Florida. The injury required 30 stitches, and affected his play afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Nicklaus turned 65 in January that year, {{which was}} the last year he could enter The Open Championship as an exempt player. He played with Luke Donald and Tom Watson in his final round. After hitting his <b>tee</b> <b>shot</b> off the 18th tee in the second round, Nicklaus {{received}} a ten-minute standing ovation from the crowd. On the eighteenth fairway, he gave his final farewell to professional golf while standing on the iconic Swilken Bridge. Soon afterwards, Nicklaus ended his career with a birdie, holing a 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th green. Nicklaus missed the 36-hole cut with a score of +3 (147).|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Mickelson won the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial with a −14, {{one shot}} ahead of Tim Clark and Rod Pampling. Mickelson shot a first-round 65 {{to start off}} the tournament at −5. He ended the day tied with Brett Wetterich, two shots behind leader, Johnson Wagner. Mickelson shot a second round 68, and the third round 65, overall, being −12 {{for the first three}} rounds. On the final hole, after an {{absolutely}} horrendous <b>tee</b> <b>shot,</b> he was in thick rough with trees in his way. Many players would have punched out, and taken their chances at making par from the fairway with a good wedge shot. Instead, he pulled out a high-lofted wedge and hit his approach shot over a tree, landing on the green where he one-putted for the win.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1963, Hutchison {{was one of}} the two men {{who served}} as honorary {{starters}} for The Masters (along with 1908 U.S. Open champion Fred McLeod), until ailments prevented him from hitting one of the honorary <b>tee</b> <b>shots</b> in 1973. His death on September 27, 1977 came just two days before Masters co-founder Clifford Roberts' own death.|$|R
50|$|Beginning {{with the}} seventh, the Old Course turns further inland, while {{simultaneously}} changing direction, {{on each of}} its next six holes, among hillier dunes and thicker vegetation, including gorse and whins, to severely punish offline shots. This sector, with two blind <b>tee</b> <b>shots</b> on the tenth and 11th, marks a sharp rise in difficulty from the opening holes.|$|R
5000|$|Smith {{was known}} for his long <b>tee</b> <b>shots</b> and {{accurate}} iron game. His greatest golf achievement came in 1955 during the Texas Open, when he hit seven birdies in a row—a record for a PGA event—at Brackenridge Park Golf Course in San Antonio. The record stood until 1961 when Bob Goalby scored eight birdies in a row during the St. Petersburg Open.|$|R
25|$|In July 1993, Faldo won the Carroll's Irish Open for an {{unprecedented}} {{third time in}} a row. Starting his final round four shots behind José María Olazábal, Faldo's fourth round of 65 enabled him to tie over 72 holes with Olazábal. Faldo won the sudden death playoff at the first extra hole. Later that month, as defending Open champion, Faldo {{was involved in a}} memorable duel with rival Greg Norman in the Open Championship at Royal St George's Golf Club. Starting his final round one shot ahead of Norman, Faldo hit a <b>tee</b> <b>shot</b> on the par-3 11th which appeared to be heading for a hole in one, but the ball hit the cup and rolled away. Faldo played some excellent golf in his final round of 67, but he finished runner-up, two strokes behind Norman, who shot a spectacular final round of 64.|$|E
2500|$|Willow Pond—Off Grinstead Drive, next to {{golf course}} (sometimes {{referred}} to incorrectly by locals as [...] "Cherokee Lake").

Stocked with bass, bluegill, carp, catfish and is seasonally stocked with trout by the state fish & wildlife agency.|$|E
2500|$|Champagne scramble: a {{combination}} of a scramble and best-ball, only the first shot of each hole is a scramble; all players tee off, decide on the best <b>tee</b> <b>shot,</b> then each player plays their own ball starting at that point until they hole out, without deciding any further [...] "best shots". The best score amongst the team's players is counted.|$|E
5000|$|The {{third round}} had an hour-long weather delay and another {{thunderstorm}} hit shortly after 6 pm EST, which halted {{play for the}} day. Nineteen players did not complete the round on Saturday; the final pairing of Mark Lye and Tom Kite had just hit their <b>tee</b> <b>shots</b> at the par-3 12th hole. Play was resumed at 8 am on Sunday morning.Source: ...|$|R
50|$|In the playoff, the {{two were}} tied at three-under after 16 holes, {{following}} January's birdie. Both had pars at the 17th, which effectively turned the 18th hole into sudden-death. Both <b>tee</b> <b>shots</b> found fairway bunkers, and Barber hit a 3-iron onto the green, 18 ft from the cup. January found another bunker short of the green and could not save par from 15 ft.|$|R
50|$|The size of Mount Hood {{golf course}} was {{increased}} from nine to eighteen holes and today it offers challenge and variety {{unique in the}} Boston area. In {{the midst of a}} wooded 300 acre park, 10 mi from the Zakim Bridge it boasts views of nearby Boston, Revere Beach and the wilderness. Notable of the course is that eight of the eighteen tees are elevated allowing high <b>tee</b> <b>shots</b> as well as views from Boston to New Hampshire.|$|R
2500|$|..... a <b>tee</b> <b>shot</b> that {{requires}} a 200-yard carry to clear Kingman Lake on the 538-yard par-5 10th hole. There is a tough, 440-yard slight dogleg par 4 at No. 12, and the No. 1 handicap hole on the course is No. 3, a 520-yard par 5 {{that requires}} one shot over a creek and an approach to a small, elevated green.|$|E
2500|$|A hole is {{classified}} by its par, meaning {{the number of}} strokes a skilled golfer should require to complete play of the hole. The minimum par of any hole is 3 because par always includes a stroke for the <b>tee</b> <b>shot</b> and two putts. [...] Pars of 4 and 5 strokes are ubiquitous on golf courses; more rarely, a few courses feature par-6 and even par-7 holes. Strokes other than the <b>tee</b> <b>shot</b> and putts {{are expected to be}} made from the fairway; for example, a skilled golfer expects to reach the green on a par-4 hole in two strokes—one from the tee (the [...] "drive") and another, second, stroke to the green (the [...] "approach")—and then roll the ball into the hole in two putts for par. Putting the ball on the green with two strokes remaining for putts is called making [...] "green in regulation" [...] or GIR. Missing a GIR does not necessarily mean a golfer will not make par, but it does make doing so more difficult as it reduces the number of putts available; conversely, making a GIR does not guarantee a par, as the player might require three or more putts to [...] "hole out". Professional golfers typically make between 60% and 70% of greens in regulation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} {{to the lack of}} information and prolonged absence, Brittany Lincicome questioned whether Wie and her parents had fabricated the injury in order to give her a reason to take a break from golf. At the Ginn Tribute Hosted by Annika in May 2007, Wie's playing partner, Alena Sharp, questioned Wie's withdrawal from the tournament due to wrist injury. However, Wie's other playing partner, Janice Moodie, stated that she heard Wie say [...] "Ouch!" [...] after hitting her <b>tee</b> <b>shot,</b> and confirmed [...] "She didn't swing as hard from that point on." ...|$|E
5000|$|At {{the second}} playoff hole, the par-3 17th [...] "Island Green," [...] an unruly spectator {{jumped into the}} water as Sluman was {{addressing}} his 6 ft birdie putt for the win. After order was restored, he missed {{and they went to}} third extra hole at 18. Both found the fairway with their <b>tee</b> <b>shots</b> but both approaches went deep. Sluman couldn't save par from 12 ft while Lyle made his from 7 ft to end it.|$|R
50|$|Variations on {{this basic}} set abound; several club options usually exist for almost any shot {{depending}} on the player's skill level and playing style, and the only club universally considered to be indispensable is the putter. Some consider the modern deep-faced driver to be equally irreplaceable; this is cause for some debate, as professional players including Tiger Woods have played and won tournaments without using a driver, instead using a 3-wood for <b>tee</b> <b>shots</b> and making up the difference on the approach using a lower-lofted iron.|$|R
25|$|Greensome (also {{known as}} Scotch Foursomes): also called {{modified}} alternate shot, this is played in pairs; both players tee off, and then pick {{the best shot}} as in a scramble. The player who did not shoot the best first shot plays the second shot. The play then alternates as in a foursome. A variant of greensome is sometimes played where the opposing team chooses which of their opponent's <b>tee</b> <b>shots</b> the opponents should use. The player who did not shoot the chosen first shot plays the second shot. Play then continues as a greensome.|$|R
2500|$|For {{seventeen}} years, Hobens—who {{was sometimes}} called [...] "Pop"—served {{as the head}} professional at Englewood Country Club. [...] He {{would go on to}} enter many U.S. Open tournaments during his playing career, often finishing in the top ten. He was described as a long hitter of the ball and generally deadly on the green. He had a wonderful opportunity to win the 1907 U.S. Open at Philadelphia Cricket Club. He was the third round leader but finished poorly with a 12-over-par 85 in the final round. In {{the second round of the}} tournament he made the first ever U.S. Open hole-in-one by holing his <b>tee</b> <b>shot</b> at the 147-yard 10th hole.|$|E
2500|$|Accuracy and {{consistency}} are typically stressed over pure distance. A player {{with a straight}} drive that travels only [...] will nevertheless be able to accurately place the ball into a favourable lie on the fairway, and can {{make up for the}} lesser distance of any given club by simply using [...] "more club" [...] (a lower loft) on their <b>tee</b> <b>shot</b> or on subsequent fairway and approach shots. However, a golfer with a drive that may go [...] but often doesn't fly straight will be less able to position their ball advantageously; the ball may [...] "hook", [...] "pull", [...] "draw", [...] "fade", [...] "push" [...] or [...] "slice" [...] off the intended line and land out of bounds or in the rough or hazards, and thus the player will require many more strokes to hole out.|$|E
2500|$|Hobens was victimized {{with some}} horribly bad {{luck in the}} 1904 North and South Open at Pinehurst, North Carolina. After 36 holes of {{regulation}} play he was tied for first place with Alec Ross. The two players went to a playoff where Hobens was one shot ahead {{with just a few}} holes to play. He hooked his <b>tee</b> <b>shot</b> into the left rough on a hole but had an easy, unobstructed shot to the green. [...] Upon making his backswing, his clubhead hooked a weed, or a [...] "creeper" [...] as it was called by Jerome Travers, which caused his ball to move. [...] Hobens, unable to stop his stroke, proceeded to miss the ball completely. [...] The unfortunate result was a one-stroke penalty for causing the ball to move and another stroke for the whiff. He ended up losing the tournament.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Palmer's impressive list of awards, he was bestowed {{the honor of}} kicking off the Masters Tournament beginning in 2007. From 2007 to 2009, Palmer was the sole honorary starter. In 2010, longtime friend and competitor Jack Nicklaus was appointed by Augusta National to join Palmer. In 2012, golf's The Big Three reunited as South African golfer Gary Player joined for the ceremonial <b>tee</b> <b>shots</b> as honorary starters for the 76th playing of the Masters Tournament. In describing the effect that Palmer had on the sport, biographer James Dodson stated: ...|$|R
50|$|Several holes have a {{very small}} margin of error between greens and water hazards (4, 8, 14, 17, 18). <b>Tee</b> <b>shots</b> and lay-ups must {{be placed in the}} {{strategic}} part of fairway {{in order to have a}} direct shot into the green. Sometimes golfers get blocked out by overhanging trees, even if they are in the fairway. Holes in which players may be blocked out from the fairway include numbers 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16. Compared to other courses Harbour Town has high percentage of holes with this challenge.|$|R
