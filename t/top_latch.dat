5|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} is 231mm (9.09in) {{in length}} and 130mm (5.12in) tall, weighing 880 g (1lb 15oz) unloaded. It has an octagonal barrel, with the foresight blade being embedded directly into the barrel. The rear sight is incorporated {{into the top of}} the frame. A hinged sideplate allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing. The weapon was opened by lifting the <b>top</b> <b>latch,</b> after which the barrel was swung downward, activating the automatic ejector. The notch that allows access to the cylinder is at the top rear of the frame. The revolver is double-action only because of the absence of a cocking spur, intended to avoid snagging on clothing and firing accidentally. The lock was self-cocking and was slow to respond. The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible. The cylinder contains a serious design flaw, with it only notching while the hammer is cocked. This allows the cylinder to revolve by being brushed against an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion. As the cylinder can move freely, an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot, a dangerous event for the user during combat. Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier knurled pattern as well as differences in external finish, depth, and look of die stamped markings. The bluing of the steel is excellent, even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon. Both the Type 26 Revolver and the ammunition used was later replaced by semi-automatic pistols such as the Nambu {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
50|$|The sample {{here has}} 6 {{conductors}} (of a possible 10), 2 {{on one side}} (visible in picture) and 4 on the opposite side.Connector dimensions are 3mm x 18mm (includes <b>top</b> <b>latch).</b>|$|E
50|$|The MP412 {{was unique}} in {{that it had a}} break-open frame rather than a swing-out {{cylinder}} design of most modern revolvers and a composite bottom frame consisting of steel with a polymer envelope. The REX never entered full production, possibly due to lack of market interest. This {{may be due to the}} break-action design being seen as not as strong as the more modern swing-out cylinder design which is inherently stronger, having a solid top instead of a <b>top</b> <b>latch.</b> The largest potential market, the United States, was closed to this revolver because it was manufactured in Russia; President Bill Clinton signed an agreement with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s voluntarily banning the import of firearms from Russia to the United States.|$|E

50|$|The Engineered Solutions {{segment is}} a leading global {{designer}} and assembler of customized position and motion control systems and other industrial products to various transportation and other niche markets. The vehicle systems product lines (Power-Packer, Gits and Power Gear brands) are sold to the truck, automotive, off-highway and specialty vehicle markets. Products include hydraulic cab-tilt and latching systems sold to global heavy duty truck OEMs such as Volvo, Iveco, Scania AB and CNHTC and electro-hydraulic convertible <b>top</b> <b>latching</b> and actuation systems. The automotive systems are utilized on both retractable soft and hard top vehicles manufactured by OEMs such as Daimler, Audi, Volkswagen, Renault, BMW, Volvo, and Nissan. Diesel engine air flow solutions, such as exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems, are used by diesel engine and turbocharger manufacturers to reduce emissions, improve fuel efficiency and increase horsepower. Primary end markets include heavy duty truck and off-highway equipment serving customers such as Caterpillar Inc., DAF, Honeywell, and BorgWarner. Actuation systems are also sold to various specialty vehicle OEMs (principally in the defense and off-highway markets) such as Oshkosh, BAE Systems, and Winnebago. The Weasler business within the segment provides highly engineered drive train components and systems for agricultural, lawn & turf and industrial markets to customers such as CNH, Deere, MacDon, and Kuhn. Other businesses in this segment include maximatecc, which produces severe-duty electronic instrumentation (including displays and clusters, machine controls and sensors), Elliott which provides custom designed flexible shafts and push pull cable assemblies and Sanlo which produces custom steel cable assemblies.|$|R

50|$|Grant {{continued}} {{working on}} the problem, and in June 1909 {{he came up with}} the plan of installing seals {{in the middle of the}} locks that would prevent downhill leakage. These would sit on the bottom of the lock and be raised using winches, held in place by an inflated india rubber bag at the <b>top,</b> and <b>latches</b> at the sides. Butler responded saying they could not be added unless savings were found elsewhere. These were found by reducing the length of the entrance piers. Butler approved these changes, but it was eventually found that the continual changes in the plans resulted in additional payments to the contractors, who were continually being forced to change plans.|$|R
60|$|Teddy {{resolved}} to cure this. He stuck bits of {{wood in the}} opening {{between it and the}} floor, besides jamming several nails in at the sides and <b>top.</b> Still, the <b>latch</b> would rattle, being complicated in construction, and not easily checked in all its parts. But Teddy was an ingenious fellow. He settled the latch by stuffing it and covering it with a mass of dough! In order further to secure things, he placed a small table against the door, and then sat down on a bench to smoke his pipe beside the door.|$|R
50|$|With {{the efforts}} of {{determined}} astronauts in Endeavours payload bay and persistent engineers on the ground, all four bolts finally latched and locked after the two spacewalkers worked simultaneously {{at the top and}} bottom of the doors. Musgrave anchored himself at the bottom of the doors with a payload retention device which enabled him to use some body force against the doors. Hoffman, who was attached to the robot arm, worked at the top of the doors. The duo successfully latched the doors when they simultaneously <b>latched</b> the <b>top</b> and bottom <b>latches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Oscar Frederick Mossberg (1866-1937) {{was born}} on 1 September 1866 in Sweden, {{near the village of}} Svanskog in VÃ¤rmland, and emigrated to the United States in 1886. Mossberg went to work at the Iver Johnson Arms & Cycle Works in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. While at Iver Johnson, Mossberg {{supervised}} the manufacture of revolvers and shotguns, while contributing some of his own patented designs, including a <b>top</b> strap <b>latching</b> mechanism for the Iver Johnson Safety Revolver. [...] When Mossberg left Iver Johnson, he went on to manage the small factory of the C.S. Shattuck Arms Co. in nearby Hatfield, Massachusetts, which manufactured single and double-barrel breechloading shotguns. From there he went to work for J. Stevens Arms & Tool Co., where he designed a small 4-shot novelty pistol which he patented in his name. [...] Working out of an old barn behind his house, Mossberg and his sons made about 500 of these 4-shot pistols between 1907 and 1909. [...] In 1914, Mossberg left Stevens, moving to New Haven, Connecticut in order to work for Marlin-Rockwell. In 1919, when Marlin-Rockwell went out of business (they primarily made machineguns, and World War I had just ended), the unemployed 53-year-old O.F. Mossberg and his two sons Iver and Harold started a new firearms company of their own, O.F. Mossberg & Sons. [...] Renting a small loft on State Street in New Haven, the Mossbergs began work on a simple four-shot [...]22-caliber pocket pistol, the Brownie. [...] Marketed largely to hunters and trappers for the humane dispatch of wounded or trapped animals, approximately 37,000 Brownie pistols were produced from 1920 to 1932.|$|R
