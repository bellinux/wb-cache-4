5|$|Christian baptismal {{theology}} {{prior to}} the Reformation taught that sacraments, including baptism, are means or instruments through which God communicates grace to people. <b>The</b> <b>sacrament</b> was considered valid regardless of who administered it. Not everyone who received a sacrament, however, received the grace signified by <b>the</b> <b>sacrament.</b> Some medieval theologians spoke of an obstacle of mortal sin which blocks the grace of <b>the</b> <b>sacrament,</b> while others insisted that the recipient be positively open and responding in faith to <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> {{in order to receive}} any benefit. Baptism was believed to be used by the Holy Spirit to transform the believer, and offered the benefits of remission of sins, regeneration, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. <b>The</b> <b>sacrament</b> of penance was believed to be necessary for forgiveness for sins committed after baptism.|$|E
5|$|According {{to church}} doctrine, the sacraments {{of the church}} require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly {{celebrate}}d. In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments. Notably, because the Church teaches that Christ {{is present in the}} Eucharist, those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> until they have received absolution through <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> of Reconciliation (Penance). Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating {{for at least an hour}} before receiving <b>the</b> <b>sacrament.</b> Non-Catholics such are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church sees <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> of {{confirmation}} {{as required}} to complete the grace given in baptism. When adults are baptised, confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards, a practice followed even with newly baptised infants in the Eastern Catholic Churches. In the West confirmation of children is delayed until they {{are old enough to}} understand or at the bishop's discretion. In Western Christianity, particularly Catholicism, <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> is called confirmation, because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism; in the Eastern Churches, it is called chrismation, because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with chrism, a mixture of olive oil and some perfumed substance, usually balsam, blessed by a bishop. Those who receive confirmation must be in a state of grace, which for those who have reached the age of reason means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> of Penance; they should also have the intention of receiving <b>the</b> <b>sacrament,</b> and be prepared to show in their lives that they are Christians.|$|E
40|$|Contemporary personalistic and communicational sacrametology {{shows that}} not only <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> of Holy Orders and Matrimony are {{at the service of}} communion (Catechism of the Catholic Church), but all <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> are at this service and all of them are really <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> of communion. This new vision helps to see their true nature more clearly and fully, brings more {{systematics}} to the theological reflection about <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> and it could be very useful for shaping a Christian’s faith and life...|$|R
5000|$|Luther {{maintained}} that salvation was by faith alone (sola fide) {{without reference to}} good works, alms, penance, or <b>the</b> Church's <b>sacraments.</b> Luther {{maintained that}} <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> were a [...] "means of grace," [...] meaning that while grace was imparted through <b>the</b> <b>Sacraments,</b> <b>the</b> credit for the action belonged to God {{and not to the}} individual.|$|R
50|$|In {{a single}} statement, {{the effect of}} <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> is to infuse {{justifying}} grace into men. That which Christ effects is achieved through <b>the</b> <b>sacraments.</b> Christ's humanity was the instrument for the operation of his divinity; <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> are <b>the</b> instruments through which this operation of Christ's humanity passes over to men. Christ's humanity served his divinity as instrumentum conjunctum, like <b>the</b> hand; <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> are instrumenta separata, like a staff; the former can use the latter, as the hand can use a staff. For a more detailed exposition, cf. Seeberg, ut sup., ii. 112 sqq.|$|R
5|$|The Eucharistic celebration, {{also called}} the Mass or Divine liturgy, {{includes}} prayers and scriptural readings, {{as well as an}} offering of bread and wine, which are brought to the altar and consecrated by the priest to become the body and the blood of Jesus Christ, a change called transubstantiation. The words of consecration reflect the words spoken by Jesus during the Last Supper, where Christ offered his body and blood to his Apostles the night before his crucifixion. <b>The</b> <b>sacrament</b> re-presents (makes present) the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, and perpetuates it. Christ's death and resurrection gives grace through <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> that unites the faithful with Christ and one another, remits venial sin, and aids against committing moral sin (though mortal sin itself is forgiven through <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> of penance).|$|E

5|$|In Reformed theology, the Lord's Supper or Eucharist is {{a sacrament}} that spiritually nourishes Christians and {{strengthens}} their union with Christ. The outward or physical action of <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> is eating bread and drinking wine. Reformed confessions, which are official {{statements of the}} beliefs of Reformed churches, teach that Christ's body and blood are really present in <b>the</b> <b>sacrament,</b> but that this presence is communicated in a spiritual manner rather than by his body being physically eaten. The Reformed doctrine of real presence is sometimes called mystical real presence or spiritual real presence.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Neville Clark has rightly {{warned against}} {{the attempt to}} {{approach}} the theology of <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> from a broad and general definition of a 'sacrament' from which we 'read off' a Christian doctrine of <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> without paying due regard to the biblical statements. Such an approach could not but obscure the essential differences between <b>the</b> <b>sacraments,</b> and <b>the</b> fact that they stem from historical roots. On the other hand, the specialist treatment of <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> which begins by making {{a detailed analysis of}} the biblical material fails to do justice to the wholeness of biblical theology and tends to treat <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> in isolation not only from each other but also from other aspects of Christian theology with which they are inalienably connected. Bearing in mind the difficulties inherent in both of these approaches, a fresh and more systematic approach is required...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} follow the way {{prescribed}} by this perfect man, {{in order to live}} with God's grace (which is necessary for man's salvation), <b>the</b> <b>Sacraments</b> have been provided; the final part of the Summa considers <b>the</b> <b>Sacraments.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> follows <b>the</b> Christology; <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> [...] "have efficacy from the incarnate Word himself". They {{are not only}} signs of sanctification, but also bring it about. It is inevitable that they bring spiritual gifts in sensuous form, because of the sensuous nature of man. The res sensibiles are the matter, the words of institution the form of <b>the</b> <b>sacraments.</b> Contrary to <b>the</b> Franciscan view that <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> are mere symbols whose efficacy God accompanies with a directly following creative act in the soul, St. Thomas holds it not unfit to agree with Hugo of St. Victor that [...] "a sacrament contains grace", or to teach that they [...] "cause grace".|$|R
5|$|The Reformed {{confessions of}} faith, {{official}} {{statements of the}} beliefs of Reformed churches, followed the view that Christ is really present in the Supper. They either took Calvin's view that the signs of bread and wine are instrumental in communicating grace, or Bullinger's symbolic parallelism. Some of the German-language Reformed confessions seem hesitant to make <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> a means of grace, but they all maintain {{that there is a}} union between the outward signs of <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> and the inward grace signified. Reformed orthodox theologians also continued to insist on Christ's real presence in the Supper, while denying against Lutherans that his body is locally present.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sacrament</b> is also {{referred}} to as Unction, and in the past as Extreme Unction, and {{it is one of the}} three sacraments that constitute the last rites, together with Penance and Viaticum (Eucharist).|$|E
5|$|All clergy, whether deacons, priests or bishops, may preach, teach, baptise, witness {{marriages and}} conduct funeral liturgies. Only bishops and priests can {{administer}} the sacraments of the Eucharist, Reconciliation (Penance) and Anointing of the Sick. Only bishops can administer <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> of Holy Orders, which ordains someone into the clergy.|$|E
50|$|There {{are seven}} <b>sacraments</b> of <b>the</b> Catholic Church, which {{according}} to Catholic theology were instituted by Jesus and entrusted to <b>the</b> Church. <b>Sacraments</b> are visible rites seen as signs and efficacious channels of the grace of God {{to all those who}} receive them with the proper disposition. The sevenfold list of sacraments is often organized into three groups: <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> of initiation (into the Church, the body of Christ), consisting of Baptism, Confirmation, and <b>the</b> Eucharist; <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> of healing, consisting of Penance and Anointing of the Sick; and <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> of service: Holy Orders and Matrimony.|$|R

50|$|The WCCAC administers <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> of Baptism, Confirmation, the Holy Eucharist, Reconciliation, Marriage, Holy Orders and of Extreme Unction (Last Rites). Each Ecclesiastical Province determines its own ritual for {{the celebration}} of <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> in {{accordance}} with the situation and local cultural context.|$|R
5|$|Early Reformed theologians such as John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli {{rejected}} the medieval belief in transubstantiation, that {{the bread and}} wine of the Eucharist change into Christ's body and blood, but taught that Christ's person, including his body and blood, are presented to Christians who partake of it in faith. They also disagree with Martin Luther and the Lutheran tradition which taught that Christ's body is physically eaten with the mouth in <b>the</b> <b>sacrament.</b> Later Reformed orthodox theologians continued to teach views {{similar to that of}} Calvin and Zwingli. In the modern period, Karl Barth espoused a symbolic view that <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> only communicates God's promises rather than functioning to actually confer these promises. Other Reformed theologians continued to teach the traditional view.|$|E

5|$|Women {{are active}} and play key roles in {{organizing}} activities and administering {{them in the}} Church. Female office holders are always head of groups of women and not groups of men. A deaconess can help pastors and deacons, but cannot herself administer <b>the</b> <b>sacrament.</b> All members of the ministerial hierarchy are paid for their services {{as part of the}} tithe by the congregational members.|$|E
5000|$|While the Church {{itself is}} <b>the</b> {{universal}} <b>sacrament</b> of salvation, <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> of <b>the</b> Catholic Church {{in the strict sense}} are seven sacraments that [...] "touch all the stages {{and all the}} important moments of Christian life: they give birth and increase, healing and mission to the Christian's life of faith". [...] "The Church affirms that for believers <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> of <b>the</b> New Covenant are necessary for salvation", although not all are necessary for every individual, and has placed under anathema those who deny it: [...] "If any one saith, that <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> of <b>the</b> New Law are not necessary unto salvation, but superfluous; and that, without them, or without the desire thereof, men obtain of God, through faith alone, the grace of justification;-though all (<b>the</b> <b>sacraments)</b> are not ineed necessary for every individual; let him be anathema." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{point is}} that in the Roman Catholic tradition, faith life moves around Sacraments. Any {{religious}} experience will be evaluated whether it enhances the devotion to <b>the</b> <b>Sacraments,</b> or it derails the person from <b>the</b> <b>Sacraments.</b> <b>The</b> authenticity will be judged based on the inner direction that lows out as a result of  the religious experience. </div...|$|R

5|$|In Reformed churches, only believing Christians are {{expected}} to partake of the Lord's Supper. Further, partakers {{are expected}} to examine and prepare themselves for <b>the</b> <b>sacrament.</b> This involves determining whether one acknowledges their sinfulness and has faith in Christ to forgive them. Christians may have some degree of doubt regarding their salvation, but they are at least {{to be aware of}} their sin and have a desire to have faith.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> of {{initiation}} into the visible church, or body {{of people who}} publicly claim faith in Christ. Baptism also signifies regeneration and remission of sin. Reformed Christians believe that the children of those who express faith in Christ should be baptized. Because baptism {{is believed to be}} beneficial only to those who have faith in Christ, infants are baptized {{on the basis of the}} promise of faith which will come to fruition later in life.|$|E

50|$|The Church {{teaches that}} the effect of <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> comes ex opere operato, by the very fact of being administered, {{regardless}} of the personal holiness of the minister administering it. However, as indicated in this definition of <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> given by <b>the</b> Catechism of the Catholic Church, a recipient's own lack of proper disposition to receive the grace conveyed can block a sacrament's effectiveness in that person. <b>The</b> <b>sacraments</b> presuppose faith and through their words and ritual elements, nourish, strengthen and give expression to faith.|$|R

5|$|The {{abolition}} of papal authority made way not for orderly change, but for dissension and violence. Iconoclasm, destruction, disputes within communities {{that led to}} violence, and radical challenge to all forms of faith were reported daily to Cromwell—developments he tried {{to hide from the}} King. Once Henry knew what was afoot, he acted. Thus at the end of 1538, a proclamation was issued forbidding free discussion of <b>the</b> <b>Sacrament</b> and forbidding clerical marriage, on pain of death.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli's {{views on}} baptism are largely rooted in his {{conflict}} with the Anabaptists, a group whose beliefs included the rejection of infant baptism and centered on the leadership of Conrad Grebel and Felix Manz. In October 1523, {{the controversy over the}} issue broke out during the second Zürich disputation and Zwingli vigorously defended the need for infant baptism and his belief that rebaptism was unnecessary. His major works on the subject include Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism (1525), A Reply to Hubmaier (1525), A Refutation (1527), and Questions Concerning <b>the</b> <b>Sacrament</b> of Baptism (1530).|$|E
5|$|Because {{remarriage}} {{was often}} {{thought to be}} a sacrilege—common belief (contrary to the Gospel – Luke 20:27–40 and Matthew 22:29–30) was that <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> of marriage extended beyond death—it was censured by the community. Thus the purpose of the Bal des Ardents was twofold: to entertain the court and to humiliate and rebuke Isabeau's lady-in-waiting—in an inherently pagan manner, which the Monk of St Denis seemed to dislike. A ritual burning on the wedding night of a woman who was remarrying had Christian origins as well, according to Veenstra. The Book of Tobit partly concerns a woman who had seven husbands murdered by the demon Asmodeus; she is eventually freed of the demon by the burning of the heart and liver of a fish.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} entitled: A Descriptive Assessment of Sacraments as Language Events in Louis-Marie Chauvet and David Noel Power. What motivates the author {{to proceed with}} this topic is that the author feels the need of finding a new and {{creative}} approach to <b>the</b> <b>sacraments.</b> <b>The</b> author is determined to discuss this topic using the methodology of library reading. The two theologians whose theologies are being presented in this paper, namely, Louis-Marie Chauvet and David Noel Power, are the main sources. In addition to reading the works of Chauvet and Power, the author also gets into discussions with the supervisor. Since Chauvet and Power live in postmodern world, their theology can be of the good readings for students of theology {{who are interested in}} the theology of <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> in <b>the</b> midst of this ever-changing world. Chauvet, for example, proposes a new looking into <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> as language of the Trinitarian communication with his people. The church is the place where this interaction happens. The interaction itself occurs through the listening of <b>the</b> Scripture, <b>sacraments</b> and ethical commitment. In the same rhythm, David Noel Power suggests a theology where <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> are read as the language of God’s giving. They are the language of God’s giving because the church is the bodily present of the Trinity in the church. This present is, in turn, celebrated and relived through <b>the</b> Scripture, <b>the</b> <b>sacraments,</b> liturgy, rite, customs and cultures. Through all these elements, the language of God’s giving in the past is brought to life in the present time through the language of the church. Chauvet and Power recommend a fundamental theology through which <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> are no longer viewed as alienated from the daily experience of the church. The paper is written primarily as the author’s personal journey into the reflection on <b>the</b> <b>sacraments.</b> <b>The</b> author, therefore, hopes to achieve nothing more important than the growing of a personal love of <b>the</b> <b>sacraments.</b> In <b>the</b> second place, the author expects {{to have been able to}} introduce <b>the</b> fundamental <b>sacraments</b> of Louis-Marie Chauvet and David Noel Power to a larger context...|$|R
