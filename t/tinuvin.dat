40|$|<b>Tinuvin</b> 770 [bis(2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 4 -piperidinyl) sebacate], is a UV light {{stabilizer}} plastic additive used worldwide. It is {{a component}} of many plastic materials used in medical and food industries. Earlier studies demonstrated its in vitro L-type Ca 2 + channel and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor blocking properties. Our previous experiments have proved the toxic effects of <b>Tinuvin</b> 770 on isolated rat cardiomyocytes. The present study investigates the cardiotoxic effects of <b>Tinuvin</b> 770 in vivo. Wistar rats were intraperitoneally injected with increasing doses of <b>Tinuvin</b> 770 (1, 10, 100 microg, and 1 mg) 15 times during a 5 -week period. Myocardial samples were analyzed by light, electron, and fluorescent microscopy. The lead-acetate method was used to detect intracellular Ca 2 +, and glyoxylic acid technique to assess alteration in adrenergic innervation. Focal myocytolysis and hypercontraction necrosis could be observed in rats treated with higher doses of <b>Tinuvin</b> 770. In these groups, intracellular Ca 2 + accumulation and increased catecholamine release were detected. <b>Tinuvin</b> 770 not only displays L-type Ca 2 + channel blocking properties, but {{can also lead to}} catecholamine release, similar to effects of the first generation of L-type Ca 2 + channel blockers. Morphological results correspond to catecholamine-induced myocardial damage. Current literature, as well as our study, indicates that more detailed toxicological analysis of <b>Tinuvin</b> 770 should be required, and current regulations in medical and food industries should adopt the new results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Paint Spray is {{developed}} as a direct sampling ionisation method for mass spectrometric analysis of additives in poly-mer-based surface coatings. The technique simply involves applying an external high voltage (5 kV) to the wetted sample {{placed in front of}} the mass spectrometer inlet and represents a much simpler ionisation technique compared to those currently available. The capabilities of Paint Spray are demonstrated herein with the detection of four commercially available hindered amine light stabilisers; <b>TINUVIN</b> ® 770, <b>TINUVIN</b> ® 292, <b>TINUVIN</b> ® 123 and <b>TINUVIN</b> ® 152 directly from thermoset polyester-based coil coatings. Paint Spray requires no sample preparation or pre-treatment and combined with its simplicity – requiring no special-ised equipment – makes it ideal for use by non-specialists. The application of Paint Spray for industrial use has significant poten-tial as sample collection from a coil coating production line and Paint Spray ionisation could enable fast quality control screening at high sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Despite several {{excellent}} properties including low shrinkage, good chemical resistance, curable at {{low temperatures}} {{and the absence}} of byproducts or volatiles, epoxy resins are susceptible to ultra violet (UV) damage and their durability is reduced substantially when exposed to outdoor environments. To overcome this drawback, UV absorbers have been usually used to decrease the rate of UV degradation. In this present study, the effects of UV light on the chemical, mechanical and physical properties of cured epoxy structure, as well as the effect of an organic UV absorber, <b>Tinuvin</b> 1130, on the epoxy properties were investigated. Chemical changes in a cured epoxy system {{as a result of the}} presence and absence of <b>Tinuvin</b> 1130 were determined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analyses. The effect of <b>Tinuvin</b> 1130 on the surface morphology of the epoxy systems was also investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. Additionally, the glass transition temperatures (Tg) before and during UV radiation were measured. After an 800 h UV radiation, mechanical test results revealed that the lack of the UV absorber can lead to a ~ 30 % reduction in tensile strength. However, in the presence of <b>Tinuvin</b> 1130, the tensile strength was reduced only by ~ 11 %. It was hypothesized that the use of <b>Tinuvin</b> 1130, as an organic UV absorber in the epoxy-amine system, could decrease the undesirable effects, arising from exposure to UV light...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An almost 5 -fold {{decrease}} of Stokes resonance Raman intensities is observed after the ultrafast proton transfer reaction cycle of <b>TINUVIN</b> and {{identified as an}} effect of vibrational excitation. Based on transform theory, characteristic features occurring in the time-dependence of Stokes as well as anti-Stokes resonance Raman intensities are calculated from the time-dependent transient absorption band shapes. After ultrafast photochemical reactions like intramolecular electron and proton transfer, or more in general, internal conversion, {{a considerable amount of}} excess energy is dumped into the vibrational subsystem of the molecule and subsequently redistributed among its vibrational degrees of freedom. For example, an ultrafast proton transfer cycle of 2 -(2 ’-hydroxy- 5 ’-methyl-phenyl) benzotriazole (<b>TINUVIN),</b> which is already completed within about 1 ps, leads to an excess energy of about 30000 cm- 1 [1]. Such an energy corresponds to a maximum possible equilibrium temperature of about 1200 K. Thermalization within the molecule is achieved not earlier than 7 ps after the reaction cycle. In about 30 ps the vibrational temperature drops to 400 K [2].

Several products were identified and quantified using a combination of GC-MS and GC-FID techniques. The photodegradation mechanisms of I and II were found to be consistent with the phenacyl and ketyl pathways from which products were generated via oxidation, heterocoupling, H-abstraction and homocoupling reactions. In the presence of the inhibitors, some of these reaction pathways were minimized and others eliminated. In decreasing order, the <b>Tinuvin</b> P/Tempo pair were the most effective in protecting the models against photodegradation followed by MDHB and DHB. A synergistic photostabilization effect was also observed between <b>Tinuvin</b> P and the antioxidant, but was not retained during irradiation, probably due to the low regeneration rate of Tempo on the matrix. The photostabilization effectiveness of MDHB can be related to the cooperative action of its UV absorbing, hydrogen donating and oxygen scavenging functionalities. However, the separation of product 12 from MDHB was not possible by GC and the photo-chemical fate of MDHB remains undetermined. No synergism was found between MDHB and Tempo.

40|$|Stabilisers, {{commonly}} hindered phenolic antioxidants (AO) and hindered amine light stabilisers (HALS), {{are added}} to protect polyolefins against thermo- and photo-oxidative degradation. Analysing the content of additives in polyolefin compounds or their residual stability is therefore essential to identify changes in these parameters {{as a result of}} application. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the oxidation induction time (OIT) are currently used for this purpose. In the case of polyolefin pipes concentration profiles of additives over the pipe wall can be obtained by mechanically abrasing layers and individually analysing these by HPLC and OIT. This approach is very labour intensive and, has a lower spatial resolution, and additionally a lower reproducibility. Pipes are often exposed to different weathering conditions, either as semifinished product before installation or in final outdoor use. The elemental processes during weathering of polyethylene, i. e. extraction of antioxidants from the polymer and oxidation of the polymer, have been studied using the traditional aproach. However due to the mentioned deficits the data are insufficient {{and as a result of}} that these processes have not yet been correlated to the conditions of weathering. Therefore, the aim of this research project was, to develop an analytical method that allows to follow the degradation processes in the pipe wall during weathering. Particular focus was on the influence of UV radiation in the depletion of the phenolic long-term stabiliser, Irganox 1010. IR-microscopy which combines the image analysis specificity of light microscopy with the chemical specificity of IR-spectroscopy fulfils the above requirements giving novel information about these elemental processes. Namely it is able to profile the concentration of antioxidants, degradation products of the polymer and the crystallinity of the pipe wall. Pipes made from high density polyethylene (HDPE) were weathered under different climatic conditions. The pipes were stabilised with Irganox 1010 as phenolic AO and Irgafos 168 as processing stabiliser. To study the influence of different UV and light stabilising additives, additional pipes were stabilised with <b>Tinuvin</b> 327 as UV absorber, <b>Tinuvin</b> 770 as HALS, and with carbon black (CB). Using IR-microscopy it could be shown that a loss of Irganox 1010 occurs upon weathering, with its extent depending on the climate chosen. It could be concluded that both temperature and UV radiation are the primary influence factors while humidity is of minor significance. To investigate in detail the correlation between the exposure to UV radiation and the loss of Irganox 1010, samples were exposed to artificial weathering. It was found that the loss of AO as determined by IR-microscopy and integrated over the pipe wall correlates linearily with the radiation dose. From the slope of the straight line the corresponding rate constants were calculated for the first time. As expected significantly higher values were found for the side exposed to radiation than for the unexposed one. The disappearance of vinyl unsaturations originally present in PE, as well as the formation of trans-vinylene groups as unsaturated degradation products of PE, could also be quantified. The disappearance of vinyl unsaturations followed a first-order law and trans-vinylene unsaturations were formed proportionate to the dose of UV radiation on the side exposed to the radiation. At the same time the degree of crystallinity of the pipe remains unaffected and no breakdown of the molar mass occurs as shown by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). HPLC analysis showed that the ratio of phosphite/phosphate decreases as a consequence of the exposure to UV radiation while the content of Irgafos 168 – i. e. the sum of phosphite and phosphate - remains constant. Due to the fact that the phosphate has an absorption band which overlaps with the absorption band used to quantify the trans-vinylene groups, a new approach to calculate the amount of Irgafos and, following that, the content of trans-vinylene groups, was developed. Adding a combination of the UV absorber <b>Tinuvin</b> 327 and the HALS <b>Tinuvin</b> 770 had no measurable effect on the loss of Irganox 1010. Interestingly HPLC analysis showed that <b>Tinuvin</b> 770 is also lost as a result of the UV exposure but to a lower extent than Irganox 1010. For the case of <b>Tinuvin</b> 327 no loss is observed as a result of the UV exposure. In this study was also shown by IR-microscopy, that the presence of CB significantly prevents the loss of Irganox 1010.

Thus, {{two types of}} light stabilizers, <b>Tinuvin</b> P and Chimassorb 119 FL, were used to improve the ABS endurance against UV. Stabilized ABS samples were submitted to accelerated weathering in a Xenontest 150 S chamber, according to standard methods, in order to predict copolymer lifetime within a commercially acceptable time period. Infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance accessory (FTIR-ATR) was used to follow chemical modifications that occur on the material surface {{as a consequence of}} degradation process. While non-stabilized ABS samples loose the butadiene component in the first 22 h of exposure, in stabilized samples submitted to same accelerated conditions this component only disappears after 150 h of exposure. Non-stabilized and stabilized ABS samples present a similar yellowing behavior, a gradually increase with exposure time. Nevertheless, as expected, color modifications are less pronounced for stabilized ABS samples.

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} {{polymers}} {{made from}} renewable materials has been developed in diverse areas especially in furniture, mattresses, automotive or building components. Polyurethanes (PU's) made from renewable materials {{are one of the}} most important groups of polymers because of their versatility and they can be manufactured in a wide range of grades, densities and stiffness. In this project, polymers based on renewable materials such as rapeseed (RS) and sunflower oil (SF) were synthesized and cross-linked with methylene di-/>-phenyl diisocyanate (MDI) to form polyurethanes. Treatment with titanium dioxide (TiCh) was found to affect the physical properties of the polyurethane in a systematic way. As the loadings of TiOj were increased (up to 10 % of monomer weight), large strain responses were obtained; thus the stress vs. strain curves plotted by the Instron tensile test showed an increase from 5 % to 31 %). This study also revealed a remarkable characteristic in the pigmented polymer exhibiting soft - but - tough behaviour at high TiC> 2 loading. The DMTA test also showed that the properties of the sample loaded with 10 % TiC> 2 increased its tan delta peak (damping factor) from 0. 43 to 0. 7. The tan delta peak showed that the damping properties of the material were improved markedly upon loading with TiC> 2. This is useful since noise is radiated by vibration, and the application of damping materials to the vibrating surface converts the energy into heat, which is dissipated within the damping materials rather than being radiated as airborne noise. Increase in TiC> 2 loading also gave a progressive increase of hardness (Shore D) for both RS and SF oil - based polyurethanes. The effect of prolonged exposure to UVB light, in general promotes photodegradation for both RS and SF-based polyurethanes, both neat and also material loaded with TiCh- The photodegradation of the PU's depends on the grade of titanium dioxide. The addition of 10 % Degussa P 25 pigment, gives the greater degradation while PUs loaded with 5 % Kronos 2220 show the slowest rates of degradation due to the effect of the coating of this pigment. The photostabiliser <b>Tinuvin</b> 770 also offers high protection from UVB, while the combination of <b>Tinuvin</b> 770 and Degussa P 25 gave the highest protection from UVB.

40|$|International audienceTo better {{understand}} the degradation of cellulose upon {{the formation of a}} tideline at the wet–dry interface when paper is suspended in water, the production of chemical species involved in oxidation reactions was studied. The quantitation of hydroperoxides and hydroxyl radicals was carried out in reverse phase chromatography using triphenylphosphine and terephthalic acid, respectively, as chemical probes. Both reactive oxygen species were found in the tideline immediately after its formation, in the range of micro-moles and nanomoles per gram of paper, respectively. The results indicate that hydroxyl radicals form for the most part in paper before the tideline experiment, whereas hydroperoxides appear to be produced primarily during tideline formation. Iron sulfate impregnation of the paper raised the production of hydroperoxides. After hygrothermal aging in sealed vials the hydroxyl radical content in paper increased significantly. When aged together in the same vial, tideline samples strongly influenced the degradation of samples from other areas of the paper (multi-sample aging).

This enhancement of the HALS recovery is attributed mainly to the preferential exposure of the HALS {{on the surface of the}} ground PP sample through the interaction between the polymeric HALS and the flame retardant in the molten PP during kneading. In spite of such a considerable action of the flame retardant, the observed intensities of the characteristic peaks of HALS by RTD-GC showed a good linear relationship with the HALS content in the PP samples with constant content of the flame retardant (50 phr); this relationship could be used as the calibration line for the determination of the polymeric HALS in the PP materials containing the flame retardant...|$|E
40|$|High {{performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) {{was used for}} the fractionation of extracts from polypropylene (PP) films and coupled on-line to gas chromatography (GC) with automated transfer of the complete HPLC fractions (comprehensive on-line HPLC-GC, i. e. HPLCxGC). Flame ionization detection (FID) {{was used for the}} estimation of concentrations, mass spectrometry (MS) for identification work. This method was applied to investigate whether pulsed light (PL) treatment for the microbiological decontamination of polypropylene packaging materials produces reaction products requiring an evaluation to meet regulatory requirements. To demonstrate the safety of PL treatments with regard to the formation of reaction products, i. e. that no component is formed that could endanger human health, basically comprehensive analysis of components potentially migrating into food is required, but comprehensiveness cannot be proven and remains an approximation. The threshold concentration in the film was estimated either from the conventional European non-detection limit of 0. 01 mg/kg food or the concept of the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) for an unknown substance, i. e. an exposure to 0. 15 mu g per person and day. PL treatment of the films containing Irgafos 168 produced several new components exceeding these limits, i. e. a toxicological safety assessment would probably be required. No such peaks were detected for <b>Tinuvin</b> 326, Irganox 1076 and Chimassorb 81. No degradation of the polymer was detected...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{significant}} progress having been achieved {{in recent years}} to improve wood’s durability, additional developments are still necessary to increase its color stability. ZnO and CeO 2 nanoparticles were compared to UV absorbers (<b>Tinuvin</b> 477 DW, 292 and 5151) commonly used to stabilize the wood products color. Nanoparticles, with concentrations in the range 1 to 2 wt%, and UV absorbers, using concentrations advised by the manufacturer, were dispersed in a waterborne UV curable polyurethane/polyacrylate resin. Dispersions were carried out with a high speed mixer at 2, 500 RPM with micro glass beads or not, depending on the form of the nanoparticles. Nanocomposite coatings were aged with a weather-o-meter (CI 3000 + - Atlas) according ASTM G 155. Color variations were measured with a colorimeter (BYK Gardner – Color Guide 45 / 0) working with the CIE L*a*b* system. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the effects of inorganic UV absorbers on the stabilization of color under indoor conditions. Results showed that nanoparticles (ZnO, CeO 2) absorbed UV light frequencies in a manner similar to common organic molecules. Their efficiency was better at medium durations of light exposure, for which they could achieve the action of organic absorbers. Finally, the simultaneous use of both absorbers seems to create a protective synergy when degradation is due to UV energy alone...|$|E
40|$|Ultraviolet {{absorbers}} such as <b>Tinuvin</b> P (2 -(2 -hydroxy- 5 -methylphenyl) benzotriazole), 1, {{achieve their}} exceptional photostabilities {{as a result}} of deactivation of excited singlet states through excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). Adding a methyl group to the 6 ′ position of 2 -arylbenzotriazoles reveals an additional excited singlet state deactivation mechanism in this class of molecules which does not require intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Steady state fluorescence and fluorescence lifetime measurements for a series of 6 ′-methyl- 2 -arylbenzotriazoles provides compelling evidence for a twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) mechanism of excited singlet state deactivation. Due to the steric requirements of the 6 ′-methyl group, conformations are favored in which the phenyl and triazole rings are no longer coplanar. In the case of compound 11 (2 -(6 -methoxy- 2, 3 -dimethylphenyl) - 2 H-benzotriazole), the presence of a 2 ′-methoxy group enhances nonplanarity and results in large deactivation rates. Compound 12 (2 -(6 -methoxy- 2, 3 -dimethylphenyl) - 5 -(trifluoromethyl) - 2 H-benzotriazole), which possesses both twist and enhanced donor/acceptor properties, undergoes the most efficient fluorescence quenching for the methoxyarylbenzotriazoles. Compounds with both a 6 ′-methyl and a hydroxy group on the phenyl ring exhibit diffusion controlled quenching (kq) 2 1010 M- 1 s- 1) by DMSO. This quenching appears to result from either partial or complete excited state proton transfer to DMSO, which enhances TICT deactivation of the singlet excited state...|$|E
40|$|Detection and {{characterisation}} {{of structural}} modifications of a hindered amine light stabiliser (HALS) {{directly from a}} polyester-based coil coating have been achieved by desorption electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) for the first time. In situ detection is made possible by exposing the coating to an acetone vapour atmosphere prior to analysis. This is a gentle and non-destructive treatment that allows diffusion of analyte to the surface without promoting lateral migration. Using this approach a major structural modification of the HALS <b>TINUVIN</b> 123 (bis(1 -octyloxy- 2, 2, 6, 6 - tetramethyl- 4 -piperidyl) sebacate) was discovered where one N-ether piperidine moiety (N-OC 8 H 17) is converted to a secondary piperidine (N–H). With the use of 2 -dimensional DESI-MS imaging the modification was observed to arise during high curing temperatures (ca. 260 degrees C) and under simulated physiological conditions (80 degrees C, full solar spectrum). It is proposed that the secondary piperidine derivative {{is a result of}} a highly reactive aminyl radical intermediate produced by N–O homolytic bond cleavage. The nature of the bond cleavage is also suggested by ESR spin-trapping experiments employing a-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN) in toluene at 80 degrees C. The presence of a secondary piperidine derivative in situ and the implication of N–OR competing with NO–R bond cleavage suggest an alternative pathway for generation of the nitroxyl radical—an essential requirement in anti-oxidant activity that has not previously been described for the N-ether sub-class of HALS...|$|E
40|$|A {{pharmacologically}} {{active agent}} was easily extracted by aqueous or organic solvents from laboratory plastic tubes (Falcon Blue Max) {{and has been}} chemically identified as bis(2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 4 -piperidyl) sebacate. This compound (approximately 12 micrograms per tube approximately 25 nmol) blocked 1, 4 -dihydropyridine-sensitive 45 Ca 2 + uptake into GH 3 cells with an IC 50 value of 3. 6 microM, inhibited Sr 2 + currents through L-type Ca 2 + channels in A 7 r 5 smooth-muscle cells in whole-cell patch-clamp experiments after extracellular application, and affected the high-affinity binding of Ca 2 + entry-blocker ligands {{to a variety of}} preparations. Bis(2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 4 -piperidyl) sebacate is a highly potent (IC 50 values < 10 nM) inhibitor at the phenylalkylamine- and benzothiazepine-selective drug-binding domains of the alpha 1 subunit of L-type Ca 2 + channels. This compound behaves as a heterotropic allosteric regulator for the 1, 4 -dihydropyridine-selective domain in purified Ca(2 +) -channel preparations from rabbit skeletal muscle. (+) -Tetrandrine stimulation of 1, 4 -dihydropyridine binding to the membrane-bound L-type Ca 2 + channel is inhibited by the compound in a competitive manner (Ki value = 6. 8 nM). Bis(2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 4 -piperidyl) sebacate is therefore classified as the prototype of another class of L-type Ca(2 +) -channel blockers that binds to the alpha 1 subunit at the drug-binding domains selective for (+) -tetrandrine or (+) -cis-diltiazem. This compound is identical to <b>Tinuvin</b> 770, which is used worldwide as a light stabilizer for polyolefins...|$|E
40|$|A new {{photochromic}} organic inorganic nanocomposite (Nanomerw) {{coating system}} has been developed. It {{is based on an}} epoxysilane as network former, an organic bisepoxide as spacer, an organic amine as thermal cross linker and surface modi®ed SiO 2 nanoparticles as ®llers. This coating system is compatible with different photochromic dyes, like oxazines and pyrans. Photochromic coatings with blue, yellow, red, green, violet and neutral tints were prepared on ¯at glass and PMMA substrates by dip coating and cured for 3 h at 1008 C. The photochromic coatings show the following properties: the transmittance changes reversibly between 80 and 20 % with half fading times of about 2 20 s (comparable to the half fading time of the appropriate dye in ethanolic solution) after UV irradiation for 15 s with 5 mW/cm 2. The coatings show a scratch hardness of about 15 g (scratch test with Vickers indenter, coating thickness 10 mm). The addition of only 3 wt. % SiO 2 nanoparticles relative to epoxysilane increases the scratch resistance of the coatings to about 20 g without changing the fast kinetics of the incorporated photochromic dye(s). The long term stability of the photochromic dye(s) in the matrix system can be considerably improved by the introduction of additives like antioxidants, hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS) and UV stabilizers. The half lifetime (decay to 50 % of the initial photochromic intensity) of a blue spirooxazine dye (Blue A) measured in a dry sun test (75 mW/cm 2) could be increased from 20 h without any additive up to 200 h with an UV absorber (<b>Tinuvin</b> 327) as a stabilizer, which is assumed to be suf®cient for ophthalmic applications...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dental {{restorative}} materials containing silver-mercury compounds {{have been}} known to induce oral lichenoid lesions. Objectives: To determine the frequency of contact allergy to dental restoration materials in patients with oral lichenoid lesions and to study the effect of removal of the materials on the lesions. Results: Forty-five patients were recruited in three groups of 15 each: Group A (lesions in close contact with dental materials), Group B (lesions extending 1 cm beyond the area of contact) and Group C (no topographic relationship). Thirty controls were recruited in two groups of 15 individuals each: Group D (oral lichenoid lesions but no dental material) and Group E (dental material but no oral lichenoid lesions). Patch tests were positive in 20 (44. 5 %) patients. Mercury was the most common allergen to elicit a positive reaction in eight patients, followed by nickel (7), palladium (5), potassium dichromate (3), balsam of Peru, gold sodium thiosulphate 2 and <b>tinuvin</b> (2) and eugenol (1), cobalt chloride (1) and carvone (1). Seven patients elicited positive response to more than one allergen. In 13 of 20 patients who consented to removal of the dental material, complete healing was observed in 6 (30 %), marked improvement in 7 (35 %) and no improvement in 7 (35 %) patients. Relief of symptoms was usually observed 3 months after removal. Limitations: Limited number of study subjects and short follow up after removal/replacement of dental restoration materials are the main limitations of this study. Conclusion: Contact allergy to amalgam is an important etiologic factor in oral lichenoid lesions and removal of restorative material should be offered to patients who have lesions in close proximity to the dental material...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{generate}} small structures is central to modern science and technology. In this work, four laser direct-write microfabrication and micropatterning techniques were studied: (a) Laser micromachining of channels in PMMA using a CO 2 laser was investigated experimentally and theoretically. Heat transfer models for the channel depth, channel profile, laser power and scanning speed were developed and applied in this work. These models, are in excellent agreement with experimental results, with a maximum deviation of approximately 5 % for the range of experimental parameters (laser power, scanning speed) tested. (b) A sub-micrometer resolution laser direct-write polymerization system for creating two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures was developed using a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser. Experimental studies and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to understand the detailed microscale optical scattering, chemical reaction, polymerization, and their influence on critical fabrication parameters. The experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical model. (c) Direct laser interference was developed for rapid and large area fabrication of two-dimensional and three dimensional periodic structures on photopolymerizable materials with 10 ns pulses from a frequency-tripled Nd:YAG laser emitting at 355 nm. Three different photopolymerizable materials were investigated: pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETIA) with photoinitiator N-methyldiethanolamine (N-MDEA); SU- 8 with absorber <b>TINUVIN</b> 384 - 2; and Shipley 1813. (d) A new approach to fabricating nanometer sized cavity arrays on Poly(3, 4 -ethylene dioxythiophene) -poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) thin films using laser-assisted near-field pattering was investigated. Periodic nano-cavity arrays were patterned by combining direct laser interference technology and laser induced near-field technology. An analytical model based on Mie theory was developed, the predicted intensity distributions on the substrate indicate a strong near-field enhancement confined to a very small area (nanometer scale) ...|$|E
40|$|João Vieira (1934 - 2009) was an {{important}} avant-garde artist. He {{was responsible for the}} first art performance in Portugal. One of the undoubted hallmarks of its vast artistic production was his material experimentalism. One example of this characteristic emerged in the late 60 s, when João Vieira started to create somes pieces with polyurethane foams. This paper intends to present a conservation study for one of João Viera’s piece produced in the 1980 's in projected rigid polyurethane foam. Given the poor condition of this piece (crumbling foam and material flaws), it was imperative to carry out a conservation study. For that, the object was characterized by stereomicroscope, optical microscopy, infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy spectroscopy dispersive X-ray; and foam consolidation and its stabilization studies were carried out. Due to the lack of existing studies that focus on the treatment of polyurethane rigid foams, an artificial aging (UV-Vis radiation) was carried out for reference samples after treatment, following a proposal described by Thea van Oosten for polyurethane flexible foams - mixture of Impranil® DLV/ 1 (consolidant) and <b>Tinuvin</b> B 75 (stabilizer). To enable a good control and homogeneity of the treatment application, a facing was applied. However, this approach has resulted in a low surface penetration and a layer showing different mechanical properties. The ageing experiment was assessed by stereomicroscope, optical microscope and FTIR. After aging, the treatment proved to be effective in the inhibition of photooxidation and in the aggregation of foam particles. For this reason, its application on the artwork is being considered. Finally, it is important to stress out the need for a continued study that will allow to extend further knowledge about polyurethane rigid foam degradation, allowing the conservation of {{an important}} and large collection in foam by João Vieir...|$|E
