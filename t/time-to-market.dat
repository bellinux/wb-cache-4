5|$|Innovation management: The {{value of}} the {{coordinating}} role of design in new product development has been well documented. Design management can help to improve innovation management, which can be measured by three variables: it reduces <b>time-to-market,</b> by improving sources and communication skills and developing cross-functional innovation; it stimulates networking innovation, by managing product and customer information flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it improves the learning process by promoting a continuous learning process.|$|E
25|$|Maintainability: Maintainability {{includes}} {{the notion of}} adaptability, portability and transferability (from one development team to another). Measuring and monitoring maintainability is a must for mission-critical applications where change is driven by tight <b>time-to-market</b> schedules {{and where it is}} important for IT to remain responsive to business-driven changes. It is also essential to keep maintenance costs under control.|$|E
25|$|They {{also may}} claim {{that because it}} is compact and terse, APL lends itself well to larger-scale {{software}} development and complexity, {{because the number of}} lines of code can be dramatically reduced. Many APL advocates and practitioners also view standard programming languages such as COBOL and Java as being comparatively tedious. APL is often found where <b>time-to-market</b> is important, such as with trading systems.|$|E
25|$|Simulation {{solutions}} are being increasingly integrated with CAx (CAD, CAM, CAE....) solutions and processes. The use of simulation throughout the product lifecycle, {{especially at the}} earlier concept and design stages, {{has the potential of}} providing substantial benefits. These benefits range from direct cost issues such as reduced prototyping and shorter <b>time-to-market,</b> to better performing products and higher margins. However, for some companies, simulation has not provided the expected benefits.|$|E
25|$|Despite this critique, {{reengineering}} {{was adopted}} at an accelerating pace and by 1993, {{as many as}} 60% of the Fortune 500 companies claimed to either have initiated reengineering efforts, or to have plans to do so. This trend was fueled by the fast adoption of BPR by the consulting industry, {{but also by the}} study Made in America, conducted by MIT, that showed how companies in many US industries had lagged behind their foreign counterparts in terms of competitiveness, <b>time-to-market</b> and productivity.|$|E
25|$|Much of upland Georgia was {{developed}} as {{what became known}} as the Black Belt, named for the fertile soil. Planters brought or purchased many enslaved African Americans as workers for the labor-intensive crop. The leading Cherokee participated in the cultivation of cotton as a commodity crop, which soon replaced deer-skin trading as a source of wealth in the region. The first steamboat navigated the Coosa River to Rome in 1836, reducing the <b>time-to-market</b> for the cotton trade and speeding travel between Rome and New Orleans on the Gulf Coast, the major port for export of cotton.|$|E
25|$|Unbalanced {{demographics}} and lopsided Employment-to-population ratio {{has resulted in}} extension of the retirement age, applied budgetary pressure on social security & welfare service systems (medicare, pensions), and accelerated rural depopulation. Increasing skill-erosion of the employable workforce due to technology evolutions is impacting all segments of value-addition. Stiff competition for market-access and ever-growing difficulties to retain market-shares in the global arena is impacting businesses {{who are unable to}} afford the sustained capital investment requirements for continuous product development, quicker <b>time-to-market</b> and superior customer management. Constraints linked to continuous skills-development and latencies in transforming legacy processes, technologies and infrastructure have had a direct impact on employment and market opportunities.|$|E
2500|$|Production of salt did not {{retain its}} lucrative luster for long, however, for {{downward}} price pressures had hit that industry from several angles. For one, {{the completion of}} the Erie Canal in 1830 meant a sharp increase in competition from companies that were mining massive salt deposits in Syracuse, New York. [...] Local competition had increased as well – by 1837, Provincetown had 78 saltworks, and the selling price had fallen from a high of eight dollars per bushel {{at the turn of the}} nineteenth century, down to only one dollar. Around that same time, demand for salt-cured fish began to decline, yielding to a growing consumer preference for ice harvesting and storage. [...] John Atwood Jr., the son of Long Point's founder, boasted that [...] "In 1848 I brought the first mackerel ever received on ice to Boston. It was August. I took them in the sloop smack American Eagle." [...] He later pioneered the use of a jib topsail to shorten his <b>time-to-market,</b> so as to meet the growing appetite for fresh-caught fish.|$|E

5000|$|The {{duplicate}} code base doubles {{the time}} required to implement changes which may be desired across both products; this increases <b>time-to-market</b> for such changes, and may in fact wipe out any time gains achieved by branching the code in the first place.|$|E
50|$|The success behind {{concurrent}} design and manufacturing lies within completing processes {{at the same}} time while involving all disciplines. As product development has become more cost and time efficient over the years, elements of concurrent engineering have been present in product development approaches. The elements of concurrent engineering that were utilized were cross-functional teams as well as fast <b>time-to-market</b> and considering manufacturing processes when designing. By involving multiple disciplines in decision making and planning, concurrent engineering has made product development more cost and time efficient. The fact that concurrent engineering could result in faster <b>time-to-market</b> is already an important advantage in terms of a competitive edge over other producers. Concurrent engineering has provided a structure and concept for product development that can be implemented for future success.|$|E
50|$|The {{decision}} of which peripheral to integrate is often difficult. The microcontroller vendors often trade operating frequencies and system design flexibility against <b>time-to-market</b> requirements from their customers and overall lower system cost.
