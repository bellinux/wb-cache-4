25|$|Agriculture, {{dominated}} by banana production, {{is the most}} important sector of this lower-middle-income economy. The services sector, based mostly on a growing tourist industry, is also important. The government has been relatively unsuccessful at introducing new industries, and the unemployment rate remains high at 19.8% in the 1991 census to 15% in 2001. The continuing dependence on a single crop represents <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>obstacle</b> to the islands' development as tropical storms wiped out substantial portions of bananas in many years.|$|E

25|$|In 1838, Brisbane {{was opened}} up to free settlers, one of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>obstacle</b> to its {{expansion}} {{at the time was}} the Brisbane River. In February 1842, the first real wave of settlers up the river followed the proclamation of the free settlement of Moreton Bay District. Only a fitful rowboat ferry connected North Brisbane to the more industrial settlement of Kangaroo Point, and another to South Brisbane, which became known particularly for its wayfaring inns. Early settlers crossing the river by row boats often had their horse swimming behind.|$|E
25|$|Pre-combustion CO2 removal is {{much easier}} than CO2 removal from flue gas in {{post-combustion}} capture due to the high concentration of CO2 after the water-gas-shift reaction and the high pressure of the syngas. During pre-combustion in IGCC, the partial pressure of CO2 is nearly 1000 times higher than in post-combustion flue gas. Due to the high concentration of CO2 pre-combustion, physical solvents, such as Selexol and Rectisol, are preferred {{for the removal of}} CO2 vs that of chemical solvents. Physical solvents work by absorbing the acid gases without the need of a chemical reaction as in traditional amine based solvents. The solvent can then be regenerated, and the CO2 desorbed, by reducing the pressure. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>obstacle</b> with physical solvents is the need for the syngas to be cooled before separation and reheated afterwards for combustion. This requires energy and decreases overall plant efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The {{high cost}} of IGCC is <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>obstacle</b> to its {{integration}} in the power market; however, most energy executives recognize that carbon regulation is coming soon. Bills requiring carbon reduction are being proposed again both the House and the Senate, and with the Democratic majority {{it seems likely that}} with the next President there will be a greater push for carbon regulation. The Supreme Court decision requiring the EPA to regulate carbon (Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency et al.) also speaks to the likelihood of future carbon regulations coming sooner, rather than later. With carbon capture, the cost of electricity from an IGCC plant would increase approximately 33%. For a natural gas CC, the increase is approximately 46%. For a pulverized coal plant, the increase is approximately 57%. This potential for less expensive carbon capture makes IGCC an attractive choice for keeping low cost coal an available fuel source in a carbon constrained world. However, the industry needs a lot more experience to reduce the risk premium. IGCC with CCS requires some sort of mandate, higher carbon market price, or regulatory framework to properly incentivize the industry.|$|E

25|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>obstacle</b> {{to higher}} {{education}} for women is the physical and cultural distance of the universities from Negev Bedouin towns. Even the nearest universities require significant travel time to and from campus. In many instances, Bedouin women are only permitted {{to make the trip}} if accompanied by a male relative. Moreover, the university is a very different cultural space than Negev Bedouin towns. Jewish-Israeli culture is largely modern and secular, as opposed to the traditional, religious culture in Negev Bedouin society. This pronounced cultural difference is both an obstacle to enrolling at universities and a challenge women must overcome once they arrive. Additionally, societal pressure to marry young can conflict with attaining a university education. While there have been cases where women could attain a university education after marrying, the familial responsibilities (childcare and housework, for instance) provide additional challenges to completing their studies. Further, studying after marriage is entirely dependent upon the approval of the women's husbands. In other words, women are always dependent upon male consent for their studies, either from their fathers (or other male guardians) or their husbands. Finally, the lack of female employment opportunities means that studying at a university {{does not seem to be}} a reasonable investment, especially in instances where family resources are limited.|$|E
25|$|A {{full-length}} runway {{extension to}} accommodate long-haul international flights {{has been previously}} investigated, but would require expensive land reclamation into Lyall Bay, and massive breakwater protection from Cook Strait. Doubts have existed over the viability of such an undertaking, particularly as Air New Zealand has repeatedly indicated {{that it has no}} interest in pursuing international service beyond Australia and the Pacific Islands, and few international airlines have shown serious interest in providing services beyond those points. Air New Zealand has questioned potential demand for such flights, citing the axing of its Christchurch-Los Angeles route in early 2006. Regional business organisations and the airport have put forward their case to various international airlines for long-haul operations to and from Wellington, pointing out that Christchurch's economy is mainly industrial and agricultural, while arguing that Wellington's economy is based mainly on {{what they see as the}} higher-value public service, financial, ICT, and creative sectors. In particular, a survey commissioned by the Wellington Chamber of Commerce found that respondents regarded the airport's limited international capacity as <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>obstacle</b> to the Wellington region's economic potential, by a long margin over other factors. It has also been pointed out that while Air New Zealand has been scaling back certain routes, it is adding others, most notably Auckland-Shanghai from 6 November 2006.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>obstacle</b> to the plan's {{implementation}} soon {{proved to}} be the Berlin Blockade [...] by the USSR, which was followed by a western counter-blockade of the Soviet occupation zone. As there were long-established economic ties between the western zone and the eastern, which was highly dependent on supplies from the West, the blockade was more damaging to the East. The West Berlin SPD newspaper Sozialdemokrat reported in April 1949, how Rau clearly criticized the blockade in a meeting of SED apparatchiks and {{there is reason to believe}} that he did the same in the meetings with the SMAD. According to the paper, Rau spoke of a [...] "bad speculation" [...] regarding the undervaluation of the dependence on western supplies, stating that the [...] "broadminded Soviet help" [...] turned out as insufficient and hinting that the blockade would soon be lifted. Finally the Berlin Blockade was lifted on 12May 1949.|$|E

[...] O’Malley said [...] "I have concluded that discriminating against individuals based on their sexual orientation {{in the context of}} civil marital rights is unjust. I have also concluded that treating the children of families headed by same-sex couples with lesser protections under the law than the children of families headed by heterosexual parents, is also unjust." [...] On February 24, 2011, the Senate, which was thought to be <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>obstacle</b> to passage, approved the bill in a 25–21 vote. The House of Delegates proved to be a challenge, where same-sex marriage advocates struggled to gain support from social conservatives from Prince George's County, southern Maryland, and the Baltimore suburbs who cited religious concerns.|$|E
500|$|Often {{against the}} views of his superiors, Devers lobbied for a still more heavily armored and better armed medium tank, the M4 Sherman. He played an {{important}} role in the M4's design, development and manufacturing, particularly its engine and armament. Throughout his tour as Chief of the Armored Force he worked closely with the Ordnance Department, manufacturers and the Armored Force Board at Fort Knox on the research and testing of tanks, guns, armored vehicles and ammunition. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>obstacle</b> was engines.

500|$|British {{historian}} Robert Service {{wrote in}} his book, Russia: From Tsarism to the Twenty-First Century, that [...] "When he [...] succeeded Khrushchev, {{he was still a}} vigorous politician who expected to make the Party and government work more effectively. He had not been inactive; he had not been entirely inflexible. But his General Secretaryship had turned into a ceremonial reign that had brought communism into its deepest contempt since 1917." [...] He added that it was [...] "hard to feel very sorry for Brezhnev"; his socio-economic policies had sent the country into an Era of Stagnation from which his successors were never able to fully recover. Talal Nizameddin states in his book Russia and the Middle East: Towards A New Foreign Policy that [...] "Brezhnev's legacy, generally unaffected by his weak successors (Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko), was entanglement in Afghanistan, tension with China and Japan, as well as the prospect of a new dimension to the arms race with the United States {{in the form of the}} Strategic Defence Initiative (Star Wars)." [...] According to historian David Dyker in his book The Soviet Union under Gorbachev: Prospects for Reform [...] "Brezhnev left his successors a Soviet Union suffering from a host of domestic and foreign problems". <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>obstacle,</b> according to Dyker, was the weakness of the economy which had undermined Soviet influence outside its borders considerably during the late Brezhnev due to its relative technological backwardness.|$|E

2500|$|The Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963 was {{the result}} of eight years of negotiations, {{following}} a proposal for a ban on nuclear tests made by the Soviet Union in 1955. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>obstacle</b> to a treaty was the issue of verifying that all parties complied with it, and the Western powers were determined that any agreement reached could not be violated in a clandestine manner. One of the issues at stake was the possibility of disguising explosions in large underground chambers by decoupling the explosive from the rock. This idea was developed by Dr Albert Latter in 1959. With negotiations underway, some small-scale tests were made immediately to determine whether decoupling could work to disguise the size of an underground explosion. After an initial pair of small explosions in clay, a larger programme of testing was undertaken, first in the Excelsior Tunnel beneath Kit Hill in Cornwall, followed by larger explosions at a salt mine in Louisiana in the USA, and finally two explosions in solid andesite rock at Greenside Mine.
