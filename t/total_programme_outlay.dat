40|$|Background: Spending {{on medical}} care for {{patients}} in their last year of life accounts for over one-quarter of US Medicare <b>programme</b> <b>outlays.</b> While the magnitude of spending on end-of-life care is striking, {{it is difficult to}} determine if expenditures are wasteful or simply reflect the inherent uncertainty facing physicians. Methods: Using a sample of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, we document the association between mortality risk and end-of-life medical spending. Mortality risk at 1 year before death was estimated using a logistic model with age, sex and co-morbidities as covariates. Results: We found that, among decedents, end-of-life spending is inversely related to predicted mortality risk, ranging from $US 23 _ 000 for decedents with mortality risk in the interval 0. 00 - 0. 05 to $US 16 _ 000 for decedents with mortality risk > 0. 25 (1999 dollar values). In aggregate, > 50 % of Medicare spending on medical care in the last year of life is for beneficiaries with below-median mortality risk. Conclusions: We conclude that physicians treat patients who are likely to die differently than those who are not. Substituting palliative for curative care for patients with unfavourable prognoses may lower total expenditures, but probably not as much as commonly expected. Cost-analysis, Mortality...|$|R

40|$|This is a {{case study}} of how Tshwane University of Technology is {{implementing}} quality assurance of its academic programmes in accordance with the requirements of the Higher Education Quality Committee. The focus of the study is on the activities of the central quality unit, the Directorate of Quality Promotion (DQP) regarding the evaluation of its programme evaluations. This is akin to a question raised regarding parliamentary procedures, not long ago when the Auditor General appeared before the parliamentary committee on public accounts. The question was ‘Who is auditing the Auditor General?’ Before this question could be asked at TUT, a strategic decision was taken by the current director of the DQP regarding what the directorate needed to do in achieving leadership in this regard. An introductory description is made of the current curriculum development practices within the new educational dispensation. The statutory roles of the Department of Education, the South African Qualifications Authority&the Higher Education Quality Committee in this process are described. This is followed by an explanation of the new <b>programme</b> <b>outlay</b> within outcomes-based education. In offering a theoretical framework for the study various evaluation models are treated, and the CIPP evaluation model is adopted for this study. The research design for the study is allied to a literature-based model by Brinkerhoff, et. al. This is a six step framework for conducting meta-evaluation. The qualitative data analysis takes the form of evaluating the evaluation against thirty International Evaluation Standards of the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. These standards are sub-divided into the following categories, namely, utility, feasibility, propriety and accuracy standards. The study concludes that conducting a meta-evaluation for programme reviews has the potential to expose strengths and weaknesses of quality assurance practice.
