5|$|On September2, the National Hurricane Center issued gale {{warnings}} and hurricane watches for Guadeloupe, Desirade, Antigua and Barbuda. Later that day, the gale warnings were expanded southward to include islands north of Dominica. After Christine weakened to a tropical depression, the NHC discontinued all watches and warnings for the Leeward Islands. Schools were closed in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands as a precaution. Six scientists {{had to be}} evacuated from the small island of Aves once the storm posed a threat to them. On St. Thomas, nine emergency shelters were opened, mainly in schools. On September5, an emergency meeting was held by disaster officials in Puerto Rico about the threat of flooding from Christine. All residents were urged by government officials to have their disaster kits ready {{and be prepared to}} evacuate if <b>told</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Firefighters, on and off-duty, were advised about the possibility of evacuations and would be pulled into work if needed.|$|E

Mackworth had made clear, as he was <b>told</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> that the main {{consideration}} in handling dissent at Shrewsbury was state security. Fisher and Blake continued to preach against the engagement and their opposition was well known in London, where it was noted by Bulstrode Whitelocke.|$|E

A person who is <b>told</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} by his/her mother for which his father does not like the result is not permitted to tell his/her father that his/her mother said to do that. This is because this could lead to his/her father cursing his/her mother. A child is not permitted to interrupt or contradict a parent, or to disturb a parent's sleep.|$|E

25|$|Set goals: Groups {{that set}} clear, {{challenging}} goals outperform groups whose members have {{lost sight of}} their objectives. The group's goals should be relatively challenging, instead of being too easily accomplished. The advantages of working in a group are often lost when a task is so easy {{that it can be}} accomplished even when members of the group socially loaf. Thus, groups should ensure to set their standards high, but not so high that the goals are unattainable. Latham and Baldes (1975) assessed the practical significance of Locke's theory of goal setting by conducting an experiment with truck drivers who hauled logs from the woods to the mill. When the men were initially <b>told</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> their best when loading the logs, they carried only about 60% of the weight that they could legally haul. When the same drivers were later encouraged to reach a goal of hauling 94% of the legal limit, they increased their efficiency and met this specific goal. Thus, {{the results of this study}} show that performance improved immediately upon the assignment of a specific, challenging goal. Company cost accounting procedures indicated that this same increase in performance without goal setting would have required an expenditure of a quarter of a million dollars on the purchase of additional trucks alone. So this method of goal setting is extremely effective. Other research has found that clear goals can stimulate a number of other performance-enhancing processes, including increases in effort, better planning, more accurate monitoring of the quality of the groups work, and even an increased commitment to the group.|$|E

On June 14, 2006, she made a guest appearance on C-SPAN with Dr. Bob Meaders, the founder of Operation Helmet. That year, {{in an interview with}} Stars and Stripes, she explained her [...] "against the war in Iraq but for the troops" [...] position: [...] "I don't have to be for this war to support the troops because these men and women do what they think is right. They do what they're <b>told</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> They do it with a really good heart. They do the best they can. They don't ask for anything." ...|$|E

500|$|Paul Taylor of the Financial Times {{found the}} ZX81 to be [...] "a {{powerful}} and flexible little computer ideally suited as a fun {{introduction to the}} mysteries of home computing" [...] but cautioned readers about its limitations. It lacked ready-made software, the keyboard {{was not easy to}} use, it did not have sufficiently advanced graphics to be able to replicate arcade-style games and its built-in memory was inadequate. Even so, he suggested, [...] "the ZX81 is a unique British product, part toy, part puzzle, part learning tool and I think that, provided one accepts its limitations and recognises that any computer will only do what it is <b>told</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> it is good value as an introduction to the hobby of home computing." ...|$|E
500|$|The Speaker {{ordered that}} Bellingham be {{transferred}} to the Serjeant-at-Arms's quarters, where MPs [...] who were also magistrates would conduct a committal hearing [...] under the chairmanship of Harvey Christian Combe. The makeshift court heard evidence from eyewitnesses to the crime, and sent messengers to search Bellingham's lodgings. The prisoner kept his composure throughout; although warned against self-incrimination, he insisted on explaining himself: [...] "I have been ill-treated... I have sought redress in vain. I am [...] a most unfortunate man and feel here"—placing hand on heart—"sufficient justification for what I have done." [...] He had, he said, exhausted all proper avenues, and had made it clear to the [...] authorities that he proposed to take independent action. He had been <b>told</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his worst: [...] "I have obeyed them. [...] I have done my worst, and I rejoice in the deed." [...] At around eight o'clock, Bellingham was formally charged with Perceval's murder, and was committed to Newgate Prison to await trial.|$|E
500|$|During {{his initial}} audition, Johnston {{claimed that he}} was bullied and victimised {{from the age of}} six because of his singing. When asked how he dealt with the issue, he stated [...] "I carry on singing." [...] There were claims in the Daily Mail, a UK-based tabloid newspaper, that the programme's {{producers}} had deliberately overstated the extent of Johnston's bullying as a [...] "sob story", suggesting that sympathy rather than his singing got him many of the votes. However, in The Times, Johnston's success story was described as [...] "the stuff of fairytales", as he was successful despite having been raised in [...] "poverty". Johnston said he did not talk about being bullied because he was <b>told</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so by producers, but [...] "because I believed it would help people who were going through what I had gone through be stronger". Johnston has subsequently visited schools and elsewhere to help other victims of bullying. He said [...] "I want to use my experience of bullies to help other kids".|$|E

500|$|White {{was unable}} to {{completely}} halt the slide in circulation, though it rose a little in 1977. [...] That year Cohen lost $15,000 dollars on the magazines, and decided to sell. [...] He spent some time {{looking for a new}} publisher—editor Roy Torgeson was one of those interested—but on September 15, 1978, he sold his half of the business to Arthur Bernhard, his partner. [...] White renewed his suggestions for improving the format of the magazine: he wanted to make Fantastic the same size as Time, and believed he could avoid the mistakes that had been made by other sf magazines that had tried that approach. [...] White also proposed an increase in the budget and asked for a raise. [...] Bernhard not only turned down White's ideas, but also stopped paying him: White responded by resigning. [...] His last official day as editor was November 9; the last issue of Fantastic under his control was the January 1979 issue. [...] He returned all submissions to their authors, saying that he had been <b>told</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so by Bernhard; Bernhard denied this.|$|E
500|$|Mark O'Hare {{directed}} and animated the walk cycles {{in the beginning}} of the episode. The cycle originated when supervising producer at the time Derek Drymon called O'Hare. O'Hare said [...] "Derek would call me out of the blue for freelance, and it was tough to know the context of stuff." [...] He remembered the crew gave him a [...] "bad" [...] synthesizer song and he was <b>told</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> [...] "some kind of weird walk to it." [...] He said [...] "I animated this bizarre SpongeBob walk and turned it in, and that was that." [...] Eventually, Drymon saw the cycle and referred to it as [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] walk. O'Hare had no idea what Drymon was talking about until he learned it was already used in an episode. O'Hare said [...] "so I just figured that it ended up on the cutting room floor, like a lot of stuff you end up doing in animation. I had no idea that he was referring to the actual name of the show [...]" [...] The live action scenes were directed by Mark Osborne (brother of the episode's storyboard director Kent Osborne), and were hosted by Tom Kenny in character as Patchy the Pirate, the president of the fictional SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.|$|E
500|$|Mars {{revealed}} to Billboard in September 2012 on {{a preview of}} his cover story that he recorded an album that represented his freedom. On his debut record, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, the singer reportedly had to change some things because of pressure from his label, something he was displeased with. He clarified that Unorthodox Jukebox was more of him and what he stands for, mainly because he didn't have to modify things. He elaborated, [...] "If I'm changing things around because people might think it's a hard pill to swallow then I'm going {{to feel like a}} circus clown onstage, selling something fake". The variety of music styles presented on Unorthodox Jukebox resulted in his rejection from his label several times in the past; he also confessed that he had to face criticism by label presidents, who—according to him—expressed, [...] "Your music sucks, you don't know who you are, your music is all over the place, and we don't know how to market this stuff. Pick a lane and come back to us". To these statements, the singer added that he felt [...] "disgusted" [...] as he wanted to have the liberty to create his own music and not the music he was <b>told</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E

500|$|In {{his efforts}} {{to carry out his}} orders and {{maintain}} discipline, Stone drew the attention and wrath of his home state's governor, John A. Andrew, and Charles Sumner, the senior U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, both powerful and influential Radical Republican politicians. In late September Stone issued general orders that required his men [...] "not to incite and encourage insubordination among the coloured servants in the neighbourhood." [...] When two runaway slaves came into their lines, one of his regiments, the 20th Massachusetts Infantry, promptly caught them and returned them to their owner. This was done in compliance with Stone's orders as well as both Federal and Maryland law. However, many of the 20th Massachusetts were abolitionists, disagreed with Stone's insistence on returning runaways back into slavery, and wrote both their families and their representatives about the incident. Governor Andrew strongly reprimanded the colonel of the regiment, who gave the letter to Stone. After reading it Stone wrote back, its contents summarized by military historian Bruce Catton as follows: [...] "this regiment was in United States service now and the governor had no business meddling with discipline, the young lieutenant and the colonel had properly done what they were <b>told</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and were not subject to reprimand from any governor, and would the governor in future please keep his hand off?" ...|$|E
