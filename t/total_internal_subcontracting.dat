40|$|A {{requirement}} for rendering realistic images interactively is efficiently simulating material properties. Recent techniques have improved the quality for interactively rendering dielectric materials, but have mostly neglected a phenomenon associated with refraction, namely, <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> reflection.

50|$|One {{classical}} {{example is}} frustrated <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> reflection {{in which the}} evanescent field very close (see graph) {{to the surface of}} a dense medium at which a wave normally undergoes <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> reflection overlaps another dense medium in the vicinity.

40|$|In {{undergraduate}} optics laboratory, {{one thing}} that is not easily achieved is quantitative measurement of optical phase. The reason is that optical phase measurement usually requires expensive interferometers. We demonstrate measurement of relative optical phase shift upon <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> reflection. <b>Total</b> <b>internal</b> reflection, though known by every student of optics, is remembered by 100 % reflection at an interface when angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle, that is, it seems all the same beyond the critical angle. This is not entirely true if one considers the optical phase, which keeps changing upon <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> reflection as the angle of incidence is varied. Furthermore, for linear polarization states perpendicular to or in the plane of incidence (s-and p- polarization), optical phase changes differently upon <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> reflection. Therefore, a linearly polarized beam composed of both s- and p- polarization undergoing <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> reflection becomes elliptically polarized. We show how to determine relative optical phase change between s- and p- polarization states through analysis of the outgoing elliptically polarized beam. Such optical phase change can also be theoretically calculated using Fresnel equations. 1...|$|R
