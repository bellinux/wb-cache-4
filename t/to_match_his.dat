However, Bosh was also known to deliver stern rebukes to teammates who make bad calls on the court. Throughout his career, comparisons have been made between him and Kevin Garnett due to their similar style of play and physique.|$|E

5|$|Pepper saw {{much success}} in playing for Bethlehem; after unimpressive beginnings, {{he went on}} {{to play a major role}} in {{securing}} many titles for the side, including four American Cups, three National Challenge Cups and two National Association Football League triumphs.

Pepper's career became somewhat volatile, signing for four amateur teams within the space of four years; all of which failed <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>his</b> record at Bethlehem. Retirement saw him remain prominent in local sporting and steel-working culture in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, in-time becoming a corn merchant until his death in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the third}} session on Saturday {{with a time of}} 1m41.856s. Hamilton was second quickest, almost three-tenths of a second slower, unable to get a clean lap <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>his</b> teammate. On the slower soft tyres, one lap was impeded by traffic, another was {{disturbed}} by Hamilton spinning after hitting the kerb at turn five. He again failed in his attempt on a very fast lap on the super-soft tyres later in the session, being forced wide after repeating his mistake at turn five. Hamilton was just marginally ahead of Sebastian Vettel, who finished third ahead of Pérez. Daniil Kvyat was unable to set a timed lap as his team worked to solve an electrical problem.|$|E

5|$|A month {{into the}} 2006–07 season, Higgins {{suffered}} a sprained left ankle {{during a game}} against the New Jersey Devils. At the time of the injury, on November 4, 2006, he was leading the Canadiens with eight goals. Sidelined for 6 weeks, Higgins was limited to 61 games, though still managed <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>his</b> previous season's points total with 22 goals and 16 assists. Set to become a restricted free agent in the off-season, Montreal re-signed Higgins to a two-year, US$3.4 million deal on June 25, 2007. Prior {{to the start of the}} 2007–08 season, Higgins was named an alternate captain for the Canadiens. He went on to have a career season with personal bests of 27 goals, 25 assists and 52 points. On November 11, 2008, Higgins recorded his first NHL hat-trick in a 4–0 win over the Ottawa Senators. However, his points total decreased in his fourth NHL campaign with 23 points over 57 games.|$|E
5|$|Ballard {{went on to}} tally 34 {{points during}} his first {{campaign}} with Florida in 2008–09. The following season, on November 30, 2009, Ballard was involved in an on-ice incident that injured his own teammate, goaltender Tomáš Vokoun. After being on the ice for a goal during {{a game against the}} Atlanta Thrashers, Ballard aimed to smash his stick in frustration against the post and mistakenly hit Vokoun in the mask. Vokoun was taken from the ice on a stretcher and suffered a cut on his ear that required stitches; he missed two games before returning to the lineup. Ballard, who apologized to Vokoun following the game, was not disciplined by the Panthers or NHL. He went on <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>his</b> career-high eight goals and added 20 assists for 28 points in his second season with the Panthers. He also ranked third in the league in blocked shots with 201. Ballard had played parts of the season with a hip injury. After completing the campaign, he underwent the second hip surgery of his career in May 2010 to repair a stress fracture and remove a cyst.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 Wimbledon Gentlemen's singles final was the {{championship}} tennis match of the Gentlemen's Singles tournament at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships.

In what was the most historic Major final of the year, Federer sought to win a record shattering seventeenth Major title and a record-tying seventh Wimbledon <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>his</b> idol Pete Sampras.
