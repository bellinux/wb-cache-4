40|$|International audienceCrystalline mercury sulfide {{exists in}} two {{drastically}} different polymorphic forms in different domains of the P,T-diagram: red chain-like insulator alpha-HgS, stable below 344 degrees C, and black tetrahedral narrow-band semiconductor beta-HgS, stable at higher temperatures. Using pulsed neutron and high-energy X-ray diffraction, {{we show that}} these two mercury bonding patterns are present simultaneously in mercury <b>thioarsenate</b> glasses HgS As 2 S 3. The population and interconnectivity of chain-like and tetrahedral dimorphous forms determine both the structural features and fundamental glass properties (thermal, electronic, etc.). DFT simulations of mercury species and RMC modeling of high-resolution diffraction data provide additional details on local Hg environment and connectivity implying the (HgS 2 / 2), oligomeric chains (1 <= m <= 6) are acting as a network former while the HgS 4 / 4 -related mixed agglomerated units behave as a modifier...|$|E
40|$|<b>Thioarsenates</b> {{are common}} arsenic species in sulfidic {{geothermal}} waters, yet {{little is known}} about their biogeochemical traits. In the present study, a novel sulfate-reducing bacterial strain Desulfotomaculum TC- 1 was isolated from a sulfidic hot spring in Tengchong geothermal area, Yunnan Province, China. The arxA gene, encoding anaerobic arsenite oxidase, was successfully amplified from the genome of strain TC- 1, indicating it has a potential ability to oxidize arsenite under anaerobic condition. In anaerobic arsenite oxidation experiments inoculated with strain TC- 1, a small amount of arsenate was detected in the beginning but became undetectable over longer time. <b>Thioarsenates</b> (AsO 4 -xSx 2 - with x = 1 – 4) formed with mono-, di- and tri-thioarsenates being dominant forms. Tetrathioarsenate was only detectable {{at the end of the}} experiment. These results suggest that thermophilic microbes might be involved in the formation of <b>thioarsenates</b> and provide a possible explanation for the widespread distribution of <b>thioarsenates</b> in terrestrial geothermal environments...|$|R

Despite its well-known toxicity, several biogeochemical aspects are so far only rarely investigated and often poorly understood. Concentrations in marine hydrothermal fluids can be greatly enriched compared to seawater with the most important factors being the tectonic setting with its different physicochemical parameters like temperature, controlling phase separation processes, pH affecting As species, mobility and leaching capacity, pressure as a function of depth, the redox conditions and different adsorption and desorption reactions, as well as input of magmatic volatiles.

40|$|Acid-sulfide {{hot springs}} are analogs of early Earth {{geothermal}} systems where microbial metal(loid) resistance likely first evolved. Arsenic is a metalloid enriched in the acid-sulfide hot spring Champagne Pool (Waiotapu, New Zealand). Arsenic speciation in Champagne Pool follows reaction paths {{not yet fully}} understood with respect to biotic contributions and coupling to biogeochemical sulfur cycling. Here we present quantitative arsenic speciation from Champagne Pool, finding arsenite dominant in the pool, rim and outflow channel (55 - 75 % total arsenic), and dithio- and trithioarsenates ubiquitously present as 18 - 25 % total arsenic. In the outflow channel, dimethylmonothioarsenate comprised ≤ 9 % total arsenic, while on the outflow terrace thioarsenates were present at 55 % total arsenic. We also quantified sulfide, thiosulfate, sulfate and elemental sulfur, finding sulfide and sulfate as major species in the pool and outflow terrace, respectively. Elemental sulfur concentration reached a maximum at the terrace. Phylogenetic analysis of 16 S rRNA genes from metagenomic sequencing revealed the dominance of Sulfurihydrogenibium at all sites and an increased archaeal population at the rim and outflow channel. Several phylotypes were found closely related to known sulfur- and sulfide-oxidizers, as well as sulfur- and sulfate-reducers. Bioinformatic analysis revealed genes underpinning sulfur redox transformations, consistent with sulfur speciation data, and illustrating a microbial role in sulfur-dependent transformation of arsenite to <b>thioarsenate.</b> Metagenomic analysis also revealed genes encoding for arsenate reductase at all sites, reflecting the ubiquity of <b>thioarsenate</b> and a need for microbial arsenate resistance despite anoxic conditions. Absence of the arsenite oxidase gene, aio, at all sites suggests prioritization of arsenite detoxification over coupling to energy conservation. Finally, detection of methyl arsenic in the outflow channel, in conjunction with increased sequences from Aquificaceae, supports a role for methyltransferase in thermophilic arsenic resistance. Our study highlights microbial contributions to coupled arsenic and sulfur cycling at Champagne Pool, with implications for understanding the evolution of microbial arsenic resistance in sulfidic geothermal systems.

40|$|The {{objective}} of ASEDMAR {{project is to}} develop a model combining geochemistry, bioavailability and ecotoxicity of arsenic in marine sediments contaminated by human activities. It was previously shown that arsenic in pore waters of marine sediment is mainly present as thioarsenical compounds and classical As forms (As(III), As(V) and methylated forms) remain generally low. Pore water playing {{an important role in the}} transfer of arsenic from sediment to the water column, its characterization in terms of As species is essential to better understand and model the bacterial cycle of arsenic, which is not very well known in marine ecosystem. Thioarsenical compounds determination was performed from solutions collected from sediment microcosms in anaerobic conditions that stimulate activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria with a transformation of sulfate to sulfide leading to a significant increase of dissolved arsenic. Speciation of As was performed by HPLC-ICP-MS according to the method of Wallschläger and Stadey (Anal. Chem. (2007), 79, 3873) allowing the determination of As(III), As(V) and four <b>thioarsenate</b> compounds (AsO 3 S 3 -, AsO 2 S 23 -, AsOS 33 - and AsS 43 -). After sample conditioning under nitrogen, stability of these compounds was studied at different temperature (- 20 °C, immediate freezing with liquid nitrogen followed by a storage at - 20 °C, + 4 °C and room temperature) and at different periods of time (24 hours, 1 week and 2 months) to optimize their analysis in routine conditions. Whatever the temperature, it appears that the time of storage particularly influences the As(III) concentration that decreases with time. The As(V) content remaining stable and the sulfide concentration high, a combination of As(III) with sulfides can be considered because AsO 2 S 23 - and AsS 43 - increase with time. However, it was shown that the most important factor influencing stability is the absence of oxygen and a sample conditioning under nitrogen preserves the samples for a few days, time required for sending samples. This study was part of ASEDMAR project, supported by the french National Research Agency under reference " 2008 CESA- 003 "...|$|E
40|$|Microbial sulfate {{reduction}} {{is an important}} terminal electron accepting process in arsenic-contaminated subsurface environments. Humic acids are ubiquitous in such environments, yet their impact on arsenic mobility under sulfate-reducing conditions is poorly understood. In this study, we {{examined the effects of}} microbial sulfate reduction and humic acid on arsenic mobilization via a series of advective-flow column experiments. The initial solid-phase in these experiments comprised quartz sand that was coated with As(III) -sorbed goethite (α-FeOOH). The effect of humic acid was assessed by comparing columns that received artificial groundwater in which humic acid was either absent or present at 100 mg L− 1, whilst the effect of microbial sulfate reduction was investigated by comparing columns that were inoculated with the sulfate-reducer Desulfovibrio vulgaris (ATCC strain 7757) versus abiotic control columns. The presence of high concentrations of humic acid alone did not enhance the overall extent of arsenic release from either the abiotic or the inoculated (sulfate reducing) columns. This is consistent with similar arsenic concentrations in porewaters filtered to both 3 ̆c 0. 45 μm and 3 ̆c 3 kDa, demonstrating that aqueous arsenic did not form mobile colloidal humic acid complexes. In contrast, microbial sulfate reduction was found to mobilize substantial levels of arsenic relative to those observed in the corresponding abiotic control columns. Iron and sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) showed that reaction between goethite and microbially-produced sulfide lead to accumulation of mackinawite (FeS) and elemental S. Microbial sulfate reduction also caused important changes in arsenic speciation, especially the formation of aqueous dithioarsenate and monothioarsenate. However, arsenic K-edge XAS showed that arsenic sulfide mineral phases (orpiment and realgar) did not form during the 60 day advective-flow experiment. The formation of poorly-sorbing <b>thioarsenate</b> species appeared to contribute to the observed enhancement of arsenic mobilization from the inoculated columns. Dithioarsenate and monothioarsenate were relatively stable, and were found to make up 3 ̆e 40...|$|E
