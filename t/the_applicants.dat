5|$|A melancholic Darryl finally assembles {{a conference}} room meeting with several {{potential}} new hires, but utters several discouraging remarks about the job and exits, leaving Andy alone {{to take charge of}} the process. Andy does not know what he is doing and all of <b>the</b> <b>applicants</b> walk out. Darryl blames himself for the failure and demands that Andy fire him, leaving Andy baffled and with no choice but to handle the hiring of new warehouse staff himself.|$|E
5|$|Each Poor Law Union {{employed}} {{one or more}} relieving officers, {{whose job}} it was to visit those applying for assistance and assess what relief, if any, they should be given. Any applicants considered to be in need of immediate assistance could be issued with a note admitting them directly to the workhouse. Alternatively they might be offered any necessary money or goods to tide them over until the next meeting of the guardians, who would decide on the appropriate level of support {{and whether or not}} <b>the</b> <b>applicants</b> should be assigned to the workhouse.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to taking the written exam, all of <b>the</b> <b>applicants</b> {{had to take}} a horse-riding test as well. Having grown up riding horses on his family's plantation, Middleton scored very well on this exam, and the officer in charge thought that he would want to go into the cavalry. Middleton, however, wanted to go into the infantry, leaving the officer stunned that anyone with such horsemanship skills would even consider spending his time walking instead of riding a fine horse.|$|E

5|$|The host {{city for}} an Olympic Games is usually chosen {{seven to eight}} years ahead of their celebration. The process of {{selection}} is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The prospective host city applies to its country's National Olympic Committee; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can {{be presented to the}} International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities asked to complete a questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organisation of the Olympic Games. In this form, <b>the</b> <b>applicants</b> must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee. The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialised group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. On the basis of this technical evaluation, the IOC Executive Board selects <b>the</b> <b>applicants</b> that will proceed to the candidature stage.|$|E

50|$|Interview phase:The {{interview}} phase {{entails the}} actual {{conduct of the}} interview, {{the interaction between the}} interviewer and <b>the</b> <b>applicant.</b> Initial interviewer impressions about <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> before <b>the</b> interview may influence the amount of time an interviewer spends in the interview with <b>the</b> <b>applicant,</b> <b>the</b> interviewer’s behavior and questioning of <b>the</b> <b>applicant,</b> and <b>the</b> interviewer’s postinterview evaluations. Preinterview impressions also can affect what the interviewer notices about the interviewee, recalls from the interview, and how an interviewer interprets what <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> says and does in the interview.|$|R
5|$|While serving under Pershing, Dodd gained {{experience}} and {{was appointed to}} a staff position as the Aviation Officer within the American Expeditionary Force (AEF), when it was raised for overseas service during World War I. Before sailing to France, on 27 May 1917, Dodd sent his assistant, Lt. Birdseye B. Lewis, to New York with instructions to round-up qualified candidates for the aviation staff. Among <b>the</b> <b>applicants</b> was auto race car driver, Edward V. Rickenbacker, who was promptly enlisted as a sergeant first class, chauffeur. Upon his arrival in Europe in late 1917, Dodd was appointed lieutenant colonel in the Signal Corps.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, he {{remained}} at his alma mater, Minnesota, for one season {{as an assistant}} coach in 1914. Tulane University selected Shaughnessy as head football coach in 1915 over potential candidates Dana X. Bible and Charley Moran, among others. Notre Dame assistant coach Knute Rockne and Ray Morrison were both unable to travel to New Orleans for an interview, and Tulane officials required a face-to-face meeting with <b>the</b> <b>applicants.</b> The school offered Shaughnessy $1,875 ($ adjusted for inflation) to be its football, basketball, and track coach, and athletic director. When he arrived, he found the football field in a state of disrepair and the equipment to be woefully inadequate. Because the athletic department was in dire financial straits, Shaughnessy paid to purchase new equipment for the team. With only one opponent scheduled in the upcoming season, he wrote letters to sixty schools to secure additional games.|$|E
5|$|Applications {{for federal}} aid {{continued}} through June, with state approvals reaching $54 million on June 3. By this date, the Army Corps of Engineers reported that 964,170 cubic yards (737,160 cubic meters), roughly 58%, of the 1.65 million cubic yards (1.26 million cubic meters) of debris had been removed. Assistance for {{farmers and ranchers}} who suffered severe losses from the tornadoes was also available by June 3. After {{more than a month}} of being open, emergency shelters were set to be closed on June 18. On June 21, an educational road show made by FEMA visited the hardest hit areas in Oklahoma to urge residents to build storm cellars. According to FEMA, more than 9,500 residents applied for federal aid during the allocated period {{in the wake of the}} tornadoes. Most of <b>the</b> <b>applicants</b> lived in Oklahoma and Cleveland counties, 3,800 and 3,757 persons respectively. In all, disaster recovery aid for the tornadoes amounted to roughly $67.8 million by the end of July 2.|$|E
50|$|Applicants must {{likewise}} take {{an entrance}} examination where <b>the</b> <b>applicant's</b> analytic and writing skills are tested. If <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> passes <b>the</b> examination, <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> must also undergo a panel interview where {{his or her}} ability to reason verbally is tested. Only after passing both the examination and panel interview can <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> be qualified to enroll.|$|R
50|$|Once the {{examiner}} is satisfied that <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> has met {{all of the}} minimum requirements to be a pilot, they will direct <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> {{to return to the}} home field, and then they will issue <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> a Temporary Airman's Certificate. <b>The</b> <b>applicant</b> may then enjoy all the privileges of the private pilot airplane, single engine land certificate.|$|R
50|$|If {{the officer}} issues a {{favorable}} determination of credible fear, then <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> goes through regular removal proceedings. Specifically, the officer issues a Notice To Appear (NTA) to <b>the</b> <b>applicant,</b> directing <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> to appear {{for his or}} her removal case in an immigration court, during which <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> needs {{to make the case for}} asylum in full detail to the immigration judge. <b>The</b> <b>applicant</b> is now handled by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). After ICE files the NTA with the court, a removal hearing is held before an immigration judge. <b>The</b> <b>applicant</b> may have to wait for several months for a hearing due to the huge backlog of cases.|$|R
5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by <b>the</b> <b>applicants,</b> the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} after the {{announcement}} that applications were being sought for the second group of NASA astronauts, Armstrong {{became more and more}} excited about the prospects of both the Apollo program and of investigating a new aeronautical environment. Armstrong's astronaut application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline. Dick Day, with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed. At Brooks Air Force Base at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of <b>the</b> <b>applicants</b> described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.|$|E
5|$|The {{minister}} {{charged with}} responsibility for the Act is required to publish in the Government Gazette a list stating the Government departments which are authorized departments {{for the purposes of}} the Act, and the names and addresses for service of the solicitors for the departments. As of 7 December 2005, no such list had been published. For this reason, in Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2005), decided on that date, the High Court held that instead of instituting the action against the Minister for Home Affairs and the Commissioner of Police, <b>the</b> <b>applicants</b> should have done so against the Attorney-General. Nonetheless, the suit should not be dismissed as this was a procedural irregularity that could be cured by substituting the Attorney-General as the respondent.|$|E

However, if <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> does not have a local connection with the district of the authority then they may be referred to another local authority with which they have a local connection (unless it is likely that <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> would suffer violence or threats of violence in that other area).|$|R

5|$|In early August as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter was beginning, the Eighth United States Army ordered Lieutenant Colonel John H. McGee, {{the head}} of its G-3 Operations Miscellaneous Division, to seek volunteers for a new {{experimental}} Army Ranger unit. McGee was given only seven weeks to organize and train the unit before it was sent into combat, as commanders felt the need for Rangers was dire, and that existing soldiers could be trained as Rangers {{in a relatively short}} period of time. Because of this limitation, volunteers were solicited only from existing Eighth Army combat units in Korea, though subsequent Ranger companies were able to recruit Ranger veterans from World War II. From the Eighth Army replacement pool, McGee recruited Second Lieutenant Ralph Puckett, newly commissioned from West Point and with no combat experience, to serve as the company commander. Second Lieutenants Charles Bunn and Barnard Cummings, Jr., became Puckett's two platoon leaders. Several hundred enlisted men volunteered from the Eighth Army, though few had combat experience. Through a quick and informal selection process, Puckett picked the men to fill out the company based on weapons qualifications, athleticism, and duty performance. There was no time to administer physical fitness tests for <b>the</b> <b>applicants,</b> and unmarried men younger than 26 were preferred. Recruits were told they would receive no hazard pay.|$|E
