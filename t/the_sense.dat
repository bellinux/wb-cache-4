30|$|In this section, {{we first}} review the {{definition}} of traditional detection probability and present its limitations. Then, the concept and definition of our TDP is presented.

We assume that <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> duration is relatively short compared to <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> interval and <b>the</b> mean busy and idle periods of primary users are relatively long compared to <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> interval.

30|$|The {{increase}} {{of the number of}} cooperative SUs leads to a high space diversity gain and helps to improve <b>the</b> spectrum <b>sensing</b> performance.

40|$|The {{performance}} of cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio (CR) networks depends on <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> mode, <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> time and <b>the</b> number of cooperative users.
