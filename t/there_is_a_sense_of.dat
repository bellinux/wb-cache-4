However, there have been situations in the past in which this delicate social fabric has broken down. Today the city {{is considered to be a}} great example of communal equality.|$|E
25|$|Klingons see {{something}} that isn't growing as something that is dying. A Klingon fights not for sport but to gain an advantage for the Empire, for his family and for himself. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> paranoia, as others are constantly watching all one's activities in order to seek advancement. This leads to a morality that Federation races see as often cruel and remorseless.|$|E
25|$|Croatian, Portuguese and Italian fishing families, {{many of them}} Catholic, founded San Pedro. Content {{with the}} beauty of the hills rising from the harbor, they built their homes, their church, their {{businesses}} and dutifully produced large families to do the same. More than 100 years later, some of their children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren live in those family homes, work still on the docks or in town and worship still at Mary Star of the Sea. The town's population has remained steady for the last two decades, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> continuity that is palpable in this town, an intimacy--among the people, and between the people and the place.|$|E

25|$|Lyrical {{abstraction}} shares similarities {{with color}} field painting and abstract expressionism {{especially in the}} freewheeling usage of paint — texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in abstract expressionism and color field painting. However the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from abstract expressionism and action painting of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in action painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in lyrical abstraction <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.|$|E
25|$|The pair were {{nominated}} for the Turner Prize in 1999, cited for their exhibition, Gamma at the Lisson Gallery in London. On the run up to the Turner Prize winner announcement, they also had a solo exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London (1999). Art works that were exhibited included Stasi City, Parliament (A Third House), and Gamma, a multiscreen video installation that was filmed at the former US military base at Greenham Common in Berkshire. This site was used to house nuclear cruise missiles during the Cold War and decommissioned in 1992. The Wilsons' video moves through the deserted institution, where nothing is now happening, evoking disturbing memories and possibilities. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> unease and threat, implied but never realised. They are the only characters in the film, appearing in military-style skirts and polished black shoes.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{of irony}} to CBS' {{coverage}} of the assassination. On September 2, 1963, Kennedy gave an interview with Cronkite, helping CBS inaugurate network television's first half hour evening newscast.|$|R

500|$|Degrassi: The Next Generation has {{received}} generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly has called it [...] "a cult hit", and The New York Times named it [...] "Tha Best Teen TV N da WRLD (The best teen TV in the world)". Of the first season, The Ottawa Citizens Tony Atherton had mixed {{feelings of the}} new incarnation, saying it [...] "has a cleaner, more polished look, has lost its edge [...] nothing new to viewers familiar with the groundbreaking preceding series, nor to anyone else who has watched the deluge of teen dramas since... <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> déjà vu {{with regards to the}} plots and characters". He did, however, praise the show for having [...] "the same simple narrative told from a kid's viewpoint, and the same regard for unvarnished reality [...] ".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} {{about the development}} of Super Mario Sunshine with producer Takashi Tezuka and directors Yoshiaki Koizumi and Kenta Usui, it was mentioned that the game's development began with the idea of gameplay involving a water pump. However, at first the developers thought that the world was too daringly out of character with Mario. Therefore, they tried using a man-type character, but thought this was too odd and that [...] "if there was a man next to Mario, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> incongruity." [...] There were ten candidates for possible water nozzles, and FLUDD was chosen because of fitting in the game's setting, despite it not being one of the favorites. They also stated that several Yoshi features were omitted, such as Yoshi vomiting water fed to him.|$|E

60|$|Violet blushed excessively, {{and made}} some inarticulate disavowals. She felt it {{presumption}} to let her name be coupled with Miss Martindale's, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of something dangerous and wrong in expecting admiration.|$|R
500|$|Tony Atherton of the Ottawa Citizen {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} of the new incarnation, saying it [...] "has a cleaner, more polished look, has lost its edge [...] nothing new to viewers familiar with the groundbreaking preceding series, nor to anyone else who has watched the deluge of teen dramas since", adding that because there is [...] "little ground left to break in teen drama <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> déjà vu {{with regards to the}} plots and characters". He did, however, praise the show for having [...] "the same simple narrative told from a kid's viewpoint, and the same regard for unvarnished reality [...] It is light years from far-fetched high-school melodramas like Boston Public and Dawson's Creek ... is every bit as good as its beloved predecessor. In fact, in some respects it is even better".|$|E
500|$|The Spectator {{was more}} equivocal in its {{appraisal}} of She. The review described the narrative as [...] "very stirring" [...] and [...] "exciting" [...] and of [...] "remarkable imaginative power", adding: [...] "The ingenuity of the story... is as subtle as ever romancer invented, {{and from the}} day when Leo and Holly land {{on the coast of}} Africa, to the day when the Pillar of Fire is revealed to them by the all but immortal 'She-who-must-be-obeyed', the interest of the tale rises higher and higher with every new turn in its course". However, the review took issue with the characterisation of She and the manner of her demise: [...] "To the present writer <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the ludicrous in the end of She that spoiled, instead of concluding with imaginative fitness, the thread of the impossible worked into the substance of this vivid and brilliantly told story". Haggard was moved to respond to the criticism of Ayesha's death, writing that [...] "in the insolence of her strength and loveliness, she lifts herself up against the Omnipotent. Therefore, at the appointed time she is swept away by It... Vengeance, more heavy because more long delayed, strikes her in her proudest part – her beauty".|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics were}} less {{enthusiastic}} about the season, though. The Seattle Times Melanie McFarland was unsure whether the series' success in Canada would follow when it began airing in the US. [...] "As popular as Degrassi was, {{it was still a}} mere cult hit in the United States; the crowd that had access to it initially on PBS {{might not be able to}} tune into [...] Soft-pedaling through the issues might work for today's family of viewers, but what's gentle enough for Mom and Dad's peace of mind might not be enough to hook Junior or the original Degrassi's older fans". She was, however, [...] "happy [...] chose Degrassi students to navigate teen perils instead of digging up Screech and the gang for another nauseating go-round". Tony Atherton of the Ottawa Citizen had mixed feelings of the new incarnation, saying it [...] "has a cleaner, more polished look, has lost its edge [...] nothing new to viewers familiar with the groundbreaking preceding series, nor to anyone else who has watched the deluge of teen dramas since", adding that because there is [...] "little ground left to break in teen drama <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> déjà vu with regards to the plots and characters". He did, however, praise the show for having [...] "the same simple narrative told from a kid's viewpoint, and the same regard for unvarnished reality [...] light years from far-fetched high-school melodramas like Boston Public and Dawson's Creek [...] is every bit as good as its beloved predecessor. In fact, in some respects it is even better". After watching nearly seventy hours of twenty-one Canadian-produced programs, the Simon Fraser University cited Degrassi: The Next Generation in their report as one of the Canadian television programmes that is [...] "too Caucasian".|$|E
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{of mission}} and {{excitement}} at the Mint, {{and it was}} the same thing here at the Institute. We were banded together by a common purpose—and by the sheer terror of it all.|$|R
6000|$|These remarks {{checked her}} intention. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of {{weakness}} in following them {{by saying that}} she had just met her husband by appointment. [...] "Then you would advise me not to communicate with him?" [...] she observed.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of motion, <b>a</b> {{very slight}} jar, and Robert, without moving from his seat, was {{conscious}} {{that the room}} had vanished, and that a large arched oaken door stood in the place which it had occupied.|$|R
2500|$|After {{traveling}} from England in 2009 {{to attend the}} festival {{for the third consecutive}} year, Jela Webb wrote: [...] "Like many others before me, having experienced it once, it took hold of my soul and I just want to keep returning year after year.

2500|$|This policy {{meant that}} Singapore could quickly {{mobilise}} enough defence forces to deter any invasion, especially against Indonesia during the Confrontation, when the British withdrew in September 1971. [...] Females were {{left out of}} national service — the explanation being that, {{during a time of}} war, they would be required to support the economy while the men were fighting. This policy is sometimes questioned as being sexist and has been discussed in the mass media a number of times together with the length of training involved. The creation of the national service policy is thought to aid the strengthening of national and racial ties since <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> unity when training as a youth with peers of other races.|$|E
2500|$|In his absence, the Ponzi scheme unravelled. On 17 April, around 600 {{collection}} agents {{claiming to}} be associated with Saradha Group assembled at the headquarters of TMC and demanded government intervention. Despondency quickly spread across Bengal. A Times of India interviewee said, [...] "'The entire Dakshin Barasat today looks like it was hit by a cyclone. Every home has a bankrupt depositor or a fugitive agent. People who were once friends became enemies. Happy households became miserable. Students stopped going to school. Traders lost interest in opening shutters. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> treachery that has replaced the warmth of a neighbourhood. Suddenly everything has become vicious." [...] By this time, the Saradha Group financial scandal had colloquially become known as [...] "Bonzi"a portmanteau of the words Ponzi and Bengal.|$|E

2500|$|The UN {{described}} {{the situation as}} a [...] "critical protection crisis". The entire civilian population in the Gaza strip remains vulnerable, the UN reported, with no safe haven, no bomb shelters and with closed borders, {{making it one of}} the rare conflicts where civilians have no place to flee. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> [...] "panic, fear and distress" [...] throughout the whole strip. Civilians have implemented a self-imposed curfew since no public warning systems or effective shelters exist. People have been evacuating their homes and staying in streets for long hours exposed to further danger, or staying with relatives. Civilians face insecurities while re-stocking basic food items, water and cooking gas. Children, 56% of the population, have no outlets and they remain [...] "dangerously exposed" [...] to the fighting around them.|$|E
2500|$|Milton first {{presents}} Adam and Eve in Book IV with impartiality. The {{relationship between}} Adam and Eve {{is one of}} [...] "mutual dependence, not a relation of domination or hierarchy." [...] While the author does place Adam above Eve in regard to his intellectual knowledge, and in turn his relation to God, he also grants Eve the benefit of knowledge through experience. Hermine Van Nuis clarifies that although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> stringency associated with the specified roles of the male and the female, each unreservedly accepts the designated role because it is viewed as an asset. Instead of believing that these roles are forced upon them, each uses the obligatory requirement as a strength in their relationship with each other. These minor discrepancies {{could be interpreted as}} an indication of the author's view on the importance of mutuality between a husband and a wife.|$|E
2500|$|Eudora Welty {{suggests}} that Eggleston sees {{the complexity and}} beauty of the mundane world: [...] "The extraordinary, compelling, honest, beautiful and unsparing photographs all {{have to do with}} the quality of our lives in the ongoing world: they succeed in showing us the grain of the present, like the cross-section of a tree.... They focus on the mundane world. But no subject is fuller of implications than the mundane world!" [...] Mark Holborn, in his introduction to Ancient and Modern writes about the dark undercurrent of these mundane scenes as viewed through Eggleston's lens: [...] " [...] subjects are, on the surface, the ordinary inhabitants and environs of suburban Memphis and Mississippi—friends, family, barbecues, back yards, a tricycle and the clutter of the mundane. The normality of these subjects is deceptive, for behind the images <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> lurking danger." [...] American artist Edward Ruscha said of Eggleston's work, [...] "When you see a picture he’s taken, you’re stepping into some kind of jagged world that seems like Eggleston World.” ...|$|E
60|$|He {{answered}} dreamily, and sluggishly, reluctantly, as if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of repose in him {{which he}} disliked to break by putting {{any of his}} sensations into words.

60|$|It was {{not quite}} so dark; and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> as of open country {{stretching}} out {{to the limits of}} the horizon. Overhead a vague greyish light suffused the sky, and the wind swept the clouds in great rolling banks right across that light.|$|R
