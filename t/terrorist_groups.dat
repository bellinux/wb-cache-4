5|$|Australia's {{changing}} security {{environment will}} lead to new demands being placed on the Australian Defence Force. Although it is not expected that Australia will face any threat of direct attack from another country, <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> and tensions between nations in East Asia pose threats to Australian security. More broadly, the Australian Government believes {{that it needs to}} make a contribution to maintaining the rules based order globally. There is also a risk that climate change, weak economic growth and social factors could cause instability in South Pacific countries.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Russian {{government}} announced {{that all of}} its remaining smallpox samples would be moved to the Vector Institute in Koltsovo. With {{the breakup of the}} Soviet Union and unemployment of many of the weapons program's scientists, U.S. government officials have expressed concern that smallpox and the expertise to weaponize it may have become available to other governments or <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> who might wish to use virus as means of biological warfare. Specific allegations made against Iraq in this respect, however, proved to be mistaken.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis {{focuses on the}} nexus between a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group's</b> narrative and the group's success or failure in achieving its strategic goals. This work theorizes that the interaction of competing narratives exerts a systematic impact {{on the ability of}} the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> to achieve its strategic goals through the influence that the narratives have over a group's members, the group's adversary, and the affected population. Although a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> with a good narrative can be defeated, a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> with a weak narrative is much less likely to win. Consequently, in order for a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> to improve its chances of prevailing, it needs a strong narrative. While issues like material shortfalls, the repressiveness of state security services, and changing demographics could contribute to the demise of a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group,</b> these factors also serve to demonstrate how difficult it is for a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> with a weak narrative to generate enough support to overcome these deficits. Since narratives are not fixed, each side may choose to change their narrative in order to accurately address changing circumstances. Changes could follow shifts in policy, appointment of new leadership, and even changes of fortune. US Army (USA) authors...|$|R
50|$|Six Filipinos, Lin Mad Salleh, Holland Kalbi, Habil Suhaili, Timhar Hadir, Aiman Radie and a Malaysian man, Abdul Hadi Mawan {{were accused}} of being members of a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group,</b> which is {{punishable}} with 20 years to life imprisonment and a fine, or both, if found guilty. The sole Filipina Norhaida Ibnahi was also ordered to enter her defence for allegedly willfully harbouring individuals she knew {{to be members of}} a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group.</b> A local man, Mohamad Ali Ahmad, and a Filipino Basil Samiul were acquitted of waging war and being members of a <b>terrorists</b> <b>group,</b> but were later charged with soliciting or giving support to a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group,</b> to which they pleaded not guilt. The new charge was made after Justice Chung found the prosecution had shown evidence that they had solicited or given support to a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group,</b> an offence punishable with life imprisonment or a fine. Another Malaysian named Pabblo Alie was charged with soliciting support for a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group,</b> an offence punishable with up to 30 years imprisonment and a fine if found guilty.|$|R

The two join the FBI task force investigating the bombing, led by special agents Pierson (Sam Anderson) and Takahashi (Hiro Kanagawa). Watts and Black quickly dismiss several false claims of responsibility by <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups.</b> Black listens to the 911 call left by Dees, deducing that the numbers dialled spell the word kaboom on a telephone keypad.|$|E
5|$|Mansoor Ijaz was {{involved}} in unofficial negotiations between the U.S. and Sudanese governments in 1996 and 1997 to obtain access to Sudan's intelligence files on Osama bin Laden and the early remnants of Al-Qaeda's network there after efforts to extradite bin Laden to the U.S. failed in early 1996. In the same year, the United States Congress imposed sanctions against Khartoum over allegations of harboring and abetting terrorist cells on its soil. In early 1996, CIA and State Department officials held secret meetings near Washington D.C. with Sudan's then-defense minister, El Fatih Erwa. In May 1996, bin Laden left Sudan for Afghanistan {{under pressure from the}} United States when the meetings failed to reconcile U.S. demands made of Khartoum about its record in aiding, abetting and harboring known <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> and individuals.|$|E
5|$|An SASR troop was {{deployed}} to Timor Leste in May 2006 {{as part of}} Operation Astute, operating alongside a Commando Company Group {{as part of the}} Special Forces Component following renewed unrest there. On 4 March 2007, along with the commandos, SASR personnel took part in the Battle of Same during which five rebels were killed during an unsuccessful attempt to apprehend the rebel leader, Alfredo Reinado. It was reported in October 2006 that 20 SASR operators were in the southern Philippines, supporting Filipino operations against the Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiah <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups,</b> but this was denied by the Department of Defence. Meanwhile, following tensions in Fiji between the military and the government the Australian Government dispatched three naval vessels in November and December 2006 as part of Operation Quickstep, in preparation for a potential evacuation of Australian citizens. On 29 November 2006, a Black Hawk helicopter from the 171st Aviation Squadron carrying four crew and six soldiers from the SASR crashed while attempting to land on HMAS Kanimbla and sank in international waters off Fiji. The helicopter's pilot and a soldier from SASR were killed in the crash.|$|E

40|$|Terrorism, {{like other}} forms of {{political}} violence, has an organizational context. Few studies, however, have considered the influence of organizational life upon the outward behavior of the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group.</b> This thesis explores the possibility that terrorism, {{in addition to its}} political context, reflects the internal dynamics of the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group.</b> Assuming that action is what binds the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> together, the use of violence may oftentimes be dictated more by the need to satisfy the internal goal of group survival than to directly further the group's external political agenda. Focusing upon internal cohesion as the critical mediating variable for group survival, this paper examines how the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group's</b> efforts to maintain itself drives violent behavior that transcends political considerations and operational prudence. When external and internal requirements become contradictory, the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> faces a dilemma. Caught in a vicious cycle of reacting to strategic failure with more violent action in order to maintain itself, the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> generates a negative dynamic of violence that not only undermines its chances of achieving stated long-term goals but also accelerates its decline.

5|$|The {{decision}} came at {{a delicate}} time for relations between Iran and Western nations, which were removing sanctions on Iran after its compliance with an agreement for curtailing development of its nuclear enrichment program. The agreement stipulated that once Iranian compliance with {{the terms of the}} agreement was verified, most sanctions against Iran would be lifted, including all sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council as well as nuclear-related European Union and U.S. sanctions; U.S. sanctions against Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles would not be affected. In mid-January 2016, most sanctions were lifted. In March, the District Court for the Southern District of New York found, by default, that Iran had provided support to certain <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> and individuals responsible for the September 11 attacks and awarded $10.5billion in damages to the plaintiffs, which consisted of $3billion to reimburse insurance companies for paid claims and $7.5billion for victims and their families ($2million for pain and suffering and $6.88million in punitive damages per victim). The same judge ruled just six months earlier that there was insufficient evidence linking Saudi Arabia—which has sour relations with Iran—to the 9/11 attacks to overcome, under the terrorism exemption, Saudi Arabia's immunity under the FSIA.|$|E
