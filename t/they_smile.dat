500|$|Landis {{had been}} a lawyer with a {{corporate}} practice; upon his elevation to the bench, corporate litigants expected him to favor them. According to a 1907 magazine article about Landis, [...] "Corporations smiled pleasantly {{at the thought of}} a corporation lawyer being on the bench. <b>They</b> <b>smile</b> no more." [...] In an early case, Landis fined the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company the maximum $4,000 for illegally importing workers, even though Winifred Landis's sister's husband served on the corporate board. In another decision, Landis struck down a challenge to the Interstate Commerce Commission's (ICC) jurisdiction over rebating, a practice banned by the Elkins Act of 1903 in which railroads and favored customers agreed that the customers would pay less than the posted tariff, which by law was to be the same for all shippers. Landis's decision allowed the ICC to take action against railroads which gave rebates.|$|E
500|$|The video's {{opening scene}} shows the sun rising and Rihanna waking up. Meanwhile, Ne-Yo walks along a street, {{wearing a hat}} that obscures most of his face. Rihanna is in her room; she is bored and {{wondering}} which clothes to wear, and she finds a gold necklace. As the song starts, Rihanna lies in bed and sings, while Ne-Yo continues walking along the street, approaches the hotel and cautiously looks around before entering it. Meanwhile, Rihanna dresses, leaves the room and walks through the hallway of the hotel. Ne-Yo goes in an elevator {{to the floor of}} Rihanna's room. As Rihanna waits near the elevator, it opens. Ne-Yo and Rihanna meet and smile at each other as Rihanna enters the elevator and Ne-Yo exits. It is then revealed that Rihanna and Ne-Yo are not singing about each other, but different people. As the video progresses, Rihanna is downstairs, chanting the lyrics of the song and Ne-Yo is in a hallway. He knocks on a door, which his girlfriend opens, and he enters the room. Rihanna simultaneously climbs into her lover's car and <b>they</b> <b>smile</b> at each other. The video ends with the previous scenes showing Rihanna leaving her hotel room.
