5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) later {{encounters}} {{the stranger}} {{as she walks}} into an elevator. Both ride in silence up to the fourth floor, with Scully somewhat unsettled by the experience. At Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) apartment, Mulder and Scully begin discussing a case the pair are working on, wherein {{the heart of the}} victim had been removed with the absence of any significant physical evidence. Mulder believes the heart was removed with a technique known as psychic surgery. Meanwhile, Padgett, who is Mulder's neighbor, stands on a chair with his ear to an air vent, listening <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{telephones}} Scully {{and tries}} to explain that he's the real Mulder. Scully does not believe him and asks Fletcher—in Mulder's body—to pick up and listen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b> Fletcher decides they should immediately report this incident, which further confuses Scully. She goes to Mulder’s apartment (where Fletcher is having a tryst with Kersh's assistant) and tells Fletcher that they traced the telephone call to a pay phone near Area 51 and she suspects it is Mulder's informant. Fletcher is indifferent to this news and Scully yells at him, sensing that his behavior is very strange and his lack {{of concern for the}} X-Files is completely out of character. Scully decides to investigate, and drives through the desert towards Area 51. She stops at a burned out gas station and finds a penny and a dime merged. Later, when Scully arrives at Fletcher's house, Mulder tries desperately to convince Scully that he is really Mulder. Scully remains skeptical and thinks that any information Mulder describes could be obtained in other ways. Mulder tells Scully that he will bring proof of the defect of the UFO and the resultant problems that night, but Fletcher, having eavesdropped on the conversation, calls his old office posing as Mulder to inform them of the source of the leak—Mulder posing as Fletcher. Military police arrive at the appointed hour, and Mulder is dragged away, kicking and screaming, desperately trying to convince Scully. Mulder asks if he would turn in an informant to the authorities in this manner as he is carried away, and Scully begins to realize that Mulder may be telling the truth.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{exploring}} {{the use of}} closing utterances in conversation in one of Indonesian television program. The results show {{that there are three}} types of strategies implemented close conversation and all of it is the part of positive face-saving strategies. These three strategies are: positive comment, excuse (reason), and <b>the</b> imperative <b>to</b> end strategy (imperative <b>to</b> end <b>the</b> <b>conversation).</b> Positive comments applied if the speakers actually enjoy <b>the</b> <b>conversation,</b> but he or she had to end it for some reasons. Excuse strategy is used <b>to</b> close <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> by providing an alternative motivation or alternative explanations for the hearer which potentially exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> threat of the face. Lastly, imperative <b>to</b> end <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> strategy applied by the use of imperative words/sentences <b>to</b> close <b>the</b> <b>conversation,</b> but <b>the</b> speaker still trying to save his/her partner’s face. In general, the positive face-saving strategies used by speakers <b>to</b> close <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> also consider <b>the</b> feelings of the hearer, giving positive comments or express a reason why a conversation should end...|$|R

25|$|Malagasy has {{a complex}} system of deixis (these, those, here, there, etc.), with seven degrees of {{distance}} {{as well as}} evidentiality across all seven. The evidential dimension is prototypically visible vs. non-visible referents; however, the non-visible forms {{may be used for}} visible referents which are only vaguely identified or have unclear boundaries, whereas the visible forms are used for non-visible referents when these are topical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{cocktail}} party effect is the phenomenon {{that a person}} hears his or her name even when not attending <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b> To study this, a screening measure for attentional control was given that tested a person’s ability {{to keep track of}} words while also doing math problems. Participants were separated into two groups---low and high span attentional control ability groups. They listened to two word lists read simultaneously by a male and a female voice and were told to ignore the male voice. Their name was read by the “ignored” male voice. Low span people were more likely to hear their name compared to high span people. This result suggests that people with lower attentional control ability have more trouble inhibiting information from the surrounding environment.|$|E
25|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that fathers generally tend to avoid sexual conversations with their children. Many fathers have uncertainties on how to start <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b> Other times they simply put the initiative on their daughters to come to them with questions or issues. Even when the conversation is launched fathers tend to be judgmental or only talk about abstinence. Fathers {{are more likely to}} forbid daughters from having sex when they are talking. Wilson et al. (2010) found that some fathers felt that talking about the potential consequences of sex was easier than talking about sex itself. Fathers overall tend to apply more orders when talking to their daughters than giving them unbiased information or simply listening and trying to give them their best advice.|$|E

25|$|For Grayling, work on {{technical}} problems {{is only one}} aspect of philosophy. Another aspect, one which has been at the centre of philosophy's place in history, has more immediate application to daily life: the questions of ethics, which revolve upon what Grayling calls the great Socratic question, 'How should one live?'. In pursuit of what he describes as 'contributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> society has with itself about possibilities for good lives in good societies.' Grayling writes widely on contemporary issues, including war crimes, the legalisation of drugs, euthanasia, secularism, and human rights. He has articulated positions on humanist ethics and on the history and nature of concepts of liberty as applied in civic life. In support of his belief that the philosopher should engage in public debate, he brings these philosophical perspectives to issues of the day in his work as a writer and as a commentator on radio and television.|$|E
25|$|The poem {{is similar}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> poems created by Coleridge, {{including}} Dejection: An Ode. The poems were not real conversations {{as there is}} no response to the narrator of the poem, but they are written as if there would be a response. The poems seek to have a response, though it never comes, and the possibility of such a voice though absence is a type of prosopopoeia. In general, Coleridge's poems discuss the cosmic as they long for a response, and it is this aspect, not a possible object of the conversation, that forms the power of the poem. Wordsworth took up the form in both Tintern Abbey and Ode: Intimations of Immortality, but he lacks the generous treatment of the narrator as found in Coleridge's poems. As a whole, Wordsworth's technique is impersonal and more logical, and the narrator is placed in the same position as the object of the conversation. The narrator of Wordsworth is more self-interested and any object beyond the narrator is kept without a possible voice and is turned into a second self of the poet. As such, the conversation has one of the participants lose his identity {{for the sake of the}} other and that individual represents loss and mortality.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} {{nature and}} [...] "free-form" [...] gameplay encourage creating personal networks, and cooperating and fighting with other players. Players interact with Anarchy Onlines interface via a keyboard and mouse. The game's heads-up display {{consists of a}} series of windows, menus and buttons located {{on the periphery of the}} screen. Players communicate with each other by typing text in chat windows, and occasionally through emotive character animations. Communication with computer-controlled characters is executed via text windows, in which players chose from a menu of possible responses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> being shown.

500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the theme of}} dedicating one's self to the mind, the theme of reception plays heavily upon the poem's presentation; Andrew Bennett states that the poem, like all poems, is [...] "'heard' both by itself (and therefore not heard) and by an audience that reads the poem and 'hears' it differently". Bennett implies that the word [...] "wrung" [...] in line one contains a double entendre as it also alludes to the [...] "ringing in the ears" [...] involved with active listening. The poem's treatment of the reader as a third-party <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> between the narrator and the goddess exemplifies the narrative question common among many of Keats's odes and leads Bennett to question how exactly the reader should regard his place within the poem, or outside of it.|$|E

500|$|At {{the bowling}} alley, Mort Goldman bowls a perfect game and becomes an {{overnight}} celebrity. Lois arrives to pick Peter {{up from the}} bowling alley, but discovers Quagmire spying on her from {{the ceiling of the}} ladies' toilet. Quagmire is beaten up then arrested, but released shortly after by Joe. On his return, Lois, Bonnie and Loretta reveal that they're petitioning the city of Quahog to have Quagmire removed from their neighborhood. As Peter and the other guys are defending Quagmire, Ernie the Giant Chicken attacks Peter and starts a fight that causes huge casualties inside and outside of Quahog. After the fight, Peter returns to the neighborhood to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> and tells the women that, [...] "Quagmire's a good guy, he's just a little mixed up, that's all!" [...] Eventually, the women agree to let Quagmire stay in the neighborhood so long as he manages to control his perverse behavior. Quagmire's taught self-control through operant conditioning by Peter and his friends, and is eventually allowed out in public. Soon, however, he is distracted by women playing in a fountain in the shopping mall and panics, running into a CCTV camera operation room monitoring women's changing rooms. Discovering that a lady in a fitting room is having a heart attack, he appears to rush to her aid, performing CPR and saving her life. Quagmire is congratulated for his heroism, but his intention had been to molest the woman while she was unconscious (which he reveals by asking [...] "What the hell is CPR?").|$|E

Meanwhile, Mars' [...] "Money Make Her Smile" [...] can be heard from the room, the two of them are talking about a new girl who has been [...] "fooling around" [...] with someone else's man (Mr. Mars). The scene ends with one of the two women saying, [...] "Wait 'til I tell the boss what she's sleeping with". It is shown that the new girl, Isabella, has been listening <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> and it's her time to dance as soon as the boss says so. The role of Isabella is portrayed by Indian actress Freida Pinto, who after an introduction by Guzmán, the zoo owner, starts to pull off [...] "gravity-defying spins on the pole" [...] as Mars and his mates, who serve as the house band, perform the song. On the following scene, Isabella sheds her clothes with such rage that sparks fall from the ceiling while Mars stares at her intensely singing [...] "You and me baby making love like gorillas". As the second verse starts, intermittent shots of Mars and Isabella [...] "heating up the backseat of a car" [...] along with shots of her [...] "grinding on customers" [...] and banging on Mars' chest as he sings the line [...] "Bang Bang, Gorilla". The former shots are shown throughout the video. As the video continues, Isabella is shown [...] "to drop on her knees and lick" [...] Mars' guitar. She grabs it and pours tequila over the same, before using a lighter to set it on fire. Afterwards, the roof sprinklers come on and Isabella lets the water shower her while she stands on her underwear. The video ends in a chase scene in which Mars runs down through a dimly lit aisle, and suddenly transforms into a giant gorilla, while Isabella is seen {{at the end of the}} pathway waiting for him. The video doesn't contain any of the teasers Mars released days before the video, including the iguana shot, the outer car scene and the one with Luis Guzman listening to the intro for Isabella.|$|E
