5|$|Crossing the Water {{is full of}} {{perfectly}} realised works. Its most striking impression is of a front-rank artist {{in the process of}} discovering her <b>true</b> <b>power.</b> Such is Plath's control that the book possesses a singularity and certainty which should make it as celebrated as The Colossus or Ariel.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Tenar does not become a wizard (like Ged) or a king (like Arren, the primary {{character}} of The Farthest Shore), Cummins argues that her growth is more revolutionary than either of theirs. In contrast to the male bildungsroman in which characters grow into the characteristics society believes they should have, Tenar's coming of age is a female bildungsroman, in which she must struggle against the patriarchal Kargish empire. She learns to value herself for herself and not simply {{for her role as}} a priestess. She is helped through this process by Ged, who sees her as a powerful person, and helps her find choices that she did not see. Over the course of the story she realized that her <b>true</b> <b>power</b> is not her authority as the reincarnated high priestess, but the ability to make the choice to leave the labyrinth and the Tombs. Le Guin suggests that <b>true</b> <b>power</b> is not only about authority and mastery, but trust and collaboration.|$|E
5|$|While in Nassau, {{during the}} final {{shooting}} days, special-effects supervisor John Stears was supplied experimental rocket fuel to use in exploding Largo's yacht. Ignoring the <b>true</b> <b>power</b> of the volatile liquid, Stears doused the entire yacht with it, took cover, and then detonated the boat. The resultant massive explosion shattered windows along Bay Street in Nassau roughly 30 miles away. Stears {{went on to win}} an Academy Award for his work on Thunderball.|$|E
5|$|Infiltrating the Warlock Lord's {{fortress}} in the Skull Mountain, Shea {{reaches the}} sword and unsheathes it. He learns about its <b>true</b> <b>power,</b> {{the ability to}} confront those with the truth about their lives. The Warlock Lord materializes and tries to destroy Shea, but the youth stands his ground and confronts his enemy with the sword. Although immune to physical weapons, the Warlock Lord vanishes after being forced to confront the truth about himself: he had deluded himself into believing that he is immortal, but this is impossible. The Sword forces him to confront this paradox, and it kills him.|$|E

5|$|As Rand's story begins, he is {{restoring}} {{order in}} the nation of Arad Doman while searching for Graendal, one of the Dark One's favored servants known as the Forsaken. The Aes Sedai work with Rand to interrogate Semirhage, another Forsaken captured {{at the end of}} Knife of Dreams. After being freed by her allies, Semirhage is given a Domination Band, an item used to control male channelers, and locks it around Rand's neck. She and Black Ajah sister Elza Penfell use it to make him torture and attempt to kill his lover, Min Farshaw. Unable to channel, he reaches out and inexplicably accesses the <b>True</b> <b>Power,</b> a different power normally only granted by the Dark One, using it to free himself and kill Semirhage and Elza. After this, he resolves to make himself harder and emotionless. He banishes his adviser Cadsuane Melaidhrin for not securing the Domination Band, promising to kill her if he sees her face again.|$|E
5|$|On , the Mongol leader Hulagu sent through John the Hungarian a new {{letter to}} King Louis IX of France, again {{offering}} an alliance. The letter explained that previously, the Mongols {{had been under}} the impression that the pope was the leader of the Christians, but now they realized that the <b>true</b> <b>power</b> rested with the French monarchy. The letter mentioned Hulagu's intention to capture Jerusalem {{for the benefit of the}} pope, and asked for Louis to send a fleet against Egypt. Hulagu promised the restoration of Jerusalem to the Christians, but also still insisted on Mongol sovereignty, in the Mongols' quest for conquering the world. It is unclear whether or not King Louis actually received the letter, but at some point it was transmitted to Pope Urban, who answered in a similar way as his predecessors. In his papal bull Exultavit cor nostrum, Urban congratulated Hulagu on his expression of goodwill towards the Christian faith, and encouraged him to convert to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Torrijos {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} on July 31, 1981. A later {{investigation}} by the aircraft manufacturer stated it was an accident; Noriega's authority over the government investigation led to speculation about his involvement. Florencio Flores Aguilar had inherited Torrijos position, but <b>true</b> <b>power</b> lay with the trio of Noriega, Díaz Herrera, and Rubén Darío Paredes, who ranked just below him. Flores was removed in a quiet coup on March 3, 1982, after which Paredes was made leader until 1983 by general agreement, after which the military would work together to ensure his election as the president in the election scheduled for 1984. During this period Noriega became a full Colonel and the National Guard's chief of staff, effectively the second-highest rank in the country. He reformed the National Guard as the Panama Defense Forces (PDF), and with the financial assistance of the U.S., expanded and modernized it. The quick promotions they received earned him the officer corps' loyalty. Among the steps he took to consolidate his control was to bring the various factions of the army together into the PDF. On August 12, 1983, in keeping with Noriega's earlier deal with Paredes, Paredes handed over his position to Noriega, newly appointed a General, with the understanding that Noriega would allow him to stand for President. However, Paredes never received the political support he expected, and after assuming his new position Noriega reneged on the deal, telling Paredes he could not contest the election. Noriega, now head of the PDF, thus became the de facto ruler of Panama.|$|E

Though remorseful for his actions and recognizing that he deserves punishment, Solas deems himself too important to be killed, claiming that the elves need him. He embraces Flemeth and seemingly petrifies her, resulting in his eyes glowing.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution of the Roman Empire was {{an unwritten}} set of {{guidelines}} and principles passed down mainly through precedent. After {{the fall of the}} Roman Republic, the constitutional balance of power shifted from the Roman Senate to the Roman Emperor. Beginning with the first emperor, Augustus, the emperor and the senate were theoretically two co-equal branches of government. In practice, however, the actual authority of the imperial Senate was negligible, as the emperor held the <b>true</b> <b>power</b> of the state. During the reign of the second emperor, Tiberius, many of the powers that had been held by the Roman assemblies were transferred to the Senate.|$|E
25|$|Some men {{and women}} in the story have the natural ability to access a form of magic called the One Power; through a process called channeling. The One Power {{consists}} of male and female halves called saidin (accessible by men) and saidar (accessible by women). The One Power is further divided into the 'Five Powers': Earth, Water, Air, Fire, and Spirit. In addition to granting access to the One Power, the ability to channel greatly extends longevity and masks the effects of aging. Channeling itself is described as a euphoric, drug-like experience of life involving the enhancement of all senses, making ordinary life seem dull and grey. A contrary power, dubbed the <b>True</b> <b>Power,</b> is associated with Shai'tan.|$|E

25|$|Like many of Butler’s strong female African-American characters, Anyanwu {{is put in}} {{conflict}} with a male character, Doro, who is just as powerful as her. Butler uses this type of mis-match to display how differently males and females demonstrate their power and values. Since Anyanwu’s way, J. Andrew Deman notes, “is {{the way of the}} healer” rather than of the killer, she does not need violence to demonstrate her true strength or power. As Gant-Britton states, Anyanwu’s <b>true</b> <b>power</b> is shown many times during the story but it is definitely displayed when she threatens to commit suicide if Doro does not stop using her to create new species, making Doro submissive “to her will in the name of love,” if only for a moment.|$|E

Beginning with the first emperor, Augustus, the emperor and the senate were technically two co-equal branches of government. In practice, however the actual authority of the imperial senate was negligible, as the emperor held the <b>true</b> <b>power</b> of the state. As such, membership in the senate became sought after by individuals seeking prestige and social standing, rather than actual authority. During the reigns of the first emperors, legislative, judicial, and electoral powers were all transferred from the Roman assemblies to the senate. However, since the control that the emperor held over the senate was absolute, the senate acted as a vehicle through which the emperor exercised his autocratic powers.|$|E

DAP advisor Lim Kit Siang expressed surprise at the election results but declared it to be the <b>true</b> <b>power</b> of the voice of the Malaysian people for the leaders of the country to hear them.
