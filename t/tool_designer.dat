5000|$|Embodied {{cognition}} is a <b>tool</b> <b>designers</b> can use {{to study}} [...] "human behavior normally unobservable {{in order to create}} human-centric designs".

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest in using computer-based "critic tools" for supporting the end-users or <b>tool</b> <b>designers</b> in analyzing and proactively improving their design artifacts. Several approaches have been applied to designing and realizing such critics, for example rule-based, pattern-matching and knowledge-based approaches. While many studies have found evidence that critic tools are an efficient feedback-providing mechanism, there is still insufficient knowledge about how to provide an effective critic authoring environment. In this paper we apply a business rule template approach as a mechanism to specify and realize critics for Marama-based domain-specific visual language tools. We describe a visual design critic authoring template approach that supports end-users or <b>tool</b> <b>designers</b> in the construction of critics for any Marama-based tools...|$|R

50|$|The {{effect of}} {{legislation}} in various countries on worker vibration limits {{has been to}} oblige equipment providers to develop better-designed, better-maintained tools, and for employers to train workers appropriately. It also drives <b>tool</b> <b>designers</b> to innovate to reduce vibration. Some examples are the easily manipulated mechanical arm (EMMA) and the suspension mechanism designed into chainsaws.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{framework}} for describing, comparing and understanding tools for the mining of software repositories. The fundamental premise of this framework is that mining should be done by considering {{the specific needs of}} the users and the tasks to be supported by the mined information. First, different types of users have distinct needs, and these needs should be taken into account by <b>tool</b> <b>designers.</b> Second, the data sources available, and mined, will determine if those needs can be satisfied. Our framework is based upon three main principles: the type of user, the objective of the user, and the mined information. This framework has the following purposes: to help <b>tool</b> <b>designers</b> in the understanding and comparison of different tools, to assist users in the assessment of a potential tool; and to identify new research areas. We use this framework to describe several mining tools and to suggest future research directions. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{problems}} encountered in evolving software development tools, in particular, configuration management tools, drawing on our experience in producing the DaSC configuration management toolset. Building good software development tools is a time-consuming, iterative process where the <b>tool</b> <b>designers</b> {{must take into}} account the evolving nature of the software development process embodied in the tools, the evolving nature of the environment in which the tools exist, and the evolving understanding that the <b>tool</b> <b>designers</b> have of the users of the tools. We believe that our experience with the tools that we have developed is applicable to other kinds of tools used in industrial settings. Key Words: Software development, software tools, configuration management, optimistic concurrency control. 1. Introduction In the Software Engineering Laboratory at the National Research Council of Canada, we have been developing tools for configuration management for eight years. These tools w [...] ...|$|R

The {{press-in}} method offers an alternative technique of pile installation, which allows pre-formed piles to be installed with minimal noise and vibration. Field measurements of noise and ground vibrations during press-in piling are presented and compared to existing recommended limits.

40|$|The game {{design process}} is largely driven by practice. While some {{work has been}} done in academia {{targeting}} the definition of a theoretical foundation for the process of game design, these two communities rarely came together to discuss their perspective theories or processes. As a result, both communities work in isolation. The game industry is often involved in game-specific game design methodologies and academics are concerned with theoretical foundations. The goal of this workshop is to start a dialogue between the two communities and generate general themes and underlying theories. These theories will serve to aid game designers in constructing games, and help <b>tool</b> <b>designers</b> build <b>tools</b> that allow <b>designers</b> to focus on critical issues...|$|R
