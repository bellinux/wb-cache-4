5|$|Elizabeth was {{regarded}} by her contemporaries as an efficient but ruthless politician who used political intrigues {{to protect and}} defend her daughters' rights. She was a caring parent, but was neither politically talented nor competent to prepare Mary and Hedwig for their roles as monarchs. Elizabeth failed to {{set a good example}} for her daughters, and her unbalanced character and questionable methods in politics would serve more as a warning to the young sovereigns. Her procrastinations and inability <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>clear</b> decisions threatened Hedwig's status, while her endless problems with Croatian nobles and failure to improve relations with her native Bosnia made Mary's reign insecure and tumultuous.|$|E
5|$|Madison {{argued that}} a state, after declaring a federal law unconstitutional, could take action by {{communicating}} with other states, attempting to enlist their support, petitioning Congress to repeal the law in question, introducing amendments to the Constitution in Congress, or calling a constitutional convention. Madison did not assert that the states could legally nullify an objectionable federal law or that they could declare it void and unenforceable. By eschewing direct action in favor of influencing popular opinion, Madison tried <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>clear</b> that the Democratic-Republicans were not moving toward disunion.|$|E
5|$|Young's {{claims that}} the new decipherments were merely a {{corroboration}} of his own method, meant that Champollion would have to publish more of his data <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>clear</b> {{the degree to which}} his own progress built on a systematicity that was not found in Young's work. He realized {{that he would have to}} make it apparent to all that his was a total system of decipherment, whereas Young had merely deciphered a few words. Over the next year he published a series of booklets about the Egyptian gods, including some decipherments of their names.|$|E

5|$|The {{only real}} {{threat of a}} black {{rebellion}} in Southern Rhodesia during the war occurred in May 1916, immediately after the Company instructed native commissioners in Matabeleland to start recruiting for the Rhodesia Native Regiment. Company officials attempted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>clear</b> that the RNR comprised volunteers only, and most Matabele chiefs were not unreceptive to the idea—some, including Chief Ndiweni, attempted to encourage enlistment by sending their own sons off to war—but rumours spread in some quarters that black men {{were going to be}} involuntarily conscripted wholesale into the unit. Chief Maduna, in Insiza district, briefly threatened insurrection, issuing rifles to 100 men, but he backed down after a few weeks after it became self-evident that conscription was not happening. Some attempted to dissuade potential RNR recruits from signing up, including a black man in Bulawayo who was fined £4 in July 1915 for spreading a false rumour around the city that the British East Africa Transport Corps' black Southern Rhodesian drivers had had their throats cut by the Germans. Matthew Zwimba, founder of the syncretist Church of the White Bird in Mashonaland, received six months' hard labour the following year for advising black men not to join the RNR {{on the grounds that the}} British had, he said, committed crimes against God in 1913.|$|E

Mixed anti-personnel and anti-tank minefields, anti-personnel mines under anti-tank mines, and fuses separated from mines {{have all been}} used for this purpose. Often, single mines are backed by a secondary device, designed to kill or maim personnel tasked with clearing the mine.|$|R

Some anti-tank mine types are also able to be triggered by infantry, giving them a dual purpose even though their main and official intention is to work as anti-tank weapons.|$|R

25|$|The {{recently}} discovered inscription for Nefertiti as queen in Regnal Year 16, if verified, seems <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>clear</b> {{she was still}} alive and still queen. What Egyptologists will make of it remains to be seen, but with proof of her alive in Year 16, it could be seen as supporting her candidacy as Neferneferuaten. On the other hand, advocates for Smenkhkare may make the case that since she attested as queen just before the start of Akhenaten's final regnal year, then Smenkhkare {{is more likely to be}} Akhenaten's successor.|$|E
25|$|This text (original title: Expositio sermonum antiquorum), {{addressed}} {{to a person}} named Calcidium in some manuscripts, is an explanation of 62 antique Latin words that {{may be found in}} Roman literature. In his Prologue to the work, Fulgentius states that he compiled the list of words in order to fulfill the commissions assigned by his master (who remains unidentified). His stated aim is <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>clear</b> the meaning of these words, not to revive them. However, beginning in the Carolingian period, writers did in fact make use of these rarities, using this text as their source.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, John Bloomfield's {{portrait}} of Tim Burstall was disqualified {{on the grounds}} that it had been painted from a blown up photograph, rather than from life. The prize was then awarded to Kevin Connor. In 1981 legal action was threatened by John Bloomfield claiming that the winner that year, Eric Smith, had not painted his subject from life. In 1983 John Bloomfield sued for the return of the 1975 prize which was unsuccessful. In 1995 the application form of the Archibald Prize was modified based on this <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>clear</b> that the subject must be painted from life.|$|E

25|$|Captain De Jong {{was acquitted}} of the charge of treason, for lack of evidence, but {{he was convicted of}} {{dereliction}} of duty. He was cashiered; had to undergo a symbolic simulated execution (whereby a sword was swung over his head), and was banished for life. The trials were then suspended in hope that the absent officers would become available. In July 1801 the trial was resumed with new indictments against officers who had surrendered ships on earlier occasions or been otherwise derelict. Several other officers were punished in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>clear</b> to the officer corps that surrender without a fight was unacceptable.|$|E

In October 2003, she joined the Senate Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on Palestinian textbooks and other media that glorifies violence and martyrdom.|$|E
25|$|Beatrice {{was then}} rumoured to be {{intending}} to marry Alfonso XIII of Spain, but this {{proved to be}} a false rumour also as he married her cousin Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg in 1906. It was at their wedding that Beatrice met a cousin of King Alfonso, Alfonso de Orleans y Borbón (12 November 1886 Madrid, Spain–10 August 1975), Infante of Spain, 5th Duke of Galliera. The Spanish government objected to an infantes proposed match with a British Princess who, unlike Queen Victoria Eugenie, had not agreed to convert to Roman Catholicism: the King was obliged <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>clear</b> that, should the wedding take place, the couple would have to live in exile.|$|E
