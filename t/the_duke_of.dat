5|$|During a {{temporary}} physical infirmity or an {{absence from the}} kingdom, the sovereign may temporarily delegate some {{of his or her}} functions to Counsellors of State, the monarch's spouse and the first four adults in the line of succession. The present Counsellors of State are: <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Cambridge, Prince Harry and <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> York.|$|E
5|$|At birth, Victoria was {{fifth in}} the line of {{succession}} after the four eldest sons of GeorgeIII: George, the Prince Regent (later GeorgeIV); Frederick, <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> York; William, <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Clarence (later WilliamIV); and Victoria's father, Edward, <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Kent. The Prince Regent had no surviving children, and <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> York had no children; further, both were estranged from their wives, who were both past child-bearing age, so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further children. <b>The</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Clarence and <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Kent married on the same day in 1818, but both of Clarence's daughters (born in 1819 and 1820) died as infants. Victoria's father died in January 1820, when Victoria was less than a year old. A week later her grandfather died and was succeeded by his eldest son, GeorgeIV. <b>The</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> York died in 1827. When GeorgeIV died in 1830, he was succeeded by his next surviving brother, WilliamIV, and Victoria became heir presumptive. The Regency Act 1830 made special provision for the Duchess of Kent (Victoria's mother) to act as regent in case William died while Victoria was still a minor. King William distrusted the Duchess's capacity to be regent, and in 1836 he declared in her presence that he wanted to live until Victoria's 18th birthday, so that a regency could be avoided.|$|E

50|$|In feudal and dynastic terms, the Scottish {{reliance}} on French support was revived {{during the reign}} of Charles II, whose own mother was French. His sister Henrietta married into the French royal family. Charles II left no legitimate children, but his numerous illegitimate descendants included <b>the</b> <b>Dukes</b> <b>of</b> Buccleuch, <b>the</b> <b>Dukes</b> <b>of</b> Grafton, <b>the</b> <b>Dukes</b> <b>of</b> Saint Albans and <b>the</b> <b>Dukes</b> <b>of</b> Richmond.|$|R
5|$|George {{was born}} at St James's Palace, London, on 12 August 1762, the first child of King George III of the United Kingdom and Queen Charlotte. As the eldest son of a British sovereign, he {{automatically}} became Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay at birth; he was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester a few days later. On 18 September of the same year, he was baptised by Thomas Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury. His godparents were <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Mecklenburg-Strelitz (his maternal uncle, for whom <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Devonshire, Lord Chamberlain, stood proxy), <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Cumberland (his paternal great-uncle) and the Dowager Princess of Wales (his paternal grandmother). George was a talented student, and quickly learned to speak French, German and Italian, {{in addition to his}} native English.|$|E
5|$|In 1673, <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> York's {{conversion}} to Catholicism became public, and {{he married a}} Catholic princess, Mary of Modena, who was only {{six and a half}} years older than Anne. Charles II had no legitimate children, and so <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> York was next in the line of succession, followed by his two surviving daughters from his first marriage, Mary and Anne—as long as he had no son. Over the next ten years, the new Duchess of York had ten children, but all were either stillborn or died in infancy, leaving Mary and Anne second and third in the line of succession after their father. There is every indication that, throughout Anne's early life, she and her stepmother got on well together, and <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> York was a conscientious and loving father.|$|E

5|$|Although the Boleyn {{family still}} held {{important}} {{positions on the}} Privy Council, Anne had many enemies, including <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Suffolk. Even her own uncle, <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Norfolk, had come to resent her attitude to her power. The Boleyns preferred France over the Emperor as a potential ally, but the King's favour had swung towards the latter (partly because of Cromwell), damaging the family's influence. Also opposed to Anne were supporters of reconciliation with Princess Mary (among them the former supporters of Catherine), who had reached maturity. A second annulment was now a real possibility, although it is commonly {{believed that it was}} Cromwell's anti-Boleyn influence that led opponents to look for a way of having her executed.|$|E
