The engine was a pre-World War II design by BMW which by the 1960s was considered dated. Bristol decided in 1961 to cease production of its engine and instead to use Chrysler [...] V8 engines. AC started using the 2.6 litre Ford Zephyr engine in its cars.|$|E

25|$|A smaller <b>two-seater</b> sports <b>roadster</b> {{was created}} {{at the behest}} of Henry Ford II in 1953 called the Vega. The {{completed}} one-off generated interest at the time, but had meager power, European looks, and a correspondingly high cost, so it never proceeded to production. The Thunderbird was similar in concept, but would be more American in style, more luxurious, and less sport-oriented.|$|R

5000|$|The Alpine {{was derived}} from the Sunbeam-Talbot 90 Saloon, and has become colloquially known as the [...] "Talbot" [...] Alpine. It was a <b>two-seater</b> sports <b>roadster</b> {{initially}} developed for a one-off rally car by Bournemouth Sunbeam-Talbot dealer George Hartnell. It had its beginnings as a 1952 Sunbeam-Talbot drophead coupé. Announced in March 1953 it received its name following Sunbeam-Talbot saloons successes in the Alpine Rally during the early 1950s. On its first competitive outing, the July 1953 Coupe des Alpes, the new car won the Coupe des Dames (Sheila van Damm) and, without loss of any marks, four Coupes des Alpes driven by Stirling Moss, John Fitch, G Murray-Frame and Sheila van Damm.|$|R
50|$|The XK120 was {{launched}} in open <b>two-seater</b> or (US) <b>roadster</b> form at the 1948 London Motor Show as a testbed and show car for the new Jaguar XK engine. The display car was the first prototype, chassis number 660001. It looked almost identical to the production cars except that the straight outer pillars of its windscreen would be curved on the production version. The roadster caused a sensation, which persuaded Jaguar founder and design boss William Lyons {{to put it into}} production.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>two-seater</b> steel <b>roadster</b> {{bodywork}} was {{an unusually}} faithful {{replica of the}} celebrated MG TF. As with the MG TF, the TF 1700 had a front engine and rear-wheel drive. The Naylor was also uncommonly well-equipped (and as a result expensive), with Connolly leather interior and real spoked wheels. Its price in 1985 was GBP13,950, only forty pounds less than the considerably more powerful Morgan Plus 8 Injection. Like the Morgan, the Naylor has a body constructed from metal panels attached to a wooden body-frame constructed from ash wood (not {{to be confused with}} the chassis, which is steel in both the Naylor and the Morgan). Most of the car's mechanicals came straight from the Morris Marina/Ital, including the 1.7 litre SOHC O-series engine with [...] and the four-speed manual transmission. The rear axle was the Marina's live unit with coil springs. The front suspension is independent, with coil sprung MacPherson struts, and a rack-and-pinion steering. Top speed is 151 km/h. The TF 1700 was fully type-approved and came with a warranty from the Austin Rover Group.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1948, the Sunbeam-Talbot 80 and Sunbeam-Talbot 90 were introduced, with a totally new {{streamlined}} design with flowing front fenders (wings). The 80 used the Hillman Minx-based engine with ohv and the 90 utilised {{a modified version of}} the Humber Hawk with ohv. The car bodies were manufactured by another Rootes Group company, British Light Steel Pressings of Acton, however the convertible drophead coupé shells were completed by Thrupp & Maberly coachbuilders in Cricklewood. The underpowered 80 was discontinued in 1950. The 90 was renamed the 90 Mark II and then the 90 Mark IIA and eventually in 1954 the Sunbeam Mark III, finally dropping the Talbot name. With the model name changes, the headlights were raised on the front fenders and an independent coil front suspension and the engine displacement went from 1944 cc to 2267 cc with a high compression head and developing [...]There was one more model of the Sunbeam-Talbot that appeared in 1953 in the form of an Alpine, a <b>two-seater</b> sports <b>roadster</b> which was initially developed by a Sunbeam-Talbot dealer George Hartwell in Bournemouth as a one-off rally car that had its beginnings as a 1952 drophead coupé. It was named supposedly by Norman Garrad, (works Competition Department) who was heavily involved in the Sunbeam-Talbot successes in the Alpine Rally in the early 1950s using the Saloon model. The Alpine Mark I and Mark III (a Mark II was never made) were hand built like the Drophead Coupé at Thrupp & Maberly coachbuilders from 1953 to 1955 when production ceased after close to 3000 were produced. It has been estimated that perhaps only 200 remain in existence today. The Talbot name was dropped in 1954 for the Sunbeam Alpine sports car, making Sunbeam the sports-performance marque. In 1955 a Sunbeam saloon won the Monte Carlo Rally. Production ceased in 1956 and was replaced by the sporty Sunbeam Rapier.|$|R
5000|$|The car {{featured}} a side-valve four-cylinder engine of 1327cc (12 HP) {{and sat on}} a 2600 mm wheelbase. [...] Three different body styles were offered - a <b>two-seater</b> <b>roadster,</b> a tourer and a closed saloon.|$|E

50|$|Karmann {{was asked}} to build a four-seater, another coach-builder, Hebmüller, {{was asked to}} make a <b>two-seater</b> <b>roadster.</b> Its design was not unlike the 'Radclyffe Roadster', with a similar hood and side windows. The rear engine cover, however, was a hand-formed panel, not a {{converted}} front bonnet as was the Radclyffe version.|$|E
50|$|What Chrysler {{was lacking}} was a <b>two-seater</b> <b>roadster</b> {{to compete with}} the Ford Falcon and General Motors's Chevrolet Corvette. For the shorter length needed for a roadster, the chassis of the Plymouth valiant was adopted. A 170cid I-6 engine with outputs of more than 200 {{horsepower}} was a suitable choice.|$|E
50|$|The Autoette was an {{automobile}} manufactured in Manistee, Michigan, by the Manistee Motor Car Company from 1910-13. The Autoette {{was one of}} the first cyclecars.
