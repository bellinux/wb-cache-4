Lo danced with until saying “I do” is her second husband Cris Judd, a professional dancer and choreographer. The lyrics go on to reference two more men, who {{would seem to be}} Ben Affleck (“went nowhere but kept the ring”) and Lopez’s current husband, Marc Anthony (“he sang to me.”)" [...] Allison Stewart from The Washington Post said that [...] "One Love" [...] examines all of her high-profiled relationships, and commented that Lopez is not [...] "trying to gin up controversy with these red-meat tidbits about her personal life.

500|$|In November 2009, it was {{reported}} that Stanton would reprise her role as Jill. Digital Spy forum members had previously pointed out that her return was hinted at in a photo on the official EastEnders website and in a feature ("Script Peek") where Phil is quoted as saying, [...] "I know exactly what makes her tick" [...] before adding [...] "I've wriggled off her hook so many times. She's already picturing me standing in the dock" [...] in the 29 December episode. Marsden returned to investigate the murder of Archie Mitchell. A source told Digital Spy, [...] "Marsden has a score to settle with Phil. She was never far behind Phil when he put a foot out of place all <b>those</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> and she's back with a vengeance...With so many people in the frame for Archie's murder, Marsden has a difficult job on her hands if she wants to pin it on Phil." [...] Of her return she said, [...] "It came completely out of the blue, and knocked me for six."...I really thought Marsden was no more. It was a really great surprise because I’d just finished a year’s run at the National Theatre, appearing in a new play called England People Very Nice – so it couldn’t have come at a better time."

500|$|On 28 October 2009 it was {{announced}} that Windsor had quit the show and would leave in 2010 after 15 years. She said: [...] "EastEnders has been wonderful to me and it's no secret that it changed my life all of <b>those</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> I'll be so sad to leave Peggy behind; she's such a wonderful character to play. I have had the pleasure of working with a marvellous cast and crew and have made many lasting good friends. To have had the honour of showing the Queen around the set is something that will stay with me forever." [...] Executive producer Diederick Santer said: [...] "Barbara has contributed so much to EastEnders over the last 15 years, plus countless episodes, and countless amazing storylines. Peggy Mitchell is a truly iconic character, and along with Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp, Barbara has made the Mitchells the premier family of British soap." [...] Windsor filmed her final scene on 16 July 2010. Peggy's final episode, which aired on 10 September 2010, was preceded by a number of television trailers in August and a new section on the EastEnders website dedicated to the character. The episode ended with a special reworking of the piano version of the EastEnders theme tune known as [...] "Julia's Theme", called [...] "Peggy's Theme". Tribute was then paid to her in a clip programme, Peggy Mitchell: Queen of the Vic. [...] Peggy's final episode attracted 10.1 million viewers, and was the second most-watched programme in the week of 6–12 September.|$|E
500|$|At first, Nevermind did {{not receive}} many reviews, and many {{publications}} ignored the album. Months after its release and after [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] garnered airplay, print media organizations were [...] "scrambling" [...] to cover the phenomenon the album had become. However, by that point, much of the attention fell on Cobain rather than the album itself. The reviews that did initially appear were largely positive. Karen Schoemer of The New York Times wrote, [...] "With 'Nevermind,' Nirvana has certainly succeeded. There are enough intriguing textures, mood shifts, instrumental snippets and inventive word plays to provide for hours of entertainment." [...] Schoemer concluded, [...] "'Nevermind' is more sophisticated and carefully produced than anything peer bands like Dinosaur Jr. and Mudhoney have yet offered." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave Nevermind an A– rating, and reviewer David Browne argued that on Nevermind, Nirvana [...] "never entertain the notion" [...] of wanting to sound [...] "normal," [...] compared to other contemporary alternative bands. Concluding his very enthusiastic review for the British Melody Maker, Everett True wrote that [...] "When Nirvana released Bleach all <b>those</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> the more sussed among us figured they {{had the potential to}} make an album that would blow every other contender away. My God have they proved us right." [...] Spin gave Nevermind a favorable review stating that [...] "you'll be humming all the songs {{for the rest of your}} life—or at least until your CD-tape-album wears out." [...] Select compared the band to Jane's Addiction, Sonic Youth, and the Pixies, stating that the album [...] "proves that Nirvana truly belong in such high company." ...|$|E

[...] Nonetheless, the captain welcomed him as a Christian and asked his advice {{about what to do}} with Maquinna. When he heard what exactly had {{happened}} to the Boston, he was inclined to execute him, but Jewitt persuaded him of the impolicy of this, because it would lead to further attacks on other ships visiting. Jewitt negotiated for the return of what property remained of the Boston: its cannons, anchors, and remnants of its cargo, and especially the ship's papers, which he had secured in a chest all <b>those</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Once these were {{on board the}} Lydia, Maquinna was released, and the brig immediately weighed anchor and left Nootka Sound.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Years</b> <b>ago,</b> Harvard University's Office of Government and Community Affairs {{sponsored}} {{an in-depth}} {{study of the}} animal rights movement, examining its tactics, strategies, and long-term goals. Even <b>those</b> many <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> Harvard understood {{that there was a}} conceptual dichotomy in the movement, noting in its Report that [...] "philosophically, animal rights/welfare groups can be classified as abolitionists or regulationists. The abolitionists, such as ISAR…constitute a minority within a movement. They are, however, also the most diligent, tactical and clear thinking. They use the law, publications and education to work for their ultimate goals." [...] (Our italics.) What Harvard said about ISAR those decades ago remains true today.|$|R

2500|$|Executive Producer Santer said, [...] "With all {{the turmoil}} facing the Mitchells this year, {{it feels like}} a great time to bring back Sam, the {{original}} Mitchell sister. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Kim Medcalf for her great work playing Sam Mitchell for three years and welcome Danniella back to pick up the baton once again." [...] In an interview with media website Digital Spy, Santer discussed the reasoning behind his decision to reintroduce Sam: [...] "What makes Sam interesting for me is that she's Ricky's first love and first wife. As Bianca and Ricky spend more time together [...] the inevitability of them at some point coming together increases. What's stopping them? Well, it's Sam. Sam and Ricky had a good thing going all <b>those</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> All Ricky ever gets off Bianca is indifference, whereas Sam - and who knows quite why - is less than indifferent towards him and it makes a nice change".|$|E

I know the audience loved Michelle Fowler so much, and even though she hasn’t been on our screen for 20 years, she’s very much in the fans’ psyche. When I used to watch EastEnders all <b>those</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> she was one of my favourite characters. I’m extremely excited for what is in store for Michelle." [...] Executive producer Sean O'Connor said he is [...] "thrilled to have secured Jenna Russell to play Michelle Fowler, one of the show’s most celebrated characters" [...] and [...] "the Square really has missed her over the past twenty years." [...] O'Connor added, [...] "Jenna was always in mind when I [...] first started planning for Michelle’s return". O'Connor also said Michelle is [...] "still flawed, complicated and infuriating after two decades away, but still loveable all the same. It’s going to be appointment TV watching Michelle’s car crash of a life unravel all over again." ...|$|E

John Chedsey of Satan Stole My Teddybear {{stated that the}} album is [...] "one of the more {{stunning}} and devastatingly powerful debuts of any metal band in any genre." [...] Jim Raggi of Lamentations of the Flame Princess wrote that [...] "perhaps the most easily recognizable voice in all of extreme metal, Mikael Åkerfeldt really does make some noise in his debut. I can't think of very many vocalists in 1994 (when the album was recorded) who used both clean and growled vocals freely. I'm definitely {{not going to go}} so far as to say he was the first (Dan Swanö did beat him on that at least!) but all <b>those</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> Åkerfeldt did set the standard for what the extreme progressive music vocalist should sound like". He added, [...] "The fact is this album is a groundbreaking milestone in heavy metal for the progressive elements that are thrown into the more metallic music and the extreme vocals" [...] and the sound of the album is [...] "completely unique".
