40|$|We {{quantify}} {{the importance of}} trade credit chains for the propagation of corporate bankruptcies. Our results show that trade creditors (suppliers) that issue more trade credit are more exposed to <b>trade</b> <b>debtor</b> (customer) failures, {{both in terms of}} the likelihood of experiencing a debtor failure and the loss given failure. We further document that the credit loss invoked by a debtor failure imposes a substantially enhanced bankruptcy risk on the creditors. The propagation mechanism is mitigated for creditors that are less levered, cash rich, and highly profitable, and enhanced in R&D intense industries and during economic downturns...|$|R
40|$|A dynamic bargaining-theoretic {{framework}} {{is used to}} analyze multilateral negotiations for rescheduling sovereign debt. The analysis illustrates how various factors, such as the <b>debtor's</b> gains from <b>trade</b> {{and the level of}} world interest rates, affect the relative bargaining power of various parties to a rescheduling agreement. If creditor-country taxpayers {{have a vested interest in}} maintaining normal levels of <b>trade</b> with <b>debtor</b> countries, then they can sometimes be bargained into making sidepayments. The benefits from unanticipated creditor-country sidepayments accrue to both lenders and borrowers. But the benefits from perfectly anticipated sidepayments accrue entirely to borrowers. ...|$|R
40|$|This Note implores {{states that}} have not already done so {{to opt out of}} the {{provisions}} of the Federal Bankruptcy Code that place explicit limits on the amount a debtor is allowed to exempt from liquidation. By doing so, states will be able to provide debtors who operate their own small business a greater degree of protection from creditors, as those states are entitled to establish their own limit on the value of the tools of a <b>debtor’s</b> <b>trade</b> the <b>debtor</b> may shield in bankruptcy. This Note contends that Congress has evinced an intent within the last decade to restrict the ability of small business debtors to exempt the value of their assets and that federal judges have shown unwillingness to allow states to provide debtors with a choice between federal exemption limits and state exemption limits. Consequently, it is incumbent upon states to expressly opt out of the relevant portions of the Bankruptcy Code to provide their small business debtors the more generous slate of exemption laws that the evidence suggests these states intended to provide in the first instance...|$|R

This is because the CMUCPP model is generally viewed by accountants as a 1970s failed inflation accounting model that requires all non-monetary items - variable real value non-monetary items and constant real value non-monetary items - to be inflation-adjusted by means of the Consumer Price Index.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Although {{sometimes}} said {{to reflect}} distinctively Japanese modes of economic organization or the general importance of path-dependence and culture, the cross-shareholding patterns within the Japanese keiretsu often display a straightforward economic logic. When keiretsu banks <b>trade</b> on <b>debtor</b> stock, for example, they occasionally {{seem to be}} capturing gains from inside information. When manufacturers in the automobile industry buy stock in their suppliers, they apparently do so to protect relationship-specific investments. And when the pre-war predecessors to the keiretsu invested in component firms, they often invested in ways that resembled the ways silicon valley venture capitalists invest today. Economic form may differ between the U. S. and Japan, but the cross-shareholdings themselves reflect a simple economic rationale...|$|R

Auditors thus became the mediators between the producers and the users of accountant information, using their high theoretical training, authority, competence and independence as pledge for the fairness of the financial statements and for the compliance with the Law.

50|$|For example, an auditor may: {{physically}} examine inventory {{as evidence}} that inventory shown in the accounting records actually exists (existence assertion);inspect supporting documents like invoices to confirm that sales did occur (occurrence); arrange for suppliers to confirm in writing {{the details of the}} amount owing at balance date {{as evidence that}} accounts payable is a liability (rights and obligation assertion); and make inquires of management about the collectibility of customers' accounts as evidence that <b>trade</b> <b>debtors</b> are accurate as to its valuation. Evidence that an account balance or class of transaction is not complete, valid or accurate is evidence of a substantive misstatement but only becomes a material misstatement when it is large enough that it can be expected to influence the decisions of the users of the financial statement.|$|E
50|$|Doubtful debts {{are those}} debts which a {{business}} or individual {{is unlikely to}} be able to collect. The reasons for potential non-payment can include disputes over supply, delivery, the condition of item or the appearance of financial stress within a customer's operations. When such a dispute occurs it is prudent to add this debt or portion thereof to the doubtful debt reserve. This is done to avoid over-stating the assets of the business as <b>trade</b> <b>debtors</b> are reported net of Doubtful debt. When {{there is no longer any}} doubt that a debt is uncollectible, the debt becomes bad. An example of a debt becoming uncollectible would be:- once final payments have been made from the liquidation of a customer's limited liability company, no further action can be taken.|$|E

The bailiff may choose not to remove the goods immediately, giving the debtor an opportunity to pay the debt (plus the bailiff's costs). In the meantime, the bailiff takes walking possession of the goods. The bailiff may ask the debtor to sign a walking possession agreement, listing the goods that have been seized and acknowledging that the debtor no longer has legal title to the goods.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine whether}} the {{cross-country}} incidence {{and severity of}} the 2008 - 2009 global recession is systematically related to pre-crisis macroeconomic and financial factors.

International risk sharing did little to shield domestic demand from the country-specific component of output declines, while those countries with large pre-crisis current account deficits saw domestic demand fall by much more than domestic output during the crisis.

50|$|CMUCPP was {{authorized}} in IFRS in the IASB's original Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, Par. 104 (a) in 1989. In {{terms of the}} original Framework, (1989) Par 104 (a) accountants choose CMUCPP to implement a financial capital concept of invested purchasing power, i.e. financial CMUCPP {{at all levels of}} inflation and deflation instead of the traditional HC concept of invested money. They thus implement a CPP financial capital maintenance concept by measuring financial capital maintenance in units of CPP instead of traditional HC nominal monetary units and they implement a CPP profit/loss determination concept in units of CPP instead of in real value eroding nominal monetary units under HCA. Examples of constant items are issued share capital, retained income, capital reserves, all other items in shareholders´ equity, <b>trade</b> <b>debtors,</b> trade creditors, provisions, deferred tax assets and liabilities, all other non-monetary payables, all other non-monetary receivables, salaries, wages, rentals, all other items in the income statement, etc. Examples of variable items are property, plant, equipment, listed and unlisted shares, inventory, foreign exchange, etc. Variable items are valued in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) at for example fair value, market value, recoverable value, present value, net realizable value, etc. or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) during non-hyperinflationary periods.|$|E

Sovereign default {{may be associated with}} a subsequent decline in international trade either because creditors want to deter default by <b>debtors,</b> or because <b>trade</b> finance dries up after default. To estimate the effect, I use an empirical gravity model of bilateral trade and a large panel data set covering fifty years and more than 200 trading partners. The model controls for a host of factors that influence bilateral trade flows, including the incidence of International Monetary Fund programs. Using the dates of sovereign debt renegotiations conducted through the Paris Club as a proxy measure for sovereign default, I find that renegotiation is associated with an economically and statistically significant decline in bilateral <b>trade</b> between a <b>debtor</b> and its creditors. The decline in bilateral trade is approximately 8 percent a year and persists for about fifteen years. Debts, External; International trade...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1 {{studies the}} {{interaction}} between inequality and house prices using an incomplete market heterogeneous agent model. The model links cross-sectional household portfolio saving decisions to housing market outcomes, contributing to the housing literature by illustrating a new price formation mechanism in which the investment motive among the wealthy plays a key role. A quantitative application of the theory rationalizes puzzling phenomena in China – notably, its recent substantial housing boom accompanied by rising savings rates. The theory in this paper shows that market frictions can have differential impacts cross-sectionally, increasing the risk of an explosion of inequality. This adds {{to the understanding of}} a broader topic: how inequality and macroeconomic forces can interact. Chapter 2 explores the welfare and distributional effects of fiscal uncertainty in a neoclassical stochastic growth model with incomplete markets, where households face uninsurable idiosyncratic risks in their labor income and discount factor processes. Aggregate uncertainty arises from both productivity and government purchases shocks. Starting from an initial situation calibrated to key features of the U. S. economy, we eliminate government purchases shocks but keep the aggregate productivity process. We then evaluate the distributional consequences of the elimination of fiscal uncertainty and find, in the baseline case, welfare gains that decline with private wealth holdings. Chapter 3 offers new theoretical and empirical insights into the effect of sovereign defaults on trade. We contend that sovereign debt renegotiation is associated not with trade sanction but with <b>trade</b> benefit between <b>debtor</b> countries and creditor countries. We find empirical support for the argument from the changes in trade share after debt renegotiations as well as the Aid-for-trade statistics. We build a two-country DSGE model with incomplete market to explain why trade sanction is not observed. We reason that creditors lower <b>trade</b> costs with <b>debtors</b> in hope to collect the remaining debt during debt renegotiations. The adjustment, in turn, affects debtors' default decisions. The model departs from the existing literature on sovereign defaults by introducing the strategic interaction between debtors and creditors. We solve the model numerically to determine the optimal trade costs given different combinations of debt and income levels...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} motivations for a firm's demand for trade credit. Demand for credit is {{modelled}} {{as a function}} of transaction costs motivations, financing motivations, operational considerations, seller compliance issues and supplier marketing, whilst controlling for the firm's business environment and for firm characteristics such as size and industry. This paper builds on previous studies by considering a wider range of factors that can affect trade credit demand holistically on a single sample. It appears that the use of trade credit is widespread, and that it is generally perceived as an important short term financing option, although the availability of trade credit is not a major influence on supplier choice. The level of a firm's trade credit demand is found to be significantly influenced by transaction costs, financing, operational issues, marketing activities by suppliers, the firm's investment in <b>trade</b> <b>debtors</b> and firm size.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of trade credit extension and the association between late payment from <b>trade</b> <b>debtors</b> and profitability in the Malaysian manufacturing sector. It is based on exploratory data analysis and ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions on a crosssectional sample of 383 and 287 public-listed manufacturing companies, respectively, using audited financial statements for the financial year ending 2007 / 2008. Investment in accounts receivables is even higher than in inventories in the Malaysian manufacturing sector. Contrary to previous studies, this study finds that large companies,manufacturers with higher liquidity and with higher collateral assets extend less trade credit, indicating that the listed manufacturing sector has the market power in trade credit extension and uses trade credit as a price discrimination tool. However, when experiencing from late collection of payment, these listed manufacturers seek more liquidity security coverage by tightening their credit extension irrespective of how lucrative trade credit is as a price discrimination tool in business.
