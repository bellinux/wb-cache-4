40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) has {{the capacity}} to probe <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> topography <b>of</b> a variety of materials with atomic scale resolution. Unlike scanning tunneling microscopy AFM does not depend on the sample being an electrical conductor and therefore provides an ideal way to image <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> nonconducting molecular crystals. Many studies have focused on characterizing <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> metals or semiconductor crystals. An alternative and potentially important application of AFM is to <b>the</b> characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> biochemical crystals, with a view to mapping out active sites in proteins. While AFM has been able to resolve <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> structure <b>of</b> crystals with atomic scale resolution, an important issue is the unique identification <b>of</b> individual <b>surface</b> atoms; for example, to use AFM to determine which cleavage plane of a molecular crystal is exposed.
