In another book, the Wilis are said to be jilted young women who have died and become vampires. This is assumed to be the reason that <b>they</b> <b>hate</b> men.|$|E

Yet a peasant named Yelisey tells the group that the coffins belong to his village. Yelisey carries away the coffins, which are tied {{together}} by a long strand of rope. Voschev follows the peasant's trail. Kozlov unexpectedly shows up at the worksite wearing an expensive suit, the result of having been appointed chairman of the labor union council. Pashkin, who is now Kozlov's driver, tells the group that the peasants in a nearby village are looking to collectivize their farms. The workers decide that Kozlov and Safronov, even though <b>they</b> <b>hate</b> each other, will lead the collectivization process.|$|E

500|$|Given little {{instruction}} from the studio, screenwriter Deborah Moggach spent {{over two years}} adapting Pride and Prejudice for film. She had sole discretion with the early script, and eventually wrote approximately ten drafts. Realising it held [...] "a perfect three-act structure", Moggach attempted to be as faithful to the original novel as possible, calling it [...] "so beautifully shaped as a story – the ultimate romance about two people who think <b>they</b> <b>hate</b> each other but who are really passionately in love.

500|$|Perry has a {{theme song}} {{tentatively}} entitled [...] "Perry," [...] performed by Randy Crenshaw and Laura Dickinson, and written by Povenmire and Marsh, who write {{the majority of}} songs in the series. The song, along with the number [...] "Gitchee Gitchee Goo" [...] from the episode [...] "Flop Starz," [...] was the first musical composition Povenmire and Marsh pitched to The Walt Disney Company. They were nervous doing so, because, as Povenmire explained, [...] "Disney has a big history of music -- what if <b>they</b> <b>hate</b> it?" [...] Their reaction, however, was considerably positive and the pair was asked to write a song for each episode, which they vehemently agreed to. The opening lyrics for the song describe Perry as a standard textbook definition of a platypus: [...] "He's a semi-aquatic egg-laying mammal of action." ...|$|E

Bangaa in Final Fantasy XII are often considered to be the most integrated of all races into Hume society, and are the race most friendly with the latter, as exemplified with Migelo. Bangaa possess great agility and strength, and acute senses of hearing and smell, making them excellent hunters and fighters. However, their eyesight is so poor that some wear blindfolds as part of their clothing. Their magical abilities are generally poor due to problems their unique mouth gives them when chanting magic spells. To make up for this, some Bangaa have developed exclusive high level spells for the race to use. They are also said to be distantly related to lizard men.|$|E

African (black sub-Saharan or North African) and Asian (East and South Asian) residents of Germany and black prisoners of war, {{such as the}} French colonial troops captured in the Battle of France, were also victims of Nazi racial policy. When the Nazis came to power hundreds of African-German children, the offspring of German mothers and African soldiers brought in during the French occupation, lived in the Rhineland. In Mein Kampf, Hitler described the children of marriages to African occupation troops as a contamination of the white race [...] "by Negro blood on the Rhine {{in the heart of}} Europe" [...] who were [...] "bastardising the European continent at its core". According to Hitler, [...] "Jews were responsible for bringing Negroes into the Rhineland, with the ultimate idea of bastardising the white race which <b>they</b> <b>hate</b> and thus lowering its cultural and political level so that the Jew might dominate".|$|E
500|$|Cyrus invited Brett Ratner, {{director}} of the [...] "7 Things" [...] music video, to her home {{to tell him how}} much the song meant to her and what it was about.

Cyrus said that neither she nor Ratner wanted the video to be [...] "all about [...] " [...] because the song's message was universal; [...] "almost every girl in America could say <b>they</b> <b>hate</b> their ex or current boyfriend," [...] claimed Cyrus. As a result, the video features numerous adolescent girls including actresses Nicola Peltz, Liana Liberato, and Maiara Walsh. During the planning session, Cyrus showed Ratner a collection of personal items her ex had given her, such as photographs and his dirty socks, which she had stowed away beneath her bed. They decided to include some of these items as props in the music video. For example, the necklace Cyrus wears in the video was her ex-boyfriend's medical identification tag, which he received because of his diabetes mellitus.|$|E

Mr. Krabs tells {{his side of}} the story, in a series of flashbacks. In the flashback, Mr. Krabs and Plankton were best friends from birth, and did {{everything}} together. One day, they get enough money to buy a burger from Stinky's Burgers, which, despite having horrible food and being located in a landfill, is very popular among the local children due to being the only place in town to get a burger. When Stinky refuses to give them a burger Plankton and Krabs decide to go into the burger business themselves, and create their own burger, but no one wants to try it. They then find out that the local health department closed Stinky's, so the two open [...] "Plabs Burgers" [...] at the dump, which the children are now forced to eat at, despite it being even worse than Stinky's. Plankton says that they are now ruling the children. Mr. Krabs argues that it should be about satisfying the customers, rather than power. Soon they get into an argument, and Krabs is ejected into a dump pile and tells Plankton that he will one day regret this.|$|E
500|$|Views in the U.S. press were mixed. In {{a review}} for The New York Times, current U.S. {{ambassador}} to the United Nations, Harvard scholar, and Pulitzer Prize winner Samantha Power described the book as a [...] "raging and often meandering assault" [...] on U.S. foreign policy. Believing that Chomsky divides the world into two camps, the oppressor and the oppressed, she asserts that in Hegemony or Survival he portrays the U.S. as [...] "the prime oppressor, [...] can do no right", meanwhile overlooking the crimes of the oppressed. Arguing that he completely ignores the concept that the U.S. might undertake any foreign interventions with good intentions, she asserts that his book {{is not easy to}} read, and that his [...] "glib and caustic tone" [...] are distracting. Furthermore, she highlights problems with his use of end notes, particularly when some of these notes simply reference his earlier publications. Although disagreeing with his arguments, she believed that reading his book was [...] "sobering and instructive", having value in illustrating how many non-Americans viewed the U.S. and highlighting many of the [...] "structural defects" [...] in U.S. foreign policy. Furthermore, recognizing that Chomsky's [...] "critiques have come to influence and reflect mainstream opinion elsewhere in the world," [...] she concedes that Chomksy's analysis has a coherence that, for many, resolves much of the post-9/11 confusion and disillusionment stemming from the Bush administration's standard response to the question, [...] "Why do <b>they</b> <b>hate</b> us?".|$|E
500|$|Academic Peter Hutchings, {{noting the}} many {{definitions}} of a cult film that require transgressive elements, states that cult films are known {{in part for}} their excesses. [...] Both subject matter and its depiction are portrayed in extreme ways that break taboos of good taste and aesthetic norms. [...] Violence, gore, sexual perversity, and even the music can be pushed to stylistic excess far beyond that allowed by mainstream cinema. Film censorship can make these films obscure and difficult to find, common criteria used to define cult films. [...] Despite this, these films remain well-known and prized among collectors. [...] Fans will occasionally express frustration with dismissive critics and conventional analysis, which they believe marginalizes and misinterprets paracinema. [...] In marketing these films, young men are predominantly targeted. [...] Horror films in particular can draw fans who seek the most extreme films. [...] Audiences can also ironically latch on to offensive themes, such as misogyny, using these films as catharsis {{for the things that}} <b>they</b> <b>hate</b> most in life. [...] Exploitative, transgressive elements can be pushed to excessive extremes for both humor and satire. Frank Henenlotter faced censorship and ridicule, but he found acceptance among audiences receptive to themes that Hollywood was reluctant to touch, such as violence, drug addiction, and misogyny. Lloyd Kaufman sees his films' political statements as more populist and authentic than the hypocrisy of mainstream films and celebrities. Despite featuring an abundance of fake blood, vomit, and diarrhea, Kaufman's films have attracted positive attention from critics and academics. [...] Excess can also exist as camp, such as films that highlight the excesses of 1980s fashion and commercialism.|$|E

500|$|The song is {{interpreted}} {{to be an}} ode to Noel and Liam Gallagher's mother Peggy. In general the lyrics of the song stress an optimistic outlook. Noel Gallagher explained that [...] "At the time [...] [...] [...] {{it was written in}} the middle of grunge and all that, and I remember Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate Myself and Want to Die', and I was like [...] [...] [...] 'Well, I'm not fucking having that.'

I can't have people like that coming over here, on smack, fucking saying that <b>they</b> <b>hate</b> themselves and they wanna die. That's fucking rubbish. Kids don't need to be hearing that nonsense." [...] While Gallagher has stated he did not intend [...] "Live Forever" [...] as a direct retort to Nirvana or their music (being a professed fan of the band), he contrasted the lives of Cobain and his band at that point, saying, [...] "Seems to me that here was a guy who had everything, and was miserable about it. And we had fuck-all, and I still thought that getting up in the morning was the greatest fuckin' thing ever, 'cause you didn't know where you'd end up at night. And we didn't have a pot to piss in, but it was fucking great, man". Gallagher considers the line [...] "We see things they'll never see" [...] the most important line of the song, explaining that old friends tend to laugh at jokes and stories that [...] "no one else gets".|$|E
500|$|Minh instead {{arrived to}} find that the {{brothers}} were not in the palace. In anticipation of a coup, they had ordered the construction of three separate tunnels leading from Gia Long to remote areas outside the palace. Around 20:00 {{on the night of the}} coup, with only the Presidential Guard to defend them against mutinous infantry and armor units, Diệm and Nhu hurriedly packed American banknotes into a briefcase. They escaped through one of the tunnels with two loyalists: Air Force Lieutenant Ðỗ Thơ, Diệm's aide-de-camp, who happened to be a nephew of Colonel Đỗ Mậu, the director of military security and a participant in the coup plot, and Xuân Vy, head of Nhu's Republican Youth. After the coup, General Paul Harkins, the head of the US presence in Vietnam, inspected the tunnel and noted that it [...] "was so far down that I didn't want to go down to walk up the thing". The brothers emerged in a wooded area in a park near the Cercle Sportif, the city's upper class sporting club, where they were picked up by a waiting Land Rover. Ellen Hammer disputes the tunnel escape, asserting that the Ngo brothers simply walked out of the building, which was not yet under siege. Hammer asserts that they walked past the tennis courts and left the palace grounds through a small gate at Le Thanh Ton Street and entered the car. The loyalists traveled through narrow back streets in order to evade rebel checkpoints and changed vehicles to a black Citroën sedan. After leaving the palace, Nhu was reported to have suggested to Diệm that the brothers split up, arguing that this would enhance their chances of survival. Nhu proposed that one of them travel to the Mekong Delta to join Cao's IV Corps, while the other would travel to the II Corps of General Nguyễn Khánh in the Central Highlands. Nhu felt the rebel generals would not dare to kill one of them while the other was free, in case the surviving brother were to regain power. According to one account, Diệm was reported to have turned down Nhu, reasoning that [...] "You cannot leave alone. <b>They</b> <b>hate</b> you too much; they will kill you. Stay with me and I will protect you." [...] Another story holds that Diệm said [...] "We have always been together during these last years. How could we separate during these last years? How could we separate in this critical hour?" [...] Nhu agreed to remain with his brother.|$|E
