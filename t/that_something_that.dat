25|$|As {{many modern}} thinkers will, Plato ascribes relativism to Protagoras and uses his predecessor's teachings as a foil {{for his own}} {{commitment}} to objective and transcendent realities and values. Plato ascribes to Protagoras an early form of what John Wild categorized as phenomenalism. That being an assertion <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is, or appears for a single individual, is true or real for that individual.|$|E
500|$|According to Barrales, {{beyond the}} name, Bonded by Blood {{borrowed}} from Exodus for inspiration everything. [...] "From the guitars being razor-sharp to the drums, the speed. We {{wanted to do}} something that resemble <b>that.</b> <b>Something</b> <b>that</b> is gonna be fast and in-your-face. And what better band than Exodus to be inspired by?" [...] Exodus' lead guitarist Gary Holt says that is a compliment that the band has named themselves after Bonded by Blood. [...] "Could I have imagined that all these years later a band was going to name themselves after our first album? Probably not. It is not like that convention—naming bands after songs—is something new, but I think it is great." ...|$|E
500|$|Mylod {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} filming the final {{scenes of the}} episode, the foot chase between Arya and the Waif, in the behind the scenes featurette published by HBO after the airing of the episode. Mylod stated that he did extensive research {{in order to create}} the foot chase, saying [...] "I devoured every foot chase in the history of cinema, but trying to take from <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> would fit into the blueprint of the Game of Thrones visual style, which is not necessarily the same kind of kinetic, handheld feel that you find in many contemporary thrillers. It's a much more classic frame." [...] He continued, [...] "Everything hinged from finding this very lovely, steep stairwell and thinking 'Wouldn't it be great if she leapt off that, and then tumbled down the stairs?' I had this image in my head that I wanted lots of oranges rolling down, not quite sure where that comes from, but it looked pretty." [...] Mylod also stated in a separate interview that it was a conscious decision not to show the final fight between Arya and the Waif, given that it took place in the dark, noting [...] "when the character dies in the dark, unless we switch on night-vision goggles, we're {{not going to be able}} to see that, and we're not going to stick around to hear a scream in the dark anyway. It was actually a conscious choice in the writing and I think, for me, a very elegant storytelling beat as to get that reveal a few seconds later." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{programme}} {{was originally}} conceived in 1998, when screenwriters Matthew Graham and Ashley Pharoah were sent on {{a break to}} the English seaside resort of Blackpool by Kudos Film & Television to think up programme ideas. Originally titled Ford Granada after the 1970s car, the series {{was rejected by the}} BBC. In response, Graham stated: [...] "Back then, broadcasters just weren't comfortable with something like <b>that,</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> wasn't set in the real world and that had a fantasy element to it." [...] According to Graham, the initial idea was for a humorous, pre-watershed programme that overtly mocked the styles and attitudes of the 1970s, with the comic actor Neil Morrissey envisaged as the central character.|$|E
2500|$|Johanan ben Saul {{asked why}} [...] {{required}} {{that they should}} bring a calf ( [...] , eglah) into a ravine. Johanan ben Saul explained that God provided <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> had not borne fruit would have its neck broken {{in a place that}} was not fertile to atone for one who would {{no longer be able to}} produce fruit. The Gemara asked then what the word [...] "fruit" [...] meant in the context of the murder victim, for if one interpreted it to mean [...] "children," [...] then according to that argument, the ceremony would not apply if the murder victim had been old or castrated. Therefore, the Gemara concluded, one must understand [...] "fruit" [...] to mean the performance of commandments (that the murdered person would no longer be able to fulfill)..|$|E

In fact it would be possible for the two captains to agree a value of G50 before the start of each match, taking account of all relevant factors. However, we do not believe <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is only invoked if rain interferes with the game should impose itself on every game in this way.

2500|$|In Plato one {{experienced}} unit is a state, or object existing, {{which can}} be observed. The time parameter is set at [...] "ever"; that is, the state is to be presumed present between observations. Change is to be deduced by comparing observations and is thus presumed a function that happens to objects already in being, rather than something ontologically essential to them (such <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> does not change cannot exist) as in Heraclitus. In Plato, {{no matter how many}} of those experienced units you are able to tally, you cannot get through the mysterious gap between them to account for the change that must be occurring there. This limitation is considered a fundamental limitation of reality by Plato and in part underpins his differentiation between imperfect experience from more perfect Forms. The fact that this is no limitation for Heraclitus motivates Plato's condemnation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} these decisions, the Second Circuit had ruled {{in this case that}} the {{religious}} nature of the Good News Club's message meant that it [...] "fell outside the bounds of" [...] speech related to [...] "pure moral and character development", and hence was not entitled to First Amendment protection. [...] The majority on the Supreme Court [...] "disagreed <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is 'quintessentially religious' or 'decidedly religious in nature' cannot also be characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development from a particular viewpoint. [...] What matters for purposes of the Free Speech Clause is that we can see no logical difference in kind between the invocation of Christianity by the Club and the invocation of teamwork, loyalty, or patriotism by other associations to provide a foundation for their lessons." [...] Instruction related to morals and values from a religious perspective does not somehow [...] "taint" [...] that instruction so as to alter the viewpoint such instruction takes. [...] Accordingly, Milford's exclusion of the Good News Club constituted unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} year, {{a different}} {{judge of the}} High Court departed from the view taken in Tang Kin Hwa. In Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni (2006), Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon definitively answering the question left open by Phang {{as to whether the}} two tests for apparent bias were the same. He thought that there was a real difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In his opinion, [...] "suspicion" [...] suggests a belief <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> may not be provable could still be possible. [...] "Reasonable" [...] suggests that the belief cannot be fanciful. Here the issue is whether it is reasonable for the one to harbour the suspicions in the circumstances even though the suspicious behaviour could be innocent. On the other hand, [...] "likelihood" [...] points towards something being likely, and [...] "real" [...] suggests that this must be substantial rather than imagined. Here, then, the inquiry is directed more towards the actor than the observer. The issue {{is the degree to which}} a particular event is not likely or possible.|$|E
2500|$|In {{reference}} to Gore's alleged conflict of interest, {{some critics have}} labeled Gore a [...] "carbon billionaire." [...] In response to these criticisms Gore stated that it is “certainly not true” {{that he is a}} “carbon billionaire” and that he is [...] "proud to put my money where my mouth is for the past 30 years. And though that is not the majority of my business activities, I absolutely believe in investing in accordance with my beliefs and my values." [...] Gore was challenged on this topic by Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn who asked him: [...] "The legislation that we are discussing here today, is <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> you are going to personally benefit from?” Gore responded by stating: [...] "I believe that the transition to a green economy is good for our economy and good for all of us, and I have invested in it." [...] Gore also added that all earnings from his investments have gone to the Alliance for Climate Protection and that [...] "If you believe that the reason I have been working on this issue for 30 years is because of greed, you don’t know me." [...] Finally, Gore told Blackburn: [...] "Do you think {{there is something wrong with}} being active in business in this country [...] I am proud of it. I am proud of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, in Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni (2006), Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon {{thought that}} there was a real {{difference}} between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In his opinion, suspicion suggests a belief <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> may not be provable could still be possible. Reasonable suggests that the belief cannot be fanciful. Here the issue is whether it is reasonable for the one to harbour the suspicions in the circumstances even though the suspicious behaviour could be innocent. On the other hand, likelihood points towards something being likely, and real suggests that this must be substantial rather than imagined. Here, then, the inquiry is directed more towards the actor than the observer. The issue {{is the degree to which}} a particular event is not likely or possible. Menon J.C. also disagreed with both Lord Goff in Gough and Phang J.C. in Tang Kin Hwa in that he thought the shift of the inquiry from how the matter might appear to a reasonable man to whether the judge thinks there is a sufficient possibility of bias was [...] "a very significant point of departure". The real likelihood test is met as long as the court is satisfied that there is a sufficient degree of possibility of bias. Although this a lower standard than satisfaction on a balance of probabilities, this is actually directed at mitigating the sheer difficulty of proving actual bias, especially given its insidious and often subconscious nature. The reasonable suspicion test, however, is met if the court is satisfied that a reasonable member of the public could harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias even though the court itself thought there was no real danger of this on the facts. The difference is that the driver behind this test is the strong public interest in ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice. As of September 2011, the Court of Appeal of Singapore had not yet expressed a view as to whether the position taken in Tang Kin Hwa or Shankar Alan is preferable.|$|E
