A member of your family will be able <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> about your duty to God. Remember, this achievement is part of your Cub Scout promise. [...] "I, ____, promise {{to do my best}} to do my duty to God and my country." ...|$|E
60|$|DR. JONATHAN. I'm {{not dealing}} with superstition, Asher, but with science. If George revives, he will wish <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, Mr Rokesmith, don't be {{hard with}} me, don't be stern with me; be magnanimous! I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> on equal terms.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Scarcely that," [...] she replied, [...] "only, you see, {{it seemed}} {{waste of time}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> the foils on, and a little dangerous, perhaps, <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> them off." ...|$|R
60|$|HILLMAN (glancing at DR. JONATHAN). There's {{a matter}} we'd like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Mr. Pindar, {{as soon as}} convenient.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{the very}} thing I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Ben, for I meditate a long journey immediately. Come, walk with me." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was content}} {{just to see}} you and <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and to know you were here, near me. You've made me {{extraordinarily}} happy.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you ain't {{very busy}} I'd like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> 'bout somethin' that's botherin' my pardner an' {{me a good}} bit since last night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That doesn't {{interest}} me, especially, sir," [...] answered Kenneth, smiling. [...] "I'm not electioneering just now. I've come <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> {{about young}} Gates." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'This is Mr. Hawtrey, Mr. Slippen,' said Ned, as they {{followed}} him into his room; 'he thought he would like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over <b>with</b> <b>you</b> the plan of campaign.' ...|$|R
60|$|AUGUSTA. Asher, I'd like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> Minnie, if <b>you</b> don't mind.|$|R
6000|$|He hesitated, {{and went}} off at a tangent. [...] "There's no end of things I'd like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> It's just upon my lunch-time. Come and have lunch with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How lucky!" [...] remarked Colonel Parsons naively, when James had gone. [...] "We wanted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> privately, William. You're {{a man of}} the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm goin' to Williamsburg; {{but wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> fellers first, so {{come up here}} where I could see if you was in Ninety-four's house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Too much so," [...] said Mrs. Durgin. [...] "I {{should like}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> about Jeff, Mr. Westover; you and him was always such friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] said Mr. Spillikins, [...] "you're so awfully sympathetic. It {{makes it}} so easy <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> <b>With</b> other girls, {{especially}} with clever ones, even with Dulphemia. I often feel a perfect jackass beside them. But I don t feel that way <b>with</b> <b>you</b> at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly, William," [...] said I, [...] "for aught I know, {{that may}} be true; what, then, shall we do next?" [...] Says he, [...] "Thou hast but two things to do: either {{to go in and}} take all the rest, or else get thee gone before they come out and take thee; for I see they are {{hoisting}} a topmast to yon great ship, in order to put to sea immediately, and they won't be long before they come <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>thee,</b> and what wilt thou say to them when they ask thee why thou borrowedst their ship without leave?" ...|$|R
60|$|G. (Wearily.) Poor old Jack? I don't {{think you}} need. Isn't {{it time for}} The Butcha to have his nap? Bring a chair out here, dear. I've got {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over <b>with</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Won't {{you talk}} {{with him when he}} comes? He is not ignorant and dull, like us, and he would so like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> Will you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I've promised, Jim, and you wouldn't make me out a liar. She does {{but want}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> {{for it is}} a lonely life she leads." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{the fault}} is, being disorderly at prayer time. Now {{if you like}} frank and open dealing, {{and are willing to}} deal so with me, I should like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> a little about it, but if you are not willing, I will dismiss the subject. I do not wish <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> now about it, unless you {{yourself}} desire it. But if we talk at all, we must both be open, and honest, and sincere. Now should you rather have me talk with you or not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My father's son {{can best}} judge of that, old man. I have {{business}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and <b>with</b> my fair St. Catharine here, the loveliest and most obdurate saint in the calendar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My {{mother said}} to me not <b>to</b> be <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> to-day or to-morrow or on Sunday. It was a bad time she took for telling me that, it was {{shutting}} the door after the house was robbed....|$|R
6000|$|... "Pleased to meet you," [...] {{said the}} American. [...] "I've got some very {{important}} business I'd like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> if I can see you alone." [...] He looked pointedly at the other.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have come}} to you now, Checco, impelled by a very strong sense of duty, and I wish <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> on {{a matter of the}} {{greatest}} importance.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{sit beside}} me, and I'll tell you, sir; that is, {{if you please}} I should love <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> for it's lonely here when Bess is gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{just wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> about it. But I thought maybe you'd like to go. Or at least I should. I {{should like to}} go home, Mrs. Landa." ...|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. (Wearily.) Poor old Jack? I don't {{think you}} need. Isn't {{it time for}} The Butcha to have his nap? Bring a chair out here, dear. I've got some thing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over <b>with</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will be able}} to {{give them}} a {{superior}} kind of society to what they have had access to here. There is a good deal that I should like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over <b>with</b> <b>you</b> before they come in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now suppose I call a sixth boy, {{and say to}} him, I {{have set}} four or five boys to work, copying this piece of poetry; now I want you to set down {{and see if you}} cannot do it better than any of them. No one of them knows that any other is writing, except you, but after the others are all done, I will compare them and see if yours is not the best.' This would be trying to excite emulation. We must call this boy then, E.--But the time I {{intended}} <b>to</b> devote <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> on this subject for to-day, is expired. Perhaps, to-morrow, I will take up the subject again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, if {{you want}} to. I don't know but you betta; we might as well; I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> Don't you think it's {{something}} we ought to talk about-sensibly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> She's out, with Lottie; {{and when}} she comes back I will tell her what you say. But I {{want to know what}} you think, first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some day," [...] she said, [...] "not in the {{restaurant}} here but when we are alone and have time, I should so much like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> on really serious matters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pinkerton, I {{should like}} <b>to</b> have a <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and Easton {{and two or}} three others--Skinner, and Mossop, and Templer--yes, and Scudamore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bacri," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, [...] "may I venture to {{interrupt}} your present agreeable occupation? I wish <b>to</b> have a <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> in private." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Billow is out, and I want <b>to</b> {{have some}} <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> alone, Mr. Billow," [...] she said quietly, sitting down {{opposite}} {{to the old}} man.|$|R
