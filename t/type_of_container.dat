This new variant has a cargo loading system capable of handling virtually every <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>container</b> and pallet, and a side door {{at the rear of}} the lower deck capable of handling large items of general freight. The airline took its first delivery of this new aircraft in September 2004, with the eighth and final aircraft delivered on 22 June 2006. The new freighters were powered by two General Electric (GE) CF6-80C2 engines and signed a 14-year Maintenance Cost Per Hour (MCPH) programme with GE on 25 January 2005.|$|E
25|$|Pet crickets spend {{winters in}} a {{different}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>container</b> made of a gourd (the hard-shelled fruit of Lagenaria vulgaris). The bottoms of the gourds are filled with lime mortar. The carved lids can be made of jade, coconut shell, sandalwood and ivory; the most common motif employs an ornament of gourd vines, flowers, and fruits. The thickness of the lid and the configuration of vents in it are tailored to enhance the tone of a cricket's song. The ancient art of growing molded gourds was lost during the Cultural Revolution, when the old pastime was deemed inappropriate for Red China. 20th-century cricket enthusiasts like Wang Shixiang had to carve their gourds themselves. Contemporary cricket gourds have carved, rather than naturally molded, surfaces. Molded gourds are being slowly re-introduced since the 1990s by enthusiasts like Zhang Cairi.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} conceptual diversity in the seat of emotions via a corpus-based case study of diachronic variation in the metaphorical <b>containers</b> <b>of</b> sadness in English. Data sourced from Literature Online, Early English Books Online and the British National Corpus reveal three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> metaphorical <b>containers</b> <b>of</b> sadness: (1) the human body in general and whatever is either literally internal to it, or at least often conceptualized as such, such as {{the heart and the}} soul; (2) external body parts and different kinds of superficial body features, such as the eyes and the voice; and (3) containers that are not inherently connected with the human body, such as a room and a sonnet. A comparison between the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> metaphorical <b>containers</b> in different periods shows that whereas the percentage <b>of</b> the third <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> remains constant by and large, there has been a noticeable increase in the percentage <b>of</b> the second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> and a quite obvious decrease in the percentage <b>of</b> the first <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers.</b> It is argued that the diachronic variation in the relative frequencies <b>of</b> the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> may have been related to a shift in the general conception of body and emotions, and specifically to the gradual disintegration of humoral theory. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

2500|$|Ceramic jars or pots {{with flat}} lids, {{introduced}} in the Ming period, are the preferred <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>container</b> for keeping the cricket in summer. Some jars are shaped as a gourd but most are cylindrical. Thick clay walls effectively shield the cricket from excessive heat. Ceramic pots are used for raising cricket larvae until the insect matures to the point when it can be safely transported in a cage or a gourd. The bottom of the jar is filled with a mortar made of clay, lime, and sand. It is levelled at a slant angle of about thirty degrees, smoothed, and dried into a shiny solid mass. In addition to shaping the cricket's habitat, it also defines the acoustic properties of a cricket house. Inside, the jar may contain a cricket [...] "bed" [...] or [...] "sleeping box" [...] (lingfan) made of clay, wood, or ivory, and miniature porcelain [...] "dishes".|$|E

All demands <b>of</b> all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> must be met by the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers,</b> i.e., substitutions between container types are not included. Container demand cannot be postponed. The model does not consider returning-leased containers to the lessor. It is assumed that a lease term does not expire in the planning horizon. When demand cannot be met (yielding a shortage in the system), containers can be provided by other partners or from external sources (emergency shipments), but at a high cost.|$|R
