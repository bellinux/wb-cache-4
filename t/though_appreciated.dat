50|$|In 1958, Shanta Gandhi {{was called}} to Delhi as Asian Theatre Institute was being set up, she joined a Professor of Ancient Indian Drama, in the {{following}} year when it merged with the National School of Drama, she continued teaching and in the coming years revived ancient Indian plays starting with Sanskrit drama masters, Kalidasa, Bhasa, Vishakhadatta and Bhavabhuti. She was first to revive 4th century BC, Sanskrit playwright, Bhasa's through her productions of Madhyamavyayoga (1966) (The Middle One) and Urubhanga (The Broken Thigh), a decade before Pannikar and Ratan Thiyam began working with them. She later directed Vishakhadatta's Mudrarakshasa, Virkam Varman's Bhagavadajjukam (1967) all in Hindi. In 1967, she wrote Jasma Odan in Gujarati based on a folk tale, subsequently she translated it in Malavi Hindi with Dr. Shyam Parmar, the result was her most noted production of the Bhavai-based musical Jasma Odhan in 1968, with NSD Repertory Company featuring actors like Manohar Singh and Uttara Baokar. She also did the design for the play, and it resurrected the Bhavai folk theatre from Gujarat. Jasma Odhan remains an integral part of Bhavai repertoire to date and ran successfully in cities like Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Delhi for many years and was also performed in London, Poland and GDR. It was later revived by Nadira Babbar's group Ek jute, which is now performing it for several years now. She also wrote historical play, Razia Sultan which was quite popular and used Nautanki folk theatre style from Uttar Pradesh which choreographing her production, Amar Singh Rathor, which also wrote. She revived interest in Jaishankar Prasad's plays, which <b>though</b> <b>appreciated</b> of literary content were deemed un-stagable by scholars, by successfully staging his 1928 historical play Skanda Gupta, with little changes to the original script. She remained its Chairperson of, 1982-1984. She also remained Director, Bal Bhavan, Delhi and National Children's Museum.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aim: The {{incidence}} of bronchial asthma is on increase. Chemotherapy is helpful during early {{course of the}} disease, but later on morbidity and mortality increases. The efficacy of yoga therapy <b>though</b> <b>appreciated</b> {{is yet to be}} defined and modified. Aim: To study the effect of breathing exercises (pranayama) in patients with bronchial asthma of mild to moderate severity. Materials and Methods: Fifty cases of bronchial asthma (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV 1) > 70 &#x 0025;) were studied for 12 weeks. Patients were allocated to two groups: group A and group B (control group). Patients in group A were treated with breathing exercises (deep breathing, Brahmari, and Omkara, etc.) for 20 minutes twice daily for a period of 12 weeks. Patients were trained to perform Omkara at high pitch (forceful) with prolonged exhalation as compared to normal Omkara. Group B was treated with meditation for 20 minutes twice daily for a period of 12 weeks. Subjective assessment, FEV 1 &#x 0025;, and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) were done in each case initially and after 12 weeks. Results: After 12 weeks, group A subjects had significant improvement in symptoms, FEV 1, and PEFR as compared to group B subjects. Conclusion: Breathing exercises (pranayama), mainly expiratory exercises, improved lung function subjectively and objectively and should be regular part of therapy...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{computer}} science within health organisations {{is more and}} more important, so that health information systems represent {{one of the most interesting}} areas in the evolution of health management (we may think of the certification projects of the information technology competences in health systems, that have been recently started by the ECDL Foundation in Europe and AICA in Italy). Obviously, in this direction a fundamental role (even <b>though</b> <b>appreciated</b> not yet completely in the contribution to value creation) is played by New Technologies, i. e. those automatic solutions, that are prevailingly based on ICT (Information and Communication Technology) infrastructures. Among these ones, in health organisation call centres have had an immediate and tangible success: they are useful for different services (we may think of the departments for the relationships with customers), but they are prevailingly oriented to the reservation activity. Anyway, also in this case human resources play an essential role, because, obviously, the “automation” relies in the contact channel, but not in the service relationship (between health organisation and patients/clients). This work aims to show the methodology of a case study (the reservation department for health services of “Casa di Cura Tortorella s. p. a. ”, Salerno – Italy), in which the front office personnel has been interested by a training intervention, in order to improve the service quality. By monitoring the activities (to handle in a more efficient way the waiting lists) and by checking the possible inconsistencies between prescriptions and reserved exams (thanks to punctual interviews with internal services and prescribing physicians), it has been possible to determine some improvement margins, to be pursued by a training programme (for the front office personnel) on healthcare culture and, in particular, on topographic anatomy. The research objective, in the perspective to the improvement of health services quality, is to study how to gain an increase of efficacy and efficiency for the reservation department, after deploying an adequate analysis on knowledge needs and a suitable training intervention on health exams’ terminology: such a step is preliminary to a better customer satisfaction (other than an improvement of corporate image and relationship with prescribing physicians); while the research aim is the verification of the general conviction, according to which the quality increase in health services can not depend only on the mere introduction of New Technologies in the organisations, but on a coherent investment in competences, which are necessary to manage these new solutions (otherwise, they would represent only a cost, and not an investment) ...|$|E
