The two then prepare <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> the night.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{time was}} {{on the side of}} the defenders; most armies could not afford <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> the {{prosecution}} of a siege, especially of a well-fortified, well-provisioned city. Until the invention of gunpowder-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the balance of power and logistics definitely favored the defender. With the introduction of large-caliber mortars and howitzers (in modern times), the traditional methods of defense became less effective against a determined siege, although many of the trace italienne fortresses presented a formidable challenge well into the twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|Although Portuguese by birth, Ferdinand Magellan {{transferred}} his {{allegiance to}} King Charles I of Spain, on whose behalf he left Seville on 10 August 1519, with {{a squadron of}} five ships, {{in search of a}} western route to the Spice Islands in the East Indies. Success depended on finding a strait or passage through the South American land masses, or finding the southern tip of the continent and sailing around it. The South American coast was sighted on 6 December 1519, and Magellan moved cautiously southward, following the coast to reach latitude 49°S on 31 March 1520. Little if anything was known of the coast south of this point, so Magellan decided <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> the southern winter here, and established the settlement of Puerto San Julian.|$|E
5|$|The initial Abbasid {{invasion}} {{was led by}} Ishaq ibn Kundaj, {{appointed as}} the nominal governor of Syria and Egypt, and another general, Muhammad ibn Diwdad Abu'l-Saj. After receiving encouragement from al-Muwaffaq, who promised to send them reinforcements, the two commanders marched into Syria in mid-884. The Tulunid governor of Damascus soon defected to their side, {{and they were able}} to take control of Antioch, Hims and Aleppo. Upon learning of the Abbasid advance, Khumarawayh sent troops to Syria. The Tulunid army first proceeded to Damascus, where they succeeded in forcing its rebel governor to flee, and then advanced to Shayzar on the Orontes. The onset of winter, however, resulted in a lull in hostilities, and both sides remained in their camps <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> the season.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{days out}} of Delaware Bay, Bonnet entered the estuary of the Cape Fear River and {{anchored}} {{near the mouth of}} a small waterway now known as Bonnet's Creek. The Royal James had begun to leak badly and was in need of careening. Shortly afterwards, a small shallop entered the river and was captured. Bonnet had the shallop broken up to help repair the Royal James. The work of careening was done, in whole or in part, by the prisoners Bonnet had captured. Bonnet threatened at least one man with marooning if he did not work with the slaves to repair the Royal James. Bonnet remained in the Cape Fear River for the next 45 days. According to Bonnet's boatswain, Ignatius Pell, the pirates intended <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> the hurricane season there.|$|E

She was determined <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> the thief, maintaining that he could starve or surrender. The thief dug a tunnel and escaped, however, and the hermit who took care of the church broke his vow of silence to scold her for attempting to harm someone who had sought sanctuary.

25|$|The Allies {{stood still}} between March 4 and 6, {{tracking}} the French manoeuvres {{and trying to}} discern Masséna's intentions with certainty. To Wellington the apparent French retreat was itself a welcome relief, and the general opted <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> events rather than risk compromising his advantage with precipitous actions against the enemy (nor was Wellington eager to try conclusions with a commander as reputed as Masséna, even an apparently beaten Masséna, unless it were on his own terms). Unbeknownst to the French, however, several Allied detachments (largely Portuguese recruits) had already seized many positions along the Mondego. Consequently, the Allies did not march until {{the morning of the}} 6th, with Wellington directing a circumspect and cautious pursuit of Ney.|$|E

However, the pair leaked runs during the first eight overs, and the score was 51 for 0 when Baisya ran in to bowl his fifth over of the day and Bangladesh's ninth. However, Sanath Jayasuriya was bowled by an inswinging delivery from Baisya for 25, and that slowed Sri Lanka down. Baisya even bowled a maiden over as the Sri Lankans chose <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> the middle overs and set the platform for big hitting at the end - which worked perfectly.|$|E

25|$|The next day, Balao {{investigated}} smoke on the horizon, {{found two}} cargo ships, tracked {{them through a}} rain squall, and as she passed into clear weather, found the convoy in perfect position for her torpedoes. She fired four stern tubes at the leading ship, but heard no explosions. The torpedoes were duds or had again passed underneath. As the escorts actively pursued the submarine, Balao submerged <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> the inevitable depth charges. When the submarine surfaced again, all trace of the convoy was gone, and she set course for Langemak Bay, New Guinea, with all her torpedoes expended. On 7 March, Balao moored alongside Coucal and took on fuel and provisions. She got underway again on the following morning, bound for Pearl Harbor where she arrived for refit on 19 March.|$|E
