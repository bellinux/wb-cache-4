5|$|I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, {{could you}} tell me {{something}} about your mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over <b>the</b> <b>stove,</b> trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E
5|$|Spilled hot {{cooking oil}} {{can also cause}} severe third degree burns, In the {{worst-case}} scenario, severe burns can be fatal. The higher temperatures and tendency of oil {{to stick to the}} skin make spilled hot cooking oil far more dangerous than spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their hands on top of <b>the</b> <b>stove,</b> playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technology}} of <b>the</b> clean cook <b>stove</b> {{has been dubbed}} <b>the</b> rocket <b>stove</b> because of <b>the</b> simple yet effective design. <b>The</b> cook <b>stove</b> has a large vertical cylinder that holds a pot and an opening at the bottom to feed the combustible biomass to cook a meal or pasteurize drinking water. In {{the next five years}} <b>the</b> clean <b>stoves</b> could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 400,000 tons and prevent more than 85,000 kilograms of black carbon from entering the atmosphere. The combustion chamber of <b>the</b> Envirofit <b>stoves</b> use up to 60% less fuel than other stoves or open fires to reduce toxic emissions by up to 80%. [...] There are several types of clean stoves produced by Envirofit International including <b>the</b> CH-4400 charcoal <b>stove,</b> <b>the</b> CH-5200 charcoal <b>stove,</b> <b>the</b> CH-2200 charcoal <b>stove,</b> <b>the</b> Z-3000 Built-In wood <b>stove,</b> <b>the</b> G-3300 wood <b>stove,</b> and <b>the</b> M-500.|$|R

60|$|After {{they came}} in from their walk, they asked the landlady to have a fire made in their room; but she {{said they could not}} have any fire, for <b>the</b> <b>stoves</b> were not put up. She said it was the custom in Holland not to put <b>the</b> <b>stoves</b> up until October; and so nobody could have a fire in any thing but foot stoves until that time. <b>The</b> foot <b>stoves,</b> she said, would make it very {{comfortable}} for them.|$|R
5|$|Strong winds {{prevented}} Mawson {{from continuing}} for two days. Instead, he prepared for travelling alone, removing the rearmost half from the sledge, and rearranging its cargo. To save having to carry excess kerosene for <b>the</b> <b>stove,</b> he boiled {{the remainder of}} the dog meat. Dragging Mertz's body in the sleeping bag from the tent, Mawson constructed a rough cairn from snow blocks to cover it, and used two spare beams from the sledge to form a cross, which he placed on the top. The following day he read the burial service.|$|E
5|$|The tuyeres {{are used}} to {{implement}} a hot blast, {{which is used to}} increase the efficiency of the blast furnace. The hot blast is directed into the furnace through water-cooled copper nozzles called tuyeres near the base. The hot blast temperature can be from 900°C to 1300°C (1600°F to 2300°F) depending on <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> design and condition. The temperatures they deal with may be 2000°C to 2300°C (3600°F to 4200°F). Oil, tar, natural gas, powdered coal and oxygen can also be injected into the furnace at tuyere level to combine with the coke to release additional energy and increase the percentage of reducing gases present which is necessary to increase productivity.|$|E
5|$|Leslie takes {{possession}} of the jinniyah and asks for his brother {{to be returned to}} life. Anson is returned, but in a decaying state, complete with injuries from the crash. Leslie's second wish is for Anson to talk, which results in Anson screaming {{at the top of his}} lungs and telling his brother that he is cold. Back at the morgue, Scully finds the body has disappeared and Mulder suspects it is because of Leslie's wish. They go to the Stokes residence and Anson blows the house up trying to light <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> in an attempt to warm up. Mulder questions Jenn, the jinniyah, who says she's 500 years old. According to her, she gained her powers after wishing for great power and long life from another genie. She also says that Mulder unrolled her so he now has three wishes of his own. Mulder wishes for peace on earth and she wipes out the entire human population. With his second wish, Mulder undoes his first wish. Mulder then writes down his third wish to be very specific. However, just before making the final wish, Scully helps Mulder realize that the power of a genie should not be used to force people to be good, and so he ultimately wishes for Jenn to be free.|$|E

5|$|With {{all of the}} {{evidence}} of the Bay Harbor Butcher murders pointing to Doakes as the killer, the case is closed. Forensic investigator Vince Masuka (C. S. Lee) tells Dexter the gas in the cabin was turned on while <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> was lit, and when Dexter sees his own satellite navigation system while cataloging evidence, he realizes that Lila must have found the cabin. He meets with her at the aquarium and tells her that he, like her, has no emotion and lives a life devoid of feeling. They form plans to leave Miami together, though Dexter secretly intends to kill her. When he visits her apartment the next day, though, he finds Debra there, trying to persuade Lila to leave town. Dexter is forced to lie about running away with Lila in front of Debra, so a hurt Lila then leaves with what she recognizes as Dexter's bag of murder equipment. She goes to Rita's house and drugs the babysitter so that she can abduct the children, Astor and Cody (Christina Robinson and Preston Bailey). When Dexter realizes that Astor and Cody are missing, he goes straight to Lila's apartment, where she lights another fire and locks the three of them inside. Rita calls Debra for her help, and Debra decides to skip her flight to Oregon with Lundy to help with finding the children. Dexter manages to free Astor and Cody through a small window and eventually rams down a thin wall allowing him to escape.|$|E

25|$|The Franklin Stove, {{also known}} as the {{circulating}} stove, is a metal-lined fireplace with baffles in the rear to improve the airflow, providing more heat and less smoke than an ordinary open fireplace. <b>The</b> <b>stove</b> became very popular throughout the Thirteen Colonies and gradually replaced open fireplaces. The Franklin stove was invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1742.|$|E
25|$|The Last Day of the Twelfth Moon; on {{this holiday}} ale and fruit were {{provided}} as offerings to {{the god of}} <b>the</b> <b>stove,</b> after having Buddhist or Taoist priests recite scripture at one's own home (if one had the wealth and means). Offerings were made to <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> god because it was his responsibility to make annual reports to heaven on the good deeds or sins committed by the family in question. A family would do everything to charm the god, including hanging a newly painted portrait of the god {{on a piece of}} paper above their stove on New Years, which hung in the same position for an entire year. It was a common practice to rub in some alcoholic beverage across the picture of the deities mouth, so that he would become drunk and far too inebriated to make any sort of reasonably bad or negative report about the family to heaven.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe biomass stoves {{have been}} applied {{thousands}} of years in Chinese rural areas, while the thermal efficiency of <b>the</b> traditional biomass <b>stove</b> is low and redundant heat is utilized inadequately. In this paper, <b>the</b> multifunctional biomass <b>stove</b> which has <b>the</b> heat collector inside was designed and transformed based on the structure analysis of <b>the</b> traditional biomass <b>stoves.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> related performance indicators were proposed, which are applicable for <b>the</b> multifunctional biomass <b>stove.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> multifunctional biomass <b>stove</b> was compared with <b>the</b> traditional biomass <b>stove</b> in <b>the</b> thermal performance by testing. The results which were obtained by synthesizing the performance indicators showed that the thermal efficiency of <b>the</b> multifunctional biomass <b>stove</b> was 30. 79 % higher than <b>the</b> traditional biomass <b>stove</b> based on <b>the</b> kang surface temperature. <b>The</b> multifunctional biomass <b>stove</b> had a preferable thermal performance than <b>the</b> traditional biomass <b>stove.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> multifunctional biomass <b>stove</b> can reduce <b>the</b> energy consumption and is applicable in rural buildings...|$|R

However, it was unclear which color the smoke was for over an hour; some of the {{cardinals}} had personally deposited their notes and tally sheets in <b>the</b> <b>stove,</b> causing black smoke after white had already appeared. Pericle Felici, as the ranking Cardinal Deacon, then stepped onto the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica and delivered the Habemus Papam announcement in Latin, declaring Luciani's election.

5000|$|Canadian {{inventor}} Thomas Ahearn filed patent number no. 39916 in 1892 for an [...] "Electric Oven," [...] {{a device}} he probably employed in preparing a meal for an Ottawa hotel that year. Ahearn and Warren Y. Soper were owners of Ottawa's Chaudiere Electric Light and Power Company. <b>The</b> electric <b>stove</b> was showcased at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, where an electrified model kitchen was shown. Unlike <b>the</b> gas <b>stove,</b> <b>the</b> electrical <b>stove</b> {{was slow to}} catch on, {{partly due to the}} unfamiliar technology, and the need for cities and towns to be electrified. By the 1930s, the technology had matured and <b>the</b> electrical <b>stove</b> slowly began to replace <b>the</b> gas <b>stove,</b> especially in household kitchens.|$|R

25|$|Over {{the course}} of a season {{creosote}} deposits can become several inches thick. This creates a compounding problem, because the creosote deposits reduce the draft (airflow through the chimney) which increases the probability that the wood fire is not getting enough air for complete combustion. Since creosote is highly combustible, a thick accumulation creates a fire hazard. If a hot fire is built in <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> or fireplace, and the air control left wide open, this may allow hot oxygen into the chimney where it comes in contact with the creosote which then ignites—causing a chimney fire. Chimney fires often spread to the main building because the chimney gets so hot that it ignites any combustible material in direct contact with it, such as wood. The fire can also spread to the main building from sparks emitting from the chimney and landing on combustible roof surfaces. In order to properly maintain chimneys and heaters that burn wood or carbon-based fuels, the creosote buildup must be removed. Chimney sweeps perform this service for a fee.|$|E
25|$|The Lincoln Park Conservatory offers year-round {{displays}} of plants {{from many different}} climates around the world. Today's conservatory was built in stages from 1890 to 1895. It consists of a vestibule, four display halls and fifteen propagating and growing houses. The vestibule and Palm House were built and {{opened to the public}} in 1892 and contain giant palms and rubber trees, including a 15m (50ft) fiddle-leaf rubber tree planted in 1891. In the Palm House, one can also find Garden Figure, a sculpture by Frederick Hibbard. The Fern Room or Fernery was opened in 1895. It contains plants of the forest floor, primarily a vast collection of ferns. The Tropical Room was originally called <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> house. Opened in 1895, it contained an assortment of tropical plants suspended from bark-covered walls. It is now called the Orchid Room and has a collection of approximately 25,000 natural species. The Display House is used for seasonal flower and plant exhibits. A docent program run by the Chicago Park District and Lincoln Park Conservancy provides free tours of the Conservatory and its outdoor gardens from 1-4 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays and from 9 to Noon on Saturdays.|$|E
