5|$|The Bearcats {{opened the}} 2008 college {{football}} season against , winning 40–7 in an offensive effort led by senior quarterback Dustin Grutza, {{who was named}} the team's starter at that position following Mauk's dismissal. For its second game of the season, Cincinnati traveled to Norman, Oklahoma, to face the Oklahoma Sooners for the first time. In a 52–26 loss <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> that would play for the national championship that season, Grutza broke his ankle {{and was replaced by}} junior Tony Pike.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{injuries}} throughout his later years, Thome totaled, according to Fangraphs, 71.6 Wins Above Replacement (WAR), a sabermetrics baseball statistic intended to quantify a player's total contributions <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>team.</b> He {{was one of}} few players whose prime was during the steroid era and was not suspected of using steroids; Thome adamantly denies ever using performance-enhancing drugs. Soon after the announcement of his front office position (which signified {{the end of his}} playing career), writers began to speculate {{as to whether or not}} Thome would make it to the Baseball Hall of Fame, and more specifically, whether he would gain entrance in his first year of eligibility in 2018. Writers also questioned whether Thome's candidacy would be hindered by his lack of self-promotion and others' tendency to overlook him.|$|E
5|$|From the league's {{founding}} in 1920 until 1932, {{there was no}} scheduled championship game. From 1920–1923, the championship was awarded <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> {{by a vote of}} team owners at the annual owners' meeting. From 1924–1932, the team having the best winning percentage was awarded the championship. As each team played a different number of games, simply counting wins and losses would have been insufficient. Additionally, tie games were not counted in the standings in figuring winning percentage (under modern rules, ties count as ½ win and ½ loss).|$|E
5|$|Hitman Go was {{developed}} by Canadian video game studio Square Enix Montreal. It is the first game from the developer, {{which was founded in}} late 2011 by employees of existing Square Enix Europe studios. Upon establishment, the studio announced that their first project would be a new video game in the Hitman franchise. The studio's original aspiration was creating triple-A console games within the series and expanding <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> size of 150 people. After a year, while the team was still expanding, the console game was cancelled and the studio shifted its focus to mobile games. This transition led to around one third of the staff leaving the development team.|$|E

After the European trip, he helped lead Clay County to a 150 record in Amateur Athletic Union play. It was the first AAU season which recognized the three-point field goal, and Farmer made 53 of his 73 three-point attempts. In July 1987, the Kentucky Junior All-Stars finished second <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> from South Carolina in the Kentucky Prep All-Star Festival at Memorial Coliseum in Lexington; Farmer sat out the championship game with a hand injury he suffered in the previous game.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} 1934 season, Ruppert offered to make Ruth {{the manager of}} the Yankees' top minor-league team, the Newark Bears, but he was talked out of it by his wife, Claire, and his {{business}} manager, Christy Walsh. Shortly afterward, Tigers owner Frank Navin made a proposal to Ruppert and Barrow—if the Yankees traded Ruth to Detroit, Navin would name Ruth player-manager. Navin believed Ruth would not only bring a winning attitude <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> that had not finished higher than third since 1923, but would also revive the Tigers' sagging attendance figures. Navin asked Ruth to come to Detroit for an interview. However, Ruth balked, since Walsh had already arranged for him {{to take part in a}} celebrity golf tournament in Hawaii. Ruth and Navin negotiated over the phone while Ruth was in Hawaii, but those talks foundered when Navin refused to give Ruth a portion of the Tigers' box office proceeds.|$|E
5|$|Like Florida State, the Virginia Tech Hokies {{began the}} 1999college {{football}} season with raised expectations. In 1998, the Hokies had gone 93 {{during the regular}} season and had posted a 52 record against fellow Big East Conference teams. The Hokies concluded that 1998 season—which {{was supposed to be a}} rebuilding year—in the 1998 Music City Bowl, where the Hokies defeated the Alabama Crimson Tide, 387. With the addition of redshirt freshman quarterback Michael Vick <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> that had allowed an average of just 12.9points per game on defense, there was the possibility that Tech could improve upon its previous season's performance. Sports Illustrated, for example, predicted that the Hokies might challenge Miami for the Big East football championship, and the preseason Coaches' Poll ranked the Hokies No. 14 prior to the first game of the season.|$|E

5|$|Rare's Blast Corps began a run {{of seven}} highly lauded and {{respected}} Nintendo 64 games, including GoldenEye 007, Banjo-Kazooie, Perfect Dark, and Jet Force Gemini. Retro Gamer wrote that Rare had doubled the number of classic Nintendo 64 games and was an important alliance for Nintendo. Microsoft acquired Rare in 2002 for a record price of $377 million. The industry had changed, Blast Corps designer Martin Wakeley reflected {{a decade after the}} game's 1997 release. In 2009, Wakeley said, a studio would rarely entrust the scope of a project like Blast Corps <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> of four recent graduates.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{to improve}} his team's fortunes, Fletcher made several moves over the {{following}} seasons to rework the Flames roster. His goaltending tandem of Bouchard and Myre had begun to feud with each other by the 1977–78 season as both sought more playing time. Fletcher responded by naming Bouchard his number one goaltender and trading Myre to the St. Louis Blues for three players. They {{made it into the}} playoffs again but were the only team to fall <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> with fewer points than them, the Detroit Red Wings, in a best-of-three series, 2 games to 0. In March 1979, Fletcher completed an eight player trade that sent franchise-leading scorer Tom Lysiak and four players to the Chicago Black Hawks for three players, led by defenseman Phil Russell. Fletcher hoped that the addition of Russell would help his team achieve playoff success.|$|E
5|$|The Restaurant was {{the first}} time White had a kitchen staff {{organised}} into traditional brigades such as he had worked in while at Albert Roux's Le Gavroche. At Harveys, White had eight chefs under him on average, which was expanded <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> of about 20 at The Restaurant. Five of the chefs moved from Harveys to The Restaurant with him, while another former Harveys chef joined them among several others who joined from other Michelin starred restaurants from the UK and France. This enabled White to adopt a structure with himself, a head chef, a team of four or five sous chefs and teams on fish, meat/sauce, larder and pastry. Each of those sections was then broken down into a chef de partie heading the team, and then commis chefs under them. By 1994, Éric Chavot had joined the brigade as head chef under White. He left the following year with White's assistance to open the restaurant Interlude de Chavot.|$|E

5|$|The team {{started the}} 1977–78 {{season with a}} 50–10 mark, and some {{predicted}} a dynasty in Portland. However, Bill Walton suffered a foot injury that ended his season and would plague him over {{the remainder of his}} career, and the team struggled to an 8–14 finish, going 58–24 overall. In the playoffs, Portland lost to the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1978 conference semifinals. That summer, Walton demanded to be traded <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> of his choice (Clippers, Knicks, Warriors, or 76ers) because he was unhappy with his medical treatment in Portland. Walton was never traded, and he held out the entire 1978–79 season and left the team as a free agent thereafter. The team was further dismantled as Lucas left in 1980.|$|E
5|$|This {{section was}} named after a song by The Smiths. The motorboat driven by David Beckham arrived with the Olympic Flame via the Limehouse Cut and the Lee Navigation. Steve Redgrave lit his torch from that on the boat, and carried it into the stadium through an honour guard of 500 of the {{construction}} workers who had built the Olympic Park. He passed the flame on <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> of seven young people, each nominated by a famous British Olympian to convey the Games' aim to 'inspire a generation'.

Fabio Aru, who had won the Vuelta, was not present: he was riding the Tour of Almaty instead.|$|E

As he grew older, his father became concerned his son would become a latchkey kid, so he got his son involved with competitive swimming and quad-speed roller skating at age 6. He later switched from the instruction of Benton Redford, a National Champion, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> in Federal Way, WA called Pattisons Team Extreme and became a national inline speedskating champion and record holder himself. His father used Inline Speedskating to fill his spare time. Ohno's days were spent with morning swimming practices, followed by schooling, and finally skating practices in the afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Bianchi {{collided}} with {{the rear of the}} tractor crane, which caused extensive damage to his car; its roll bar was destroyed as it slid underneath. The impact jolted the tractor crane off the ground, causing Sutil's car (suspended in the air by the crane) to fall to the ground. Marshals moved away from the scene to avoid being struck by Bianchi's Marussia. Calculations in July 2015 indicated a peak of 254 g0 (2,490m/s2), and data from the FIA's World Accident Database—which sources information from racing accidents worldwide—indicate that Bianchi's impact occurred 2.61 seconds after loss of control, at a speed of 123km/h (76mph) and an angle of 55 degrees. Bianchi was reported unconscious after not responding <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> radio call or marshals. Marshals reported the accident, and safety and medical cars were dispatched. Bianchi was extracted from his car and treated at the crash site before being taken by ambulance to the circuit's medical centre. Transport by helicopter was impossible due to the weather; Bianchi was taken by ambulance with a police escort to Mie Prefectural General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, about 15km (9.3mi, a 32-minute drive) from the track.|$|E
5|$|Robson led Ipswich to {{two major}} trophies and several seasons in top flight European football. The {{successful}} period began in 1973 when the club won the Texaco Cup and finished {{fourth in the}} league, qualifying for the UEFA Cup for the first time. By the late 1970s, Robson had built a strong side with talent in every department, introducing the Dutch pair Arnold Mühren and Frans Thijssen to add flair <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> that featured British internationals including John Wark, Terry Butcher and Paul Mariner, although the Ipswich squad perhaps lacked the depth of established big clubs like Liverpool and Manchester United. Ipswich regularly featured {{in the top five}} of the league and in the UEFA Cup. At their peak in the 1979–80 season, they beat Manchester United 6–0 in a league game at Portman Road, a game where United goalkeeper Gary Bailey also saved three penalties. The defeat cost United two points – the margin which eventually separated them and champions Liverpool. Major success came in 1978 when Ipswich beat Arsenal at Wembley Stadium to win their only FA Cup trophy. The triumph was followed by a UEFA Cup victory in 1981. The club also finished as league runners-up in 1981 and 1982.|$|E
