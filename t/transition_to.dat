This is in contrast with only 0.4 % of men that reported such <b>transition.</b> Not <b>to</b> lose these <b>transitions</b> from women, we focus on transitions out of the labor force. <b>Transitions</b> <b>to</b> unemployment or disability were lower and did not show gender differences (1.7 % of men reported <b>transitioning</b> <b>to</b> disability vs. 1.3 % of women; 2.3 % of men reported <b>transitioning</b> <b>to</b> unemployment vs. 2.2 % of women). In any case, in the empirical analysis we also study only <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> self-reported retirement status {{as the dependent variable}} and results are robust to this alternative definition.|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{asked whether}} {{evolutionary}} <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> serpentine endemism are asso-ciated with <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> more favorable environments. Theory and observation suggest that benign (e. g., high rainfall and less extreme temperatures) climates should favor {{the evolution of}} habitat specialism, both because such climates may facilitate persistence of small populations with novel adaptations, and because competition with non-specialists may be stronger in benign climates. Non-climatic factors, such as habitat availability, should also be associated with <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> habitat specialism. We examined phylogenetic <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> serpentine endemism in 23 Californian plant taxa. We contrasted transitions from serpentine-intolerant ancestors, where speciation entails novel adaptations <b>to</b> ser-pentine, with <b>transitions</b> from serpentine-tolerant ancestors, where {{the formation of a}} new serpentine-endemic taxon may result from an altered competitive environment. We found that <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> endemism were strongly associated with <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> regions with more benign climates, but only in the case of endemics arising from intolerant ancestors. In contrast, <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> endemism from both types of ancestor were associated with tran-sitions to regions with greater habitat availability. These results are consistent with the expectation that benign climates promote the persistence of small populations with novel adaptations both before and after speciation...|$|R

40|$|In Experiment 1, pigeons {{were trained}} to peck keys with equal food-reinforcement {{schedules}} in components that ended with either noncontingent or contingent <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> a third component with a five-fold richer schedule. Response rates {{were higher in the}} initial component with contingent <b>transitions,</b> but resistance <b>to</b> prefeeding or extinction was not consistently greater. Experiment 2 also included noncontingent or contingent <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> a signaled period of nonreinforcement. There was no effect of the contingency on <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> nonreinforcement, but the difference in response rates maintained by contingent versus noncontingent <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> the richer schedule was replicated. In addition, response rates were higher in components that preceded nonreinforcement than in components that preceded the richer schedule. However, resistance to extinction was greater for noncontingent <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> the richer schedule than to nonreinforcement, implicating stimulus–reinforcer relations in the determination of resistance to change. Resistance to change was also somewhat greater for noncontingent than for contingent <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> the richer schedule. The latter result, together with the results of Experiment 1 and related research, suggests that response-contingent reinforcement does not increase resistance to change...|$|R

5|$|The {{history of}} super Barcelona {{has often been}} political. Though it is a club created and run by foreigners, Barcelona {{gradually}} became a club associated with Catalan values. In Spain's <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> autocracy in 1925, Catalonia became increasingly hostile towards the central government in Madrid. The hostility enhanced Barcelona's image as {{a focal point for}} Catalonism, and when Francisco Franco banned the use of the Catalan language, the stadium of Barcelona became {{one of the few places}} the people could express their dissatisfaction. The Spanish <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> democracy in 1978 has not dampened the club's image of Catalan pride. In the 2000s – a period of sporting success in the club and an increased focus on Catalan players – club officials have openly called for Catalonia to become an independent state.|$|E

30|$|Conditional on {{worker and}} job {{characteristics}} in column (2), the estimated probability of <b>transitioning</b> <b>to</b> unemployment between interviews for white native {{men in their}} first 10  years {{in the labor market}} is 0.056. The probabilities of <b>transitioning</b> <b>to</b> unemployment for members of every other group are statistically indistinguishable from and within 1 percentage point of the estimated probability for white natives in each specification in columns (2) to (6). This is particularly important insofar we restrict our sample to workers who remain employed in the second interview in subsequent analysis relating <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> wage growth. The similar estimated probabilities of <b>transitioning</b> <b>to</b> unemployment across groups suggests that this restriction is unlikely to materially affect our inferences.|$|R
