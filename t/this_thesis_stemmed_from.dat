40|$|The {{idea behind}} <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> an {{independent}} {{study of the}} works of the great John Milton. During this study, aspects of knowledge and how characters gained that insight began to fit together in a sort of mosaic. Adam, Samson, and Jesus each experienced different circumstances, yet there was a pattern to the outcomes of those circumstances and the men who withstood them. Each character appeared to learn about himself on three unique levels of learning, the intellectual, emotional, and spiritual. In the end of their stories, it was apparent that each character had discovered the design of his own learning and had integrated that self-knowledge into himself. In examining this self-knowledge, each character came to a greater and fuller understanding of God. This puzzle of reason, which, when solved, becomesa mirror of self-reflection, is the enigma of God. The solving of the puzzle in Milton's works is the inspriration for this journey through the minds, hearts, and souls of three men [...] Adam, Samson, and Jesus. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|E

The thesis demonstrated the heat generated and temperature recorded utilizing irreversible chemical temperature indicating labels during the induction sealing process on a standard bottle packaging line with an aluminum foil liner/innerseal. Based on the results of this study, the following trends were observed: as the induction seal head height increased above the container/closure system, the temperature at the foil innerseal decreased and the distance from the top of the bottle finish down into the bottle headspace that a temperature could be measured decreased. As the packaging line speed increased, the temperature at the foil innerseal decreased and the distance measured from the top of the bottle finish down into the bottle headspace that a temperature could be measured decreased. As the diameter of the foil innerseal increased with the increase in closure diameter, the temperature at the foil innerseal increased and the distance measured from the top of the bottle finish down into the headspace that a temperature could be measured increased. In no case did the temperature at the product fill level of any of the tested container/closure systems exceed 100 F.

It is argued that despite the seemingly limitless opportunities for self-learning in the ‘information age’, an interest for the technological is still not fostered within our society. This dissertation is inspired by Cedric Price’s proposal that, “[ [...] . ]every town should have a space at its disposal where the latest discoveries of engineering and science can provoke an environment for pleasure and discovery[ [...] . ]”. 1 It started with the search for a spatial models through which people could learn about and experience the essence of technology. The initial research looked at different ways people have learned about technology 1 Stanley Matthews, From Agit-Prop to Free Space: The Architecture of Cedric Price (London: Black Dog Publishing, 2007), 66. throughout history, focusing particular on examples where education could successfully be combined with leisure or recreational activities.

40|$|Hakutermit: Business-University-Government context, intermediating, service {{management}} system The society {{is going through}} development process which has created many challenges to all the key sectors of society: business, university and government. Businesses {{have to find ways}} to compete in global markets, universities are pressured to produce relevant knowledge on currents trends and governments need to carry out policies that support the ongoing development process. In the age of networking, the way to meet these challenges is by cooperating. This has created a need for dedicated intermediating actors, who facilitate interaction between the three sectors. The purpose of this research was to increase our understanding of intermediating activity between business, university and government. The idea for <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> the involvement of the researcher in the case phenomenon and thus from an adoption of a strong presunderstanding. The research was conducted as an inductive action research to correspond to this background. The preunderstanding was supported by theoretical analysis and the created framework was then applied to a case organization thus producing a concluding proposition. The Business-University-Government context is seen to be built from the main sectors of the society, both public and private, and in addition, separating the universities from the public sector. The intermediating activity is performed in organizations that operate between research institutions and businesses and that have been created through public financing to act as links between the different parties and facilitate the innovation process. The intermediating per se and the roles that it possesses are seen to be dynamic and dependent on the context. The {{service management}} system model was chosen to support and lead the empirical part of the research. The analysis of the case organization shows that operating in a new and ill-defined area and pursuing ambitious goals offers many challenges to an organization. To enable change and to act as a pioneer in an established institute, resources and time are needed {{in order to create a}} coherent service management system. For the case organization, the question is how to utilize and learn from the experience and develop intermediating activity that best suits for the Business-University- Government context.

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{prion protein}} (PrPC) {{is a highly}} conserved cell-surface glycoprotein expressed in almost all mammalian tissues, in particular in the central nervous systems. The bad reputation acquired by PrPC originates from its capacity to convert into an aberrant conformer (PrPSc), which is the major component of the prion, the unconventional infectious particle causing fatal neurodegenerative disorders, known as prion diseases. Both the mechanism of prion related neurodegeneration and the physiologic role of PrPC are still unknown. However, use of animal and cell models has underscored a number of putative functions for PrPC, suggesting that it could serve in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and differentiation, possibly by interacting with extracellular partners, and/or by taking part in multi-component signaling complexes at the cell surface. An intriguing hypothesis, based on increasing amounts of data that may explain the multifaceted behavior of PrPC, entails that the protein {{is involved in the}} regulation of Ca 2 + homeostasis One major part of the present thesis deals with a close investigation of the alleged regulation of Ca 2 homeostasis by PrPC. This study was carried out by monitoring local Ca 2 + movements in primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) - obtained from PrP-knockout mice and transgenic PrPC-expressing mice - subjected to various stimuli. Measurements of Ca 2 + fluxes in different cell domains were accomplished using the Ca 2 +- sensitive photo-protein aequorin genetically targeted to different cell domains (plasma membrane, cytosol, lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial matrix). We found that, with respect to PrPC-expressing neurons, the absence of PrPC caused alterations of local Ca 2 + movements, indicating that PrPC may be part of the cellular system(s) deputed to avoid toxic neuronal Ca 2 + accumulation. As for the molecular mechanisms by which PrPC controls Ca 2 + homeostasis, we found that this could be accomplished through the modulation of p 59 Fyn- and p 42 /p 44 -ERK-dependent signaling pathways. Another topic studied in <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> recent reports indicating that PrPC could acts as a high-affinity receptor for amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides implicated in Alzheimer's disease. The possibility that PrPC-Abeta interactions may impair synaptic plasticity is, however, still highly debated. Thus, given that Ca 2 + is intimately related to synaptic plasticity, we investigated whether Abeta peptides affected Ca 2 + metabolism in a PrPC-dependent manner using the above-mentioned strategies and cell paradigms. The obtained results showed that interactions between PrPC and Abeta oligomers may cause Ca 2 + accumulation following activation of store-operated Ca 2 + entry, and that this may occur via a PrPC-dependent activation of p 59 Fyn kinase. ...|$|E

Complementary colours: the structure of wavelength discrimination, uniform hue, spectral sensitivity, saturation, chromatic adaptation and induction [...] Conclusion. Complementary colours have been studied in science for over 300 years but little is known of their role in colour vision. Complementary colours are defined {{as a pair of}} colour stimuli which, with appropriate complementary wavelengths and ratios of radiant powers, admix a selected white (e. g. that of the illuminant). The thesis aim is to find and describe roles of complementary colours in colour perception. Only one role is generally accepted in the scientific literature: a colorimetric role in colour mixture and matching. A second role, in chromatic induction, was widely accepted until (erroneously) usurped 50 years ago by the opponent colours theory of chromatic induction. <b>This</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> signs that the visual system structures various visual functions from complementary colours. [...] Complementarism is shown to structure ten functions. For six of the functions, math models are formulated from complementary colours. The first three, closely related, papers describe three roles in colour constancy (see Appendix: Definitions), hue cycle structure, and hue cycle relative wavelength metric. Paper 1 describes complementary wavelengths' central role in a spectral mechanism of colour constancy, where constant hue and its complementary constant hue form parallel straight lines. Paper 2 establishes the roles of complementary colours in forming hue cycle structure and its wavelength-based metric. Dominant wavelength is extended into the nonspectrals/purples to form a relative wavelength scale over the whole cycle. Paper 3 utilises this scale to extend Paper 1 's spectral mechanism of colour constancy into the nonspectrals to complete the global mechanism. Paper 4 argues that chromatic induction is governed by complementary colours rather than opponent colours. Paper 5 formulates math models for six roles, in chromatic induction, wavelength discrimination, uniform hue, spectral sensitivity, saturation, and chromatic adaptation, from the ratio of either complementary wavelength intervals or of complementary powers; a seventh role, in three-dimensional color discrimination, is described. The total eleven varied roles (including the known colorimetric role) have a wide influence over the visual process from cones to cortex. These discrete roles indicate an overall role of complementary colours is structural, in shaping functions to a trimodal framework (RGB peaks and complementary CMY troughs), whose implicit purpose is to adapt functions to the illuminant. Thus, it is concluded the general role is colour constancy. Mode of access: World Wide Web. 164 leaves ill. (some col. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>This</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> my {{experience}} as a hospice social worker. In this role I was aware that children were often excluded from conversation, education and support about death, dying and bereavement and was keen to explore how the Hospice team could address this issue. My practice experience paralleled UK policy making on end-of-life care, which argued for discourse on death, dying and bereavement to be promoted in the community to help prevent negative end-oflife and bereavement experiences (Scottish Government 2008; Department of Health 2008; Department of Health 2010). In Scotland, engaging with schools to equip children with skills and knowledge to cope with death and bereavement has been emphasised (Scottish Government 2010). These policy movements recognise the significance of public health approaches to end-of-life care, which focus on the multi-dimensional (physical, psychological and social) nature of problems and required solutions. Recently, such approaches have been gaining recognition concerning their contribution to end-of-life care. It {{has been suggested that}} hospices are well situated to promote such activities due to their expertise in end-of-life care (Salau et al. 2007). Aim and objectives: This thesis aimed to explore, implement and evaluate models of best practice in which hospices and schools can work in partnership to promote education and support around death, dying and bereavement from a health promotion perspective. It specifically sought to increase understanding about current practice in primary schools related to death, dying and bereavement and develop practice knowledge {{about the role of the}} Hospice in working with school communities to enhance such work. Methods: The research was facilitated in two primary schools in Scotland, using collaborative inquiry within an action research methodology. It was conducted over three phases. Phase one (preparation and scoping) involved a literature review, visits to other hospices and focus groups with hospice staff. Phase two (exploration) included a series of interviews and focus groups with children aged 9 – 12 years, parents and schools staff to develop collaborative inquiry and engage in a process of change. Phase three (planning and developing) comprised of deciding and advancing models of practice. Findings: Practice innovations were identified at each school that were of relevance to the school curriculum, the relationship between hospices and school communities, and the relationship between hospices and the wider society more generally. These innovations can be understood as health promoting palliative care activities, as defined by Kellehear (2005), due to the process in which they were designed and their focus on developing capacity to respond to death, dying and bereavement. Conclusion: The action research process identified the significance of sharing and transferring knowledge across and between hospice and school communities. It demonstrated that hospices have unique capacity to develop conversation, education and support around death, dying and bereavement in school communities. In order to fulfil this potential role, this will require a reorientation of service delivery that focuses on wider training, support, awareness raising and advocacy. The study has also demonstrated that action research is well situated to develop health promoting palliative care activities according to the shared goals of participation, ownership and empowerment...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> {{the notion that}} the events of 9 / 11 would have a {{profound}} effect on how representations of Muslims on screen would need to be altered to match the political climate, and to project the trauma that the American public had experienced. However, in the course of the study it has emerged that changes to the old-style stereotypical representations might have been influenced by factors other than politics. By comparing and dissecting the content of films that displayed Islamic characteristics from a pre- 9 / 11 standpoint, I have been able to assess the degree to which visual and narrative changes have been implemented. I open with an introduction that establishes the framework and theories related to the emergence, maintenance and reformulation of stereotypes. I review the process of representing various ‘outsider’ groups in American cinema before attempting to trace against this the gradual shift in Islamic characteristics found in the movies of the pre- and post- 9 / 11 periods. The analysis includes definitions of the settings, locale, landscape and space as displayed on the theatrical screen. I discover that Muslim spaces which simply provided a setting for the action in the past are now acknowledged in terms of their interaction with their inhabitants. In much the same way that landscapes have been adapted from past cinematic depictions of the pre- 9 / 11 period, male and female characters are found to be constructed through a new perspective, allowing them to look more ‘human’ compared to their monolithic antecedents. The study also examines the rise of formidable American female characters and their victimization of the Muslim male ‘Other’. The current investigation is not limited to the depiction of adults only. The Muslim child/adolescent has become a recent device through which American filmmakers are exercising their creativity. Themes of childhood loyalty, disloyalty and redemption are explored in the case of Muslim youngsters, while the Muslim American youth is presented as the ‘hybrid Other’ desperately in search of his or her complex identity. Although there still exist examples of utilizing the overseas Muslim minor as a product of religious fanaticism, 9 / 11 initiated a new form of looking at a child. Artistic devices that have found their way into the commercial crop of U. S. movies include inner and external focalization, thus encouraging audiences’ empathy for the child who had until recently been treated as an image on the screen rather than a character in the narrative. The findings indicate that during the decade under consideration American cinema has not drawn as sharp a cultural line between the ‘Orient’ and the ‘Occident’ as it used to. Comparative work of this kind, with its focus on past and present cinematic depictions of the Muslim world, is beneficial, for it shows that there is eagerness in the U. S. to explore and reflect more on the characteristics of the Muslim ‘Other’ – an eagerness which will prove in the long run to be in the interests of both the East and the West...|$|E

40|$|The work in <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> the {{observation}} that patients with primary hypothyroidism share many clinical manifestations with hypothermic individuals. It is recognised that hypothermia may complicate hypothyroidism and hypothermic myxoedema coma is a particularly serious complication with a high mortality. There is much controversy about {{the best way of}} managing the condition and disagreement about whether 'rewarming' or urgent administration of thyroid hormones is beneficial or harmful. The studies in this thesis attempt to determine the relationship of body temperature and the thyroid axis and then assess the contribution of a subnormal body temperature to the clinical syndrome of hypothyroidism. The sections of the thesis follow a logical sequence. After a review of the interrelationship between the nervous system and the thyroid with particular reference to the regulation of TSH secretion, current knowledge of the interrelationship between diurnal rhythms in body temperature and TSH is analysed. Earlier studies had established (mostly in animals) that exposure to cold and heat influences TSH secretion by a central nervous pathway. Finally, the techniques available for the study of peripheral thyroid hormone actions are critically evaluated (Chapter 5). Alteration in serum enzymes were assessed and selected methods established in the laboratory. The first need was to develop an improved sensitive radioimmunoassay for TSH (Chapter 2) which demanded an intensive period of laboratory development, unfortunately now overtaken by a series of double monoclonal antibody methods which outstrip the improvements achieved. The first study was on the effect of cold exposure on thyroid function in normal subjects (Chapter 3) in which the concomitant elevations of circulating noradrenaline, TSH, T 4 and T 3 raises the possibility that the catecholamine {{plays a key role in}} adaptation to cold by its activation of the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid axis at several levels. Secondly, it was shown that the circadian inverse relationship between TSH and body temperature could be abolished by warming (Chapter 4), suggesting that body temperature has a key role in regulating circulating TSH. In order to evaluate to what extent the peripheral action of thyroid hormones can be affected by alterations in tissue responsiveness (as distinct from a marked alteration of circulating hormone levels), a comparison was made in patients with thyrotoxicosis of the effects of propranolol and carbimazole (Chapter 6). Propranolol has been used in the treatment of thyrotoxicosis. The actions are, of course, known to be complex, involving generalised beta adrenergic blockade, an effect on membrane stabilisation and inhibition of conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine. It was of interest that during propranolol administration none of the parameters studied showed any tendency to change towards normality from the values associated with the hyperthyroid state whilst a 'fixed dose' regime of Carbimazole resulted in euthyroid and occasionally hypothyroid responses. It would appear that the benefits of propranolol in thyrotoxicosis are chiefly due to its actions on the sympathetic nervous system. When hypothyroid subjects were warmed (Chapter 7) cell membrane permeability to certain enzymes decreased and systolic time intervals increased. The latter effect occurred before T 4 and T 3 levels fell as a result of warming. Overall, these observations suggest that warming hypothyroid patients may have an adverse effect on ventricular function. In contrast, nerve conduction velocity and motor responsiveness improved after warming, although sensory thresholds remained abnormal.

The objectives are to: (i) assess coastline change in Guyana; (ii) develop a physical-based coastal vulnerability index; and (iii) identify variables that influence the personal concern of coastal residents to water-related problems. The extraction of the Guyana coastlines from ten Landsat satellite images indicates spatial and temporal changes in 25 segments of the 128 km coastline of the Study Area. The estimates of the coastal vulnerability index identify segments of the coastline which are highly vulnerable to sea level rise. Education, age, and distance from the coast are the key variables that influence the level of personal concern. The thesis addresses the problem of paucity of coastal vulnerability research in Guyana. This is a contemporary research problem in low lying coastal areas throughout the world...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>This</b> <b>thesis</b> describes research which is aimed at devising a framework for a feature based workshop oriented NC planning. The principal objective of <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> is to utilize a feature based method which can rationalize and enhance part description and in particular part planning and programming on the shop-floor. This {{work has been done}} taking into account new developments in the area of shop floor programming. The importance of the techniques and conventions which are addressed in <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> the recognition that {{the most effective way to}} improve and enhance part description is to capture the intent of the engineering drawing by devising a medium in which the recurring patterns of turned components can be modelled for machining. Experimental application software which allows the user to describe the workpiece and subsequently generate the manufacturing code has been realized...|$|R
40|$|Introduction 1. 1 Motivation The {{original}} {{motivation for}} <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> the work {{several years ago}} by Dr. Bruce J. MacLennan and archeologist J. Penny Small {{on the effects of}} literacy and whether it played as important a role in bringing about The Greek Miracle as historians have claimed. They coined the name SimLit (for Simulating Literacy) for their work since they were setting up a simulation in an artificial life environment to investigate the effects literacy may have. The work of Christopher Langton, director of the artificial life program at the Sante Fe Institute in New Mexico, in his paper "Computation on the Edge of Chaos" also played a part in the motivation behind <b>this</b> <b>thesis.</b> In his paper, Langton finds similarities in the behaviors of computations and physical systems near phase transitions. In particular, he found a very interesting region on the edge of chaotic behavior which provided the optimal conditions for the transmission...|$|R
40|$|One part {{conservation}} {{assessment and}} one part historical background, <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> work {{conducted in the}} summer of 2012 at MacNider Art Museum in Mason City, Iowa. Funded by the Otto Thieme Scholarship from the Costume Society of America, the research offers a morphological study of the 400 puppets in the Bil Baird puppet collection. Spanning the period from 1918 to 1987, the puppets examined offer a survey of American history throughout the 20 th century, in context as well as content. The research catalogued the constituent parts of the object with suggestions for conservation. In an effort to draw parallels between 20 th century puppetry and contemporary puppet conservation, this paper explores the literature regarding the history of puppetry, basic puppet kinematics, and American marionette theatre. The research seeks to underscore the assessment by offering historical background on the puppeteer, Bil Baird and provide a reference for conserving a historic puppet collection...|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since the}} birth of the first quantum error {{correcting}} code, many error correcting techniques and formalism has been constructed so far. Among those, generating a quantum code on a locally planar geometry have lead to some interesting classes of codes. Main idea of <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> Kitaev's Toric code, which was the first surface code, yet it suffered from having a asymptotically vanishing encoding rate. In this paper, we propose a quantum surface code on a more complicated closed surface which has large genus, namely the Hurwitz surface. This code admits a constant encoding rate in the asymptotic limit that the number of genus goes to infinity. However, we give evidence that, where n is the number of qubits and t is the number of correctible errors, converges to 0 asymptotically. This is based on numerically generating many Hurwitz surfaces and observing the corresponding quantum code in the limit that genus number goes to infinity...|$|R
40|$|Condensed Living in Emergency Situations is {{a design}} based thesis {{that focuses on}} the {{amalgamation}} of comfort and safety through the design of a transportable disaster relief shelter. The “Unit” provides private and comfortable shelter to those displaced by a natural disaster, specifically in an urban setting. The concept for <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and the recovery and rebuilding process that then took place. Recognizing the occurrence and the positivity of community comradery, <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> design proposes a feasible solution to creating comfortable shelters for those displaced, while eliminating the need to relocate these families from their existing neighborhood. A combination of interior design and architectural methodologies, along with personal experiences, influenced the design of the “Unit”. Human factors and sustainability practices were included throughout the design process, and they are evident in the final design concept. Though this design concept can be implemented globally, a specific site location was chosen for the purpose of <b>this</b> <b>thesis.</b> Based in New York City following a theoretical coastal storm, <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> design project demonstrates how the “Unit” can positively influence the lives of others who are negatively affected by a natural disaster...|$|R
40|$|<b>This</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> the {{increasing}} ubiquity {{of cell phones}} in the cinema. It attempts to register {{the changes that have}} occurred in cinema in the wake of cellular telephone technology by considering the narrative, stylistic and symbolic significance of the technology in different cinematic environments. This project focuses on the stalker film, the contemporary Japanese horror film, and the network narrative film through the examples of Wes Craven's Scream Trilogy (19 %, 1997, 2000), Takashi Miike's Chakushin ari (2003), and Mike Figgis' Timecode (2000) respectively. Drawing on Avital Ronell's theory of telephonic subjectivity and Tom Gunning's work on the fixed telephone's affinity to film, it is argued that the cell phone's dimensions of mobility, mutability, ubiquity and constant touch have given rise to a new stage in telephonic logic. The case studies in <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> reveal through close readings, how film exploits this new logic, seizing on the emergent modalities of networked subjectivity and hyperconnected spatial relations to make film more dynamic and socially relevant. Finally it is argued that an examination of this exploitation makes legible the cell phone's social and psychological implications in quotidian life...|$|R

40|$|<b>This</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> {{a general}} {{interest}} in {{press coverage of}} culture industries and products {{and the ways in}} which it links them to contemporary social and political concerns. The present project specifically takes The Globe and The Toronto World, two of the major daily newspapers of Toronto, as its combined object of analysis. It selects particular events and periods during the emergence of early film as popular amusement as the contexts for the study of articles, reports, columns, and editorials that centred around urban cultural issues as well as cinema. It explores the extent to which these particular events and periods figured in the papers' attention upon the new medium and its place in the everyday life of the city. These contexts were selected with an assumption of their newsworthiness for the daily press. However, upon examination it became evident that, while the majority of them did produce a concentrated attention in both dailies, not all of them did. Still, because they instantiated profound shifts in urban entertainment at the turn of the century, they were kept as historical backgrounds for the analysis of the newspapers's construction of modern culture.

40|$|Abstract Background Western {{countries}} (Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada) with {{an indigenous}} population can all report disparities in health status between {{the majority and}} the indigenous population. Corresponding differences have not been found among the indigenous population in Norway, the Sami. Nevertheless, concerns regarding under-utilization of health care services and health disparities have emerged from previous studies from the 1980 s. Objective More recent studies {{have not been able}} to confirm findings of under-utilization, and the previous assumptions are currently being challenged. To determine whether there are ethnic differences in health care utilization in areas with both Sami and non-Sami populations in Norway, individually derived and population-based data is needed. Thus, <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> seeks to investigate potential ethnic differences in the number of general practitioner (GP) visits during the past year. Material and Methods Data used in <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> the SAMINOR 1 study; a cross-sectional study from 2003 - 2004 in northern Norway. Participants in this study include persons of Sami, Kven and/or Norwegian ethnicity in the same geographical area. Conclusion The findings in <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> confirm findings from other recent studies; overall, small differences in the number of GP visits during the past year were found when comparing Sami and non-Sami women and men in rur...|$|R
40|$|Issues {{addressed}} in <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> {{the current debate}} concerning a possible megapode rather than human origin of the large shell and earth mounds of northern Australia. Shell mounds attributed by archaeologists to human agency, are claimed by Stone (1989) to be identical to scrubfowl mounds, apparently requiring a reassessment of the criteria used to define the archaeological significance of shell mounds. <b>This</b> <b>thesis</b> examines Stone&# 039;s hypothesis, by differentiating {{the content of the}} argument put forward, from the approach used in its presentation. It is argued that not only are the conditions necessary for a theory to be considered scientific not met by Stone&# 039;s methodology, but that elements of cult archaeology are exhibited in his style of argument. Comparative field data is provided in <b>this</b> <b>thesis,</b> on shell mounds on Channel Island, interpreted by Stone (1989) as built by scrubfowl, and on shell mounds on nearby Middle Arm mainland, interpreted by archaeologists as built by humans. Significant differences are observed between the composition of shell mounds on Channel Island and those on Middle Arm, which are not explained by Stone&# 039;s hypothesis of the same formation processes for both types of mounds. It is concluded that archaeological criteria for differentiating agencies of formation provide a more coherent explanation for these differences...|$|R
