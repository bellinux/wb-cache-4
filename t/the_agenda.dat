5|$|Although a Senate seat {{would be}} {{disposed}} of by the Ohio General Assembly after the resignation of John Sherman to become Treasury Secretary, Hayes needed Garfield's expertise {{to protect him from}} <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> of a hostile Congress, and asked him not to seek it.

When Congress debated what became the Bland-Allison Act, to have the government purchase large quantities of silver and strike it into fully legal tender dollar coins, Garfield fought against this deviation from the gold standard, but it was enacted over Hayes's veto in February 1878.|$|E

40|$|Thousands {{die each}} day from infections related to water, as {{evidenced}} {{in the ongoing}} crises of cholera in Haiti, Zika in the Western Hemisphere, and Legionnaires’ Disease in Flint, Michigan. Yet water law focuses primarily on two <b>agendas.</b> First, <b>the</b> “Blue Agenda” aims to provide an equitable allocation of water to individuals and communities while encouraging sustainable water management. Second, the “Green Agenda” aims to efficiently protect water in the natural environment from pollution. These two agendas often ignore, and can be inconsistent with, <b>the</b> “Red <b>Agenda.</b> ” <b>The</b> Red <b>Agenda</b> addresses prevention of waterborne infections, like cholera, and the habitat of water-related disease vectors, like mosquitoes transmitting malaria. Additionally, <b>the</b> Red <b>Agenda</b> focuses on access to water for sanitation and hygiene, with implications for epidemics like Ebola. In simplified terms, <b>the</b> Blue <b>Agenda</b> is about water quantity, <b>the</b> Green <b>Agenda</b> about water quality, and <b>the</b> Red <b>Agenda</b> about water diseases. Laws made in pursuit of <b>the</b> Blue <b>Agenda,</b> like building a dam or irrigation system, can interfere with <b>the</b> Red <b>Agenda</b> by bringing mosquito habitat closer to human communities. And laws made {{in the pursuit of}} <b>the</b> Green <b>Agenda,</b> like prohibiting discharges of pesticides into a river, can interfere with <b>the</b> Red <b>Agenda</b> by preventing a response to a malaria outbreak. This Article is the first to introduce the Blue, Green, and Red framework for water law, and explains why these agendas often conflict with each other and how to more effectively integrate these agendas into water law...|$|R

5|$|The {{duties of}} the {{principal}} secretary were not defined formally, but as he handled all royal correspondence and determined <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> of council meetings, he could wield great influence in all matters of policy and in every field of government, both foreign and domestic.

5|$|The militant suffragettes, {{who were}} at one point public enemies, were now seen as fierce {{nationalist}} and patriots. Old foes became allies and vice versa. Lloyd George was now referred to as 'that great Welshman' while Labours' Kier Hardie, the WSPU's staunchest defender before the war, was lambasted for his pacifist stance. There were still those in the suffragette movement who wished to keep pushing <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> of emancipation. Some members of the WSPU broke away to form the Suffragettes of the WSPU (SWSPU), amongst their members were Conway-born Helena Jones, who continued to campaign for women's votes and was a columnist in the Suffragists News Sheet.|$|E

50|$|Though Maxwell McCombs {{already had}} some {{interest}} in the field, he was exposed to Cohen's work while serving as {{a faculty member at}} UCLA, and it was Cohen's work that heavily influenced him, and later Donald Shaw. <b>The</b> concept of <b>agenda</b> setting was launched by McCombs and Shaw during the 1968 presidential election in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. They examined Lippmann's idea of construction of the pictures in our heads by comparing the issues on <b>the</b> media <b>agenda</b> with key issues on <b>the</b> undecided voters' <b>agenda.</b> They found evidence of agenda setting by identifying that salience of <b>the</b> news <b>agenda</b> is highly correlated to that of <b>the</b> voters' <b>agenda.</b> McCombs and Shaw were the first to provide the field of communication with empirical evidence that demonstrated the power of mass media and its influence on <b>the</b> public <b>agenda.</b> <b>The</b> empirical evidence also earned this theory its credibility amongst other social scientific theories.|$|R
