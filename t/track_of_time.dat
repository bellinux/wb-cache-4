25|$|One of {{the most}} {{signature}} symptoms of mania (and to a lesser extent, hypomania) is what many have described as racing thoughts. These are usually instances in which the manic person is excessively distracted by objectively unimportant stimuli. This experience creates an absent-mindedness where the manic individual's thoughts totally preoccupy him or her, making him or her unable to keep <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> or be aware of anything besides the flow of thoughts.

25|$|The {{manner of}} {{timekeeping}} in Australian rules football is unusual {{compared with other}} sports, in that the timekeepers keep <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> using a count-down clock which begins at 20 minutes and is stopped during any time-on; but, clocks displayed at the ground count up from zero and are not stopped during time-on. As such, spectators and players present at the ground never know exactly how much time is left in the game. The timekeepers' countdown clock is seen by the coaches and is shown by many television broadcasters.|$|E
25|$|A crystal {{oscillator}} is an electronic circuit {{that uses the}} mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material to create an electrical signal with a very precise frequency. This frequency is commonly used to keep <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> as used in quartz wristwatches, to provide a stable clock signal for digital integrated circuits, and to stabilize frequencies for radio transmitters and receivers. The first crystal-controlled oscillator, using a crystal of Rochelle Salt, was invented by Alexander M. Nicholson. However, it is generally accepted that Dr. Walter Guyton Cady {{was the first to}} use a quartz to control the frequency of an oscillator circuit. Nevertheless, Nicholson is still regarded as the inventor of the {{crystal oscillator}}.|$|E
25|$|Another paradox {{associated}} with the causality and the one-way nature of time is Loschmidt's paradox which poses the question how can microprocesses that are time-reversible produce a time-irreversible increase in entropy. A partial resolution to this paradox is rigorously provided for by the fluctuation theorem which relies on carefully keeping <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> averaged quantities to show that from a statistical mechanics point of view, entropy is {{far more likely to}} increase than to decrease. However, if no assumptions about initial boundary conditions are made, the fluctuation theorem should apply equally well in reverse, predicting that a system currently in a low-entropy state is {{more likely to have been}} at a higher-entropy state in the past, in contradiction with what would usually be seen in a reversed film of a nonequilibrium state going to equilibrium. Thus, the overall asymmetry in thermodynamics which is at the heart of Loschmidt's paradox is still not resolved by the fluctuation theorem. Most physicists believe that the thermodynamic arrow of time can only be explained by appealing to low entropy conditions shortly after the big bang, although the explanation for the low entropy of the big bang itself is still debated.|$|E

He first appears as a carefree character as he tends to lose <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> and is frequently late to his appointments as a result. However, when testing his students, Kakashi reveals himself as a strong opponent to the point he fights while reading [...] series of erotic novels. Kakashi is revealed to be very famous in the Naruto world, earning him the moniker [...] for possessing the Sharingan, gaining it from {{a member of the}} Uchiha clan he was friends with. It grants him the ability to mimic the movements and jutsu of others. Although most of Kakashi's abilities were acquired with his Sharingan, he also invented the Chidori and its [...] Lightning Blade variation, a collection of lightning chakra in one's hand that uses the Sharingan's visual ability to lock onto a target. When first forming Team 7, Kakashi does not turn them into his students until instilling in them the concept of teamwork even if they have to break the rules he gave them. Kakashi continues to further this philosophy for the duration of Part I upon Sasuke Uchiha but is unable to get through to him before the latter's defection from Konoha. Kakashi also reluctantly participates in various kinds of challenges by his childhood friend Might Guy who considers Kakashi his rival.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Björk starred on {{her acting}} debut Dancer in the Dark. Whilst {{she worked on}} the film, she also began {{producing}} her next album, writing new music and teaming with new collaborators. She {{had to go to}} Denmark to work on the film and there was nothing going on. She was lying on the beach whilst looking at the ocean, with a ghetto blaster listening to producer Thomas Knak's music. When she realised he was from Copenhagen, she called him up". [...] "Cocoon", produced by Knak, {{was one of the last}} songs to be written for the album; its melody came to Björk in a sudden rush and she contacted him. She made a long-distance, late-night phone call to Knak in Denmark, and woke him up. [...] "I didn't have any <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> so she didn't really know that I was asleep. She was explaining that she had this melody in her head and maybe, if I had the time, she would still have two or three weeks to decide if this track could be worked on", said the producer. Knak took it as a chance to make a more minimal track, similar to his own releases. He liked the idea of having two songs on the album, and immediately after he put down the phone, he started working. His original treatment of [...] "Cocoon", made with an Ensoniq ASR-10, appeared relatively intact in the final version. Knak elaborated: [...] "She had two changes: one for one semitone up and another for I think about 20BPM slower or something. I don't really make music so I'm not really used to thinking could the singer really sing in a tempo. From there she started working on the lyrics and one more melody for the vocal".|$|E

2500|$|Camping assumed that, since qara shem implies an {{immediate}} father–son relationship (e.g., Adam–Seth, Seth–Enos and Lamech–Noah), all other {{relationships between the}} Antediluvian patriarchs (except Noah–Shem) are of ancestors and their distant descendants. That is, when one patriarch died, the next one who is mentioned was not his son, but was actually a distant multi-generational grandson {{who was born in}} that same year. Camping thus formulated the concept of the [...] "reference patriarch," [...] i.e., various events are referenced to a specific year of a particular patriarch's life as a means of keeping an accurate chronological record.

2500|$|Patrick Ireland had regained {{and lost}} {{consciousness}} several times after being shot by Klebold. He crawled {{to the library}} windows where, at 2:38p.m., he stretched out the window, intending {{to fall into the}} arms of two SWAT team members standing on the roof of an emergency vehicle, but instead falling directly onto the vehicle's roof in a pool of blood. They were later criticized for allowing Ireland to drop more than seven feet to the ground while doing nothing to try to ensure he could be lowered to the ground safely or break his fall. Eighteen-year-old Lisa Kreutz, shot in the shoulder, arms, hand, and thigh, remained in the library. In a subsequent interview, she recalled hearing a comment such as, [...] "You in the library," [...] around the time of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold's suicides. Kreutz lay in the library, keeping <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> by the sound of the school's bells until police arrived. She had tried to move but became light-headed.

It may be difficult, but I still intend to gather and bring them together. I am afraid {{this is not what}} you wish to see." [...] Sun Ce knelt down and said, [...] "What I want is your sincerity. I hope you will return by midday tomorrow." [...] When Sun Ce's subordinates raised doubts about Taishi Ci's loyalty, Sun Ce said, [...] "Taishi Ziyi is a famous man from Qing Province. He is known for keeping his promises. I believe he will not deceive me." [...] The following day, Sun Ce hosted a banquet and had a pole erected in the middle, so as to keep <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> by observing its shadow.
