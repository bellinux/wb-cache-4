25|$|They led the High Priest down to {{the place}} of {{immersion}} (the mikveh). During the day of Yom Kippur, the High Priest would immerse himself five times and wash his hands and feet ten times. Except for this first immersion, he would do each on holy ground in the Parwah cell. They spread a linen sheet between him and the people. If the High Priest was either old or delicate, they warmed the water for him. He undressed, immersed himself, came up, and dried off. <b>They</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> the golden garments; he put them on and washed his hands and feet.|$|E
25|$|Born {{during the}} Ancien Régime in Rouen, Adrien Boieldieu {{received}} his musical education first from the choirmaster {{and then from}} the organist of the local cathedral. During the Reign of Terror, Rouen {{was one of the}} few towns to maintain a significant musical life and in 1793 a series of concerts was organised featuring the celebrated violinist Pierre Rode and the tenor Pierre-Jean Garat. It was during this time that Boieldieu composed his earliest works to texts written by his father (La fille coupable in 1793, followed by Rosalie et Mirza in 1795). <b>They</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> immediate success.|$|E

Soon after, they were satisfied with the results and sent them to Bulgaria for a secret retreat. On 9 October, the Soviet secret service had a meeting in which Bogdanov, Gorelov, Pavlonsky and Puzanov were the main chiefs who were discussing what to do with Amin who was very harsh at the meeting. After the two-hour meeting they began to worry that Amin will establish an Islamic Republic in Afghanistan and decided to seek a way to put Karmal back in. <b>They</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> and three other ministers secretly to Moscow during which time they discussed how to put him back in power. The decision was to fly him back to Bagram airbase by 13 December. Four days later, Amin's nephew, Asadullah, was taken to Moscow by the KGB for acute food poisoning treatment.|$|E

500|$|Other {{characters}} {{returned from}} the first year. Actor Jim Beaver made multiple appearances as hunter Bobby Singer, an old family friend of the Winchesters. Beaver had expected his first-season guest appearance in [...] "Devil's Trap" [...] to be a [...] "one-shot deal", and was surprised {{when he was asked}} to return. Adrianne Palicki reprised her role as Sam's deceased girlfriend Jessica in the alternate-reality episode [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be", as did Samantha Smith as Mary Winchester. Smith also made an appearance in a flashback in the penultimate episode, [...] "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part One". And though at first reluctant because of his role on Grey's Anatomy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan returned as John Winchester in the season premiere and finale. However, the character dies in the premiere because the writers worried that having him separated from his sons again—Sam and Dean spend much of the first season tracking him down—would [...] "split the show" [...] by having him away [...] "doing more interesting things than the boys are doing". As a demon, the villain Azazel periodically switches hosts, and was first fully portrayed by Morgan in the first-season finale. The reins passed to Fredric Lehne for the second-season premiere, and the show's producers enjoyed his performance so much <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> back for the two-part finale.|$|E

Then he went down and {{immersed}} himself for the second time, came up and dried himself. <b>They</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> white garments (as required by [...] ). He put them on and washed his hands and feet. Rabbi Meir taught that in the morning, he wore Pelusium linen worth 12 minas, and in the afternoon he wore Indian linen worth 800 zuz. But the sages said that in the morning, he wore garments worth 18 minas, and in the afternoon he wore garments worth 12 minas. The community paid for these sums, and the High Priest could spend more from his own funds if he wanted to.|$|E

Once the Israelites came upon a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day, and <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> before Moses, Aaron, and the community and placed him in custody. God told Moses that the whole community was to stone him to death outside the camp, so they did so. God told Moses to instruct the Israelites to make for themselves fringes ( [...] , tzitzit) on each of the corners of their garments. They were to look at the fringes, recall the commandments, and observe them.|$|E

Khalil promised the messengers to spare the life of everyone if the Franks hand him Acre peacefully, but the messengers refused his offer. While the messengers were still there a huge catapult stone launched from the city struck the ground near the sultan's tent.

Passing Midianite merchants drew Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for 20 shekels of silver, and <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> to Egypt. When Reuben returned to the pit and Joseph was gone, he rent his clothes and asked his brothers where he could go now. They took Joseph's coat of many colors, dipped it in goat's blood, {{and sent it to}} Jacob to identify. Jacob concluded that a beast had devoured Joseph, and rent his garments, put on sackcloth, and mourned for his son. All his sons and daughters tried in vain to comfort him. And the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, Pharaoh's captain of the guard.

2500|$|Reggie [...] "Redman" [...] Noble {{spent the}} {{majority}} of his youth selling drugs, and DJing at clubs and parties. At the age of 16, he began rapping, being heavily influenced by the comedy raps of Biz Markie. Although, he would eventually become a close affiliate of the hip hop duo EPMD, it wasn't until 1990, where Redman first met them, while DJing for DoItAll (of Lords of the Underground) at a club where MC Lyte was headlining. The two parties eventually met backstage where a freestyle cipher was taking place, with EPMD member Erick Sermon being so impressed with Redman's raps that he invited him to perform during the duo's set. Before long, EPMD quickly embraced Redman as a Hit Squad member, while <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> on tour to freestyle and DJ at their shows. In addition, EPMD gave Redman two guest spots for the songs [...] "Hardcore" [...] and [...] "Brothers on My Jock", off their third album Business as Usual (1990), which helped him gain exposure in the hip hop underground. One year later, Redman was signed to Def Jam, where he began writing and recording what would eventually become Whut? Thee Album.|$|E

Tiriel responds in a rage, turning her locks of hair into snakes, although he vows that if she brings him to the Vales of Har, he will return her hair to normal. On the way through the mountains, as they pass the cave wherein lives Zazel and his sons, Hela's cries of lamentation awaken them, and they hurl dirt and stones at Tiriel and Hela, mocking them as they pass; [...] "Thy crown is bald old man. The sun will dry thy brains away/And thou wilt be as foolish as thy foolish brother Zazel" [...] (7:12-13). Eventually Tiriel and Hela reach the Vales of Har, but rather than celebrating his return, Tiriel condemns his parents, and the way <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> up, declaring that his father's laws and his own wisdom now [...] "end together in a curse" [...] (8:8); ...|$|E

2500|$|The Blazers valued Petrović as a shooter, {{but were}} {{concerned}} {{that he might not}} possess the quickness to play guard or the foot speed to play defense. <b>They</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> onto the team primarily as an outside threat to shoot three-pointers. In the Blazers' offensive scheme he was to set up behind the line, receive a passed ball and go directly up to release his shot. Petrović was an aggressive, attacking player who was used to creating his shot and shots for his teammates. Taking the ball out of his hands and making him a static shooter was foreign to him. Making matters worse, the Blazers already had a full rotation of guards, with a starting backcourt of Clyde Drexler and Terry Porter, and with veteran Danny Young as a reserve. Consequently, the reigning La Gazzetta dello Sport Euroscar European Player of the Year saw limited playing time. He had difficulty being productive in the limited role the Blazers had for him. In his rookie year during the 1989–90 NBA season, he averaged 7.4 points in 12 minutes playing time per game. The following season veteran guard Danny Ainge was added to the team, and Petrović's playing time dropped further to 7 minutes a game. In many statements made prior to arriving in Portland, Petrović had said he saw a lack of playing time as the only possible obstacle to his success in the NBA. He was determined to be a success in basketball's highest arena. His lack of playing time during his second season in the league brought Petrović's frustration to a climax: ...|$|E
