In his Institutes of the Lawes of England, Edward Coke interpreted Magna Carta protections and rights to apply not just to nobles, but to all British subjects. In writing the Virginia Charter of 1606, he enabled the King in Parliament <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>those</b> to be born in the colonies all rights and liberties {{as though they were}} born in England. William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England were the most influential books on law in the new republic.|$|E

25|$|As black colored wolves occur more {{frequently}} in forested areas than on the tundra (black coats occur in about 62% of wolves in the forested areas of the Canadian Arctic, compared with about 7% in the icy tundra), melanism was concluded by the researchers <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>those</b> wolves an adaptive advantage. The mutation’s purpose {{has not yet been}} identified. Dr Barsh ruled out camouflage, as wolves have few natural predators, and {{there is no evidence that}} a black coat color leads to any increase in hunting success rates. Dr. Barsh observed that beta-defensin is involved in providing immunity to viral and bacterial skin infections, which might be more common in forested, warmer environments. It has been suggested that the mutation's association with forested habitats means that the prevalence of melanism should increase as forests expand northward. Dark fur is believed to be dominant in wolves. A mating between a black and a gray wolf resulted in ten pups with dark fur out of a total of fourteen.|$|E

McG met with The Terminator and Terminator 2 composer Brad Fiedel but was not interested in repeating the sounds Fiedel achieved in his films. However,McG wanted Elfman <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>those</b> themes and ambient sounds a [...] "Wagnerian quality".|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} XIII games in particular, Parish {{suggested}} that their mixed reactions influenced the title changes of other {{games in the}} original series, giving the teams a chance <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>those</b> games more of their own identity. He also felt {{that the decision to}} expand the XIII storyline into multiple games [...] "probably worked out just as well". The presentation of the mythos and its terms received mixed reactions in XIII, resulting in the production team toning down their use for XIII-2. Siliconera writer Spencer Yip, in his review of Lightning Returns, commented that the story and pace of the game was [...] "muddled" [...] by the mythos. In 2016, RPGFan writer Mike Salbato wrote a retrospective of the XIII games and their version of Fabula Nova Crystallis: he felt that the lack of specific references to the mythos in XIII had harmed general comprehension, and that a reliance on foreknowledge made its sequels difficult to play as standalone titles. In contrast, the portrayal of the mythos in Type-0 was praised by RPG Site's Erren Van Duine in an import review of the title, with him saying that [...] "elements such as l'Cie and fal'Cie are handled in much more interesting ways". When commenting on the lore of XV, Andrew Reiner of Game Informer praised the story for sticking to basics and avoiding [...] " [...] the player with lore or branching threads, something Final Fantasy XIII struggled with".|$|E

500|$|Despite Volition's {{interest}} {{and desire to}} develop add-ons and expansions for FreeSpace 2, Interplay told them to stop. Volition was then acquired by THQ in 2000. As Interplay owns {{the rights to the}} FreeSpace series (as well as the Descent series) and Volition's owners, THQ, is only interested in pursuing development on what they own, Volition was unable to continue developing the FreeSpace franchise. Faced with source code which became practically useless to them, Volition released the source code for only game engines to the public under a noncommercial license on April 25, 2002. Mike Kulas, the President of Volition, said this was <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>those</b> outside the game industry {{a chance to look at}} the code of a commercial software product, a desire he and Matt Toschlog had when they were not yet in the industry. In the years since, no sequels to FreeSpace 2 have been made and Interplay has only published a limited re-release of it on February 2, 2004, to commemorate the company's 20th anniversary. [...] Interplay, by that time, was in financial trouble, failing to pay rent and wages to its workers. [...] Seeking investors to inject it with funds, Interplay changed business strategies: instead of developing and publishing single-player games, it sold licenses to those games and looked towards developing massive multi-player online games. Derek Smart, creator of Battlecruiser 3000AD, had casually mentioned his interest in the Freespace license, but nothing significant came out of this. In 2013, Interplay acquired the remaining rights to the FreeSpace franchise for $7,500 after THQ went to bankruptcy court.|$|E
2500|$|Salt Lake Comic Con, {{which started}} in 2013, has grown to over 100,000 people in just over two years. Because of this, Salt Lake Comic Con started having a second event, FanX (Fan Experience) <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>those</b> who {{were not able to}} come to the fall Comic Con an {{opportunity}} in the spring. The convention broke inaugural records in 2013, hosting the largest crowd of any inaugural comic convention. The second event, FanX of 2014, and the fall event of 2014 both broke attendance records for the event, surpassing 120,000 people. The convention was sued by San Diego Comic Con, but won the right to use the trademark of comic con in its name. In 2014, Stan Lee called the Salt Lake Comic Con [...] "the greatest comic con in the world". On September 25, 2015 at 6 pm, the Con broke the world record for the most costumed comic book cosplay characters in one location. At 1784 people, this beat the previous record by about 250, surpassing the International Animation CCJOY LAND in Changzhou City, China, which had gathered 1530 people on April 29, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|At 3 am on April 5, 1994, Abigail Alling and Mark Van Thillo, {{members of}} the first crew, {{allegedly}} vandalized the project from outside, opening one double-airlock door and three single door emergency exits, leaving them open for approximately fifteen minutes. [...] Five panes of glass were also broken. [...] Alling later told the Chicago Tribune that she [...] "considered the Biosphere {{to be in an}} emergency state... In no way was it sabotage. It was my responsibility." [...] About 10% of the biosphere's air was exchanged with the outside during this time, according to systems analyst Donella Meadows, who received a communication from Ms. Alling in which she explained that she and Van Thillo judged it their ethical duty <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>those</b> inside the choice of continuing with the drastically changed human experiment or leaving, as they didn't know what the crew had been told of the new situation. “On April 1, 1994, at approximately 10 AM … limousines arrived on the biosphere site … with two investment bankers hired by Mr. Bass … They arrived with a temporary restraining order to take over direct control of the project … [...] With them were 6-8 police officers hired by the Bass organization … They immediately changed locks on the offices … All communication systems were changed (telephone and access codes), and [...] were prevented from receiving any data regarding safety, operations, and research of Biosphere 2.” Alling emphasized several times in her letter that the “bankers” who suddenly took over “knew nothing technically or scientifically, and little about the biospherian crew.” ...|$|E
