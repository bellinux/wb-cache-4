5|$|John pleads with General Ashdown {{to delay}} the {{offensive}} so he can formulate a plan to extract the human captives, but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However, the Resistance disobeys Ashdown's orders and instead, await John's signal. Marcus enters the base, interfaces with the computer, and disables perimeter defenses so that Connor can infiltrate the cellblock and release human prisoners. Wright learns from Skynet (which assumes the form of Dr. Kogan on a screen), that he was created and built from the original Wright's corpse to lure John to the base; when the Resistance launches its attack, John will be killed, achieving the goal that Skynet had failed <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> <b>in</b> the past. The hidden signal that the Resistance received earlier is revealed {{to have been a}} ruse, and Skynet uses it to track down and destroy the command submarine with the Resistance's leaders aboard.|$|E
5|$|The {{collective}} leadership {{first set}} out to stabilize the Soviet Union and calm Soviet society, a task which they were able <b>to</b> <b>accomplish.</b> <b>In</b> addition, they attempted to speed up economic growth, which had slowed considerably during Khrushchev's last years as ruler. In 1965, Kosygin initiated several reforms to decentralize the Soviet economy. After initial success in creating economic growth, hard-liners within the Party halted the reforms, fearing that they would weaken the Party's prestige and power. No other radical economic reforms were carried out during the Brezhnev era, and economic growth began to stagnate in the early-to-mid-1970s. By Brezhnev's death in 1982, Soviet economic growth had, according to several historians, nearly come to a standstill.|$|E

Strikers threw rocks and sticks; some attempted sabotage. Irving obtained a court injunction, and had supervisors sleep in bunkhouses at the plant. Clerks and bookkeepers were able <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> <b>in</b> 22,000 man-hours per month what the union did in 46,700. Irving managed to break the union.|$|E

25|$|Daoud had however {{achieved}} {{little of}} what he had set out <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> <b>in</b> 1978. The Afghan economy hadn't made any real progress and the Afghan standard of living had not risen. Daoud had also garnered much criticism for his single party constitution in 1977 which alienated him from his political supporters. By this time, the two main factions of the PDPA, previously locked in a power struggle, had reached a fragile agreement for reconciliation. Communist-sympathizing army officials were by then already planning a move against the government. According to Hafizullah Amin, who became Afghan head of state in 1979, the PDPA had started plotting the coup in 1976, two years before it materialized.|$|E

25|$|A basic {{distinction}} is between sculpture in the round, free-standing sculpture, such as statues, not attached (except possibly at the base) {{to any other}} surface, and {{the various types of}} relief, which are at least partly attached to a background surface. Relief is often classified by the degree of projection from the wall into low or bas-relief, high relief, and sometimes an intermediate mid-relief. Sunk-relief is a technique restricted to ancient Egypt. Relief is the usual sculptural medium for large figure groups and narrative subjects, which are difficult <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> <b>in</b> the round, and is the typical technique used both for architectural sculpture, which is attached to buildings, and for small-scale sculpture decorating other objects, as in much pottery, metalwork and jewellery. Relief sculpture may also decorate steles, upright slabs, usually of stone, often also containing inscriptions.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great." [...] He wrote that although [...] "Welcome Wagon" [...] was designed to appeal to new viewers, that {{it was still a}} good episode. [...] "'Welcome Wagon', written by Thomas, proves the show is as clever and witty as ever. [...] The more exposition-heavy aspects of the premiere mean the episode isn't a true standout for the series, but that's understandable, given what it's trying to accomplish." [...] He went on to state that the episode featured more [...] "lighthearted" [...] content before what he predicted would be a return to more dramatic elements. Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, gave a positive review, stating, [...] "Great first episode back…There was a lot <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> <b>in</b> setting up the new environment and characters, but it still felt really organic to the series as a whole." [...] While criticizing the fact that the rape victims experienced a backlash against them, he enjoyed the characterization of Piz.|$|E
500|$|British {{comic book}} writer Paul Jenkins {{was drafted by}} Crystal Dynamics to help refine the game's script. Though Soul Reaver {{features}} a variety of boss encounters, Soul Reaver 2 does not; this was a conscious decision {{on the part of}} the staff, to ensure the game's pacing more closely emulated that of a novel or a film. While expanding the series' fiction, Hennig sought to take people back to the characters and mythology of the original Blood Omen, and built on its latent themes, including issues of fatalism, ethical dilemma and morality. In an interview, she stated that [...] "the game will have a proper ending this time", and said [...] "it has a conclusion. It's the end of a chapter. There won't be a cliffhanger". However, the story needed to be restructured several times before its completion, and, like the original Soul Reaver, many planned areas and abilities were excised, including three elemental forges (earth, water and spirit), more Reaver enhancements, and nine [...] "spell-type things". She explained that the project's small programming crew, its switch to the PlayStation 2, and its limited 17 month production schedule had forced the team to [...] "pick their battles", leading numerous features to be simplified or eliminated. Commenting on the final product, lead designer Richard Lemarchand said that Soul Reaver 2 [...] "fell short of what the team had wanted <b>to</b> <b>accomplish.</b> <b>In</b> particular, some puzzles were too opaque, the combat was rather one-dimensional, [...] ended without a decent resolution".|$|E
