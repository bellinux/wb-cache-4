5|$|The {{equatorial}} ring {{goes around}} <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (degrees) {{away from the}} pole. The circle of the ecliptic also goes round <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 (degrees) and a fraction away from the pole, while at the winter solstice it is 115 (degrees) and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away. The former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the (results obtained by the) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia (dynasty) calendar.|$|E
5|$|A {{thin layer}} of horn is glued onto what will be <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bow, the side facing the archer. Water buffalo horn is very suitable, as is horn of several antelopes such as gemsbok, oryx, ibex, and that of Hungarian grey cattle. Goat and sheep horn can also be used. Most forms of cow horn are not suitable, as they soon {{delaminate}} with use. The horn can store more energy than wood in compression.|$|E
5|$|ARCHER is {{a daytime}} {{non-invasive}} technology, which works by analyzing an object’s reflected light. It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings. The system uses a special camera facing down through a quartz glass portal in <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500feet (800meters) and 100 knots (50meters/second) ground speed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> immunocastration and {{ractopamine}} in {{the diet}} on <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> quality were investigated from two crossbred pigs under different conditions of production, diet, management, and slaughter arranged in factorial design using two levels of addition <b>of</b> ractopamine in <b>the</b> diet, 0 and 7. 5 ppm, and three genders (gilts, immunocastrated and barrows). <b>The</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>bellies</b> were analyzed for chemical composition, pH, meat and fat color, backfat thickness and fatty acid profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fat. <b>The</b> addition <b>of</b> ractopamine showed no significant influence on pH, color and chemical composition in two crossbred pigs. The immunocastrated had thicker belly backfat compared to <b>the</b> <b>bellies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gilts. <b>The</b> contents <b>of</b> fatty acids polyunsaturated, linoleic, linoleic, arachidonic, total omega 3 and omega 6 were higher for immunocastrated pigs, as well as presenting values greater than 0. 4 for the PUFA:SFA ratio, thus, providing bellies with better nutritional quality. <b>The</b> <b>bellies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gilts and immunocastrated pigs had higher concentrations of iodine value, indicative of higher unsaturated fat content. The results indicated that <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> ractopamine and immunocastration had little influence on <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>bellies</b> {{as well as in}} their fatty acid profiles, suggesting <b>the</b> continuity <b>of</b> implementation of these techniques...|$|R
40|$|We {{observed}} a bilateral and symmetrical variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digastric muscle during <b>the</b> dissection <b>of</b> a 35 -year-old female cadaver.

5|$|The Boat Captain– A humorous addition, the Boat Captain {{encountered}} Kratos {{on several}} occasions, although these were always to the Boat Captain's detriment.

In God of War II, the Boat Captain fled from Kratos as a spirit even though summoned to fight him, and in God of War III, {{he left a}} note of hatred towards Kratos in the Underworld and his voice was heard in Kratos' psyche. The character was voiced by Keith Ferguson in God of War and God of War II, and Josh Keaton in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s these battleships {{made use}} of the RQ-2 Pioneer, an {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle employed in spotting for the guns. Launched from the fantail using a rocket-assist booster that was discarded shortly after takeoff, the Pioneer carried a video camera in a pod under <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft which transmitted live video to the ship so operators could observe enemy actions or fall of shot during naval gunnery. To land the UAV a large net was deployed {{at the back of}} the ship; the aircraft was flown into it. Missouri and Wisconsin both used the Pioneer UAVs successfully during Operation Desert Storm, and in one particularly memorable incident, a Pioneer UAV operated by Wisconsin received the surrender of Iraqi troops during combat operations. This particular Pioneer was later donated to the Smithsonian Institution, and is now on public display. During Operation Desert Storm these Pioneers were operated by detachments of VC-6. In addition to the Pioneer UAVs, the recommissioned Iowas could support six types of helicopters: the Sikorsky HO3S-1, UH-1 Iroquois, SH-2 Seasprites, CH-46 Sea Knight, CH-53 Sea Stallion and the LAMPS III SH-60B Seahawk.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the {{military}} rulers in Burma undertook renovation {{work on the}} Mahamuni Pagoda. During this period, the Mahamuni Buddha image was damaged in 1997 when a hole appeared in <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Image. It was believed that thieves had drilled the hole {{in an attempt to}} steal jewels believed to be secreted within the image. It was reported that a military officer had requested to open the temple in the night, resulting in a meeting of all the senior monks from major monasteries in the area to discuss the matter. Whilst the meeting was in progress, attention was diverted to a purported rape incident committed by a Muslim man on a Buddhist girl. A major riot broke out but it turned out afterward that the Buddhist girl had not been raped at all. It was a coverup to divert attention away from the Buddha so it could be repaired. However, the mystery remains as to whether any jewellery did exist and was actually removed from the Great Image at all.|$|E

40|$|Five {{muscle fibre}} types (I, IIc, IIa, IIx and IIb) {{were found in}} the suprahyoid muscles (mylohyoid, geniohyoid, and <b>the</b> {{anterior}} and posterior <b>bellies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digastric) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rat using immuno and enzyme histochemical techniques. More than 90 % <b>of</b> fibres in <b>the</b> muscles examined were fast contracting fibres (types IIa, IIx and IIb). The geniohyoid and <b>the</b> anterior <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digastric had <b>the</b> greatest number <b>of</b> IIb fibres, whilst the mylohyoid was almost exclusively formed by aerobic fibres. <b>The</b> posterior <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digastric contained a greater percentage of aerobic fibres (83. 4 %) than <b>the</b> anterior <b>belly</b> (67. 8 %). With <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geniohyoid, <b>the</b> percentage <b>of</b> type I and IIc fibres, which have slow myosin heavy chain (MHCβ), was relatively high and greater than has been previously reported in <b>the</b> jaw-closing muscles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rat, such as the superficial masseter. The geniohyoid and mylohyoid exhibited a mosaic fibre type distribution, without any apparent regionalisation, although in the later MHCβ-containing fibres (types I and IIc) were primarily located in the rostral 2 / 3 region. In contrast, <b>the</b> anterior and posterior <b>bellies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digastric revealed a clear regionalisation. In <b>the</b> anterior <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digastric 2 regions were observed: both a central region, which was almost exclusively formed by aerobic fibres and where all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> type I and IIc fibres were located, and a peripheral region, where type IIb fibres predominated. <b>The</b> posterior <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digastric showed a deep aerobic region which was greater in size and where type I and IIc fibres were confined, and a superficial region, where primarily type IIx and IIb fibres were observed...|$|R

It is now almost impossible to ascertain when the various changes in the name were made; but early English travellers and merchants mention the town as Brodera, and it is from this that the name Baroda is derived.
