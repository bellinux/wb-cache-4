5|$|Scotties, {{while being}} {{described}} as very loving, {{have also been}} described as stubborn. They are sometimes described as an aloof breed, {{although it has been}} noted <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to be very loyal to their family and are known to attach themselves to one or two people.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters may be infested {{by several}} blood-feeding flies {{of the genus}} Carnus, and the biting fly Ornithophila metallica. Other parasites include chewing lice of the genera Meromenopon, Brueeliaa and Meropoecus, {{some of which are}} {{specialist}} parasites of bee-eaters, and the stickfast flea Echidnophaga gallinacea. The hole-nesting lifestyle of bee-eaters means <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to carry a higher burden of external parasites than non-hole-nesting bird species. Bee-eaters may also be infected by protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus including H. meropis.|$|E
5|$|Despite being bred for racing, Whippets can be couch potatoes. When {{not running}} around, {{they are usually}} asleep or cuddled in their owner's lap. They are not prone to {{fighting}} but {{have been known to}} chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. They also have a tendency to get up on furniture. Whippets are touch sensitive, meaning <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to their}} {{geographic}} concentration, it is noted <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> {{to be isolated}} and had an insular culture. As a result, <b>they</b> also <b>tended</b> to be very late in their adoption of the English language and of western culture in general. The insular culture and resultant intermarriage {{can result in a}} high degree of consanguinity amongst Vathimas.|$|R
5|$|The Gaelic Revival of {{the early}} twentieth century has had a {{long-term}} influence. There is now an extensive network of urban Irish speakers (Gaeilgeoirí) in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin and Belfast. They represent an expanding demographic, with their own schools (called Gaelscoileanna) and their own social media. It has been argued <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to be more highly educated than monolingual English speakers, with better employment prospects and higher social status. Recent research suggests that urban Irish is developing in a direction of its own, both in pronunciation and grammar. Irish is also taught in mainstream English-speaking schools as a compulsory subject, but has been criticised for its ineffectiveness.|$|E
5|$|The nectar of the ﬂowers {{is sought}} after by insects, bellbirds, tūī and stitchbirds. The leaves and the rough bark provide {{excellent}} homes for insects such as caterpillars and moths, small beetles, ﬂy larvae, weta, snails and slugs. Many {{of these are}} then eaten by birds such as saddlebacks and robins. The rough bark also provides opportunities for epiphytes to cling and grow, and lizards hide amongst the dead leaves, coming out to drink the nectar and to eat the insects. Good flowering seasons occur every few years only. While {{it is said that}} they foretell dry summers, it has been observed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to follow dry seasons.|$|E
5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E

In fact, they found it so useful <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> to see ‘trouble’ everywhere, particularly Pedagogical trouble, which refers to the lesson management breaking down or the lesson not unfolding as expected.|$|R
40|$|Mature {{students}} are often {{said to be}} deficient in study skills, but a recent literature review by Richardson concluded <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> to exhibit more desirable approaches to learning. Using a shortened form of the Approaches to Studying Inventory, a comparison between 38 mature and 60 non-mature students taking the same course found indeed that the mature students obtained significantly higher scores on meaning orientation, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> also <b>tended</b> to produce lower scores on reproducing orientation. In addition, {{in terms of both}} their persistence and their attainment, the subsequent academic performance of the mature students on their degree courses was at least as good as that of the non-mature students...|$|R
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} methods of classifying musical instruments. Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the instrument, {{the means by which}} music is produced with the instrument, the range of the instrument, and the instrument's place in an orchestra or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group. The problem with these specialized classification schemes is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to break down once they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize Hornbostel-Sachs as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each instrument. The most common types of instrument classifications are strings, brass, woodwind, and percussion.|$|E

25|$|Several other {{performance}} evaluation {{models in the}} academic literature also describe performance measurement. What distinguishes performance paradox from these other models is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to restrict their scopes either to explanations for changing performance criteria or to endorsements of maximizing on a specific, defined set of static criteria. Performance paradox alone predicts that maximizing {{on a set of}} predictably shifting criteria generates positive outcomes for organizations, most accurately describing most actual organizations' behavior.|$|E
50|$|The novel Freedom Road {{is based}} on a true story and was made into a 1979 film {{starring}} Muhammad Ali, who, in a rare acting role, played Gideon Jackson, an ex-slave in 1870s Virginia who is elected to the U.S. Senate and battles other former slaves and white sharecroppers to keep the land <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> all their lives.|$|R
60|$|As {{the days}} and weeks pussed, Saxon was possessed by a {{conscious}} feeling of proud motherhood in her swelling breasts. So essentially a normal woman was she, that motherhood was a satisfying and passionate happiness. It was true that she had her moments of apprehension, but they were so momentary and faint <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended,</b> if anything, to give zest to her happiness.|$|R
50|$|Koyré was {{suspicious}} of scientists' claims to prove natural or fundamental truths through experiments. He argued these experiments {{were based on}} complicated premises, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> to prove the outlook behind these premises, rather than any real truth. He repeatedly critiqued Galileo's experiments, claiming {{that some of them}} could not have taken place, and brought into question the results Galileo claimed and which modern historians of science had hitherto accepted.|$|R
25|$|There is {{a massive}} junior and youth {{contingent}} of rugby league players in St Helens. Clubs such as Thatto Heath and Blackbrook Royals have produced many of the former and current superstars in St Helens' squads over the years, and continue to do so. Clubs in the St Helens area also include Bold Miners, Portico Vine, Pilkington Recs, Haydock Warriors, Newton Storm, Eccleston Lions and Haresfinch Hawks which provide players for St Helens through the junior years and the scholarship schemes at the club, before eventually signing professionally at 16. But St Helens' youth roots do not stop in the St Helens area. Indeed, club legend Keiron Cunningham signed for the club from Wigan St Judes, and Saints also look to clubs like Wigan St Patricks and Orrell St James in the Wigan area, and Halton Farnworth Hornets in the Widnes area for youth talent. However, a criticism of the St Helens scouting system is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> {{not to look at}} players beyond the junior ages (6–16 years old), and talented players who continue into amateur rugby tend to be signed very rarely.|$|E

500|$|A {{common problem}} with the scripts, {{according}} to Novak, is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to run too long for the regular 22-minute time slot, leading to several cuts. For example, the script for the episode [...] "Search Committee" [...] was initially 75 pages—10 pages too long. A complete script is written for each episode; however, actors are given opportunities to improvise during the shooting process. Fischer said, [...] "Our shows are 100 percent scripted. They put everything down on paper. But we get to play around a little bit, too. Steve and Rainn are brilliant improvisers." [...] This leads to {{a large number of}} deleted scenes with almost every episode of The Office, all of which are considered part of the show's canon and storyline by Daniels. Deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the bonus footage. In an experiment, a deleted scene from [...] "The Return" [...] was made available over NBC.com and iTunes, explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes. Daniels hoped that word of mouth among fans would spread the information, but eventually considered the experiment a failure.|$|E
5000|$|Contemporary theory treats Bloch as the Clausewitz of {{the early}} 1900s. A review in 2000 in the journal War in History [...] {{concentrates}} on the interaction between Bloch's theory and the military professionals of the time. In short, it finds <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> to dismiss Bloch, on the basis that, while his [...] "mathematics" [...] might be correct, his overall message ran {{the risk of being}} bad for morale.|$|R

2500|$|The {{problem with}} these {{dictionaries}} was <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> {{to be little}} more than poorly organised and poorly researched glossaries of [...] "hard words": words that were technical, foreign, obscure or antiquated. But perhaps the greatest single fault of these early lexicographers was, as historian Henry Hitchings put it, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> [...] "failed to give sufficient sense of [...] language as it appeared in use." [...] In that sense Dr. Johnson's dictionary was the first to comprehensively document the English lexicon.|$|R
2500|$|Part of {{the reason}} Cyanea are able to grow tall stalks is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to grow in deep forest, often in narrow gulches on the older islands, where there is little wind.

2500|$|Ash bricks {{have been}} used in house {{construction}} in Windhoek, Namibia since the 1970s. There is, however, a problem with the bricks in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to fail or produce unsightly pop-outs. This happens when the bricks come into contact with moisture and a chemical reaction occurs causing the bricks to expand.|$|E
2500|$|Although the plasmid methods avoid viruses, {{they still}} require cancer-promoting genes to {{accomplish}} reprogramming. The other main issue with these methods is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> {{to be much}} less efficient compared to retroviral methods. Furthermore, transfected [...] plasmids [...] {{have been shown to}} integrate into the host genome and therefore they still pose the risk of insertional mutagenesis.|$|E
30|$|In case B, each {{developer}} {{had already}} before the planning defined tasks, which {{were considered to}} be included in the iteration. In the planning, the tasks were gone through and it was decided how much of them could be implemented in the iteration timeframe. A challenge in the planning meetings was <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> sometimes to include great amount of technical discussion, which was not relevant to everyone and prolonged the meeting.|$|R
40|$|Two recent {{papers in}} Science [1, 2] suggest that infants well under {{a year old}} can learn from {{exposure}} to relatively short samples of language-like sequences of syllables. The first of these two papers, by Saffran and colleagues [1], suggested that infants were sensitive to the statistical structure of syllable sequences <b>that</b> <b>they</b> heard, in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> to listen longer to syllable sequences that were less common in their brief experience.

2500|$|Some {{research}} suggests that the unemployment effects of small minimum wage increases are dominated by other factors. In Florida, where voters approved an increase in 2004, a follow-up comprehensive study after the increase confirmed a strong economy with increased employment above previous years in Florida and better than in the US as a whole. When it comes to on-the-job training, some believe the increase in wages is taken out of training expenses. A 2001 empirical study found that there is [...] "no evidence that minimum wages reduce training, and little evidence <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to increase training." ...|$|E
