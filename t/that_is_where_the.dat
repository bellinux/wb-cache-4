5|$|Electrons are {{identical}} particles because they cannot {{be distinguished from}} each other by their intrinsic physical properties. In quantum mechanics, this means that a pair of interacting electrons {{must be able to}} swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system. The wave function of fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped; <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> , <b>where</b> <b>the</b> variables r1 and r2 correspond to the first and second electrons, respectively. Since the absolute value is not changed by a sign swap, this corresponds to equal probabilities. Bosons, such as the photon, have symmetric wave functions instead.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, the Ecuadoran flag still shares some {{similarity}} {{with the}} flags of Colombia and Venezuela. All three flags use the yellow, {{blue and red}} tricolor, but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> similarities end. In a decree passed in Colombia in 1934, {{the ratio of the}} stripes were set at 2:1:1 and the flag ratio was set at 2:3, similar to the present Ecuador flag. However, the coat of arms is only changed {{in the middle of the}} flag when it is used by government officials or by military forces. For Venezuela, the basic design was to have all three strips even vertically, unlike those of Colombia and Ecuador. Since 1863, Venezuela decided to change their flag with white stars instead of a coat of arms. A coat of arms was not added to the national flag 1954, then changed again in 2006 to add another star and alter the coat of arms. The position of the coat of arms on the Venezuelan flag also differs from Ecuador and Colombia by placing the arms at the very top hoist (left) side of the flag instead of in the center.|$|E

25|$|In {{the poem}} Lalla Radha and the Churel, a priest warns the protagonist to not go near the Peepul trees because <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Churel lives {{and she might}} take him away and kill him.

Blinded by his desire, he did not notice that while he lay with her, his body seemed to get frailer until he died in a state of ecstasy. In The Female Element in Indian Culture, it says, “The Churel runs after and seeks to possess every man whom she meets, for, it is said, her carnal {{appetite}} remains unsatisfied in life”. She also possesses girls during dances, causing a trance. According to Persian legend, when travelers saw the tracks of a Churel in the dirt they would try to flee by heading in the opposite direction, but her reversed feet would inevitably lead them right into her grasp. The Patari and Majhwar think that she appears to take her victims to the mountains and {{the only way they can}} be freed is if a goat is sacrificed.|$|E
25|$|Boranes react {{rapidly to}} alkenes {{in a process}} called hydroboration. This concept was {{discovered}} by Dr. Herbert Charles Brown, work for which he eventually received the Nobel Prize (jointly with Georg Wittig for his discovery of the Wittig reaction). Although diborane as a pure compound is a dimer, BH3 forms 1:1 complexes with basic solvents, for instance THF. In an ordinary electrophilic addition reaction of HX (X = Cl, Br, I, etc.), Markovnikov's rule, which states that the less electronegative atom, usually hydrogen, adds to the least substituted carbon of the double bond, this determines regioselectivity. With boranes the mode of action is the same, the hydrogen adds to the most substituted carbon because boron is less electronegative than hydrogen. When a positive charge develops in the alkene on the most substituted carbon atom, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> partially negatively charged hydrogen atom adds, leaving the least substituted carbon atom for the boron atom. The so-called anti-Markovnikov addition because when the boron is replaced with a hydroxyl group the overall reaction is addition of water over the double bond in {{what appears to be}} an anti-Makovnikov addition.|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} and head writer Russell T Davies {{came up with}} the concept of [...] "The Unquiet Dead". As the third episode of the revived series, it was designed to continue to show the range of the programme by exploring the past, after the contemporary [...] "Rose" [...] and far-future [...] "The End of the World". The episode also reintroduces the TARDIS' habit of taking the Doctor to the wrong places, something that had not yet happened in the revived series. Davies felt that it was important for an episode to be set in Cardiff as <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> new series is produced, and wanted the story to be set in Victorian times and feature Charles Dickens. Davies' original brief also included [...] "fake mediums", and Gatiss originally set it in a [...] "spiritualist hotel", which had fake mediums (such as a character named Mrs Plumchute) on the lower floors and Mr Sneed on the top, though he was unaware he was a true medium. However, Gwyneth became a more popular character with the production team, and she took on much of the medium role. Gatiss was also more interested in possession and zombies. Mrs Sneed was another character that was cut out of the episode; Gatiss believed she was unnecessary as Gwyneth was the [...] "heart" [...] of the story.|$|E

Misinformed by their then-current mixing engineer, Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals.

500|$|Srimanthudu {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu called Srimanthudu a [...] "star-driven film {{with a strong}} plot that's worth a watch".

The reviewer appreciated Siva for not writing a separate comedy track to distract from the story. Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "You could say this movie is Mahesh Babu's Swades (the 2004 SRK film) albeit a little dumbed down. Or a Mirchi (the Prabhas film) rehashed. Yet there can be no denying that Srimanthudu achieves more than any big ticket Tollywood potboiler has in more in that last decade , {{for the simple reason that}} it is a drama made like one." [...] Sethumadhavan N of the Bangalore Mirror rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Make no mistake, Srimanthudu is certainly a big commercial entertainer and has most of the elements needed for the same. But to deliver a total commercial which doesn't have a great plot and yet remaining engaging all the way isn't easy at all. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> writing by Siva emerges triumphant." [...] Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Though there are a few hiccups, Srimanthudu is a good emotional drama with excellent performance by Mahesh Babu, supported by good content with neat dialogues". Hemanth Kumar C.R. of Outlook India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and stated, [...] "In an industry where weaving a story to suit the image of an A-list star is common, Mahesh Babu's latest, Srimanthudu, takes a different course. The film might lack a big-starrer firepower, but by letting go of such conventions, what we get in the end is a sensible film full of heart and humanity." [...] IndiaGlitz rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and called Srimanthudu a [...] "family entertainer with mass appeal, thanks to Mahesh's understated acting" [...] and added, [...] "Koratala Shiva doesn't really unleash a Mirchi-fied Mahesh Babu even in the second half. All throughout, the billionaire Srimanthudu maintains his composure even when he has to turn into a 'hanthakudu'. Things are so understated that the fight-to-finish itself looks half-done." ...|$|E
