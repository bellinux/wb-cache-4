25|$|I {{really do}} not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have homosexuals guiding our children. I think that it’s a {{lifestyle}} that I don’t agree with. I realize {{a lot of people}} do. It’s my personal faith, religious faith, that I don’t believe that the people who do this should be raising our children. It’s not a natural thing. You need a mother and a father. You need a man and a woman. That’s what God intended.|$|E
2500|$|Bush {{administration}} Press Secretary Dana Perino stated {{just after}} the incident that “I saw the reports about the school. I don’t have any information about that. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not jump to conclusions and we should wait {{to find out what}} the evidence says... What we do know is that Hamas often hides amongst innocents and uses innocent people, including children, as human shields." ...|$|E
2500|$|Likud party {{spokesperson}} Zalman Shoval said in March 2007 that Israel {{would never}} accept {{the return of}} refugees {{who had lived in}} pre-1967 Israeli territory, saying [...] "If 300,000–400,000, or maybe a million, Palestinians would invade the country, {{that would be the end}} of the state of Israel as a Jewish state.... That's not why we created the state." [...] Prime Minister Ehud Olmert also stated that month that [...] "I'll never accept a solution that is based on their return to Israel, any number.... I will not agree to accept any kind of Israel responsibility for the refugees. Full stop.... It's a moral issue of the highest level. I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> accept any kind of responsibility for the creation of this problem." [...] In general, however, Olmert has described the initiative as a [...] "revolutionary change".|$|E
40|$|Like William James before him, Huw Price has influentially {{argued that}} truth has a {{normative}} {{role to play}} in our thought and talk. I agree. But Price also <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> regard truth-conceived of as property of our beliefs-as something like a metaphysical myth. Here I disagree. In this paper, I argue that reflection on truth's values pushes us in a slightly different direction, one that opens the door to certain metaphysical possibilities that even a Pricean pragmatist can love...|$|R
5000|$|In August 2014, she {{expressed}} {{her belief}} that China could invade Australia: [...] "If anybody <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{have a national}} security and defence policy, which ignores {{the threat of a}} Chinese Communist invasion - you're delusional and got rocks in your head ... The Communist Chinese military capacity and level of threat to the western world democracies is at an unprecedented and historical high." [...] Her comments incurred a rebuke from the Premier of Tasmania Will Hodgman. She later added Indonesia as a potential military threat.|$|R

2500|$|Obama {{has said}} that the death penalty is used too {{frequently}} and inconsistently. However, he favors it for cases in which [...] "the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage." [...] Speaking as a state senator about the Illinois legislature's constant additions to the list of factors that render a defendant eligible for the death penalty, Obama said, [...] "We certainly don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> [...] have this laundry list that does not make any distinctions between the run-of-the-mill armed robbery that results in death and systematic killings by a terrorist organization. And I think essentially what the reduction of aggravating factors does is, it says, 'Here's a narrower set of crimes that we think potentially at least could deserve the death penalty.'" [...] In his own words, [...] "While the evidence tells me that the death penalty does little to deter crime; I believe there are some crimes – mass murder, the rape and murder of a child – so heinous that the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage by meting out the ultimate punishment. On the other hand, the way capital cases were tried in Illinois at the time was so rife with error, questionable police tactics, racial bias, and shoddy lawyering, that 13 death row inmates had been exonerated." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{has indeed}} been a {{wonderful}} escape," [...] Frank said, [...] "and I <b>think</b> now <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be ungrateful indeed if {{every one of us}} did not fervently thank God for having preserved us." ...|$|R

[...] "Well now, I do <b>think,</b> messmates, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> ax the mate to make a note o' that in the log, for it's not often that Tom Lokins takes to thinkin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{it is not}} fancy," [...] Mr. Welch replied, [...] "and I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all be deceived, it is {{an attack}} upon Gloucester." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It answers Hartley's description. After all, I don't <b>think</b> it's {{extraordinary}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{have taken}} {{so much trouble}} to push on past the right place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has promised}} to cut my head off likewise," [...] said Ascelin. [...] "Earl, knights, and gentlemen, do you not <b>think</b> it wiser <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> lay our wits {{together}} once and for all, and cut off his." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot but <b>think,</b> master, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{have done}} better if you had given your parole {{not to try to}} escape. In <b>that</b> case <b>we</b> might have had {{comfortable}} quarters in the town instead of this somewhat bare chamber. If there had been a chance of escape it would have been different, but seeing the strength of the castle, methinks there is no prospect whatever of our being able to get out." ...|$|R

60|$|The bare {{idea of this}} is {{no doubt}} horribly repulsive to us, {{but at the same}} time I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{remember}} how repulsive our carnivorous habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit.|$|E
6000|$|... "You can {{go where}} you choose," [...] she said. [...] "You {{can come back}} to Mrs. Towsley's, if you like, but I tell you frankly <b>that</b> except while <b>we</b> are on {{business}} I <b>think</b> it better <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> stay apart." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{following}} {{very short}} letter therefore was written. [...] "My dear Cecilia, {{as you will}} not come to me at Perth, I must go to you at Exeter.

6000|$|... "Why {{that would}} depend upon how my {{business}} turned out,--and that would {{depend upon the}} weather, and the markets, and other things which we can not now foresee. I <b>think</b> it probable <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have a good deal over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I saw {{you last}} in London," [...] said Phineas, {{with a voice}} that was gruff, and a manner that was abrupt, [...] "I {{certainly}} did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> meet again so soon." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this brief paper is to trace {{the origin of the}} {{so-called}} “comparative” suffix in Tungusic languages. Although traditionally seen as a Pan-Tungusic element (only lost in Manchuric), there are very good reasons to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> actually <b>we</b> <b>should</b> deal with two different morphemes whose distribution roughly speaking corresponds to the one between the Northern and Southern (Amuric) Tungusic languages. I aim to offer evidences pointing to a possible Mongolic -Northern Tungusic contact situation as well as an independent genesis in Southern Tungusic. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place," [...] he said, [...] "mixed {{up with the}} Ternate people are all the natives of this island, and to exterminate them would be to leave us without labor, and to ruin the island. In the next place, the havoc which has been already wrought in our {{plantations}} is such {{that it will take}} years to repair; and the longer this fighting goes on, the more complete will be the destruction. I <b>think,</b> then, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> grant them the easiest terms possible. They will be only too glad to escape, and to get back to their own land, and will be long before they invade us again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> it best <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> meet quietly," [...] the {{merchant}} said, as they shook hands. [...] "I know the Ghentois, how greedily they swallow every rumour, how they magnify the smallest things, {{and how they}} rage if their desires are not gratified, and give themselves wholly up to the demagogues.

6000|$|... 'Just as you like, father; {{it seems}} to me that I would rather fight than be robbed; but as {{everyone}} seems to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be certainly beaten I am willing to agree to anything you wish.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Does not {{my father}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> go?" [...] asked Cheenbuk, {{who began to}} feel uneasy as a fresh burst of flame {{set fire to the}} canvas awning, and made the place they stood on unpleasantly hot.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{have much}} {{difficulty}} in determining that,' said I; 'with your permission {{we will take}} the first train down to Sussex, and go a little more deeply into the matter upon the spot.' ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked in}} April 2011 {{whether he would}} wish to meet the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill, Shevchuk said that [...] "I would like very much to visit him and hold a {{personal}} meeting with him. I am convinced that in peacefully and openly communicating with each other, we can relieve any tension ... I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> today, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> heal the wounds rather than irritate and deepen them. One can heal the wounds of our memory only with mutual forgiveness. Therefore, as for any our brethren or neighbors who wounded us or were wounded by us, {{the best way to}} communicate is to be open in a brotherly dialogue, be open to the purification of our memory, to ask for forgiveness and to forgive".|$|R
60|$|They answered, 'We {{know not}} what we shall do; we did not <b>think</b> once <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have been such traitors to Shaddai as we have proved to be. What, then, shall we say to our Lord? Let him put no trust in his saints; let the Prince dwell in our castle, and make of our town a garrison; let him set his noble captains and his warlike {{soldiers}} over us; yea, let him conquer us with his love, and overcome us with his grace, and then surely shall he be but with us, and help us, as he was and did that morning that our pardon was read unto us. We shall comply with this our Lord, and with his ways, and fall in with his word against the mighty.|$|R
30|$|As we have seen, when Haraway {{retrieves}} {{a notion}} {{like that of}} location for her idea of situated knowledge, she {{is at the same}} time exposing, via Withehead, “the fallacy of misplaced concreteness” that lies at the core of either traditional realism or of traditional representationalism, both being based on an ontological distinction between representations and reality as well as on the existence of a distant and invisible representer (Haraway 1991; Barad 2007 : 46 ff.). So, Barad’s belief in the dynamism and articulation of matter, which is not “a support, location, referent, or source of sustainability for discourse” or any other external force inscribing onto it, but “always already an ongoing historicity” (Barad 2003 : 821), is not so different from Haraway’s faith in the historical embeddedness of figurations. It is worth repeating that Haraway never abandons representations nor opposes diffractions to them. If Barad <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> leave representations behind decisively for “matters of practices/doings/actions” (ibid.: 802), Haraway is saying that seeing too is a doing and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are responsible for the generativity of our visual practices (Haraway 1991). Accordingly, Barad, when discussing the functioning of scanning tunnelling microscopes (STM), which not only allow the visualization of but also the manipulation of atoms, notes that representations do not depict static objects out there, but are rather “condensations or traces of multiple practices of engagement” (Barad 2007 : 53). Representations are performed as well as performing, so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> rather talk about a set of representational practices <b>that</b> produce “what <b>we</b> take to be the evidence” (ibid.); our belief in them depends on historical and cultural variables, so that critically engaging with representations is always possible and, according to Haraway, also desirable (see also Barad 2007 : 49). Only when they are critically engaged are metaphors put in motion, that is, activated through a process of translation, becoming effective, dynamic figurations rather than remaining reflective depictions of static givens.|$|R
