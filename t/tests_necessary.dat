50|$|A {{persistent}} trigeminal artery {{is associated}} with an increased risk of aneurysm, though some studies have suggested that this finding may be an effect of selection bias, as most individuals do not undergo the <b>tests</b> <b>necessary</b> to identify the condition. Persistent trigeminal artery has been identified as a rare cause of trigeminal neuralgia, with 2.2% prevalence of persistent trigeminal artery among trigeminal neuralgia patients. Surgery to move the persistent trigeminal artery away from the trigeminal nerve has been successful in treating the trigeminal neuralgia in some cases. In some cases, presence of a persistent trigeminal artery concurs with hypoplasia of the basilar artery, in which case the internal carotid artery is responsible for most blood flow to the upper pons, cerebellum, midbrain, and parts of the temporal and occipital lobes, meaning that anything disrupting blood flow in the internal carotid artery could lead to ischemia in these regions. In addition, persistent trigeminal artery has been associated with vertebrobasilar insufficiency, brainstem ischemia, and carotid cavernous fistulae.|$|E

5000|$|Together with Clinton Frazier, a {{mathematician}} and colleague at Sikorsky, Doman left Sikorsky after WW II to further {{develop and implement}} his ideas. [...] Doman-Frazier Helicopters, Inc. {{was established in the}} autumn of 1945. [...] The company was initially located {{in the back of a}} law office in New York City, but soon moved into a barn in Stratford, Connecticut, not far from the Sikorsky plant. [...] With financial assistance from the United States Army Air Corps, Doman obtained a war surplus R-6 Sikorsky helicopter. [...] Doman and his engineering team modified the R-6 by creating an entirely new rotor system which featured a unique gimbaled rotor hub that was subsequently used in all Doman helicopters. [...] After extensive successful flight testing of the modified Sikorsky R-6 (Doman LZ-1A), Doman’s team designed and built, in a joint venture with the Curtiss-Wright Corp., an all-new Doman helicopter, the CW-40. [...] The CW-40 was followed a couple of years later by the Doman LZ-5/YH-31. [...] The many innovative features in this helicopter were soon covered by numerous Doman patents. [...] Meanwhile, after the departure of Mr. Frazier, the company was renamed Doman Helicopters, Inc. and moved to Danbury, CT. [...] Doman Helicopters continued for nearly 20 years, building and testing several helicopters and performing other related aircraft work to sustain the company while it attempted to establish itself as a major helicopter manufacturer. [...] The Doman LZ-5/YH-31 helicopters were extensively tested by the company and by the U.S. Army and Navy. [...] They received certification from the United States FAA, and from the equivalent Canadian authority, for sale and commercial use, after passing the rigorous <b>tests</b> <b>necessary</b> for such approvals. Doman LZ-5/YH-31 helicopters toured the U.S. and were well received by potential customers, especially in the oil industry along the Gulf Coast. One even toured in France and Italy performing at the Paris Air Show in 1960.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} bad signature identi-cation in batch verication of digital signatures. The number of generic <b>tests</b> <b>necessary</b> to identify all bad signatures in a batch instance, is {{used to measure the}} eciency of veriers. The divide-and-conquer veri-er DCV (x; n) is dened. The verier identies all bad signatures in a batch instance x of the length n by repeatedly splitting the input into sub-instances. Its properties are investigated. In particular, probability distributions for the number of generic <b>tests</b> <b>necessary</b> to identify one, two and three bad signatures, are derived. The average numbers of GT <b>tests</b> <b>necessary</b> to identify bad signatures ranging from 1 to 16 are ob-tained from computer simulation. Further, a Hamming verier (HV) is de ned which allows to identify a single bad signature in a batch of the length n = 2 k 1 using k+ 2 tests. HV is generalised into the two-layer Hamming verier (2 HV). Given a batch instance of the length 2 k 2, the 2 HV verier identies a single bad signature using k + 2 tests and two bad signatures in expense of 3 k+ 3 tests. The work is concluded by comments about a general model for verication codes identifying t bad signatures and the design of veriers using combinatorial structures. ...|$|E
