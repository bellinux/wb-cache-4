50|$|A simple, {{and highly}} effective, {{technique}} {{to protect the}} occupants of a wheeled vehicle is to fill the <b>tires</b> <b>with</b> <b>water.</b> This will {{have the effect of}} absorbing and deflecting the mine's blast energy. Steel plates between the cabin and the wheels can absorb the energy and their effectiveness is enhanced if they can be angled to deflect it away from the cabin. Increasing the distance between the wheels and cabin, as is done on the South African Casspir personnel carrier, is an effective technique although there are mobility and ease of driving problems with such a vehicle.|$|R
40|$|Trial {{tests and}} {{container}} observations {{were conducted in}} households to verify the residual effect of temephos in Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil. Three plastic buckets, three tin cans, and three <b>tires</b> filled <b>with</b> <b>water</b> from an artesian well and larvicide {{were used in the}} experiment, with twenty-five third-instar larvae, which remained exposed for 24 h, followed by mortality readings. The same types of containers were selected from common households. Collection and counts followed by chemical treatment were carried out on the larvae that were found. Follow-up was performed weekly to verify recolonization by Aedes aegypti. The experiment showed 100 % mortality in the plastic buckets until day 90, and 80 % in the tin cans until day 30, decreasing from day 45 onwards. Mortality in the tires decreased to 35 % in the first month. Household results showed 100 % mortality for all containers after 24 h and differentiated values in the subsequent readings. Larvae were observed on day 35 in a tin can and on day 21 in a gallon can. There was a large diversity of results in the <b>tires,</b> <b>with</b> recolonization observed from day 7 onwards...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of alpha-cypermethrin (Cyperthor®) and lambda-cyhalothrin (Demand®) to prevent mosquito larval colonization of water-containing receptacles was investigated using 2 differing applications in disused car tires in Darwin, Australia. Insecticide treatments were applied uniformly {{to the inside}} surfaces of 2 categories of tires: 1) dry tires that were partially filled <b>with</b> <b>water</b> 24 h after spraying and 2) wet <b>tires</b> partially filled <b>with</b> <b>water</b> prior to spraying. All mosquito larvae, pupae, and dead adults were collected from the treatment and control tires weekly over the 24 -wk study period and were later identified to species in the laboratory. Control tires were colonized by Aedes notoscriptus in wk 2 and by Culex quinquefasciatus in wk 4. Aedes notoscriptus failed to colonize any alpha-cypermethrin–treated tires until wk 22 and did not colonize any lambda-cyhalothrin–treated tires during the 24 -wk trial. Culex quinquefasciatus colonized alpha-cypermethrin– and lambda-cyhalothrin–treated tires from wk 11 and wk 15, respectively. These results indicate both insecticides using either application method can prevent colonization of Ae. notoscriptus for at least 20 wk and demonstrate great potential {{for the prevention of}} breeding in receptacles for other receptacle-breeding Aedes species, such as the dengue vectors, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus...|$|R
5000|$|Sidewall {{deflection}} is not {{a direct}} measurement of rolling friction. A high quality <b>tire</b> <b>with</b> a high quality (and supple) casing will allow for more flex per energy loss than a cheap <b>tire</b> <b>with</b> a stiff sidewall. Again, on a bicycle, a quality <b>tire</b> <b>with</b> a supple casing will still roll easier than a cheap <b>tire</b> <b>with</b> a stiff casing. Similarly, as noted by Goodyear truck <b>tires,</b> a <b>tire</b> <b>with</b> a [...] "fuel saving" [...] casing will benefit the fuel economy through many tread lives (i.e. retreading), while a <b>tire</b> <b>with</b> a [...] "fuel saving" [...] tread design will only benefit until the tread wears down.|$|R

Foram realizados testes experimentais e observações de recipientes nas residências para verificar o efeito residual do temefós em Manaus, Amazonas, Brasil. Na forma experimental, utilizou-se três baldes plásticos, três latas e três pneus, os quais receberam água de poço artesiano e o larvicida. Usou-se 25 larvas de 3 º estádio que ficavam em exposição por 24 horas, seguindo-se a leitura da mortalidade. Selecionou-se os mesmos tipos de recipientes nas residências, realizou-se a coleta e contagem das larvas encontradas, realizando-se o tratamento químico. Semanalmente fazia-se o acompanhamento para se verificar a recolonização por Aedes aegypti. Em condições experimentais, constatou-se 100 % de mortalidade no balde plástico até 90 dias do experimento, na lata 80 % até o 30 º dia, reduzindo-se a partir do 45 º dia. Os pneus apresentaram queda na mortalidade para 35 % no primeiro mês. Nas residências, observou-se 100 % de mortalidade em todos os recipientes após 24 horas e resultados diferenciados nas leituras seguintes. Na lata, verificou-se larvas no 35 º dia e no galão no 21 º dia. Nos pneus, ocorreu grande diversidade de resultados observando-se recolonização a partir de sete dias...|$|R
5000|$|Using a {{technique}} {{which has never}} been duplicated, the streambed of the Eiskanal canoe slalom channel was made of sculpted concrete, with simulated boulders being {{an integral part of}} the uneven channel floor. This feature is easily seen in photographs of the channel without water. The shapes were planned using water flowing through a 25-meter-long scale model made of sheet metal. [...] Most of the simulated boulders are attached to the channel walls, but two stand alone in the middle of the channel. Five barn-door <b>water</b> <b>deflectors,</b> hinged to the channel sides, can be swung in or out to change the water flow at those locations.|$|R
5000|$|T-80 (1976): Initial model, with 1,000-hp {{gas turbine}} engine, {{coincidence}} rangefinder, and no missile capability. This model {{does not have}} fittings for explosive reactive armor. The turret is from the T-64A, and thus retains {{the use of the}} old coincidence rangefinder. Characteristics of this type are the V shaped <b>water</b> <b>deflector</b> on the front glacis, coincidence rangefinder in front of the commander's cupola, and Luna searchlight mounted in the same position as a T-64. Around 250 were produced, as the tank's armour was essentially obsolete when introduced. Turret vs APFSDS - 380 mm, Hull vs APFSDS - 500 mm (without reactive armor). Was in effect a pre-production model. Reportedly was fitted with an early version of the Shtora APS.|$|R

Where the channel narrows and drops at the pedestrian bridge is Bogenbrücke, or Arch Bridge. It has a pair of hinged <b>water</b> <b>deflectors</b> to further narrow the channel, if desired. The rock island below the bridge is called Moby Dick, after the fictional whale. At the last of the hinged deflectors, on the left wall, the right half of the channel is a pour-over. The wave at the pour-over is called Korkenzieher, or Corkscrew. The turbulent right bend in the channel between there and the road bridge is Karussell, or Carousel. Another pour-over wave under the bridge, on the left side, is called Torpedowalze, or Torpedo Hole. After the road bridge, the course flattens out, and racers sprint to the finish line.|$|R
