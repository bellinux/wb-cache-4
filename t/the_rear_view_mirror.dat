25|$|It was {{a police}} car version of the Gallardo LP560-4 coupé for the Italian State Police, with a camera {{recording}} system featuring a camera beside <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror,</b> GPS navigation, a gun holster, a police radio, a Paletta warning sign, a portable screen, a refrigerator and defibrillator in the front cargo compartment, blu Polizia body colour, a police beacon with blue LEDs at the vehicle's front, roof, side, and rear.|$|E
25|$|On May 10, 2008, the Japanese-spec Legacy can {{be fitted}} with a new {{collision}} avoidance feature, called EyeSight. It consists of twin CCD cameras, {{one on each side}} of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror,</b> that use human-like stereoscopic vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs on the driver. The system can help maintain a safe distance on the highway, a lane departure warning system, a driver alert warning for various safety situations, and even keeps an eye out for pedestrians. SI-Cruise has been integrated into the EyeSight feature as a driver safety aid.|$|E

For instance, <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> of <b>the</b> [...] "Series 2" [...] CX were found on many - mostly British - sports cars, like the Lotus Esprit, the Jaguar XJ220, the TVR Chimera and the (French) MVS Venturi.|$|R
25|$|The video {{begins with}} a small boy and girl playing on a {{playground}} together, teasingly pushing each other around. The young girl {{is intended to be}} Clarkson as a child, presumably with her young male best friend. The boy hands her a beaded necklace, which she puts on admiringly. The shot closes in on the necklace, then pulls back to reveal it's still worn as a bracelet on the wrist of now-adult Clarkson, her boyfriend (played by Houston Rhines) shows up at her apartment door, presumably after an argument. Clarkson teases him with a set of keys, which she then throws down the toilet. The two are then shown sitting on a couch, reading magazines, when Clarkson grabs her boyfriend's magazine. The two are shown throwing various possessions of one another out of the apartment window, though in a playful manner. Such items include numerous articles of clothing, magazines, a guitar (which Clarkson tries to stop him throwing out), and a fishbowl (with the fish being taken out and put in a glass first, after which they look out the window). After throwing these items out the window, the two are seen sitting affectionately on the couch. Clarkson and her boyfriend are shown still fighting and bickering as they did as children, over the TV Guide and remote control. The latter portion of the video shows the two driving in a first generation Ford Bronco (with the necklace/bracelet hanging from <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror),</b> eventually getting into an argument. Distracted by the tiff over directions, the Bronco nearly ends up in a head-on collision with an approaching car. After spinning out to avoid the crash, Clarkson simply grabs her boyfriend and pulls him into a kiss, where the video ends.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the video, {{whenever}} Meat Loaf {{sings the}} line [...] "Objects in <b>the</b> <b>Rear</b> <b>View</b> <b>Mirror</b> May Appear Closer Than They Are", he sees either the ghost of the plane, the woman or himself when he was younger. As with the lyrics, the sequence depicts how, as Allmusic says, [...] "he still feels haunted by their memory." ...|$|E

50|$|Toyota {{had adopted}} a McLaren MP4-22-like bridge {{on the front}} wing, and have also moved <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> outboard, like Ferrari and Renault. The TF108 had also had a major focus on {{cleaning}} the air flow around the front suspension, maximising the zero keel concept of the front suspension.|$|R

50|$|The R27 is {{outwardly}} {{similar to}} the 2006 R26, with several aerodynamic modifications. The front wing design, for example, is very {{similar to the}} R26's. One unusual new feature is the placing of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> on <b>the</b> strakes on outer edge of the sidepod, following a concept introduced by Ferrari on their 2006 car (the 248 F1).|$|R
500|$|The album's sixth track, [...] "Objects in <b>the</b> <b>Rear</b> <b>View</b> <b>Mirror</b> May Appear Closer than They Are" [...] is a {{three part}} {{narrative}} that uses pathetic fallacy, where the seasons (summer, winter and spring) reflect {{the atmosphere of}} the events being described, drawing [...] "its inspiration from the singer's often-tragic childhood.

500|$|... "Objects in <b>the</b> <b>Rear</b> <b>View</b> <b>Mirror</b> May Appear Closer Than They Are" [...] {{is a song}} {{composed}} {{and written}} by Jim Steinman, and recorded by Meat Loaf. The song was released in 1994 as the third single from the album [...] and it reached #38 on US's Billboard Hot 100, and #26 in the UK Top 40. With its chart success, this song became the hit with the longest un-bracketed title [...] The title {{is derived from the}} safety warning on car side mirrors in the US, [...] "Objects in mirror are closer than they appear".|$|E
500|$|... "Objects in <b>the</b> <b>Rear</b> <b>View</b> <b>Mirror</b> May Appear Closer Than They Are" [...] is {{a three-part}} narrative, centred upon the seasons summer, winter and spring. According to Allmusic, it draws [...] "its {{inspiration}} from the singer’s often-tragic childhood. The lyrics portray {{a man who has}} overcome tragedies in his life yet still feels haunted by their memory." [...] BBC.co.uk also says that the song about a [...] "melancholy middle-aged man reminiscing about his youth... is in many ways uncomfortably close to home, dealing as it does with episodes uncannily similar to events in his own life." [...] Steinman says that it was [...] "the hardest song to write and get across." ...|$|E
40|$|Every {{automobile}} has <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{and side}} <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{to make it}} easier for the driver to look at <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> side of <b>the</b> vehicle easily. They help the driver in moving the vehicle backwards without anyone's assistance. Usually, <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> are located at the top of the windscreen and they are adjustable according to the position and viewing angle of the driver. During night times, the light from the head lights of the vehicle behind is reflected and falls directly on the eyes of the driver. This light reflection from <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> causes a strain on our eyes and results in our eyes becoming tired and drowsy, consequently results in lack of alertness and can result in an accident. People who drive for more than 100 miles during the night experience this type of strain in their eyes. This can be avoided by reducing the reflection of light from the side <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> by implementing the process of electro chromism in the mirrors. By means of this process, we will be introducing a glass that changes the intensity of reflection when a voltage is applied...|$|R
2500|$|Common {{places to}} mount such beacons include on {{or in the}} grill of the vehicle and {{on the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirrors,</b> where they can gain maximum visibility. [...] In the UK many {{emergency}} vehicles have lights {{on the side of the}} bonnet, which helps to warn oncoming traffic when pulling out of junctions. [...] These lights are often strobe or LED types, as they have the lowest profile for purposes of attachment.|$|R

500|$|The {{songs of}} Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness are {{intended}} to hang together conceptually, with {{the two halves of}} the album representing day and night. Despite this, Corgan has rejected the term concept album to describe it, and it was at the time described as more [...] "loose" [...] and [...] "vague" [...] than the band's previous records. However, Billy Corgan has also said that the album is based on [...] "the human condition of mortal sorrow". Corgan aimed the album's message at people aged 14 to 24 years, hoping [...] "to sum up all the things I felt as a youth but was never able to voice articulately." [...] He summed up by stating, [...] "I'm waving goodbye to me in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror,</b> tying a knot around my youth and putting it under the bed." ...|$|E

Filming {{took place in}} Los Angeles County, California in July 1993; the opening chase was filmed at Chávez Ravine, with the interior mansion scenes filmed at Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills. The cinematographer was Daniel Pearl, particularly known for filming The Texas Chain Saw Massacre in 1973. Pearl says that this video [...] "is one of my personal all-time favorite projects... I think the cinematography is pure, and it tells {{a story about the}} song." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first [...] "500" [...] {{was held}} at the Speedway on Decoration Day (as Memorial Day was known from its {{inception}} in 1868 to 1967 when Federal Law made Memorial Day the official name), May 30, 1911, run to a [...] maximum engine size formula. It saw a field of 40 starters, with Harroun piloting a Marmon Model 32-based Wasp racer — outfitted with his invention, <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror.</b> Harroun (with relief from Cyrus Patschke) was declared the winner, although Ralph Mulford protested the official result. 80,000 spectators were in attendance, and an annual tradition had been established. Many considered Harroun to be a hazard during the race, as he was the only driver in the race driving without a riding mechanic, who checked the oil pressure and let the driver know when traffic was coming.|$|E
5000|$|Like the Callaway C12, {{the only}} body panels the car retains from the C6 are the roof panel, <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> hatch, and <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirrors.</b> <b>The</b> engine is a 6.2-liter (378 cu in) Callaway {{modified}} LS3 V8, powered by an Eaton supercharger with air/liquid intercooler integral to intake manifold.

40|$|From 1975 to 1979, 173 {{persons in}} The Netherlands died, {{because they were}} {{hit by a car}} turing right, which is 1, 5 % {{of the total number of}} fatalities.

Though <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> are fixed according to EEC directives they leave large areas invisible for the drivers of the trucks. Some seem to have additional mirrors, but there are no national data on this. When trucks turn right or left they need a wider lane. Trucks without a <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> (80 %) mostly have only one person in the cabin, the driver. All these factors leave a wide area not visible for the drivers of trucks when turning right.

40|$|A {{recent study}} (Cavallo and Pinto, 2012) showed that {{daytime running lights}} (DRLs) on cars create “visual noise” that interferes with the {{lighting}} of motorcycles and affects their visual conspicuity. In the present experiment, we tested three conspicuity enhancements designed to improve motorcycle detectability in a car-DRL environment: a triangle configuration (a central headlight plus two lights located on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirrors),</b> a helmet configuration (a light located on the motorcyclist’s helmet {{in addition to the}} central headlight), and a single central yellow headlight. These three front-light configurations were evaluated in comparison to the standard configuration (a single central white headlight). Photographs representing complex urban traffic scenes were presented briefly (for 250 ms). The results revealed better motorcycle-detection performance for both the yellow headlight and the helmet configuration than for the standard configuration. The findings suggest some avenues for defining a new visual signature for motorcycles in car-DRL environments...|$|R
