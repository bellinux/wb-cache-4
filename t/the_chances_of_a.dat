Many Federalists, who had previously opposed a Bill of Rights, now supported the Bill {{as a means of}} silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective criticism. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing that the Bill's adoption would greatly lessen <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second constitutional convention, which they desired. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.|$|E

5|$|In early March 1944, Parkinson became {{temporary}} {{major general}} and {{commander of the}} 2nd New Zealand Division after its nominal commander, Howard Kippenberger, was wounded. At the time, the New Zealanders, {{as part of the}} New Zealand Corps, were participating in the Battle of Monte Cassino. An offensive, largely planned by Kippenberger and involving the division, began on 15 March. Parkinson, already doubting <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful outcome, failed to follow Kippenberger's directions for dispersion of his troops and did not allow sufficient infantry to enter Monte Cassino immediately following an intensive air bombardment. Although later criticised for being overly cautious during the battle, he was awarded a bar to his DSO for his leadership during this time.|$|E

5|$|More {{effective}} tactics {{had to be}} used {{if there}} were to be no greater resources for the Command. Two major changes adopted by Coastal Command were sweeps over convoy routes and sweeps against U-boat transit routes. According to German and Italian submarine logs, both were effective and denied them the chance of shadowing convoys on the surface. It also rapidly increased <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> kill. The transit tactic over the Bay of Biscay resulted in many air-to-air and air-to-submarine combats, reaching its peak in 1943. As it was, in 1940 the Command was credited with just two sinkings with Navy vessels, one sunk unaided, and two damaged. The damaged ships could have been sunk had proper weapons been available.|$|E
5|$|On March 27, the Russians {{received}} {{word about the}} earlier disastrous defeat at Wschowa. Peter I realized that <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> combined attack on Charles were now minimal. He ordered Ogilvy to attempt {{an escape from the}} encirclement at Grodno and a retreat towards Brest-Litovsk. Ogilvy carried out the order on April 4 and managed to break out unseen with his reduced army, leaving 8,000 men behind at Grodno who had died of starvation and sickness. Another 9,000 men were lost during the retreat as the Swedes pursued the Russians as far as Polesia, where they finally gave up the chase. Mazepa met a similar defeat, as he sent 4,700 men in an attempt to save the Cossacks trapped inside Lyakhavichy. Instead these were annihilated in the battle of Kletsk on April 30, after which the garrison in Lyakhavichy surrendered to the Swedes on May 12 and the fortress was destroyed. In total, almost 10,000 Cossacks were killed, out of the initial 14,000 who actively participated in the campaign.|$|E
5|$|With an Ebola {{epidemic}} devastating West Africa, Burwell began holding daily {{meetings on}} July 28, 2014, {{as part of}} the efforts of the United States government, including the Department of HHS, to prevent further spread of the disease. Starting on September30, other Obama administration officials began giving daily public briefings while Burwell took less of a public role, although she did take part in a number of public meetings. In the fall of 2014, the first known death from Ebola in the United States occurred. The Obama administration proposed devoting $6billion to fight the spread of Ebola, including $2billion for the State Department and USAID. The plan included provisions to help U.S. hospitals become better prepared and to support global health initiatives aimed at containing the disease in Africa. Congress allocated $5.4billion to fight Ebola in response to the Obama administration request. Burwell and other Obama administration officials sought to assure the public that the American health system was prepared to deal with Ebola cases and that <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> full outbreak in the United States were low.|$|E

5|$|In June, {{predictions}} from CSU and TSR {{were similar}} to pre-season forecasts due to the a lack of an El Niño and warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic Ocean. However, by July and August, CSU and TSR all adjusted their forecasts downward because of predictions of cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures and above-average wind shear. NOAA also decreased the amount of activity in its final outlook, despite predicting a wetter-than-average western Africa and above-average sea surface temperatures in its report. On June3, CSU issued its first mid-season prediction {{for the remainder of}} the year. In its report, the organization continued to predict well above-average activity, with eighteen named storms, nine hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 165 units. CSU stated that there was a 72% chance of at least one major hurricane impacting any stretch of the United States coastline; <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> major hurricane hitting the East Coast and Gulf Coast were 48% and 47%, respectively. The following day, Tropical Storm Risk issued its third forecast for the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season, calling for sixteen named storms, eight hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE of 134 units; this activity was predicted to be roughly 30% above the 1950–2012 long-term mean. TSR gave a 65% probability that the landfalling ACE index would be above-average. A month later, TSR lowered its numbers to 15named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. On August2, Colorado State University issued another update for the season, lowering its numbers slightly. However, the organization continued to state that there was an above-average probability of a United States and Caribbean major hurricane landfall. Finally, on August8, NOAA issued its second and final outlook for the season, predicting 13 to 19 named storms, six to nine hurricanes, and three to five major hurricanes; these numbers were down slightly from its May outlook.|$|E

30|$|When {{working on}} a problem, humans can have an “eureka” moment when they glimpse the problem solution. An eureka moment {{typically}} occurs when people combine facts {{in a new way}} to solve a problem. Continuous education loads more facts into participants’ minds and may increase <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eureka moment. Technology can also increase <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eureka moment by explicitly managing the juxtaposition of facts presented to the solvers. More eyes on <b>a</b> problem increases <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> uncovering key insights, especially if technology presents the problems in new contexts. Because of this, technological solutions that continuously teach solvers new facts and combine those facts in new ways can improve <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eureka moment. Technology may increase the odds of this, but insight only occurs in the human mind.|$|R

40|$|In this article, I {{argue that}} {{emerging}} economies are systematically becoming {{more susceptible to}} both currency and banking crises after financial liberalisation (FL). Using data for 27 emerging economies from 1973 to 1998, univariate and multivariate analyses indicate that the likelihood of currency crises and banking crises increase after FL. In particular, liberalisation allows more liquidity to enter an emerging economy, which finds its way into productive and speculative projects. What is common to both types <b>of</b> crises is <b>a</b> significant increase in speculative financing, thereby increasing <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> for borrower default. Thus, the outflow of international capital becomes more likely. <b>The</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crisis occurring in response to changes in short-term loans is greater after FL than before. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> currency crisis occurring following a currency overvaluation is larger after FL than before. In comparison, the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>a</b> banking crisis occurring {{in response to an}} overvalued currency remains the same. Finally, the results show that <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> currency crisis declines over time, while <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> banking crisis increases after FL. emerging economies, financial liberalisation, currency and banking crises, speculative financing, currency overvaluation,...|$|R
