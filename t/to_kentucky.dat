Walton, Tyler's cousin, had played for Michigan State. He received an official offer from Kentucky on August 16. In early September, Ulis announced that he would not take an official visit to USC and had eliminated them from consideration.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Caroline affair, President Harrison died and Vice-President John Tyler ascended to the presidency. Tyler {{resisted}} Clay's attempts {{to set the}} Whig agenda, and vetoed two bank bills against Crittenden's advice. Crittenden and the other Whigs in Tyler's cabinet—excepting Daniel Webster—resigned in protest of Tyler's deviation from the traditional Whig agenda. Crittenden's resignation was effective September 11, 1841. He returned <b>to</b> <b>Kentucky</b> with no political office and very little money. A group of his friends in Woodford County purchased his boyhood home and presented it {{to him as a}} gift on his return <b>to</b> <b>Kentucky.</b>|$|E

5|$|Stories {{were told}} of Boone making one last visit <b>to</b> <b>Kentucky</b> {{to pay off}} his creditors, {{although}} {{some or all of}} these tales may be folklore. American painter John James Audubon claimed to have gone hunting with Boone in the woods of Kentucky around 1810. Years later, Audubon painted a portrait of Boone, supposedly from memory, although skeptics have noted the similarity of this painting to the well-known portraits by Chester Harding. Boone's family insisted he never returned <b>to</b> <b>Kentucky</b> after 1799, although some historians believe Boone visited his brother Squire near Kentucky in 1810 and have therefore reported Audubon's story as factual.|$|E
5|$|The {{terms of}} Buckner's parole in Shreveport, Louisiana, on June 9, 1865, {{prevented}} his return <b>to</b> <b>Kentucky</b> for three years. He remained in New Orleans, {{worked on the}} staff of the Daily Crescent newspaper, engaged in a business venture, and served on the board of directors of a fire insurance company, of which he became president in 1867. His wife and daughter joined him in the winter months of 1866 and 1867, but he sent them back <b>to</b> <b>Kentucky</b> in the summers because of the frequent outbreaks of cholera and yellow fever.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>Kentucky,</b> {{accepting the}} pastorate of First Presbyterian Church of Lexington. His return <b>to</b> <b>Kentucky</b> was also {{motivated by a}} growing fondness for his cousin, Virginia Hart Shelby, who had cared for two of his children during his stay in Pennsylvania. Virginia was the widow of Alfred Shelby, the son of Isaac Shelby, who was twice governor of Kentucky. Their written exchanges included love poems from Robert and concerned questions from Virginia {{about the wisdom of}} engaging in a relationship. Despite being advised by her sisters to avoid the marriage and her own wavering on the issue, the two were married in April 1847. They had three children, only one of whom survived to adulthood. Disagreements among the children of both partners' previous marriages exacerbated an already tense union, which almost ended in divorce in September 1856. Robert managed to reconcile with his wife, and they remained together until Virginia's death in 1859.|$|E
