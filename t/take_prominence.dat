Both prisons {{are located in}} Gotham and while Blackgate is the main correctional facility used by writers today, Gotham State Penitentiary was the primary correctional facility used in the comics up until the early 1990s. According to modern continuity, in the early 1990s, Blackgate Prison was condemned by Amnesty International and forced to shut down. When the prison eventually re-opened, it was officially known as [...] "Blackgate Penitentiary". Because of its secure location on a secluded island, Blackgate began to <b>take</b> <b>prominence</b> over Gotham State, until the latter became virtually unused.|$|E

50|$|By and large, the 1970s {{represented}} {{a period of}} growth in Canada-Latin America relations that produced episodes of incredible significance and garnered tremendous potential for future relations. Importantly, the emerging distinctiveness of Canada on the global stage (in an increasingly multi-polar international system) was particularly visible in relations with Latin America. In radical deviation from the policies and ideological attitudes of the United States, Canada pursued policies of tolerance and acceptance with respect to Latin American states. Canadian tolerance was evident throughout the 1970s - with the acceptance of thousands of leftist Chilean refugees between 1970 and 1980, opposition to various American political interventions in South America, or Trudeau’s tour of Mexico, Venezuela, and Cuba in 1976. New notions of trans-hemispheric integration/relations began to <b>take</b> <b>prominence</b> as Canada found itself involved in Latin American affairs in a meaningful way.

5000|$|In {{his first}} public speech after Egypt's defeat at {{the hand of the}} Israel, Sadat's {{predecessor}} Abdul Nasser called for religion to play a more important role in society. The line is said to have drawn `an exceptionally enthusiastic roar of applause` by the Egyptian audience, and three years later when the 1970s began, religiosity was ascendant in Egypt (as in much of the Muslim world). Beards on men and hijab on women became more popular. Religious programs appeared on state TV and radio. Islamic preachers (such as Sheikh Muhammad Metwally Al Shaarawy) began to <b>take</b> <b>prominence</b> as symbols of popular Egyptian culture. [...] Novels, plays, science-fiction, philosophy books singing the praises of Islam, often by converts from secularism. (An example being My Itinerary from Doubt to Belief, an autobiography by a very popular Egyptian writer, Dr. Mustafa Mahmud, who had formerly been a staunch believer in scientific positivism, human engineering, and materialism. Another prominent ex-secularist convert was Khalid Muhammad Khalid.) The revival led to greater attendance in prayer and growth of non-state-controlled neighborhood mosques, but also to at least some conflict with the minority Coptic Christians of Egypt, an example being Islamist castigation of Muslim participation in the all-Egyptian spring holiday Sham el-Nessim. The picnicking festival, which has pre-Islamic roots, was attacked as a means for bringing about the `destruction of Islam in Egypt.`" ...|$|E
5000|$|Rock {{and roll}} music {{collapsed}} after New Year's Day 1961, when Reverend Jimmy Swaggart led a march against a Madison Square Garden rock festival; the three-day Rock and Roll Riots left many major stars dead or crippled, and Nixon branded the {{music as a}} severe moral threat, leading to moral standards being placed on the American industry. More 'moral' music like Pat Boone and the [...] "English Invasion" [...] - Ken Dodd, Matt Monro, and Valerie Singleton - took over. Britain is still dominated by this type of music, with groups like the John Lydon Band and their patriotic hit God Save the Queen. Russian [...] "Sovrock", inspired by bootleg tapes of rock music, would <b>take</b> <b>prominence</b> and lead the USSR to cultural dominance, with singers like Andrei Tarkovsky becoming international stars. As a result, Elvis Presley rejoined the army in 1961 and remained there until 1989, then leaving to become a Sanctioned Op defending the Deep South; very few people outside of the USSR and Japan remember his music career, while Elvis has a recurring nightmare of himself an obese self-parody of his former self, unable to remember the music. The Beatles never formed; years later, when Elvis was bodyguarding John Lennon MP, Lennon would remark that he might've stayed with music if Elvis had not retired (a twist on their real-life meeting).|$|E

40|$|Growing {{international}} {{interest in the}} early childhood years {{has been accompanied by}} an expansion of public programs in Australia targeting young children and their families. This article explores some of the influences and rhetoric that frame these initiatives. It encourages critical examination of the discourses that shape the nature of early childhood programs in Australia and identifies a range of barriers that inhibit the involvement of early childhood teachers in the design and delivery of social policy initiatives for young children. As the imperatives of programs seeking to overcome social disadvantage <b>take</b> <b>prominence</b> in Australian early childhood policy initiatives, pedagogical perspectives that promote universal rights to more comprehensive early childhood experiences can easily be silenced. The article calls for pedagogical leadership to overcome these barriers and promote the democratic rights of all children to high-quality and publicly supported early childhood education and care programs. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Virtual {{teams are}} {{becoming}} a natural phenomenon {{in most of the}} organizations. There are many reasons in present day, which are leading for formation of these teams. Even though there are challenges to make these teams work effectively, some advantages <b>take</b> <b>prominence</b> over the challenges. This paper explores one of the important challenges among global virtual teams – 2 ̆ 2 Trust 2 ̆ 2. Trust could be a challenge in any type of team. It could also be a potential advantage for any team if they can achieve and retain this factor among team members. Virtual teams work with variations in location, culture and time. It is more difficult in virtual teams to overcome the trust challenge. This paper discusses the analysis on Trust in virtual teams with integrating case studies. The reflection of this paper opens up areas that would require future research. Importance and fragility of trust is illustrated in different stages of virtual team. The paper also investigates the elements like communication and coordination might facilitate the trust in global virtual teams.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} electronic health record (EHR) initiatives at the national/external level. Governments are investing large amounts of money in national EHR systems. These systems are socially and politically complex and a variety of stakeholders (e. g. at the individual, organisational or national level) have an interest in evaluating such systems from technical, economic or patient outcome perspectives. In cognisance of academic research in the area, this paper presents an approach which uses the perspective of one particular type of professional critic, the media, to identify issues and evaluate their impact at a national level. Design/methodology/approach – The work is conducted using an established evaluation framework and formal content analysis of selected relevant articles from the quality press of three selected countries. Findings – Different issues <b>take</b> <b>prominence</b> in centralised vs decentralised EHR approaches. In countries with a decentralised approach issues of standards and interoperability take the fore. Where there is a more centralised approach the media focus is more on project management, budgetary and financial aspects. In all coverage political and economic aspects are emphasised over technical or patient outcome issues. Originality/value – The paper represents the application of the content-context-process framework. It contributes to the information systems evaluation literature at the national/external level...|$|E

[...] Dept. of Sociology. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2010. This thesis explores the rituals that reinforce American capitalist consumerism, specifically {{focusing on the}} Christian holiday calendar structure. Major Christian holidays are viewed as complex sets and repeated patterns, involving inversions and binary oppositions. A structuralist analysis is applied to explore the role of Black Friday as a new consumer holiday in a larger symbol set [...] one that reveals the reinforcement of underlying values and practices of consumerism. The structural comparison {{of the meaning of}} Fat Tuesday and Ash Wednesday as the inauguration of Lent as a season of non-consumption is compared to Thanksgiving and Black Friday as the inauguration of a season of consumption and shopping during Advent. Seen from a structural viewpoint, new consumer holidays <b>take</b> <b>prominence</b> in practice, re-defining seasons in relation to consumption, that previously had been defined by civil religious structure and meaning. The re-definition of civil religion as consumer civil religion, and implications for related social theories are discussed.

40|$|Public {{acceptance}} {{is crucial}} for successful implementation of energy technologies in society. However, studies that use the concept do so in diverse and often inconsistent ways. They also often limit themselves to specific technologies and do {{not account for the}} effects of labeling, time, and the heterogeneity of the general public, which may lead to a biased and incomplete understanding of public acceptance. This study first conceptualizes three forms of public acceptance: socio-political acceptance, market acceptance and community acceptance. It then relates the concept of socio-political acceptance to preference formation. Next, it uses two discrete choice experiments that were conducted in 2010 and 2012 to investigate these concerns. Our results show that public preferences for energy technologies are temporally stable, {{even in the face of}} exogenous shocks such as the Fukushima incident. Using mixed logit models, we further show that labeling has a profound influence on stated preferences. When technology labels are revealed, respondents favor renewable and natural gas technologies. When labels remain unobserved, nuclear energy and biomass <b>take</b> <b>prominence.</b> However, latent class models show that there are distinct classes of respondents, tied to specific socio-demographic characteristics that differ greatly in their sensitivity to labeling and in the temporal stability of their preferences. It follows that changes in public acceptance are not population-wide, but remain limited to specific sub-groups. We discuss the theoretical and policy implications of our findings and conclude that future studies and policy initiatives may overlook important insights if they disregard the effects of labels, time, and heterogeneity...|$|E
