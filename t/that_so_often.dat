500|$|Though his {{cartoons}} {{have continued}} to thrive, Bengough's life and career as a writer has drawn far less attention. [...] Bengough biographer Stanley Paul Kutcher considered his poetry [...] "undistiguished". [...] Historian George Ramsay Cook commended Bengough's approach to have [...] "nurtured the growth of social criticism in late Victorian Canada without much of that humourless self-righteousness <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> characterizes reformers".

500|$|Specifically, Enough Said {{was praised}} for its {{commitment}} to realism, both in the way Holofcener's characters converse and in the themes the film addresses. In a review for The New York Times, A. O. Scott claimed that [...] "Line for line, scene for scene, {{it is one of}} the best-written American film comedies in recent memory." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt that Enough Said demonstrated [...] "Holofcener's gift for portraying life as it is lived", while David Denby, writing for The New Yorker, wrote that it [...] "approaches novelistic richness".

Rather, they disappear into the vulnerable and self-doubting characters they play without a hint of the preening vanity <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> causes cinematic performances to seem forced and shallow." ...|$|E

The work is {{critical}} of the [...] "grandstanding" [...] <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> surrounds Baartman: as Awerbuck has explained, [...] "Saartjie Baartman is not a symbol. She is a dead woman who once suffered {{in a series of}} cruel systems. The best way we can remember her is by not letting it happen again." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Canada {{reporters are}} {{similarly}} allowed to witness defendants {{being brought to}} court in restraints, and photograph it. However, Ryerson University journalism professor Lisa Taylor says that such activities, were they undertaken deliberately to shame or humiliate a defendant, could lead to [...] "a legal claim for abuse of legal process".

2500|$|Not all satire riffing on dril is {{political}} in nature; for example, the account @drilmagic attracted thousands of followers presenting mashups of dril tweets and cards {{from the game}} [...] Ben Wilinofsky, a card player who contributed to @drilmagic, said the account and its format became a success because [...] "Magic has a very self-serious lore that is great foil for an account <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> has the self-serious in its crosshairs." ...|$|E
