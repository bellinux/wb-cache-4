25|$|Attenuation {{in fiber}} optics, {{also known as}} <b>transmission</b> <b>loss,</b> is the {{reduction}} in intensity of the light beam (or signal) as it travels through the transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation {{is an important factor}} limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the attenuation and maximizing the amplification of the optical signal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Present study {{efforts have}} been made to apply a {{mathematical}} model to be able to simulate flow through ephemeral rivers and the purpose is to study the effect of <b>transmission</b> <b>losses</b> on the time base of hydrographs and the time of their peak discharge and also the effect of bridges on <b>transmission</b> <b>losses</b> and the time base of hydrographs in the Khoshk River system, which is an ephemeral river, by applying MIKE 11. Structures such as bridges in the seasonal rivers affect flow characteristics in different ways. Two scenarios are defined to be simulated applying MIKE 11. First scenario: Computing the <b>transmission</b> <b>losses</b> in the Khoshk River system without any bridges; Second scenario: Computing the <b>transmission</b> <b>losses</b> in the Khoshk River system with bridges and their influences on the flow characteristics. Flow analysis in the Khoshk River system as an ephemeral river would be carried out by the one-dimensional numerical model by solving the fully dynamic wave model for the two mentioned scenarios and their related scenarios and the results will be compared with some observed data. As a result, the effect of bridges on <b>transmission</b> <b>losses</b> and the time base of hydrographs would be answered quantitatively.

40|$|Dynamic {{economic}} dispatch (DED) problem considering prohibited operating zones (POZ), {{ramp rate}} constraints, <b>transmission</b> <b>losses</b> and spinning reserve constraints {{is a complicated}} non-linear problem which is difficult to solve efficiently. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) method is proposed to solve such a DED problem. Firstly, a novel MILP formulation for DED problem without considering the <b>transmission</b> <b>losses,</b> denoted by MILP- 1, is presented by using perspective cut reformulation technique. When the <b>transmission</b> <b>losses</b> are considered, the quadratic terms in the <b>transmission</b> <b>losses</b> are replaced by their first order Taylor expansions, and then an MILP formulation for DED considering the <b>transmission</b> <b>losses,</b> denoted by MILP- 2, is obtained. Based on MILP- 1 and MILP- 2, an MILP-iteration algorithm (MILP-IA) is proposed to solve the complicated DED problem. The effectiveness of the MILP- 1 and MILP-IA are assessed by several cases and the simulation results show {{that both of them}} can solve to competitive solutions in a short time.

In the context of competitive electricity marketplace, the costs caused by <b>transmission</b> <b>losses</b> should be reasonably allocated to various market participants, but the nonlinearity of the <b>transmission</b> <b>losses</b> function makes the allocation very difficult. In this paper, the concept of 'conductor renting' is proposed {{for the first time and}} is used to solve <b>transmission</b> <b>losses</b> allocation problem. The analysis indicates that the active power losses caused by different current components are in proportion to the conductor section acreage and the corresponding conductance used by the current components, and the reactive power losses caused by current components have similar characteristics.

50|$|The STC {{number is}} derived from sound {{attenuation}} values tested at sixteen standard frequencies from 125 Hz to 4000 Hz. These <b>Transmission</b> <b>Loss</b> values are then plotted on a sound pressure level graph and the resulting curve is compared to a standard reference contour. Acoustical engineers fit these values to the appropriate TL Curve (or <b>Transmission</b> <b>Loss)</b> to determine an STC rating. The measurement is accurate for speech sounds, but much less so for amplified music, mechanical equipment noise, transportation noise, or any sound with substantial low-frequency energy below 125 Hz. Sometimes, acoustical labs will measure TL at frequencies below the normal STC boundary of 125 Hz, possibly down to 50 Hz or lower, thus giving additional valuable data to evaluate <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> at very low frequencies, such as a subwoofer-rich home theater system would produce.

Once this radial equivalent network is available, the allocation {{of the cost of}} <b>transmission</b> <b>losses</b> to generators and demands can be performed in a straightforward manner. This equivalent network is derived solving a simple quadratic optimization problem whose solution can be obtained efficiently. A realistic case study including two load scenarios is analyzed.
