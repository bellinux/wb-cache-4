40|$|Abstract Background The {{hard edges}} of adult finger clip probes of the pulse oximetry oxygen {{saturation}} (POOS) monitor can cause skin damage if used for prolonged periods in a neonate. Covering the skin under the probe with Micropore surgical tape or a gauze piece might prevent such injury. The study {{was done to}} see if the protective covering would affect the accuracy of the readings. Methods POOS was studied in 50 full-term neonates {{in the first week of}} life. After obtaining consent from their parents the neonates had POOS readings taken directly (standard technique) and through the protective covering. Bland-Altman plots were used to compare the new method with the standard technique. A <b>test</b> of <b>repeatability</b> for each method was also performed. Results The Bland-Altman plots suggest that there is no significant loss of accuracy when readings are taken through the protective covering. The mean difference was 0. 06 (SD of 1. 39) and 0. 04 (SD 1. 3) with Micropore and gauze respectively compared to the standard method.

40|$|Abstract. In general, in the {{evaluation}} of a <b>test</b> method, the <b>repeatability</b> <b>tests</b> must be performed to establish upper and lower bounds for the precision of a <b>test</b> method. The <b>repeatability</b> is calculated as a standard deviation and relative error of test results. In order to evaluate the repeatability of the workability tests used in self-consolidating concrete (SCC) applications, an SCC mixture proportioned with 0. 38 w/cm, Type MS cement, 480 kg/m 3 of binder, and crushed aggregate with MSA of 12. 5 mm was used. The dosage rate of the HRWRA of the SCC was adjusted to secure two initial slump flow consistency levels of 630 ± 10 mm and 700 ± 10 mm for the <b>repeatability</b> <b>tests.</b> For each consistency level, the concrete was batched five times (for a total of 10 mixtures). Each test was repeated five times by the same operator in order to establish the single-operator precision values. Furthermore, five different operators were used to perform each of the workability tests in order to assess the multi-operator error that could occur during testing. Based on the relative errors obtained in the <b>repeatability</b> <b>tests,</b> relatively low error values were obtained for the slump flow, J-Ring flow, and L-box blocking ratio tests.

In this context, the aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the intra and inter <b>test</b> <b>repeatability</b> of several temporal and spectral indicators using an IMU under constant running conditions. Accelerations were measured using three IMU's mounted on the trunk near the lumbar, the right tibia and the dorsal surface of the right shoe above the metatarsals. The subject follows two different protocols to realize the intra test and the inter <b>test</b> <b>repeatability</b> of eight different parameters: root mean square (RMS) values of acceleration, kurtosis, total energy, median frequency, mechanical stiffness, mean stride duration, contact and flying duration. For all parameters the mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation were computed for each set of test. The coefficient of variation was lower than 5 % for both test for all parameters except kurtosis and the median frequency. Parameters with acceptable value at constant conditions of surface and speed can be used as an indicator to compare several conditions, such as the influence of speed, surface or anthropometry of the subjects...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Incisional hernia {{remains a}} {{frequent}} complication after abdominal surgery associated with significant morbidity and high costs. Animal and clinical studies have exhibited some limitations. The {{purpose of this}} study was to develop an artificial human abdominal wall (AW) simulator in order to enable investigations on closure modalities. We hypothesized that a physical model of the human AW would give new insight into commonly used suture techniques representing a substantial complement or alternative to clinical and animal studies. Methods: The ‘AbdoMAN’ was developed to simulate human AW biomechanics. The ‘AbdoMAN’ capacities include measurement and regulation of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), generation of IAP peaks as a result of muscle contraction and measurements of AW strain patterns analyzed with 3 D image stereo correlation software. Intact synthetic samples were used to <b>test</b> <b>repeatability.</b> A laparotomy closure was then performed on five samples to analyze strain patterns. Results: The ‘AbdoMAN’ was capable of simulating physiological conditions. AbdoMAN lateral muscles contract at 660  N, leading the IAP to increase up to 74. 9  mmHg (range 65. 3 – 88. 3). Two strain criteria were used to assess <b>test</b> <b>repeatability.</b> A test with laparotomy closure demonstrated closure testing repeatability. Conclusions: The ‘AbdoMAN’ reveals as a promising enabling tool for investigating AW surgery-related biomechanics and could become an alternative to animal and clinical studies. 3 D image correlation analysis should bring new insights on laparotomy closure research. The next step will consist in evaluating different closure modalities on synthetic, porcine and human AW. </p...|$|E

Previous studies using fish as models have suggested that social behaviours such as schooling may covary with behavioural lateralization at the population-level.

Two of the species studied (Aulorhynchus flavidus and Gasterosteus aculeatus) were found to express population-level symmetry {{in the direction of}} lateralization whereas one species (Ammodytes hexapterus) showed no indication of population-level lateralization.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Low-resolution nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (LR-NMR) relaxometry is a powerful tool that can be harnessed for characterizing constituents in complex materials. Conversion of the relaxation signal into a continuous distribution of relaxation components is an ill-posed inverse Laplace transform problem. The most common numerical method implemented today for dealing {{with this kind of}} problem is based on L 2 -norm regularization. However, sparse representation methods via L 1 regularization and convex optimization are a relatively new approach for effective analysis and processing of digital images and signals. In this article, a numerical optimization method for analyzing LR-NMR data by including non-negativity constraints and L 1 regularization and by applying a convex optimization solver PDCO, a primal-dual interior method for convex objectives, that allows general linear constraints to be treated as linear operators is presented. The integrated approach includes validation of analyses by simulations, <b>testing</b> <b>repeatability</b> of experiments, and validation of the model and its statistical assumptions. The proposed method provides better resolved and more accurate solutions when compared with those suggested by existing tools. VC 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Concepts Mag...|$|R
