5|$|This is {{the first}} episode of the series in which Sideshow Bob, Reverend Lovejoy, Krusty <b>the</b> <b>Clown,</b> Jimbo Jones, Kearney Zzyzwicz, Dolph Starbeam, Ms. Albright, and Apu Nahasapeemapetilon appear.|$|E
5|$|According to the Mexican authorities, {{the murder}} plot was {{possibly}} {{carried out with}} the collaboration of the Tijuana Cartel because no security measures were taken during the party and because the entrances were {{open to the public}} (when they are usually closed for private events). The investigation was further {{complicated by the fact that}} many of the invitees—fearing for their lives—fled from the scene when Francisco Rafael was killed by <b>the</b> <b>clown.</b> Out of the 80 to 100 attendees, only 20 of them stayed, many of them family members and employees of the banquet hall. When the authorities interrogated those who stayed and asked them whether they had recognized the assassin or any other physical features, none of them were able to give any details. Some stated that they did not even pay attention to <b>the</b> <b>clown</b> when he entered the crime scene, while others stated that they did not even recall exactly what <b>the</b> <b>clown</b> was wearing, remembering only that the assassin was wearing a blue-stripped or purple shirt, a multicolored wig, and a red clown nose.|$|E
5|$|Among more {{negative}} reviews include Jason Hughes of TV Squad, who commented that several jokes in the episode did not work, {{such as the}} reveal that Krusty <b>the</b> <b>Clown</b> has been sleeping with Sideshow Mel's wife for several years, though he did enjoy {{most of the other}} jokes and applauded the development of Nelson's character.|$|E
50|$|By 1966 <b>the</b> Indianapolis <b>Clowns</b> were <b>the</b> last Negro {{league team}} still playing. <b>The</b> <b>Clowns</b> {{continued}} to play exhibition games into the 1980s, but as a humorous sideshow rather than a competitive sport. After many years of operation as a barnstorming team, <b>the</b> <b>Clowns</b> finally disbanded in 1989.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Clowns,</b> {{painted in}} black and white, intercede between dances to provide comic relief, by taunting the crowd and {{mimicking}} the dancers. In the Pueblo culture, <b>the</b> <b>clowns,</b> or koshare, help to depict unacceptable behavior and teach values.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Indianapolis <b>Clowns</b> were a {{professional}} baseball {{team in the}} Negro American League. Tracing their origins back to <b>the</b> 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>Clowns</b> were <b>the</b> last of the Negro League teams to disband, continuing to play exhibition games into the 1980s. They began play as <b>the</b> independent Ethiopian <b>Clowns,</b> joined <b>the</b> Negro American League as <b>the</b> Cincinnati <b>Clowns</b> and, {{after a couple of}} years, relocated to Indianapolis. Hank Aaron was a Clown for a short period, and <b>the</b> <b>Clowns</b> were also one of the first professional baseball teams to hire a female player.|$|R
5|$|Crush {{attacked}} Doink <b>the</b> <b>Clown</b> {{outside the}} ring {{prior to the}} next match. After getting Doink inside the ring, Crush used his strength advantage to overpower Doink. Doink gained the advantage but missed two attacks from the top rope. Crush used more power moves to wear down Doink, and Doink tried to crawl under the ring. Crush forced Doink back into the ring and performed the Cranium Crunch, a head vice submission hold, on Doink. Doink pulled himself to the ropes and broke the hold. Doink hit the referee and knocked him unconscious; {{as a result of}} this staged ref bump, a second Doink <b>the</b> <b>Clown</b> (portrayed by Steve Keirn) was able to interfere. He hit Crush with a prosthetic arm, which enabled the first Doink to win by pinfall when the referee regained consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{went back}} to work for the WWF in 1992 and was given a new fan {{favorite}} character of an easygoing surfing Hawaiian who wore bright neon tights and utilized a new two-handed skull vice finisher called the Cranium Crunch. Crush made his televised debut in WWF under his new character on May 9, 1992 episode of Superstars, defeating Kato. Crush made his first pay-per-view appearance under the gimmick with a win over Repo Man at SummerSlam. Crush then engaged in a feud with Doink <b>the</b> <b>Clown,</b> after he was attacked with a loaded prosthetic arm while confronting <b>the</b> <b>clown</b> about his cruel pranks on children at ringside, which caused Crush to miss the 1993 Royal Rumble. The feud culminated at WrestleMania IX, where Crush lost after a second, identical Doink appeared from underneath the ring and struck Crush with the prosthetic arm. At the first King of the Ring pay-per-view, Crush challenged Shawn Michaels for the Intercontinental Championship, but lost the match after a distraction by Doink.|$|E
5|$|Bam Bam Bigelow's {{feud with}} Doink <b>the</b> <b>Clown</b> {{remained}} unresolved for several months. They {{were in the}} ring {{at the same time}} during the main event of the 1994 Royal Rumble, which was a battle royal-style match. Bigelow attacked Doink and eliminated him from the match. The blow off match came at WrestleMania X, where Doink and his midget sidekick Dink faced Bigelow and his girlfriend Luna Vachon in a mixed tag team match. Bigelow and Vachon won the match to settle the feud.|$|E

They played in Indianapolis from 1944 to 1962. Later, <b>the</b> <b>Clowns</b> featured Toni Stone, the first female Negro League player in history.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Clowns,</b> {{known for}} their comical antics, were a barnstorming team that {{traveled}} to play in small towns. The team became affiliated with Indianapolis in 1944. In 1952, with Hank Aaron on <b>the</b> team, <b>the</b> <b>Clowns</b> won <b>the</b> Negro American League championship. When Aaron joined the major leagues in 1953, <b>the</b> <b>Clowns</b> replaced him with Toni Stone, {{the first woman to}} play in the Negro Leagues.

5|$|Francisco Rafael was celebrating his 64th {{birthday}} {{along with}} his wife, children, and friends at Ocean House, a beachfront banquet hall owned by Hotel Marbella in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur on 18 October 2013. There were about 80 to 100 attendees at the party, including prominent businessmen, politicians, celebrities, and sport figures like former Mexican footballer Jared Borgetti and boxing champion Omar Chávez. The party also hosted a number of musical groups, including banda La Cabeña, El Mariachi de Los Cabos, and the former leading vocalist of Banda El Recodo. At around 8:00p.m. that day, a black-colored SUV entered the private property and parked near {{the entrance of the}} ballroom. In the front seats of the car, according to eye-witness reports, were two men; in the back seat was a man dressed as a clown, who descended from the vehicle and headed towards the door that led to the kitchen. Once inside the ballroom, <b>the</b> <b>clown</b> identified Francisco Rafael {{at the center of the}} room and began to walk towards him. When <b>the</b> <b>clown</b> was about 1m (3.3ft) close, he pulled out a pistol from his costume and shot him point-blank in his head and then several times more as he fell to the ground, killing him on the scene. As the former drug lord lay dead near the entrance, the assassin ran through a rear exit while the attendees yelled, fell to the ground, and hid under the tables. Four more shots were heard outside the ballroom shortly after the attack; according to eyewitnesses, <b>the</b> <b>clown</b> had done this to scare off one of Francisco Rafael's sons, who was chasing him. The suspect then fled the crime scene in the black-colored SUV and headed towards the highway.|$|E

Razor Ramon defeated Shawn Michaels in a Ladder match to resolve an angle {{in which the}} two had argued over the rightful holder of the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Bam Bam Bigelow gained revenge against Doink <b>the</b> <b>Clown,</b> with whom he had been feuding, by teaming with Luna Vachon to defeat Doink and his partner Dink. Randy Savage also settled his feud with Crush by defeating him in a Falls Count Anywhere match.|$|E

5|$|Although Jerry Lawler and Doink <b>the</b> <b>Clown</b> had a storyline rivalry that dated {{back to when}} Doink {{turned on}} Lawler by dumping {{a bucket of water}} on him after SummerSlam 1993, the feud had rarely been {{mentioned}} since then. On the September 10, 1994 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, however, Lawler provoked Doink by popping balloons carried by Doink's midget sidekick Dink. The rivalry soon led to Lawler introducing a midget named Queasy, who dressed like Lawler. Doink and Lawler then introduced many more midgets over the following weeks. An elimination match was booked for Survivor Series, with Lawler, Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy facing Doink, Dink, Wink and Pink.|$|E
