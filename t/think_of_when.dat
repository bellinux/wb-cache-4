25|$|To {{those who}} believe that {{consciousness}} entails something more than behaving in all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as eliminativist, since it denies the existence of qualia and the possibility of philosophical zombies. However, Dennett is not denying the existence of the mind or of consciousness, only what he considers a naive view of them. The point of contention is whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate, whether what we <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>when</b> we speak of perceptions and consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.|$|E

[...] The old definition of what a family is... the nuclear family- no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today, according to many social scientists (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). Thus has arisen the term postmodern family, which is meant to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and child-free couples."- Brian K. Williams, Stacey C.

500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an {{unsurpassed}} episode. It's hard {{to know where to}} start dishing out the praise— Leonard Nimoy's guest appearance, the Monorail song, Marge's narration, the truck full of popcorn..." [...] Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating [...] "It is by far one of the most loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's nothing in this half-hour that doesn't work, and {{no matter how many times}} I watch this episode, it never, ever gets old." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's the one you <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>when</b> you think of a Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are really stupid and self-serving, but if you give them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E

The Western movies provided the most famous examples, as in the numerous films of John Ford. He was especially enamored of Monument Valley.

[...] Bit mouthpieces may be single jointed, double-jointed, [...] "mullen" [...] (a straight bar), or have an arched port {{in the center of}} varying height, with or without joints.

He has written a regular column for Time, for example, and he appeared on Meet the Press on Sunday, January 25, 2015, to talk about a recent column, which pointed out that Islam should not be blamed for the actions of violent extremists, just as Christianity has not been blamed for the actions of violent extremists who profess Christianity. [...] When asked about being Muslim, he said: [...] "I don't have any misgiving about my faith. I'm very concerned about the people who claim to be Muslims that are murdering people and creating all this mayhem in the world. That is not what Islam is about, and that should not be what people <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>when</b> they think about Muslims. But it's up to all of us to do something about all of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Canzone Napoletana is {{what most}} people <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>when</b> they think of Neapolitan music. It {{consists}} of {{a large body of}} composed popular music—such songs as [...] 'O sole mio, Torna a Surriento, Funiculì funiculà, etc. The Neapolitan song became a formal institution in the 1830s through the vehicle of an annual song writing competition for the yearly Festival of Piedigrotta, dedicated to the Madonna of Piedigrotta, a well-known church in the Mergellina area of Naples. The winner of the first festival was a song entitled Te voglio bene assaie; it was composed by the prominent opera composer, Gaetano Donizetti. The festival ran regularly until 1950 when it was abandoned. A subsequent Festival of Neapolitan Song on Italian state radio enjoyed some success in the 1950s but was eventually abandoned as well. The period since 1950 has produced such songs as Malafemmena by Totò, Indifferentemente by Mario Trevi and Carmela by Sergio Bruni. [...] Although separated by some decades from the earlier classics of this genre, they have now become [...] "classics" [...] in their own right. (See main article for more information.) ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 10, 1961, Combs {{appropriated}} $50,000 {{from the}} governor's contingency fund {{to construct the}} clock on the lawn of the state capitol. Combs had seen a similar clock in Edinburgh, Scotland, and believed it would be a colorful addition to the capitol grounds. When construction was completed on the clock, some ridiculed it as [...] "Combs' Folly" [...] or [...] "Big Bert" [...] (an allusion to London's Big Ben). Combs' political foe, A. B. [...] "Happy" [...] Chandler, was particularly critical, declaring [...] "It's amazing what some people will <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>when</b> they have nothing better to do." [...] In a subsequent gubernatorial campaign, Chandler mocked the clock, declaring [...] "Well, they don't say it's half past 2 in Frankfort anymore. They say it's two petunias past the jimson weed." [...] Chandler's derision became the minority view in time, however; according to journalist John Ed Pearce, the clock {{became one of the most}} talked-about and visited tourist attractions in the state and the most visited place in Frankfort.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} lake {{district is}} the largest geographic region, and it is perhaps what most foreigners <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>when</b> they imagine Finland. The district is bounded to the south by the Salpausselkä Ridges. Behind the ridges extend networks of thousands of lakes separated by hilly forested countryside. This landscape continues {{to the east and}} extends into Russia. As a consequence, there is no natural border between the two countries. Because no set definition of what constitutes a lake and no procedures for counting the number of lakes exist, it has been impossible to ascertain exactly how many lakes the region has. There are, however, at least 55,000 lakes that are 200 or more metres wide. The largest is Lake Saimaa, which, with a surface area of more than , is the fifth largest lake in Europe. The deepest lake has a depth of only the depth of the average lake is [...] Because they are shallow, these many lakes contain only slightly more water than Finland's annual rainfall. The hilly, forest-covered landscape of the lake plateau is dominated by drumlins and by long sinuous eskers, both glacial remnants.|$|E
