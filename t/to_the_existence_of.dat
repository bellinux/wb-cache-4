5|$|In November 1657, a major {{cheating}} scandal erupted {{during the}} Shuntian provincial-level examinations in Beijing. Eight candidates from Jiangnan {{who were also}} relatives of Beijing officials had bribed examiners {{in the hope of}} being ranked higher in the contest. Seven examination supervisors found guilty of receiving bribes were executed, and several hundred people were sentenced to punishments ranging from demotion to exile and confiscation of property. The scandal, which soon spread to Nanjing examination circles, uncovered the corruption and influence-peddling that was rife in the bureaucracy, and that many moralistic officials from the north attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> southern literary clubs and to the decline of classical scholarship.|$|E
5|$|In Roman Britain Cumbria was the {{territory}} of the Carvetii. As the site of the western part of Hadrian's Wall, it was of strategic importance.

5|$|Operationally, the NHC {{immediately}} classified {{the system}} as Tropical Storm Earl based on a Hurricane Hunter Reconnaissance mission that found flight-level winds of 49mph (79km/h), corresponding to surface winds of 40mph (65km/h). Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> multiple circulation centers, the initial movement of the storm was uncertain, but forecasters anticipated a general northward movement. In post-season analysis, {{it was determined that}} the system intensified into Tropical Storm Earl while located about 575miles (925km) south-southwest of New Orleans. Initial advisories on Earl relocated the center of circulation several times before focusing on the true circulation center.|$|E
5|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> {{official}} continental {{football in}} South America, Atlético Mineiro had played against foreign clubs since 1929, and toured Europe in 1950.

Atlético Mineiro then debuted in the inaugural editions of the Copa CONMEBOL, in 1992, of the Copa de Oro, in 1993, and of the Copa Master de CONMEBOL, in 1996. Its first and only appearance in the Copa Mercosur was in the 2000 season, and its debut at the Copa Sudamericana was in 2003, the first time Brazilian clubs had participated.

5|$|The Reds {{have won}} the World Series {{championship}} five times, in 1919, 1940, 1975, 1976 and 1990. Dutch Ruether was the Reds' Opening Day starting pitcher in 1919, Derringer in 1940, Don Gullett in 1975, Nolan in 1976 and Browning in 1990. The Reds won all five Opening Day games in seasons in which they won the World Series. In addition, prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> the modern World Series, the Reds won the American Association championship in 1882.

5|$|The breed {{became more}} popular still {{following}} the French Revolution and the aftermath in which hunting {{was no longer}} restricted to the nobility. Although spread throughout France, a large concentration was located in the north west where the weather resistant coat of the breed made it ideal for the wooded and swampy conditions. During the early 19th century, British hunters crossed the channel to hunt in the grounds of north west France. The British brought their own hunting dogs, and {{this resulted in a}} change of preference as French hunters switched to English breeds and caused a major blow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> the Picardy Spaniel. In addition the infusion of blood from the English Setter into the local spaniel population created the Blue Picardy Spaniel.|$|E

5|$|Until the 1970s Crucibulum {{was thought}} to be monotypic, {{containing}} the single species C.laeve (formerly C.vulgaris). This was in part due to the stance that Curtis Gates Lloyd and other mycologists had taken in the early 20th century, believing that the designation of new species was not justifiable due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> intermediate forms in similar habitats and close proximity. In 1970–71, Brodie discovered and reported two variants that differed from C.laeve sufficiently to justify naming them as new species.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{stability}} continually plagued the team. The franchise never {{won more than}} 22 games and {{did not return to}} the playoffs after 1977–78 in its six seasons in Colorado. Prior to the 1978–79 season, the team was sold to New Jersey trucking tycoon Arthur Imperatore, who intended to move the team to his home state. The plan was criticized due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> three other NHL teams in the region, and the proposed New Jersey arena was still under construction; the franchise ultimately stayed in Denver. In 1979, the team hired Don Cherry as head coach and featured forward Lanny McDonald. The Rockies still posted the worst record in the NHL, and Cherry was subsequently fired after the season. After two more years in Denver, the Rockies were sold to a group headed by John McMullen (who also owned Major League Baseball's Houston Astros) on May 27, 1982, and the franchise moved to New Jersey. As part of the relocation deal, the Devils had to compensate the three existing teams in the region – the New York Islanders, New York Rangers and Flyers – for encroaching on their territory.|$|E
5|$|A third subplot centres on the {{relationship}} between Fenwick, Mr. Puddleham, the village's Methodist minister, and the Marquis of Trowbridge, Bullhampton's principal landowner. The marquis believes that Sam Brattle is guilty of the murder, and is angered by Fenwick's support for him. He spreads rumours about Fenwick's relations with Carry Brattle, and grants Puddleham permission to build a chapel on a piece of land neighbouring Fenwick's residence, where he hopes that the sight of it and the sound of its bell will annoy the vicar. Fenwick tries to reconcile himself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> the chapel, but it subsequently comes to light that the land does not belong to the marquis, and is instead part of the parish's glebe. The embarrassed marquis pays to move the chapel to a new location, and through the intervention of his son, a suave Member of Parliament, he and Fenwick are reconciled.|$|E

5|$|Although the Haflinger is {{now found}} {{all over the}} world, the {{majority}} of breeding stock still comes from Austria, where state studs own the stallions and carefully maintain {{the quality of the}} breed. However, there are breeding farms located in the United States, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and England. As of 2007, Italian Haflingers had the largest population of any breed in that country. Due to selective breeding during the 1990s aiming to increase height, some breed lines became favored over others in Italy. A 2007 study found little inbreeding within the Italian Haflinger population as a whole, although certain less popular lines had a higher incidence due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> fewer breeding stallions. Haflingers are bred throughout France, especially in the provinces of Brittany, Burgundy and Picardy, with between 350 and 400 foals born each year. Slovenia also has a small Haflinger population, with around 307 breeding mares and 30 breeding stallions as of 2008. A 2009 study found that although there was a very small amount of inbreeding in the population, it was increasing slightly over the years. As of 2005 there were almost 250,000Haflingers in the world.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} source of studying ancient Tamil history are the coins {{that have been found}} in recent years in the excavations, megaliths, hoards and surface. The coins belonging to the Sangam age, found in Tamil Nadu are generally classified into three categories. The first category consists of punch-marked coins from Magadha (400 BCE–187 BCE) and the Satavahanas (200 BCE–200 CE). The second category is made up of coins from the Roman Empire dated from 31 BCE to 217 CE, coins of Phoenicians and Seleucids and coins from the Mediterranean region (c. 300 BCE). The third category of Sangam age Tamil coins are the punch-marked silver, copper and lead coins dated 200 BCE–200 CE and assigned to the Sangam age Tamil kings. The coins belonging to the first two categories mostly attest to the trading relationships that the Tamil people had with the kingdoms of northern India and the outside world. But they do not offer much information regarding the Sangam age Tamil polity. The third category of coins, however, have provided direct testimony <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> ancient Tamil kingdoms and have been used to establish their period to coincide with that of the Sangam literature.|$|E
5|$|Ear {{piercing}} {{and nose}} piercing {{have been particularly}} widespread and are well represented in historical records and among grave goods.

Nose piercing is documented {{as far back as}} 1500 BC.

Nipple and genital piercing have also been practiced by various cultures, with nipple piercing dating back at least to Ancient Rome while genital piercing is described in Ancient India c. 320 to 550 CE. The history of navel piercing is less clear. The practice of body piercing has waxed and waned in Western culture, but it has experienced an increase of popularity since World War II, with sites other than the ears gaining subcultural popularity in the 1970s and spreading to mainstream in the 1990s.|$|E
