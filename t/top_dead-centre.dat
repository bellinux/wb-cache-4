25|$|Formula One cars use {{short stroke}} engines. These engines {{are common in}} racing {{motorcycles}} and streetbikes. The bore is {{the diameter of the}} cylinder in the engine block, and the stroke is the distance the piston travels from <b>top</b> <b>dead-centre</b> (TDC) to bottom dead-centre (BDC) inside the cylinder. To operate at high engine speeds the stroke must be relatively short to prevent catastrophic failure; this is usually connecting rod failure as the rod is under very large stresses at these speeds. Having a short stroke means that a relatively large bore is required to make the 1.6 litre engine displacement. This results in a less efficient combustion stroke, especially at lower rpm. The stroke of a Formula One engine is approximately , less than half the bore diameter , what is known as an over-square configuration.|$|E
