5|$|Although it was {{cut short}} by Roosevelt's desire to have him testify before Congress on Lend-Lease, Willkie's visit to Britain was deemed a triumph. Willkie also went to Ireland, hoping to persuade Éamon de Valera to abandon neutrality, but his urging was unavailing. Willkie left London for Washington on February 5; {{because of the risk}} of being shot down by Nazi aircraft, the {{roundabout}} journey home took four days. He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 11, and his support was key <b>to</b> <b>passing</b> Lend-Lease.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the town}} line, NY11A intersects Otisco Road (CR246) and passes several farms {{on its way}} to the hamlet of Cardiff. Here, the route runs past a line of homes prior <b>to</b> <b>passing</b> under US20 at the {{northern}} edge of the community. Outside of Cardiff, the highway becomes known as Syracuse–Tully Valley Road as it slowly curves to the northwest, matching a similar turn in the course of the creek and its valley. As the road traverses another stretch of cultivated fields, it meets Field Lane, a short connector providing access between NY11A and US20. Past this point, NY11A serves little more than farms before it enters the Onondaga Reservation. At this point, maintenance of the route shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the Onondaga Nation.|$|E

5|$|Encompassing , the Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building stood {{three stories}} tall. The second and first floors (the latter of which lies {{partially}} below ground) contained laboratory space while {{the third floor}} consisted of communal and teaching spaces like classrooms and offices. Other offices {{on the first floor}} were lit via skylights. The stairwells in Mudd were designed with the purpose of discouraging students from passing through lab spaces to get {{from one side of the}} building to the other. In spite of this, Michael J. Crosbie reported in Architecture in 1986 that students had taken <b>to</b> <b>passing</b> through the building as a shortcut instead of going around it.

5|$|Modi's {{first year}} as prime {{minister}} saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations.

Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policies frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted <b>to</b> <b>passing</b> a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.|$|E

5|$|The first Battersea Bridge was a toll bridge {{commissioned}} by John, Earl Spencer, {{who had recently}} acquired the rights to operate the ferry. Although a stone bridge was planned, difficulties in raising investment meant that a cheaper wooden bridge was built instead. Designed by Henry Holland, it was initially opened to pedestrians in November 1771, and to vehicle traffic in 1772. The bridge was inadequately designed and dangerous both to its users and <b>to</b> <b>passing</b> shipping, and boats often collided with it. To reduce the dangers to shipping, two piers were removed and the sections of the bridge above them were strengthened with iron girders.|$|E
5|$|To {{defeat the}} Voting Rights Act, McCulloch {{introduced}} an alternative bill, H.R. 7896. It {{would have allowed}} the Attorney General to appoint federal registrars after receiving 25 serious complaints of discrimination about a jurisdiction, {{and it would have}} imposed a nationwide ban on literacy tests for persons who could prove they attained a sixth-grade education. McCulloch's bill was co-sponsored by House Minority Leader Gerald Ford (R-MI) and supported by Southern Democrats {{as an alternative to the}} Voting Rights Act. The Johnson administration viewed H.R. 7896 as a serious threat <b>to</b> <b>passing</b> the Voting Rights Act. However, support for H.R. 7896 dissipated after William M. Tuck (D-VA) publicly said he preferred H.R. 7896 because the Voting Rights Act would legitimately ensure that African Americans could vote. His statement alienated most supporters of H.R. 7896, and the bill failed on the House floor by a 171-248 vote on July 9. Later that night, the House passed the Voting Rights Act by a 333-85 vote (Democrats 221-61, Republicans 112-24).|$|E
5|$|Following Shooting Accuracy, {{both teams}} {{participated in the}} Skills Challenge Relay. Each team broke into two groups and went {{through a series of}} drills {{designed}} to showcase players' skills. It started with one timers, then proceeded <b>to</b> <b>passing,</b> where a single player had to complete a pass into six small nets. From there it went to the Puck Control Relay, having a participant skate through a series of cones with a puck. Another player then took on the Stick Handling drill, controlling a puck through a series of stationary pucks. The relay ended when a final player completed the Shooting Accuracy, again hitting all four targets. The two groups from Team Lidstrom finished first and third in the competition, gaining their team a total of five points. During the Hardest Shot competition reigning champion Zdeno Chara was defeated in his preliminary round match up by Shea Weber. In the final round, Chara again matched up with Weber. Chara successfully defended his title by defeating Weber with a shot registering 105.9mph. The speed set a new SuperSkills record surpassing his own record and marking the fourth time he has won the event. Despite being down by a large margin prior to the Elimination Shootout, Team Lidstrom still had an opportunity to win the contest. Players continued to shoot provided they scored – scoring one point per goal, until only one player remained. However, the shoot-out was won by Team Staal's Corey Perry as he was the only player to score in all three of his attempts. The full results are listed below.|$|E

5|$|From September 9 to September 11, Ophelia fluctuated in strength, being {{downgraded}} to {{a tropical}} storm only to regain hurricane intensity three more times; during this time it moved very slowly and erratically in a northeasterly direction. The NHC continued to struggle to predict Ophelia, with the forecasts generally calling for a landfall {{on the east coast}} of the United States. The forecasters indicated there was a possibility that Ophelia could strengthen further to Category 3 strength, though they felt this was unlikely. On September 12, the storm completed a clockwise loop, then adopted a more north-westerly motion towards North Carolina, while still moving only slowly and fitfully. It dropped below hurricane strength again when the inner core of convection collapsed, possibly due <b>to</b> <b>passing</b> over cooler water that it upwelled earlier in its track. Ophelia then regained hurricane strength over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. After the collapse of the inner core of convection, the hurricane acquired an unusually large eye over 115miles (185km) across and soon reached its peak strength with 85mph (140km/h) winds. The northern and western eyewall passed over the coastal areas of North Carolina throughout September 14–15, but the strongest winds remained offshore.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Felicia was {{the third}} strongest {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season, {{as well as the}} strongest storm to exist in the eastern Pacific at the time since Hurricane Daniel in 2006. Forming as a tropical depression on August3, the storm supported strong thunderstorm activity and quickly organized. It became a tropical storm over the following day, and subsequently underwent rapid deepening to attain hurricane status. Later that afternoon, Felicia featured a well-defined eye as its winds sharply rose to major hurricane-force on the SaffirSimpson scale. Further strengthening ensued, and Felicia peaked in intensity as a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 145mph (230km/h) and a barometric pressure of 935mbar (hPa; 27.61inHg). After reaching this strength, unfavorable conditions, such as wind shear, began to impact the storm while it took on a northwestward path. Henceforth, Felicia slowly weakened for several days; by August8 it had been downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane, once again becoming a tropical storm the next day. It retraced westward towards Hawaii on August10, all the while decreasing in organization. On August11, Felicia weakened to tropical depression status, and soon degenerated into remnant low just prior <b>to</b> <b>passing</b> over the islands.|$|E
