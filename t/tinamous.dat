5|$|The <b>tinamous</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} ancient groups of bird. Although they look similar to other ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no close {{relatives}} and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the ratites (order Struthioniformes), that includes the rheas, emus, and kiwis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tinamous</b> prefer thick {{branches}} {{on which}} to roost as they do not clutch the branch with their toes, but rest on it with folded legs. They will reuse the same locations and avoid defecating nearby to avoid advertising the roost site to predators. The smaller forest species, along with the steppe <b>tinamous,</b> will roost on the ground, sometimes in the shelter of a bush. They will also use the same location repeatedly; known examples are the elegant crested and ornate <b>tinamous.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Tinamous</b> {{are largely}} {{sedentary}} birds. Forest-dwelling <b>tinamous</b> will move short distances if climatic conditions, such as intense rain, flooding or drought force them to. Most Amazonian species will move between the varzea forests and dry land depending on water levels. The puna tinamou occupies high ridges in the Andes but, in bad weather, will move {{down to the}} valley floors.|$|E
25|$|Identification of <b>tinamous</b> {{is not an}} easy task; {{utilizing}} {{their calls}} as a tool is integral. Each species has its own unique call or calls. The solitary tinamou has 11 different vocalizations. In most species both sexes call; some have different calls for males and females. Females tend to have deeper voices. Some species, in particular members of Crypturellus, have regional dialects. Male slaty-breasted <b>tinamous</b> have calls unique enough to be individually recognized by humans.|$|E
25|$|Water is {{required}} by most tinamou species, with some needing a good source within their home territory. Solitary <b>tinamous</b> can withstand an extended period without water by eating more succulent plants. However, species that live in arid or semi-arid climates rarely need any water additional to that ingested with their diet. When <b>tinamous</b> drink, unlike most other birds, they do so by sucking and swallowing, instead of lifting their heads and letting gravity do the work.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tinamous</b> are {{exclusively}} neotropical and all 47 species live in South America, Mexico, and Central America. The {{range of}} the northernmost species extends to Mexico but not much further north than the Tropic of Cancer. Chilean <b>tinamous</b> have been introduced to Easter Island. The greatest concentration of species is in the tropics, {{and in particular the}} Amazon Basin. In the north, they tend to be forest or woodland birds, while in the south they prefer open habitats. <b>Tinamous</b> form the dominant group of terrestrial birds in South America, where they largely replace the Galliformes ecologically, with no other bird family there having comparable diversity, distribution, or suite of habitat adaptations. Rheas are only found in open country, curassows and guans are generally limited to forests, and the pheasant family is only represented by a few species in the north of the region.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tinamous,</b> {{depending}} on the species, may be solitary or social and gather in groups. Gregariousness also varies by season. Forest species tend to be solitary and may only approach other birds during the breeding season. Some live as mated pairs throughout the year. Steppe or grassland species tend to live in groups, though with little obvious group interaction apart from an occasional contact call. Group size may vary by season; in winter, aggregations of elegant crested <b>tinamous</b> may approach 100 birds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tinamous</b> are avid bathers. During {{heavy rain}} they may stand erect with their bill {{pointing}} skyward allowing the rain to wash over them. They will dust-bathe at regular intervals, {{and have been}} known to dust-bathe often enough to tint themselves the same color as the soil. They also sunbathe, and will do so while resting on one leg with an outstretched wing. Defecation for a tinamou is a slightly involved task as it must move aside the dense plumage that surrounds the cloaca to avoid soiling itself. Captive <b>tinamous</b> defecate once daily.|$|E
25|$|They {{occur in}} a wide range of habitats. Members of the genera Tinamus, Nothocercus, and Crypturellus live in dense forests, with Nothocercus preferring high {{altitude}}, and members of most other genera in grassland, puna, montane forest, and savanna. Tinamotis and Nothoprocta prefer high altitude habitats, up to , whereas the other steppe <b>tinamous</b> have a wide altitude range. <b>Tinamous</b> inhabit most parts of South and Central America, as well as the tropical regions of Mexico, with the exception of aquatic, snow-covered, and true desert habitats, and the southernmost tip of Patagonia.|$|E
25|$|Of Gondwanan origin, <b>tinamous</b> {{are members}} of the ratites, which {{comprise}} the Palaeognathae ("old jaws"), while all other living birds {{are members of}} Neognathae ("new jaws"). Unlike other palaeognaths, <b>tinamous</b> do have a keeled sternum, but like the other palaeognaths, they have a distinctive palate. It was formerly believed that the Tinamiformes separated from the ratites early on due to their retention of a keeled sternum. The tinamous' possession of powder-down feathers and preen glands, which the ratites lack, was a source of confusion in determining their taxonomy.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species have}} adapted to {{agricultural}} systems and will enter grain fields after the harvest to glean the ground; they will also enter the fields during the growing season, {{to the dismay of}} the farmers. Some, in particular the ornate and Andean <b>tinamous,</b> will dig up tubers such as potatoes, while red-winged <b>tinamous</b> create similar problems in peanut plantations. However, some members of Nothoprocta will prey on insect pests without damaging the crops. Spotted nothuras have been documented eating weeds and, of the 28 animals they were recorded as eating, 26 were considered to be pests.|$|E
25|$|There {{are over}} 240species of bird lice that infest <b>tinamous,</b> with one {{individual}} bird recorded as hosting nine species. Blood parasites include louse flies, leeches, nematodes, cestodes, armadillo ticks, mites, and trematodes. Darwin's nothura may carry a malarial plasmodium.|$|E
25|$|The Tinamiformes {{are one of}} {{the least}} studied orders of birds despite <b>tinamous</b> exhibiting rare and little {{understood}} behavioral patterns. They have male parental care which is not always associated with polyandry or sex-role reversal. Their varied mating systems and diverse habitats have the potential, through comparative studies, to explain how ecological differences affect mating strategies. In some species, females cooperate in assembling clutches of eggs for different males. However, methodological difficulties have hampered behavioral research, especially on the forest dwelling species, because their secretive behavior and cryptic coloration make them difficult to follow for continuous observation. It was not until 2003 that the first scientific symposium on <b>tinamous</b> was organized at the VIIth Neotropical Ornithological Congress, held at Termas de Puyehue, Chile.|$|E
25|$|The common ostrich {{shares the}} order Struthioniformes with the kiwis, emus, rheas, and cassowaries. However, phylogenetic {{studies have shown}} that it is the sister group to all other members of Palaeognathae and thus the {{flighted}} <b>tinamous</b> are the sister group to the extinct moa.|$|E
25|$|Geographical {{strengths}} include North America, especially Florida, and the Neotropics, {{with smaller}} but notable numbers of recordings from Africa, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Some taxonomic groups especially well represented are <b>tinamous,</b> trogons, woodpeckers, antbirds, New World flycatchers, wrens, New World wood warblers, and corvids.|$|E
25|$|Research {{published}} {{starting in}} 2010 {{has found that}} the moa's closest cousins are small terrestrial South American birds called the <b>tinamous</b> which are able to fly. Previously, the kiwi, the Australian emu, and cassowary were thought to be most closely related to the moa.|$|E
25|$|Most species eat {{a mixture}} {{of plant and animal}} products, though some are mainly herbivorous and others {{predominantly}} insectivorous or carnivorous. Diet may also vary seasonally; red-winged <b>tinamous</b> eat mostly animal food in the summer and plant matter in the winter. Chicks eat more insects than their parents, probably for their growth needs.|$|E
25|$|In most tinamou species, {{the males}} {{practice}} simultaneous polygyny and the females sequential polyandry. This is not invariable; ornate <b>tinamous</b> form stable pairs, and spotted nothuras are monogamous when young and polygamous when older. There are {{larger numbers of}} females than males; for example, the variegated tinamou has a female to male ratio of 4:1.|$|E
25|$|Many South American zoos hold <b>tinamous,</b> as do {{some private}} estates. Examples of captive {{breeding}} are small-billed tinamou in Minas Gerais and red-winged tinamou in Rio Grande do Sul. The small-billed tinamou has looked promising for domestication as the birds can raise 3â€“4 broods {{per year and}} are resistant to diseases that affect domestic chickens.|$|E
25|$|The plumage of {{the family}} is cryptic, as is usual with ground birds, with typical colors ranging through dark brown, rufous, buff, yellow and grey. Plumage does not usually differ between sexes, but in a few species females are brighter. The forest dwellers tend to be darker and more uniform, whereas the steppe species are paler with more barring, speckling, or streaking. <b>Tinamous</b> have {{well-developed}} powder down feathers; these grow continuously and disintegrate at the tips into a powder that is spread {{through the rest of}} the feathers by preening. This gives the plumage a glossy appearance as well as waterproofing it. Their tails are short, sometimes hidden behind the coverts, and possibly indicative of an ability to sacrifice feathers to a predator in order to escape when grasped. Some <b>tinamous</b> have crests. Members of Eudromia have the most developed crests and, when excited, will direct them forward.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th century {{there were}} {{numerous}} attempts to introduce or reintroduce <b>tinamous</b> to {{various parts of the}} world. The red-winged tinamou has been reintroduced to the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where its wild population was hunted to extermination {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. France, Germany, and Hungary have all, unsuccessfully, attempted to introduce them into their countryside.|$|E
25|$|The solitary tinamou, {{limited to}} the Atlantic forests of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina, is {{threatened}} by habitat destruction and hunting. In the cloud forests of northern South America, there are fewer than 10,000 black <b>tinamous</b> left. The tepui tinamou's range is {{limited to the}} tops of a handful of plateaus in the cloud forests of Venezuela, making it highly vulnerable to any threat.|$|E
25|$|Flight-capable lithornithids {{from the}} Paleocene and Eocene epochs {{appear to have}} been {{structurally}} the most similar precursors to the <b>tinamous,</b> and may have been ancestral to them {{as well as to the}} ratites, though their precise relationships are unclear. The earliest unequivocally Tinamiforme fossil material dates from the Miocene, but flightless ratite-like taxa from the Paleocene may belong to this group.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tinamous</b> {{are rarely}} seen but often heard within their range {{and have a}} wide variety of calls. They are among the most {{characteristic}} bird vocalizations of South America and Central America, often resembling sounds made by a flute or a whistle. Some calls are uniform and monotone, while others have multiple phrases. They vary in intensity and can often be heard from afar. Trying to locate a bird by its call is not easy.|$|E
25|$|The {{breeding}} season varies from species to species; those {{that live in}} tropical forests, where there is little seasonal change, may breed at any time, though there is usually a preferred period. In areas with a marked seasonal fluctuation, <b>tinamous</b> generally breed when food is most abundant, which is usually summer. Studies have shown {{that it is not}} day length that determines the onset of breeding, but the amount of light, through cloud cover.|$|E
25|$|Nothurine fossils referrable to Eudromia and Nothura {{have been}} found in the Late Miocene Cerro Azul Formation from the Pampean region of central-southern Argentina. <b>Tinamous</b> {{described}} from Pliocene material include Eudromia olsoni Tambussi & Tonni, 1985, Nothura parvulus Rovereto, 1914, and Nothura padulosa Mercerat, 1897. The Pliocene fossil genera Cayetornis Brodkorb and Tinamisornis Rovereto have been synonymized with Nothura and Eudromia respectively. Fossils having affinities with several extant genera {{have been found}} in Pleistocene deposits.|$|E
25|$|Plains-dwelling <b>tinamous</b> have higher-pitched, more {{delicate}} voices. They {{can also be}} less melodic, sometimes resembling the chirps of crickets. Forest species tend to have deep, loud calls, suitable for penetrating the vegetation. The male highland tinamou can be heard several kilometres distant through dense forest. When calling, a tinamou extends its neck vertically, tilts its head at an angle, and opens its bill wide. A bird, when flushed, will utter a sharp trill.|$|E
25|$|There {{may be as}} many as 16 eggs in a clutch, a {{consequence}} of several females laying in the same nest. The more mature male will attract more females and may have the eggs of up to four females under him. The variegated and ornate <b>tinamous</b> have single-female nests, and consequently only one or two eggs per nest. This may result from food shortage in their ranges and the consequent ability to care for only one or two chicks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tinamous</b> {{and their}} eggs have many natural predators, from falcons and vampire bats to jaguars. They {{have also been}} {{extensively}} hunted by humans and sometimes persecuted as agricultural pests. However, the main threat to their populations is from habitat destruction through land clearing and agricultural development. Seven species are listed as vulnerable and another seven as near-threatened. They feature in the mythology of the indigenous peoples of their range. Often translocated and easily bred in captivity, {{they have never been}} successfully domesticated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tinamous</b> are {{opportunistic}} feeders {{and eat a}} {{wide range}} of foods, though each species varies in proportional dietary makeup. Tinamou genera can be roughly divided into three groups based on the vegetable component of their diets. Tinamus, Nothocercus and Crypturellus focus on fleshy fruit. Nothura, Nothoprocta and Eudromia, comprising open country birds, eat mainly seeds and other soft vegetative matter. High-altitude genera living in harsh environments, such as Tinamotis, will eat most of the plant, not just the succulent parts.|$|E
25|$|Behavioral and {{ecological}} separation of tinamou species is evident where their ranges overlap through {{the utilization of}} different food sources and occupation of limited micro-habitats. These micro-habitats are {{not always easy to}} identify, and are highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Some species, such as the red-winged tinamou, utilize multiple habitats such as the open savannas of Amazonia and the dry valleys of the Andes. Similarly, brown <b>tinamous</b> occur in both the Amazon basin and the humid montane forests on the Andean slope.|$|E
25|$|If {{the male}} becomes alarmed {{enough to leave}} the nest, he will attempt a {{distraction}} display. This usually involves a fake injury display, {{similar to that of}} the killdeer. To do this, he will hop on one leg and attempt to fly, always falling down. He will perform this display if the eggs have not hatched or the chicks are still too young to fly. It is generally believed that <b>tinamous</b> are not as effective at distraction displays as other birds.|$|E
25|$|Both steppe {{and forest}} species are territorial, though {{territoriality}} varies between species from being characteristic {{only during the}} breeding season, to being territorial throughout the year. When defending their territories from conspecifics, <b>tinamous</b> are highly vocal, creating a cacophony of sound. When an intruder is noticed, birds {{of the same sex}} will confront it. This may lead to conflict, with feet and wings being used in attack. Both males and females will defend their territories; however, in each species only one sex is fiercely territorial.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tinamous</b> {{have been}} popular game birds {{for many years}} in South America and Central America, so much so that some species' numbers have dropped. The steppe birds are more popular to hunt because they can be flushed into flight, rather than the forest birds that run to cover and hide. In the late 19th and early 20th century hunting was {{responsible}} for mass killing within the family, with the elegant crested tinamou and spotted nothura popular targets. In 1921, Argentina urged the control of commercial hunting of several bird species, including tinamou.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tinamous</b> have {{established}} {{themselves in the}} folklore and histories of the indigenous people of South America and Central America. Forest tribes of Brazil and Colombia believe the jaguar imitates {{the call of the}} great tinamou in order to track and eat it. A tale from the Guahibo Indians tells of a young man traveling by canoe who tried to locate a calling tinamou. As he approached the bank he became suspicious at the harshness of the call and backed away just as a jaguar burst out of the vegetation.|$|E
25|$|The {{dwarf tinamou}} is a {{resident}} of the open plains of eastern Brazil, though there are fewer than 15,000 birds left. It has disappeared from its former range on the grasslands of Argentina. In the cerrado grasslands of Brazil the population of the lesser nothura has also decreased to fewer than 15,000 individuals because of agricultural and economic development. The practice of burning the fields is particularly detrimental to grassland <b>tinamous.</b> For example, the dwarf tinamou becomes intoxicated with the smoke and vulnerable to predators. Moreover, if the burning occurs during the nesting season, the eggs or chicks are roasted.|$|E
