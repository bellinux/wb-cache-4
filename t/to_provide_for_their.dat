5|$|As weather {{conditions}} shift due to climate change, bees change their behaviors. When it rains, bees {{do not go}} out and during extremely hot weather they try to gather water to keep the colony cool. Climatologists have predicted that the occurrence of extreme weather events (such as intense rainy seasons and prolonged drought) will increase as the climate continues to change. Additionally, in regions that experience increasingly more rain, pollen will be washed away more easily {{making it more difficult}} for bees <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> colonies. Meanwhile, in environments experiencing prolonged drought, flower environments may dwindle with dry weather. These patterns lead to less suitable and viable environments in which bees can thrive. A British journal published projections of plant diversity loss against spatial sensitivity; the researchers found major species loss {{in the southern part of}} the UK forcing bee colonies further north.|$|E
5|$|Metcalfe {{received}} only a rudimentary education, and at age sixteen, he was apprenticed {{to his brother}} and learned the craft of stonemasonry. Three years later, their father died, leaving the brothers <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> mother and younger siblings. Metcalfe {{became one of the}} most prominent stonemasons and building contractors during the settlement period of Kentucky. A number of his stone houses survive and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including his first home in Robertson County. Other structures built by the Metcalfe brothers are the state's first governor's mansion and the Green County courthouse, known as the oldest courthouse in Kentucky, and the Presbyterian church at West Union in far southern Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{concerned}} property bequeathed in {{the will}} of Alfred's father, Æthelwulf. This does not survive, but Alfred described some of its provisions in a preamble to his own will. Æthelwulf had left property jointly to three of his four surviving sons, Æthelbald, Æthelred and Alfred, stipulating that {{all of it was}} to be inherited by the brother who lived the longest. When Æthelred inherited the throne in 865, Alfred asked for the property to be divided between them. Æthelred refused, offering instead to leave it to Alfred on his death, together with any further property he acquired, and Alfred agreed. The Viking invasion of Wessex, and the need <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> children, led to a revision of the terms. Under an agreement in late 870 or early 871, the survivor was still to keep the property bequeathed jointly to the three brothers, but he would give his brother's children any lands which he had received separately from his father, and any he had acquired later.|$|E

5|$|The term iftar has a {{different}} meaning in Ramadan where {{it is used to}} describe the 'breaking of fasting' unlike its common meaning of breakfast in the morning. Iftar begins with soup, either made from lentils, vegetables or freekeh. Shurbat freekeh ("freekeh soup") is made from cracked, green wheat cooked in chicken broth. There is a wide variety of meals served during iftar, ranging from small plates or bowls vegetable-based courses or saniyyehs (large plates or trays) of a particular meat. Common small dishes on the dinner table are bamia—a name for okra in tomato paste, mloukhiyeh—a corchorus stew—or maqali, an array of fried tomatoes, aubergines, potatoes, peppers and zucchini. Pilaf or plain freekeh are normally served alongside the dinner meat. Each household prepares extra food <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> neighbors and the less fortunate—who must receive an equal version of the food eaten at home.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the late Republic, {{formerly}} authoritative institutions lost their credibility and authority. For example, the Sullan reforms to the Senate strongly split the aristocratic class between those who stayed in the city and those who rose to high office abroad, further increasing class divides between Romans, even at the highest levels. Furthermore, the dominance of the military in the late Republic, along with stronger ties between a general and his troops, caused by their longer terms of service together and the troops' reliance on that general <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> retirements, along with an obstructionist central government, meant a huge number of malcontent soldiers willing to take up arms against the state. Adding in the institutionalisation of violence as a means to obstruct or force political change (e.g. the deaths of the Gracchi and Sulla's dictatorship, respectively), the Republic was caught in an ever more violent and anarchic struggle between the Senate, assemblies at Rome, and the promagistrates. It would only be resolved by civil war, a war which the promagistrate governors and their troops would win, and in doing so, collapse the Republic.|$|E

50|$|Cultural {{knowledge}} is recruited when individuals need <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> reasons <b>for</b> <b>their</b> decision. The need <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> reasons evokes an information-processing strategy {{that relies on}} top-down application of rules and principles instead of bottom-up processing that relies on personal knowledge. This can be explained {{with the help of}} the supposition that individuals feel the pressure to conform when asked <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> reasons, as they don't want to be the outsiders. When they are not asked to explain their choices, they feel freer to rely on their personal knowledge. It has been found that Chinese have a significantly lower tendency to compromise, which earlier on has been found to be one of their characteristic traits, when not asked <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> reasons <b>for</b> <b>their</b> consumer decisions.

25|$|Early {{settlers}} to {{the region}} were hunter-gatherer tribes {{similar to those in}} North Alabama. A variety of Native American populations visited the area that would become Daphne including Tensaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole. This area {{came to be known as}} neutral ground where tribes would meet and discuss the relationships between their nations. Small groups worked together to acquire food and <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> families. Initially, these groups enjoyed an economy based upon hunting and scavenging but as time passed production of weapons and pottery became more advanced. During the late Woodland stage Native Americans began to practice more elaborate ritual services. Although no burial grounds are known in Daphne, they are scattered throughout nearby Baldwin County.|$|E
25|$|Because {{much of the}} Honduran {{economy is}} based on small scale {{agriculture}} {{of only a few}} exports, natural disasters have a particularly devastating impact. Natural disasters such as 1998 Hurricane Mitch have contributed to this inequality as they particularly affecting poor rural areas. (1) They are a large contributor to food insecurity in the country as farmers are left unable <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> families. Southern and Western regions are most vulnerable to this as they both subject environmental destruction and home to many sustenance farmers. The agricultural economic sector has declined a third in the past twenty years. This is due to a decline in exports such as banana and coffee that were affected by factors such as natural disasters.|$|E

However, courts uniformly recognize that the custodial parent will incur expenses for the care of children that a non-custodial parent might prefer not to pay, and that giving the non-custodial parent direct control over how child support is used would in many cases result in abusive or controlling behavior by the child support payor.|$|R
