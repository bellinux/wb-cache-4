25|$|Knee Savers: Special pads {{filled with}} air that attach to <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> of the shin guards, {{allowing}} cushion for the catcher {{when they are}} in the squatting position; they provide support for the knee ligaments which can, over time, stretch and tear.|$|E
50|$|A strap lock is {{a device}} that {{prevents}} <b>the</b> guitar <b>strap</b> from slipping off <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> peg. Several companies make these, and players also improvise various devices that fit over the part of <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> peg that protrudes through <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> end—rubber washers, plastic bag closures, etc.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>STRAP</b> V {{system was}} {{developed}} to provide higher accuracy and lower limit cycle fine pointing (+ or - 7 arcseconds) in all three axes at targets which cannot be tracked by startrackers or solar trackers. The system provides an increase in pointing performance over that obtainable with <b>the</b> <b>STRAP</b> IV (1) Attitude Control System (ACS). <b>The</b> <b>STRAP</b> IV concept of third axis updates is utilized to reduce pointing errors, using <b>the</b> flight-proven <b>STRAP</b> III (2) system as a first stage. Flight aspect photographs and telemetry records show that <b>the</b> <b>STRAP</b> V objectives have been met. <b>The</b> <b>STRAP</b> IV major error contributors have been significantly reduced and the tracking flexibility has been increased with only minor error contributions. Attention is given to <b>the</b> basic <b>STRAP</b> III control modes, major STRAP IV system error sources, tuned restrained inertial gyros (TRIGs), the programmable sequence timer, <b>the</b> <b>STRAP</b> V control box, third axis update, system gyro alignments, and STRAP V operational capabilities...|$|R
40|$|Strapped or "basket-handle" porphyrins {{have been}} {{investigated}} previously as hemoglobin mimics and catalysts. The facial selectivity of their interactions with axial ligands is a sensitive test for noncovalent bonding. Here the binding of pyridyl ligands to zinc porphyrins with thioester-linked alkyl straps is investigated in solution by NMR spectroscopy and UV-vis titration, and in the solid state by X-ray crystallography. We expected that coordination of the axial ligand would occur on the less hindered face of the porphyrin, away from <b>the</b> <b>strap.</b> Surprisingly, attractive interactions between <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> and <b>the</b> ligand direct axial coordination to <b>the</b> <b>strapped</b> face of <b>the</b> porphyrin, except when <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> is short and tight. <b>The</b> <b>strapped</b> porphyrins were incorporated into π-conjugated cyclic porphyrin hexamers using template-directed synthesis. <b>The</b> <b>strap</b> and <b>the</b> sulfur substituents are located either inside or outside the porphyrin nanoring, depending {{on the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>strap.</b> Six-porphyrin nanorings with outwardly pointing sulfur anchors were prepared for exploring quantum interference effects in single-molecule charge transport...|$|R

25|$|There {{are cases}} of young {{children}} playing (on or near bunk beds, trees, clothes lines, play equipment etc.) suffering death or severe brain damage {{as a result of}} hanging by <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> of their bicycle helmets. European Standard EN 1080, which uses a weak retention system designed to open under load, was published in 1997 to address this problem.|$|E
25|$|Experts {{suggest that}} women choose a bra band that fits {{well on the}} {{outermost}} hooks. This allows the wearer to use the tighter hooks on the bra strap as it stretches during its lifetime of about eight months. The band should be tight enough to support the bust, but <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> should not provide the primary support.|$|E
50|$|Furniture {{is often}} {{strapped}} using a method called double wrap where <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> is {{wrapped around the}} frame, the fastening rivet, and itself on each end.This makes {{it very difficult for}} <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> to pull away from the frame and normally requires <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> to be cut in order to remove it.|$|R

25|$|Stays {{evolved in}} the 18th century when {{whalebone}} was used more, {{and there was more}} boning used in the garment. The shape of the stays changed as well. While the stays were low and wide in the front, they could reach as high as the upper shoulder in the back. Stays could be strapless or use shoulder straps. <b>The</b> <b>straps</b> of the stays were generally attached in the back and tied at the front sides.|$|E
25|$|The ball is {{strapped}} {{into the mouth}} behind the teeth, with <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> going around the head to secure it in place. They are used {{as a sign of}} control by the dominant. If the ball is very large, {{it may be difficult to}} insert behind the teeth or to remove it. The wearer can still be heard, but it renders their speech completely unintelligible, distorts their facial features, and causes drooling if the wearer attempts to talk.|$|E
25|$|The second {{match was}} a Carson City Silver Dollar match between John Tenta and Big Bubba, who was {{accompanied}} by Jimmy Hart. Attached {{to one of the}} ringposts by straps was a tall steel pole, with a sock of silver coins hanging from the top. At the start of the match, both attempted to get the sock but were stopped by the other. Bubba climbed the turnbuckles but Tenta forced him to drop onto the top turnbuckle. After performing an atomic drop onto the turnbuckle, Tenta tossed Bubba to the outside. Tenta attempted to remove <b>the</b> <b>straps.</b> Bubba came back and uses a belt to choke Tenta. He then used athletic tape to tape Tenta's left wrist to the middle rope and continued attacking Tenta with the belt. As Bubba cut Tenta's hair with scissors, Tenta performed a low blow. Using the scissors, he cut his hand free and attempted to cut <b>the</b> <b>straps.</b> Bubba stopped him, and performed a spinebuster. Bubba then told Hart to climb the pole. As Hart got the sock, Tenta performed a scoop slam. Tenta grabbed the sock from Hart, hit Bubba with it, and pinned Bubba for the victory.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} a design of an inflatable module including a rigid member disposed in a restraint layer, wherein the restraint layer includes orthogonal straps, includes modeling a <b>strap</b> adjacent to <b>the</b> rigid member and a <b>strap</b> connected to <b>the</b> rigid member. <b>The</b> adjacent <b>strap</b> and <b>the</b> member <b>strap</b> extend {{in a first}} direction. The method further includes selecting a first length of <b>the</b> member <b>strap</b> such that <b>the</b> adjacent <b>strap</b> carries load before <b>the</b> member <b>strap</b> during pressurization of the inflatable module, modeling tensions in <b>the</b> member <b>strap</b> with <b>the</b> first length and <b>the</b> adjacent <b>strap</b> during pressurization of the inflatable model, and outputting the modeled tensions in <b>the</b> member <b>strap</b> with <b>the</b> first length and <b>the</b> adjacent <b>strap.</b> An inflatable module includes a member strap having a length such that an adjacent strap carries load before <b>the</b> member <b>strap</b> during pressurization of the inflatable module...|$|R
5000|$|Blackmun {{held that}} use of <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> in {{question}} is punishment that [...] "runs afoul" [...] of the Eighth Amendment.

25|$|Each truss {{consisted}} of sixteen eye-bar panels pinned together. Removing one part {{would break the}} structure's rigidity and make moving it very difficult. Instead of shifting the spans off piers for lowering or pivoting them from their present support, the Foundation Company lowered the structure in position, taking off the masonry and using substitute supports for resting the structure without {{getting in the way}} of the process. The contractor attached a frame to each of the piers and abutments, used straps to bind the trusses to each frame, and lowered them using <b>the</b> <b>straps.</b>|$|E
25|$|Traditional babywearing in Japan {{was done}} with a wrap carry, using an obi (sash). In the 1940s, a carrier known as the onbuhimo became popular. Similar to the Hmong and Mei tai carriers, the onbuhimo has long top straps and a {{rectangular}} body. But {{at the bottom of}} the rectangle, loops or rings allow the top straps to be threaded through and tightened, while <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> are tied at the waist. The body is much smaller than the bodies of most mei tais and other Asian-style carriers, and the onbuhimo is traditionally used on the back. Variations may have stiff headrests or padding in the body.|$|E
25|$|Technological {{advances}} in weaving with foot-treadle floor looms {{and the use}} of scissors with pivoted blades and handles in the 13-15th century led to new designs. The upper part of dresses could now be tailored exactly to the body. Men′s dresses were buttoned on the front and women′s dresses got a décolletage. The lower part of men′s dresses were much shorter in length than those for women. They were wide cut and often pleated with an A-line so that horse riding became more comfortable. Even a knights armor had a short metal skirt below the breastplate. It covered <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> attaching the upper legs iron cuisse to the breastplate.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> is tensioned, <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> {{is often}} sealed to itself. Steel strap is sealed with a seal and notch joint, a seal and crimp, seal-less joint, or via welding. Seals come in various shapes {{depending}} on the application; some can be put on after <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> is tensioned, while others must be installed before tensioning. To create the seal, <b>the</b> seal and <b>strap</b> are notched on both sides; if one set of notches are created then it is called a single notch joint, if two sets of notches are created then it is called a double notch joint. Crimp joints also use a seal, but crimp undulations are used instead of formed notches. These crimps form great frictional forces which keep the joint from seeping. Seal-less joints are created by forming interlocking keys {{into the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>strap.</b>|$|R

60|$|Scraps {{had no such}} notion as that in her baggy head. She {{told them}} to fasten one end of <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> to a stout limb of the tree, {{pointing}} to one which extended quite {{to the edge of}} the gulf. Button-Bright did that, climbing the tree and then crawling out upon the limb until he was nearly over the gulf. There he managed to fasten <b>the</b> <b>strap,</b> which reached to the ground below, and then he slid down it and was caught by the Wizard, who feared he might fall into the chasm. Scraps was delighted. She seized the lower end of <b>the</b> <b>strap,</b> and telling them all to get out of her way, she went back as far as <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> would reach and then made a sudden run toward the gulf. Over the edge she swung, clinging to <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> until it had gone as far as its length permitted, when she let go and sailed gracefully through the air until she alighted upon the mountain just in front of them.|$|R
25|$|The {{incident}} {{resulted in}} the first fatality on a spacecraft in flight since the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003. The survival of pilot Peter Siebold also {{marks the first time}} in history that anyone has survived the destruction of a spacecraft during a flight when others on board have died. Investigators are trying to determine how Siebold managed to get out of the rocket plane and parachute to the ground from an altitude of roughly 50,000 feet, an altitude virtually devoid of oxygen. On November 7, Siebold told investigators that the aircraft broke up around him. He was still strapped into his seat. He released <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> and his parachute later deployed automatically. Siebold was not wearing a pressure suit during the flight.|$|E
25|$|The yellow, tan {{and green}} shirts have {{shoulder}} straps (often {{referred to as}} epaulets) and colored shoulder loops (often called tabs) are worn on <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> to indicate the program level. Webelos Scouts wearing tan uniforms and all Cub Scout leaders wear blue loops, Boy Scouts and leaders wear forest green loops (changed from red in 2008), Varsity Scouts and leaders wear blaze (orange) loops, and Venturers and leaders wear emerald green loops. Adults or youth who hold a district, council, or section position wear silver loops; those with area, regional, or national positions wear gold loops. Blue, red, forest green or blaze loops may not be worn on the green Venturing shirt and emerald green loops may not be worn on the tan shirt. Custom loops are not authorized.|$|E
25|$|Rude {{was hired}} by Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF) in December 1984, where he was managed by Percy Pringle. He {{defeated}} Pez Whatley for the NWA Florida Southern Heavyweight Championship on January 16, 1985 and lost it to Brian Blair on April 10, 1985. He captured the championship again on July 20, 1985, when he defeated Mike Graham in the finals of a Southern title tournament. He held the belt until October 2 of that year when he dropped it to Wahoo McDaniel, who was booking Florida during this time. While teaming with Jesse Barr, he won the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship on April 16, 1985, and feuded with Billy Jack Haynes and Wahoo McDaniel over the belts, losing <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> to McDaniel and Haynes on July 9, 1985.|$|E
50|$|Rings {{are usually}} found on <b>the</b> {{shoulder}} <b>straps,</b> where they {{function as a}} joint. For intimate apparel, the requirement of front strap can be different from back <b>strap.</b> <b>The</b> front <b>strap</b> is more decorative and stretchability {{is less of a}} concern while <b>the</b> back <b>strap</b> is required to have better stability when stretched. Therefore, <b>the</b> two different <b>straps</b> (front and back) and the ring found on intimate apparel are important to join the functions of <b>the</b> bra <b>strap</b> together.|$|R
50|$|Rebenque de Argolla 'Ring Rebenque' {{has a large}} metal ring (in Spanish “argolla”) {{instead of}} <b>the</b> wrist <b>strap.</b> <b>The</b> <b>strap</b> used to be wider than in the common rebenque.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two major}} types of {{equipment}} available for strapping: hand tools and strapping machines. A dispenser is used with both types of equipment to dispense <b>the</b> <b>strap.</b> Some <b>strapping</b> machines have <b>the</b> dispenser built-in, others (typically those on large arch machines) have a separate powered dispenser, which can automatically load or thread new coils. Non-powered separated dispensers have a pulley which releases and activates a brake to stop the inertia of the coil to keep <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> from over-running onto the floor. Typically dispensers used on large arch strapping machines have multiple pulleys {{to act as a}} way to store strap in a way that can be quickly dispensed. Smaller arch machines such as table top machines will feed strap into a pool box/accumulator instead. In both cases this is required otherwise <b>the</b> <b>strapping</b> machine will draw <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> faster than <b>the</b> dispenser can pay off.|$|R
25|$|In 1940, Russell {{was signed}} to a seven-year {{contract}} by film mogul Howard Hughes, {{and made her}} motion-picture debut in The Outlaw (1943), a story about Billy the Kid that {{went to great lengths}} to showcase her voluptuous figure. The movie was completed in 1941, but it was not released until 1943 in a limited release. Problems occurred with the censorship of the production code over the way her ample cleavage was displayed. When the movie was finally passed, it had a general release in 1946. During that time, she was kept busy doing publicity and became known nationally. Contrary to countless incorrect reports in the media since the release of The Outlaw, Russell did not wear the specially designed underwire bra that Howard Hughes had designed and made for her to wear during filming. According to Jane's 1985 autobiography, she said that the bra was so uncomfortable that she secretly discarded it and wore her own bra with the cups padded with tissue and <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> pulled up to elevate her breasts.|$|E
25|$|Divers may {{test whether}} a mask {{is a good}} fit by placing it on their face, without using <b>the</b> <b>straps,</b> and gently inhaling through their nose. If the mask stays on without any help this {{indicates}} that no air is being drawn in and that the skirt is in sufficient contact with the facial skin all the way round the mask. Optimum sealing requires that hair strands do not cross under {{the edge of the}} seal, as they can provide a path for water to leak into the mask. This is more a problem with the forehead hairline than with lower facial hair, as water from the top tends to run into the eyes, while water pooling at the bottom is easily purged by exhaling a small volume of air through the nose. Most bearded divers learn to manage the slight leakage without difficulty, inconvenience, or greasing the moustache. Other factors affecting a comfortable fit are sufficient space for the nose in the nose pocket, no contact between the rigid mask frame and the bridge of the nose, and no excessive pressure on the forehead. There should also be sufficient space between the mask lenses and the face that the eyelashes do not contact the glass noticeably when blinking.|$|E
25|$|If <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> {{dig into}} the {{shoulder}}, leaving red marks or causing shoulder or neck pain, the bra band is not offering enough support. If breast tissue overflows {{the bottom of the}} bra, under the armpit, or over the top edge of the bra cup, the cup size is too small. Loose fabric in the bra cup indicates the cup size is too big. If the underwires poke the breast under the armpit or if the bra's center panel does not lie flat against the sternum, the cup size is too small. If the band rides up the torso at the back, the band size is too big. If it digs into the flesh, causing the flesh to spill over the edges of the band, the band is too small. If the band feels tight, {{this may be due to}} the cups being too small; instead of going up in band size a person should try going up in cup size. Similarly a band might feel too loose if the cup is too big. It is possible to test whether a bra band is too tight or too loose by reversing the bra on her torso so that the cups are at the back and then check for fit and comfort. Generally, if the wearer must continually adjust the bra or experiences general discomfort, the bra is a poor fit and she should get a new fitting.|$|E
50|$|When using Aylmeri jesses, {{there are}} usually two sets of straps: <b>the</b> mews <b>straps,</b> for manning and {{tethering}} the bird, and flying <b>straps.</b> <b>The</b> flying <b>straps</b> are lighter and smaller for hunting; <b>the</b> mews <b>straps</b> are heavy {{and less likely to}} break with stress.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>strap</b> can be {{adjusted}} to suit the diver's head. Too loose may not provide an effective seal and the mask may dislodge easily, and too tight may result in discomfort or pain. Correct positioning of <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> around <b>the</b> {{back of the head}} will reduce the risk of dislodging and facilitate clearing.|$|R
50|$|Flash: The upper cavesson is {{adjusted}} somewhat {{tighter than}} a plain cavesson {{to prevent it}} from being pulled {{toward the end of the}} muzzle by <b>the</b> lower flash <b>strap.</b> <b>The</b> lower flash <b>strap</b> runs below <b>the</b> bit and under the chin groove.
