5000|$|A turn coordinator, or <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator</b> {{which helps}} the pilot {{maintain}} {{the plane in}} a coordinated attitude while turning.|$|R
5000|$|In aircraft, the [...] "ball" [...] in turn coordinators or <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicators</b> is {{sometimes}} referred to as an inclinometer.|$|R
50|$|The {{article also}} lauds the {{artificial}} horizon <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator</b> that Post <b>and</b> Gatty used, which {{was developed by}} Lawrence Sperry and manufactured by the Sperry Gyroscope Company.|$|R
50|$|Airplanes and {{helicopters}} are usually {{equipped with a}} <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator</b> to provide their pilots with a continuous display of the lateral balance of their aircraft so the pilots can ensure coordinated flight.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Schempp-Hirth Janus-C glider Instrument panel {{equipped}} for [...] "cloud flying". The <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator</b> is top centre. The heading indicator {{is replaced by}} a GPS-driven computer with wind and glide data, driving two electronic variometer displays to the right.|$|R
5000|$|This basic six set, {{also known}} as a [...] "six pack", was also adopted by {{commercial}} aviation. After the Second World War the arrangement was changed to: (top row) airspeed, artificial horizon, altimeter, (bottom row) <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator,</b> heading indicator, vertical speed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> slip {{indicator}} can {{be referred to}} as the <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator,</b> although the instrument does not respond directly to bank angle. Neither does the turn coordinator, but it does respond to roll rate, which enables it to respond more quickly to the start of a turn.|$|R
5000|$|When an {{aircraft}} is flying with zero sideslip a <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator</b> {{installed on the}} aircraft’s instrument panel usually shows {{the ball in the}} center of the spirit level. The occupants perceive no lateral acceleration of the aircraft and their weight to be acting straight downward into their seats.|$|R
50|$|It had {{a crew of}} five (six in {{the bomber}} version), with cockpit {{accommodation}} for two pilots sitting side-by-side. Instrumentation in the central panel included oil and fuel gauges, altimeters for low and high altitude (1,000 and 8,000 m), clock, airspeed and vertical speed indicator, gyroscope, compass, artificial horizon, <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator,</b> rev counters <b>and</b> throttles.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to an altimeter, compass, and an airspeed indicator, gliders are often equipped with a variometer, <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>and</b> an airband radio (transceiver), each {{of which may be}} required in some countries. An Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon (ELT) may also be fitted into the glider to reduce search and rescue time in case of an accident.|$|R

The yaw string (red wool) on {{the canopy}} <b>and</b> the <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator</b> (top center of the {{instrument}} panel) both show the glider is not in coordinated flight. The glider is slipping slightly nose-left. Coordinated flight can be restored by the pilot applying pressure to the right rudder pedal.|$|R
50|$|The Boeing 747 had a third backup AI in {{the center}} {{instrument}} panel between the two pilots, and the transcripts of the cockpit conversation show that the flight engineer may have been attempting to direct the captain's attention to that third AI, or perhaps to another instrument called the <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator,</b> just five seconds before the aircraft impacted the sea.|$|R
5000|$|The Gordon was a {{conventional}} two-bay fabric-covered metal biplane. It was powered by [...] variants of the Armstrong Siddeley Panther IIa engine. Armament was one fixed, forward-firing [...]303 in Vickers machine gun and a [...]303 in Lewis Gun {{in the rear}} cockpit, plus 500 lb of bombs. The aircraft was somewhat basic; instruments were airspeed indicator, altimeter, oil pressure gauge, tachometer, <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>and</b> compass.|$|R
50|$|While {{teaching}} flying, Ocker {{became more}} {{acutely aware of}} the hazards of flying into clouds, which invariably disoriented pilots. He began carrying one of the first <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicators,</b> given him by Sperry during their earlier testing. Working with US Army Captain David A. Myers, a flight surgeon at Crissy Field, California, they developed proof of that instrument's trustworthiness and ability to deliver an airplane out of blind-flight conditions, provided the pilot could be convinced to obey its indications rather than his own senses.|$|R
5000|$|Of the old basic six {{instrument}}s, the <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator</b> is now obsolete. The {{instrument was}} included, {{but it was}} of little use in {{the first generation of}} jet airliners. It was removed from many aircraft prior to glass cockpits becoming available. With an improved artificial horizon, including gyros and flight directors, the <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator</b> became needless except when performing certain types of aerobatics (which would not be intentionally performed in IMC to begin with). But the other five flight instruments, sometimes known as [...] "the big five", are still included in all cockpits. The way of displaying them has changed over time, though. In glass cockpits the flight instruments are shown on monitors. But the display is not shown by numbers, but as images of analog instruments. The artificial horizon is given a central place in the monitor, with a heading indicator just below (usually this is displayed only {{as a part of the}} compass). The indicated airspeed, altimeter, and vertical speed indicator are displayed as columns with the indicated airspeed and altitude to the right of the horizon and the vertical speed to the left in the same pattern as in most older style [...] "clock cockpits".|$|R
50|$|In aviation, the <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> slip <b>indicator</b> (T/S, a.k.a. <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator)</b> <b>and</b> the <b>turn</b> {{coordinator}} (TC) variant {{are essentially}} two aircraft flight instruments in one device. One indicates {{the rate of}} turn, or {{the rate of change}} in the aircraft's heading, the other part indicates whether the aircraft is in coordinated flight, showing the slip or skid of the turn. The slip indicator is actually an inclinometer that at rest displays the angle of the aircraft's lateral axis with respect to horizontal, and in motion displays this angle as modified by the acceleration of the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{instruments}} {{required for}} IFR flight {{in addition to}} those that are required for VFR flight are: heading indicator, sensitive altimeter adjustable for barometric pressure, clock with a sweep-second pointer or digital equivalent, attitude indicator, radios and suitable avionics for the route to be flown, alternator or generator, gyroscopic rate-of-turn indicator that is either a turn coordinator or the <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator.</b> From 1999 single-engine helicopters could not be FAA-certified for IFR, and Helicopter Association International estimates that 326 lives were lost in 133 accidents that would likely not have happened if those helicopters had been flying in IFR.|$|R
2500|$|The Air Ministry {{initially}} {{suspected that}} this variant would not work, but tests proved otherwise. Although the gun provided the Mosquito with yet more anti-shipping firepower for use against U-boats, it required a steady approach run to aim and fire the gun, making it vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. The gun had a muzzle velocity of [...] {{and an excellent}} range of some 1,800 – 1,500 yards (1,650 – 1,370 m). It was sensitive to sidewards movement; an attack required a dive from [...] at a 30° angle with the <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator</b> on centre. A move during the dive could jam the gun. The prototype HJ732 was converted from a FB.VI and was first flown on 8 June 1943.|$|R
50|$|The Sala had a plywood covered, ovoid section {{fuselage}} {{with an open}} cockpit immediately {{ahead of}} the wing pedestal. The cockpit lacked a windscreen but was well instrumented for a glider of the day, with air speed <b>indicator,</b> altimeter, <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>and</b> variometer. The fuselage tapered rearwards to the tail where the tailplane, with a straight, swept leading edge and carrying elliptically shaped, aerodynamically balanced elevators, was mounted on top. The fin {{was no more than}} a mounting for the tall, curved, balanced rudder, which extended down to the keel and moved in an elevator cut-out. The standard glider ash skid, running from just aft of the nose to below the wing trailing edge and with a single rubber shock absorber served as an undercarriage, assisted by a very small tail skid.|$|R
50|$|In forward flight, a helicopter's flight {{controls}} behave more {{like those in}} a fixed-wing aircraft. Moving the cyclic forward makes the nose pitch down, thus losing altitude and increasing airspeed. Moving the cyclic back makes the nose pitch up, slowing the helicopter and making it climb. Increasing collective (power) while maintaining a constant airspeed induces a climb, while decreasing collective (power) makes the helicopter descend. Coordinating these two inputs, down collective plus aft (back) cyclic or up collective plus forward cyclic causes airspeed changes while maintaining a constant altitude. The pedals serve the same function in both a helicopter and an airplane, to maintain balanced flight. This is done by applying a pedal input in the direction necessary to center {{the ball in the}} <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{forward flight}} a helicopter's flight {{controls}} behave more {{like those of}} a fixed-wing aircraft. Displacing the cyclic forward will cause the nose to pitch down, with a resultant increase in airspeed and loss of altitude. Aft cyclic will cause the nose to pitch up, slowing the helicopter and causing it to climb. Increasing collective (power) while maintaining a constant airspeed will induce a climb while decreasing collective will cause a descent. Coordinating these two inputs, down collective plus aft cyclic or up collective plus forward cyclic, will result in airspeed changes while maintaining a constant altitude. The pedals serve the same function in both a helicopter and a fixed-wing aircraft, to maintain balanced flight. This is done by applying a pedal input in whichever direction is necessary to center the ball in the <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>indicator.</b>|$|R

50|$|Production of the 19m span Jantar {{commenced}} as the SZD-38 Jantar 1 in 1973 with 57 {{built by}} 1975, 24 for export. The {{success of the}} SZD-37x prototypes in the World Championships was not repeated, due partly to shrinkage of the epoxy resin causing irregularities in the wing surfaces, and partly to the improved performance of the competing aircraft. The SZD-38 broke seven Polish National records in 1973, but was soon out-classed in competitions. The standard instrument fit included Variometer, <b>Turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bank,</b> Compass as well as standard ASI, Altimeter etc.. Provision was also made for an Artificial Horizon and oxygen equipment.|$|R

50|$|Wartime use of {{aircraft}} accelerated {{the development of}} new technologies. Aircraft power plants were vastly different from those that powered buses and lorries. Airframes, with their need to reduce drag and provide control in the air, were a totally new challenge. Armourers were asked to develop new fusing methods for equally new explosive devices like air-dropped bombs. Aircraft electrical systems included bomb release mechanisms and synchronised gun firing through the propeller via the use of an interrupter mechanism. The addition of a third dimension to navigation meant aircraft instrument makers had to produce new indicators for such things as <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank,</b> air speed <b>and</b> an artificial horizon.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, the {{speedway}} underwent more improvements. 19-degree banking {{was added}} in the <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> 16-degree <b>banking</b> in straightaways to assured more safety for drivers and exciting on-car movements for fans. At that time the Orange County Speedway became known as “the fastest 3/8-mile race track in America".|$|R
25|$|The {{swallows}} generally forage for prey {{that is on}} the wing, {{but they}} will on occasion snap prey off branches or on the ground. The flight may be fast and involve a rapid succession of <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>banks</b> when actively chasing fast moving prey; less agile prey may be caught with a slower more leisurely flight that includes flying in circles and bursts of flapping mixed with gliding. Where several species of swallow feed together they will be separated into different niches based on height off the ground, some species feeding closer to the ground and others feeding at higher levels. Similar separation occurs where feeding overlaps with swifts. Niche separation may also occur with the size of prey chosen.|$|R
40|$|A set {{of flight}} tests {{designed}} {{to evaluate the}} relative utility of candidate displays with advanced symbology for general aviation terminal area instrument flight rules operations are discussed. The symbology was previously evaluated {{as part of the}} NASA Langley Research Center's Terminal Configured Vehicle Program for use in commercial airlines. The advanced symbology included vehicle track angle, flight path angle and a perspective representation of the runway. These symbols were selectively drawn on a cathode ray tube (CRT) display along with the roll attitude, pitch attitude, localizer deviation and glideslope deviation. In addition to the CRT display, the instrument panel contained standard <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>bank,</b> altimeter, rate of climb, airspeed, heading, and engine instruments. The symbology was evaluated using tracking performance and pilot subjective ratings for an instrument landing system capture and tracking task...|$|R
