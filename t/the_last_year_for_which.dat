500|$|D. W. Griffith, {{the stroke}} of the Jesus College boat, {{was present at the}} inaugural meeting of the Oxford University Boat Club on 23 April 1839. However, Jesus College oarsmen played an {{infrequent}} part in university rowing in the 19th century. No Jesus College student served on the OUBC committee between 1839 and 1899, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>which</b> Sherwood gives records. Two students from the college (W.S.Thompson and E.W.Davies (cox)) were part of the losing Oxford crew in the second Oxford–Cambridge boat race in 1836. Between 1858 and 1899, seven others trialled, unsuccessfully, for places in the Oxford University crew. Since then, college representation in the Boat Race has been more frequent: M.L.Thomas and D.R.Glynne Jones (1952) and M.L. Thomas (President, 1953); Boris Mavra (1992, 1993 and 1995); the Canadian 2004 Olympic rowing silver medallist Barney Williams (2005 and 2006); and Brodie Buckland (2007). Justin Hutchinson rowed for Oxford's reserve crew, known as Isis, in the 2002 and 2003 Boat Races, as did Tim Farquharson, an undergraduate studying Engineering Science, in 2009.
