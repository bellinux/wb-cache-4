5|$|Miking a Leslie is also {{important}} in a recording studio, as the choice and positioning of microphones determines the overall recorded sound. A popular recommendation is two Shure SM57s on <b>the</b> <b>horn</b> and a Sennheiser MD421 on the drum. Recording Magazine's Dave Martin suggests a similar setup, with various microphone models used as stereo pairs on <b>the</b> <b>horn</b> but using an Electro-Voice RE20 on the drum instead. Keith Emerson recorded his Leslie using a single mic each on <b>the</b> <b>horn</b> and the drum, but with the covers removed.|$|E
5|$|Blessed Lightning, a monk at the monastery, has {{a vision}} of Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, and Tharkey in danger. Tintin regains {{consciousness}} and, too weak to walk, gives Snowy a note to deliver. Snowy runs to the monastery, loses the message, but is recognised as the dog from Blessed Lightning's vision. Tintin, Haddock and Tharkey regain consciousness in the monastery and are brought before the Grand Abbot. The Abbot tells Tintin to abandon his quest, but Blessed Lightning has another vision, through which Tintin learns that Chang is still alive inside a mountain cave at <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> of the Yak—and that the Yeti is also there. Tintin and Haddock travel on to <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> of the Yak.|$|E

5000|$|A {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} <b>the</b> <b>horns</b> of adult male African buffalo is fusion of their bases, forming a continuous bone shield {{referred to as}} a [...] "boss". From <b>the</b> base, <b>the</b> <b>horns</b> diverge downwards, then smoothly curve upwards and outwards. In large bulls, the distance between the ends of <b>the</b> <b>horns</b> can reach upwards of one metre. <b>The</b> <b>horns</b> form fully when the animal reaches the age of five or six years. In cows, <b>the</b> <b>horns</b> are, on average, 10-20% smaller, and the boss is less prominent. Forest buffalo horns are smaller than those of the savannah buffalo, usually measuring less than 40 cm, and are almost never fused.|$|R

Aurochs horns could reach 80 cm {{in length and}} between 10 and 20 cm in diameter. <b>The</b> <b>horns</b> of bulls were larger, with the curvature more strongly expressed than in cows. <b>The</b> <b>horns</b> grew from <b>the</b> skull at a 60° angle to the muzzle, facing forwards.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Horned</b> Rat is {{primarily}} worshipped {{out of fear}} of retribution and is a cruel god. Unlike most Gods in the Warhammer setting <b>the</b> <b>Horned</b> Rat actually manifested once. During the Second Skaven Civil War the Grey Seers performed a ritual intended to summon <b>the</b> <b>Horned</b> One. It succeeded and <b>the</b> <b>Horned</b> One appeared, devouring many Skaven and proclaiming that they must work to take the surface for themselves. It bestowed upon them the Pillar of Commandments, a thirteen-sided pillar each with thirteen commandments. It is unknown what is written on them but it seems to dictate Skaven society and the rule of the Council of Thirteen. The centre of <b>the</b> <b>Horned</b> Rat's cult is located in Skavenblight, and is maintained by the Grey Seers, a sect of horned Skaven numbering at 169 (13 x 13) members with grey fur that possess magic.|$|R

5|$|Archaeological, biogeographical, and {{linguistic}} evidence {{suggest that the}} donkey was first domesticated by nomadic pastoral people in North Africa over 5,000 years ago.

Genetic evidence finds that the donkey was domesticated twice based on two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. It also points to a single ancestor, the Nubian wild ass. Attempts to domesticate zebras were largely unsuccessful, though Walter Rothschild trained some to draw a carriage in England.|$|E
5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply be {{connected}} to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the built-in amplifier is too quiet. This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power amplifier. Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed on opposite sides of <b>the</b> <b>horn</b> and a single microphone on the drum.|$|E
5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle has closely {{associated}} with the legend of Sir Guy the Seeker since at least the early 19th century. Different versions of the story vary slightly in their details, but typically involve a knight, Sir Guy, arriving at Dunstanburgh Castle, where he was met by a wizard and led inside. There he comes across a noble lady imprisoned inside a crystal tomb and guarded by a sleeping army. The wizard offers Guy a choice of either a sword or a hunting horn to help free the lady; he incorrectly chooses <b>the</b> <b>horn,</b> which wakes the sleeping knights. Sir Guy finds himself outside Dunstanburgh Castle, and spends {{the rest of his life}} attempting to find a way back inside.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>horns</b> of a British {{primitive}} normally form a [...] "scimitar" [...] or [...] "dorcas" [...] twist. <b>The</b> <b>horns</b> emerge {{high and}} {{parallel with the}} line of <b>the</b> forehead. <b>The</b> <b>horns</b> are thick at the base, and are often wide apart.

2500|$|Whilst <b>the</b> <b>Horned</b> God is <b>the</b> {{most common}} {{depiction}} of masculine divinity in Wicca, {{he is not}} the only representation. Other examples include the Green Man and the Sun God. In traditional Wicca, however, these other representations of the Wiccan god are subsumed or amalgamated into <b>the</b> <b>Horned</b> God, as aspects or expressions of him. Sometimes this is shown by adding horns or antlers to the iconography. The Green Man, for example, may be shown with branches resembling antlers; and the Sun God may be depicted with a crown or halo of solar rays, that may resemble horns. These other conceptions of the Wiccan god should not be regarded as displacing <b>the</b> <b>Horned</b> God, but rather as elaborating on various facets of his nature. Doreen Valiente has called <b>the</b> <b>Horned</b> God [...] "the eldest of gods" [...] in both The Witches Creed and also in her Invocation To <b>The</b> <b>Horned</b> God.|$|R
