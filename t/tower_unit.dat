40|$|The Yukon-Tanana terrane (YTT) is a {{composite}} arc built on the rifted margin of western North America. The YTT {{is present in the}} southeastern part of the St. Cyr area in south-central Yukon, but in the northwest section the structural and lithologic relationships are poorly known. This study describes the structural geometry of the northwest section of the St. Cyr area, west of the Canol Road. The lithological, geochemical, and geochronological characteristics of the <b>Tower</b> Peak <b>unit</b> are investigated in an effort to determine its origin and terrane affinity. In the study area, the <b>Tower</b> Peak <b>unit</b> sits tectonically above a low-grade mafic-ultramafic unit. In turn, this mafic-ultramafic unit is thrust over phyllite and marble creating {{a composite}} klippe. Detrital zircons from the marble indicate a maximum depositional age of 368 Ma. This result is consistent with the footwall being part of the Devonian to Mississippian Finlayson assemblage, the oldest arc of the composite YTT. The <b>Tower</b> Peak <b>unit</b> is a massive but fractured, sub-greenschist facies metabasalt. Whole-rock and trace element geochemistry of four Tower Peak samples suggest an oceanic or island arc setting for deposition of the <b>Tower</b> Peak <b>unit.</b> Zircons separated from three samples of the <b>Tower</b> Peak <b>unit</b> give a range of U-Pb ion probe ages. Three distinct age populations exist: 600 - 2582 Ma, 433 - 303 Ma, and 140 - 190 Ma. The preferred interpretation is that the <b>Tower</b> Peak <b>unit</b> is Mesozoic in age and may derive from Stikinia or Quesnellia...|$|R

40|$|In this work, an {{optimization}} model that considers thermal and hydraulic interactions is developed for a cooling water system. It is a closed loop {{consisting of a}} cooling <b>tower</b> <b>unit,</b> circulation pump, blower and heat exchanger-pipe network. Aside from process disturbances, climatic fluctuations are considered. Model constraints include relations concerning tower performance, air flowrate requirement, make-up flowrate, circulating pump performance, heat load in each cooler, pressure drop constraints and climatic conditions. The objective function is operating cost minimization. Optimization variables are air flowrate, forced water withdrawal upstream the tower, and valve adjustment in each branch. It is found that the most significant operating cost is related to electricity. However, for cooled water temperatures lower than a specific target, {{there must be a}} forced withdrawal of circulating water and further makeup to enhance the cooling tower capacity. Additionally, the system is optimized along the months. The results corroborate the fact that the most important variable on cooling tower performance is not the air temperature itself, but its humidity...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{compares the}} RC {{structure}} of a cooling <b>tower</b> <b>unit</b> under seismic loads and under strong wind loads. The calculated values of the envelopes of the displacements and the internal forces due to seismic loading states are compared with the envelopes of the loading states due to the dead, operational and live loads, wind and temperature actions. The seismic effect {{takes into account the}} seismic area of ground motion 0. 3 g and the ductility properties of a relatively rigid structure. The ductility is assessed as the reduction in seismic load. In this case the actions of wind pressure are higher than the seismicity effect under ductility correction. The seismic effects, taking into account the ductility properties of the structure, are lower than the actions of the wind pressure. The other static loads, especially temperature action due to the environment and surface insulation are very important for the design of the structure. ...|$|E
