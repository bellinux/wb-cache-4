40|$|This paper {{describes}} an abstract framework called valuation network for computation of marginals using local computation. In valuation networks, we represent knowledge using functions called valuations. Making inferences involves using two operators called marginalisation and combination. Marginalisation <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> coarsen a valuation by eliminating some variables. Combination <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> combine valuations. Making inferences from a valuation network can be simply described as finding the marginal {{of the joint}} valuation for each variable of interest. The joint valuation is the combination of all valuations. We state some simple axioms that marginalisation and combination need to satisfy to enable us to computer marginals using local computation. We describe a fusion algorithm for computing a marginal using local computation. We describe the fusion algorithm as a message passing in join tree algorithm. [...] ...|$|R

60|$|This is {{a glorious}} text, and one {{fit to be}} the key-note of Christmas-day. If we will take it to heart, it will <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> keep Christmas-day. St. Paul has been {{speaking}} of two good women, {{who seem to have}} had some difference; and he beseeches them to make up their difference, and be of the same mind in the Lord. And then he goes on to tell them, and all Christian people, why they should make up their differences.|$|E
60|$|XXV. Now, of Proportion so {{much has}} been written, that I believe the only facts which are of {{practical}} use have been overwhelmed and kept out of sight by vain accumulations of particular instances and estimates. Proportions are as infinite (and that {{in all kinds of}} things, as severally in colors, lines, shades, lights, and forms) as possible airs in music: and it is just as rational an attempt to teach a young architect how to proportion truly and well by calculating for him the proportions of fine works, as it would be to teach him to compose melodies by calculating the mathematical relations of the notes in Beethoven's Adelaïde or Mozart's Requiem. The man who has eye and intellect will invent beautiful proportions, and cannot help it; but he can no more <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do it than Wordsworth could <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> write a sonnet, or than Scott could have told us how to plan a romance. But there are one or two general laws which can be told: they are of no use, indeed, except as preventives of gross mistake, but they are so far worth telling and remembering; and the more so because, in the discussion of the subtle laws of proportion (which will never be either numbered or known), architects are perpetually forgetting and transgressing the very simplest of its necessities.|$|E
30|$|Fluid {{resuscitation}} is {{a crucial}} component of initial resuscitation in major burn patients to avoid early mortality. Large amount of intravenous fluids are given {{during this period of}} time no matter Parkland formula or other formulae are used as the fluid resuscitation guidelines. Furthermore, it is a trend to administrate even larger amount of intravenous fluids in these years, which is known as “fluid creep” phenomenon [1]. However, excessive intravenous fluids would produce generalized and lung edema, which may preclude wound healing and prolong intubation. Besides, no guideline <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> adjust intravenous fluids after the first 48  hours.|$|R

It is the {{business}} of scientists to tell, and another ancient philosopher <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> tell: Aristotle sought to understand phenomena—and communicate that knowledge— by identifying their four 2 ̆ 2 [be]causes 2 ̆ 2, which he called material, final, efficient, and formal.

"But, after all, {{it would}} be a mockery on the old dame's part," [...] said the young man, {{somewhat}} bitterly, [...] "since she would thus hold the desired thing seemingly within our reach; but because she never <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> prepare and obtain its efficacy, we miss it just as much as if all the ingredients were hidden from sight and knowledge in the centre of the earth.

6000|$|We read to-day, for {{the first}} lesson, parts of the prophecy of Amos. [...] They are {{somewhat}} difficult, here and there, to understand; but nevertheless Amos is perhaps the grandest of the Hebrew prophets, next to Isaiah. Rough and homely as his words are, there is a strength, a majesty, and a terrible earnestness in them, which {{it is good to}} listen to; and specially good now that Advent draws near, and we have to think of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and what His coming means.

But she's a nice woman. She'll probably fix up the rest-room, and the rest-room is a fine thing, brings a lot of business to town.

60|$|If Satan {{would only}} come! That was my {{constant}} thought. He could invent {{some way to}} win the case; for he had {{said it would be}} won, so he necessarily knew how it could be done. But the days dragged on, and still he did not come. Of course I did not doubt that it would be won, and that Father Peter would be happy {{for the rest of his}} life, since Satan had said so; yet I knew I should be much more comfortable if he would come and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> manage it.

40|$|For {{applications}} like ion implantation, rf linacs using double-gap structures {{with external}} resonators {{can be used}} because they are practical at low frequencies. However, since the two gaps associated with a given resonator can-not be individually phased, it is not obvious <b>how</b> <b>to</b> build a linac that can efficiently accelerate particles having dif-ferent mass/charge ratios. This paper describes the beam dynamics of double-gap rf linacs and shows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> maxi-mize the range of mass/charge ratios.

This chapter aims to investigate this issue of conceptualising purposeful systems and to discuss the role that goal driven approaches can play to resolve it. It considers the challenge of new systems having a multifaceted purpose and shows how intention/strategy maps help facing this challenge...|$|R
