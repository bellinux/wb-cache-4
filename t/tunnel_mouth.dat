5|$|Below {{the bridge}} is a small island, after which an {{artificial}} cut built to avoid the circuitous route of the River Rother Navigation heads westwards. The river now discharges over a weir {{at the site of}} the former Hardham corn mill to join the Arun a little further downstream, and the junction is followed by another small island. Hardham lock was necessary because of the drop in levels caused by the mill, and the branch through Hardham tunnel headed due south a little further up the Rother. Exploration of the tunnel was described by an article in Sussex County Magazine in 1953, when both ends were accessible, and again in 2012, when only the southern end was explored. A waterworks has been built over the bed of the canal at the northern end, and the <b>tunnel</b> <b>mouth</b> is within the site. The river continues in a large loop to the east. The Arun Valley railway line crosses it to reach Pulborough railway station. There is another island, with the A29 road crossing both channels. Pulborough Brooks nature reserve is to the east of the loop, and the course then meanders westwards to Greatham Bridge. The bridge consists of eight low elliptical arches, two taller arches, a cast iron span over the navigable channel, and a solid ramp to the east. Although its construction suggests that it is medieval, most of the arches were erected in 1827.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to extending the Market Street subway tunnel west to 46th Street, with new stations at 30th, 34th and 40th streets, a new trolley tunnel was built under Market, Ludlow and 36th {{streets and the}} former Woodland Avenue, leading to a new western portal at 40th Street for routes 11, 13, 34 and 36 (route 10 trolleys use a separate portal at 36th and Ludlow). New stations for the trolleys were constructed at 22nd, 30th, 33rd (between Market and Ludlow), 36th (at Sansom), and 37th (at Spruce) streets. The 24th Street trolley station and tunnel portal was abandoned. The <b>tunnel</b> <b>mouth</b> was visible from Market Street until the Philadelphia Gas and Electric Company (now PECO) built an office building on the site in 1969.|$|E

25|$|From Windmill End Junction, Line No. 2 {{continues}} {{towards the}} closed Lapal Tunnel. This {{was once an}} area of industry, {{but most of it}} has gone, to be replaced by housing estates, light industrial units, and playing fields. At the northern end of Gosty Tunnel, a layby marks the site when a tug was once kept to pull barges through the tunnel. Beyond lies Hawne Basin, refurbished as a marina after its use as a railway interchange ceased in 1967. The head of navigation is just beyond the basin entrance. Much of the remaining route to the <b>tunnel</b> <b>mouth</b> is traceable, and the Lapal Tunnel Trust have carried out some restoration, as they have also done on the section from the eastern portal to the Worcester and Birmingham Canal at Selly Oak.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} argued that the size and {{technology}} of these revisions was so great that the credit for its design should go to Barlow and Hawkshaw. The towers remained in rough stone, rather than being finished in the Egyptian style. Work on the bridge was restarted in 1862. Initially a temporary bridge was created by pulling ropes across the gorge and making a footway of wire ropes with wood planks held together with iron hoops. This was used by the workers to move a [...] "traveller", consisting of a light frame on wheels, to transport each link individually, which would eventually make up the chains supporting the bridge. The chains are anchored in tapering tunnels, [...] long, {{on either side of the}} bridge and plugs of Staffordshire blue brick infilled to prevent the chains being pulled out of the narrower <b>tunnel</b> <b>mouth.</b> After completion of the chains, vertical suspension rods were hung from the links in the chains and large girders hung from these. The girders on either side then support the deck, which is [...] higher at the Clifton end than at Leigh Woods so that it gives the impression of being horizontal. The strength of the structure was tested by spreading 500tons of stone over the bridge. This caused it to sag by , but within the expected tolerances. During this time a tunnel was driven through the rocks on the Leigh Woods side beneath the bridge to carry the Bristol Port Railway to Avonmouth. The construction work was completed in 1864–111 years after a bridge at the site was first planned.|$|E

2500|$|Queen Street signal box, {{opened in}} 1881, {{was on a}} gantry {{spanning}} the tracks close to the <b>tunnel</b> <b>mouth.</b> It closed on 26 February 1967 when control of the high level station was transferred to a panel in Cowlairs signal box. That box was superseded by the new Cowlairs signalling centre on 28 December 1998. [...] This in turn was abolished in October 2013 and the station is now {{under the supervision of}} Edinburgh IECC (which will eventually become the Edinburgh Rail Operating Centre).|$|E
2500|$|After {{the yard}} had taken shape, the next job was the tunnel. [...] The {{approach}} to the tunnel was about 6 chains long and up to [...] deep. [...] The line entered the tunnel on a downward grade of 1 in 1,000, steepening to a grade of 1 in 15 at the eastern portal. [...] At that end a small drainage tunnel had to be built to divert a stream that had flowed down a steep gully where the <b>tunnel</b> <b>mouth</b> was to be. [...] The maximum height of the tunnel was [...] above the floor: once rails were laid the maximum clearance was [...] The width of the tunnel varied from [...] at the floor to [...] at [...] above the floor. [...] Despite castigation from various parties, {{it was not until}} March 1877 that work on both ends of the tunnel met at the middle, having taken {{three and a half years}} to complete.|$|E
2500|$|An Act of Parliament was {{obtained}} in 1803 {{which gave the}} proprietors the power to raise £50,000 in £50 shares {{for the construction of}} the canal. The land was donated by the Duke, who took 125 of the 1000 shares. Taylor, who also managed Wheal Friendship mine, acted as engineer, and work started in August 1803. The largest engineering feature of the canal was a tunnel under Morwell Down. When cutting of it began, copper ore was discovered close to the Tavistock end, and this became the Wheal Crebor mine, which was managed as a separate project. It had its own entrance, by the tunnel entrance, and used water-powered machinery, driven by water flowing along the canal. The canal from Tavistock to the <b>tunnel</b> <b>mouth,</b> including an aqueduct which carried it over the River Lumburn, was opened in 1805. The [...] tunnel was cut through rock, was of small bore, and required Taylor to construct two types of pump, one to keep the workings drained, and the other to clean the air. Both were powered by water wheels, driven by the canal water. The tunnel, which was driven through elvan rock and killas clay-slate, is [...] below Morwell Down at its deepest point, and it was finished in 1816.|$|E
50|$|At the Box Flat Mine in Swanbank, South East Queensland, 17 miners {{were lost}} after an {{underground}} gas explosion occurred on 31 July 1972.

60|$|Also another trouble stared {{us in the}} face; {{our supply}} of the crude mineral oil which the Abati used for {{lighting}} purposes was beginning to run low.

6000|$|Now, gentleman, in my {{application}} of this story, I exactly reverse my friend the captain's anecdote, and I entreat the public in looking about to consider who are fit subjects for their bounty, to give each his hand with something in it, and not award a dry hand to the industrious railway servant who is always at his back. And I would ask any one with a doubt upon this subject to consider what his experience of the railway servant is {{from the time of}} his departure to his arrival at his destination. I know what mine is. Here he is, in velveteen or in a policeman's dress, scaling cabs, storming carriages, finding lost articles by a sort of instinct, binding up lost umbrellas and walking sticks, wheeling trucks, counselling old ladies, with a wonderful interest in their affairs- -mostly very complicated--and sticking labels upon all sorts of articles. I look around--there he is, in a station-master's uniform, directing and overseeing, with the head of a general, and with the courteous manners of a gentleman; {{and then there is the}} handsome figure of the guard, who inspires confidence in timid passengers. I glide out of the station, and there he is again with his flags in his hand at his post in the open country, at the level crossing, at the cutting, at the <b>tunnel</b> <b>mouth,</b> and at every station on the road until our destination is reached. In regard, therefore, to the railway servants with whom we do come into contact, we may surely have some natural sympathy, and it is on their behalf that I this night appeal to you. I beg now to propose [...] "Success to the Railway Benevolent Society." ...|$|E

5000|$|Live Rails is {{an album}} by {{musician}} Steve Hackett.

A related release to this one is the Fire and Ice DVD, also recorded around the same time, which includes more emphasis on Genesis-era tracks.|$|R
2500|$|There is {{restricted}} personnel {{access to the}} tunnel at Sudbrook Pumping Station, where an iron ladder descends in the shaft of the water pumping main; the ventilation air is pumped in at this point also. The GWR original ventilation arrangement was to extract air at Sudbrook, but the exhaust gases from steam train operation led to premature corrosion of the fan mechanism. [...] When the Cornish pumping engines were replaced in the 1960s the draughting was reversed so that atmospheric air is pumped into the tunnel exhausting at the <b>tunnel</b> <b>mouths.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1837 a woollen mill, {{as well as}} the {{previously}} noted combined corn and saw mill, were present, all drawing water from the aforementioned cistern and lade, {{about a quarter of a}} mile upstream. As stated, the lade was tunnelled through the soft red sandstone of the river gorge, and the <b>tunnel</b> <b>mouths</b> can still be seen, as can two stone arched footbridges over the lade, and an overflow sluice. No traces of the woollen mill, which in 1837 employed thirty persons spinning yarn for a Kilmarnock carpet factory, have survived. This mill was the first in sequence to receive the lade waters.|$|R
50|$|They {{are based}} on a single running loop, {{although}} twisted into overlapping curves. The baseboard is small, typically 4 x 2 ft, but a long running line fits in, owing to the curves. Their purpose is to show a continuously moving train, lurching from side to side across reverse curves, with unpredictable re-appearances from the <b>tunnel</b> <b>mouths.</b> Points are few, a single decorative siding, or a passing loop to allow two trains to be run in turn. Some layouts in the 1970s used the early transistorised control circuits then becoming available to run automatically, switching between trains as each entered the loop.|$|R
