5|$|The pyramid was {{excavated}} at {{the beginning}} of the 20th century by two different teams who reported conflicting estimates regarding its size and number of subterranean chambers. No artefacts were found over the course of the excavations, and no <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> burial could be found. For this reason, it is unclear whether the pyramid was used to bury a pharaoh or was abandoned following the premature death of the king.|$|E
5|$|While the pugs {{that are}} {{depicted}} in eighteenth century prints {{tend to be}} long and lean, modern breed preferences are for a square cobby body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle.

The markings are clearly defined, {{and there is a}} <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> black line extending from the occiput to the tail. The tail normally curls tightly over the hip.|$|E

They travel to K7, and scans {{indicate}} that the bomb is in the grain storage compartments. They enter the compartments and discover that the poisoned grain has all been eaten by tribbles, who are now all dead. Suddenly Captain Kirk opens the compartment and is covered in falling tribbles. Dax and Sisko find the bomb before it can kill Kirk and the Defiant transports it into space where it explodes. The crew of the Defiant use the Bajoran Orb to travel {{back to the present}} time, and Sisko finishes explaining the situation to the Temporal Agents. The episode ends with Quark (Armin Shimerman) in his bar on Deep Space Nine's promenade, with numerous tribbles around him.|$|E

5|$|Despite Lady Tichborne's {{insistence that}} the Claimant was her son, {{the rest of the}} Tichbornes and their related {{families}} were almost unanimous in declaring him a fraud. They recognised Alfred Tichborne's infant son, Henry Alfred, as the 12th baronet. Lady Doughty, Sir Edward's widow, had initially accepted the evidence from Australia but changed her mind soon after the Claimant's arrival in England. Lady Tichborne's brother Henry Seymour denounced the Claimant as false when he found that the latter neither spoke nor understood French (Roger's first language as a child) and lacked any <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> French accent. The Claimant was unable to identify several family members and complained about attempts to catch him out by presenting him with impostors. Vincent Gosford, a former Tichborne Park steward, was unimpressed by the Claimant, who, when asked to name the contents of a sealed package that Roger left with Gosford before his departure in 1853, said he could not remember. The family believed that the Claimant had acquired from Bogle and other sources information that enabled him to demonstrate some knowledge of the family's affairs, including, for example, the locations of certain pictures in Tichborne Park. Apart from Lady Tichborne, a distant cousin, Anthony John Wright Biddulph, was the only relation who accepted the Claimant as genuine; however, as long as Lady Tichborne was alive and maintaining her support, the Claimant's position remained strong.|$|E

25|$|Trace fossils are not body casts. The Ediacara biota, for instance, {{primarily}} {{comprises the}} casts of organisms in sediment. Similarly, a footprint {{is not a}} simple replica of the sole of the foot, and the resting <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> seastar has different details than an impression of a seastar.|$|E
25|$|As {{there are}} no {{contemporary}} documents recording {{the foundation of the}} castle, it is uncertain when and by whom it was started, but it is supposed that Roger de Poitou, the Norman lord in control of the Honour of Lancaster, was responsible. If it was Roger who began construction, the structure would have been built of timber, probably incorporating the earthworks of the Roman fort into its defences. The form of the original castle is unknown. There is no <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> motte, so {{it may have been a}} ringwork– a circular defended enclosure.|$|E
25|$|The Miohippus {{population}} that {{remained on the}} steppes {{is believed to be}} ancestral to Parahippus, a North American animal {{about the size of a}} small pony, with a prolonged skull and a facial structure resembling the horses of today. Its third toe was stronger and larger, and carried the main weight of the body. Its four premolars resembled the molar teeth; the first were small and almost nonexistent. The incisor teeth, like those of its predecessors, had a crown (like human incisors); however, the top incisors had a <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shallow crease marking the beginning of the core/cup.|$|E

Richard Quick Mann was a custom and excise man specialising in breweries and has been found in the records and this may be the real name of Mary Ann Cotton's alleged lover.|$|E
25|$|The second Versailles version (267 × 230cm; 105 × 90½in) shows a {{black and}} white horse with {{complete}} tack but lacking the martingale. The girth is red. The cloak is orange-red, the collar is black, and the embroidery of the gauntlet is very simple and almost unnoticeable. The scarf tied around Napoleon's waist is light blue. The officer with the sabre is again masked by the tail of the horse. Napoleon's features are older, he has shorter hair, and—as in the Charlottenburg version—there is the faint <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smile. The embroidery and the style of the bicorne suggest that the picture was completed after 1804. The picture is not dated but is signed L.DAVID.|$|E
25|$|The first archeological <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{human in}} the area is about five {{thousand}} years old. The Sarmatians invaded {{the area in the}} first century B.C.; since then the area has been continuously inhabited by a variety of cultures. János Hornyik, the first town historian, believed that the settlement known as Partiskum of the Sarmatian Jazygian was here. Contemporary consensus among historians is that it is more likely permanent settlement occurred only after the Hungarian conquest. At the beginning of the 13th century, there were seven villages {{in the area}}, each with a population of 200-300 formed near the village church, a typical rural pattern. They were all destroyed by the Mongol Invasion. Some of the villages revived {{at the time of the}} Cumanian's colonization.|$|E

25|$|The {{establishment}} of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, however, brought the redrawing of administrative regions into banates that purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines, removing any <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Bosnian entity. Serbo-Croat tensions over the structuring of the Yugoslav state continued, {{with the concept of}} a separate Bosnian division receiving little or no consideration. The famous Cvetković-Maček agreement that created the Croatian banate in 1939 encouraged what was essentially a partition of Bosnia between Croatia and Serbia. However, outside political circumstances forced Yugoslav politicians to shift their attention to the rising threat posed by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany. Following a period that saw attempts at appeasement, the joining of the Tripartite Pact, and a coup d'état, Yugoslavia was finally invaded by Germany on 6 April 1941.|$|E
25|$|Though the Lord of the Isles {{had a large}} {{fleet of}} galleys in the 13th and 14th centuries, there appears little or no <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Scots navy during the Wars of Scottish Independence. With Scottish {{independence}} established, Robert the Bruce {{turned his attention to}} the upbuilding of Scots shipping and of a Scots navy. In his later days he visited the Western Isles, which was part of the domain of the powerful Lords of the Isles who owed only a loose allegiance to him, and established a royal castle at East Loch Tarbert in Argyll to overawe the semi-independent Islemen. The Exchequer Rolls of 1326 record the feudal services of certain of his vassals on the western coast in aiding him with their vessels and crews. Near his palace at Cardross on the River Clyde he spent his last days in shipbuilding; and one royal man-of-war of the Viking type at least was equipped by him before he died in 1329.|$|E

500|$|One of Æthelberht's laws {{seems to}} {{preserve}} a <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> very old custom: the third item in the code states that [...] "If the king is drinking at a man's home, and anyone commits any evil deed there, he is to pay twofold compensation."

500|$|The Gordo group, which erupted 6–4 mya {{following}} a probable 2-million-year hiatus, {{is located in}} the southern and western parts of the cluster.

One of the larger centres of the cluster, Gordo is associated with a lava field on its western side that is dated 4.9 mya. Cerro Puquíos and Cerro Negro (5.81–5.28 mya) lie on the southern side of the cluster, and glacial cirques cutting their northeastern flanks reveal layers of scoria and lavas.
