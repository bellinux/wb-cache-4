500|$|For {{the first}} time in the Bond series, Fleming {{encountered}} harsh criticism. The most virulent came from Paul Johnson of the New Statesman, who opened his review, [...] "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism", with: [...] "I have just finished what is, without doubt, the nastiest book I have ever read". He went on to say that [...] "by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> third of the way through, I had to suppress a strong impulse to throw the thing away". Although he recognised that Bond represented [...] "a social phenomenon of some importance", he saw this as a negative element, as the phenomenon concerned [...] "three basic ingredients in Dr. No, all unhealthy, all thoroughly English: the sadism of a schoolboy bully, the mechanical, two-dimensional sex-longings of a frustrated adolescent, and the crude, snob-cravings of a suburban adult". Johnson saw no positives in Dr. No, saying that [...] "Mr Fleming has no literary skill, the construction of the book is chaotic, and entire incidents and situations are inserted, and then forgotten, in a haphazard manner." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} five books (Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, Moonraker, Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love) Fleming {{received}} broadly positive reviews. That began to change in March 1958 when Bernard Bergonzi, in the journal Twentieth Century, attacked Fleming's work as containing [...] "a strongly marked streak of voyeurism and sado-masochism" [...] and wrote that the books showed [...] "the total lack of any ethical frame of reference". The article compared Fleming unfavourably with John Buchan and Raymond Chandler on both moral and literary criteria. A month later, Dr. No was published, and Fleming received harsh criticism {{from a number of}} reviewers who, in the words of Ben Macintyre, [...] "rounded on Fleming, almost as a pack". The most strongly worded of the critiques came from Paul Johnson of the New Statesman, who, in his review [...] "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism", called the novel [...] "without doubt, the nastiest book I have ever read". Johnson {{went on to say that}} [...] "by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> third of the way through, I had to suppress a strong impulse to throw the thing away". Although Johnson recognised that in Bond there [...] "was a social phenomenon of some importance", this was seen as a negative element, as the phenomenon concerned [...] "three basic ingredients in Dr No, all unhealthy, all thoroughly English: the sadism of a schoolboy bully, the mechanical, two-dimensional sex-longings of a frustrated adolescent, and the crude, snob-cravings of a suburban adult."

2500|$|There was {{a decline}} in {{production}} of Liberian goods in the late 19th century, and the government struggled financially, resulting in indebtedness {{on a series of}} international loans. On July 16, 1892, Martha Ann Erskine Ricks met Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle and presented her a hand made quilt, Liberia's first diplomatic gift. Born into slavery in Tennessee, Ricks stated, [...] "I had heard it often, from the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> child, how good the Queen had been to my people – to slaves – and how she wanted us to be free." ...|$|E

40|$|Extract] In 1963 A KINDLY {{professor}} of English ignored prevailing opinion that Waugh was "too lightweight for serious study", {{listened to my}} contention that Waugh's lightness plumbed interesting depths and approved my proposal to write a dissertation on Brideshead Revisited. Some days later a norma:Jly businesslike acquaintance asked about my topic; in return I asked whether she had read the novel. Uneasy silence followed. Then, with unbusinesslike shyness she replied: "Thirty-seven <b>times.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> alcoholic, and <b>I</b> feel so close to Sebastian that I can 't stop reading the book. ...|$|R

60|$|It was {{not until}} the year 1854 that my {{literary}} path was opened up. At that <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> partner in the late publishing firm of Thomas Constable and Company of Edinburgh. Happening one day to meet with the late William Nelson, publisher, I was asked by him how I should like the idea of taking to literature as a profession. My answer I forget. It must have been vague, for I had never thought of the subject at all.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} laughed joyously. [...] "Because it hasn't been opened in that whole <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little chap {{of three or}} four bothering round here when my mother put the things in; I believe it was a great frolic for me, but I'm afraid it wasn't for her.

6000|$|I had {{not done}} much, but I had made that nun speak. She said [...] "Eza."

I fancied that she might have been one of those elderly single women who become Baedeker tourists, and, having tired of this sort of thing, had concluded to devote her life to the work of the House of Martha. But this was mere idle conjecture. She had spoken, and I should not indulge in pessimism.|$|E
60|$|By this <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little awake; for I thought, when I {{first began}} to awake, that I {{had been in a}} sweet sleep; but as I said above, I {{wondered}} where I was, how I came upon the ground, and what was the matter: in a word, a few minutes after, as sense returned, I felt pain, though I did not know where; I clapped my hand to my head, and took it away bloody; then I felt my head ache, and then, in another moment, memory returned, and every thing was present to me again.|$|E
