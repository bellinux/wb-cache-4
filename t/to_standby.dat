5|$|Regarding battle, Golden Sun games contain both random monster encounters, {{featuring}} {{randomly selected}} enemies, and compulsory battles involving set enemies, which advance the story. When a battle begins, a separate screen is brought {{up where the}} player's party and enemy party face-off on opposing sides. During a battle, the characters and the background rotate to give a pseudo-3D effect. Players can attack enemies directly {{using a variety of}} weapons and offensive Psynergy spells, or by summoning Djinn, powerful other-worldly entities that enhance an attached character's hit points, Psynergy points, and other statistics, as well as determining what Psynergy the character is able to perform. Djinns can be set <b>to</b> <b>standby,</b> where players forfeit stat enhancements in order to unleash a powerful one-time attack where the player summons an elemental monster to inflict damage on every enemy.|$|E
500|$|In combat, a Djinni {{has several}} uses. Each Set Djinni {{has a special}} ability which can be invoked during combat by the {{character}} it is attached to, which can include enhanced elemental attacks, buffing/debuffing spells, healing/restoration spells, and other effects. After a successful invoke, the Djinni shifts to [...] "Standby" [...] mode until it is [...] "Set" [...] on the character again. While in standby, the Djinn do not contribute to statistics or change character classes, but {{can be used for}} summon spells, which are attacks where the player summons a powerful elemental monster to inflict damage on every enemy and increases the respective characters affinity for that element for a duration. This is the game's most powerful method of attack, but the required switch <b>to</b> <b>Standby</b> mode is a risky trade-off: Djinn used for summoning must rest for several turns before reverting to the Set position, during which time they cannot bolster statistics or classes. There are sixteen Summon Sequences in Golden Sunfour for each elementand each summon sequence requires between one and four Djinn of the same element on Standby.|$|E
2500|$|A {{veteran of}} the US Navy, Panetti's defense at trial {{was that he was}} {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity. Standby counsel related that Panetti's {{behavior}} was [...] "scary", [...] "bizarre", and [...] "trance-like." [...] It was evident <b>to</b> <b>standby</b> counsel, based on Panetti's behavior both in private and before the jury, that Panetti was not competent, and that his behavior made a farce and mockery of the judicial process. Panetti had also allegedly stopped taking his medication a few months before the trial. Indeed, two months after the end of the trial, the trial court found Panetti incompetent to waive his right to state habeas counsel. Nevertheless, Panetti was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death.|$|E

30|$|Security {{is also an}} {{essential}} aspect for HA Clouds; however, none of the presented solutions deals with security mechanisms, such as those protecting against malicious attacks at the VM or application level. This occurs because detection and treatment of security breaches depends on different mechanisms. Even when an attack leads to a failure condition, dealing with this issue can propagate {{the consequences of the}} attack <b>to</b> the <b>standby</b> units. For example, {{in the case of a}} Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, the middleware can proactively detect the active unit is out of service, failover <b>to</b> the <b>standby</b> unit, and transfer all requests <b>to</b> the <b>standby</b> unit. This strategy would propagate the denial of service <b>to</b> the <b>standby</b> unit. Therefore, the integration of HA and security services is {{an essential}} requirement when implementing a cloud middleware.|$|R

50|$|As {{users of}} energy and {{government}} authorities have {{become aware of the}} need not to waste energy, more attention is being paid to the electrical efficiency of devices (fraction of power consumed that achieves functionality, rather than waste heat); this affects all aspects of equipment, including standby power. Standby power use can be decreased both by attention to circuit design and by improved technology. Programs directed at consumer electronics have stimulated manufacturers <b>to</b> cut <b>standby</b> power use in many products. It is probably technically feasible <b>to</b> reduce <b>standby</b> power by 75% overall; most savings will be less than a watt, but other cases will be as large as 10 watts.|$|R

5000|$|On {{most modern}} airlines, flying standby {{occurs when a}} {{passenger}} travels on a flight without a prior reservation for that specific flight. There are two circumstances in which passengers typically fly standby. First, a missed flight may require a passenger <b>to</b> fly <b>standby</b> on the next flight to the same destination, as they now lack a reservation. Secondly, a passenger may arrive at the airport early (whether accidentally or on purpose) and wish to take an earlier flight listed for that day.
