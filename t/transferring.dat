5|$|Two {{practices}} {{mentioned in}} the list of meritorious acts have been studied quite extensively by scholars: dedicating (or <b>transferring)</b> merit to others, and rejoicing in others' merits. <b>Transferring</b> merit is a widespread custom in all Buddhist countries, Mahāyāna, Vajrayāna and Theravāda. In the Pāli tradition, the word pattidāna is used, meaning 'giving of the acquired'. And in the Sanskrit tradition, the word pariṇāmanā is used for <b>transferring</b> merit, meaning 'bending round or towards, transfer, dedication'. Of these translations, 'transfer of merit' has become commonplace, though objected to by some scholars.|$|E

5|$|Buddhist traditions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} how this transfer proceeds. <b>Transferring</b> merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word transfer, the merit of the giver {{is in no way}} decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must also be able to sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act of <b>transferring</b> merit will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the <b>transferring</b> of merit to occur. The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, <b>transferring</b> merit is connected to the notion of an intermediate state. The merit that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way of <b>transferring</b> merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the devas (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.|$|E

40|$|<b>Transfer</b> of {{learning}} occurs when learning in one context enhances (positive <b>transfer)</b> or undermines (negative <b>transfer)</b> a related performance in another context. <b>Transfer</b> includes near <b>transfer</b> (to closely related contexts and performances) and far <b>transfer</b> (to rather different contexts and performances). <b>Transfer</b> {{is crucial to}} education, which generally aspires to impact on contexts {{quite different from the}} context {{of learning}}. Research on <b>transfer</b> argues that very often <b>transfer</b> does not occur, especially far" <b>transfer.</b> However, sometimes far <b>transfer</b> does occur. Findings from various sources suggest that <b>transfer</b> happens by way of two rather different mechanisms. Reflexive or low road <b>transfer</b> involves the triggering of well-practiced routines by stimulus conditions similar to those in the learning context. Mindful or high road <b>transfer</b> involves deliberate effortful abstraction and a search for connections.
