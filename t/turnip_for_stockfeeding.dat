50|$|Agriculture in the Atherton Tablelands {{followed}} {{mining and}} grazing. Although timber drew many settlers to the area, the maize industry was pivotal in {{opening up the}} Atherton Tablelands to agriculture. Maize initially fulfilled the requirements <b>for</b> <b>stockfeed</b> <b>for</b> the mining communities around Herberton and Irvinebank and later, further west.Realising {{that it would be}} difficult to prosper only from planting maize crops, the farmers attempted to find alternate crops. The Atherton Farmers' Associated lobbied the Minister for Agriculture to establish a State Farm to provide research and advice on the growing of different strains of maize. As a result, the Kairi State Farm was established in 1912 and was responsible for much of the experimental work carried out within the maize industry. The Kairi State Farm remained in operation until closed by the Queensland Government in 1935 despite the closure being disputed by the farming community which pointed out to the Government the desirability of having such a facility in a tropical environment.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the results from a study which was done to analyse the operation of the demand for and supply of the most important stockfeed proteins (maize, wheat, sorghum, oilseed and fishmeal). A sectoral mathematical model was developed to analyze the economic impact of changes in the market <b>for</b> <b>stockfeed</b> proteins on the South African animal feed market. The model was used to simulate the effects of arbitrarily chosen scenarios on key parameters. Results indicate that models, such as these, are indispensable planning tools in situations of uncertainty. Relatively small changes in important things like production costs, yields and international prices often have profound influences on local production patterns and profitability. It clearly illustrates that in an environment of free domestic trade and increased international trade liberalisation, factors outside of agricultural policy may have much larger impacts than agricultural policy.

40|$|Scarcity of feed of a {{succulent}} nature, for milking cows, {{during the}} fall and early winter, suggested to us the growing of soft <b>turnips</b> <b>for</b> that purpose. Our dry, warm climate is not suited <b>for</b> <b>turnips</b> planted in the spring. They mature early and become rank flavored and unpalatable. European farmers grow them successfully, from spring planting, in. moist, cool climates, where the maize plant will not mature, and where the entire summer season is necessary to develop them. Fairly good success from planting them later, and fairly good results from feeding them to dairy cows, induced us to experiment, {{during the summer of}} 1894, with later planting. Iowa farmers have usually sown turnips broadcast, which prevents cultivation. Drouths that are common with us generally evaporate the moisture from the surface soil, and few turnips are gathered. Our people seldom depend on turnips as part of a fall or winter ration for domestic animals, but the growth of dairying requires succulent feed at all seasons, and the soft <b>turnip</b> is valuable <b>for</b> this purpose between summer and winter conditions...|$|R

40|$|In Galicia (northwestern Spain), Brassica rapa subsp. rapa L. {{includes}} turnip {{greens and}} turnip tops as main crops. Evaluation of B. rapa varieties with wide adaptability across diverse farming environments {{is important for}} selecting varieties for future breeding programs based on producers and consumers preferences. Twelve varieties of this species were evaluated in seven environments {{to determine the best}} performing varieties and to assess their nutritional characteristics. Different agronomical traits related with production, earliness, and adaptation were evaluated and most of them showed significant differences among varieties, years, and locations. To study more deeply the effect of the genotype main effect (G) plus the genotype Ã— environment interaction (GE) on fresh production, the site regression model (SREG) was used. The G+GE interaction explained 46 and 58 % of fresh production <b>for</b> <b>turnip</b> greens and tops, respectively. The GGE biplot technique facilitates a visual evaluation of superior genotypes. The varieties MBG-BRS 0550 and MBG-BRS 0082 were the best genotypes <b>for</b> <b>turnip</b> greens production <b>for</b> almost all environments whereas the most suitable varieties <b>for</b> <b>turnip</b> tops production were MBG-BRS 0472 and MBG-BRS 0143. Varieties differed significantly for crude fiber and acid detergent fiber (ADF) content and they showed higher concentration of the anions Clâˆ’, NO 3 âˆ’, and SO 4 2 â€“ in turnip greens than in turnip tops. Both plant organs showed high contents of Ca, K, Mg, and P. Therefore, B. rapa varieties evaluated proved to be a valuable source of minerals, protein, and fiber.
