The methods were developed for images obtained by confocal <b>tandem</b> <b>scanning</b> reflected light microscope. Quality {{of the images}} is sufficient for semi-automatic analysis. However, the automatic method does not give satisfactory results because it gives mean cell area 30 % bigger and 60 % fewer cells than in the semi-automatic method.

40|$|Real time {{measurements}} of cell-substratum adhesion in endothelial cells {{were obtained by}} <b>tandem</b> <b>scanning</b> confocal microscopy of sites of focal contact (focal adhesions) at the abluminal cell surface. Focal contact sites were sharply defined (low radiance levels) in the living cell such that the images could be enhanced, digitized, and isolated from other cellular detail. Sites of focal contact are the principal determinant of cell-substratum adhesion. Measurements of (a) the focal contact area and (b) the closeness of contact (inverse radiance) were used to nominally define the adhesion of a single cell or field of cells, and to record spontaneous and induced changes of cell adhesion in real time. The topography of focal contacts was estimated by calculating separation distances from radiance values using a calibration technique based on interference ring optics. While slightly closer contact was noted between the cell membrane and substratum {{at or near the}} center of each focal contact, separation distances throughout the adhesion regions were always < 50 nm. Subtraction of consecutive images revealed continuous spontaneous remodeling of individual focal adhesions in unperturbed cells during periods of < 1 min. Despite extensive remodeling of focal contact sites, however, cell adhesion calculated for an entire cell over extended periods varied by < 10 %. When cytoskeletal stability was impaired by exposure to cytochalasin or when cells were exposed to proteolytic enzyme, endothelial adhesion declined rapidly. Such changes were recorded at the level of single cells, groups of cells, and at single focal adhesions. In both unperturbed and manipulated cells, the dynamics of remodeling and cell adhesion characteristics varied greatly between individual sites within the same cell; disappearance of existing sites and appearance of new ones often occurred within minutes while adjacent sites underwent minimal remodelling. <b>Tandem</b> <b>scanning</b> confocal microscopy image analysis of living cells in real time provides repetitive spatial, temporal, and quantitative information about cell adhesion.

40|$|PURPOSE: This report {{describes}} the clinical course, refractive changes, confocal microscopic and histological evaluation of corneal endothelial cell transplantation in rabbits with long-term follow-up. METHODS: Transplantation of corneal endothelial cells using a cell/carrier device {{was performed in}} 19 rabbits. Clinical evaluation between 1 - 25 months included slit-lamp examination, keratometry, retinoscopy and surface topography. Two grafts in rabbits with 12 and 24 month survivals were evaluated in vivo by 3 D <b>tandem</b> <b>scanning</b> confocal microscopy. The same grafts were then processed for transmission electron microscopy. BrdU labeling of the grafted cells in one transplant was performed in order to distinguish between host and grafted endothelial cells. RESULTS: All grafts cleared and remained clear {{for an average of}} one year without signs of rejection or inflammation. Postoperative refraction data and topography of the transplants showed progressive development of myopia and steep corneas compared to the unoperated eyes in each case. Confocal microscopy in vivo demonstrated a regular hexagonal pattern of the transplanted endothelial cells and a thickened Descemet's membrane, which correlated with the light and electron microscopic findings. BrdU labeling of the grafted endothelial cells showed a homogenous labeling of cell nuclei 6 months after the transplantation.

Of the seven eyes, three also had corneal oedema (Fuchs' dystrophy). In vivo white light <b>tandem</b> <b>scanning</b> confocal microscopy {{was performed in}} all eyes. Results were compared with non-contact specular microscopy.  RESULTS—Specular microscopy was precluded by corneal oedema in one eye. In the remaining six eyes, it demonstrated typical changes including pleomorphism, polymegathism, {{and the presence of}} guttae appearing as dark bodies, some with a central bright reflex. In all seven eyes, confocal microscopy revealed the presence of round hyporeflective images with an occasional central highlight {{at the level of the}} endothelium. Changes in cell morphology and size were readily appreciated.  CONCLUSION—By comparison with specular microscopy, the hyporeflective images with an occasional central highlight seen on confocal microscopy are consistent with the presence of guttae. Confocal microscopy may confirm the diagnosis of cornea guttata and Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy by demonstrating the presence of guttae. This technique is especially valuable in cases of corneal oedema, where specular microscopy may fail to visualise the endothelium. However, specular microscopy should remain the method of choice to evaluate the endothelium, principally because it is easier to use.    Keywords: confocal microscopy; cornea guttata; Fuchs' dystroph...|$|R

A more recent study on mice suggested an essential role of corneal dendritic cells in the immune defence against HSV- 1 keratitis, by directing the local NK response [22]. Mayer et al. found more antigen-presenting cells in post-herpes keratitis corneas than in graft rejection after keratoplasty or keratoconus, assessed via confocal microscopy and histochemistry [18]. Mocan et al. found dendritiform and small round cells by in vivo confocal microscopy in 52 % of patients with non-epithelial herpes keratitis. This included eight patients with keratouveitis, which showed DCs in 38 %. In their healthy controls, these authors apparently did not see any DCs [9].

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} ion-abundance threshold settings for data-dependent acquisition on a hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer, analyzing features such as {{the total number of}} spectra collected, the signal to noise ratio of the full MS scans, the spectral quality of the tandem mass spectra acquired, and the number of peptides and proteins identified from a complex mixture. We find that increasing the threshold for data-dependent acquisition generally decreases the quantity but increases the quality of the spectra acquired. This is especially true when the threshold setting is set above the noise level of the full MS scan. We compare two distinct experimental configurations: one where full MS scans are acquired in the Orbitrap analyzer while <b>tandem</b> MS <b>scans</b> are acquired in the LTQ analyzer, and one where both full MS and <b>tandem</b> MS <b>scans</b> are acquired in the LTQ analyzer. We examine the number of spectra, peptides, and proteins identified under various threshold conditions, and we find that the optimal threshold setting is at or below the respective noise level of the instrument regardless of whether the full MS scan is performed in the Orbitrap or in the LTQ analyzer. When comparing the high-throughput identification performance of the two analyzers, we conclude that, used at optimal threshold levels, the LTQ and the Orbitrap identify similar numbers of peptides and proteins. The higher scan speed of the LTQ, which results in more spectra being collected, is roughly compensated by the higher mass accuracy of the Orbitrap, which results in improved database searching and peptide validation software performance...|$|R
40|$|Focal {{adhesion}} {{sites were}} observed in cultured endothelial cells by <b>tandem</b> <b>scanning</b> confocal microscopy and digitized image analysis, techniques that provide real-time images of adhesion site area and topography in living cells. Image subtraction demonstrated that {{in the presence of}} unidirectional steady laminar flow (shear stress [tau] = 10 dyn/cm 2) a substantial fraction of focal adhesion sites remodeled in the direction of flow. In contrast, focal adhesions of control (no flow) cells remodeled without preferred direction. In confluent monolayers subjected to shear stresses of 10 dyn/cm 2, cells began to realign in the direction of flow after 7 - 9 h. This was accompanied by redistribution of intracellular stress fibers, alignment of individual focal adhesion sites, and the coalescence of smaller sites resulting in fewer, but larger, focal adhesions per cell. Cell adhesion, repeatedly calculated in the same cells {{as a function of the}} areas of focal contact and the separation distances between membrane and substratum, varied by < 10 % during both short (30 min), or prolonged (< or = 24 h), periods of exposure to flow. Consistent with these measurements, the gains and losses of focal adhesion area as each site remodeled were approximately equivalent. When the glass substratum was coated with gelatin, rates of remodeling were inhibited by 47 % during flow (tau = 10 dyn/cm 2). These studies: (a) reveal the dynamic nature of focal adhesion; (b) demonstrate that these sites at the ablumenal endothelial membrane are both acutely and chronically responsive to frictional shear stress forces applied to the opposite (lumenal) cell surface; and (c) suggest that components of the focal adhesion complex may be mechanically responsive elements coupled to the cytoskeleton...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the degree of eccentricity between different tungsten carbide bur manufacturing techniques and to study the effect of bur inaccuracy on dental enamel. Error in bur concentricity may arise from malalignment of the steel shaft and carbide head in a two-piece construction bur. Cutting blades rotate at multiple radii from the shaft axis, potentially producing vibrations and damage to the cut substrate. Techniques now allow for the manufacture of one-piece tungsten carbide burs with strength adequate to withstand lateral loading. A comparison of tungsten carbide dental cutting tools revealed the true extent of concentricity errors. Variation in alignment of the cutting head and shaft in the two-part constructions incurred between 20 and 50 pm of additional axial error. High-speed cutting interactions with dental enamel between carbide burs were studied {{by means of a}} video-rate confocal microscope. A cutting stage fitted to a <b>Tandem</b> <b>Scanning</b> Microscope (TSM) allowed for real-time dynamic image acquisition. Images were captured and retrieved by means of a low-light-level camera recording directly to S-VHS videotape. Videotape showing the interactions of high-speed rotary cutting instruments (at 120, 000 rpm) were taken under simulated normal wet-cutting environments, and the consequent damage to the tooth tissue was observed as it occurred. Concentrically engineered bur types produced a superior quality cut surface at the entry, exit, and advancing front aspects of a cavity, as well as less subsurface cracking. Imaging of the coolant water film local to recent cutting operations showed regular spherical cutting debris of 6 to 18 pm diameter from the concentric tools, whereas the less-well-engineered burs produced ragged, irregular chips, with 25 - 40 pm diameter debris, indicating far more aggressive cutting actions.

40|$|Reflected light {{microscopy}} of biological material {{has been a}} very difficult task and many different but hardly successful {{attempts have been made to}} get usable images. The main reasons for this state are: weak reflections from the biologically important structures in the object as against strong reflection at its surface; reflections at optical surfaces in the microscope which cause a deterioration of contrast; and the mixing together of reflections from many levels in the object so that the signal coming from the focussed-on level is lost in noise and d. c. components. We tried, and successfully, to reverse this situation and to make it possible for the signal to overwhelm spurious and scattered light using double, or, as we call it, <b>tandem</b> <b>scanning.</b> The object is illuminated only in small patches lying in one plane and moving across this plane and only the light reflected from these illuminated patches is allowed to pass into the image plane and participate in image formation. The image consists of points which travel over the image plane and which are geometrical images of the illuminated patches in the focussed-on object plane. To ensure that only the light belonging to these geometrical images be allowed to enter the image, the image plane is covered with an opaque diaphragm having holes in locations exactly corresponding to the locations of the geometrical images of the illuminated object points; this diaphragm travels in concordance with the first scanning and so the complete image of the focussed-on object plane is formed successively. Both scans are performed by a single device, a Nip-kow disc carrying in its annular periphery several ten thousands of holes arranged in Archimedean spirals. The disc is 100 mm in diameter and rotates about 100 rpm driven by an electric motor. On one side the disc is illuminated in a circle 18 mm in diameter, and the light transmitted through several hundred holes and reflected in a mirror system passes a microscope objective which forms the images of the disc holes in the object plane. The light reflected here passes through the same objective and mirror system (one mirror being a 'limitlessly thin* beam splitter) to pass conjugate aperture holes on the observation side of the Nipkow disc. As the disc lies at the intermediate image plane of the objective lens on both its illuminating and observation sides, only light emanating from reflection or fluorescence in the plane of focus can contribute to the image. High contrast images of very thin focussed-on layers are thus formed. The practical arrangements are such that very large specimens can be examined: the specimens for this microscope need not themselves be microscopic...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{efforts to}} improve the methodology of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) as a method for analysis of metabolites from plant tissue samples. The first chapter consists of a general introduction to the technique of MALDI-MSI, and the sixth and final chapter provides a brief summary and an outlook on future work. The second chapter (following a general introduction) illustrates how MALDI-MSI of metabolites can be combined with genomics knowledge to infer functional genomic information. Wild-type Arabidopsis flower petals were investigated for their content of three flavonoids (kaempferol, quercetin, and isorhamnetin) and their glucosides, and compared to a well-understood flavonoid mutant (tt 7). Spatially non-uniform accumulation/depletion of flavonoids is observed between the wild-type and mutant, and metabolite abundances are compared to infer information about localized gene expression. The third chapter demonstrates a novel small molecule application for a matrix previously used for MALDI-MSI of lipids (1, 5 -diaminonaphthalene, DAN). DAN was compared to other common MALDI matrices for its efficiency in ionization of several plant metabolite standards, and was found to be comparable or superior for all tested metabolites. DAN was then applied to image a range of classes of metabolites from a cross-section of corn leaf. The fourth chapter presents a novel acquisition method, in which high-mass resolution and <b>tandem</b> MS <b>scans</b> are acquired in alternating polarities during a single MALDI-MSI experiment. This methodology yields highly information-rich datasets, allowing for the generation of images from either high-resolution, accurate mass measurements or specific MS/MS or MSn transitions in both polarities, greatly expanding the number of detectable metabolites. The fifth chapter describes modifications made to the instrument laser optics to significantly enhance the achievable spatial resolution for MALDI-MSI on the system. A combination beam expander/spatial filter and aspheric focusing optics are used to reduce the laser spot size at the sample surface. This high-resolution configuration is then used to image metabolites from a corn leaf cross-section at 5 Âµm resolution, revealing single-cell metabolite localizations within the tissue...|$|R

We found {{that a combination of}} two reverse phases and one cation-exchange phase, was the best tool, giving a total extraction recovery higher than 80 %. The process was completed by a single chromatographic analysis {{of a wide range of}} naturally occurring cytokinins (bases, ribosides, O - and N -glucosides, and nucleotides) in 24. 5 minutes using an analytical column packed with sub- 2 -microne particles. In multiple reaction monitoring mode, the detection limits ranged from 0. 05 to 5 fmol and the linear ranges for most cytokinins were at least five orders of magnitude. The StageTip purification was validated and optimized using samples of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, roots and shoots where eighteen cytokinins were successfully determined.

40|$|AbstractElectrospray {{ionization}} (ESI) tandem {{mass spectrometry}} (MS) has simplified analysis of phospholipid mixtures, and, in negative ion mode, permits structural identification of picomole amounts of phospholipid species. Collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) of phospholipid anions yields negative ion tandem mass spectra that contain fragment ions representing the fatty acid substituents as carboxylate anions. Glycerophosphocholine (GPC) lipids contain a quaternary nitrogen moiety and more readily form cationic adducts than anionic species, and positive ion tandem mass spectra of protonated GPC species contain no abundant ions that identify fatty acid substituents. We report here that lithiated adducts of GPC species are readily formed by adding lithium hydroxide {{to the solution}} in which phospholipid mixtures are infused into the ESI source. CAD of [MLi+] ions of GPC species yields tandem mass spectra that contain prominent ions representing losses of the fatty acid substituents.

40|$|Glycosylinositol phosphorylceramides (GIPCs) are a {{class of}} acidic glycosphingolipids (GSLs) {{expressed}} by fungi, plants, and certain parasitic organisms, but not found in cells or tissues of mammals or other higher animals. Recent characterizations of fungal GIPCs point to an emerging diversity which could rival that already known for mammalian GSLs, and which {{can be expected to}} present a multitude of challenges for the analytical chemist. Previously, the use of Li+ cationization, in conjunction with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and low-energy collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/CID-MS), was found to be particularly effective for detailed structural analysis of monohexosylceramides (cerebrosides) from a variety of sources, including fungi, especially minor components present in mixtures at extremely low abundance. in applying Li+ cationization to characterization of GIPCs, a substantial increase in both sensitivity and fragmentation was observed on collision-induced dissociation of [M + Li](+) versus [M + Na](+) for the same components analyzed under similar conditions, similar to results obtained previously with cerebrosides. Molecular adduct fragmentation patterns were found to be systematic and characteristic for both the glycosylinositol and ceramide moieties with or without phosphate. Interestingly, significant differences were observed in fragmentation patterns when comparing GIPCs having Man alpha 1 [...] > 2 versus Man alpha 1 [...] > 6 Ins core linkages. in addition, it was useful to perform <b>tandem</b> product ion <b>scans</b> on primary fragments generated in the orifice region, equivalent to ESI-(CID-MS) (2) mode. Finally, precursor ion scanning from appropriate glycosylinositol phosphate product ions yielded clean molecular ion profiles in the presence of obscuring impurity peaks. the methods were applied to detailed characterization of GIPC fractions of increasing structural complexity from a variety of fungi, including a non-pathogenic Basidiomycete (mushroom), Agaricus blazei, and pathogenic Euascomycete species such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Sporothrix schenckii. the analysis confirmed a remarkable diversity of GIPC structures synthesized by the dimorphic S. schenckii, as well as differential expression of both glycosylinositol and ceramide structures in the mycelium and yeast forms of this mycopathogen. Mass spectrometry also established that the ceramides of some A. fumigatus GIPC fractions contain very little 2 -hydroxylation of the long-chain fatty-N-acyl moiety, a feature that is not generally observed with fungal GIPCs.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to develop liquid {{chromatography}} tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) methods {{for the analysis of}} different, novel micropollutants in waste water and natural water. Micropollutants are compounds that can exert adverse environmental and human health effects at low concentrations. Most of these compounds include personal care products and pharmaceuticals, such as antibiotics and controlled substances. In {{the first part of this}} study, we focused in the analysis of illicit drugs and drug metabolites because these analyses have the potential to serve as markers of drug abuse. We have detected over sixteen different illicit drugs and their metabolites in wastewater taken from a small school campus in northern Illinois. The most abundant and consistent drugs found in the wastewater were cannabinol, amphetamines and cocaine. The concentrations of these drugs are being monitored at regular time intervals for the purpose of determining the total drug consumption of a targeted population. This type of drug testing (of small, demographically well-defined populations) has the potential to provide a more accurate snapshot of drug use than surveys (which are currently used) that rely on self-reporting. The information about drug consumption acquired through wastewater testing can inform public health initiatives and anti-drug campaigns without being personally invasive. The success of these initiatives can be measured by making wastewater measurements before and after they are undertaken. In the second part of this study, we developed a method that would allow us to determine the identities of unknown or novel chemicals contributing to water pollution. We applied full <b>scan</b> <b>tandem</b> mass spectrometric techniques such as constant neutral loss scan and precursor ion scan to detect novel pollutants in water. We detected over 160 glucuronides metabolites and over 60 chlorinated organic compounds in influents by constant neutral loss scanning method. Then by two different precursor ion scanning methods, we detected over 80 chlorinated organic compounds in influents. In the Lake water samples, we detected about 36 glucuronide metabolites and about 22 chlorinated organic compounds which were analyzed by constant neutral loss and precursor ion scan methods respectively. The identities of these compounds may be inferred through accurate mass analysis of molecule and product ions. Once the identity of a potential pollutant is determined, quantification in water may be done by isotope dilution mass spectrometry. We anticipate many of these micropollutants (derived from pharmaceuticals and personal care products) may exert adverse effects on biota and humans at low concentrations upon continuous exposure from sources such as drinking water...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The wine {{industry}} {{is an important}} sector of agriculture and wine analysis forms the basis of assessing compliance of its commodities with regulatory standards and research in this field. Liquid chromatography (LC) is extensively used for the determination {{of a wide range}} of nonvolatile wine components, but conventional detectors impose performance limitations on the technique that prevents its application to sophisticated analytical problems. In particular, conventional detectors for LC often lack the sensitivity and specificity for the determination of many wine compounds, especially trace level analytes, and furthermore, do not possess spectral capabilities for compound identification or structure elucidation. The hyphenation of mass spectrometry (MS) to LC has led to the introduction of a range of detectors that confers high levels of sensitivity and selectivity to the technique. In addition, a wide variety of MS architectures are available that are inherently suited for targeted analysis or structure elucidation studies. In this dissertation, the potential benefits of liquid chromatography – tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to solve analytical problems relevant to the {{wine industry}} are explored. LC-MS/MS is a particularly versatile analytical technique because both mass analysers can be operated in full-spectrum mode or selected-ion monitoring, which, together with optional fragmentation, gives rise to four modes of operation that may be used for highly specific and sensitive targeted analysis or spectral investigations. In multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, both analysers are set at single ion frequencies specific for the compound under investigation and one or more of its product fragments, respectively. MRM mode is ideally suited for trace level analysis in complex mixtures, even in cases where the target components are not resolved from interferences. In this study, MRM detection was used to solve challenges relevant to the wine industry for the selective quantitation of target analytes that could not be analysed by conventional LC methods. The application of this approach for the analysis of natamycin, ethyl carbamate (EC) and 3 -alkyl- 2 - methoxypyrazines (MPs) in wine is demonstrated. Natamycin is an antimicrobial preservative that is not permitted in wine in the European Union. A rapid and sensitive method for the determination of natamycin was developed, and has been used since 2009 to regulate this vitally important sector of the South African wine export industry. EC is a natural carcinogen that occurs at trace level amounts in alcoholic products. It also has the potential to accumulate in wines and can occur in very high concentrations in some fruit brandies. The determination of EC is complicated by its physicochemical properties, and available analytical methods suffer from drawbacks such as the requirement for elaborate extraction procedures and high solvent consumption. A novel method for the determination of EC in wines, fortified wines and spirits is described and it was applied to perform an audit of the South African industry as well as to investigate factors responsible for its accumulation in alcoholic beverages. This work forms an integral part of the food safety mandate of the State and it ensures that export products comply with international norms for trade. MPs are ultra-trace-level aroma compounds that contribute to the varietal character of Sauvignon blanc wines. Their analytical determination is challenging due to their low levels of occurrence. The loading capacity of LC combined with the sensitivity and resolving power of MS was exploited to analyse concentrated extracts, in order to achieve very low limits of detection. The performance of the LC-MS/MS method enabled the quantitation of these compounds at their natural levels of occurrence, including the first quantitation and spectral confirmation of 3 - ethyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine in wine. Extensive data pertaining to South African Sauvignon blanc wines are reported and statistical analysis is performed, reporting the correlation of variables such as vintage and origin as well as wine parameters such as malic acid with wine MPs. Furthermore, the application of LC-MS/MS for structural elucidation and screening of target classes of analytes was demonstrated for the analysis of red wine anthocyanins. The anthocyanidin-glycosides are responsible for the colour of red grapes and wine, contribute to the sensory properties of wine, and are also of interest due to their beneficial biological properties. Their determination is complicated by their large numbers and structural diversity, further exacerbated by diverse reactions during wine ageing as well as the lack of reference standards for most members of this class of compounds. <b>Tandem</b> MS in <b>scan</b> mode was used for the highly selective detection of glycosylated anthocyanins and derivatives, exploiting the predictable elimination of the sugar moiety in neutral loss mode. Concurrent survey scan experiments were used to unambiguously identify neutral loss detected compounds. The method therefore follows a simplified and structured approach for unambiguous peak identification based on elution order and mass spectral information to impart a high level of certainty in compound identification. In summary, the work presented in this dissertation demonstrates that LC-MS/MS is a versatile and powerful analytical approach for the analysis of diverse compounds of relevance to the wine industry. The sensitivity and specificity of MRM mode, and the selectivity and spectral capabilities of neutral loss and survey scan modes of MS/MS detection, is amply demonstrated by the applications presented in the dissertation. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die wynbedryf is ‘n belangrike komponent van landbou en wyn-analise vorm ‘n integrale deel van gehalteversekering ten opsigte van toepaslike wetlike standaarde. Wyn-analise is ook belangrik in navorsing oor die samestelling van wyn. Vloeistofchromatografie word dikwels aangewend vir die bepaling van ‘n wye verskeidenheid nie-vlugtige wynkomponente, maar konvensionele detektors plaas beperkinge op die aanwending van die tegniek tot gesofistikeerde analitiese toepassings. Meer spesifiek, konvensionele detektors vir vloeistofchromatografie beskik nie oor die sensitiwiteit en selektiwiteit vir die bepaling van baie wynkomponente nie, veral in die geval van spoorvlakanalise, en beskik boonop ook nie oor spektrale vermoëns vir identifikasie van komponente en struktuurbepaling nie. Die koppeling van vloeistofchromatografie met massaspektrometrie het ‘n reeks detektors tot die tegniek toegevoeg wat hoë vlakke van sensitiwiteit en selektiwiteit bied. Verder bied die verskeidenheid van massaspektrometrie-konfigurasies ook instrumente wat inherent geskik is vir geteikende analise of struktuurbepaling, afhangende van die doel van die ondersoek. In hierdie dissertasie word die voordele ondersoek wat verbonde is aan die aanwending van vloeistofchromatografie – tandem kwadrupool massaspektrometrie om relevante analitiese vraagstukke in die wynbedryf op te los. Hiedie tegniek is besonder toepaslik aangesien beide massa-analiseerders in geselekteerde-ioon modus of in volle skandering gebruik kan word. Tesame met opsionele fragmentasie, gee hierdie uitleg aanleiding tot vier funksionaliteite wat vir hoogs sensitiewe geteikende analise of spektrale onledings gebruik kan word. Eerstens word beide massa analiseerders vir enkel-ioon frekwensies opgestel, spesifiek tot die teikenkomponent en een of meer van sy produkfragmente, wat verkry word deur komponentspesifieke fragmentasie. Hierdie modus is by uitstek geskik vir spoorvlakontleding van komplekse monsters, selfs wanneer die teikenkomponente nie chromatografies van die matriks geskei is nie. In hierdie studie is die tegniek aangewend vir die hoogs sensitiewe bepaling van spoorvlak komponente wat nie met konvensionele detektors gemeet kon word nie. Die aanwending van hierdie tegniek word gedemonstreer vir die spoorvlakbepaling van natamycin, etielkarbamaat en 3 -alkiel- 2 -metoksiepierasiene in wyn. Natamycin is ‘n antimikrobiese preserveermiddel wat ontoelaatbaar is in wyn in die Europese Unie. ‘n Vinnige en sensitiewe metode vir die bepaling van natamycin is ontwikkel, en word reeds sedert 2009 aangewend om hierdie uiters belangrike sektor van die Suid-Afrikaanse wyn uitvoerbedryf te reguleer. Etielkarbamaat is ‘n karsinogeen wat natuurlik voorkom in spoorhoeveelhede in alkoholiese produkte. Dit kan ook onder sekere omstandighede akkumuleer in wyn en in hoë konsentrasies voorkom in vrugtebrandewyne. Die bepaling van etielkarbamaat word bemoeilik deur sy chemiese eienskappe, en gevolglik word analitiese metodes gekenmerk deur uitgebreide, arbeidsintensiewe monstervoorbereiding en die gebruik van groot hoeveelhede, meestal giftige, oplosmiddels. ‘n Nuwe metode vir die bepaling van etielkarbamaat in wyn, gefortifiseerde wyn en spiritualië word beskryf en word aangewend om die faktore vir vorming daarvan te ondersoek. Die metode word aangewend om die Suid-Afrikaanse bedryf te ouditeer in terme van die voedselveiligheid mandaat van die Staat, en om te verseker dat uitvoere voldoen aan standaarde vir internasionale handel. Metoksiepierasiene is vlugtige, ultraspoorvlak wynaromakomponente wat verantwoordelik is vir die kenmerkede kultivarkarakter van Sauvignon blanc wyne. Hul analitiese bepaling word bemoeilik deur hulle lae konsentrasies in wyn. Die ladingskapasiteit van vloeistofchromatografie tesame met die sensitiwiteit en selektiwiteit van massaspektrometrie was benut om hoogs gekonsentreerde ekstrakte te ontleed. Baie hoë vlakke van sensitiwiteit word sodoende verkry. Die verrigting van die metode was voldoende om hierdie komponente teen hulle natuurlike konsentrasies te kwantifiseer, insluitende die eerste kwantifisering en spektrale bevestiging van 3 -etiel- 2 -metoksiepierasien. Omvattende data van die vlakke van hierdie komponente in Suid- Afrikaanse Sauvignon blanc wyne word getoon en statistiese ontleding is gedoen om korrelasies tussen veranderlikes soos oorsprong en oesjaar sowel as basiese wyn veranderlikes soos byvoorbeeld appelsuur, met metoksiepierasienvlakke te ondersoek. Verder was die toepassing van vloeistofchromatografie – tandem massaspektrometrie tot struktuurbepaling en skandering vir groepe van komponente gedemonstreer vir die ontleding van rooiwyn antosianiene. Die antosianien-glukosiede is verantwoordelik vir die kleur van rooi druiwe en wyn, dra by tot die sensoriese eienskappe daarvan, en is ook relevant as gevolg van die voordelige biologiese eienskappe daarvan. Die bepaling van hierdie komponente word gekompliseer deur hulle groot getalle en strukturele diversiteit, verder bemoeilik deur die wye verskeidenheid van reaksies wat hulle ondergaan tydens veroudering. Daar is ook ‘n gebrek aan beskikbaarheid van standaarde vir die meeste van die lede van hierdie klas van komponente. Tandem massaspektrometrie was in skanderingsmodus gebruik vir hoogs selektiewe deteksie van die antosianien-glukosiede deur die voorspelbare eliminasie van die suiker komponent in neutrale verliesskandering te benut. Gelyktydige skanderings van die komponente wat met neutraleverliesskandering waargeneem word, is gebruik vir ondubbelsinnige komponent identifikasie. Die metode volg daarom ‘n eenvoudige en gestruktureerde benadering vir piek identifikasie wat gebaseer is op chromatografiese orde, sowel as massaspektrale inligting, om ‘n hoë vlak van sekerheid aan die identifikasie van komponente te verleen. Samevattend, word daar getoon deur die werk wat in hierdie dissertasie uiteengesit is dat vloeistofchromatografie – tandem massaspektrometrie ‘n veelsydige en kragtige tegniek bied vir chemiese analise relevant tot die wynbedryf. Die sensitiwiteit, selektiwiteit en spektrale vermoëns van die tegniek word duidelik deur toepassings in die dissertasie getoon...|$|R
