40|$|Nuclear {{sustainability}} {{is generally}} {{believed to be}} only reachable through the building of many fast breeder reactors. This paper shows that there is another possibility by using existing reactors that are either <b>thermal</b> <b>breeders</b> or {{have at least a}} high conversion ratio and considerably smaller critical masses than fast systems. Earlier it was believed that <b>thermal</b> molten salt <b>breeders</b> could eventually use the thorium / 233 U cycle, which doesn¿t generate minor actinides and is therefore a cleaner fuel cycle. In the meantime, it has become rather clear that CANDU reactors that use heavy water cooling can also be self-breeders. The CANDU reactors could generate themselves 233 U in thorium targets and could become self-sustaining after 12 years. However, additional 233 U could also be generated in LWRs and fast reactors. It is shown that this generation of 233 U will allow a faster large-term nuclear expansion than fast reactors alone. There could actually be a synergy between <b>thermal</b> and fast <b>breeders</b> if the latter are run with Pu/Minor Actinides/Th fuel, which burns the minor actinides and generates sizeable amounts of 233 U. The main problem is still the necessary reprocessing on which India is working and intends to have in 10 years a large scale reprocessing facility available. However, there is at least an existing method for removing the 233 U by the fluoride volatility method and to further use it in CANDUs. For the preparation of the use of 233 U, we should attempt to run thorium subassemblies in CANDUs, LWRs, and fast reactors. Besides breeding 233 U or at least having a high conversion ratio, CANDUs have the further advantage that they don¿t need a pressure vessel and therefore could be built in large numbers faster than LWRs.

However for the sintered product design, the consequence of this transient might not result in the breeder exceeding its maximum operating temperature if a reasonable contact pressure could be established at the interface. To reduce the safety hazards, the tritium concentration build up in the vacuum vessel in conjunction with the purge gas pressure inside the blanket module should he used as a measure for initiating the reactor shutdown for this type of accident.
