500|$|Tabloid {{criticism}} of Islam4UK and Choudary since {{news of the}} proposed march first became public has, generally, been vitriolic, calling him a [...] "hate preacher". In January 2010, appearing on the BBC's The Daily Politics, he was asked by its presenter, Andrew Neil, for his opinions on the banning of Islam4UK, before being asked to comment on his financial status, claiming that it was [...] "relevant to our viewers". [...] Choudary told Neil that his finances were a personal matter, {{and that he was}} [...] "doing something, and I don't want <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>that</b> with you. [...] I'm not on Jobseeker's allowance, {{but at the same time}} I have family allowance, I have very firmly held views which I'm propagating at the same time." [...] Responding to the media's {{criticism of}} him, Choudary said [...] "I do believe that people have been whipped up into an anti-Islam anti-Muslim frenzy." ...|$|E
500|$|Wheeler {{became famous}} in Britain as [...] "the {{embodiment}} of popular archaeology {{through the medium}} of television". In 1952, Wheeler was invited to be a panelist on the new BBC television series, Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?. Based on the American quiz programme What in the World?, the show was hosted by Glyn Daniel and featured three experts in archaeology, anthropology, and natural history being asked to identify artefacts which had been selected from various museums. However, Wheeler is alleged to have prepared for the show by checking beforehand which objects had been temporarily removed from display. The show proved popular with British audiences, and would air for six more years. It brought Wheeler to public attention, resulting in a Television Personality of the Year award for him in 1954. He also appeared in an episode of Buried Treasure, an archaeology show also hosted by Daniel, in which the pair travelled to Denmark to discuss Tollund Man. In 1957, he appeared in a second episode of Buried Treasure, for which he travelled to Pakistan <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>that</b> nation's archaeology, and in 1958 again appeared in an episode, this time on the site of Great Zimbabwe in Southern Rhodesia. In 1959 he presented his own three-part series on The Grandeur That Was Rome, for which he travelled to Hadrian's Wall, Pompeii, and Leptis Magna; the show failed to secure high ratings, and was Wheeler's last major foray into television. Meanwhile, he also made appearances on BBC radio, initially featuring on the John Irving series The Archaeologist, but later presenting his own eight-part series on Roman Britain and also appearing on the series Asian Club, which was aimed primarily at newly arrived migrants from the Indian subcontinent.|$|E

Harper cited that it would be premature <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>that</b> possibility and added that Canada would send high-ranking representatives to opening ceremonies while monitoring the situation in China before the Games.|$|E

MSNBC noted that the series [...] "mostly remains disconnected from the outside world, so the politics and cultural trends of the time are illustrated through people and their lives, not broad, sweeping arguments." [...] Creator Matthew Weiner called the series science fiction in the past, reasoning that just as science fiction uses a future world <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> issues <b>that</b> concern us today, Mad Men uses the past <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> issues <b>that</b> concern us today <b>that</b> we don't <b>discuss</b> openly.|$|R
