5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum <b>that</b> <b>measures</b> approximately one-third of their body length. During {{the initial stages of}} development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the renal {{function}} measured with either 99 mTc-DTPA or 99 mTc-EC dynamic scintigraphies with <b>that</b> <b>measured</b> using 99 mTc-DMSA static scintigraphy. METHODS: the values of relative renal function measured in 111 renal dynamic scintigraphies performed either with 99 mTc-DTPA (55 studies) or with 99 mTc-EC (56 studies) were compared with the relative function measured using 99 mTc-DMSA static scintigraphy performed within a 1 -month period. The comparisons were performed using Wilcoxon signed rank test. The number of 99 mTc-DTPA and 99 mTc-EC studies that presented relative renal function different by more than 5 % from <b>that</b> <b>measured</b> with 99 mTc-DMSA, using chi square test were also compared. RESULTS: the relative renal function measured with 99 mTc-EC is not statistically different from <b>that</b> <b>measured</b> with 99 mTc-DMSA (p = 0. 97). The relative renal function measured with 99 mTc-DTPA was statistically different from <b>that</b> <b>measured</b> using 99 mTc-DMSA, but with a borderline statistical significance (p = 0. 05). The number of studies with relative renal function different by more than 5 % from <b>that</b> <b>measured</b> with 99 mTc-DMSA is higher for the 99 mTc-DTPA scintigraphy (p = 0. 04) than for 99 mTc-EC. CONCLUSION: the relative renal function measured with 99 mTc-EC dynamic scintigraphy is comparable with <b>that</b> <b>measured</b> with 99 mTc-DMSA static scintigraphy, while the relative renal function measured with 99 mTc-DTPA dynamic scintigraphy presents a significant statistical difference from <b>that</b> <b>measured</b> with 99 mTc-DMSA static scintigraphy...|$|R

5|$|The {{state of}} Kerala is {{often viewed as}} the ideal {{progressive}} leader in the women’s rights movement in India among states.

For example, a 1998 study conducted by Bina Agarwal found that while only 13% of all women in India with landowning fathers inherited that land as daughters, 24% of such women {{were able to do}} so in the state of Kerala.

5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index <b>that</b> <b>measures</b> the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies. Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E

Malawi's governance score had improved between 2000 and 2011. Malawi held its most recent elections in May 2014, with challenger Arthur Peter Mutharika defeating incumbent President Joyce Banda.|$|E

5|$|Macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, are an {{effective}} treatment for DPB when taken regularly {{over an extended}} period of time. Clarithromycin or roxithromycin are also commonly used. The successful results of macrolides in DPB and similar lung diseases stems from managing certain symptoms through immunomodulation (adjusting the immune response), which can be achieved by taking the antibiotics in low doses. Treatment consists of daily oral administration of erythromycin for two to three years, an extended period that has been shown to dramatically improve the effects of DPB. This is apparent when an individual undergoing treatment for DPB, among a number of disease-related remission criteria, has a normal neutrophil count detected in BAL fluid, and blood gas (an arterial blood test <b>that</b> <b>measures</b> the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood) readings show that free oxygen in the blood is within the normal range. Allowing a temporary break from erythromycin therapy in these instances has been suggested, to reduce the formation of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa. However, DPB symptoms usually return, and treatment would need to be resumed. Although highly effective, erythromycin may not prove successful in all individuals with the disease, particularly if macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa is present or previously untreated DPB has progressed to the point where respiratory failure is occurring.|$|E
