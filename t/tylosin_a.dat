40|$|Antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus {{strains of}} animal origin were studied for {{transfer}} of resistance to human strains in vitro, with special reference to <b>tylosin,</b> <b>an</b> antibiotic which is used only in animals. Resistance to tylosin in animal and human strains {{was part of a}} constitutive resistance to all macrolide antibiotics. Resistance to tylosin could not be transferred from animal to human strains in vitro. Transfer of other resistances occurred between few strains and at low frequency. Resistance determinants from only seven animal cultures (out of 196 tested) could donate resistance to human strains in mixed cultures. The pattern of metal ion resistance was markedly different in animal and human strains: this supports the conclusion that spontaneous transfer between them is rare in nature...|$|R

[2] later reported, among other conclusions, that microbial degradation was much greater under aerobic (Eh + 350  mV) conditions than under anaerobic conditions as compared to abiotic transformation or sorption. Kolz et al. [34] concluded that both biodegradation and abiotic degradation occur during {{the transformation of}} tylosin.

40|$|Tylosin is {{a widely}} used {{macrolide}} antibiotic for therapeutics and growth promotion in swine, beef cattle, and poultry production. Through various routes such as manure application, emission, inappropriate disposal, etc., tylosin enters the environment. The fate of tylosin in the environment is not yet fully understood. In this study, two photoreaction products of tylosin in water were identified as isotylosin A alcohol (E,Z) and isotylosin A aldol (E,Z). <b>Tylosin</b> <b>A,</b> B, C, D, isotylosin A alcohol, and isotylosin A aldol were purified, and immunological cross-reactivities of these tylosin-related compounds were tested with a specificity of 26 % for tylosin B, 19 % for tylosin C, 106 % for tylosin D, 121 % for isotylosin A alcohol, and 46 % for isotylosin A aldol, compared to 100 % for <b>tylosin</b> <b>A.</b> Competitive direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for tylosin detection in water was compared with a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method by analyzing the same water samples from a study of tylosin dissipation in water.

40|$|<b>Tylosin,</b> <b>a</b> {{macrolide}} antibiotic, was co-produced {{with four}} structurally similar antibiotics in fermentation cultures of Streptomyces fradiae. Macrocin, desmycosin, lactenocin, and relomycin {{were found to}} be components of a common pathway that functions in tylosin biosynthesis. Data obtained by the addition of the purified 14 C-labeled antibiotics to cultures of S. fradiae revealed that macrocin and desmycosin were direct precursors of tylosin, whereas lactenocin was an immediate precursor of both macrocin and desmycosin. Incubation of these cultures with [14 C]tylosin resulted in an equivalent distribution of radioactive label between relomycin and an unidentified component. The kinetics of incorporation of label into the two species were similar, suggesting that both were derived directly from <b>tylosin.</b> <b>A</b> system that supported that methylation of macrocin to tylosin by cell-free extracts of S. fradiae was developed.

30|$|To summarise, both {{antibiotics}} are biodegradable under laboratory {{conditions with}} delayed degradation in field soils.

40|$|Antibiotics {{are mixed}} with the food of bees to fight against diseases. No maximum residue limits have been set for honey. Recommended {{concentrations}} (RCs) have been published by European Union Reference Laboratories for tylosin and streptomycin. The objective of this project was to select and validate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for the screening of tylosin and streptomycin/dihydrostreptomycin residues to be implemented in the French honey control plan. Four ELISA kits for tylosin and five ELISA kits for streptomycin were evaluated. At the end, one kit each was selected and validated for tylosin (TECNA AB 620) and streptomycin (Europroxima). Both ELISA kits for tylosin and streptomycin are specific, robust, fast and easy-to-use tests. The detection capability CC β of <b>tylosin</b> <b>A</b> was {{less than or equal}} to 10 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1) (half the RC). The CC β of desmycosin (the hydrolysed product of <b>tylosin</b> <b>A</b> in acidic conditions) is approximately 200 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1), which is five times the RC for tylosin (20 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)). Thus, this kit is fit for the screening of <b>tylosin</b> <b>A</b> but is unsuitable to detect desmycosin. The detection capability CC β of streptomycin was {{less than or equal to}} 10 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1) (one fourth the RC). The cross-reactivity with dihydrostreptomycin was equal to 136 %.

30|$|Given a (calculated) log Kow of 2.5, the unspecific binding of the {{uncharged}} tylosin molecule {{to organic}} carbon should be moderate [22]. The pKa of tylosin is around 7.7 {{so that in}} manure with a basic pH the substance is present both as the positively charged cation and the uncharged molecule [23]. With decreasing pH, the degree of protonation and the binding to negatively charged matrices such as manure and soil increases [23, 24]. Yet, Loke et al. [23] found that instead of ionic binding sorption of tylosin (precisely <b>tylosin</b> <b>A)</b> in manure is mainly caused by hydrophobic interactions with organic matter. Apparently, sorption can substantially delay degradation of tylosin. In spiked manure, residual tylosin was detected after 8 months of incubation [21]. Similarly, a prolonged half-life for <b>tylosin</b> <b>A</b> of 49  days was determined in a sandy field soil [22] and of 95 and 97  days in a sandy loam and a clay loam, respectively [25]. Hence, despite its biodegradability, tylosin can be persistent in field soils where dissipation may be much slower than under laboratory conditions.|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{utilization of}} various synthetic or natural chemicals, the adverse {{impact of these}} chemicals and their degradates is of a concern due to {{their presence in the}} environment. However, for most currently used synthetic chemicals, the fate of their degradates are yet to be elucidated. General processes and principles of environmental fate were described. These processes, chemical degradation, biodegradation and photodegradation, affect persistence, and other processes, such as binding, plant/animal uptake, volatilization, runoff, leaching, all influence the movement of a chemical and its degradates in the environment. All processes apply to both parent compounds and their following degradates formed in the environment although degradates might not necessarily behave {{in the same way as}} their parent forms.;The fate of two natural monoterpenoid pesticides, thymol and phenethyl propionate, was investigated at a concentration of 10 mug/g in water and in soil under laboratorial conditions, Both thymol and phenethyl propionate degraded rapidly with half-lives of 4 ∼ 16 days. 2 -Phenylethanol and 2 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) ethanol were detected as primary degradation products of phenethyl propionate. Over time, a considerable volatilization loss of thymol, but not phenethyl propionate, was found in the one-month study under the experimental conditions. The average radioactivity of bound residues remained below 6 %, and mineralization was less than 3 % during the whole experimental period.;The aerobic degradation and photolysis of tylosin was conducted in water and in soil. <b>Tylosin</b> <b>A</b> is degraded with a half-life of 200 d in the light in water, and the total loss of <b>tylosin</b> <b>A</b> in the dark is 6 % of the initial spiked amount during the experimental period. Tylosin C and D are relatively stable except in ultrapure water in the light. Slight increases of tylosin B after two months and formation of two photoreaction isomers of <b>tylosin</b> <b>A</b> were observed under exposure to light. However, tylosin would probably degrade faster if the experimental containers did not prevent UV transmission. In soil <b>tylosin</b> <b>A</b> has a dissipation half-life of 7 d, and tylosin D is slightly more stable, with a dissipation half-life of 8 d in unsterilized and sterilized soil. Sorption and abiotic degradation are the major factors influencing the loss of tylosin in the environment, and no biotic degradation was observed at the test concentration either in pond water or in an agronomic soil, as determined by comparing dissipation profiles in sterilized and unsterilized conditions.;Two photo-reaction products in water were identified as isotylosin A alcohol (E,Z) and isotylosin A aldol (E,Z). The cross-reactivity of these tylosin-related compounds was tested with a specificity of 26 % for tylosin B, 19 % for tylosin C, 106 % for tylosin D, 121 % for isotylosin A alcohol and 46 % for isotylosin A aldol compared to 100 % for <b>tylosin</b> <b>A.</b> Competitive direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for tylosin detection in water was compared with a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method by measuring the same water samples of tylosin from a water dissipation study. ELISA kits detect the other tylosin-related compounds besides <b>tylosin</b> <b>A,</b> which results in difference of tylosin determination in water.;In order to assess the mobility of tylosin in soil, a soil column leaching study and a simple batch sorption experiment were conducted. Tylosin has strong sorption to various soil with sorption distribution coefficients ranging from 42 to 65 ml/g. Leachability is dependent on soil properties and manure amendment with the range of concentration in leachate detected from 0 ∼ 0. 27 ppb after 4 rainfall events in one month leaching column study. The majority of tylosin was not recovered in the testing system, indicating that tylosin mostly was likely mineralized, or irreversibly bound to solid particles since no major degradation products were detected...|$|E
30|$|<b>As</b> <b>tylosin</b> {{tartrate}} {{is sufficiently}} water soluble, test solutions {{were obtained by}} diluting defined volumes of stock solutions with deionised water.

30|$|Some {{of organic}} {{materials}} such as antibiotics are hazardous contaminants in the aquatic environment because of their adverse effects on aquatic life, environment, and humans. In this work, a batch reactor of ultraviolet (UV) light and peroxydisulfate were studied for the degradation of <b>tylosin</b> as <b>a</b> model antibiotic in water. The effect of different parameters such as UV irradiation, peroxydisulfate concentration, antibiotic concentration, and pH on removal of tylosin was investigated carefully. No significant destruction was observed using separate UV illumination.

40|$|<b>Tylosin</b> is <b>an</b> {{antibiotic}} {{commonly used}} in swine industry at subtherapeutic levels to improve growth rates and efficiency of feed utilization. When manure is applied to subsurface drained agricultural fields, antibiotic residues in manure provide selective pressure {{for the development of}} microbial resistance. Transport of these microorganisms through soils into tile drainage lines and ultimately into surface waters is a serious threat for public health. This study was performed to investigate the occurrence and transport of tylosin-resistant enterococci from tile drained agricultural fields receiving semi-annual swine waste applications. The field study was conducted at the Iowa State University Northeast research farm at Nashua, Iowa in April and November of 2009. Liquid swine slurry from <b>an</b> operation feeding <b>tylosin</b> at subtherapeutic levels was injected into no-till field plots. Samples collected from field were assayed for total enterococci concentration and enterococci exhibiting resistance to <b>tylosin</b> at <b>an</b> MIC of 35 mg/L. All the enterococci in manure samples were found to be resistant to tylosin. Concentrations of total and tylosin resistant enterococci in soil samples was 6. 84 x 105 cfu/ 100 ml and 5. 25 x 105 cfu/ 100 ml, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the total and tylosin-resistant enterococci concentrations in water samples (p= 0. 05). Total enterococci concentrations in water samples ranged from 1. 3 x 101 to 5. 0 x 103 cfu/ 100 mL while tylosin resistant enterococci concentrations ranged from 1. 3 x 101 to 1. 2 x 103 cfu/ 100 mL. The percent of tylosin resistant enterococci were highest in manure samples and lowest in drainage water samples, suggesting that enterococci lose resistance as selective pressure from antimicrobial residues decrease...|$|R
