5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} evidence to show that women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work that women have <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Because</b> of the lack of care workers available, the very young and the very old have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E
5|$|Each summer (June, July, and August in the US), the {{producers}} would outline the storylines for the subsequent season. Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign. Unlike other storylines, {{the idea for}} a relationship between Joey and Rachel was decided on halfway through the eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey's romantic interest in Rachel. The storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season's finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to Rachel's baby, as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none. Crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they decided <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>because</b> they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season. Kauffman and Crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even if all the cast members had wanted to continue.|$|E

25|$|Many wounded {{soldiers}} {{were sent to}} the Corporation hospital at Bagthorpe and the necessity arose for some sort of service to be provided. The production of motorbuses by the Daimler Company had ceased as far as the order placed with them in 1915 was concerned, so an approach was made to Barton Brothers of Beeston to see if they would provide a service. This they declined <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>because</b> of the labour shortage, and there the matter rested.|$|E
25|$|Le Rochelais Le Vacher, {{also known}} as M. Lavacher, Lacase or La Case, was single-handedly {{responsible}} for the conciliation between the Antanosy and the French. La Case, Champmargou's subordinate, having married {{the daughter of a}} roandriana and became a local ruler. After successfully fighting in wars against both the Mahafaly and the Karembola (Antandroy), he organized an army of Antanosy soldiers who saved Campmargou and his troops in a revenge attack they were trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>because</b> of the death of one of the Catholic priests who had insulted Dian Manana, a powerful local roandria. Many of the French died from malaria, including Chamargou.|$|E
25|$|Robots have {{replaced}} humans in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans {{prefer not to}} do, or are unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>because</b> of size limitations, or which take place in extreme environments such as outer space or {{the bottom of the}} sea. There are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions. The use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns. The possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future.|$|E

Wesley and Emma then argue over {{who is going to}} go add water to the artichokes that are boiling on the stove. Wesley doesn’t want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it <b>because</b> he is making the door and Emma doesn’t want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it <b>because</b> she is remaking her posters. Wesley says that Emma doesn’t want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it just <b>because</b> she’s “on the rag”, so she throws down her markers and gets up to add the water.|$|R

25|$|Space {{neuroscience}} is {{the scientific}} study of the central nervous system (CNS) functions during spaceflight. Living systems can integrate the inputs from the senses to navigate in their environment and to coordinate posture, locomotion, and eye movements. Gravity has a fundamental role in controlling these functions. In weightlessness during spaceflight, integrating the sensory inputs and coordinating motor responses is harder <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>because</b> gravity is no longer sensed during free-fall. For example, the otolith organs of the vestibular system no longer signal head tilt relative to gravity when standing. However, they can still sense head translation during body motion. Ambiguities and changes in how the gravitational input is processed can lead to potential errors in perception, which affects spatial orientation and mental representation. Dysfunctions of the vestibular system are common during and immediately after spaceflight, such as space motion sickness in orbit and balance disorders after return to Earth.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to making}} his Lancashire debut on 17 June 1950, his 20th birthday, Statham had {{received}} no formal coaching. Early {{on in his}} career with the club, he became known as George because when he arrived {{it was the first time}} in years that there was no one player called George. In his first year, 1950, Statham had relatively little bowling <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>because</b> the under-prepared pitches at Old Trafford were so favourable to spinners Roy Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton. Nonetheless, two fine performances against Somerset and Yorkshire and several valuable early wickets in other innings gave him an excellent average even though he only took 36 wickets in the County Championship, which Lancashire shared with Surrey that season. This placed him top of the average amongst bowlers of pace, but at the time he was seen as only a promising newcomer who might strengthen a department in which England had been deplorably weak ever since the resumption of first-class cricket after the Second World War. However, when England were depleted by injuries in Australia, Statham and off-spinner Tattersall were surprisingly called into the team despite no previous representative experience. Though Statham did not achieve anything of note in his initial Test, by the time the 1951 season began he had made a meteoric rise.|$|E
25|$|Shaw and Edwards (aged 18 and 17, respectively, at {{the time}} Alpha started) were skilled amateur magicians who managed to fool the {{researchers}} with fairly simple tricks during the first stages of investigations. The project had originally started with spoon bending, so the two quickly developed a way to accomplish this. Contrary {{to one of the}} caveats Randi noted in his letter, the test setup included not one, but many and all sorts of spoons on the table, labeled with paper on a loop of string instead of some permanent marking. When starting to bend a spoon, they would actually pick up two or more and remove the labels, which they were allowed <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>because</b> they claimed they were in the way. They would then simply switch the labels when putting them back and wait. The spoons were measured before and after the experiment, and since all sorts of spoons were used, simply switching the labels would produce different measurements, causing the scientist to believe that something paranormal had occurred. In other cases, they would drop one of the spoons in their lap and bend it below the table with one hand, while pretending to bend a spoon in their other hand, distracting the scientists.|$|E
