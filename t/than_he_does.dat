5|$|Donnchadh {{was the son}} of Gille-Brighde, son of Fergus, king of the Gall-Gaidhil. Donnchadh's ancestry {{cannot be}} traced further; no patronymic is known for Fergus from {{contemporary}} sources, and when Fergus' successors enumerate their ancestors in documents, they never go earlier <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> The name Gille-Brighde, used by Donnchadh's father (Fergus' son), was also {{the name of the father}} of Somhairle, petty king of Argyll in the third quarter of the 12th century. As the original territory of the Gall-Gaidhil kingdom probably adjoined or included Argyll, Alex Woolf has suggested that Fergus and Somhairle were brothers or cousins.|$|E
25|$|Socrates, {{attempting}} to flatter Phaedrus, responds {{that he is}} in ecstasy and that it is all Phaedrus' doing. Socrates comments that as the speech seemed to make Phaedrus radiant, he is sure that Phaedrus understands these things better <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> himself, and that he cannot help follow Phaedrus' lead into his Bacchic frenzy. Phaedrus picks up on Socrates' subtle sarcasm and asks Socrates not to joke.|$|E

During this time she embarks on a stormy {{relationship}} with Beppe di Marco (Michael Greco), but she takes things more seriously <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> After he finishes the relationship, a heartbroken Sam looks for comfort elsewhere. She turns to local club owner Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), but he is only using her to make Melanie Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite) jealous, so a hurt Sam decides to leave Walford once again in 2000.|$|E

25|$|The major {{sticking}} point {{for many in}} the question of human evolution was whether human mental faculties could have possibly been evolved. The gap between humans and even the smartest ape seemed too large, even for those who were sympathetic to Darwin's basic theory. Alfred Russel Wallace, the co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection, believed that the human mind was too complex to have evolved gradually, and began over time to subscribe to a theory of evolution that took more from spiritualism than it did the natural world. Darwin was deeply distressed by Wallace's change of heart, and much of the Descent of Man is in response to opinions put forth by Wallace. Darwin focuses less {{on the question of whether}} humans evolved <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> on showing that each of the human faculties considered to be so far beyond those of beasts—such as moral reasoning, sympathy for others, beauty, and music—can be seen in kind (if not degree) in other animal species (usually apes and dogs).|$|E
25|$|On many occasions, Doom’s {{only real}} {{weakness}} {{has been his}} arrogance. Layla Miller once reflected that Doom is incapable of accepting that he himself might be {{the reason for his}} failures. This is most keenly reflected in Doom’s continued refusal to accept responsibility for the accident that fully scarred his face, instead preferring to blame Reed Richards for sabotaging his experiment. While his high opinion of himself is generally accurate, he is generally unable to accept when others may {{have a better understanding of}} a situation <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> – with the occasional exception of hearing the recommendations of heroes such as Mister Fantastic or the Thing when it is to his advantage. Even when teaming up with others against a greater threat, Doom will often try to subvert the alliance for personal gain. For instance, while allied with Adam Warlock and other heroes against the Titan Thanos, he attempted to steal Thanos’ Infinity Gauntlet before its owner had been defeated.|$|E
25|$|The Prince crawls {{into bed}} and appears to sleep. However, he begins writhing as he dreams of the troupe of swans {{emerging}} from under and behind, dancing around him. He wakes from his nightmare, checking under his bed and around his room for swans. His tortured expression and jerky movements convey the Prince in turmoil. His lead Swan then slowly emerges from within the Prince's bed. The Swan dances with the Prince and assures him of his continued affection. But, {{the rest of the}} swans turn on the lead Swan when he makes it clear that he values his relationship with the Prince more <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> them. They separate the two and begin attacking the Prince before the Swan leaps in to save him. The Swan embraces the Prince and envelops him in his wings. The swans' fury increases and their next attack dismembers the Swan, who then disappears. Heartbroken and despondent, the Prince wails and collapses onto the bed. The Queen then finds her dead son's body and breaks down in sobs. However, in death the Prince and the Swan are reunited; as shown by a tableau depicting the lead Swan tenderly holding the young Prince in his arms.|$|E

25|$|During {{a search}} among Mrs McGinty's possessions, Poirot finds a {{newspaper}} from which an {{article has been}} cut out. The newspaper is dated {{a few days before}} the murder. He later discovers that the missing article is about women connected with famous murder cases, and includes photographs of them. He also discovers that Mrs McGinty had purchased a bottle of ink in a local shop shortly before her murder. He concludes that she had recognised one of the women in the article, and had written to the paper in question. Someone must have found out about it and then killed her to prevent her from talking. Poirot and Spence, using the ages of people in the town, conclude that someone is either Lily Gamboll, who committed murder with a meat cleaver as a child, or Eva Kane, who had been the love interest who inspired a man to murder his wife and bury her in a cellar. Another possibility is that someone is Evelyn Hope, the daughter of Eva Kane. Shortly afterwards, Poirot discovers the murder weapon, a sugar hammer, left around in plain sight at his boarding house and accessible to all the suspects. In an attempt to flush out the murderer, Poirot claims to know more <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> and is nearly pushed under an oncoming train. Poirot decides to show most of the suspects the photos at a party. Mrs Upward claims to have seen the photo of Lily Gamboll, but does not say where.|$|E
25|$|Freddy Krueger's {{physical}} appearance has remained largely consistent throughout the film series, although minor {{changes were made}} in subsequent films. He wears a striped red-and-green sweater (solid red sleeves in the original film), a dark brown fedora, his bladed glove, loose black trousers (brown in the original film), and worn work boots, {{in keeping with his}} blue collar background. His skin is scarred and burned as a result of being burned alive by the parents of Springwood, and he has no hair at all on his head as it presumably all burned off. In the original film, only Freddy's face was burned, while the scars have spread to the rest of his body from the second film onwards. His blood is occasionally a dark, oily color, or greenish in hue when he is in the Dreamworld. In the original film, Freddy remains in the shadows and under lower light much longer <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> in the later pictures. In the second film, there are some scenes where Freddy is shown without his bladed glove, and instead with the blades protruding from the tips of his fingers. As the films began to emphasize the comedic, wise-cracking aspect of the character, he began to don various costumes and take on other forms, such as dressing as a waiter or wearing a Superman inspired version of his sweater with a cape (The Dream Child), appearing as a video game sprite (Freddy's Dead), a giant snake-like creature (Dream Warriors), and a hookah smoking caterpillar (Freddy vs. Jason).|$|E
500|$|Glen Boyd of Blogcritics {{said that}} the album has [...] "Deep-ass bass lines, old-school funk samples, and plenty of street smart ghetto {{attitude}} are what powers this record." [...] Jerry Heller wrote that Eazy raps more up front on the album <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> on Straight Outta Compton, and insists that the album's lyrics contain more sexual humor than gangsta vibe.|$|E

500|$|... Zodiac has {{a rating}} of 89% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 233 reviews dubbing it [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] with an average rating of 7.7/10. Its {{consensus}} states [...] "A quiet, dialogue-driven thriller that delivers with scene after scene of gut-wrenching anxiety. David Fincher also spends more time illustrating nuances of his characters and recreating {{the mood of the}} 70s <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> on gory details of murder." [...] It also has a 78 metascore at Metacritic.|$|E
500|$|Mark Gatiss wrote [...] "The Hounds of Baskerville", which {{investigates the}} strange {{activities}} {{at a military}} base. Aware that The Hound of the Baskervilles, first published in 1902, {{was one of the}} most famous of Conan Doyle's original stories, Gatiss felt a greater responsibility to include familiar elements of the story <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> when adapting the lesser-known stories. Russell Tovey appeared as Henry Knight, a man whose father was ripped apart by a gigantic hound on Dartmoor 20 years earlier. Directed by McGuigan, the episode was first broadcast on 8 January 2012.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, at the 30 Rock studios, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), {{is shocked}} when NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) gets more laughs <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> in the elevator, {{compelling}} {{him to go}} to Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) for help. The same thing happens to Jenna and in retaliation, she starts singing [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings", prompting Kenneth to start singing [...] "99 Bottles of Beer", to which everyone in the elevator joins in. As revenge for upstaging them, Tracy and Jenna start doing his page duties which confuses Kenneth. After Tracy explains what Kenneth was doing, Kenneth feels terrible about it and swears never to upstage them again.|$|E

500|$|Feller again led {{the majors}} in wins (25), strikeouts (260), innings pitched (343), and walks (194) for the 1941 season. His six shutouts were an AL-best on the season. That year, Joe DiMaggio talked about Feller's {{pitching}} ability, stating [...] "I don't think anyone {{is ever going}} to throw a ball faster <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> And his curveball isn't human." [...] Feller appeared in the May 12, 1941, edition of Life, which said: [...] "...he is unquestionably the idol of several generations of Americans, ranging in age from 7 to 70. They represent of city, town, and village in the land, speak of him familiarly as 'Bob', and talk about him by the hour, with enthusiasm." ...|$|E
500|$|Imelda Staunton's {{performance}} as Dolores Umbridge and Helena Bonham Carter's as Bellatrix Lestrange were widely acclaimed; Staunton {{was described as}} the [...] "perfect choice for the part" [...] and [...] "one of the film's greatest pleasures", [...] "coming close to stealing the show". The Daily Mail described Staunton's portrayal of Umbridge as a [...] "refreshing addition", with the character herself described as [...] "a cross between Margaret Thatcher and Hyacinth Bucket". Bonham Carter {{was said to be}} a [...] "shining but underused talent". Variety praised Alan Rickman's portrayal of Severus Snape, writing that he [...] "may have outdone himself; seldom has an actor done more with less <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> here". Newcomer Evanna Lynch, playing Luna Lovegood, also received good word from a number of reviewers including the New York Times who declared her [...] "spellbinding".|$|E
500|$|The Guardian Lawrence Norfolk {{commented that}} Sarah is a [...] "far from perfect heroine: a semi-neglectful mother and unfaithful wife", but noted that [...] "Cleave does not mock Sarah (and life in Kingston upon Thames) any more <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> Little Bee and her {{experiences}} in Nigeria." [...] Norfolk felt that: [...] "For all the characters' faults, {{none of them}} is presented as inauthentic or standing for something that we are intended to disbelieve. On the disparity in sympathy for Sarah and Little Bee, Cleave assessed: [...] "Sarah inevitably suffers by proximity to Little Bee, who {{is much easier to}} like. If Sarah is more twisted, I think it's because her path through life has necessarily been more convoluted. Little Bee's life is extremely harrowing but it is also very simple – she is swimming very hard against the current, struggling to survive and not to be swept away. Sarah doesn’t have the luxury of knowing in which direction she should swim." ...|$|E

500|$|When Link {{enters the}} Twilight Realm, the void that corrupts parts of Hyrule, he {{transforms}} into a wolf. He is eventually able to transform between his Hylian and wolf forms at will. As a wolf, Link loses {{the ability to}} use his sword, shield, or any secondary items; he instead attacks by biting and defends primarily by dodging attacks. However, [...] "Wolf Link" [...] gains several key advantages in return—he moves faster <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> as a human (though riding Epona is still faster) and digs holes to create new passages and uncover buried items, and has improved senses, including the ability to follow scent trails. He also carries Midna, a small imp-like creature who gives him hints, uses an energy field to attack enemies, helps him jump long distances, and eventually allows him to [...] "warp" [...] to any of several preset locations throughout the overworld. Using Link's wolf senses, the player can see and listen to the wandering spirits of those affected by the Twilight, as well as hunt for enemy ghosts named Poes.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{his short}} stature, Messi {{has a lower}} centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, {{allowing}} him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica ("The Atomic Flea"). Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting. His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed. His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, [...] "Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> without it." [...] Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses {{the inside of his}} foot to finish and provide passes and assists.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The New York Times, Hal Erickson {{praised the}} film for mixing its [...] "more {{frightening}} aspects" [...] with [...] "slapstick comedy and awesome special effects."

Remarking that Thompson [...] "completely eradicates" [...] the Disney {{interpretation of the}} folktale, he praised her directorial debut, noting the influence of Tim Burton but claiming that she offers [...] "a more universal sweetness" [...] <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> He notes that while remaining accessible to children, the film still [...] "drinks more deeply of the story's dark elements". David Parkinson of Radio Times awarded Snow White two stars out of five, praising Miranda Richardson's performance and comparing it to that of Sigourney Weaver in [...] He also acclaimed the casting of Vincent Schiavelli as the tall dwarf, but in contrast, he criticised Kristin Kreuk's [...] "inanimate performance", seeing her as a [...] "dull heroine." [...] M.S. Mason of the Christian Science Monitor said: [...] "Beautiful young Kristin Kreuk makes a lovely Snow White" [...] although felt that the film was only [...] "passable family fare".|$|E
