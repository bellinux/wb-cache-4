5|$|After {{the first}} two {{large-scale}} battles between the Spanish and Pipil armies resulted in decisive victories for the European invaders, the natives preferred to flee their settlements at their approach rather <b>than</b> <b>face</b> the conquistadors on an open battlefield. A common tactic of the natives was to concentrate themselves in strongly-defended mountaintop fortresses.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October 1797 Brock {{purchased}} {{the rank of}} lieutenant-colonel, and became acting commanding officer of the regiment, assuming substantive command on 22 March 1798 with the retirement of Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Keppel. The rank was apparently bought cheaply; his predecessor from whom he {{purchased the}} rank was advised to sell up and leave the army rather <b>than</b> <b>face</b> a court martial and probable dismissal.|$|E
5|$|A Warrior Who Fought Custer was {{published}} in April 1931 to mostly good reviews. However, W. J. Ghent, writing in the New York Times, criticized the claim made by Wooden Leg that many of Custer's men had committed suicide rather <b>than</b> <b>face</b> death {{at the hands of}} the Indians. Although sales of the Wooden Leg book did well, better than Marquis had expected, this controversy was to prove a hindrance to his chances of future book publications. Marquis believed he had multiple Indian sources verifying this account, and there were no surviving whites to contradict it. He planned to develop the idea more fully in a future book, eventually to become Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself.|$|E

5|$|Donkey Kong's kidnapped friends become playable {{characters}} {{after the}} player rescues them. Each {{of the five}} characters begin with basic abilities and receive additional, unique abilities as the game progresses, including abilities needed to solve some puzzles. For example, Donkey Kong can smash dirt for banana coins, Chunky Kong can lift rocks, Tiny Kong can crawl through holes, Diddy Kong can fly, and Lanky Kong can float. The characters are also unique in the projectiles they shoot and the musical instruments they play. For example, some doors can only be opened with Donkey Kong's coconut projectiles and others can only be opened with Diddy Kong's guitar. There are more special abilities <b>than</b> <b>face</b> buttons on the controller, so button combinations are needed to trigger some abilities.|$|E
5|$|On October 4, 2013, Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler {{approved}} a second petition to recall Colorado State Senator Evie Hudak, also {{an advocate of}} gun control; the signature gatherers had 60 days to collect 18,300 or more signatures to force a recall election in Colorado Senate District 19 which encompasses Arvada, Colorado and Westminster, Colorado. Hudak later resigned rather <b>than</b> <b>face</b> recall. Because she resigned, the Democrats were able to appoint a replacement; {{if she had been}} recalled, the Republicans could have gained a majority in the state senate.|$|E
5|$|Portsmouth was {{affected}} by the British Empire's decline {{in the latter half}} of the 20th century. Shipbuilding jobs fell from 46% of workforce in 1951 to 14% in 1966, drastically reducing the manpower in the dockyard. The city council attempted to create new work; an industrial estate was built in Fratton in 1948, and others were built at Paulsgrove and Farlington in the 1950s and 1960s, respectively. Traditional industries such as brewing and corset making disappeared during this time, though electrical engineering became a major employer. Despite the cutbacks made to traditional sectors, Portsmouth still remained an attractive place for industry. In 1968, Zurich Insurance Group moved their UK headquarters to the city, with IBM relocating their European headquarters in 1979. The population of the city had dropped from approximately 200,000 to 177,142 by the end of the 1960s. In the early 1980s, then Defence Secretary John Nott concluded that of the four home dockyards, both Portsmouth and Chatham would be closed. However, Portsmouth City Council won a concession, and rather <b>than</b> <b>face</b> closure, the dockyard was downgraded to a naval base.|$|E

5|$|The Bodyline {{controversy}} {{continued into}} the 1933 season. Bodyline tactics were used in several matches, including by the West Indian tourists in the second Test. In all first-class cricket, Hammond, no longer vice-captain of Gloucestershire, scored 3,323 runs, passing 3,000 in a season for the first time. With an average of 67.81, he topped the first-class tables for {{what would be the}} first of eight successive seasons. He also took 38 wickets. However, his highest score in three Test innings was 34. In the second Test, unsettled by Bodyline, Hammond was cut on the chin by a short ball, causing him to retire hurt. He again commented that he would quit rather <b>than</b> <b>face</b> such bowling; soon after his return, he was out. Les Ames, who played in the three-match series, won by England 2–0, believed that the West Indian pacemen worried Hammond, who showed a weakness against short, fast bowling.|$|E

25|$|In {{keeping with}} Brooks' own tradition, each ticket sold {{for the tour}} is the same price, {{regardless}} of location in the venue. An issue that arose beginning with the first concerts on the tour has been high ticket resale prices. For example, tickets for the seven-show residency in Dallas were being resold online for an average price 21% higher <b>than</b> <b>face</b> value. Because of Ticketmaster's anti-resale policies, Brooks chose the company to be the official ticket sales company for the tour. Despite the optimism {{for a lack of}} extreme resale prices, Ticketmaster's partner resale sites and services began allowing individuals to sell marked up tickets anyway. In the first weeks of the tour, Atlanta tickets were posted for sale on TicketsNow for as much as nearly 470% higher <b>than</b> <b>face</b> value (i.e. a $71.50 ticket being sold for $405). Brooks, a long-time proponent of banning increased price ticket resales, called out those marking up ticket prices, saying his ultimate goal is making concerts affordable regardless of seat location.|$|E

Esarhaddon defeated them near Hubushna (Hupisna), and they also met defeat at the hands of his successor Ashurbanipal.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes, rather <b>than</b> <b>face</b> {{annihilation}} at {{the hands}} of a pursuing victorious army, a rearguard will be tasked by the commander of the defeated army with hindering the advance of the victorious army.
