500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. And I guess that is a strange way <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> a song you wrote, so yeah, I am happy to not have to do it these days".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Deccan Herald, Anand talked about how the American sitcom Friends influenced the film's two characters revealing he wanted viewers to respond to Akash and Kiara in a similar way. He said: [...] "I remember when I watched Friends I wanted to meet and know every character. That's how I want audiences <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> Ranbir and Priyanka." [...] He also wanted the two to resonate with the audience the way the characters in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) did. In another interview discussing the film, Anand revealed that he wanted to make it different from his earlier films, aiming for it to be a [...] "subdued romance," [...] which is not sexy. He said: [...] "Everyone is going to be covered up in scarf's and mufflers and over coats and boots. This is a rare instance that you’ll see Indian actors dressed full up without skin show."(sic) In September 2009, it was announced that Sajid Nadiadwala would produce the film as he was highly impressed by the script.|$|E

He elaborates, citing the {{conception}} of the Pokémon series as an example, [...] "And that's the point – Not to make something sell, something very popular, but to love something, and make something that we creators can love. It's the very core feeling we should have in making games." [...] Miyamoto wants players to experience kyokan; he wants [...] "the players <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> the game what the developers felt themselves." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stone took on {{the role}} of a {{clinically}} depressed woman in the independent drama When a Man Falls in the Forest (2007), premiered in competition at the 2007 Berlin Film Festival where it was nominated for the Golden Bear. She found her part [...] "challenging" [...] to play, remarking: [...] "It was a watershed experience. I think {{that we live in a}} [...] Prozac society where we're always told we're supposed to have this kind of equilibrium of emotion. We have all these assignments about how we're supposed <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> something." [...] Her next film roles have been in independent productions, including the late 2000s films If I Had Known I Was a Genius (2007), The Year of Getting to Know Us (2008), Five Dollars a Day (2009) and Streets of Blood (2009), all of which went directly-to-DVD in North America.|$|E
2500|$|... "Stay" [...] is a pop ballad that {{consists}} of piano and guitar instrumentation. It is written in the key of A minor, having the chord progression of C-Dm-Am-F. The song has a moderate tempo of 112 beats per minute. Rihanna's vocal range in the song ranges from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. Greg Kot for the Chicago Tribune described the song as being [...] "stripped-bare". The lyrics revolve around [...] "failing to resist true love", according to Dan Martin for NME, as Rihanna sings [...] "Funny, you're the broken one/ But I'm {{the only one who}} needed saving." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena for MTV, Rihanna [...] "punctuates the emotions of the track" [...] on the lyric [...] "It's not much of a life you're living/ It's not just something you take [...] given." [...] Rihanna also makes a plea to her lover, singing [...] "'Round and around and around and around we go/ Now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know/ Not really sure how <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> it/ Something in the way you move/ Makes me feel like I can't live without you/ it takes me all the way/ I want you to stay." [...] Lewis Corner for Digital Spy wrote that Rihanna's vocals glow over the simple yet effective piano riffs.|$|E
