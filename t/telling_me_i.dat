It took five hours to inscribe onto Rhodes' leg. Rhodes {{said he had}} the tattoo done because [...] "I had a few knock-backs when I was younger, when people were <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> was too small, but I’ve always been determined to prove them wrong and I just feel this quotation is appropriate {{for me and my}} life." ...|$|E

I want to succeed at this event, and I want to succeed representing Canada." ...|$|E
500|$|Steinman rejoined Meat Loaf and {{the band}} for a live {{performance}} in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1978 {{with the intention of}} going through the songs for Bat II after the show. However, someone broke into their dressing rooms during the show and stole several possessions, including the new lyric book. Then, Meat Loaf lost his voice and was unable to record Renegade Angel. Steinman says [...] "he sounded literally like the little girl in The Exorcist... like a dragon trying to sing—it was a horrifying sound." [...] Steinman [...] "kept writing the music to Bat Out of Hell part 2... my sequel." [...] Not being able to [...] "bear for people not to hear those songs," [...] Steinman recorded the album, retitled Bad for Good, as a solo project, although Rory Dodd contributed lead vocals on some songs. Four songs from Bad for Good were included on Bat Out of Hell II. In 1989, Steinman formed all-female vocal group Pandora's Box. The album, Original Sin, was a commercial flop, but featured two songs which would also appear on Bat II. Meat Loaf says [...] "Jim put [...] "It Just Won't Quit" [...] on Original Sin without <b>telling</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> could have strangled him." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 1967 interview, Eden {{explained}} {{his decision to}} resign: [...] "It was not over protocol, Chamberlain's communicating with Mussolini without <b>telling</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> never cared a goddamn, a tuppence about protocol. The reason for my resignation was that we had an agreement with Mussolini about the Mediterranean and Spain, which he was violating by sending troops to Spain, and Chamberlain wanted to have another agreement. I thought Mussolini should honour the first one before we negotiated for the second. I was trying to fight a delaying action for Britain, and I could not go along with Chamberlain's policy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brando {{was born}} on April 3, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Marlon Brando, Sr. (1895-1965), a {{pesticide}} and chemical feed manufacturer, and Dorothy Julia (née Pennebaker; 1897-1954). Brando had two older sisters, Jocelyn Brando (1919-2005) and Frances (1922-1994). His ancestry included German, Dutch, English, and Irish. His patrilineal immigrant ancestor, Johann Wilhelm Brandau, arrived in New York in the early 1700s from the Palatinate in Germany. Brando was raised a Christian Scientist. His mother, known as Dodie, was unconventional for her time; she smoked, wore trousers and drove cars. An actress herself and even a theatre administrator, she helped Henry Fonda begin his acting career. However, she was an alcoholic and often had to be brought home from Chicago bars by her husband. In his autobiography, Songs My Mother Taught Me, Brando expressed sadness when writing about his mother: [...] "The anguish that her drinking produced was that she preferred getting drunk to caring for us." [...] Dodie and Brando's father eventually joined Alcoholics Anonymous. Brando harbored far more enmity for his father, stating, [...] "I was his namesake, but nothing I did ever pleased or even interested him. He enjoyed <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> couldn't do anything right. He {{had a habit of}} <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> would never amount to anything." [...] Brando's parents moved to Evanston, Illinois, when his father's work took him to Chicago, but separated when Brando was 11 years old. His mother took the three children to Santa Ana, California, where they lived with her mother. In 1937, Brando's parents reconciled and moved together to Libertyville, Illinois, a small town north of Chicago. In 1939 and 1941, he worked as an usher at the town's only movie theatre, The Liberty.|$|E
2500|$|An {{unlikely}} romance was scripted into Mel's narrative {{when she}} began dating her boss Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). The pairing {{has been described as}} one of [...] "the most unbelievable soap couples", but Outwaite defended it in 1999, saying [...] "I know I've fancied some not particularly attractive men in my time, but I don't think Ian is actually ugly. He has a vulnerable side and that's what is attractive. When he is being all hot-headed and gets above himself then I personally don't like Ian. But when he is being vulnerable I can see the attraction. People talk to me about it all the time. I have taxi drivers <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> could do much better than Ian. The other day someone shouted that I should go back with [...] Steve Owen. It's incredible, they'd rather [...] went out with [...] a murderer than with [...] a hard-working father raising three children." [...] Their relationship was the focus of the storyline that aired to mark the Millennium celebrations, when Ian emotionally blackmailed Mel into marrying him by claiming that his daughter was dying of cancer; storylines {{in the latter part of}} 1999 focused on the build-up to a joint Millennium wedding on New Year's Eve 1999 with Barry (Shaun Williamson) and Natalie Evans (Lucy Speed). The wedding went as planned; however, Mel and Ian's marriage ended hours later as the clock struck midnight to signify the beginning of the New Year after Mel discovered Ian's lie. The Millennium Eve episodes drew in 20.89 million viewers – the biggest soap audience since the character Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) was killed off in EastEnders precisely one year earlier (New Year's Eve 1998). An EastEnders spokeswoman commented: [...] "This is a remarkable endorsement of the power of EastEnders that over 20 million viewers chose to see the Millennium celebrations in Albert Square." [...] The episodes were also broadcast on screens in London's Trafalgar Square, a typical “haunt for New Year's Eve revelers”.|$|E
