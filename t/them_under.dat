5|$|Flamininus also {{separated}} all {{coastal cities}} of Laconia from Spartan rule and placed <b>them</b> <b>under</b> Achean protection. The remains of Sparta's fleet were put under custody of these coastal cities. Nabis {{also had to}} withdraw his garrisons from Cretan cities and revoke several social and economic reforms that had strengthened Sparta's military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Isabella and her {{supporters}} Péter Petrovics and Ferenc Patócsy {{made a new}} attempt to prevent {{the execution of the}} Treaty of Nyírbátor in May 1551, but Martinuzzi defeated <b>them.</b> <b>Under</b> duress, Isabella abdicated in favor of Ferdinand on John Sigismund's behalf, in return for the two Silesian duchies and 140,000 florins on 19July. Two days later, she surrendered the Holy Crown to Ferdinand's representative, Giovanni Battista Castaldo. The Diet acknowledged their abdication and swore fealty to Ferdinand on 26July.|$|E
5|$|Like Profit making organisations, nonprofits {{and governments}} will produce Consolidated Financial Statements. These are {{generated}} {{in line with}} the reporting requirements in the country they are based or if they are large enough they may produce <b>them</b> <b>under</b> International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), an example of this is the UK based charity Oxfam. If the organisation is small it may use a cash basis accounting but larger ones generally use accrual basis accounting for their funds.|$|E
5000|$|Put <b>'Em</b> <b>Under</b> Pressure is an Irish panel {{game with}} a {{sporting}} theme hosted by Gráinne Seoige which started on RTÉ One on 18 September 2011. The show's name is taken from [...] "Put <b>'Em</b> <b>Under</b> Pressure", the official song to the Republic of Ireland national football team's 1990 World Cup campaign.|$|R

5|$|Olid next marched inland to the Naco Valley. One of his captains caught González Dávila {{and his men}} by surprise, {{and marched}} <b>them</b> <b>under</b> guard back to Naco, where they were imprisoned. Now that Olid had gained the upper hand, Briones feared his vengeance for not coming to his support, and pledged his {{allegiance}} to Hernán Cortés. Olid imprisoned Las Casas in Naco with González.|$|E
5|$|On 26 April 1915, at Wieltje, Belgium, Jemadar Mir Dast led his platoon {{with great}} bravery during the attack, and {{afterwards}} collected various {{parties of the}} regiment (when no British officers were left) and kept <b>them</b> <b>under</b> his command until the retirement was ordered. He also displayed great courage that day when he helped to carry eight British and Indian officers to safety while exposed to heavy fire.|$|E
5|$|Six German-built s were {{purchased}} {{soon after the}} KJRM was established. All six were captured by the Italians during the April 1941 invasion, and were put into service by <b>them</b> <b>under</b> new names. Five were lost prior to the Italian capitulation in September 1943, but one {{was transferred to the}} KJRM-in-exile in December of that year, and survived the war to serve in the post-war Yugoslav Navy as Pionir then Zelengora.|$|E

5|$|The IOC {{originally}} resisted funding {{by corporate}} sponsors. It {{was not until}} the retirement of IOC president Avery Brundage, in 1972, that the IOC began to explore the potential of the television medium and the lucrative advertising markets available to <b>them.</b> <b>Under</b> the leadership of Juan Antonio Samaranch the Games began to shift toward international sponsors who sought to link their products to the Olympic brand.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach was}} probably {{the first to be}} employed, since it is comparatively easy to destroy weeds by burning them or ploughing <b>them</b> <b>under,</b> and to kill larger competing herbivores. Techniques such as crop rotation, companion planting (also known as intercropping or mixed cropping), and the selective breeding of pest-resistant cultivars have a long history.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a massive}} {{expansion}} of ploughland during the Song dynasty. The government encouraged people to reclaim barren lands and put <b>them</b> <b>under</b> cultivation. Anyone who opened up new lands and paid taxes were granted permanent possession of the new land. Under this policy, the cultivated land in the Song dynasty is estimated to have reached a peak number of 720million mu, and was not surpassed by later Ming and Qing dynasties.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{saw that}} the old man was frail. The girl, they told me, was delicate. `Get straw, hay, branches--anything soft,' I shouted, `an' pile <b>'em</b> <b>under</b> the window.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep it up, boys! Snow <b>'em</b> <b>under!</b> Snow <b>'em</b> under!" [...] And {{then the}} Roxley crowd began a song, the refrain of which was: [...] "We're here to-day to bury them!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Put <b>'Em</b> <b>Under</b> Pressure" [...] was the {{official}} song to the Republic of Ireland national football team's 1990 FIFA World Cup campaign in Italy. It {{is regarded as}} an all-time classic football song.|$|R
5|$|An {{exception}} {{to all of}} this would be the Primal Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive Mind was created to control the Zerg, and eventually put <b>them</b> <b>under</b> the control of the main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.|$|E
5|$|Another American {{tradition}} {{is that of}} an apolitical military, although this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, {{but not so much}} from a lack of interest in politics as because frequently moving from state to state and living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised <b>them</b> <b>under</b> the laws of many states. Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding General of the United States Army from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established.|$|E
5|$|As Baghdad {{raised the}} spectre of an {{extensive}} network of British spies, the group again split. Pratap and von Hentig's party left on 1 June 1915 {{to make their}} way towards the Persian border. Eight days later they were received by the Turkish military commander Rauf Orbay at the Persian town of Krynd. Leaving Krynd, the party reached Turkish-occupied Kermanshah on 14 June 1915. Some members were sick with malaria and other tropical diseases. Leaving <b>them</b> <b>under</b> the care of Dr. Becker, von Hentig proceeded towards Tehran to decide on the subsequent plans with Prince Heinrich Reuss and Niedermayer.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of its}} planned {{acquisition}} of Allbritton Communications, Sinclair originally planned to sell its existing stations in three markets – Charleston, South Carolina, Birmingham, Alabama and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania – where Allbritton already owned stations, but continue to operate <b>them</b> <b>under</b> local marketing agreements. WABM and WTTO in Birmingham and WHP-TV in Harrisburg were {{to be sold to}} Deerfield Media, and WMMP in Charleston was to be sold to Howard Stirk Holdings – a broadcasting company owned by conservative pundit Armstrong Williams. Howard Stirk Holdings was also used as a sidecar for two conflicting stations in Sinclair's earlier {{acquisition of}} Barrington Broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|Attribution {{is often}} {{difficult}} with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold <b>them</b> <b>under</b> their own names. This {{may be due to}} the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due to the number of freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. A case in point is the photograph of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E
5|$|Both {{parents were}} monarchists and liberal conservatives, being {{committed}} to the emancipation reform of 1861 introduced by the reformist Tsar Alexander II; they avoided political radicals {{and there is no}} evidence that the police ever put <b>them</b> <b>under</b> surveillance for subversive thought. Every summer they holidayed at a rural manor in Kokushkino. Among his siblings, Lenin was closest to his sister Olga, whom he often bossed around; he had an extremely competitive nature and could be destructive, but usually admitted his misbehaviour. A keen sportsman, he spent much of his free time outdoors or playing chess, and excelled at school, the disciplinarian and conservative Simbirsk Classical Gimnazia.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the title}} {{referring}} to Donegal manager Jim McGuinness, the song {{has been compared}} both to the legendary sports anthem [...] "Put <b>'Em</b> <b>Under</b> Pressure" [...] {{as well as the}} iconic song [...] "Give It a Lash Jack".|$|R

5|$|Breathitt later {{served on}} the boards of regents of Kentucky State University and Morehead State University, in both cases serving with former {{political}} rival Louie B. Nunn. From 1992 to 2000, he again {{served on the}} University of Kentucky's board, acting as chairman of the board in all but his final year. During his chairmanship, he clashed with Governor Paul E. Patton over a plan to separate all of the state's community colleges (except Lexington Community College) from the university's governance and place <b>them</b> <b>under</b> a newly created body called the Kentucky Community and Technical College System. Patton's plan prevailed, and he and Breathitt later mended political fences.|$|E
5|$|Eight German-built s were {{purchased}} from Nazi Germany in the mid-to-late 1930s. Two escaped during {{the invasion of}} Yugoslavia in April 1941, and {{became part of the}} KJRM-in-exile. The remaining six were captured by the Italians and put into service by <b>them</b> <b>under</b> new designations. Two were scuttled by their crews {{at the time of the}} Italian capitulation in September 1943, and the remaining four were captured by the Germans and renamed. All four were scuttled at Salonika in October 1944. The boats that had escaped were transferred to the Yugoslav Navy at the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|Forced labourers for the Eastern Railway were {{eventually}} {{kept in a}} separate closed camp, where conditions were {{a little better than}} at the main camp at Janowska. Wiesenthal prepared architectural drawings for Adolf Kohlrautz, the senior inspector, who submitted <b>them</b> <b>under</b> his own name. To obtain contracts, construction companies paid bribes to Kohlrautz, who shared some of the money with Wiesenthal. He was able to pass along further information about the railroads to the underground and occasionally left the compound to obtain supplies, even clandestinely obtaining weapons for the Armia Krajowa and two pistols for himself, which he took along when he escaped in autumn 1943.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Divide!' sneered Pearson. 'Do {{you suppose}} I'd sell 'em? No, sir; I'd set <b>'em</b> <b>under</b> a turkey, {{or perhaps a}} big hen. Then, sir, I'd go into the great auk business. I'd sell auk eggs, and make my fortune, and yourn too.' ...|$|R

50|$|The song is {{regularly}} played in celebration at Irish homes matches. It {{was used as}} the opening theme for the compilation episode of BBC Switch series Chartjackers. In 2011, RTÉ One aired a quiz show titled Put <b>'Em</b> <b>Under</b> Pressure, presented by Gráinne Seoige.|$|R
