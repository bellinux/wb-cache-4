5|$|Amateur astronomers {{continue}} to make scientific contributions {{to the field of}} astronomy and {{it is one of the}} few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions. Amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets. They can also discover comets, and perform regular observations of variable stars. Improvements in digital <b>technology</b> <b>have</b> allowed amateurs to make impressive advances in the field of astrophotography.|$|E
5|$|For example, infant {{formulas}} traditionally were {{lacking the}} MFGM because this fraction is lost during regular dairy processing. However, more {{recent advances in}} <b>technology</b> <b>have</b> facilitated the separation of MFGM from the fat globule, allowing bovine MFGM to be added in concentrated form. The MFGM fraction is now commercially available and {{can be added to}} infant formula or other nutritional products.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Oxsilan <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> begun {{replace the}} iron and zinc {{phosphating}} general industry gradually. Oxsilan <b>technology</b> pre-treatment <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> some advantages such as environmental protection, free of harmful heavy metals, residue-free and low energy consumption, but the domestic automotive pretreatment <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> not yet applied. Through oxsilan technology, this paper carries out cycle test, stone chipping resistance, salt spray test, using cold rolled (CRS), electro-galvanized sheet (EG), {{hot dip galvanized}} sheet (HDG) and aluminum (Al) and compares with sample performance of electrophoretic coating of oxsilan technology and phosphate electrophoresis film.

5|$|Sporting {{competitions}} {{have always}} provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the {{players from the}} audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in stadium and auditorium design, {{as well as in}} recording and broadcast <b>technology,</b> <b>have</b> allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and spectator sport has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are association football and cricket. Their ultimate international competitions, the World Cup and test cricket, are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide. A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the Tour de France, unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Tesla Motors, almost all new cars in the United States are sold through dealerships, so they {{play a crucial role}} in the sales of electric vehicles, and negative attitudes can hinder early adoption of plug-in electric vehicles. Dealers decide which cars they want to stock, and a salesperson can have a big impact on how someone feels about a prospective purchase. Sales people have ample knowledge of internal combustion cars while they do not have time to learn about a technology that represents a fraction of overall sales. As with any new technology, and in the particular case of advanced technology vehicles, retailers are central to ensuring that buyers, especially those switching to a new <b>technology,</b> <b>have</b> the information and support they need to gain the full benefits of adopting this new technology.|$|E
