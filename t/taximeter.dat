25|$|Metered-rates from Logan Airport to most Boston hotels {{range from}} {{approximately}} $23.00 to $35.00. The airport fee for all taxi trips leaving Logan is $2.25 and is {{entered into the}} <b>taximeter</b> by the driver. In addition, the full $5.25 Harbor Tunnel Toll is entered into the meter for taxi trips leaving the airport via either the Sumner Tunnel or the Ted Williams Tunnel. The combined fee/toll amount ($7.50) is displayed {{on the right side}} of the taxi meter and is automatically added to the metered fare (shown on the left side of the taxi meter) when the taxi has reached the passenger's destination and the meter is stopped. Taxi trips within a 20-mile radius of Boston City Hall (Meter Zone) are charged by running the <b>taximeter.</b> Taxi drivers will quote fare amounts from the Official Boston Police Department Flat-Rate Handbook to destinations outside the 20-mile radius. Additionally, the city of Boston allows its taxis to collect half ($2.75) the Harbor Tunnel Toll on trips to Logan Airport. No airport fee is collected on taxi trips to the airport. As of April 2009, all Boston taxicabs accept fare payment by credit or debit card. The passenger is walked through a series of steps displayed on a touch-screen in the rear passenger compartment of the taxi. Upon request, a meter-generated receipt will be issued.|$|E

2500|$|The {{passenger}} {{is required}} to pay the amount on the <b>taximeter</b> plus any additional tolls or fees. The initial entry, sometimes called a [...] "meter drop" [...] or [...] "flag pull", is $3.25 regardless of distance traveled. Each additional fraction of a mile charge is $.20 for each additional 1/9 of a mile. Additionally, each 36 seconds of time elapsed, known as [...] "wait time", is $.20. This charge is in place to ensure the driver still makes money if the cab is stuck in bad traffic. There is a flat fee of $1.00 for the first additional passenger and another $.50 for each additional passenger after that unless the passenger is under 12 or over 65 years of age.|$|E

2500|$|Although Uber itself, as the provider, {{is fully}} legal in Poland, drivers work illegally.

The meters and updates are part of an integrated electronic payment and radio dispatch system with other taxi equipment supplied by Cabcharge.|$|R
