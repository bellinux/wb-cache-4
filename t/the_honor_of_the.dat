5|$|In March 1919, Princess Matoika and Rijndam raced {{each other}} from Saint-Nazaire to Newport News in a {{friendly}} competition that received national press coverage in the United States. Rijndam, the slower ship, was just able to edge out the Princess—and cut two days from her previous fastest crossing time—by appealing to <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers of the 133rd Field Artillery (returning home aboard the former Holland America liner) and employing them as extra stokers for her boilers.|$|E
5|$|Géza {{married a}} niece of Nikephoros Botaneiates, a close advisor of Emperor Michael VII. However, Solomon still {{controlled}} Moson and Pressburg; the royal troopswhich {{were under the}} command of Géza's brother, Ladislauscould not take Pressburg in 1076. According to the Illuminated Chronicle, Géza considered renouncing the crown in favor of Solomon {{from the end of the}} year. Géza died on 15 April 1077 and was buried in the cathedral of Vác, which he had erected in <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Virgin. His brother, Ladislaus succeeded him. A grave discovered in the center of the medieval cathedral in August 2015 was identified as Géza's burial site by Zoltán Batizi, the leader of the excavations.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, the Aggies {{upset the}} Texas Longhorns, winning 20–16 {{in the annual}} rivalry game. The game began with a flyover of F-16 jets, all piloted by former A students, in the missing man formation. This flyover was donated by Senator Phil Gramm who, as an elected official, had {{the title of a}} fly-over reserved for his death and asked that the fly-over be given instead in <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 12 Aggies that died. At halftime, the Texas Longhorn Band dedicated their performance to the students lost and injured in the collapse, and ended by playing Amazing Grace and Taps, then removing their white hats in a show of respect as they walked off the field. The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band also played a tribute to the fallen and, contrary to the usual tradition, marched off the field in a silent cadence. Aggie students, who normally sit only when the opposing band plays, stood throughout both performances and gave both standing ovations.|$|E

The painting Carrito de Piraguas ("Piragua Pushcart") is a mixed media piece by an unknown artist, on exhibit at El Museo del Barrio in New York. Puerto Rican artist Iván Moura Limardo created various paintings related to the piragua. Among them are Piragüero 5 and Piragüero 10, which are on display in the Siena Art Gallery in San Juan. The town of Coamo commissioned the creation of a monument in <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piragüeros.

Dunant died nine years later in the small Swiss health resort of Heiden. Only two months earlier his long-standing adversary Gustave Moynier had also died, leaving a mark in the history of the Committee as its longest-serving president ever.|$|E

25|$|Some Jews {{believe that}} strict Jewish law {{requires}} that one should fast {{on the day of}} a parent's Yahrzeit; although most believe this is not required, some people do observe the custom of fasting {{on the day of the}} Yahrtzeit, or at least refraining from meat and wine. Among many Orthodox Jews it has become customary to make a siyum by completing a tractate of Talmud or a volume of the Mishnah on the day prior to the Yahrtzeit, in <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased. A halakha requiring a siyum ("celebratory meal"), upon the completion of such a study, overrides the requirement to fast.|$|E

Also, Ginebra was more popular in Metro Manila and Luzon and in classes ABC, while Purefoods was more popular in Visayas and Mindanao and in class D. The two teams were tied for most supporters in class E. In terms of percentage of supporters, the {{survey showed that}}, after Ginebra and Purefoods (which both got 31%), are Magnolia (21%), Alaska (13%), Sta.

25|$|In {{agreeing to}} pay a ransom of $60,000 for the American prisoners, the Jefferson {{administration}} drew a distinction between paying tribute and paying ransom. At the time, some argued that buying sailors out of slavery was a fair exchange to end the war. William Eaton, however, remained bitter {{for the rest of}} his life about the treaty, feeling that his efforts had been squandered by the American emissary from the U.S. Department of State, diplomat Tobias Lear. Eaton and others felt that the capture of Derna should have been used as a bargaining chip to obtain the release of all American prisoners without having to pay ransom. Furthermore, Eaton believed <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States had been compromised when it abandoned Hamet Karamanli after promising to restore him as leader of Tripoli. Eaton's complaints generally went unheard, especially as attention turned to the strained international relations which would ultimately lead to the withdrawal of the U.S. Navy from the area in 1807 and to the War of 1812.|$|E

25|$|The {{possible}} {{confusion of}} whether Zheng He undertook the second voyage {{stemmed from the}} fact that a Chinese envoy was dispatched before Zheng He had departed with {{the main body of the}} fleet. The imperial edict for the third voyage was issued during the period of the second voyage whilst the treasure fleet was still in the Indian Ocean. So either Zheng He was absent when the court issued the imperial order or he had not accompanied the fleet during the second voyage. On 21 January 1409, a grand ceremony was held in <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goddess Tianfei, where she received a new title. J.J.L. Duyvendak thinks that Zheng He could not have been on the second voyage, because this ceremony was so important that it required Zheng He's attendance. Mills (1970), citing Duyvendak, also states that Zheng He did not accompany the fleet for this voyage. However, Fei Xin explicitly mentions Zheng He when describing the 1409 stop at Pulau Sembilan, which strongly suggests that Zheng He had been on the second voyage according to Dreyer (2007).|$|E
25|$|In May 2012, borough {{officials}} in Palisades Park rejected requests by two diplomatic delegations from Japan {{to remove a}} small monument from a public park, a brass plaque on a block of stone, dedicated in 2010 {{to the memory of}} so-called comfort women, tens of thousands of women and girls, many Korean, who were forced into sexual slavery by Japanese soldiers during World War II. Days later, a South Korean delegation endorsed the borough's decision. However, in neighboring Fort Lee, various Korean American groups could not reach consensus on the design and wording for such a monument as of early April 2013. In October 2012, a similar memorial was announced in nearby Hackensack, to be raised behind the Bergen County Courthouse, alongside memorials to the Holocaust, the Irish Potato Famine, and the Armenian Genocide, and was unveiled in March 2013. An apology and monetary compensation of roughly US$8 million by Japan to South Korea in December 2015 for these transgressions largely fell flat in Koreatown, Palisades Park. An annual cross-country bicycle ride dedicated to <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> comfort women ends at the Palisades Park memorial, following a penultimate stop at the Bergen County Courthouse memorial in Hackensack.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} honor is another social {{characteristic}} Holý identifies as being related to Middle Eastern cousin marriage. <b>The</b> <b>honor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> males surrounding {{a woman is}} sullied in many societies when she misbehaves or when she is attacked. In societies like Europe that place greater value on affinal relations, responsibility for a married woman rests with both her husband's family and her own. In the Middle East the situation is different in that primary responsibility continues to rest with the woman's own family even after she is married. Her agnates therefore cannot release her from control upon marriage due to the risk to their honor. They and not the husband {{may be responsible for}} killing her, or sometimes her lover, if she commits adultery. Similar rules may apply in case of the payment if she is killed and for the inheritance of her property if she has no male heirs. Her natal family may continue supporting her even against her husband. This is an idealized system: some Middle Eastern societies do mix it with other systems that assign more responsibility to the husband's family.|$|E
