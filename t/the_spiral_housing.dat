500|$|Zvi Hecker {{architecture}} {{has continued}} to emphasize geometry and modularity, but with increasing asymmetry. Ramot Polin (1972–75) is a rare prefabricated apartment complex with 720 non-rectangular components. The apartments were expanded later, incorporating more cubic rather than pentagonal components. The design idea of this neighborhood {{may seem to be}} the more purely geometrical, however it is likened to a chemical structure, and in plan view to an open hand, and a leaf- therefore imparting it with metaphorical qualities. More examples of advanced geometry in Hecker's work are <b>the</b> <b>Spiral</b> Apartment <b>House</b> in Ramat Gan, (1981–1989), and the Heinz-Galinski-Schule (1992–1995) in Berlin, noted for their high degree of complexity. The Heinz-Galinski-Schule won Zvi Hecker the Deutscher Kritikerpreis in 1995- it was stated that the decision of the jury was based on their appreciation of the [...] "expressive geometry of his construction." [...] <b>The</b> <b>Spiral</b> Apartment <b>House</b> is located adjacent to his earlier Dubiner house, providing a juxtaposition of two important moments in his career. The work of Zvi Hecker has been compared to that of Antonio Gaudi, for expressiveness and expanding of architectural ideas.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} apraxia {{in healthy}} elderly and in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: We evaluated 136 subjects {{with an average}} age of 75. 74 years (minimum 60 years old, maximum 92 years old) and average schooling of 9 years (minimum of 7 and a maximum of 12 years), using the Mini-Mental State examination (MMSE), Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG) and the Clock Drawing Test. For the analysis of the presence of apraxia, eight subitems from the CAMCOG were selected: the drawings of <b>the</b> pentagon, <b>spiral,</b> <b>house,</b> clock; and <b>the</b> tasks of putting a piece of paper in an envelope; the correct one hand waiving "Goodbye" movements; paper cutting using scissors; and brushing teeth. RESULTS: Elder controls had an average score of 11. 51, compared to MCI (11. 13), and AD patients, whose average apraxia test scores were the lowest (10. 23). Apraxia scores proved able to differentiate the three groups studied (p= 0. 001). In addition, a negative correlation was observed between apraxia and MMSE scores. CONCLUSION: We conclude that testing for the presence of apraxia is important in the evaluation of patients with cognitive impairments and may help to differentiate elderly controls, MCI and AD...|$|R
40|$|I {{estimate}} the long-run {{demand for housing}} to be, at most, 1. 6 million units per year. This compares to housing starts of two million in 2004 and again in 2005. This overbuilding is {{the primary cause of}} the current housing glut, which I estimate to be between 1. 24 and 1. 72 million units. It will thus take several years for the excess vacant units to be fully absorbed. This housing glut needs to be quantified because it is the primary cause of <b>the</b> downward <b>spiral</b> in <b>housing</b> prices. I argue that overbuilding aggravates economic instability considerably. I suggest that Federal Reserve forecasters develop estimates of the long-run demand for housing, and that these be considered in implementing monetary policy. ...|$|R

50|$|For {{the first}} time in the series, the game was based on console {{development}} and released as a multiplatform title. Darkworks handled the development of the PlayStation and Dreamcast versions, the latter being released one month after the PlayStation version and featuring major graphic improvements instead of being a direct port. <b>Spiral</b> <b>House</b> ported <b>the</b> Dreamcast version to Windows and it was released at the same time of the Dreamcast version, but the Windows version suffers from sound conversion issues which turn the overall soundtrack of the game into noticeable worse quality renditions. <b>Spiral</b> <b>House</b> also ported <b>the</b> Dreamcast version to the PlayStation 2 and released it several months after, with the added improvement of lip synchronization for the polygon models during cutscenes. The game uses the Nocturne Engine, which was originally developed for Nocturne, a 1999 survival horror game.|$|R

40|$|We present Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) {{simulations}} of molecular cloud formation in spiral galaxies. These simulations model {{the response of}} a non-self-gravitating gaseous disk to a galactic potential. <b>The</b> <b>spiral</b> shock induces high densities in the gas, and considerable structure in <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> arms, which we identify as molecular clouds. We regard the formation of these structures as due to the dynamics of clumpy shocks, which perturb the flow of gas through <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> arms. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> shocks induce a large velocity dispersion in <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> arms, comparable with {{the magnitude of the}} velocity dispersion observed in molecular clouds. We estimate the formation of molecular hydrogen, by post-processing our results and assuming the gas is isothermal. Provided the gas is cold (T< 100 K), the gas is compressed sufficiently in <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> shock for molecular hydrogen formation to occur in <b>the</b> dense <b>spiral</b> arm clumps. These molecular clouds are largely confined to <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> arms, since most molecular gas is photodissociated to atomic hydrogen upon leaving the arms.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>spiral</b> {{component}} of blood flow has both beneficial and detrimental effects in human circulatory system [Stonebridge PA, Brophy CM. Spiral laminar flow in arteries? Lancet 1991; 338 : 1360 – 1]. We investigate {{the effects of}} <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> blood flow in a model of three-dimensional arterial stenosis with a 75 % cross-sectional area reduction at the centre by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. The standard &# 954;–&# 969; model is employed for simulation of the blood flow for the Reynolds number of 500 and 1000. We find that for Re = 500 <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> {{component of}} <b>the</b> blood flow increases both the total pressure and velocity of the blood, and some significant differences are found between the wall shear stresses of <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> and non-spiral induced flow downstream of the stenosis. The turbulent kinetic energy is reduced by <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> flow as it induces the rotational stabilities in the forward flow. For Re = 1000 the tangential component of the blood velocity is most influenced by <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> speed, but <b>the</b> effect of <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> flow on <b>the</b> centreline turbulent kinetic energy and shear stress is mild.

5000|$|Another {{criticism}} of <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> of silence research {{is that the}} research designs do not observe the movement in <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> over time.

They argue that <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> of silence theory involves a [...] "time factor", considering that the changes in public opinion eventually lead to change in people's assessments of the public opinion. Also, according to Spilchal, <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> of silence theory [...] "ignores the evidence of the historical development of public opinion, both in theory and practice, through the extension of suffrage, organisation of political propaganda groups, the establishment of pressure groups and political parties, the eligibility of ever wider circles of public officials and, eventually, the installation of several forms of direct democracy." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{manufacturing}} of {{chain-link fencing}} is called weaving.

When <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> reaches <b>the</b> far end of <b>the</b> fence, <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> is cut near the blade. Next, <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> is pressed flat and the entire fence is moved up, {{ready for the next}} cycle.

30|$|During the {{polishing}} process, it {{was found}} that the surface roughness of <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> groove and <b>the</b> outer surface were not changed much at 5, 10, and 15  min, and the surface roughness was significantly lower than that of <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> groove at a time of 20  min.

40|$|The primary {{thesis of}} this {{position}} paper is that process programming {{is analogous to}} programming in an key respect not previously emphasized: that it will proceed more effectively if preceded {{by a set of}} activities to determine the requirements, architecture, and design of the process. 1. <b>The</b> <b>Spiral</b> Model <b>The</b> <b>Spiral</b> Model [Boehm, 19 S 6; Belz, 19 S 6] provides a candidate approach to determining the requirements, architecture, and design of a software process. <b>The</b> <b>Spiral</b> Model activity of determining mission objectives and constraints addresses the requirements for the process: the nature of the product required; budget and schedule constraints; organizational and procedural (e. g. contracting) constraints, etc. <b>The</b> <b>Spiral</b> Model "alternatives " activity addresses process architecture and design considerations: the use of prototypes, simulations and competitive concept definition phases; the choice of incremental products, cutover strategies, and integration strategies; the use of design-to-cost, independent V & V contractors, etc. The choice of process architecture is obtained in <b>the</b> <b>Spiral</b> Model by determining which alternative process architecture minimizes the risk of not meeting the system objectives within the system constraints. 2. Applying Process Programming to <b>the</b> <b>Spiral</b> Model Applying process programming to <b>the</b> <b>Spiral</b> Model appeared to the authors to be a useful exercise in two main respects: • to see how well process programming approaches addressed process architecture and design issues; • to better understand the ramifications of <b>the</b> <b>Spiral</b> Model <b>The</b> authors developed an initial top-level formulation of <b>the</b> <b>Spiral</b> Model, using a rather conventional process programming approach. The language we used was a version of Ada based partly on [Osterweil, 1986] and informally (though, we hope, precisely) adapted to our purpose. The resulting process program contained roughly 150 lines. It was expressed as an iterative loop through the four main elements of <b>the</b> <b>Spiral</b> Model (see Figure 1), with succeeding cycles through <b>the</b> <b>spiral</b> represented as a refinement of a project database of product and processT [...] ...|$|R
