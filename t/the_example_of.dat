5|$|According to Pauling's first rule, {{successive}} pK {{values of}} a given acid increase (pKa2 > pKa1).

5|$|Sexual {{selection}} as first articulated by Darwin (using <b>the</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the peacock's tail) refers specifically to competition for mates, {{which can be}} intrasexual, between individuals of the same sex, that is male–male competition, or intersexual, where one gender chooses mates, most often with males displaying and females choosing. However, in some species, mate choice is primarily by males, as in some fishes of the family Syngnathidae.|$|E

5|$|Born in Braco in Perthshire, Scotland, McGregor {{first became}} {{interested}} in football after watching a match between locals and visiting artisans at Ardoch. He served an apprenticeship as a draper in Perth, and in 1870, following <b>the</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> his brother Peter, moved to Birmingham, and opened his own drapery business in Aston, an area just outside the city. Upon his arrival in the English Midlands he became involved with a local football club, Calthorpe, which had been formed by a fellow Scot, Campbell Orr. McGregor was enthusiastic enough about the game to arrange for his shop to close early on Saturdays {{to allow him to}} watch matches, and he later sold football kits at the shop, which became a popular meeting place for football enthusiasts.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{believed}} in the humanist ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose authority depended on letters as well as arms. She was inspired by <b>the</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> her father-in-law, King Francis I of France, who had hosted the leading artists of Europe at his court, and by her Medici ancestors. In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display. Once {{in control of the}} royal purse, she launched a programme of artistic patronage that lasted for three decades. During this time, she presided over a distinctive late French Renaissance culture in all branches of the arts.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the general}} custom of Europe {{in the late}} {{classical}} and early Middle Ages, he was popularly recognised after his death as a saint, along with several hundred other Welsh men and women. But the date and circumstances of {{the foundation of the}} church, and of Padarn's life were long forgotten when it was decided in the twelfth century that he should be commemorated in a Vita or Latin Life, following <b>the</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the Life of St David written at Llanbadarn about 1090. That in turn had followed a European tradition of writing such lives. They are not biographies as we understand them today. Instead they were hagiographies, designed to elevate the saint’s status as a holy person of miraculous achievements.|$|E
5|$|For {{substances}} in solution the isoelectric point (pI) {{is defined as}} the pH at which the sum, weighted by charge value, of concentrations of positively charged species is equal to the weighted sum of concentrations of negatively charged species. In the case that there is one species of each type, the isoelectric point can be obtained directly from the pK values. Take <b>the</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> glycine, defined as AH. There are two dissociation equilibria to consider.|$|E
5|$|Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual's perception of society. This book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society. A frame {{is a set of}} concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, is the study of the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives <b>the</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a picture frame: a person uses the frame (which represents structure) to hold together his picture (which represents the content) of what he is experiencing in his life.|$|E
