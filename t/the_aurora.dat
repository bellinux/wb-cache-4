5|$|A giant {{meteoroid}} {{approaches the}} earth, spotted from an observatory by Professor Decimus Phostle, while a self-proclaimed prophet, Philippulus, predicts {{the end of}} the world. The meteoroid misses the earth, but a fragment of it plunges into the Arctic Ocean. Phostle determines that the object is made of a new material which he names Phostlite, and sets off to find it with a crew of European scientists. Accompanied by Tintin and Snowy, their ship, <b>the</b> <b>Aurora,</b> is helmed by Tintin's friend Captain Haddock. Meanwhile, another team has set out aboard the polar expedition ship Peary, backed by the financier Mr. Bohlwinkel; wherefore, the expedition becomes a race to land on the meteorite. On the day of departure, Bohlwinkel has a henchman plant a stick of dynamite on <b>the</b> <b>Aurora,</b> but it is found and thrown overboard. In the North Sea, <b>the</b> <b>Aurora</b> is almost rammed by another of Bohlwinkel's ships, but Haddock steers out of the way. Further setbacks occur at the Icelandic port of Akureyri, when Haddock is informed that there is no fuel available. He and Tintin then come across an old friend of his, Captain Chester, who reveals that there is plenty of fuel and that the Golden Oil Company (which has a fuel monopoly) is owned by Bohlwinkel. The three then secretly run a hose from Chester's ship, Sirius, to <b>the</b> <b>Aurora,</b> and thus trick Golden Oil into providing the fuel they need.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{decide to}} go to the North Pole to kill Santa, but Brian does not want Stewie to get {{disappointed}} if Santa is not what everybody thinks he is; to this Stewie responds that Brian is as negative as Eeyore from Winnie-the-Pooh. To prevent Stewie from going to the North Pole he tells him that Santa is not real; Stewie questions this, also asking if Elmo, SpongeBob SquarePants and Curious George aren't real. On their way to the North Pole, Brian and Stewie find themselves in Canada, where they meet a man with a thick Canadian accent; they also see <b>the</b> <b>Aurora</b> borealis and <b>the</b> <b>Aurora</b> Boreanaz (an aurora with David Boreanaz's face).|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} it was {{suggested}} that a different <b>aurora</b> from <b>the</b> present one had occured on the Earth. The author called it <b>the</b> paleo <b>aurora.</b> <b>The</b> paleo <b>aurora</b> might have occurred on the primitive Earth about 4 billion years ago, when the Earth had an atmosphere dominantly of carbon dioxide. The spectrum of <b>the</b> paleo <b>aurora</b> was expected. Then, it is natural to consider that the spectrum of <b>the</b> paleo <b>aurora</b> and <b>the</b> spectrum of <b>the</b> present <b>aurora</b> should differ from each other because of the difference of the atmospheric compositions. However, {{there is a possibility that}} the spectrum of <b>the</b> paleo <b>aurora</b> was almost <b>the</b> same as the spectrum of <b>the</b> present <b>aurora</b> although <b>the</b> atmospheric compositions was completely different from the present one. In addition to the spectrum, other features about <b>the</b> paleo <b>aurora</b> was expected. Then it can be concluded that <b>the</b> paleo <b>aurora</b> had occurred at higher latitudes on average than it does today and that <b>the</b> paleo <b>aurora</b> was more active than it is today. <b>The</b> paleo <b>aurora</b> is a thing of the past. However <b>the</b> paleo <b>aurora</b> may be observed in the extra-solar systems in the foreseeable future. Content...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>aurorae</b> of Saturn {{are highly}} variable. Their {{location}} and brightness strongly {{depends on the}} Solar wind pressure: <b>the</b> <b>aurorae</b> become brighter and move closer to the poles when the Solar wind pressure increases. The bright auroral features are observed to rotate with the angular speed of 60–75% that of Saturn. From time to time bright features appear in the dawn sector of the main oval or inside it. The average total power emitted by <b>the</b> <b>aurorae</b> is about 50GW in the far ultraviolet (80–170nm) and 150–300GW in the near-infrared (3–4μm—H3+ emissions) parts of the spectrum.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Aurora</b> {{arrived at}} Cape Denison on 13 January 1913. When Mawson's party failed to return, Davis sailed her east {{along the coast}} {{as far as the}} Mertz Glacier tongue, searching for the party. Finding no sign and {{reaching}} the end of the navigable ice-free water, they returned to Cape Denison. The oncoming winter concerned Davis, and on 8 February—just hours before Mawson's return to the hut—the ship departed Commonwealth Bay, leaving six men behind as a relief party. Upon Mawson's return, <b>the</b> <b>Aurora</b> was recalled by wireless radio, but powerful katabatic winds sweeping down from the plateau prevented the ship's boat from reaching the shore to collect the men.|$|E
5|$|Close to the Peary, <b>the</b> <b>Aurora</b> {{receives}} an indistinct distress call from another ship and alters its course to help, but inquiries by Tintin expose that the distress signal is a decoy to delay them. Resuming the journey, they intercept a cable announcing that the Peary expedition {{has reached the}} meteorite but not yet claimed it. While the Peary crew rows to the meteorite, Tintin uses the Auroras seaplane to parachute onto the meteorite and plant the expedition's flag. Tintin makes camp while the Auroras engines are repaired after developing trouble. The next day he discovers that Phostlite accelerates growth, and makes things much larger: his apple core grows into a large tree while a maggot grows into a huge butterfly, and Tintin is menaced by a giant spider that escaped from his lunch box, and immense, explosive mushrooms before rescue arrives. A sudden seaquake shakes the meteorite to its core and it sinks into the sea, just as Tintin and Snowy escape to <b>the</b> <b>Aurora</b> {{with a piece of}} Phostlite. Thereafter Bohlwinkel learns that he is expected to be tried for his crimes. As <b>the</b> <b>Aurora</b> returns home, Captain Haddock steers the ship toward land to refuel not with oil, but with whiskey.|$|E

Mawson staggered back into the Cape Denison hut a month later, missing <b>the</b> <b>Aurora</b> by a matter of hours; she had waited for Mertz, Mawson and Ninnis for three weeks until—concerned by the encroaching winter ice—Davis had sailed her out of Commonwealth Bay and back to Australia.|$|E

5|$|A greater misfortune {{occurred}} {{at the onset of}} the southern winter when <b>the</b> <b>Aurora,</b> locked in an ice-floe which broke off from the main shelf, was torn from its moorings. The ocean currents then pulled ship further away from the sledding parties marooned on shore and drifted for over six months before breaking free of the ice. Sadly the Aurora's damaged rudder forced her to return to New Zealand rather than returning for the stranded shore party.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had done}} for other Adventures of Tintin which {{featured}} sea travel, Hergé was careful to obtain as much data about ships as possible {{in order to make}} his portrayals more realistic. The design of <b>the</b> <b>Aurora</b> was based on the RRS William Scoresby, while that of the Peary was most likely based upon another Antarctic ship, the RRS Discovery. The seaplane on which the expedition travels was based on the German Arado 196-A. Hergé nevertheless later criticised his own efforts in this area, saying that if Aurora had been a real ship, it would probably be unseaworthy.|$|E

5|$|Assisting {{him on this}} Far Eastern Party {{would be}} Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Fusiliers, and the Swiss ski expert Xavier Mertz.

Ninnis and Mertz had spent the winter preparing the dogs for the journey, sewing harnesses and teaching them to run in teams with the sledges.

5|$|In late December 2014, NASA's MAVEN {{spacecraft}} detected {{evidence of}} widespread auroras in Mars's northern hemisphere and descended to approximately 20–30 degrees North latitude of Mars's equator.
