Participants {{are given a}} timeline with intervals (e.g., 5 years per interval) and asked to fill in events <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> and indicate age during the event. This gives the participant the ability to recall freely rather than be limited to artificial cue- words. The time intervals focus the participant on certain periods and control {{the amount of time}} spent searching for memories.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the first}} {{thoughts}} <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> for most machinists regarding threading are of thread cutting processes (such as tapping, single-pointing, or helical milling), Smid points out that, when plastic bottles for food, beverages, personal care products, and other consumer products are considered, {{it is actually}} plastic molding that is the principal method (by sheer volume) of thread generation in manufacturing today. Of course, this fact {{highlights the importance of}} the moldmakers getting the mold just right (in preparation for millions of cycles, usually at high speed).|$|E
25|$|The {{estimates}} of likelihood {{associated with the}} optimistic bias are based on how closely an event matches a person's overall idea of the specific event. Some researchers suggest that the representativeness heuristic is {{a reason for the}} optimistic bias: individuals tend to think in stereotypical categories rather than about their actual targets when making comparisons. For example, when drivers are asked to think about a car accident, {{they are more likely to}} associate a bad driver, rather than just the average driver. Individuals compare themselves with the negative elements <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind,</b> rather than an overall accurate comparison between them and another driver. Additionally, when individuals were asked to compare themselves towards friends, they chose more vulnerable friends based on the events they were looking at. Individuals generally chose a specific friend based on whether they resemble a given example, rather than just an average friend. People find examples that relate directly to what they are asked, resulting in representativeness heuristics.|$|E

[...] Place branding is required to make a country's image acceptable for investment, tourism, political power, etc. [...] As Joseph Nye commented, [...] "in an information age, it is often the side which has the better side of the story that wins," [...] this has resulted in a shift from old style diplomacy to encompass brand building {{and reputation}} management. [...] In short, a country can use its culture to create a brand for itself which represents positive values and image.|$|E

This mechanism for biasing attention ensures a speedy response in familiar situations, but it can lead to errors when the first thought <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> is not appropriate.
