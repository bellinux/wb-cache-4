40|$|Two {{series of}} {{functionalised}} carbonaceous adsorbents were prepared {{by means of}} oxidation and nitrogenation of commercially available activated carbon and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The effect of nitrogen and oxygen incorporation on the textural, surface, thermal and sorption properties of the adsorbents prepared was tested. The materials were characterized by elemental analysis, low-temperature nitrogen sorption, <b>thermogravimetric</b> study and <b>determination</b> of the surface oxygen groups content. Sorptive properties of the materials obtained were characterized by the adsorption of methylene and alkali blue 6 B as well as copper(II) ions. The final products were nitrogen- and oxygen-enriched mesoporous adsorbents of medium-developed surface area, showing highly diverse N and O-heteroatom contents and acidic-basic character of the surface.

30|$|The {{availability}} of straightforward, multigram syntheses for many classes of β-diketiminates has generated widespread {{popularity of the}} ligand for coordination and organometallic chemistry. Prototypical symmetrical β-diketimines with N-aryl substituents can be synthesized in one step from commercially available anilines and diones through simple condensation reactions (McGeachin 1968; Stender et al. 2001). β-Diketiminates with aliphatic nitrogen substituents can also be prepared by related condensation routes, but often require harsh reagents such as oxonium salts for complete diimine formation (Kuhn et al. 1999). Other variants of the β-diketiminate scaffold have been recently discussed in a comprehensive review (Bourget-Merle et al. 2002). Herein, we demonstrate a synthetic pathway for unsymmetrical β-diketimines and provide detailed characterization by spectroscopic (1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and mass) methods, melting point <b>determination,</b> <b>thermogravimetric</b> analysis (TGA), differential temperature analysis (DTA), and elemental analysis. In addition, the solid state structures of the compounds 4 a-d have been analyzed by single crystal X-ray diffraction.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{mononuclear}} supramolecule of copper(II) {{has been}} synthesized with Ippyt ligand (Ippyt= 3 -(4 '-imidazole phenyl) - 5 -(pyrid- 2 ''-yl) - 1, 2, 4 -triazole) (1). Compound 1, namely [Cu(Ippyt) 2 (H 2 O) 2], {{has been characterized}} by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, IR spectrum, elemental analysis and <b>thermogravimetric</b> analysis. Structure <b>determination</b> reveals that the elongated-octahedral geometry is formed {{in the vicinity of}} the copper (II) atom being coordinated by four nitrogen atoms from two Ippyt ligands occupying the equatorial position and two oxygen atoms from two coordinated water molecules in the axial position, which together form the N 4 O 2 donor set. Hydrogen bonding interactions between nitrogen and oxygen atoms result in the set up of a supramolecular network architecture. Biological properties including antibacterial activity and superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic activity of compound 1 have been investigated by agar diffusion method and the modified Marklund method, respectively. The results indicate that compound 1 exhibits a stronger antibacterial efficiency than the parent ligand and it also has a certain radical-scavenging activity...|$|R
40|$|A {{high voltage}} {{composite}} insulator showed severe degradation and {{failure of the}} silicone elastomer sheds following service in a substation environment. Sensitive analytical techniques were used to investigate the extent of degradation of the silicone elastomer (SiE). The polymer content of some surface regions decreased as degradation increased. This was quantified through observation by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), weight loss upon heating using <b>thermogravimetric</b> analysis (TGA), <b>determination</b> of surface "silica" levels in damaged areas by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman mapping through a cross-section of the elastomer producing a degradation depth profile. It is believed that due to the environmental conditions {{at the site of}} installation, the electric field may have reached corona onset threshold on parts of the elastomer surface. Because of the moist conditions the corona was maintained, effectively preventing the elastomer from regaining hydrophobicity and leading in time to severe degradation. This investigation has also identified techniques applicable to the assessment of condition of other, less damaged SiE insulators which may in turn lead to the prediction of the remaining useful lifetime...|$|R

40|$|Halloysite {{nanotubes}} (HNTs) {{are considered}} an ideal materials for biotechnological and medical applications. The study {{of interaction between}} nanopaticles/nanotubes and proteins is important because the modifications that biological molecules undergo upon their interaction with nanostructured materials may alter their function. Protein aggregation into amyloid fibrils is implicated in severe neurodegenerative diseases and nanoparticles are known to interfere with protein amyloid formation but no studies are reported on the conformational changes induced by nanoparticle or nanotubes on the aggregated proteins. In this thesis, I studied the interactions between halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) and proteins using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Thermogravimetric analysis. This study can be diveded in two part: 1) Study of the conformational changes induced by surface interaction between halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) and aggregated bovine serum albumin (BSA) and non-aggregated BSA using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). We also investigated, as comparison, the interaction between BSA and Kaolite (Kao), that have the same composition of HNTs but different structure. We show cleary that the conformational changes of BSA depend by protein concentration, by clay morphology and by amount of clay used. In the case of aggregate protein, the interaction with flat surface of Kao promotes formation of desordered structures for low Kao/BSA ratio {{and there is no}} interaction for high Kao/BSA ratio. While, in the all investigated range of HNTs/BSA ratio, the interaction with curved nanoscale surface of HNTs promotes the convertion of aggregated BSA to more ordered structure. The interaction of non-aggregated proteins with clays promotes the convertion of BSA to partial aggregated structure for low Clay/BSA ratio and BSA interacts poorly or not for high Clay/BSA ratio. 2) Loading of HNTs with proteins: spectroscopic and thermogravimetric study. The protein investigated are Bovine serum albumin, Alpha lacalbumin and Beta lactoglobulin. I used the <b>thermogravimetric</b> analysis to <b>determination</b> of HNTs loading and FTIR to study the conformational changes of protein induced by this interaction with HNTs. The results showed that proteins interact with HNTs and ordered secondary structures increased. These results have demonstrated that HNTs interfere with the alpha-beta transition of proteins which is responsible of many several severe diseases (protein misfolding) but further studies are needed to generalize the effects observed in this work to specific proteins associated with severe diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes type 2, etc...|$|R

Esses produtos incluem as cinzas volantes, as cinzas pesadas ou de fundo, a escÃria da caldeira, e o gesso do FGD - Flue Gas Desulfurization. Embora alguns PCCs sejam reutilizados como matÃria-prima para a construÃÃo civil, a maioria deles Ã depositada em aterros ou represas de contenÃÃo. AlÃm de ocupar vastas extensÃes de terra, existe uma grande preocupaÃÃo com o fato de que produtos quÃmicos tÃxicos dos PCCs podem {{dissolver}} na Ãgua e essa Ãgua poluÃda pode lixiviar, contaminando tanto Ãguas subterrÃneas quanto superficiais. Este trabalho teve como objetivo fabricar e caracterizar peÃas cerÃmicas a partir de resÃduos da extraÃÃo do granito Asa Branca, com adiÃÃo de produtos gerados pela combustÃo do carvÃo de uma usina termoelÃtrica. Foram avaliadas a microestrutura e algumas propriedades fÃsicas e mecÃnicas dessas peÃas. Os materiais utilizados foram granito Asa Branca e o subproduto da combustÃo do carvÃo mineral (fornecido pela Energia de Portugal â EDP), nas concentraÃÃes de 10 %p, 20 %p e 30 %p.

During {{the burning}} of mineral coal a series of different residues or byproducts (coal combustion products, or CCPs) are generated. These byproducts include fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag, and flue gas desulfurization gypsum. Although some types of CCPs {{can be used as}} alternative raw materials for construction products, the majority of them are deposited in landfills or surface impoundments. Besides the occupation of large areas there is a major concern with the fact that toxic chemicals from the CCPs can dissolve in water, and this polluted water can spread underground, contaminating both groundwater and surface waters. The present work investigated the fabrication and characterization of ceramic products made from Asa Branca granite powder with the addition of products generated by the combustion of mineral coal in a power plant. The microstructure and some physical and mechanical properties of these parts were evaluated. The materials used were Asa Branca Granite and a mixture of CCPs supplied by EDP (Energia de Portugal) which were added in the concentrations of 10, 20 and 30 % wt. to the granite matrix. The following techniques were used for the characterization of the materials: X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), <b>Thermogravimetric</b> Analysis (TGA). <b>Determination</b> of physical properties was performed by means of Surface Contraction and Weight Loss tests; Water Absorption and Vickers Microhardness. The results showed that the use of products generated by the combustion of coal as reinforcements for the parts made from Asa Branca Granite powder is technically viable...|$|R
40|$|Ordered {{mesoporous}} {{materials are}} porous solids with a regular, patterned {{structure composed of}} pores between 2 and 50 nm wide. Such materials have attracted much attention in {{the past twenty years}} because the chemistry of their synthesis allows control of their unique physicochemical properties, which can be tuned for a variety of applications. Generally, ordered mesoporous materials have very high specific surface areas and pore volumes, and offer unique structures that are neither crystalline nor amorphous. The large tunable interface provided by ordered mesoporous solids may be advantageous in applications involving sequestration, separation, or detection of actinides and lanthanides in solution. However, the fundamental chemical interactions of actinides and lanthanides must be understood before applications can be implemented. This dissertation focuses primarily on the fundamental interactions of plutonium with organically modified mesoporous silica, as well as several different porous carbon materials, both untreated and chemically oxidized. The interactions were studied by batch contact, Pu LIII edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and electron microscopy techniques. Some batch sorption experiments were also performed with europium, and to a lesser extent, cerium and zirconium, to complement the plutonium studies. The extensive efforts that were required in the synthesis and characterization of the materials are also discussed. A method for functionalizing mesoporous silica by self assembly and molecular grafting of functional organosilane ligands was optimized for the 2 D-hexagonal ordered mesoporous silica known as SBA- 15 (Santa Barbara amorphous silica). Four different organically-modified silica materials were synthesized and characterized with several techniques. To confirm that covalent bonds were formed between the silane anchor of the ligand and the silica substrate, functionalized silica samples were analyzed with 29 Si nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Infrared spectroscopy was used in combination with 13 C and 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to verify the molecular structures of the ligands after they were synthesized and grafted to the silica. The densities of the functional silane ligands on the silica surface were estimated using thermogravimetric analysis. Batch sorption experiments were conducted with solutions of Pu(IV), Pu(VI), Eu(III), Ce(III), and Zr(IV). The acetamide phosphonate functionalized silica called Ac-Phos-SBA- 15 required more extensive synthesis than the other three functionalized silica materials. Development of functionalized mesoporous silica extractants for actinides is contingent on their synthesis and hydrolytic stability, and these two aspects of the Ac-Phos-SBA- 15 material are discussed. This material showed the highest binding affinity for all of the target ions, and the sorption and desorption of Pu(VI) to Ac-Phos-SBA- 15 was extensively investigated. An experimental Pu uptake capacity of 30 ± 3 mg Pu per g Ac-Phos-SBA- 15 was determined in pH 1. 8 solutions. A combination of density functional theory modeling and experimental X-ray absorption spectroscopy data indicated that a strong 2 : 1 bidentate octahedral complex of PuO 2 2 + is formed with the acetamide phosphonate ligands at the silica surface. Ordered mesoporous carbons are attractive as sorbents because of their extremely high surface areas and large pore volumes, and could be suitable substrates for the development of actinide sensors based on their electrochemical properties. Three different mesoporous carbon materials were synthesized by collaborators to test their application as radionuclide sorbent materials. The first is called CMK (carbons mesostructured by Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), and was synthesized using a hard silica template with 3 D-bicontinuous ordered mesostructure. Highly ordered body-centered cubic mesoporous carbon was synthesized by self-assembly of a phenol resin around a soft polymer template, and this material is known as FDU- 16 (Fudan University). Etching of the silica portion of mesoporous carbon-silica composites created the 2 D-hexagonal mesoporous carbon called C-CS (carbon from carbon-silica nanocomposites) with a bimodal pore size distribution. The as-synthesized nanocast mesoporous carbon in this work is called UN CMK, and the same material after oxidation treatment with nitric acid is called OX CMK. A portion of both FDU- 16 -type and C-CS-type ordered mesoporous carbons were oxidized with acidic ammonium persulfate, which created the oxidized carbon materials called FDU- 16 -COOH and C-CS-COOH, respectively. The mesoporous carbons were characterized by scanning electron microscopy to view their particle sizes and morphologies. Their porosities and structures on the meso-scale were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption isotherms, and small-angle X-ray scattering. The identity and density of functional groups on the different carbon surfaces were investigated using infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, <b>thermogravimetric</b> analysis, and <b>determination</b> of the point-of-zero-charge with the powder addition technique. The porous carbon materials studied present a wide range of particle morphologies, mesostructures, surface areas, pore volumes, and surface chemistries. Batch Pu(VI) sorption and desorption tests in 0. 1 M NaClO 4 solutions ranging from pH 1 to 10 were performed with all six mesoporous carbons, and a commercial amorphous activated carbon powder for comparison. More extensive batch sorption studies were completed with the different carbon samples, mostly in pH 4 NaClO 4 solutions. Plutonium sorption kinetics, uptake capacities, competition with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid in solution, Pu desorption, and effects of ionic strength were examined. Batch Eu(III) sorption studies with C-CS-type carbon and its oxidized counterpart C-CS-COOH were performed to complement the Pu studies, by demonstrating how pristine and highly oxidized ordered mesoporous carbons interact with lanthanide cations. The oxidation state and coordination environment of plutonium sorbed to pristine and oxidized ordered mesoporous carbon surfaces were probed using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Both untreated and oxidized mesoporous carbons demonstrated high affinity for Pu over a wide range of solution pH conditions, and proved to be superior to activated carbon in terms of Pu sorption kinetics and capacities. The 23 -hour Pu uptake capacity of mesoporous carbon materials was measured to be at least 60 ± 5 mg 239 Pu per g carbon, compared to 12 ± 5 mg super> 239 Pu per g activated carbon. The batch and spectroscopic studies with four different mesoporous carbons showed two main Pu sorption mechanisms, depending on the concentration of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface. Analysis of the X-ray absorption near-edge spectra determined that both untreated and oxidized carbons reduce Pu(VI) and Pu(V) to Pu(IV) in solutions with pH 2 - 7. The preferred binding mechanism is complexation by surface groups, which controls the sorption kinetics on a time scale of 0 to 40 minutes. After surface sites are saturated, the uptake is controlled by the formation of PuO 2 colloids, which exhibit a high affinity for mesoporous carbon surfaces. The colloids form when Pu is reduced to Pu(IV) by carbon materials with low concentrations of surface functional groups. Although Pu(V) and (VI) are also reduced at oxidized carbon surfaces, colloid formation is inhibited by surface complexation of Pu. Based on Eu sorption studies, highly oxidized ordered mesoporous carbon is a very effective general scavenger for actinide and lanthanide cations. Pu and Eu uptake by highly oxidized ordered mesoporous carbon appears to be dictated by chemisorption, and the Eu uptake capacity (138 mg/g from pH 4 solution) is higher than those previously reported for several other carbon materials. Pristine ordered mesoporous carbon exhibits a low affinity for Eu(III), but is an excellent sorbent of PuO 2 nanocrystals due to its high surface area, as well as its large pore size relative to activated carbon. The high affinity of mesoporous carbon for Pu, and the spontaneous reduction of Pu(VI) or Pu(V) to Pu(IV) at these carbon surfaces could be valuable for a variety of applications. The plutonium sorbed to mesoporous carbon surfaces could be removed with 1 M HClO 4 or 1 M HCl, yielding solutions of Pu(III). The redox interaction between porous carbons and aqueous Pu was further investigated in batch experiments with acidic solutions. These experiments showed that porous carbons reduce Pu(VI) to Pu(III) in 1 - 1. 5 M HCl or 1 - 1. 5 M HClO 4, and reduce Pu(VI) to Pu(IV) in 1. 3 M HNO 3. The contact time required for complete reduction of Pu generally decreases with higher surface areas, and increases with carbon surface oxidation. The pore size and ordered structure of the carbon had little or no effect on the redox reaction, provided the carbon had a high surface area. As expected, no redox activity was observed with mesoporous silica. It was demonstrated with activated carbon powder that acidic solutions of oxidized Pu can easily be reduced to Pu(III) by being passed through a column packed with porous carbon particles. This is a fast (~ 16 min per mL solution with the column size used in this work) and convenient way to reduce oxidized forms of Pu and dissolve Pu(IV) colloids without changing the solution matrix, adding chemical reagents, or using a potentiostat. This may be useful in a variety of settings, as manipulation and control of the oxidation state of plutonium is applicable to almost all processes involving remediation, separation and chemical purification of plutonium...|$|R
