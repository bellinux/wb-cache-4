5|$|On 5 March, <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb TO {{requested}} {{equipment for}} two companies mobilised in villages around Kupres—Malovan, Rilić and Ravno. The mobilisation {{was motivated by}} poor military intelligence provided by the 30th Partisan Division. It indicated the presence of thousands of HV and Bosnian Croat troops {{in the vicinity of}} Kupres, supported by Leopard 1 tanks drawn from a contingent of approximately 100 Leopards that the JNA believed had been delivered to Croatia. In response, the division was tasked to deploy its elements to Kupres, Ključ, Mrkonjić Grad, Šipovo, Jajce and the Mount Vlašić, take command of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb TO and repel the expected Croatian attack. In order to achieve this, the division mobilised the 1st, 13th and 19th Partisan Brigades—assigning Kupres to the 19th Brigade as its AOR. By 23 March, the brigade received mobilised troops sufficient to set up three companies. Their immediate task was to block the Malovan and Kupreška Vrata mountain passes. The next day, the divisional commander toured the plateau and was informed that <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Croat forces were in control of the villages of Olovo, Osmanlije and Zlosela, in addition to Kupreška Vrata. On 26 March, <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb TO battalion based in Malovan was subordinated to the 19th Partisan Brigade. At this time, both sides had a relatively small portion of their force inside Kupres, while <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Croat TO held the area adjacently surrounding the town. <b>The</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb TO and the JNA completely controlled the areas surrounding <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Croat TO force.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kupres (Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian: Bitka za Kupres) was {{a battle}} of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> War, fought between <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Croat Territorial Defence Force (Teritorijalna obrana – TO) {{supported}} by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) troops {{on one side and}} the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA), augmented by <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb TO on the other at the Kupres Plateau, on 3–11 April 1992. During the fighting on 8 April, <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Croat TO was reorganised as the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO). The objective of the battle was to control the strategic Kupres Plateau, a major supply route.|$|E
5|$|As the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA) {{withdrew from}} Croatia {{following}} the acceptance and start of {{implementation of the}} Vance plan, its 55,000 officers and soldiers born in Bosnia and Herzegovina were transferred to a new Bosnian Serb army, which was later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS). This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February – 1 March 1992 referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This declaration would later be cited by <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serbs as a pretext for <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> War. On 4 April, JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo. At the same time, the JNA and <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb forces clashed with the HVO at the Kupres Plateau, capturing Kupres by 7 April.|$|E

However, the JNA failed to achieve a breakthrough—even with five attack helicopters deployed in support of its advance towards Zlosela and Kupreška Vrata at 1:30 p.m.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 1992, a Bosnian Serb {{state was}} declared, {{ahead of the}} 29 February1 March {{referendum}} on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovinalater cited as a pretext for <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> War). <b>The</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb state was later renamed Republika Srpska. As the JNA withdrew from Croatia it started to transform into a Bosnian Serb army, handing over its weapons, equipment and 55,000 troops. The process was completed in May, when <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb army became the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS). It was faced by the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), established in April, and the Bosnia and Herzegovina TOrenamed the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine – ARBiH) in May. Formal establishment of these forces was preceded by the first armed clashes in the country as <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serbs set up barricades in Sarajevo and elsewhere on 1March and the situation rapidly escalated. Bosnian Serb artillery began shelling Bosanski Brod {{by the end of}} March, and Sarajevo was first shelled on 4April. By the end of 1992, the VRS held 70% of Bosnia and Herzegovina, following a large-scale campaign of conquest and ethnic cleansing backed by military and financial support from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. <b>The</b> <b>Bosnian</b> War gradually evolved into a three-sided conflict. The initial ARBiH–HVO alliance soon deteriorated as the forces became rivals for control of parts of the country. Ethnic tensions escalated from apparently insignificant harassment in July, to an open Croat–Bosniak War by October 1992. <b>The</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Croat authorities, organized in the Herzeg-Bosnia territory, were intent on attaching the region to Croatia.

A Central Intelligence Agency analysis comparing the effects of Operation Deliberate Force, Sana and Maestral 2 on the VRS noted that the NATO campaign did not degrade the combat capability of the VRS as much as was initially assumed, because the airstrikes were never primarily directed at field-deployed units, rather they targeted the command and control infrastructure of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb military. The analysis concluded that, while NATO degraded {{the capabilities of the}} VRS, the final HV, HVO and ARBiH offensives inflicted the most damage. It further noted that those offensives, rather than the NATO bombing, were responsible for bringing <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serbs to the negotiating table and ending the war. Author Robert C. Owen argues that the HV, HVO and ARBiH would not have advanced as rapidly as they did had NATO not intervened and denied the VRS its long-range communications.|$|E
