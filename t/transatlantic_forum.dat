40|$|On {{both sides}} of the Atlantic, recent public debates over energy {{security}} have been characterized by increased nervousness and anxiety. With all the looming talk about gas “wars”, the oil “weapon”, a “race” for resources and the “locking up” of reserves, one would almost forget that international trade of crude oil and natural gas still largely operates within clear and predictable rules, markets and institutions. Looking at this institutional architecture that governs global energy markets surely throws a whole different light on international energy relations. However, switching the geopolitical lens for an institutionalist one is only reassuring up to a point. Indeed, a close examination of the global energy architecture immediately reveals some serious weaknesses and shortcomings. The existing architecture largely took shape in response to the oil shocks of the 1970 s and is utterly outdated. Structural shifts in international energy markets, such as the rise of new oil consumers outside of the West and the broadening of the concept of energy security, have put this global institutional framework under increasing strain. Therefore, a number of voices have called for a fundamental overhaul of the existing global energy architecture. This paper examines the scope for shared views and even joint action by the European Union (EU) and United States (US) in this reform debate. Special attention is given to the <b>transatlantic</b> energy <b>forums</b> that were formed {{in the context of the}} oil shocks of the 1970 s – the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the G 7 /G 8 – to see how they can be updated to the governance challenges and global political order of the twenty-first century...|$|R

The enclosed report {{will serve as a}} blueprint for the Maryland’s youth apprenticeship system, in an effort to engage a new generation of workers and employers in Maryland. The Committee’s charge is {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} existing high school youth apprenticeship programs in the state, other states, and other countries. The Committee is further tasked with reviewing and identifying ways to implement high school youth apprenticeship programs in the State, reviewing and identifying means through which employers and organizations can obtain tax credits, grants, and other subsidies to support establishment and operation of high school youth apprenticeship programs, and setting targets for the number of apprenticeship opportunities for youth that the state should reach over the next three years. The Committee’s work was directed under the leadership of Dr. Arnold Packer, a specialist in labor economics with expertise in national and international apprenticeship systems. The Committee surveyed youth apprenticeship models in other states and countries as presented by Dr. Robert Lerman, founder of the American Institute of Innovative Apprenticeship. The Committee also heard from the Maryland State Department of Education and other State agencies regarding existing state resources and programs that could be leveraged in support a youth apprenticeship program. In addition, Committee members took part in the inaugural <b>Transatlantic</b> Apprenticeship Exchange <b>Forum</b> held in Washington...|$|R
