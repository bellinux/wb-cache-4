5|$|A few lemurs {{have been}} noted to have {{relatively}} large brains. The extinct Hadropithecus was {{as large as a}} large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate a higher level of intelligence. However, despite having a built-in <b>tool</b> <b>in</b> the form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine teachers’ and principals’ attitudes towards the use of digital <b>tools</b> <b>in</b> school and how such <b>tools</b> are {{incorporated}} <b>in</b> their teaching practice. The study looks into the details of what teaching methods are used by the teachers when using digital tools. It also examines the resources available for teachers in order for them to develop their pedagogical skills in the field of digital <b>tools.</b> <b>In</b> this study, qualitative interviews were used as a method. The study shows that the interviewed teachers are both positive and negative to using different kinds of digital <b>tools</b> <b>in</b> their teaching but to different degrees. The interviews with the principals show that their knowledge of digital <b>tools</b> <b>in</b> school is limited. They do not agree whether the municipality has a policy for digital <b>tools</b> <b>in</b> schools. Moreover, and in line with this uncertainty, the interviews reveal that the principles think teachers use digital <b>tools</b> <b>in</b> their teaching, but they have no idea of how much or how teachers use them...|$|R

40|$|There the {{grinding}} processes of tool steels {{and the working}} processes of parts {{with the use of}} <b>tools</b> <b>in</b> the tungstenless steels have been studied. The study purpose is to rise the efficieng of <b>tools</b> <b>in</b> the new tongstenless steels by means of grinding condition optimization. The relation mechanisms between {{the grinding}} process variables, the surface layer quality and the tool reliability have been brought out. The mathematical models and the design programs for the optimization of grinding conditions of <b>tools</b> <b>in</b> the tungstenless steels have been developed. The recommendations about the wheel characteristic choice and about the grinding regime choice for the cutting <b>tools</b> <b>in</b> the tungstenless steels have been given.

5|$|Because DNA {{collects}} mutations over time, {{which are}} then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny. This field of phylogenetics is a powerful <b>tool</b> <b>in</b> evolutionary biology. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations. This {{can be used in}} studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology; For example, DNA evidence is being used to try to identify the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.|$|E
5|$|Food webs {{are often}} limited {{relative}} to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from food web microcosm studies are extrapolated to larger systems. Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which {{can be difficult to}} decipher, or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web. Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable <b>tool</b> <b>in</b> understanding community ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} (GR) is {{a theory}} of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping {{of space and time}} by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential <b>tool</b> <b>in</b> modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.|$|E

5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has developed}} into an essential <b>tool</b> <b>in</b> modern astrophysics. It provides {{the foundation for}} the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where the gravitational effect is so strong that even light cannot escape. Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.|$|E
5|$|Hilbert spaces {{allow for}} many {{elliptic}} partial differential equations to be formulated {{in a similar}} way, and the Lax–Milgram theorem is then a basic <b>tool</b> <b>in</b> their analysis.

5|$|In addition, isotopic {{analysis}} of exposed terrestrial rocks has demonstrated the cosmogenic (cosmic ray) production of 21Ne. This isotope {{is generated by}} spallation reactions on magnesium, sodium, silicon, and aluminium. By analyzing all three isotopes, the cosmogenic component can be resolved from magmatic neon and nucleogenic neon. This suggests that neon will be a useful <b>tool</b> <b>in</b> determining cosmic exposure ages of surface rocks and meteorites.|$|E

5|$|Lactacystin, {{a natural}} product {{synthesized}} by Streptomyces bacteria, {{was the first}} non-peptidic proteasome inhibitor discovered and is widely used as a research <b>tool</b> <b>in</b> biochemistry and cell biology. Lactacystin was licensed to Myogenics/Proscript, which was acquired by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, now part of Takeda Pharmaceuticals. Lactacystin covalently modifies the amino-terminal threonine of catalytic β subunits of the proteasome, particularly the β5 subunit responsible for the proteasome's chymotrypsin-like activity. This discovery helped to establish the proteasome as a mechanistically novel class of protease: an amino-terminal threonine protease.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic <b>tool</b> <b>in</b> clinical poisoning situations or {{to aid in}} the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30mg/l, which equals 200 µmol/L. Levels of 30–300mg/L (200–2000 µmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50–400mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated colorimetric techniques, gas chromatography and liquid chromatography are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.|$|E
