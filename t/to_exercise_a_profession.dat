50|$|Freedom of {{education}} is guaranteed, mentioning in particular the free teaching {{of the arts and}} sciences. General rules {{of education}} are established by law, which also establishes state schools of all branches and grades. The State prescribes examinations for admission to and graduation from the various branches and grades and for qualification <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> <b>profession.</b> Private schools are required to meet the same standards of education and qualifications, while universities and academies can establish their own regulations within the limits of the law. Education is also a right, with a compulsory and free primary education, given for at least eight years. The highest levels of education are also a right for capable and deserving pupils, regardless of their financial status. To this end scholarships, allowances to families and other benefits can be assigned by the State through competitive examinations.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the oldest}} records of {{technological}} studies in Spain is the Royal Academy of Mathematics in Madrid, leaving aside the Quatrivium of arithmetics, geometry, astronomy and music, the four liberal arts, that form {{the base of the}} technical disciplines, which were studied in the monastic and cathedral schools and later in the medieval and renaissance universities. The Royal Academy of Mathematics was created after the idea and personal initiative of King Philip II after his return from a visit to Portugal in 1582, where he realised that the Portuguese cartographers were more advanced than those in Spain. The Academy did not award qualifications that entitled <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> <b>profession.</b> Its prestige was based on the lecturers and subjects taught. Cartographers, pilots, architects and engineers were trained {{in a way that the}} latter two started to gain a certain degree of recognition. In 1643 the Academy was closed down. The second relevant record of technological studies was the Body of Army, Cities, Ports and Frontiers Engineers founded by King Philip V in 1711. This date marked the foundation of the Spanish engineers as an organised profession. In 1716, for their training, the Royal Military School of Mathematics in Barcelona was created, even if it was not opened until 1720 and besides was limited to a strictly military context.|$|E

40|$|The market {{represented}} in the beginning {{the place where the}} product supply and demand met. The relation between the labour force supply and demand represents what is called the labour force market. The labour force market cannot exist outside the legal regulations establishing it and, especially, organizing the relationship between demand and supply. Unfortunately, at present, one can no longer speak of an automatic adjustment being performed between the demand and the supply, the state having the role to strongly intervene on this market, organizing the employees’ professional training and taking measures to encourage employment. By professional training is defined the activity performed by a person prior to his/her employment, for the purpose of gaining general and specialty knowledge, necessary <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> new <b>profession</b> or trade. In Romania, professional training can be achieved in two variants: either through the national educational system, or outside the national educational system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background: Germany’s 16 states {{regulate}} smoking differently within {{health protection}} principles {{laid down in}} the federal law. All state smoke-free laws in Germany have undergone at least one change since taking effect. Methods: We systematically review federal and state laws regulating smoking, as well as petitions, popular initiatives and referenda that aimed at changing statutory smoking bans. Data generated through the systematic review were correlated with state smoking rates. Results: The protection from the dangers of secondhand smoke is the primary motive for smoking bans in Germany. The first smoke-free laws affecting smoking in pubs, restaurants and several other public places were introduced in 2007. In 2008, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ruled in a leading decision on the smoke-free laws of two states that some common smoking ban exemptions of the introduced smoke-free laws violate the basic right <b>to</b> freely <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> <b>profession</b> and mandated revisions.

40|$|The Romanian Constitution {{establishes}} {{that market}} economy in Romania {{is based on}} private property and is developed under the law of supply and demand. As such, the State has the obligation to ensure freedom of trade, protection of fair competition and to create an appropriate framework {{for the use of}} all factors of production. The Constitution also provides that the choice of profession should be free, and that the exercise of this freedom may be limited "only by law", with regard to the right to work. The operative principle in relation to commercial activities is the freedom of trade, according to which anyone is free <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> commercial <b>profession,</b> provided they respect the limitations and the special conditions prescribed by law. As regards the conditions governing the exercise of commercial activities, the law establishes certain conditions on the capacity of individuals to conduct economic activities, also establishing certain incapacities, as well as incompatibilities, forfeitures and bans on making trade. The law sets specific conditions regarding the capacity of individuals to conduct commercial professional activities, but it also establishes some incapacities to provide shelter from adverse consequences to some persons...|$|R
40|$|The {{evidence}} suggests that emotional intelligence and personality traits are important qualities that workers need in order <b>to</b> successfully <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> <b>profession.</b> This article assumes that {{the main purpose of}} universities is to promote employment by providing an education that facilitates the acquisition of abilities, skills, competencies and values. In this study, the emotional intelligence and personality profiles of two groups of Spanish students studying degrees in two different academic disciplines – computer engineering and teacher training – were analysed and compared. In addition, the skills forming part of the emotional intelligence and personality traits required by professionals (computer engineers and teachers) in their work were studied, and the profiles obtained for the students were compared with those identified by the professionals in each field. Results revealed significant differences between the profiles of the two groups of students, with the teacher training students scoring higher on interpersonal skills; differences were also found between professionals and students for most competencies, with professionals in both fields demanding more competencies that those evidenced by graduates. The implications of these results for the incorporation of generic social, emotional and personal competencies into the university curriculum are discussed. This research was funded by the Secretary of State for Research in Spain R&D project I+D PSI 2009 - 12696, entitled: Intellectual, Personal and Socio-emotional Competencies in University Graduate Entry into the Workforce...|$|R

All states but Bavaria and Saarland, whose smoking bans were more and less comprehensive than those judged by the constitutional court, respectively, needed to change the smoking ban exemptions to reconcile their smoke-free laws with the constitution. Direct democracy initiatives to change smoking bans were only successful in Bavaria in 2010, but a total of 15 initiatives by citizens’ or interest groups attempted to influence non-smokers protection legislation through direct democratic procedures. Early ratification of a smoking ban in a federal state correlates with a higher reduction in the smoking rate from 2005 to 2009 (Spearman’s ρ = 0. 51, p = 0. 04). Conclusions: The federal government structure and direct democratic participation in smoke-free legislation in Germany has produced a diversity of local smoking bans and exemptions...|$|R

60|$|November 8th, 1845.--On {{our way to}} take {{an early}} dinner at Foxhow yesterday, we met the Poet {{at the foot of}} his own hill, and he engaged us to go to tea to the Mount on our way home to hear their adventures, he and his Mary having just {{returned}} from a six weeks' wander among their friends. During their absence we always feel that the road between Grasmere and Ambleside is wanting in something, beautiful as it is. We reached the Mount before six, and found dear Mrs. Wordsworth much restored by her tour. She has enjoyed the visit to her kith and kin in Herefordshire extremely, and we had a nice comfortable chat round the fire and the tea-table. After tea, in speaking of the misfortune it was when a young man did not seem more inclined to one profession than another, Wordsworth said that he had always some feeling of indulgence for men at that age who felt such a difficulty. He had himself passed through it, and had incurred the strictures of his friends and relations on this subject. He said that after he had finished his college course, he was in great doubt as to what his future employment should be. He did not feel himself good enough for the Church, he felt that his mind was not properly disciplined for that holy office, and that the struggle between his conscience and his impulses would have made life a torture. He also shrank from the law, although Southey often told him that he was well fitted for the higher parts of the profession. He had studied military history with great interest, and the strategy of war; and he always fancied that he had talents for command; and he at one time thought of a military life, but then he was without connections, and he felt if he were ordered to the West Indies his talents would not save him from the yellow fever, and he gave that up. At this time he had only a hundred a year. Upon this he lived, and travelled, and married, for {{it was not until the}} late Lord Lonsdale came into possession that the money which was due to them was restored. He mentioned this to show how difficult it often was to judge of what was passing in a young man's mind, but he thought that for the generality of men, it was much better that they should be early led <b>to</b> the <b>exercise</b> of <b>a</b> <b>profession</b> of their own choice.|$|R
