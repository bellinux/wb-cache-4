5|$|As {{with many}} urban rivers, the Frome has {{suffered}} from pollution, but several stretches run through parks and reserves that sustain a range of wildlife. The power of the water was harnessed in many watermills and {{the area around the}} river mouth was developed as shipyards by the eighteenth century. As the city of Bristol developed in <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> twentieth century, flooding became a major problem, remedied by the construction of storm drains and diversions.|$|E

5|$|Finds from sites outside England, {{especially}} in France, have in <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> twentieth century {{been referred to}} M. bucklandii. In 2010 Benson considered these as either clearly different or too fragmentary to establish an identity. In 2014, fossils from the Philippines were identified as dinosaurian in nature, and American palaeontologist John J. Flynn suspected that they belonged to Megalosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Much work on hypercomplex {{numbers and}} group {{representations}} {{was carried out}} in <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> early twentieth centuries, but remained disparate. Noether united these results and gave the first general representation theory of groups and algebras. Briefly, Noether subsumed the structure theory of associative algebras and the representation theory of groups into a single arithmetic theory of modules and ideals in rings satisfying ascending chain conditions. This single work by Noether was of fundamental importance for the development of modern algebra.|$|E
5|$|Muller's {{paternal}} {{grandfather was}} a German immigrant to the Netherlands and a Doopsgezind (Mennonite) minister and professor of theology in Amsterdam.

5|$|Narrative {{tales and}} stories {{are most often}} found on papyri, but partial and {{sometimes}} complete texts are found on ostraca.

5|$|Wasps {{have been}} {{modelled}} in jewellery {{since at least}} the nineteenth century, when diamond and emerald wasp brooches were made in gold and silver settings.

Also buried within the chamber were flint tools and small quantities of pottery.|$|E

5|$|Living {{in what is}} now Europe, {{during the}} Jurassic Period (~201 to ~145 million years ago), Megalosaurus may have hunted stegosaurs and sauropods. Repeated {{descriptions}} during <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> early twentieth century of Megalosaurus hunting Iguanodon (another of the earliest dinosaurs named) through the forests that then covered the continent are now known to be inaccurate, because Iguanodon skeletons are found in much younger Early Cretaceous formations. The only specimens belonging to Megalosaurus bucklandii are from the Lower/Middle Bathonian of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire. No material from outside of the Bathonian formations of England can be referred to Megalosaurus. It lived alongside the theropods Cruxicheiros, Iliosuchus and Streptospondylus, and the sauropods Cardiodon, Cetiosaurus, and possibly Cetiosauriscus. The pterosaur Rhamphocephalus, and indeterminate sauropod and ornithopod remains have also been found alongside fossils of Megalosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Scholars face several {{problems}} {{in attempting to}} connect Khaba to royal names known from the Ramesside era (<b>the</b> <b>Nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> Twentieth Dynasties). Unfortunately, these lists offer no clear consensus about the number or names of the kings of the 3rd dynasty. The Abydos king list gives Nebka, Djoser, Teti, Sedjes, and Neferkarê, while the Turin Canon offers Nebka, Djoser, Djoserteti, Hudjefa, and Huni. The kinglist of Saqqara lists Djoser, Djoserteti, Nebkarê, and Huni. The ancient historian Manetho gives nine names: Necheróphes, Tosorthrós, Týreis, Mesôchris, Sôÿphis, Tósertasis, Achês, Sêphuris, and Kerpherês. Egyptologist Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards, for example, identifies Khaba with the Ramesside cartouche name Teti.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> Twentieth Dynasties saw an {{increase}} in the number of burials (both here and in the Valley of the Queens), with Ramesses II and later Ramesses III constructing a massive tomb that was used for the burial of their sons (KV5 and KV3 respectively). There are some kings that are not buried within the valley or whose tomb has not been located: Thutmose II may have been buried in Dra' Abu el-Naga' (although his mummy was in the Deir el-Bahri tomb cache), Smenkhkare's burial has never been located, and Ramesses VIII seems to have been buried elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Pensford was an {{important}} coal mining area during <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> early twentieth centuries when it formed part of the Somerset Coalfield, {{although there are no}} working coal mines today. The line of the now disused Bristol and North Somerset Railway runs south from Bristol crossing over the River Chew on the surviving distinctive Pensford Viaduct and on to Midsomer Norton. The area suffered serious flooding during the storm of 10 July 1968, prompting localised evacuation of populated valley areas in the lower parts of the valley, around Pensford and Keynsham.|$|E
5|$|The monastery {{enjoyed the}} {{patronage}} of hetmans and other benefactors throughout the years. The chief magnet for pilgrims were the relics of Saint Barbara, {{alleged to have}} been brought to Kiev from Constantinople in 1108 by Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych's wife and kept in a silver reliquary donated by Hetman Ivan Mazepa. Although most of the monastery grounds were secularized in the late eighteenth century, as many as 240 monks resided there in <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> twentieth centuries. The monastery served as the residence of the bishop of Chernigov after 1800. A precentor's school was located on the monastery grounds; many prominent composers, such as Kyrylo Stetsenko and Yakiv Yatsynevych, either studied or taught at the school.|$|E

5|$|The name {{derives from}} the British Celtic, meaning 'fair, fine, brisk’. It {{is not to be}} {{confused}} with other rivers in the south west of England with the same name. The historic spelling, Froom, is still sometimes used and this is how the name of the river is pronounced (as in broom). In <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> twentieth century the River Frome became known in East Bristol as the Danny. The derivation of this name is uncertain, some suggest a nickname, taken from the Blue Danube Waltz, others that it was derived from the Australian slang word dunny.|$|E
5|$|The two-story Roman Revival {{building}} of the observatory was designed by architect Willard Smith after the Roman Tower of the Winds in Athens and was built in 1865. It was named after New York City businessman Daniel S. Schanck, who donated {{a large portion of}} the funds to construct and equip the observatory. Outfitted with telescopes, clocks, and other scientific equipment donated to Rutgers, the Schanck Observatory served as the university's first astronomical observatory and was used to provide instruction to its students through <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> early twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|After {{the medieval}} period, the word elf tended to become less common {{throughout}} the Germanic languages, losing out to alternative native terms like zwerc ("dwarf") in German and huldra ("hidden being") in Scandinavian languages, and to loan-words like fairy (borrowed from French {{into all the}} Germanic languages). Still, beliefs in elves persisted in the early modern period, particularly in Scotland and Scandinavia, where elves were thought of as magically powerful people living, usually invisibly, alongside everyday human communities. They continued {{to be associated with}} causing illness and with sexual threats. For example, a number of early modern ballads in the British Isles and Scandinavia, originating in the medieval period, describe elves attempting to seduce or abduct human characters. With urbanisation and industrialisation in <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> twentieth centuries, beliefs in elves declined rapidly (though Iceland has some claim to continued popular belief in elves). However, from the early modern period onwards, elves started to be prominent in the literature and art of educated elites. These literary elves were imagined as small, impish beings, with Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream being a key development of this idea. In the eighteenth century, German Romanticist writers were influenced by this notion of the elf, and reimported the English word elf into the German language.|$|E
