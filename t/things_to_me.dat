5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important <b>things,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> that could be ever.|$|E
500|$|Timberlake and Scott Storch wrote [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] with Timbaland, who {{produced}} the song. Storch found working with Timberlake easy {{because of the}} song's meaning. Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's romantic relationship with American recording artist Britney Spears, which ended in 2002. Timberlake told MTV News, [...] "I'm not going to specifically say if any song is about anybody. I will say writing a couple of songs on the record helped me deal {{with a couple of}} <b>things.</b> <b>To</b> <b>me</b> songs are songs. They can stem from things that completely happened to you personally or they can stem from ideas that you think could happen to you." [...] In December 2011, Timberlake admitted that he had written [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] after an argument with Spears: [...] "I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call. I walked into the studio and he [...] could tell I was visibly angry." [...] Timbaland recalled, [...] "I was like, 'Man, don't worry about it' and he was like, 'I can't believe she did that to me' and he was like, 'You were my sun, you were my earth'".|$|E
2500|$|In a 2016 article, {{author and}} {{journalist}} Cathy Young described a [...] "current cycle of misandry" [...] in feminism. This cycle, she explains, includes {{the use of}} the term [...] "mansplaining" [...] and other neologisms using [...] "man" [...] as a derogatory prefix. The term [...] "mansplaining," [...] according to feminist writer Rebecca Solnit, was coined soon after the appearance in 2008 of her essay Men Explain <b>Things</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{neologism}} mansplaining {{showed up}} simultaneously in multiple places, so its origin {{is difficult to}} establish. In an essay titled Men Explain <b>Things</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me,</b> Solnit told an anecdote about a man at a party {{who said he had}} heard she had written some books. She began to talk about her most recent book at the time, on Eadweard Muybridge, whereupon the man cut her off and asked if she had [...] "heard about the very important Muybridge book that came out this year" [...] – not considering that it might be (as, in fact, it was) Solnit's book.|$|E
2500|$|Hilton {{expressed}} {{that his own}} son, Mario Armando Lavandeira III, will likely be bullied as well. Hilton said, [...] "He'll probably be bullied out and about because people might say <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{in front of him}} when we're in public... That's even one of the reasons why, even though his name is Mario, I call him Perez Jr. I want him to have an alter ego as well so when people do say things that are hurtful about his dad or hurtful about him hopefully it won't hurt as much because they don't really know him. Those people know you as Perez Jr. but you're not Perez Jr. so it doesn't matter what they say." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jung's {{assessment}} of Western religion arose both {{from his own}} experiences {{as well as from}} the psychotherapeutic work with his European clients. As a young man he had visions and dreams that were powerful and rich with meaning, yet he clung to Christianity. While he believed that God could [...] "do stupendous <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> things of fire and unearthly light", he was profoundly disappointed by his first communion—in his words, [...] "nothing happened". He saw the same symptoms in his clients, namely, a fascination with the power of the unconscious, coupled with the inadequacy of Western religious symbols and rituals to represent this power. Summing up his analysis of the modern European situation he said: [...] "Our age wants to experience the psyche for itself ... knowledge, instead of faith." ...|$|E

2500|$|Solnit's {{original}} essay went further, {{discussing the}} consequences of this gendered behavior and drawing attention to its effect in creating a conspiracy of silence and disempowerment. Solnit later published Men Explain <b>Things</b> <b>To</b> <b>Me,</b> a collection of seven essays on similar themes. Women, including professionals and experts, are routinely seen or treated as less credible than men, she wrote in the title essay, and their insights or even legal testimony are dismissed unless validated by a man. She argued that this was one symptom of a widespread phenomenon that [...] "keeps women from speaking up and from being heard when they dare; that crushes young women into silence by indicating, the way harassment on the street does, that this is not their world. It trains us in self-doubt and self-limitation just as it exercises men's unsupported overconfidence." ...|$|E
2500|$|The duet {{part was}} {{and still is}} {{performed}} regularly on stage by Meat Loaf with his current featured female vocalist Patti Russo. However, with the passing years and the consequent greater maturity of both singers, their interplay during the coda has gradually taken on ironic overtones, if not overtly comedic ones, which were totally absent from the original album version. For example, in the 2007 show 3 Bats Live, after Russo sings [...] "After a while you'll forget everything, it was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling", Meat Loaf stops the band and asks her (half-sung, half-spoken): [...] "Why do you say this to me? Why do you keep saying these <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> every single night?", and she replies innocently (again half-sung): [...] "It's in the lyrics". More funny exchanges of the same kind occur during their other live duets, such as the famous Bat Out of Hell track [...] "Paradise by the Dashboard Light".|$|E
2500|$|On July 6, 2011, Common {{released}} his first single, titled [...] "Ghetto Dreams", from his next album. A second single,"", {{was released on}} October 4, 2011. On December 20, 2011, Common {{released his}} ninth solo album titled The Dreamer, The Believer. Although he left GOOD Music in 2011, Common was featured on the label's first compilation album, 2012's Cruel Summer. Common released a song entitled [...] "Sweet", from The Dreamer/The Believer, which included lyrics critical of rappers who sing, although this criticism was not aimed specifically at Canadian recording artist Drake. Drake took offense and responded by releasing [...] "Stay Schemin'", a song with Rick Ross and French Montana. Common fans only had to wait two-and-a-half days for him to respond to Drake's diss track. On February 13, 2012, Common commented on the feud by saying [...] "It's over. But {{it was all in}} the art of hip hop. He said some <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so I had to say some things back...I wouldn't say [...] but I know I heard something that I felt was directed to me so I addressed it. That's all. But you know, thank God we were able to move forward from it and all is good." ...|$|E
