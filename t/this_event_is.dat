5|$|IUPAC and UNESCO {{were the}} lead {{organizations}} coordinating events for the International Year of Chemistry, {{which took place}} in 2011. The International Year of Chemistry was originally proposed by IUPAC at the general assembly in Turin, Italy. This motion was adopted by UNESCO at a meeting in 2008. The main objectives of the International Year of Chemistry were to increase public appreciation of chemistry and gain more interest in the world of chemistry. <b>This</b> <b>event</b> <b>is</b> also being held to encourage young people to get involved and contribute to chemistry. A further reason for this event being held is to honour how chemistry has made improvements to everyone's way of life.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, {{while he}} was in command of the Duchess of York, his wife {{suddenly}} died in Toxteth. <b>This</b> <b>event</b> <b>is</b> said to have changed Stuart's demeanour and plunged him into a depression. He never again took time off work and left his children to the sole care and maintenance of his four maiden sisters in England. In 1934 he took over his last and most important seagoing role as Commodore of the CPS fleet and was placed in command of the 42,000-ton liner RMS Empress of Britain on her transatlantic route.|$|E

5|$|Legend relates that in January 1297 François Grimaldi, {{disguised}} as a monk, sought shelter at the castle. On obtaining entry he murdered the guard, whereupon his men appeared and captured the castle. Thus the fortress became the stronghold of the Grimaldi. <b>This</b> <b>event</b> <b>is</b> commemorated by a statue of François Grimaldi in the precincts of the palace (Illustration 6) and {{in the arms of}} the House of Grimaldi where François is depicted wielding a sword while in the garb of a monk (Illustration 2).|$|E
5|$|Mhalsa is {{believed}} to be a combined avatara of Mohini and Parvati. Mhalsa was born as the daughter of a rich merchant in Newase called Tirmarsheth. On the divine orders of Khandoba in a dream to Tirmarsheth, she was married to Khandoba on Pausha Pournima(the full moon day of Hindu calendar month of Paush) in Pali(Pembar). Two shivlingas appeared on this occasion. An annual festival marking <b>this</b> <b>event</b> <b>is</b> celebrated in Pali every Paush Pournima.|$|E
5|$|On 18 December 2009, in São Paulo, Cielo {{broke the}} world record in the 50-metre freestyle, {{with a time of}} 20.91 seconds, at a {{championship}} hosted at Esporte Clube Pinheiros, his club in Brazil and where he had trained since 2003. It was the last official event allowing the use of super-suits in Brazil. A day later, he established the best time in the world, 1:26.12, in the 4×50-metre freestyle.

5|$|A minor {{incident}} in the K'iche' capital Q'umarkaj escalated to have important consequences. A K'iche' soldier tried to seize bread from a Kaqchikel woman who was selling it in the market. The woman refused the soldier and drove him off with a stick. The Kaqchikel demanded {{the execution of the}} K'iche' soldier while the K'iche' nobility demanded the punishment of the Kaqchikel bread seller. When the Kaqchikel lords refused to hand her over, the K'iche' lords sentenced Hun-Toh and Wuqu-Batz' to death against the wishes of the K'iche' king K'iq'ab. King K'iq'ab warned his Kaqchikel friends and advised them to flee Q'umarkaj. On the day 13 Iq' of the Kaqchikel calendar the four lords of the Kaqchikel led their people out of the K'iche' capital to found their own capital at Iximche. The exact year of <b>this</b> <b>event</b> <b>is</b> not known with certainty but {{is believed to have been}} between AD 1470 and 1485, with some scholars, such as Guillemín, preferring 1470. The Kaqchikel abandoned their previous capital Chiavar (speculated to be modern Chichicastenango) because it was too close to Q'umarkaj.|$|E
5|$|Although the Nazis won the {{greatest}} {{share of the}} popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932, they did not have a majority and therefore Hitler led a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and the German National People's Party. Under pressure from politicians, industrialists and the business community, President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933. <b>This</b> <b>event</b> <b>is</b> known as the Machtergreifung ("seizure of power"). In the following months, the NSDAP used a process termed Gleichschaltung ("co-ordination") to rapidly bring all aspects of life under control of the party. All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members. By June 1933, virtually the only organisations not in the control of the NSDAP were the army and the churches.|$|E
5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in <b>this</b> <b>event</b> <b>is</b> absolutely fantastic.|$|E

5|$|In 561, {{the king}} {{now known as}} Sky Witness {{installed}} a ruler {{at the site of}} Los Alacranes. Sky Witness played a major part in the political events of the Maya region. He became the overlord of the city of Caracol, to the south of Naranjo, which had previously been a vassal of Tikal. In 562, according to a damaged text at Caracol, Sky Witness defeated Tikal itself and sacrificed its king Wak Chan K'awiil, thus ending his branch of the royal dynasty at Tikal. This catastrophic defeat began a 130-year hiatus for Tikal, reflecting an extended period of dominance by Calakmul. <b>This</b> <b>event</b> <b>is</b> used as a marker to divide the Early Classic from the Late Classic. Sky Witness is also mentioned at Okop, a site much further north in Quintana Roo. The last reference to Sky Witness occurs at Caracol and is dated to AD 572. The text is damaged but probably records the death of this powerful king.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 {{eruption}} of Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland highlighted {{the impacts of}} volcanic ash fall in modern society and our dependence on the functionality of infrastructure services. During this event the airline industry suffered business interruption losses of €1.5-2.5 billion from the closure of European airspace for six days in April 2010 and subsequent closures into May 2010. Ash fall from <b>this</b> <b>event</b> <b>is</b> also known to have caused local crop losses in agricultural industries, losses in the tourism industry, destruction of roads and bridges in Iceland (in combination with glacial melt water), and costs associated with emergency response and clean-up. However, across Europe there were further losses associated with travel disruption, the insurance industry, the postal service, and imports and exports across Europe and worldwide. These consequences demonstrate the interdependency and diversity of impacts from a single event.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Lithuania between 1219 and 1295 {{concerns}} {{the establishment and}} early history of the first Lithuanian state, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The beginning of the 13th century {{marks the end of}} the prehistory of Lithuania. From this point on the history of Lithuania is recorded in chronicles, treaties, and other written documents. In 1219, 21 Lithuanian dukes signed a peace treaty with Galicia–Volhynia. <b>This</b> <b>event</b> <b>is</b> widely accepted as the first proof that the Baltic tribes were uniting and consolidating. Despite continuous warfare with two Christian orders, the Livonian Order and the Teutonic Knights, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was established and gained some control over the lands of Black Ruthenia, Polatsk, Minsk, and other territories east of modern-day Lithuania that had become weak and vulnerable after the collapse of Kievan Rus'.|$|E

5|$|While Josce {{was absent}} from Ludlow, Gilbert de Lacy {{was able to}} take the castle. Josce laid siege to the castle but was {{unsuccessful}} in his attempt to retake it, and retreated to Lambourn with his military forces. Although the exact date of <b>this</b> <b>event</b> <b>is</b> unknown, it appears to have been some time about 1150 or shortly before. Matilda gave Josce some lands around Lambourn after Ludlow's fall as compensation. Later he was given land in Berkshire by King Henry II (became king in 1154), Matilda's son, as further recompense for the loss of Ludlow. In 1156 Josce held lands in Berkshire, Wiltshire, Hampshire, Devonshire and Somerset. These holdings included the manor of Lambourn, worth £76 in income per year, as well as the manor of Stanton (now known as Stanton Fitzwarren in Wiltshire) in addition to the lands scattered in other counties.|$|E
5|$|Áed Findliath, overking of the Northern Uí Néill against Máel Sechnaill. Máel Sechnaill died in 862 and his lands were split, {{effectively}} {{ending the}} conflict. Following this Amlaíb and his kin warred with several Irish leaders {{in an attempt}} to expand their kingdom's influence. In later years Amlaíb conducted extensive raids in Scotland, though these were interrupted by a war in 868 against his former ally Áed Findliath when several Viking longphorts along the northern coast were razed. Amlaíb disappears from contemporary annals in 871. Later accounts say he returned to Lochlann to aid his father in a war, and the Pictish Chronicle says he died in battle against Constantine I of Scotland. <b>This</b> <b>event</b> <b>is</b> usually dated to 874.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to move city and county {{government}} functions {{out of the state}} capitol, the city purchased a plot of land to build on in 1832. They chose a spot on the edge of De Witt's public square, along Eagle Street at the eastern terminus of Lion Street (later renamed Washington Avenue); the land was bought from St. Peter's Church for $10,295.95 ($ in modern dollars). The design of the new city hall was done by Albany architect Philip Hooker. The cornerstone was laid by Mayor John Townsend amid a Masonic ceremony, however the date of <b>this</b> <b>event</b> <b>is</b> in dispute. The building was completed in 1832 {{at a cost of about}} $92,000 ($ in modern dollars). The new city hall was a Greek Revival structure, built of white marble with an entrance porch supported by four Doric columns. On the roof was a gilded dome. The interior was simple, with little ornamentation, though a full-length statue of Alexander Hamilton stood in the center of the upper hall, between the Court room and the Common Council Chamber. Upon one side of this hall was a bas-relief of DeWitt Clinton, with a view of a primitive canal-boat in the distance, and on the opposite wall was a similar figure of Sir Walter Scott. The building was destroyed by fire on February 10, 1880. Plans for a replacement city hall quickly developed.|$|E
