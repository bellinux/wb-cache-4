5|$|Frank Carter the {{original}} vocalist of Gallows announced in early July 2011 {{that he would}} be leaving Gallows because of differing opinions in writing the band's follow-up album to their second release Grey Britain. His departure was effective on 1 August after the band's final tour dates. Just eight days after Frank's departure, on the 9 August 2011, MacNeil was confirmed as the new Gallows vocalist. MacNeil has stated that the members of Gallows asked him initially out of coincidence that Alexisonfire had disbanded and Gallows needed a new singer. With Frank's departure fans of the band started to believe that he left because he wanted to continue playing heavy music, while the band wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more melodic direction; the band decided to release something to show this as false.|$|E

5|$|The 2000–01 NHL {{season was}} Daniel's {{first season with}} the Canucks. His debut was the team's {{first game of the}} {{campaign}} on 5 October 2000, a 6–3 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. Daniel and Henrik became the fourth pair of twins to have played in the NHL. Three days later, Daniel scored his first career NHL goal against goaltender Dan Cloutier of the Tampa Bay Lightning. Assisted by Henrik, the goal tied the game at 4–4 with 1:13 minutes left <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 5–4 regulation win. On 30 November 2000, he suffered a shoulder injury, sidelining him for four games. During his recovery, he was reprimanded by Canucks Head Coach Marc Crawford, who told him that playing through pain is part of being in the NHL. Later in the season, he missed an additional three games due to a back injury, shortening his rookie season to 75 games. He became the first rookie in 2000–01 to reach 20 goals when he scored on 21 March 2001, in a 1–1 tie against the Columbus Blue Jackets. Finishing the campaign with that goal total, he tied for second among League rookies in scoring with Shane Willis, behind Brad Richards. He also had 14 assists for 34 points in total. Making his Stanley Cup playoff debut against the Colorado Avalanche, Daniel recorded an assist in the opening game of the first-round series, a 5–4 loss for the Canucks. He added his first NHL playoff goal later in the series as the Canucks were eliminated in four-straight games. He and Henrik played primarily on the Canucks' third line. Daniel received one third-place vote from the Professional Hockey Writers' Association for the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL rookie of the year, finishing eighth in award balloting overall.|$|E

25|$|As for WABC, {{which has}} aired Jeopardy! at 7:00 ever since, {{initially}} the same lead-out issues plagued the station. Hollywood Squares saw its ratings decline and was {{dropped by the}} station after its second season in favor of bringing back Entertainment Tonight, after two seasons on WWOR; Squares moved to WPIX, where it remained {{until the end of}} its run in 1989. WABC finally found a permanent partner for Jeopardy! in 1990 when it took over for WCBS as the New York home for Wheel of Fortune. Although it had been a ratings winner for the station since WCBS picked up Wheel, the station decided it wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different direction with its pre-prime time programming (for instance, WCBS picked up Hard Copy to serve as the lead in for Wheel in 1989 and eventually paired it with Entertainment Tonight, once it became available in the fall of 1990).|$|E
25|$|Unperturbed by Piquet's mind games, Mansell went on {{to record}} five Grand Prix wins in 1986 and also {{played a part in}} one of the closest {{finishes}} in Formula One history, finishing second to Ayrton Senna in the Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez by a mere 0.014 seconds (Mansell later jokingly said they should give himself and Senna 7½ points each). The 1986 season was led mostly by Mansell in championship points, and it went down to the wire in Adelaide, Australia for the Australian Grand Prix with Prost, Piquet and Mansell all still in contention for the title. The equation was simple, Prost and Piquet needed to win and have Mansell finish no higher than fourth. After aiming for a third-place finish which would guarantee him the title, Mansell would narrowly miss out on winning it after his left-rear tyre exploded in spectacular fashion on the main straight with only 19 laps of the race <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> 2012 interview for Sky Sports Legends of F1 Mansell revealed that, had he hit the wall rather than wrestling the car safely to a halt in the run-off area {{at the end of the}} straight, the stewards would most likely have red flagged the race. As the race was over two thirds distance, he would have kept his position and won his first F1 world title. Instead Mansell ended the season as runner-up to Alain Prost. His efforts in 1986 led to his being voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.|$|E

500|$|IV, Diamond Rio's fourth album, was {{released}} in 1996. It was the [...] "first country release recorded entirely on a digital console"; specifically, a Fairlight console which recorded the album directly to a hard drive. Produced by DuBois, Clute, and the band itself, it was also their first album not to have Powell as a co-producer. According to DuBois, Powell left this role on good terms, as he [...] "saw a need <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> certain direction, and the guys saw a need <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different direction." [...] Roe thought that the album benefited from a new label policy that allowed label personnel to respond more quickly to pitches from songwriters, specifically recalling to Billboard that the label's head of artists and repertoire (A) recommended the lead single [...] "Walkin' Away" [...] while co-writer Craig Wiseman (who co-wrote [...] "Bubba Hyde") was still recording its demo, and the band was able to record the song in {{the same day that}} the demo was completed. [...] "Walkin' Away" [...] peaked at No.2 on the country charts in early 1996. Three more singles were released from the album: the top 10 hits [...] "That's What I Get for Lovin' You" [...] and [...] "Holdin'" [...] (also written by Wiseman), with the top 20 [...] "It's All in Your Head", co-written by Van Stephenson, in between.

Robbins said the film presented for him [...] "a great opportunity <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different direction. I love doing comedy, but I know I can do other things as well."

Zimmer included several cues from the earlier scores, but explains that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> [...] "completely different direction" [...] for Bane's theme.

Kerrigan's voice also consisted of many grunts, growls and screams, and her unique infested voice was provided by doubling up Campbell's voice. She has also claimed that, were she to pen a StarCraft film or novel, she would rather have Kerrigan's relationship with Jim Raynor—the series' primary male protagonist—portrayed as one of admiration, sacrifice, and [...] "them saving each other's butts" [...] than actual romance due to StarCrafts action-oriented nature. While Campbell expressing interest in returning to voice the character in StarCraft II, and even voiced Kerrigan in the trailer for the game, she confirmed in February 2009 that she would not be reprising the role.

[...] "I considered making the dragon more dragon-like, if you will, in its own society, but I haven't had a chance to explore that. I went with a more human element with Saphira while still trying to get a bit of the magic, the alien, of her race." [...] Paolini made Saphira the [...] "best friend anyone could have: loyal, funny, brave, intelligent, and noble. She transcended that, however, and became her own person, fiercely independent and proud." [...] Saphira's blue tinted vision was in turn inspired by Paolini's own color-blindness.|$|E
