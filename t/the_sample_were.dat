5|$|In 1996, a {{team led}} by David Burney {{collected}} breccias containing remains of bats and other animals from the cave of Anjohibe in northwestern Madagascar. The bats in <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>were</b> described by Karen Samonds (previously Irwin) in her 2006 Ph.D. dissertation and a 2007 paper. She found several living species in addition to two extinct ones that she described as new, Triaenops goodmani and Hipposideros besaoka. At the time, the genus Triaenops was thought to include three species on Madagascar–Triaenops auritus, Triaenops furculus, and Triaenops rufus. Since then, Steven Goodman and Julie Ranivo have discovered that the name rufus is not in fact applicable to the Madagascar species and proposed the name Triaenops menamena for the Madagascan bats previously known as Triaenops rufus.|$|E

Indeed, many members of the sample could not attend college, due to the Great Depression and World War II. Almost half of women in <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>were</b> homemakers for most of their lives. Despite these shortcomings, the data from the sample is often used for studies because there is no other group of people who have been followed for so long.|$|E

The poll showed that 78 percent of the sample said they would vote for Sisi should the presidential elections be held again the next day while 11 percent said they would not. Eighty-nine percent said that there was improvement in the security situation after Sisi's taking office. Seventy-three percent said that fuel has become regularly available since Sisi's election. Meanwhile, 35 percent of respondents believed price controls had improved, while 32 percent believed that they have become worse. Twenty-nine percent of the respondents did not see any change, and three percent were undecided.|$|E

Hipposideros, the genus to which H.besaoka is assigned, contains the living species Hipposideros commersoni from Madagascar, among many others. The specific name besaoka is the Malagasy for [...] "big chin". The material of H.besaoka is from locality TW-10 within the cave and is about 10,000 years old or younger. A cladistic analysis using morphological data suggests that H.besaoka is most closely related to the mainland African H.gigas and H.vittatus, previously included in H.commersoni, and somewhat more distantly to H.commersoni itself.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, {{historian}} Charles F. Bryan, Jr., {{performed a}} demographic {{analysis of a}} random sample of forty-six East Tennessee Convention delegates.

[...] Most of the convention's leaders were attorneys or politicians. [...] Approximately three-fourths of Bryan's sample were over the age of 40, with the oldest being 76 and the youngest 22. [...] Roughly 41% of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>were</b> slaveholders, though most owned fewer than five slaves.

30|$|To {{investigate}} the specificity and adhesion of analyte {{to the surface}} of nanoholes, biotin–streptavidin immunoassay was studied with a nanohole sample in several subsequent steps, and the LSPR spectrum was taken after each step. First, <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> immersed into biotinylated thiol at the concentration of 374 μM in ethanol for 20 h at room temperature to form a self-assembled monolayer of biotin, then <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> rinsed with ethanol and DI water and nitrogen dried. Second, <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> immersed into 1 μM streptavidin in PBS for 20 h at room temperature, dried without rinse. Third, <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> rinsed repeatedly with ethanol, PBS and DI water and nitrogen dried. Fourth, <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> exposed under a UV cleaner for 30 min to break the chemical bond between the thiol and gold, then <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> rinsed with ethanol, PBS and DI water repeatedly and nitrogen dried. Fifthly, <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> incubated with biotinylated thiol in ethanol for 20 h at room temperature again, rinsed and dried.|$|R

2500|$|... 178m2Hf has {{the highest}} {{excitation}} energy of any comparably long-lived isomer. One gram of pure 178m2Hf contains approximately 1330 megajoules of energy, the equivalent in about 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of the explosive TNT. The half-life of 178m2Hf is 31 years or 1 Gs (gigasecond, 1,000,000,000 seconds) so that a gram's natural radioactivity is 1.6 TBq (terabecquerels) or roughly 40 Ci (curies). The activity is in a cascade of penetrating gamma rays, the most energetic of which is 0.574 MeV. Substantial shielding would be needed for human safety if <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>were</b> to be 1 gram of the pure isomer. However, so far the nuclear isomer exists only at low concentrations (<0.1%), within multi-isotopic hafnium. One gram of this material has about 1.33 megajoules of energy, about {{an order of magnitude}} better than compressed hydrogen.|$|E
2500|$|On August 10, 2015, the IC {{inspector}} general said {{that two of}} the 40 emails in <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>were</b> [...] "Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information" [...] and subsequently given classified labels of [...] "TK" [...] (for [...] "Talent Keyhole", indicating material obtained by aerial or space-based imagery sources and NOFORN). One is a discussion of a news article about a U.S. drone strike operation. The second, he said, either referred to classified material or else was [...] "parallel reporting" [...] of open-source intelligence, which would also be classified. Clinton's presidential campaign and the State Department disputed the letter, and questioned whether the emails had been over-classified by an arbitrary process. According to an unnamed source, a secondary review by the CIA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency endorsed the earlier inspectors general findings concluding that the emails (one of which concerned North Korea's nuclear weapons program) were [...] "Top Secret" [...] when received by Clinton through her private server in 2009 and 2011, a conclusion also disputed by the Clinton campaign.|$|E
