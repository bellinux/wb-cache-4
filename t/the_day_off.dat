Gary feels neglected and runs away from home. SpongeBob is shaken from his infatuation with the arrival of Patrick, and cannot find Gary. SpongeBob finds a note saying that Gary has left in search of a new owner. Meanwhile, Gary has wandered into a new city, encountering a gang of snails.

5|$|The promotional {{phase of}} the {{gameplay}} mainly deals with the idol conversing with various other characters and doing events, {{some of which are}} necessary to progress the game. There are also times when the player is given choices that directly affect the idol. Over the course of a conversation, text progression pauses when the player is given multiple responses to choose from. Depending on which choice is made will effect how well or poorly the communication is received, which results in either bad, normal or good memories. A bad memory will decrease an idol's enthusiasm, which is displayed at certain points throughout gameplay by a horizontal bar in the top-left of the lower screen. An idol's enthusiasm ranges from blue to yellow and finally to red as enthusiasm increases. A normal memory will reward the player with a heart point, used later during auditions. A good memory will reward the player with two heart points and increased enthusiasm. If the player chooses to take <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>off,</b> an idol's enthusiasm will automatically increase. Days off also give the idol the chance to either stay at home, or go out into town and meet with other characters. The player can check on days off if there are any presents fans have sent the idols, which contain in-game items.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the Crew Rostering Problem (CRP) in a transit bus company. The CRP attempts {{to obtain a}} sequence of daily journeys for weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays, for a given planning horizon. Any model that represents the problem should consider both operational and labor constraints, such as minimum rest time at home and appropriate <b>days</b> <b>off.</b> In this work the problem is solved as a sequence of assignment problems for the daily journeys. This model builds a rostering as balanced as possible, minimizing the amount of overtime and crew idleness. Starting with the solution provided by the assignment model, a new model is presented in order to include <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>off</b> to <b>the</b> crews. This model assures that each crew has its <b>days</b> <b>off</b> properly assigned, either by <b>the</b> maximum <b>days</b> worked consecutively, or {{in order to have}} a Sunday free each seven weeks. The objective function is to minimize the number of crews covering <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>off</b> for regular crews. The models were tested with real data from two bus companies, and the results were compared with the solutions adopted by the companies. Thus it was possible to verify reductions in the number of crews ranging between 8 % and 54 %, plus reductions of 13 % in the overtime paid by the companies...|$|R
40|$|Background Most {{screening}} colonoscopies require {{patients to}} miss work on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of <b>the</b> procedure. Little {{is known about}} whether patients are taking additional time off from work, {{and the reasons for}} doing so. Aims The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the patterns and reasons for missed work related to screening colonoscopies. Methods All outpatient screening colonoscopy procedures performed at an academic medical center over 6 months were reviewed. Exclusions included procedures performed for other indications, patients age 65 or older, procedures performed on Monday or Friday, and patients who were not working. Patients were interviewed by telephone regarding missed work time and the reasons for doing so. Results Sixty-eight patients met all inclusion criteria. Thirty-four percent missed work on more than <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of <b>the</b> procedure. Thirty-two percent took <b>the</b> <b>day</b> prior <b>off,</b> 10 % took <b>the</b> <b>day</b> after <b>off,</b> and 9 % took both <b>days</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> reason for taking <b>the</b> <b>day</b> before <b>the</b> procedure <b>off</b> was uniformly anticipation of the bowel preparation. Of those who took <b>the</b> <b>day</b> after <b>off,</b> 57 % did so as a precautionary measure after moderate sedation, while 43 % had symptoms...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} coach drivers' {{work stress}} during {{work and in}} the course of recovery from work by measurement of urinary catecholamines and cortisol. METHODS: The urinary excretion rate of adrenaline, noradrenaline, and cortisol of 10 coach drivers was studied during a long distance trip of three days and two consecutive <b>days</b> <b>off.</b> Each driver was asked to provide seven urine samples on <b>the</b> working <b>days</b> and six urine samples on <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> second <b>day</b> <b>off</b> was considered as the baseline. RESULTS: An occupationally induced disturbance of the circadian rhythmicity was found for adrenaline and noradrenaline but not for cortisol. The mean excretion rates of adrenaline on <b>the</b> first working <b>day</b> and most samples on all working days were higher than the baseline. For both adrenaline and noradrenaline the mean excretion rates on <b>the</b> first <b>day</b> <b>off</b> were lower than the baseline. For cortisol, the mean excretion rate on all working days was higher than the baseline. A trend towards accumulation of cortisol excretion from <b>the</b> first working <b>day</b> to <b>the</b> third working <b>day</b> was found. A backward shift in peak concentrations was found for adrenaline and noradrenaline on <b>the</b> second working <b>day,</b> as was a forward shift in peak concentration of cortisol on both <b>days</b> <b>off.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Long distance coach drivers showed occupationally induced reactivity in rates of urinary excretion of adrenaline, noradrenaline, and cortisol. After the outward journey the rates of excretion of catecholamines did not return to baseline values. The course of recovery in adrenaline excretion after the journey showed a new phenomenon, which has been called "fatigue debt". It is recommended that longer resting times in shuttle bus trips and fixed <b>days</b> <b>off</b> after these kind of trips should be planned. Extensive future research should be focused on the additional relations between fatigue debt and health complaint...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies a {{two-phase}} decomposition {{approach to}} solve the personnel scheduling problem. The first phase creates a <b>days</b> <b>off</b> schedule, indicating working <b>days</b> and <b>days</b> <b>off</b> for each employee. The second phase assigns shifts to <b>the</b> working <b>days</b> in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>off</b> schedule. This decomposition is motivated {{by the fact that}} personnel scheduling constraints are often divided in two categories: one specifies constraints on working <b>days</b> and <b>days</b> <b>off,</b> while <b>the</b> other specifies constraints on shift assignments. To assess the consequences of the decomposition approach, we apply it to public benchmark instances, and compare this to solving the personnel scheduling problem directly. In all steps we use mathematical programming. We also study the extension that includes night shifts in thefirst phase of the decomposition. We present a detailed results analysis, and analyze the effect of various instance parameters on the decompositions' results. In general, we observe that the decompositions significantly reduce the computation time, and that they produce good solutions for most instances...|$|R
