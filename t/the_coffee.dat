5|$|In the United States, Rick had a {{temporary}} economic impact when, during its time off {{the shore of}} Chiapas and Oaxaca, it caused the price of coffee to rise 4.7 percent to $1.5685 per pound on <b>the</b> <b>Coffee,</b> Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the highest total it reached since October 16. Mexico is the United States's largest source of coffee imports and Oaxaca and Chiapas are the largest coffee growing regions in Mexico. Like the impact in El Tomatal, Rick's effects were much worse than Pauline's because Rick threatened <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> crop when the beans were more susceptible to winds that could blow them off.|$|E

5|$|Strong winds {{in southwestern}} Haiti from the {{hurricane}} {{damaged or destroyed}} hundreds of trees. The path of Flora over the area was best determined by the trajectory of fallen trees across the peninsula. The strong winds left entire villages roofless, with many buildings entirely destroyed. The combination of rough waves and strong winds destroyed three entire communities. Many {{of those who died}} in southwestern Haiti suffered from intense burns from strong winds. In most areas, crops were entirely destroyed. <b>The</b> <b>coffee</b> crop was harvested prior to the arrival of the hurricane, though heavy rainfall and severe flooding ruined the crop for later years. Additionally, strong winds downed shading trees for <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> crop on the southern peninsula. One official estimated it would require three years for <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> crop to be replanted and regrown.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>coffee</b> {{farmers of}} Maraba first needed a washing station to remove sugar from the coating of <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> bean, under the skin. If this sugar is not removed within 12 hours of picking, the flavour of <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> is impaired. They {{built the first}} station in July 2001 in the Cyarumbo sector, close to the main road, with funding from UNR, the Office des Cultures Industrielles du Rwanda (OCIR-Café), ACDI/VOCA, and the Institut des Sciences Agronomiques du Rwanda (ISAR). The opening {{was late in the}} harvest season, so only 200kilograms (441lb) of that year's harvest were {{suitable}} for washing. However, the results were reasonably good, and the station was upgraded to allow more coffee to be processed in 2002. To bring mineral water from Mount Huye to the upgraded station, ACDI/VOCA helped fund a pipeline, which opened in March 2002.|$|E
5|$|The son of {{the lord}} of Pangala', after Tiku {{captured}} the neighbouring kingdom Baruppu' he became its leader, later ruling Pangala' after his father's death. By exploiting <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> trade and allying with the lowlands Buginese, Tiku was able to obtain large amounts of wealth, land, and power. During <b>the</b> <b>Coffee</b> War (1889–1890), his capital at Tondon was razed by another lord, but retaken the same day. When the Dutch colonials, based in Java, invaded Sulawesi in the early 1900s, Tiku and his soldiers utilised fortresses to withstand and launch attacks. Captured in October 1906, in January 1907 he escaped and remained at large until June. He was executed several days later.|$|E

5|$|As in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, {{the severe}} drought during the El Niño of 1997 {{exacerbated}} the flood's disruption to crops in eastern Cuba. The heavy rainfall from Georges damaged the crops greatly, {{despite the effort}} to harvest them prior to its arrival. Up to 70% of the plantain crop, a chief food in the country's diet, was destroyed. The sugarcane crop fared badly as well, limiting one of the country's important export crops. <b>The</b> <b>coffee</b> and cocoa plantations also suffered from the hurricane, further damaging the country's food supply. A total of 15,758 hectares of croplands as well as 36,040 tons of fruit were destroyed by Hurricane Georges. Agricultural losses from the storm were estimated at $15million.|$|E
