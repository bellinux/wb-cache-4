5|$|The tobacco {{industry}} in North Korea is substantial, with 53,000 hectares (2.3 {{percent of its}} arable land) dedicated <b>to</b> <b>tobacco</b> cultivation. This is the fourth-highest percentage of arable land dedicated <b>to</b> <b>tobacco</b> in the world, with the annual output exceeding 80,000 tonnes, making North Korea {{one of the top}} 25 tobacco worldwide producers. This is despite 31% of North Koreans being malnourished. The best, strongest and most expensive tobacco comes from the north of the country near the border with China.|$|E
5|$|Later in his career, Ford {{split with}} Huddleston's successor, Mitch McConnell, over a {{proposed}} settlement of lawsuits against tobacco companies. Ford favored the package as presented to Congress, {{which would have}} protected the price support program, while McConnell favored a smaller aid package <b>to</b> <b>tobacco</b> farmers {{and an end to}} the price support program. Both proposals were ultimately defeated, and the rift between Ford and McConnell never healed.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{severely}} curtailed {{tobacco production}} {{in favor of}} more sustainable crops, including wheat, corn, rye, and barley. This reduced the soil depletion inherent <b>to</b> <b>tobacco</b> production, and allowed for the practice of crop rotation. He also planted fruit orchards, including peach and apple trees, which he used to produce spirits. In 1801 Richard constructed a dairy, which ran primarily under the supervision of his wife Elizabeth Collins Lee.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review and}} {{critique}} {{the research literature}} on training pediatric residents <b>to</b> address <b>tobacco.</b> METHODS: A Medline search was conducted to identify studies that specifically addressed pediatric residency training on tobacco, and Google Scholar was used to identify articles in which the referenced study was cited. RESULTS: Eight studies that specifically addressed training pediatric residents <b>to</b> intervene on <b>tobacco</b> were identified. Most used active as well as passive approaches to training. Baseline data underscored the importance of training future pediatricians <b>to</b> address <b>tobacco.</b> Although the studies differed in size, scope and rigor, they showed that training pediatric residents <b>to</b> address <b>tobacco</b> enhanced residents' ability and likelihood <b>to</b> address <b>tobacco.</b> CONCLUSION: The review documents the importance and value of training pediatric residents <b>to</b> address <b>tobacco,</b> provides suggestions for future research and underscores the need to incorporate training on tobacco into pediatric residency training curriculum...|$|R
5|$|In Atlantic Canada, Bertha brought strong {{tropical}} storm force winds and heavy rainfall. Two weather stations in Braddeck, Nova Scotia and Hunter's Mountain recorded 7inches (177.8mm) of rainfall. In Prince Edward Island, the storm produced a wind gust of 71mph (115km/h) and 4.72inches (101.6mm) of rain. A weather station in Port-aux-Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador reported a wind gust of 63mph (102km/h) and 2.51inches (50mm) of rain. The high winds brought by Bertha caused moderate damage <b>to</b> <b>tobacco</b> and corn crops in Prince Edward Island and damaged a suspension bridge in Nova Scotia. Heavy rainfall from Bertha caused minimal flooding at a golf course. In Peggys Cove, Nova Scotia, six {{people were injured}} when waves from Bertha washed them into the sea. Damage was estimated at $4.427million (1990CAD, $3.912million 1990USD).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{identified}} adults' {{demographic and}} smoking behavior characteristics {{that are related}} to being asked <b>to</b> provide <b>tobacco</b> <b>to</b> a minor. METHODS: Telephone interviews were conducted with 6352 California adults. Predictors included age, sex, household income, and smoking status. RESULTS: Only 10. 1 % of California adults had been asked <b>to</b> provide <b>tobacco</b> <b>to</b> a minor in the previous year. Fewer than 3 % of individuals 55 years and older had been asked <b>to</b> provide <b>tobacco,</b> but among younger smokers 59. 0 % of 18 - and 19 -year-olds and 39. 3 % of 20 - to 24 -year-olds had been approached. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to reduce the social availability of tobacco are needed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} (i) {{describe}} concurrent and simultaneous tobacco and cannabis use and (ii) investigate {{the association between}} cannabis use and motivation and intentions <b>to</b> quit <b>tobacco</b> {{in a sample of}} socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2013 and 2014 with current tobacco smokers receiving aid from two community service organizations in New South Wales, Australia. At least weekly cannabis use for the month prior to survey, motivation <b>to</b> quit <b>tobacco</b> and intentions <b>to</b> quit <b>tobacco</b> were measured in 369 participants (77 % consent rate). Regressions were carried out to investigate associations between weekly cannabis use and motivation and intentions <b>to</b> quit <b>tobacco.</b> Concurrent tobacco and cannabis use was reported by 19 % (n= 71) of the sample and of these users, 100 % reported simultaneous use. Although regular cannabis use was significantly associated with lower motivation <b>to</b> quit <b>tobacco,</b> it was not significantly associated with intentions <b>to</b> quit <b>tobacco</b> in the next 30 days. Concurrent cannabis use is common in disadvantaged smokers and {{may play a role in}} decreased motivation to quit tobacco; however, it does not appear to be associated with intentions to quit in a sample of disadvantaged smokers...|$|R

25|$|Critics of smoke-free provisions, {{including}} musician Joe Jackson, {{and political}} essayist Christopher Hitchens, {{have claimed that}} regulation efforts are misguided. Typically, such arguments are based upon an interpretation of John Stuart Mill's harm principle which perceives smoke-free laws as an obstacle <b>to</b> <b>tobacco</b> consumption per se, rather than a bar upon harming other people.|$|E
25|$|Smoking {{generally}} has negative health effects, because smoke inhalation inherently poses challenges to various physiologic {{processes such as}} respiration. Diseases related <b>to</b> <b>tobacco</b> smoking {{have been shown to}} kill approximately half of long-term smokers when compared to average mortality rates faced by non-smokers. Smoking caused over five million deaths a year from 1990 to 2015.|$|E

25|$|The first {{successful}} English colony was Jamestown, established May 14, 1607 near Chesapeake Bay.

The colony survived and flourished by turning <b>to</b> <b>tobacco</b> as a cash crop.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{cigarette}} smoking and exposure <b>to</b> <b>tobacco</b> smoke accounts for roughly one in five, {{or at least}} 443,000 premature deaths annually. To put this into context, ABC's Peter Jennings famously reported that in the US alone, tobacco kills the equivalent of three jumbo jets full of people crashing every day, with no survivors. On a worldwide basis, this equates to a single jumbo jet every hour.|$|E
25|$|Cigarettes contain polonium-210, {{originating}} from the decay products of radon, which stick <b>to</b> <b>tobacco</b> leaves. Heavy smoking {{results in a}} radiation dose of 160 mSv/year to localized spots at the bifurcations of segmental bronchi in the lungs from the decay of polonium-210. This dose is not readily comparable to the radiation protection limits, since the latter deal with whole body doses, while the dose from smoking is delivered to a very {{small portion of the}} body.|$|E
