5000|$|A mind meld, first {{depicted}} in the TOS episode [...] "Dagger of the Mind", is a technique for sharing thoughts, experiences, memories, and knowledge with another individual, essentially a limited form of telepathy. It usually requires physical contact with a subject, though instances of mind melds without contact have been seen (for example, in the episode [...] "The Devil in the Dark"). Vulcans can perform mind melds with members of most other species, most notably humans, with Jonathan Archer being the first known human participant in such a ritual in 2154. Even the Earth humpback whale can be successfully melded with. The Ferengi {{are one of the}} few races known to be impervious to the mind meld; mentally disciplined Cardassians may also be resistant to mind melds if properly trained. It is not established if this potential ability is inherent to Cardassians, or if members of any race could be trained to resist a mind meld. Machines, such as the Nomad probe, have been melded with even if only through complete contact.

40|$|The {{connection}} of touch-based pressure or strain sensors and <b>touch-less</b> proximity sensors offers far-reaching possibilities for novel human-machine interfaces. With {{the combination of}} two different sensoric principles, the activation and triggering of functions for the operation of machines can be completely separated from each other, {{in order to avoid}} misuse. Such multifunctional surfaces have been realized with two different classes of smart materials. In a first approach, piezoelectric thin films with high sensitivity for strain have been combined with capacitive proximity sensors. The approach of the hand or of an object and the push onto a surface are detected separately and can therefore trigger different functions. In the second approach, dielectric elastomer sensors for the capacitive detection of pressure or stretch have been connected to proximity sensors. Since for both sensors, identical materials and capacitive measuring techniques are used, a high degree of integration is possible. In this contribution, the two approaches for a combination of touch-based and <b>touch-less</b> sensors are introduced. The problems which have to be solved and solutions for the technical realization of the sensor systems are discussed.
