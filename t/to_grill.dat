25|$|Iowa State is well {{regarded}} for tailgating. The {{layout of}} Jack Trice Stadium on a flood-plain accommodates ample parking space immediately surrounding the stadium.

25|$|Historically, {{the cuisine}} of Estonia has been heavily {{dependent}} on seasons and simple peasant food, which today is influenced by many countries. Today, it includes many typical international foods. The most typical foods in Estonia are black bread, pork, potatoes, and dairy products. Traditionally in summer and spring, Estonians like to eat everything fresh – berries, herbs, vegetables, and everything else that comes straight from the garden. Hunting and fishing have also been very common, although currently hunting and fishing are enjoyed mostly as hobbies. Today, it is also very popular <b>to</b> <b>grill</b> outside in summer.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} Ram Jam {{was started}} by the Alumni Association in 2003 and has grown to become the large pregame football tailgating parties they are today. During the fall semester outside the Legrand Alumni Center, students, alumni, and community members park their cars {{in the parking lot}} and hang out around the center <b>to</b> <b>grill</b> and socialize. The events also feature local bands to provide entertainment, free food and refreshments, bounce houses and other games for kids, and alcoholic beverages for those 21 and up. The Ram Band, the ASU dance team, the Angelettes, and the ASU Cheerleaders also perform and everyone walks over to the stadium prior to the game.|$|E

25|$|The {{cooking time}} depends {{primarily}} on the equipment being used, the amount of sunlight at the time, and the quantity of food {{that needs to be}} cooked. Air temperature, wind, and latitude also affect performance. Food cooks faster in the two hours before and after the local solar noon than it does in either the early morning or the late afternoon. Large quantities of food, and food in large pieces, take longer to cook. As a result, only general figures can be given for cooking time. With a small solar panel cooker, {{it might be possible to}} melt butter in 15 minutes, to bake cookies in 2 hours, and to cook rice for four people in 4 hours. With a high performing parabolic solar cooker, you may be able <b>to</b> <b>grill</b> a steak in minutes. However, depending on local conditions and the solar cooker type, these projects could take half as long, or twice as long.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} meat dishes on Madeira, {{one of the}} most popular being espetada. Espetada is {{traditionally}} made of large chunks of beef rubbed in garlic, salt and bay leaf and marinated for 4 to 6 hours in Madeira wine, red wine vinegar and olive oil then skewered onto a bay laurel stick and left <b>to</b> <b>grill</b> over smouldering wood chips. These are so integral a part of traditional eating habits that a special iron stand is available with a T-shaped end, each branch of the [...] "T" [...] having a slot in the middle to hold a brochette (espeto in Portuguese); a small plate is then placed underneath to collect the juices. The brochettes are very long and have a V-shaped blade in order to pierce the meat more easily. It is usually accompanied with the local bread called bolo do caco.|$|E

60|$|The {{room was}} {{pleasant}} at night. Two tall, dark screens hid the two beds. In front, the piano {{was littered with}} music, the desk littered with papers. Lilly went out on to the landing, and set the chops <b>to</b> <b>grill</b> on the gas stove. Hastily he put a small table on the hearth-rug, spread it with a blue-and-white cloth, set plates and glasses. Aaron did not move. It was not his nature to concern himself with domestic matters--and Lilly did it best alone.|$|E
60|$|So, the {{gridiron}} {{was put in}} requisition, and the good-tempered cherub, who {{was often}} as un-cherubically employed in his own family {{as if he had}} been in the employment of some of the Old Masters, undertook <b>to</b> <b>grill</b> the fowls. Indeed, except in respect of staring about him (a branch of the public service to which the pictorial cherub is much addicted), this domestic cherub discharged as many odd functions as his prototype; with the difference, say, that he performed with a blacking-brush on the family's boots, instead of performing on enormous wind instruments and double-basses, and that he conducted himself with cheerful alacrity to much useful purpose, instead of foreshortening himself in the air with the vaguest intentions.|$|E
60|$|The gun-servers {{stood back}} with the bored {{contempt}} of the professional for the layman who intrudes on his mysteries. Other civilians had come that way before--had seen, and grinned, and complimented and gone their way, leaving the gunners {{high up on the}} bleak hillside <b>to</b> <b>grill</b> or mildew or freeze for weeks and months. Then she spoke. Her voice was higher pitched, it seemed, than ours--with a more shrewish tang to the speeding shell. Her recoil was as swift and as graceful as the shrug of a French-woman's shoulders; the empty case leaped forth and clanged against the trail; the tops of two or three pines fifty yards away nodded knowingly to each other, though there was no wind.|$|E

60|$|The {{place was}} in total darkness, save a red {{glow in the}} chinks and {{ventilators}} of the stove. But now the landlady lit a lamp to see her new guests; I suppose the darkness was what saved us another expulsion; for I cannot say she looked gratified at our appearance. We were in a large bare apartment, adorned with two allegorical prints of Music and Painting, {{and a copy of}} the law against public drunkenness. On one side, {{there was a bit of}} a bar, with some half-a-dozen bottles. Two labourers sat waiting supper, in attitudes of extreme weariness; a plain-looking lass bustled about with a sleepy child of two; and the landlady began to derange the pots upon the stove and set some beefsteak <b>to</b> <b>grill.</b>|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} I reached this conclusion, or inconclusion, {{it was time}} <b>to</b> <b>grill</b> forth to our boat, and we escaped from shade to shade, as before, until we reached the {{first-class}} shelter of the awning at her stern. Even there it was crowded in agonizing disproportion to the small breeze that was crisping {{the surface of the}} solution; and fifteen or twenty babies developed themselves to testify of the English abhorrence of race-suicide among the lower middle classes. They were mostly good, poor things, and evoked no sentiment harsher than pity even when they were not good. Still it was not just the sort of day when one could have wished them given the pleasure of an outing to Greenwich. Perhaps they were only incidentally given it, but it must have been from a specific generosity that several children in arms were fed by their indulgent mothers with large slices of sausage. To be sure they had probably had no whitebait.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Smugwumps were a {{hardy and}} {{intelligent}} race, but they entertained the vain delusion {{that they could}} subdue Nature. Their year was divided into two seasons--summer and winter, the former warm, the latter cold. About {{the beginning of the}} nineteenth century according to my archæthermograph, the summers began to grow shorter and hotter, the winters longer and colder. At every point in their country, and every day in the year, when they had not the hottest weather ever known in that place, they had the coldest. When they were not dying by hundreds from sunstroke they were dying by thousands from frost. But these heroic and devoted people struggled on, believing that they were becoming acclimated faster than the climate was becoming insupportable. Those called away on business were even afflicted with nostalgia, and with a fatal infatuation returned <b>to</b> <b>grill</b> or freeze, according to the season of their arrival. Finally there was no summer at all, though the last flash of heat slew several millions and set most of their cities afire, and winter reigned eternal.|$|E

6000|$|Whether it was {{the strain}} of digging into the {{literature}} of the past every week, or the effort of reading B. Henderson Asher's [...] "Moments of Mirth" [...] is uncertain. At any rate, his duties, combined with the heat of a New York summer, had sapped Mr. Wilberfloss's health {{to such an extent that}} the doctor had ordered him ten weeks' complete rest in the mountains. This Mr. Wilberfloss could, perhaps, have endured, if this had been all. There are worse places than the mountains of America in which to spend ten weeks of the tail-end of summer, when the sun has ceased <b>to</b> <b>grill</b> and the mosquitoes have relaxed their exertions. But it was not all. The doctor, a far-seeing man who went down to first causes, had absolutely declined to consent to Mr. Wilberfloss's suggestion that he should keep in touch with the paper during his vacation. He was adamant. He had seen copies of Cosy Moments once or twice, and he refused to permit a man in the editor's state of health to come in contact with Luella Granville Waterman's [...] "Moments in the Nursery" [...] and B. Henderson Asher's [...] "Moments of Mirth." [...] The medicine-man put his foot down firmly.|$|E
6000|$|Not a word {{occurred}} {{about the}} business of the day. Once, twice, and thrice I tried to slide the subject in, but was discouraged by the stoic apathy of Rufe, and beaten down before the pouring verbiage of his wife. There is nothing of the Indian brave about me, and I began <b>to</b> <b>grill</b> with impatience. At last, like a highway robber, I cornered Hanson, and bade him stand and deliver his business. Thereupon he gravely rose, as though to hint {{that this was not a}} proper place, nor the subject one suitable for squaws, and I, following his example, led him up the plank into our barrack. There he bestowed himself on a box, and unrolled his papers with fastidious deliberation. There were two sheets of note-paper, and an old mining notice, dated May 30th, 1879, part print, part manuscript, and the latter much obliterated by the rains. It was by this identical piece of paper that the mine had been held last year. For thirteen months it had endured the weather and the change of seasons on a cairn behind the shoulder of the cañon; and it was now my business, spreading it before me on the table, and sitting on a valise, to copy its terms with some necessary changes, twice over on the two sheets of note-paper. One was then to be placed on the same cairn--a [...] "mound of rocks" [...] the notice put it; and the other to be lodged for registration.|$|E
