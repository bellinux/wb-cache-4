5|$|Electromagnetic articulography {{uses the}} {{principle}} of electromagnetic induction to measure the position and movement of various points {{in and around the}} mouth. A helmet containing electromagnetic <b>transmitters</b> creates a variable magnetic field by running currents through the <b>transmitters</b> at different frequencies. Sensor coils placed midsagittally in the mouth produce current as they move through the magnetic field inversely proportional to the cube of the distance from the <b>transmitters.</b> The current induced alternates at the same frequency as the transmitter coil and the composite signal can be separated out to determine the distance from each individual coil, thus determining the position of the sensor in space.|$|E

5|$|The Boise Weather Forecast Office {{maintains}} five NOAA Weather Radio <b>transmitters</b> across southwest Idaho {{and southeast}} Oregon. They transmit routine extended and specialized short-term forecasts, current weather observations, hazardous weather outlooks and historical weather information.

50|$|The first <b>transmitter</b> was an UHF RCA TTU1. It was off-the-air {{as much as}} on-the-air {{for many}} years. Problems with air flow, water cooling, old tubes, and {{intermittent}} electronics. This <b>Transmitter</b> was replaced with a used General Electric UHF TT-59a <b>transmitter</b> with klystron power tube.The next <b>transmitter</b> was a used Harris UHF <b>Transmitter,</b> Harris HD-40 Sigma classic with IOT power tube. This <b>transmitter</b> was a laboratory test <b>transmitter</b> at Harris Broadcasting in Quincy Illinois. It was the only sigma at that time constructed in house (the rest came from England). This <b>transmitter</b> was replaced with a Harris DTV sigma CD, IOT power tube <b>transmitter.</b> This latter <b>transmitter</b> is the current <b>transmitter.</b>|$|R
50|$|The term is popularly {{used more}} {{specifically}} {{to refer to}} a broadcast <b>transmitter,</b> a <b>transmitter</b> used in broadcasting, as in FM radio <b>transmitter</b> or television <b>transmitter.</b> This usage typically includes both the <b>transmitter</b> proper, the antenna, and often the building it is housed in.|$|R
50|$|The Riegelsberg <b>Transmitter</b> (or Schocksberg <b>Transmitter)</b> is a <b>transmitter</b> for FM and TV at Riegelsberg, near Saarbrücken, Germany. The <b>transmitter</b> uses as aerial a 287 metre high guyed mast.|$|R
5|$|A simple {{frequency}} allocation {{problem can be}} specified as follows: a number of <b>transmitters</b> in a wireless network must choose a frequency channel on which they will transmit data. To avoid interference, <b>transmitters</b> that are geographically close should use channels with frequencies that are far apart. If this condition is approximated with a single threshold to define 'geographically close' and 'far apart', then a valid channel choice again corresponds to a graph homomorphism. It should go from the graph of <b>transmitters</b> G, with edges between pairs that are geographically close, to the graph of channels H, with edges between channels that are far apart. While this model is rather simplified, it does admit some flexibility: transmitter pairs that are not close but could interfere because of geographical features can added {{to the edges of}} G. Those that do not communicate at the same time can be removed from it. Similarly, channel pairs that are far apart but exhibit harmonic interference can be removed from the edge set of H.|$|E
5|$|Articulographs able {{to measure}} in three {{dimensions}} use six transmitter coils organized in a spherical configuration. The <b>transmitters</b> are arranged so that the axis of a sensor coil is never perpendicular to more than three <b>transmitters.</b> Through the transmitter configuration and ability to measure in multiple dimensions, three-dimensional articulographs {{are able to make}} measurements outside of the midsagittal plane. 2D articulographs require restrictive headmounts to ensure that the subject's head does not move off the plane of measurement. Because 3D articulographs are able to measure outside of the midsagittal plane, a less restrictive headmount is able to be used.|$|E

50|$|In 1936, WHA {{installed}} a custom-built <b>transmitter.</b> In 1951, the station retired this <b>transmitter</b> and purchased a 5,000-watt Westinghouse <b>transmitter.</b> The custom-built <b>transmitter</b> had operated for over 52,000 hours.|$|R
50|$|In 1962 an FM <b>transmitter</b> {{was also}} {{installed}} {{at the site of}} Marnach <b>transmitter.</b> For this <b>transmitter,</b> a further mast was built. In 1965 the transmission power of the mediumwave <b>transmitter</b> was increased to 600 kW and in 1968 to 1200 kW, resulting in Marnach mediumwave <b>transmitter</b> becoming the most powerful privately owned mediumwave <b>transmitter</b> in the world at that time.|$|R
50|$|Stadelheim <b>Transmitter</b> was {{a medium}} wave {{broadcast}} <b>transmitter</b> in Munich-Stadelheim, built in 1926 in the neighbourhood {{of the famous}} Stadelheim Prison. It took up experimental operation on March 1, 1926 and full operation on April 1, 1926. As antenna, this <b>transmitter</b> used a t-antenna hung up on two 100 metre high free standing steel framework towers. The <b>transmitter</b> used a tube <b>transmitter</b> and a machine <b>transmitter</b> from the company C Lorenz AG, the company which made the Lorenz cipher machine. However the machine <b>transmitter</b> had numerous technical problems.|$|R

5|$|The main method {{employed}} by most medium-wave or short-wave pirate stations during the 1960s and 70s involved programming played back on cassette recorders (often {{powered by a}} car battery), with a long wire antenna slung up between two trees. Around this time, VHF/FM <b>transmitters</b> were being built by more adventurous builders. A surge in pirate radio occurred when cheap portable <b>transmitters</b> became available and by the mid-1980s a 50 watt radio transmitter could be obtained for around £200, or could be built for less. The operation of a pirate radio station required a good quality cassette recorder, a transmitter and a high roof, with tower blocks providing the ideal transmission site for pirate radio stations. A 40 watt transmitter broadcasting {{from the roof of}} a fifteen storey tower block could reach a forty-mile radius. Radio shows were often pre-recorded at home, with the pirate radio station operators setting up temporary <b>transmitters</b> on the roof of tower blocks.|$|E

5|$|Sennheiser sound {{equipment}} {{was used for}} the audio. According to Matt Napier, Madonna's monitor engineer, they used Sennheiser's Wireless Systems Manager software to tweak frequencies. Madonna used an HSP 4 headset {{at the beginning of the}} show, later switching to a Sennheiser SKM 5200-II handheld transmitter. Sennheiser <b>transmitters</b> were also used by Minaj, M.I.A. and LMFAO, and Green's microphone used an MD 5235 capsule. Napier said in a Mix article that they needed gold-plated <b>transmitters</b> for Madonna and Green, which were provided by Sennheiser the day of the show. Professional Wireless Systems (PWS), a Masque Sound company, were in charge of wireless sound monitoring; in a series of trial runs, PWS chose a frequency that eliminated interference from other systems.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunications {{in which}} {{multiple}} <b>transmitters</b> and multiple receivers {{have been designed}} to cooperate and to share the same physical channel are called multiplex systems. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed systems are laid out in telecommunication networks, and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.|$|E
5|$|The 1967 Marine Broadcasting Offences Act officially outlawed {{offshore}} stations, but unlicensed radio continued, {{moving from}} ships and sea-based platforms to urban {{areas in the}} latter part of the 1960s (they were already illegal under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949).

5|$|The system, {{then known}} as RDF 1.5, would require {{a large number of}} {{ground-based}} <b>transmitters</b> to work in an operational setting.
