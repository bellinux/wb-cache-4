40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of thermal flutter of open cross section storable tubular extendible member (STEM) spacecraft booms was first observed in OGO IV and subsequently {{on a number}} of other satellites. Theoretical work ultimately ascribed the anomalous, undamped oscillations to the low torsional rigidity of the open section booms. This was confirmed when 'zippered' cross section booms, with substantially higher torsional rigidity, were later flown without exhibiting thermal flutter. However, zippered STEM booms generally have sizeable <b>torsional</b> <b>backlash</b> zones. It is shown here that small amplitude thermoelastic limit cycling within this backlash zone is theoretically possible and is the likely explanation for undamped oscillations recorded on Voyager 1 and 2 {{in the early stages of}} the Voyager mission...|$|E
40|$|A {{calibration}} method for backlash compensation in cylinder worm gears is described which avoids {{the necessity of}} a direct insight into the gear box. The method is based on repeated measurements of the <b>torsional</b> <b>backlash</b> upon purposfully axial shifting of the gearshaft. It is demonstrated that any cylinder worm gear of ideal geometry can be calibrated using a backlash-maximum cirterium. From experimental investigations on gears of real geometry using a cone gear as well as a hypoid gear, a calibration algorithm has been derived. A robot-assisted tool for backlash-oriented calibration has been developed and integrated into an automated cylinder worm gear assembly unit.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology {{for the assessment}} of the NVH (noise vibration and harshness) performance of Dual Clutch Transmissions (DCTs) depending on some transmission design parameters, e. g. <b>torsional</b> <b>backlash</b> in the synchronizers or clutch disc moment of inertia, during low speed maneuvers. A 21 -DOFs nonlinear dynamic model of a C-segment passenger car equipped with a DCT is used to simulate the torsional behavior of the driveline and to estimate the forces at the bearings. The impacts between the teeth of two engaging components, e. g. gears and synchronizers, generate impulses in the forces, thus loading the bearings with force time-history characterized by rich frequency content. A broadband excitation is therefore applied to the gearbox case, generating noise and vibration issues. The metric used to assess the severity of a specific test and to compare, at least qualitatively, the NVH performance related to different design parameters sets, is based on the RMS (root-meansquare) value of each bearing force time-history. Variations from one test to another allow assessing the benefit introduced by specific design parameter modifications. Applications of the proposed methodology aimed at evaluating the effects of reducing the clutch discs moment of inertia, the synchronizers backlash and the internal backlash in the differential are presented. Finally the paper shows that results not only depend on the gearbox design but also on the specific maneuver chosen to excite the dynamic system under test: a clear trend may be seen in some cases while only negligible effects are observed in other condition...|$|E
40|$|In {{industrial}} automation applications, besides adequate motors and robust and “clever” control systems, transmissions play {{a fundamental role in}} achieving precise positioning and high <b>torsional</b> stiffness. Reduced <b>backlash</b> greatly helps both in precise positioning and in motion inversion. Torsional stiffness {{is a valuable}} aid in keeping a fixed position under load. Starting from a cycloid drive presented in a previous paper, a new solution has been developed and experimentally tested. Some numerical analyses as well as the <b>torsional</b> stiffness and <b>backlash</b> experimental measurements are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The angular and radial {{backlashes}} due to intensive wear are {{the most}} distinctive feature of the cold and hot rolling mills drive trains. It causes nonlinear torsional vibration and significant torque amplification. It leads to equipment failures {{but it could be}} used for wear diagnostics in the range of natural frequencies of the drive trains during the transient processes. The static load and dynamic response interrelation, non isochronisms and other nonlinear system features are used for wear diagnostics under the non stationary loads and speeds.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potentiality}} of reducing {{noise and vibration}} of a vehicle transmission thanks to powertrain control integration with active braking. Due to external disturbances, coming from the driver, e. g. during tip-in / tip-out maneuvers, or from the road, e. g. crossing a speed bump or driving on a rough road, the <b>torsional</b> <b>backlashes</b> between transmission rotating components (gears, synchronizers, splines, CV joints), may lead to NVH issues known as clonk. This study initially focuses on the positive effect on transmission NVH performance of a concurrent application of a braking torque at the driving wheels and of an engine torque increase during these maneuvers; then a powertrain/brake integrated control strategy is proposed. The braking system is activated in advance {{with respect to the}} perturbation and it is deactivated immediately after to minimize losses. The powertrain control compensates for the added resistance and reestablishes the vehicle longitudinal performance according to driver's commands. The torsional preload created in the driveline is effective in preventing/reducing vibrations and associated noise. It is worth underlining that the proposed methodology can be directly applied to existing ABS/ESC units, composed of digital solenoid valves, and does not require additional hardware components. The effectiveness of this method has been experimentally validated by means of a Hardware In the Loop (HIL) test bench which includes a Dual Clutch (DCT) transmission and a hydraulic brake system with a customized ABS/ESC unit...|$|R
40|$|The {{precision}} {{control of}} linear feed axes in machine tools is {{examined in this}} thesis. Al¬though high precision in machining has been {{a focal point for}} engineers for over 200 years, the traditional solutions have often been based on complex mechanical designs. In this thesis, two aspects of feed axis controller design are examined: i) the use of appropriate mathematical models and ii) the signiﬁcance of three of the most common performance limiting factors that have traditionally affected precision in linear feed axes. The three particular performance limiting factors considered are: i) dynamic stiffness, ii) torsional vibrations and iii) backlash. The most effective way of obtaining knowledge about a control system is through appro¬priate mathematical modelling. A new two-body model for a simple motor-transmission¬load system is presented in this thesis. This new model is shown to provide a more accurate representation of both the total inertia and lowest natural frequency of a system, when compared with the two-body model that is traditionally used by researchers and system designers. A new model to represent backlash in a two-body system is also pre¬sented. These new models are then extended to provide accurate mathematical models of four common linear feed axis drive conﬁgurations: i) a rotary motor driving a rack and pinion transmission, ii) a rotary motor directly driving a ballscrew transmission, iii) a rotary motor driving a ballscrew transmission via a synchronous belt, and iv) a linear motor directly driving the axis. Different control solutions to the problems of dynamic stiffness, <b>torsional</b> vibrations and <b>backlash</b> are examined in this thesis, with each controller implemented on specially con¬structed test-beds. An approach using Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) is presented xxi for systems with inherently low dynamic stiffness. This QFT approach is shown to pro¬vide a transparent design process, which results in high dynamic stiffness. Different controllers for torsional vibrations are compared both theoretically and experimentally, with many previously published solutions shown to be theoretically equivalent. A new backlash controller is also presented, which is shown experimentally to provide dynamic stability and good tracking performance at both high and low velocities. The importance of treating these performance limiting factors simultaneously is also ad¬dressed in this thesis, with the control solutions developed to address some factors shown to also affect the other factors. The QFT approach is shown to provide a suitable inte¬grated design process, where the implications of any compromises, on the control of each factor, are clearly visible...|$|R
