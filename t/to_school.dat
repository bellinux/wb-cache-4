40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{economic returns}} <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> for China’s Korean {{minority in the}} urban labour market using ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least squares. The OLS estimates of the returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> are similar <b>to</b> findings from recent studies for the Chinese urban labour market. We use father’s education, mother’s education and spouse’s education to instrument for education. The two-stage least squares estimates are considerably higher than the OLS estimates for returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> and slightly higher than existing two-stage least squares estimates of the returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> for the Chinese urban labour market. The two stage least squares estimates of the returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> for the Korean minority living in urban areas are high compared with the Asian average and world average. The economic returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> reported in this study assists to explain why private demand for education among the Korean minority in China is strong and provides a justification for the Korean minority’s focus on educational attainment. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> {{is a fundamental}} parameter of interest in many different areas of economics and public policy. The most common technique for estimating this parameter {{is based on the}} assumption that the ‘true’ coefficient of education in the earnings equation is constant across individuals. However, this may not often be wholly true and returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> estimates may be biased and inconsistent. The objective of this study was to estimate the returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> as a random coefficient and obtain accurate and reliable estimates that will be useful for policy recommendations. The restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method was used to estimate the parameters of a random coefficient model using data from a 2007 / 2008 Ghanaian twins’ survey. The results revealed that the REML {{economic returns}} <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> in three selected cities were between 7 % and 9 %.

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{the first set}} of estimates of the returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> over an extended period in Russia and Ukraine (1985 - 2002). There has been an increase in returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> in both countries but the increase is much bigger in Russia than in Ukraine. The intriguing question is why returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> in Russia and Ukraine diverged so much over the transition period while the skill composition of employment did not. Our approach in analyzing the sources of cross-country differences in returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> is <b>to</b> compare the Mincerian earnings functions between the two countries and then to employ decomposition techniques. Using semiparametric methods, we construct counterfactual wage distributions for university and secondary school graduates for Ukraine using the distributions of Russian characteristics, returns to characteristics, and unobservables. This allows us to decompose differences in returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> between the two countries due to differences in the labor market returns (price effect), differences in unobservables (residual effect), and differences in the labor force composition (composition effect). We conclude that of these three effects the price effect makes a major contribution to the observed differences in the returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling...</b>|$|R
