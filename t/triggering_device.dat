25|$|All seems lost until Independences Armadillo arrives. With A.J. at the controls, {{they reach}} the {{required}} depth for the bomb. However, flying debris from the asteroid damages the <b>triggering</b> <b>device,</b> requiring someone to stay behind to manually detonate the bomb. The crew draw straws and A.J. is selected. As he and Harry exit the airlock, Harry rips off A.J.'s air hose and shoves him back inside, telling him {{that he is the}} son Harry never had and gives his blessing to marry Grace. Harry contacts Grace to bid his final farewell. After some last minute difficulties involving both the shuttle engines and the detonator, the Freedom moves to a safe distance and Harry triggers the detonation while his life flashes before his eyes. The bomb successfully splits the asteroid, avoiding the collision with Earth. Freedom safely returns to Earth, and the surviving crew are treated as heroes. A.J. and Grace get married, with photos of Harry and the other lost crew members present.|$|E
500|$|Normally, {{bombs are}} cheap and fuses are {{relatively}} expensive, but {{an atomic bomb}} is extremely expensive, and any failure of a <b>triggering</b> <b>device</b> is unacceptable. On the other hand, for the same reason, fuses can be employed that would be prohibitively expensive in a conventional bomb. Brode's E-3 group were tasked to develop a fusing mechanism that would have less than one chance in 10,000 of failing to detonate within [...] of the required height. The required height was not initially known, as it depended on the yield, which was uncertain. The group investigated both radar proximity fuses and barometric altimeter fuses. Testing was carried out at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia in August 1943 and Muroc Army Air Field in March 1944 using dummy drops from barrage balloons. In the end, a modified APS-13 Monica tail warning radar known as [...] "Archie" [...] was employed, and the fuses performed flawlessly in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{possible}} to trigger a Thunder-B grenade by a tripwire such as a fishing line tied between its safety pin and a stationary object, provided the grenade is wedged or fastened in place to prevent the tripwire from simply pulling the grenade, and provided the field or event does not forbid such <b>triggered</b> <b>devices.</b> However, {{there are at least}} two main drawbacks to the use of any <b>triggered</b> <b>device</b> or [...] "booby trap" [...] in airsoft. The first disadvantage is that any players who would be eliminated by a <b>triggered</b> <b>device</b> are unlikely to be in sight of a referee or opposing player at the time of the elimination, which creates the distinct possibility that the players will ignore the <b>triggered</b> <b>device</b> and continue dishonestly without honoring the elimination. The other disadvantage of <b>triggered</b> <b>devices</b> is that, on most fields, they are primarily useful in wooded sections where they can be hidden, and the owner of the device is unlikely to be able to locate it after the game in order to retrieve any reusable portion of the device.|$|R

2500|$|The {{trial of}} the Rosenbergs and Sobell began on March 6, 1951, with judge Irving Kaufman presiding. U.S. Attorney Irving Saypol prosecuted for the Southern District of New York. Criminal defense {{attorney}} Emmanuel Bloch represented the Rosenbergs.. The prosecution's primary witness, David Greenglass, stated that he turned over to [...] Julius Rosenberg (his brother-in-law) a sketch of the cross-section of an implosion-type atom bomb (the [...] "Fat Man" [...] bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, {{as opposed to a}} bomb with the [...] "gun method" [...] <b>triggering</b> <b>device</b> as used in the [...] "Little Boy" [...] bomb dropped on Hiroshima). He also testified that his sister Ethel Rosenberg typed notes containing U.S. nuclear secrets in the Rosenberg apartment in September 1945.|$|E
2500|$|After {{hiding out}} {{for nearly a}} week, Duane Peak was arrested for the crime on August 28. [...] In his first {{statement}} to police, without having consulted an attorney, Peak {{said that there was}} an envelope for him at NCCF headquarters on Sunday, August 16. Inside, a note told him to go in back of the Lothrop Drug store and pick up a suitcase, which he did before 5 p.m. He was instructed to take the suitcase to an address near 28th and Ohio at 11 p.m. that night and leave it on the field side of a fence. The note told him to go to a particular payphone before 2 a.m. and wait for a phone call. The phone rang and a woman's voice told him to call 911 and report a woman dragged into 2867 Ohio. The police report indicates that he admitted to placing the 911 call. Peak implicated neither Rice nor Poindexter in his first statement. [...] There are no police reports for August 29 or August 30, so it is unknown who talked to him over the weekend, though in his February 4, 1971 deposition, Peak said that Lt. James Perry interrogated him several times over that weekend. On Monday, August 31, Peak told the County Attorney Art O'Leary in a deposition, that Poindexter had made the bomb at Rice's house, told him to plant it, and then lure the police to the vacant house with an anonymous 911 call. (Peak allegedly carried a suitcase bomb with a clothespin <b>triggering</b> <b>device</b> into three vehicles and to two different residences from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. that day, at one point putting it in the trunk of a car because there were seven passengers in the car including his two small nieces.) ATF Agent Tom Sledge, brother of the Omaha police officer assigned to the call, was present during Peak's deposition, as were two Omaha Police officers, Bill Coleman and Pitmon Foxall and Peak's attorney, Tom Carey, although Peak had to ask the County Attorney who Carey was.|$|E
