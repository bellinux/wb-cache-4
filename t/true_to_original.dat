500|$|Five {{different}} people {{were involved in}} the creation of the film's story and script: executive producer Bob Thompson, original Bionicle co-creators and writers Alastair Swinnerton and Martin Riber Andersen, and Hollywood writers Henry Gilroy and Greg Weisman. The script-writing process began in 2002. Gilroy became involved after a meeting with Thompson, and enjoyed working on the script as he greatly admired the Bionicle mythos. Two draft scripts were originally created to see who would write the better script: one by Swinnerton, and one from Gilroy. Due to time constraints, the Gilroy script was accepted with some of Swinnerton's ideas included. Gilroy's most difficult task was creating the dialogue for the Toa: he needed to take into account Thompson's own interpretations, and what the majority of fans thought they should sounds like. In the end, he attempted to stay <b>true</b> <b>to</b> <b>original</b> portrayals while giving the voice actors something unique to work with. He also needed to balance their portrayals and screentime, as each of the six needed a chance to shine. The script went through eight different drafts before the final version, although this was far less than Gilroy was used to seeing on other projects. During planning stages, a lot of time was devoted to how characters interacted with each other: cited examples were Lewa's style of speaking, and Kopaka's stoic behaviour. These traits were accentuated for the film to give the characters more distinction and depth. He also needed to avoid putting in out-of-context pop culture references, which would not fit into the setting of Bionicle. As part of the world and character development, expressions and exclamations unique to the world were created: a cited example is Jaller saying [...] "You could have been Lava-Bones" [...] when Takua narrowly escapes being killed by a flood of lava.|$|E
2500|$|Conservative Friends (also {{known as}} [...] "Wilburites" [...] after their founder, John Wilbur), {{share some of}} the beliefs of George Fox and the Early Friends. Many Wilburites see {{themselves}} as the Quakers whose beliefs are most <b>true</b> <b>to</b> <b>original</b> Quaker doctrine, arguing that the majority of Friends [...] "broke away" [...] from the Wilburite Quakers in the 19th and 20th centuries (rather than the Wilburites being the [...] "breakaway" [...] sect). Conservative Friends place their trust in the immediate guidance of God. Conservative Friends completely reject all forms of religious symbolism and outward sacraments, such as the Eucharist and water baptism. Conservative Friends do not believe in relying upon the practice of outward rites and sacraments, to have a living relationship with God through Christ; believing that holiness can exist in all of the activities of one's daily life—and that all of life is sacred in God. Many Conservative Friends believe that a meal held with others can become a form of communion with God, and with one another.|$|E

50|$|The {{domestication}} of {{the horse}} resulted in {{a small number of}} domesticated stallions (possibly a single male ancestor) being crossed on wild mares that had adapted to local conditions. This ultimately produced horses of four basic body types, once thought to be wild prototypes, but now considered to be landraces. Many of these animals were then bred <b>true</b> <b>to</b> <b>original</b> type by selected breeding, though emphasizing certain inherent traits (such as a good temperament, suitable to training by humans) to a greater degree than others. In other cases, horses of different body types were cross bred until a desired characteristic was achieved and bred true.|$|E
50|$|Lassus was {{critical}} of the Académie française, which would only recognize pagan Greek and Roman architecture, which he saw as foreign imports.He said of Greek architecture {{that it did not}} suit the French religion or climate, or even the materials available in France.He strongly favored Gothic architecture, a Christian style that had originated in France.He was a purist, would only use historical building materials and tried to remain <b>true</b> <b>to</b> <b>original</b> concepts.He believed that the buildings of the first Gothic period were rational and functional, the peak of French architecture. Later Gothic had degenerated and Renaissance architecture introduced foreign and pagan influences. He considered that restoration of Gothic buildings must respect their formal and structural authenticity.The principles of the first Gothic period would be the basis for a new 19th century architecture.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout the War, as the A-2's {{popularity}} grew, so too did {{the demand}} for it. Only aircrewmen could obtain A-2 jackets through regular channels, although a few celebrated nonflying officers like Gens. MacArthur and Patton and Maj. Glenn Miller also procured and wore them. A small [...] "cottage industry" [...] soon appeared, especially in England, to make A-2-style jackets for GI's (including many airborne infantry troops) who otherwise couldn't get one. This was especially true after the Army stopped purchasing new leather jackets in mid-1943, and disappointed airmen were sent to war in the less desirable cloth jackets, or were unable to replace A-2's they had lost or damaged. As a result, some war-era jackets used by World War II airmen are clearly not <b>true</b> <b>to</b> <b>original</b> AAF specifications, though this makes them no less historic.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new user interface, which allows anyone to easily, {{accurately}} (<b>true</b> <b>to</b> <b>original)</b> and efficiently annotate objects and faces in videos. We identified two key requirements our annotation tool should aim for: accuracy and time efficiency. Accuracy {{is achieved by}} annotating a video as fine-grained as possible. A fine-grained annotation also aids to accurately annotate transient and fast-moving events, such as two objects hitting each other. Since video annotation is very time-consuming, the annotation process should be as efficient as possible in matters of time. We try to increase efficiency by streamlining the annotation process, improving the tool’s usability and extensively using multi-touch gestures. We carry out a user study where we compare the accuracy, efficiency and further aspects of our tool to YouTube. We demonstrate that our tool allows producing more accurate annotations in a smaller amount of time. i Acknowledgements I would like to sincerely thank my supervisor, Victor Lavrenko, for his extensive support and guidance during the project.

40|$|The U. S. and Mexican bishops, {{in their}} {{influential}} pastoral letter Strangers No Longer, frame immigration ethics {{through the lens}} of solidarity with the immigrant. This frame leads them to erroneously interpret the preferential option for the poor and ignore potential harm to poor U. S. citizens caused by recent undocumented immigration from Mexico and other countries. A better framework to immigration ethics is a specified common good approach, which is created in this dissertation. This approach uses the definition of the common good found in Catholic social thought and concretizes it through using a theological anthropology based in Martha Nussbaum 2 ̆ 7 s human functioning capabilities approach and through developing a Common Good Index (CGI). This CGI is a set of twelve sociological indicator, which measures the common good through measuring to what extent basic levels of human capabilities are ensured for all people in society. Using the specified common good approach, the ethical focus becomes more balanced and <b>true</b> <b>to</b> <b>original</b> Catholic intent, attending to the needs of poor U.

The bishops 2 ̆ 7 policy recommendations are affirmed through the specified common good approach, but additional policies are advocated - ones that aim to promote the capabilities of poor U.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{changing}} representations of Jacobinism in England and in France {{during the period}} 1790 - 1792, {{with a view to}} reconsidering the category of “English Jacobin” literature. It argues that Jacobinism has largely been considered {{in the light of the}} Terror in France and the Anti-Jacobin response in England. In the early years of the French Revolution, however, a more nuanced interpretation of Jacobinism is possible, and provides a fruitful way of studying “English Jacobin” authors. While it is important to appreciate the English foundations of Jacobin thought, this thesis addresses a second contributing factor to the concept of “English Jacobinism”: the influence of French Jacobinism itself. The events of the French Revolution, and the constantly changing representations of the Jacobins, demanded a continual renegotiation of the English Jacobins’ relationship with France. This was complicated in two main ways: on the one hand, the conservative backlash against French Jacobins and their “innovating” influence; and on the other hand, the continuation, during the early 1790 s, of correspondence and communication between French and English Jacobins. The sense of a consensus between these groups was complicated by their different political and social origins, and often led the English Jacobins to be misrepresented. This thesis is concerned with both the representation and the reality of English interactions with Jacobinism. By considering the early years of the French Revolution and the formation of Jacobin thought, this study shows that there were certainly shared principles between French and English Jacobins, and that English Jacobins held <b>true</b> <b>to</b> <b>original</b> Jacobin ideology, both in their agitation for political change and in their writing. The thesis concludes with an investigation of how the principle of Jacobin citizenship was developed and explored in literature, and suggests the importance of French Jacobin ideology in understanding English Jacobin literature. ...|$|E
