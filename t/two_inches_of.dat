5|$|The 53rd {{edition of}} the annual Gator Bowl game kicked off on January 1, 1998. An {{estimated}} 54,116 fans were in attendance at the game, which was held in Jacksonville's Alltel Stadium, since renamed Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. The game was televised on NBC, and an estimated 5.1 million Americans watched the broadcast, giving the game a television rating of 3.7, 12th highest of the 21 bowl games that season. Charlie Jones, Bob Trumpy, John Dockery were the sportscasters of the broadcast. During the week prior to the game, the weather had been cold and rainy, with temperatures in the mid-40s and more than <b>two</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> rain. At kickoff, the weather was clear, with temperatures near 55 degrees. North Carolina won the ceremonial pre-game coin toss to determine first possession and elected to play defense to begin the game.|$|E
5|$|To {{control the}} {{movement}} of the hydrogen and air within the envelope, the Patrie was equipped with five valves, some of which operated automatically, and others which could also be operated manually by the pilot via cords. The valves on the gas-bag released hydrogen automatically when the pressure exceeded <b>two</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> water (inAq) (500Pa, 0.723psi); whereas the ballonet valves opened when the air pressure exceeded 0.78inAq (195Pa, 0.282psi), thus ensuring that air was driven out of the ballonet before there was any loss of hydrogen from the gas-bag. The automatic operation of the valves was a factor in the duration of its final (unmanned) flight (see Final flight section below). The pressure in the ballonet was maintained by an engine-driven fan, for which an electrical back-up was provided so that the pressures could be maintained {{in the event of an}} engine failure or when the engine had to be switched off for maintenance purposes.|$|E

25|$|Crickets are {{a common}} subject of children's books on nature and advice on keeping pet crickets are plentiful. An ideal home habitat for a cricket is a large {{transparent}} jar or a small terrarium with at least <b>two</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> damp soil on the bottom. There must be plenty of shelter where the crickets can hide; children's books and industrial breeders recommend egg-crate shells. The top of the terrarium must be tightly covered with a lid or nylon mesh.|$|E
25|$|On July 4, 2007, at 11:00a.m., a 29-year-old female from Fort Wayne, Indiana {{died after}} {{collapsing}} {{near the edge}} of The Wave, falling face-down into <b>two</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> water. Lifeguards immediately responded and pulled her out, then attempted to revive her with help from park medical personnel. Resuscitation attempts continued as the victim was transported by ambulance to Jasper Memorial Hospital, where she died. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be congestive heart failure.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} {{unexpected}} challenges to cope with: In November, 1997, an El Niño weather front dumped <b>two</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> rain in two hours, flooding the NIF site with 200,000 {{gallons of water}} just {{three days before the}} scheduled concrete foundation pour. The earth was so soaked that the framing for the retaining wall sank six inches, forcing the crew to disassemble and reassemble it in order to pour the concrete. Construction was halted in December, 1997, when 16,000-year-old mammoth bones were discovered on the construction site. Paleontologists were called in to remove and preserve the bones, and construction restarted within four days.|$|E

25|$|Modern Western sources {{recommend}} keeping pet crickets in transparent jars {{or small}} terrariums providing at least <b>two</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> soil for burrowing and containing egg-crate shells or similar objects for shelter. A cricket's life span is short: Development from an egg to imago takes {{from one to}} two months. The imago then lives for around one month. Cricket hobbyists have to frequently replace aging insects with younger ones which are either specifically bred for cricket fighting or caught in the wild. This makes crickets less appealing as pets in Western countries. The speed of growth, coupled with the ease of breeding and raising larvae, makes industrial-grown crickets a preferred and inexpensive food source for pet birds, reptiles, and spiders.|$|E

500|$|Fire {{naturally}} occurs after lightning storms, but {{takes its}} heaviest toll when water levels are low. Hardwood hammock and cypress trees {{are susceptible to}} heavy damage from fire, and some may take decades to grow back. Peat built up over centuries in the marsh can cause fires to burn deep scars in the soil. In 2007, Fred Sklar of the South Florida Water Management District said: [...] "An extreme drought can be viewed (as) almost as catastrophic as a volcano. It can reshape the entire landscape. It can take 1,000 years to produce <b>two</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> peat, and you can lose those couple of inches in a week." ...|$|E

500|$|Brunel, who {{prior to}} {{commencement}} of service had substituted a six-bladed [...] "windmill" [...] design {{of his own}} for Smith's proven four-bladed propeller design, now {{decided to try to}} improve the speed by riveting an extra <b>two</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> iron to each propeller blade. On her next crossing to New York, carrying 104 passengers, the ship ran into heavy weather, losing a mast and three propeller blades. After repairs in New York, she set out for Liverpool with only 28 passengers, and lost four propeller blades during the crossing. By this time, another design flaw had become evident. The ship rolled heavily, especially in calm weather without the steadying influence of sail, causing great discomfort to passengers.|$|E
500|$|Suter was {{the third}} member of his family to play defense for the Wisconsin Badgers, {{following}} brothers John and Bob. He appeared in 34 games in 1983–84, scoring 22 points. Ian McKenzie, coordinator of scouting for the Calgary Flames, noticed Suter's play at Wisconsin {{and that he had}} added over <b>two</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> height, which Central Scouting had failed to update in its record on him. The Flames picked Suter with their ninth round selection, 180th overall, in the 1984 Draft. [...] Suter, who had been working in a beer factory, was initially disappointed at his selection. [...] He was in his last year of draft eligibility and was hoping to follow other college players who signed lucrative contracts as free agents after going unselected. Following his sophomore season of 1984–85, in which he recorded 51 points in 39 games for Wisconsin, Suter left Wisconsin to turn professional.|$|E

5|$|Thunderstorms {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Isis dropped more than <b>two</b> <b>inches</b> (50mm) <b>of</b> rainfall across southern Arizona, resulting in some flash flood warnings and flooding on roadways.

2500|$|The {{conditions}} {{that led to}} the extreme weather conditions were caused by a warm front blowing northward from the Azores and an eastward travelling cold front that came together over the British Isles. The first of the severe weather brought heavy rainfall to Northern Ireland on the night of 27 June, with Belfast one of the worst affected areas. <b>Two</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> overnight rain from back building thunderstorms caused flash flooding, damaging properties and leaving 1,000 homes without power for several hours. The following day the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service said that it had dealt with 700 flood-related calls, while Finance Minister Sammy Wilson announced that those affected by the floods would be eligible to apply for up to £1,000 in emergency funding. Northern Ireland Water reported that its staff had helped to clear sewage from 158 properties, and said it was on [...] "high alert" [...] to deal with further incidents.|$|E
