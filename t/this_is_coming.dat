60|$|Let us therefore, {{upon the}} sight of our wretchedness, fly and venturously leap {{into the arms of}} Christ, which are now as open to receive us into his bosom, as they were when nailed to the cross. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> to Christ for life aright; this is right running away from thy master to him, as was said before.

60|$|Let us {{then not}} dare to stop or {{stay in the}} outward court, for there is not this altar. Nor let us dare, when we come into this court, to be {{careless}} whether we look to this altar or no. For it is by blood we must enter; 'for without shedding of blood is no remission.' Let us always then, when we come hither, wash our hands in innocency, and so compass this holy altar: for that by Christ, who is the altar indeed, we are reconciled to God. This is looking to Jesus; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> to God by him, of whom this altar and the sacrifice thereon was a type.|$|E
60|$|And {{where was}} Mary Pratt at {{that day and}} hour when Roswell was thus issuing his last orders at Sealer's Land; and what was her occupation, and what her thoughts? The {{difference}} in longitude between the group and Montauk was so trifling that the hour might be almost called identical. Literally so, it was not; but mainly so, it was. There were not the five degrees in difference that make the twenty minutes in time. More than this we {{are not permitted to}} say on this subject; and this is quite enough to give the navigator a pretty near notion of the position of the group. As a degree of longitude measures less than twenty-eight statute miles at the polar circles, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> within a day's run of the spot, so far as longitude is concerned; and nearer than that we do not intend to carry the over-anxious reader, let his curiosity be as lively as it may.|$|E
60|$|Sir, I have troubled you {{sufficiently}} {{with the}} state of America before the repeal. Now I turn to the honorable gentleman who so stoutly challenges us to tell whether, after the repeal, the provinces were quiet. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> home to the point. Here I meet him directly, and answer most readily, They were quiet. And I, in my turn, challenge him to prove when, and where, and by whom, and in what numbers, and with what violence, the other laws of trade, as gentlemen assert, were violated in consequence of your concession, or that even your other revenue laws were attacked. But I quit the vantage-ground on which I stand, and where I might leave the burden of the proof upon him: I walk down upon the open plain, and undertake to show that they were not only quiet, but showed many unequivocal marks of acknowledgment and gratitude. And to give him every advantage, I select the obnoxious colony of Massachusetts Bay, which at this time (but without hearing her) is so heavily a culprit before Parliament: I will select their proceedings even under circumstances of no small irritation. For, a little imprudently, I must say, Governor Bernard mixed in the administration of the lenitive of the repeal no small acrimony arising from matters of a separate nature. Yet see, Sir, the effect of that lenitive, though mixed with these bitter ingredients,--and how this rugged people can express themselves on a measure of concession.|$|E

5000|$|Ramin Setoodeh of Newsweek {{speculated that}} some of the {{criticism}} for the film is derived possibly from sexism: [...] "when you listen to men talk about it (and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> {{from the perspective of a}} male writer), a strange thing happens.

Men hated the movie before it even opened...Movie critics, an overwhelmingly male demographic, gave it such a nasty tongue lashing you would have thought they were talking about an ex-girlfriend...The movie might not be Citizen Kane—which, for the record, is a dude flick—but its incredibly sweet and touching." ...|$|E

The other band members have also said that the show would be much more laid back and intimate for the fans which would show a different side to Steps. Lisa also said, [...] "We're going to do a mix of the new album and also our classic hits, but I think what we would like to do is to actually have an alternative version with some of them so they're not necessarily the songs as you know them".|$|E
5000|$|In 2015, Jenks sold a spec {{script to}} ABC Studios, titled “Sam”.

And <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> from me, certainly no genius. I haven’t even graduated college”. “Sam” follows a quirky teacher kicked out of several public high schools for eccentric teaching methods, left with one last chance to teach with his best friend at an elite private school in New York City. ABC Family developed the script and passed on the project after the pilot stage. Jenks sold and developed a half hour comedy titled “The Motivational Speaker” to HBO in 2016. The project remains in development with HBO and Pretty Matches, the Sarah Jessica Parker production company.|$|E

5000|$|... 1996 - Zebra River LodgeHercules Viljoen coordinated this {{workshop}} at Zebra River Lodge, a country lodge {{in the south}} of Namibia situated in the beautiful Zebra River Valley. This Tulipamwe, like all the others, had the aim of encouraging the free flow of ideas and information between professional artists from within Namibia and from abroad. This meeting of artistic minds has been described as [...] "an exciting and stimulating experience of personal growth that can not be duplicated other than in a similar workshop situation" [...] by Cathy McRoberts, a Namibian artist in 1996. This workshop inspired one of its participants, Samuel Amunkete, to further his education in the arts. In a similar way the land art, by Eric Pongerard from France-Reunion, inspired many of the Namibian artists to continue in this style, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> out more and more clearly today.|$|E

5000|$|Alice Neiley, also of New York, {{writes the}} following, [...] "electronic music often gathers up so many bells and {{whistles}} in any given composition that the listener can barely find the center, the core mood, the melody, let alone their own center of gravity, or, more frankly, that clear, almost physical reason to keep listening that good music provides every time. Of course, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> from a listener who doesn't usually spend much time with electronic music, so perhaps others would say the opposite. Tim Gemmill, an emerging artist, recently released Road Songs, an unusually solid, soulful album, especially for the electro genre. The tracks move between lengthy, synthesized epics, playful, funk ridden pieces, and pieces rooted in classical themes and West African instrumentation. To say the least, it's eclectic. To say the most, it's a life and all its rhythms, it's a heartbeat." [...] Ms. Neiley concludes, by saying, [...] "Contrary to my initial opinions of electronic music, Tim Gemmill gives the heart a jolt or two, tugging a few strings of longing and sorrow as well. He's obviously trying {{to open up the}} genre with a new wind, and in that endeavor especially, Road Songs is a success—each transition between songs perfectly timed, each shift in heartbeat earned." ...|$|E
