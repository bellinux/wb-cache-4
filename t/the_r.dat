5|$|The {{pre-production}} Griffon I shared <b>the</b> <b>R</b> engine's bore and stroke, but {{was otherwise}} {{a completely new}} design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939. Although this single engine was never flown, the production version, the Griffon II, first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly. A significant difference between <b>the</b> <b>R</b> and the production Griffon was the re-location of the camshaft and supercharger drives {{to the front of}} the engine to reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (<b>the</b> <b>R</b> had two, mounted at the rear), this again was moved {{to the front of the}} engine.|$|E

50|$|Academic {{histories}} in China mentioned <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Lanterns only in passing, {{even after}} 1949, when the Boxer movement {{was considered a}} patriotic uprising of the masses. But suddenly in 1967, <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Lanterns became hot topics in the national media. The Cultural Revolution was at its most radical phase, and the radical student youth groups, <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Guards, reached <b>the</b> heights of their fervor. Like them, <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Lanterns were red, young and rebellious, and one Red Guard group chose the name “Red Lantern Fighting Force.” The Model Revolutionary Opera, <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Lantern, produced by Mao Zedong’s wife, Jiang Qing, had no connection to the Boxer movement, but popularized <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Lantern into a revolutionary symbol. A campaign in official Party newspapers saw a direct connection with <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Lanterns of 1900. Official editorials attacked Liu Shaoqi, Mao’s former second in command, for detesting the Boxers, and called upon <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Guards {{to carry on the}} spirit of <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Lanterns.|$|R

5|$|More {{comparable}} to <b>the</b> <b>R</b> engine was the Fiat AS.6 engine {{developed for the}} 1931 contest; effectively a coupled, double AS.5 that suffered from technical problems. With the assistance of Rod Banks, the AS.6 powered the Macchi M.C.72 to a new speed record for piston-powered seaplanes in 1934 of 440.6mph (709.2km/h), a record that still stands as of 2009.|$|E

5|$|On {{an early}} test run <b>the</b> <b>R</b> engine {{produced}} 1,400hp (1,040kW) and was noted to idle happily at 450revolutions per minute (rpm). With increased boost ratings and fuel developed by Banks, <b>the</b> <b>R</b> engine ultimately developed 2,530hp (1,890kW) at 3,200rpm; well over double the maximum power {{output of the}} Buzzard. The engine was further tested and cleared for limited sprint racing at 2,783hp (2,075kW) at 3,400rpm and +21lb (1.45bar) of boost, but this capability was not used due to concerns with the S.6B's airframe {{not being able to}} withstand the power, and the inability of the aircraft to lift the extra fuel required to meet the increased consumption.|$|E

5|$|The Queens Boulevard line {{is served}} by four {{overlapping}} routes. The E train serves the section between 50th Street and Briarwood, normally running express west of 71st Avenue. The F runs express from 36th Street to 71st Avenue and local east of 71st Avenue. The M and R serve local stops on the route west of 71st Avenue, with the M diverging from the line west of Fifth Avenue/53rd Street and <b>the</b> <b>R</b> splitting west of Queens Plaza. The E and F serve the line at all times, while the M runs on the line during weekdays only and <b>the</b> <b>R</b> runs on the line at all times except late nights. During late nights, the E makes local stops west of Briarwood to provide local service along the line. The routes experience frequent overcrowding during weekdays, and the Queens Boulevard line has among the highest rush-hour train frequencies in the system. A proposed upgrade to the line, to replace its signals with a communications-based train control system, would add capacity to the line.|$|E
