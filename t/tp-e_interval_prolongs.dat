30|$|We {{report that}} {{sevoflurane}} not only caused marked QTc interval prolongation but also increased transmural {{dispersion of repolarization}} in a patient with long QT syndrome 3 (LQT 3). A 16 -year-old male with LQT 3 underwent a shoulder operation. He experienced no episode of syncope or cardiac arrest, but his preoperative electrocardiography (ECG) showed marked QTc interval prolongation (631  ms) and <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> prolongation (126  ms). Anesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with 2 % sevoflurane and remifentanil. Although no lethal arrhythmias occurred in the perioperative period, not only the QTc <b>interval</b> but also <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> was further <b>prolonged</b> by sevoflurane. While sevoflurane has been recognized as a safe anesthetic in terms of QT interval prolongation, even in patients with long QT syndromes, we believe that sevoflurane might be avoided for poorly controlled LQT 3 patients.|$|R
30|$|Sevoflurane {{inhibits}} HERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) currents (IKr), LQT 1 /minK currents (IKs), and Kv 4.3 currents (Ito) [3, 4], and induces significant QT interval prolongation. However, as the prolongation {{is modest}} and sevoflurane {{does not affect}} the <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> in healthy people [5, 6], sevoflurane is generally considered as a safe general anesthetic in terms of TdP and/or lethal arrhythmias, even in those with LQTS [16]. This is probably the first report which clearly demonstrates the <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> prolongation by sevoflurane not only in healthy people but also in patients with LQTS. We think of two reasons why the <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> is <b>prolonged</b> by sevoflurane: The case is a patient with LQTS 3, which is considered to be more dangerous than patients with LQT 1 and LQT 2, or the patient is poorly controlled preoperatively in terms of the QTc and <b>Tp-e</b> <b>intervals.</b> Because LQTS is relatively uncommon (1 in 2500), {{there is a lack of}} a robust evidence based on appropriate perioperative management, and there are few reports which systemically investigate the effect of sevoflurane on the QTc and the <b>Tp-e</b> <b>intervals</b> in LQTS patients. Whyte et al. reported that general anesthesia for LQTS patients was performed 128 of 158 (81 %) with volatile anesthetics including sevoflurane without any serious arrhythmias, such as TdP [17]. However, TdP has been reported to be induced by sevoflurane in some patients, including in a patient with LQT 2 [18], a patient with LQTS who received fluconazole infusion [19], and a patient with poorly controled diabetes [20], because both fluconazole and hyperglycemia inhibit potassium channels (Ikr channels) and induce QT interval prolongation [21, 22]. Furthermore, Kang et al. demonstrated that sevoflurane and DPI 201 - 106, which reduces Na+ channel inactivation and mimicks LQT 3, prolong action potential duration, and the combination of the two drugs has been shown to have an effect on guinea-pig hearts greater than an additive effect of their activities, indicating the potential risk for ventricular arrhythmias when sevoflurane is used for LQT 3 patients [23]. On the other hand, because propofol at clinically relevant concentrations neither affects Ikr [3] nor <b>prolongs</b> QTc <b>interval</b> [5, 6], propofol might have been used in the present patient, rather than sevoflurane.|$|R
40|$|BackgroundType 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) {{is associated with}} increased risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Cardiac electrical inhomogeneity may be {{the leading cause of}} the increased arrhythmic risk in patients with T 2 DM. The peak {{and the end of the}} T wave (<b>Tp-e)</b> <b>interval</b> and associated Tp-e/QT ratio are promising measures of ventricular repolarization indicating transmural dispersion of repolarization. The aim of this study was to assess ventricular repolarization in patients with T 2 DM by using <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval,</b> Tp-e/QT ratio and Tp-e/corrected QT interval (QTc) ratio. MethodsForty-three patients with T 2 DM and 43 healthy control subjects, matched by gender and age, were studied. All participants underwent electrocardiography (ECG) recording. PR, RR and QT intervals represents the ECG intervals. These are not abbreviations. In all literature these ECG intervals are written like in this text. <b>Tp-e</b> <b>intervals</b> were measured from 12 -lead ECG. Rate QTc was calculated by using the Bazett's formula.

30|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that susceptibility to TdP arises from the induction of afterdepolarization and increased dispersion of ventricular repolarization, rather than QT interval prolongation per se [11]. <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> prolongation is now recognized as a good indicator of the risk of TdP, because the <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> is a surrogate of transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) across the myocardial wall [12]. While neither the normal range of <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> nor the indications for the need of correction by heart rate have been defined yet, mean <b>Tp-e</b> <b>intervals</b> in healthy children or adults have been reported to be approximately 65 or 76  ms, respectively [13 – 15].

In 10 pigs, a 56 - electrode sock was placed around the heart, and both stellate ganglia were exposed. Unipolar electrograms, to asses activation recovery interval (ARI) and repolarization time (RT), and 12 -lead ECG were recorded before and during RSGS and LSGS. Both LSGS and RSGS increased dispersion of repolarization; with LSGS, the greatest regional dispersion occurred on the left ventricular (LV) anterior wall and LV apex, whereas with RSGS, the greatest regional dispersion occurred on the right ventricular posterior wall. Baseline, LSGS, and RSGS dispersion correlated with Tp-e. The increase in RT dispersion, which was due {{to an increase in}} ARI dispersion, correlated with the increase in <b>Tp-e</b> <b>intervals</b> (R 2 = 0. 92 LSGS; and R 2 = 0. 96 RSGS). During LSGS, the ARIs and RTs on the lateral and posterior walls were shorter than the anterior LV wall (P < 0. 01) and on the apex versus base (P < 0. 05), explaining the T-wave vector shift posteriorly/ inferiorly. RSGS caused greater ARI and RT shortening on anterior versus lateral or posterior walls (P < 0. 01) and on base versus apex (P < 0. 05), explaining the T-wave vector shift anteriorly/ superiorly.

In 74 patients, the ST-segment, the T-wave, and the QT-interval were analyzed using the MUSE (General Electric HC, Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin) automated system (MUSE). Fifty patients were also analyzed using the Interval Editor automated system (IE; General Electric HC). In 20 patients, measurements were made manually. ResultsTransmural ischemia <b>prolonged</b> the QTc <b>interval</b> (using the Bazett’s formula) in 100 % of patients. In all 74 patients analyzed with MUSE, QTc <b>interval</b> <b>prolonged</b> from 423 ± 25 ms to 455 ± 34 ms (p < 0. 001). In the 50 patients analyzed with IE, QTc <b>interval</b> <b>prolonged</b> in 50 of 50 (100 %) patients (from 424 ± 27 ms to 458 ± 33 ms [p < 0. 001]). Mean time to maximal QTc interval prolongation, changes in T-wave polarity, ≥ 1 mm STE, and ST-segment depression (STD) were 22, 24, 29, and 35 s, respectively. Although QTc <b>interval</b> <b>prolonged</b> in 100 % of patients, T-wave changes, STE, and STD (≥ 1 mm) occurred in 7 %, 15 %, and 7 %, respectively. ConclusionsThe QTc <b>interval</b> <b>prolongs</b> in 100 % of patients with early transmural ischemia.

30|$|The {{management}} {{and treatment of}} patients with LQT 3 differs from those with LQT 1 and LQT 2 due to the differences in pathophysiology. Consequently, anesthetic management of patients with LQT 3 for preventing lethal arrhythmias is also quite different. Unlike LQT 1 and LQT 2, bradycardia is a risk factor of TdP in LQT 3 cases, and β-blockers are not very effective in preventing lethal arrhythmias [1, 2]. Instead, several {{studies have shown that}} mexiletine or flecainide, Na+ channel blockers, significantly shorten the QTc interval [7, 8]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that patients with LQT 3 are more likely to experience lethal arrhythmias than patients with LQT 1 and LQT 2, and the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) is recommended [9, 10]. On the other hand, the present patient was not administered with the above drugs, because he had not experienced any episode of syncope or lethal arrhythmias, such as TdP or VF, and his mother refused such treatment. However, his QTc <b>interval</b> and <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> prolongations were so marked that the doctor in charge tried to persuade the patient to take the drugs, but failed.|$|R

MethodsWe studied 14 patients with nonischemic heart failure who received CRT with a defibrillator, experienced electrical storm and {{were treated with}} intravenous amiodarone. Each patient underwent 12 -lead electrocardiography (ECG) and 187 -channel repolarization interval-difference mapping electrocardiography (187 -ch RIDM-ECG) before and during the intravenous administration of amiodarone infusion. ResultsA recurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia was observed in 2 patients during the early period of intravenous amiodarone therapy. Intravenous amiodarone increased the corrected QT interval (from 470 ± 52 ms to 508 ± 55 ms, P= 0. 003), but it significantly decreased the QT dispersion (from 107 ± 35 ms to 49 ± 27 ms, P= 0. 001), T peak–T end (Tp–e) dispersion (from 86 ± 17 ms to 28 ± 28 ms, P= 0. 001), and maximum inter-lead difference between corrected <b>Tp–e</b> <b>intervals</b> as measured by using the 187 -ch RIDM-ECG (from 83 ± 13 ms to 50 ± 19 ms, P= 0. 001).

40|$|More than 70 drugs {{present on}} the Swiss market can cause drug-induced long QT {{syndrome}} (LQTS), which is associated with torsades de pointes (TdP) arrhythmias, potentially leading to sudden cardiac death. Basic and clinical investigations performed {{during the last decade}} have helped {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms and risk factors of this serious public health problem. In their vast majority, QT <b>interval</b> <b>prolonging</b> drugs block the human ERG (hERG) channel involved in the repolarisation phase of the cardiac action potential, and thus lengthen the QT interval. Beside the well-known QT <b>interval</b> <b>prolonging</b> action of class IA, IC and III anti-arrhythmic drugs, many antibiotics, neurotropic, antifungal, and antimalarial drugs are also able to cause drug-induced LQTS. Reviewing the literature indicates that the risk of QT interval prolongation and TdP is increased in females, in patients with organic heart diseases and hypokalaemia. Furthermore in a few cases, genetic factors have also been reported. However thus far, no genetic test is available to detect at-risk patients, and in consequence, drug prescribers are still relying only on the clinical history and findings to perform an evaluation of the risk. Treatment of drug-induced LQTS and TdP includes identifying and withdrawing the culprit drug(s), infusing magnesium and, in resistant cases acceleration of the heart rate. In this review article we provide a list of QT <b>interval</b> <b>prolonging</b> drugs adapted to the pharmaceuticals found on the Swiss market that can be used as a check-list for drug prescribers and at-risk patients...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesOur {{objective}} {{in this study}} was to evaluate Tpeak-Tend <b>interval</b> (<b>Tp-e)</b> and other electrocardiographic parameters as risk factors for recurrence of life-threatening cardiac events in patients with the Brugada syndrome (BS). BackgroundThe <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> in the electrocardiogram (ECG) has been reported to predict life-threatening arrhythmias in the long QT syndrome. MethodsTwenty-nine patients with the ECG pattern of BS and 29 healthy age- and gender-matched controls were studied. The follow-up period was 42. 65 ± 24. 42 months (range 11 to 108 months). ResultsUpon presentation, five patients had suffered aborted sudden death, five syncope, and two presyncope. Eleven patients with the ECG pattern of BS had a prolonged (> 460 ms) QTc in V 2 but usually not in inferior or left leads. No patient had abnormally prolonged QT dispersion. Programmed electrical stimulation induced ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation in 5 out of 26 patients. Inducibility did not predict recurrence of events. Cardioverter-defibrillators were implanted in 14 patients (all symptomatic and two asymptomatic). During follow-up, nine symptomatic patients experienced recurrences. Previous cardiac events and a QTc > 460 ms in V 2 were significant risk factors (p = 0. 00002 and p = 0. 03, respectively). Tp-e and Tp-e dispersion were significantly prolonged in patients with recurrences versus patients without events (104. 4 and 35. 6 ms vs. 87. 4 and 23. 2 ms; p = 0. 006 and p = 0. 03, respectively) or controls (90. 7 and 17. 9 ms; p = 0. 02 and p = 0. 001, respectively). ConclusionsOur study demonstrates significant correlation between previous events, QTc > 460 ms in V 2, Tp-e, and Tp-e dispersion and occurrence of life-threatening arrhythmic events, suggesting that these parameters may be useful in risk stratification of patients with the Brugada syndrome...|$|R

40|$|Background: Vector-projected 187 -channel electrocardiograms (ECGs) were {{recorded}} in 45 patients with a Brugada-type ECG to evaluate spatial and transmural repolarization and dispersion of action potential duration in Brugada syndrome (BS). Methods: Corrected recovery time (RT-c, R wave peak to the first positive maximum derivative of the T wave with Bazett correction) and RT-c dispersion were calculated. The corrected T peak-end <b>interval</b> (<b>T(p-e)</b> -c, T wave peak {{to the end of}} the T wave with Bazett correction) and T(p-e) -c dispersion were calculated. Results: RT-c dispersion and <b>T(p-e)</b> -c <b>interval</b> were longer in patients with a type 1 ECG, but there was no significant difference in Tp-e dispersion between patients with a type 1 and those with a type 2 / 3 ECG. No significant correlation was noted between RT-c dispersion, T(p-e) -c dispersion, and symptoms. Late potentials (P= 0. 023) and a family history of sudden cardiac death (P= 0. 0017) were correlated with symptoms. Conclusions: Spatial dispersion of repolarization may constitute the electrocardiographic pattern of the Brugada type ECG and conduction disturbance in addition to repolarization abnormality may contribute to the development of malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias...|$|R

The aim of our study was to assess ventricular repolarization in CRF patients receiving hemodialysis, by using QT dispersion, T wave peak to T wave end <b>interval</b> (<b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval),</b> Tp-e/QT ratio, and Tp-e/QTc ratio. Material and Method: Electrocardiogram of 35 CRF patients receiving hemodialysis were studied. T wave peak to end interval, QT and corrected QT intervals and some other ECG intervals were measured. Electrocardiograms of age and sex matched 30 healthy individuals were also analyzed for comparison. Results: CRF group and control group were significantly different from each other for calculated Tp-e (92. 9 ± 24. 7 vs 77. 0 ± 9. 6, p= 0. 002), Tp-e/QTc (0. 20 ± 0. 0 vs 0. 18 ± 0. 0, p= 0. 007), QTd (58. 9 ± 45. 6 vs 27. 3 ± 7. 6, p= 0. 001), and Tp-e/QT (0. 24 ± 0. 1 vs 0. 21 ± 0. 0, p= 0. 034) values. QTc (457. 9 ± 50. 8 e karsi 436. 4 ± 43. 1, p= 0. 077) values were similar in both groups.
