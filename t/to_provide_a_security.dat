These versions can also be useful to develop cryptanalysis techniques. • The IV and the test vectors have been updated. The tweak has essentially no effect on the performances of SIMD.

The resolution was provoked by the persecution of Serbs organized by Ustaše wearing [...] "the fez as a Muslim symbol" [...] and by the consequent respond of Serb Chetniks who persecuted Muslims believing they were responsible for the crimes of Ustaše. The text of this resolution was based on the resolution of the assembly of El-Hidaje (an association of ulama from Bosnia and Herzegovina) held on August 14, 1941. By signing the text of the resolution notable Muslims from Sarajevo condemned the persecutions of the Serbs, distanced from the Muslims who participated in such persecutions and protested against the attempts to blame a whole Muslim population for the crimes of Ustaša. The text of the resolution contained their request to government of the Independent State of Croatia <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>security</b> for the all citizens of country regardless of their identity, to punish those who were responsible for the committed atrocities and to help people who suffered during disorder.

50|$|When the Fall of Bataan {{occurred}} {{as the last}} line of defense was breached by the Japanese forces, droves of American and Filipino soldiers tried to escape capture by any means. Some of these soldiers found their way to Lamao, knowing that boats were located there. During a cargo drop-off, Liwanag noticed a small number of armed and unarmed army soldiers, about a dozen, were trying to board the docked Q-boats which was strictly ordered to carry ammo and supplies only, not indigenous personnel. Without the knowledge that the last battle line had been breached, he threatened many of the soldiers who board any of the Q-boats will be shot. Liwanag escorted the off loaded Q-boats to their supply point. As he returned from the supply trip back to Lamao, his harbor was overwhelmed by a chaotic scene of more panicked troops eager to escape the Japanese advance. He realized the last battle line has finally failed and understood the peril of these men and the danger of his own unit's position. He ordered all Q-boats on dock to dump their cargo and prepare to take on passengers for an immediate evacuation mission. Then he organized the harbor evacuations because the retreating troops were endangering the Q-boats by overloading and capsizing them, at the same time restore some form of order to the chaotic mess. From his dock, he sent out an urgent radio order and a general distress call for more needed boats from across Manila Bay. While all types of civilian boats were volunteering to assist in the evacuation, as more panicked troops kept flooding in. He ordered a number of these troops to create a guard perimeter, which a group of volunteers took the task <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>security</b> buffer outside the dock facilities from enemy incursions while the evacuation took place. As the night fell, the Japanese were slowly closing in, he ordered a number of the waiting troops with demolition skills to assist in preparing the harbor and facilities for destruction by using the ordnance from their last supply run so it wouldn't be useful to the Japanese. They used as much of their harbor's fuel resources to fill the tanks of all the incoming boats and any portable fuel canisters, since Lamao was also a fuel supply depot.|$|E
