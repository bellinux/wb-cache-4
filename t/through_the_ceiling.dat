5|$|Because the liquid-to-gas {{expansion}} ratio of nitrogen is 1:694 at 20°C, {{a tremendous amount}} of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporised in an enclosed space. In an incident on January 12, 2006 at Texas A University, the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed. As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup, the tank failed catastrophically. The force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> immediately above it, shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it, and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1–0.2m off their foundations.|$|E
5|$|Howard gets a {{call from}} her sister, who has {{recently}} found a tumor on her breast. The sister has just learned her husband has been having an affair. Although Howard is initially hesitant to confide in Felton, he eventually surprises her by offering genuine words of comfort. A drunken man dressed as Santa Claus (Cleve Wall) is arrested for threatening his wife and {{a crowd of people}} with a water pistol. Later, the detectives get a call that Santa Claus has escaped from custody in the department, and he is found after falling <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and landing on Munch's desk. Meanwhile, Pembleton and Bayliss discuss the Watson murder scene. Bayliss insists he has already gone over the information repeatedly, but Pembleton tells him he needs to think outside the box and approach it with from the mind-frame of a criminal. Later, Bayliss reexamines the information and realizes the killer brought Watson down a fire escape, offering a new lead in the case. As the new day dawns, Gee has the detectives assemble on the roof so he can spray them with a garden hose to cool them off.|$|E

25|$|The {{caves in}} the Bahamas were formed {{during the last}} ice age. With much of the Earth's water held {{in the form of}} glacial ice, the sea level fell {{hundreds}} of feet, leaving most of the Bahama banks, which are now covered in water, high and dry. Rain falling on the most porous limestone slowly filtered down to sea level forming a lens where it contacted the denser salt water of the ocean permeating the spongy lime stone. The water at the interface was acidic enough to dissolve away the limestone and form the caves. Then, as more ice formed and the sea level dropped even further, the caves became dry and rainwater dripping <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> over thousands of years created the incredible crystal forests of stalagmites which now decorate the caves. Finally, when the ice melted and the sea level rose, the caves were reclaimed by the sea.|$|E

500|$|... "Stress Relief" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Time magazine {{named it}} the best overall television episode of any series in 2009. [...] "Stress Relief" [...] was voted the third highest-rated episode out of 26 from the fifth season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally; the episode was rated 8.89 out of 10. Stanley's heart attack in response to Dwight's fake fire drill ranked number 10 in phillyBurbs.coms top ten moments from the fifth season of The Office. Many critics particularly praised the opening scene, in which Dwight panics his co-workers by simulating a fire. The sequence included scenes such as Kevin looting a vending machine amid the chaos, Oscar's legs crashing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{as he tries to}} crawl out, Angela tossing her cat through an open ceiling tile only for it to fall through another tile, and Andy's reaction to a series of popping caps: [...] "The fire is shooting at us!" ...|$|E

500|$|In summer 2011, a {{piece of}} {{concrete}} fell <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> at a mall restaurant, Hungry Jack's. Reports were filed with the mall manager and the city, with an inspector scheduled to visit two weeks following the incident. The inspector did not show, and mall management did not reply. Hungry Jack's is near to the eventual mall roof collapse. Mall owners continued repair and maintenance work in 2012, spending $120,000 into repairs within the 12-month period leading up to June 2012. An engineering and structural study [...] "turned up nothing", according to the mall manager. Even after the repair, there were photos of serious interior damage to the mall's roof. A local plumber that had done work for the mall suggested there was obvious signs of water damage, eight months before the collapse. In March 2012, the mall management pleaded guilty in provincial court, after their fire alarms and sprinklers did not meet code. The mall spent $50,000 to upgrade the infrastructure to avoid further fines. The process included adding a new roof to the hotel, gutting {{the second and third}} floors, including the hotel lounge.|$|E
500|$|Novice Hame finally {{catches up}} with the Doctor and teleports him against his will to the senate {{building}} where the Face of Boe is waiting.

Those in the Motorway were spared by being sealed in and quarantined, however there was not enough energy to unseal the motorway and as a result caused people to be trapped inside for years. [...] The Face of Boe wired himself to the system to keep the Motorway operational. [...] The Doctor determines that whatever danger that Bliss may have caused before has long passed, and works with Hame to try to power up the systems to unseal the Motorway. [...] The Face of Boe sacrifices his life energy to the system, allowing the ceiling of the Motorway to open. [...] The Doctor broadcasts a call for all drivers to escape <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and gives Martha directions to come find him.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Charles McDougall, his first credit for the series. According to Kinsey, McDougal, in order to set the characters' moods, would start every scene by saying [...] "everyone happy, Angela pissed!" [...] McDougal sought to bring movement to the Secret Santa scene, due to it being a largely stationary sequence. The cold opening was shot four different times, and almost every time, the ceiling tile that Michael displaces with a tree [...] "crashed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and almost killed Steve Carell". The scene wherein Angela starts crying when the Christmas party descends into chaos {{was based on a}} deleted scene from the earlier season two episode [...] "The Fire", where Angela starts crying during a talking head due to the stress of the situation. The scenes featuring snow were created by a company that specialized in producing fake snow. Daniels was initially worried that the shots would look fake, but he was pleased with the final results. According to Fischer, {{on the last day of}} shooting, the cast had a snowball fight—a scene that is included in the episode—which she called a [...] "magic moment". Fischer later recounted that the prop egg nog and pigs in a blanket were kept out for three straight days, an act that she felt was revolting. In order to make her scenes more real Phyllis Smith forced herself to cry for [...] "30 minutes" [...] between takes. Many of the cast members asked her what was wrong, but Smith refused to speak to them, in order to stay in character. The series' writers researched local Pennsylvania laws and discovered one that states a liquor salesman must wear a tie. Thus, the show features a liquor store worker wearing a tie. Several of the scenes were improvised on the spot. During the sequence where Angela angrily throws Christmas bulbs at a wall, Angela Kinsey was unable to get them to break, so she decided to stomp on them. Kate Flannery improvised her line about not drinking only during the week while she was filming her talking head.|$|E

500|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the disturbance, which spread to Newgate Prison next door and continued into the night, Sheppard escaped for the fourth time. [...] He unlocked his handcuffs and removed the chains. [...] Still encumbered by his leg irons, he attempted to climb up the chimney, but his path was blocked by an iron bar set into the brickwork. [...] He removed the bar {{and used it to}} break <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> into the [...] "Red Room" [...] above the [...] "Castle", a room which had last been used some seven years before to confine aristocratic Jacobite prisoners after the Battle of Preston. [...] Still wearing his leg irons as night fell, he then broke through six barred doors into the prison chapel, then to the roof of Newgate, 60feet (20m) above the ground. [...] He went back down to his cell to get a blanket, then back to the roof of the prison, and used the blanket to reach the roof of an adjacent house, owned by William Bird, a turner. [...] He broke into Bird's house, and went down the stairs and out into the street at around midnight without disturbing the occupants. [...] Escaping through the streets to the north and west, Sheppard hid in a cowshed in Tottenham (near modern Tottenham Court Road). [...] Spotted by the barn's owner, Sheppard told him that he had escaped from Bridewell Prison, having been imprisoned there for failing to support a (nonexistent) bastard son. [...] His leg irons remained in place for several days until he persuaded a passing shoemaker to accept the considerable sum of 20 shillings to bring a blacksmith's tools and help him remove them, telling him the same tale. [...] His manacles and leg irons were later recovered in the rooms of Kate Cook, one of Sheppard's mistresses. [...] This escape astonished everyone. Daniel Defoe, working as a journalist, wrote an account for John Applebee, The History of the Remarkable Life of John Sheppard. [...] In his History, Defoe reports the belief in Newgate that the Devil came in person to assist Sheppard's escape.|$|E

5000|$|... "Despite its name, Black Bottom wasn't {{really a}} colored area. Most of its {{residents}} were immigrants, not negroes", states Boyle. Black Bottom was a neighborhood of the poor working-class people of Detroit. Boyle describes Black Bottom in his book as dingy and rundown, with rooms barely {{large enough to accommodate}} families. Homes in central Black Bottom were decaying. When it rained, water would flood <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings,</b> wind came <b>through</b> holes in <b>the</b> walls where the plaster had cracked off, and many of the windows had no glass.
