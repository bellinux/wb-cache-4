40|$|The initial aim of {{this work}} was the {{preparation}} of sensitized photoconductor layers for use in conjunction with d. c. electroluminescent panels to develop an optically triggered bistable system for sustaining pixel states during the frame time of dynamically addressed flat panel displays. More than 200 CdSe powder samples and devices were prepared in attempts to achieve the required response speed of approximately 1 millisecond and photocurrent density of at least 10 mA cm(^- 2) under expected operating conditions. Powder samples were sensitized by various dopant incorporation and heat treatment processes. Copper and halogen ions were introduced {{in the form of}} dilute solutions. Correlations between preparation conditions and photoelectronic behaviour were sought, additional information being obtained from various physical and chemical analytical techniques. Devices were prepared from sensitized powder samples by compression, sintering or mixing with a nitrocellulose binder. A screen printing process was employed to deposit powder-binder layers 40 - 70 microns in thickness. Although an optically <b>triggered</b> <b>bistable</b> <b>element</b> was not experimentally demonstrated, sensitized powder characteristics were successively improved to within an order of magnitude of those required. Response times of 2 - 10 milliseconds were recorded, and photo-response in a sandwich type powder-binder device was finally achieved with photocurrent density of approximately 100 mA cm(^- 2). Simple power law relationships between conductivity and applied voltage, pressure and photoexcitation intensity were experimentally established. Prolonged ball milling of CdSe powder was found to cause a wurtzite to sphalerite phase transition which was reversible by firing in air for 2 hours at 500 ºC. The estimated sphalerite lattice parameter was 6. 051 A. Long term variations in sample conductivities and photosensitivies were attributed primarily to oxygen adsorption in the presence of water vapour during storage. Photoelectronic characteristics indicative of both oxygen photoadsorption and photodesorption were observed, and explained in terms of dopant levels. Photoconductive processes in sensitized CdSe powder were shown to be dictated principally by surface chemistry and inter particle contacts...|$|E

New digital designs often include scan chains; high quality economical test is the reason. A scan chain allows easy access to internal combinational logic by converting <b>bistable</b> <b>elements,</b> latches and flip-flops, into a shift register.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{new concepts}} and methodology in designing shape-morphing structures using <b>bistable</b> <b>elements.</b> Developed using the Pseudo-Rigid-Body Model (PRBM), linear <b>bistable</b> compliant mechanism <b>elements</b> produce predictable and controllable length changes.

40|$|Multistability is an inseparable {{feature of}} many physical, {{chemical}} and biological systems which are driven far from equilibrium. In these nonequilibrium systems, stochastic dynamics often induces switching between distinct states on emergent timescales, for example, bistable switching is a natural feature of noisy, spatially-extended systems that consist of <b>bistable</b> <b>elements.</b> Nevertheless, here we present experimental evidence that <b>bistable</b> <b>elements</b> are not required for the global bistability of a system. We observe temporal switching between a crystalline, condensed state and a gas-like, excited state in a spatially-extended, quasi-two-dimensional system of charged microparticles.

40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that associative memory {{in the brain}} depends on multistable synaptic dynamics, which enable the synapses to maintain their value for extended periods of time. However, multistable dynamics are not restricted to synapses. In particular, the dynamics of some genetic regulatory networks are multistable, raising the possibility that even single cells, {{in the absence of}} a nervous system, are capable of learning associations. Here we study a standard genetic regulatory network model with <b>bistable</b> <b>elements</b> and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate that such a genetic regulatory network model is capable of learning multiple, general, overlapping associations. The capacity of the network, defined as the number of associations that can be simultaneously stored and retrieved, is proportional to the square root of the number of <b>bistable</b> <b>elements</b> in the genetic regulatory network. Moreover, we compute the capacity of a clonal population of cells, such as in a colony of bacteria or a tissue, to store associations. We show that even if the cells do not interact, the capacity of the population to store associations substantially exceeds that of a single cell and is proportional to the number of <b>bistable</b> <b>elements.</b> Thus, we show that even single cells are endowed with the computational power to learn associations, a power that is substantially enhanced when these cells form a population...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with beamlike spaceframes that include {{a large number of}} <b>bistable</b> <b>elements,</b> and exploit the bistability of the elements to obtain structures with multiple stable configurations. By increasing the number of <b>bistable</b> <b>elements,</b> structures with a large number of different configurations can be designed. A particular attraction of this approach is that it produces structures able to maintain their shape without any power being supplied. The first part of this paper focuses on the design and realization of a low-cost snap-through strut, whose two different lengths provide the required bistable feature. A parametric study of the length-change of the strut in relation to the peak force that needs to be applied by the driving actuators is carried out. Bistable struts based on this concept have been made by injection molding nylon. Next, beamlike structures based on different architectures are considered. It is shown that different structural architectures produce structures with workspaces of different size and resolution, when made from an identical number of bistable struts.

The material of the thermal switching element generates heat in response to electrical current flow therethrough, which in turn causes the material to undergo a thermal phase transition from a high electrical resistance state to a low electrical resistance state as the temperature increases above a predetermined value. Application of the electrical potential in one direction renders the thermal switching element conductive to pass electron current out of the ion source. This causes positive ions to flow from the source into the <b>bistable</b> switching <b>element</b> and intercalate the same to produce a non-volatile, low resistance logic state.

40|$|With a view {{to reduce}} the number of {{components}} in a Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) cell, the feasibility of use of Lambda Bipolar Transistor (LBT) in the <b>bistable</b> <b>element</b> of the cell has been explored under the present study. The LBT under consideration here comprises of an enhancement mode MOSFET integrated with a parasitic bipolar transistor so as to perform as a negative resistance device. LBTs for the study have been fabricated and analysed. The devices have been shown to function at much lower voltage and current levels than those reported earlier/ and thus have been shown to be suitable for lower power applications. The issues of agreements and discrepancies of the experimental results with the original DC model of the device have been highlighted and discussed. The factors contributing to the drain current of the MOSFET in the LBT have been identified. It has also been shown that in the real case of an LBT in operation, the MOSFET in it does not function as a discrete device for the same conditions of voltages and current levels as in an LBT. As per the present study, it is assessed to be influenced by the presence of the BJT in operation and this effect is felt more at the lower current levels of operation. With a separate and tailored p-well implantation the possibility of fabrication of LBTs with a CMOS technology is established. Along with a couple of polysilicon resistors, the LBTs have been successfully made to perform in the common-collector configuration as the <b>bistable</b> storage <b>element</b> of SRAM cell (as proposed in the literature). The <b>bistable</b> <b>element</b> with the LBT in common-emitter mode also has been visualised and practically achieved with the fabricated devices.

The power consumption of the <b>bistable</b> <b>element</b> with the LBT in either mode is however shown to be the same. A different approach of READING has been proposed to overcome the factors known to increase the cycle time.

Specific thermal/chemical reflow conditions were experimentally developed to produce hemispherical dome over a wide range. The second approach introduced a novel maskless procedure for fabricating the dome using grayscale lithography. After evaluating the above results, it was decided to use engineered compressive stress in released thin film sandwiches to form the 3 D dome structures required for bistable actuation.
