5|$|After her coronation, Anne {{settled into}} a quiet routine at the King's {{favourite}} residence, Greenwich Palace, to prepare for <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of her baby. The child was born slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533. Between three and four in the afternoon, Anne {{gave birth to a}} girl, who was christened Elizabeth, probably in honour of either or both Anne's mother Elizabeth Howard and Henry's mother, Elizabeth of York. But <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of a girl was a heavy blow to her parents, since they had confidently expected a boy. All but one of the royal physicians and astrologers had predicted a son for them and the French king had already been asked to stand as his godfather. Now the prepared letters announcing <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of a prince had an s hastily added to them to read princes and the traditional jousting tournament for <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of an heir was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|At {{least ten}} films have held {{the record of}} 'highest-grossing film' since <b>The</b> <b>Birth</b> of a Nation assumed the top spot in 1915.

Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when Jurassic Park overtook E.T., and Cameron emulated the feat when Avatar broke the record set by Titanic.|$|E

40|$|The {{pattern of}} <b>the</b> <b>births</b> during <b>the</b> week has been {{reported}} by many studies. <b>The</b> <b>births</b> occurred in weekends are found consistently less then births occurred in weekdays. This study employed two statistical methods, two-way ANOVA and two-way Friedman 2 ̆ 7 s test to analyse the daily variations in amount of births of 222, 735 births from 2005 - 2007 in Harris County, Texas. The two methods were compared on their assumptions, procedures and results. Both of the tests showed a significant result which indicated that <b>the</b> <b>births</b> through <b>the</b> week are not uniformly distributed. The result of multiple comparison demonstrated <b>the</b> <b>births</b> occurring on weekends were significantly different than <b>the</b> <b>births</b> occurring on weekdays with least amount on Sundays. ...|$|R

5|$|Only the {{children}} of the king could be born inside the Inner Court. Every detail of <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of the royal child was recorded, including the time of birth, which was to be used later by court astrologers to cast his or her horoscope. Ceremonies concerning <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> and the rites of passage of the child was performed within the walls of the Inner Court. <b>The</b> <b>birth</b> of a royal child was first announced by a succession of women who proclaimed the news along the Inner Court's streets. There were two waiting orchestras, one on the inside made of women and one on the outside of men, who would then carry out the official proclamation with conch shell fanfares. If the child was a prince the Gong of Victory was to be struck three times. The children would live with their respective mothers and be educated in special schools within the court.|$|E
