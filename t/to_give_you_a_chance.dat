6000|$|... "To-night I {{am going}} to offer you a great privilege," [...] she said. [...] "I am going <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of finding out {{the answer to your}} riddle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is an {{opportunity}} for you to fetch up a good deal of leeway. Master Bolt," [...] commenced the captain: [...] "and I am willing <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to help yourself. You know where you last left the Few-Folly, I suppose?" ...|$|E
60|$|Chiefly, however, {{remember}} {{the object of}} these three first examples is <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> index <b>to</b> your truest feelings about European, and especially about your native landscape, as it is pensive and historical; and so far as you yourselves make any effort at its representation, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> motive for fidelity in handwork more animating than any connected with mere success in the art itself.|$|R
5000|$|You {{will meet}} her first on 2 Spring when she visits your farm <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> dog.|$|R
60|$|To {{perform this}} with more clearness, {{it may be}} proper <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> short state of our unfortunate country.|$|R
6000|$|... "Comrade Brady," [...] said Psmith {{with some}} enthusiasm, [...] "I {{call that a}} {{sporting}} offer. I'm very much obliged. But we mustn't stand in your way. If you eliminate this Comrade Wood, they will have <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> against Jimmy Garvin, won't they?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To let you {{and your}} mother know of this woman's most unselfish behaviour; {{to put you on}} the 'qui vive' for what Eustace may do now; <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to make up for your folly. Moreover to warn you against----" [...] she paused.|$|E
6000|$|... "Comrade Brady," [...] said Smith with enthusiasm, [...] "I {{have had}} {{occasion}} before {{to call you}} sport. I do so again. But I'm {{not going to stand}} in your way. If you eliminate this Comrade Wood, they will have <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> against Jimmy Garvin, won't they?" ...|$|E
6000|$|ANNIE. Oh! please, ma'am, I was <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> message--very important-- from Miss Maud Builder [...] "Lookout! Father is coming!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Honora was {{a little}} taken aback, but {{recovered}} sufficiently to retort: [...] "You'd hardly expect me <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> unprejudiced judgment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'DEAR LITTLE GILL---I {{am going}} <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> new brother. Mother {{will tell you}} all.---Your loving sister, [...] 'P. E. M.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{on earth}} wouldn't {{you speak to}} her? I went on making speeches to Miss Macnulty on purpose <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b> Lizzie {{generally}} talks {{about as well as}} any young woman I know; but you had not a word to say to her, nor she to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{trying to}} be decent to you," [...] went on Kells, without turning. [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{to make the best}} of a bad situation. But you're a kid--a girl!... And I'm a bandit. A man lost to all good, who means to have you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Base wretch!" [...] said Peveril, {{withdrawing}} his pistol, yet {{keeping a}} watchful eye on Chiffinch's motions, [...] "thou art unworthy any honest man's sword; and yet, if you dare draw your own, as you proposed but now, I am willing <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> upon fair equality of terms." ...|$|E
5000|$|Today OpenCa {{supports}} the following elements:(this is an incomplete list just <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> impression of how complex {{the subject matter}} is): ...|$|R
5000|$|You cannot rely on {{university}} <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> {{complete and}} relevant education when professors {{are often more}} interested in researching than teaching.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, but I'll {{authorise}} my bankers <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> full {{statement of}} my receipts {{for the last}} five years--longer, if you like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought we}} talked all that over some time ago, Rupe. In {{a few months}} you'll {{be able to leave}} school, and I'll advise your father about putting you into {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for yourself. Patience, old fellow; you're doing very well. Consider--there's your pupil, Uncle Ben." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are alone}} here," [...] said Brigida. [...] "I am a woman, and I don't {{know that you}} may not have come armed. It is only the commonest {{precaution}} on my part not <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of getting at the wax mask till I have made my conditions." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{rushed into}} the room pouring out: [...] "I'm afraid you'll think the {{teachers}} have been shabby in not coming near you, but we wanted <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to get settled. I am Vida Sherwin, and I try to teach French and English {{and a few other}} things in the high school." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{his tongue}} too, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> lecture upon Radicalism, Miss,' said Sir Edward, with a fierce gesture, which drove Anne away laughing.|$|R
60|$|But pray permit me, before I go further, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> {{short history}} of the steps by which we arrived at this hopeful situation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's enough," [...] said McGinty, {{draining}} off his glass. [...] "I came down <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> word in season, and you've had it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a {{good deal}} of circumstantial evidence," [...] the old man said, solemnly, as he turned to leave, [...] "an' it stands you in hand to do all a boy can to clear your own skirts. I'm goin' <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance,</b> an' promise there won't be any arrest made to-day at all events." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here," [...] the {{spokesman}} began, [...] "we've come <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of actin' square. You {{know who we}} are, an' that what we do will help all hands who work here. Let us through peaceably, an' we'll allers be your friends, but if we're obliged {{to fight for it}} there'll be nothin' left of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You must bide your time, dear, {{and not be}} so impatient. Papa promised <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{before the}} season is over, and he always manages things nicely. That will be better than any queer prank of yours,' {{answered}} Bess, tying her pretty hair in a white net to match her suit, while Josie made a little lobster of herself in scarlet.|$|E
6000|$|At {{that moment}} Amelius {{appeared}} in the hall, and answered the question himself. [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> word of warning," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Any {{signs of}} the boat--look well into the bay of Naples--we are opening Campanella now {{sufficiently}} <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> good look up toward the head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Comrade Maloney," [...] he said, [...] "if the Editorial Staff of {{this paper}} were <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> day off, could you employ it to profit?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Fuller, [...] "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{of making}} good, {{because if you}} had done {{anything}} crooked, you wouldn't {{have told me that}} tale. You'll quit driving the locomotive and superintend on a section of the dam. I'm not satisfied with the fellow who's now in charge. He's friendly with the dago sub-contractors and I suspect I'm being robbed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want {{to leave}} without wakin' Phil, but you must do {{it as soon as}} I push off from the shore, for we don't intend <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of {{slipping}} away. I shall watch mighty close, an' if he isn't on his feet before I'm a dozen yards out into the creek you'll get a reminder from this," [...] and the man ostentatiously displayed a revolver.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is not legitimate, {{you would}} say," [...] {{observed}} Pungarin, [...] "but {{that is open}} to dispute. In my opinion this {{is a world of}} robbers; the only difference among us is that some are sneaking robbers, others are open. Every man to his taste. I have been doing a little of the world's work openly of late, and I come here with part of the result <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of robbing me in the other way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. And besides, {{they would}} like to know down there when you are coming home. They are sure <b>to</b> want <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> welcome." ...|$|R
60|$|MAGISTRATE. This is {{your first}} offence, and I am going <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> light sentence. [Speaking sharply, but without expression.] One month with hard labour.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you mean, Corrie, by such conduct?" [...] {{said his}} captor, shaking him vigorously. [...] "I have half <b>a</b> mind <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> wallopping." ...|$|R
