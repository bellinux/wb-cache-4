Jai is amazed by Sahil's skill as a guitarist and {{suggests}} that he pursue {{a career as a}} fulltime musician. Later, he gifts him a guitar during lunch. The two engage in several arguments and bicker about their plans throughout the trip, while enjoying each other's company nonetheless. Sahil is irked by Jai's indifferent behaviour and finds it annoying that he works even during the trip. Jai too is not pleased with Sahil's continuous badgering. One night, the two get into a heated argument over their differences. Later, Jai embraces Sahil in his bed and tries to kiss him. The latter resists, and asks Jai <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> as they have to get up early the next morning.|$|E

At Dean's funeral, Kris sees a photograph of her and Dean as children, but cannot recall ever knowing Dean before high school. Kris begins to dream about the burned man herself and refuses <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> for fear that she will die in her dreams.

Covered in her blood, Jesse runs to Nancy's house and learns that Nancy has been having dreams about the same man: Freddy Krueger (Jackie Earle Haley).|$|E
25|$|Though {{the reasons}} for the {{relationship}} are not clear, there also exists a relationship between procrastination and eveningness; that is, those who procrastinate more are more likely <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> later and wake later. It is known that conscientiousness increases across the lifespan, as does morningness. Procrastination too decreases with age. However, even controlling for age, there still exists a relationship between procrastination and eveningness, which is yet to be explained.|$|E

[...] This is a reference to Judah Friedlander, who portrays Frank in the show and {{who is known for}} his trademark trucker hats which he wears {{in and out of the}} Frank character. When Liz tells Floyd that she saw him on The Today Show, on which she learned he is getting married, Floyd says [...] "Dammit!

500|$|A {{recurring}} {{source of}} lyrical subject matter in Let the Blind Lead is Cox's best friend, Deerhunter guitarist Lockett Pundt, whom {{the album is}} dedicated to. [...] "Winter Vacation" [...] concerns {{the first time the}} two met. Seeing him at a bus stop while vacationing in Savannah, Georgia, Cox was [...] "attracted to him, but not in some kind of like, just physical way." [...] Seeing [...] "his melancholy, his sitting alone, staring at the ground", he [...] "fell in love" [...] with him. Cox and his family later drove to a beach; [...] "Winter Vacation" [...] relates to Cox’s memory of the beach, being [...] "infected with that new love" [...] found after meeting Pundt. The words of [...] "Scraping Past" [...] are about [...] "moving on…And wondering if somebody is going to come with you or…stay behind." [...] This uncertainty is characterized by several lines Cox considers [...] "pop song clichés", referencing [...] "rain that comes and goes." [...] In the song, Cox asks Pundt, [...] "Are you going to come with me, or are you staying here?" [...] In [...] "Ativan" [...] Cox examines his addiction to the drug of the same name, as well as his relationship with Pundt. [...] "It talks a lot about how things have changed between me and Lockett's relationship and how he's met a girl and…our friendship is never gonna change, but it's difficult sometimes." [...] Cox asserts that he would [...] "rather just take whatever drugs it takes <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> and sleep through it…I'm not prepared to face it yet." ...|$|E

500|$|He wrote [...] "Day 'n' Nite" [...] {{after the}} death of his uncle. The two were not on {{speaking}} terms after his uncle forced him out of his home before Cudi could find another living situation. A [...] bitter Cudi never apologized to him before his death, which he now regrets. Other songs on the album expand upon themes discussed in that single. Back in 2007, Drake, who was one of Cudi's first supporters, had shown interest in doing an official remix of [...] the song with him. However, Cudi chose against it since he was not interested in working with people who are in the [...] "same creative realm" [...] as him and because he was in the midst of creating his own works. Beginning in the fourth grade, and getting more tense after his father's death when he was 11, Cudi began dreaming of his own death (which usually was an automobile accident). He channeled these things into his material. Speaking to BlackBook in May 2009, Cudi said of the album and its content, [...] "Each song is a message. All the hooks are stadium-worthy, crowd sing-along, powerful joints that I can't wait for people to hear in stadium magnitude. My album definitely needs to be heard loudly, but it's also a great album if you're smoking and you need <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> So far I have the lineup of how I want the first seven tracks on my album and if I play the first seven from the beginning to the end, I'm zoned out and it's the best trip ever. You need to be high to appreciate the instrumentation and how everything is put together on the album—but you don't have to be high just to enjoy it in general." ...|$|E

She explained it was inspired by [...] "me imagining [...] and any female musician touring the world.

[...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was made available on iTunes the same day, several days earlier than originally planned. Following the announcement, Kesha spoke to MTV News stating that [...] "I consider myself a songwriter before and above everything else, so it's an honor to write for one of pop music's biggest icons." [...] During an interview with Seacrest, Spears described [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] as [...] "fun. I like it. It's good energy.

2500|$|In the past, {{prior to}} {{beginning}} of the segment, Cramer would abuse the office chair provided for him by throwing {{it on top of}} other [...] "victims" [...] (damaged office chairs), also damaging the studio's wall and glass displays as well. The damage was made apparent by a caller in the [...] "Lightning Round" [...] on March1, 2006, which prompted Cramer to throw his chair again at the glass display, causing it to crack even more. Cramer has said that the reason why he throws chairs is because he hates sitting down on the job. He often had to be at his old hedge fund by 4:30a.m., and if his employees sat down they would often try <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> so chairs became [...] "the enemy".|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, {{published}} some 65 years later, Kipling {{recalled the}} stay with horror, and wondered ironically if {{the combination of}} cruelty and neglect which he experienced there {{at the hands of}} Mrs. Holloway might not have hastened the onset of his literary life: [...] "If you cross-examine a child of seven or eight on his day’s doings (specially when he wants <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep)</b> he will contradict himself very satisfactorily. If each contradiction be set down as a lie and retailed at breakfast, life is not easy. I have known a certain amount of bullying, but this was calculated torture—religious as well as scientific. Yet it made me give attention to the lies I soon found it necessary to tell: and this, I presume, is the foundation of literary effort".|$|E

2500|$|Legends tell of slighted kobolds {{becoming}} quite malevolent and vengeful, afflicting errant hosts with supernatural diseases, disfigurements, and injuries. Their pranks {{range from}} beating the servants to murdering those who insult them. One holyman visited {{the home of}} Heinzelmann and {{refused to accept the}} kobold's protests that he was a Christian. Heinzelmann threatened him, and the nobleman fled. Another nobleman refused to drink to the kobold's honour, which prompted Heinzelmann to drag the man to the ground and choke him near to death. When a kitchen servant got dirt on the kobold Hödekin and sprayed him with water each time he appeared, Hödekin asked that the boy be punished, but the steward dismissed the behaviour as a childish prank. Hodeken waited for the servant <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> and then strangled him, tore him limb from limb, and threw him in a pot over the fire. The head cook rebuked the kobold for the murder, so Hodeken squeezed toad blood onto the meat being prepared for the bishop. The cook chastised the spirit for this behaviour, so Hodeken threw him over the drawbridge into the moat. According to Lüthi, these abilities reflect the fear of the people who believe in them. Thomas Keightley has attributed the feats of kobolds to [...] "ventriloquism and the contrivances of servants and others." ...|$|E
