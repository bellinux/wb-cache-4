The medical industry also uses the blood of horseshoe crabs as a <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> presence of contaminant bacteria. Mites can cause allergies in humans, transmit several diseases to humans and their livestock, and are serious agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|An old {{qualitative}} <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{presence of}} the alkene functional group is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a bromohydrin {{with some of the}} dibromoalkane also produced.

5|$|Envenomation from a redback spider bite {{produces}} a syndrome known as latrodectism. A {{small but significant}} percentage of people bitten develop significant pain or systemic symptoms.

5|$|Following several stages won by sprinters and {{breakaway}}s, {{the next}} <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> riders was the legendary Alto de El Angliru in Stage 13. The morning breakaway was afforded over eleven minutes, {{but it was}} dropped to nothing on the ascent {{of what has been}} called the most difficult climb in all of professional cycling. Astana and Caisse d'Epargne both had many support riders in the leading group going up the climb, and they alternately tried to set paces to protect either Contador or Alejandro Valverde while isolating the competition. It was left to Leipheimer to pace Contador to the conclusion as the climb reached its hardest part, 7 kilometers from the finish. Contador indeed {{went on to win the}} stage, and took the race lead as well. Contador added another stage win the next day when only he and Leipheimer could respond to the repeated attacks of Ezequiel Mosquera, and Contador won the sprint.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{started his}} Grand Prix career during the 1991 {{season as a}} test driver with the championship-winning Williams team while still {{competing}} in the F3000 series. However, midway through 1992 Hill broke into Grand Prix racing as a driver with the dying Brabham team. The formerly competitive team was in serious financial difficulties. Hill started the season only after three races, replacing Giovanna Amati after her sponsorship had failed to materialise. Amati {{had been unable to}} get the car through qualifying but Hill matched his team-mate, Eric van de Poele, by qualifying for two races, the mid-season British and Hungarian Grands Prix. Hill continued to <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Williams team that year and the British Grand Prix saw Nigel Mansell win the race for Williams, while he finished last in the Brabham. The Brabham team collapsed after the Hungarian Grand Prix and did not complete the season.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the genetic <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of animal testing and embryonic stem cells.|$|E

5|$|In 1452, {{the newly}} acceded Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II ordered his first {{campaign}} against Skanderbeg, {{the chief of}} the League of Lezhë. Shortly after the First Siege of Krujë, Murad II died in Edirne, only to be succeeded by his son Mehmed II. Mehmed always supported more aggressive strategies of conquest which his father had continually rejected. Once in power, Mehmed ordered nearly annual invasions of Albania which often resulted in multiple battles in one year. The first of these expeditions was sent in 1452 under the dual-command of Hamza Pasha and Tahip Pasha, with an army of approximately 25,000 men. This campaign was the first major <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new Sultan against western Europe and a high point of a diplomatic struggle between the major Mediterranean powers.|$|E

5|$|In early 1999, Yoshiki Okamoto, {{then head}} of Capcom's screenwriter {{subsidiary}} Flagship, proposed his idea of remaking the original The Legend of Zelda for the Game Boy Color to Shigeru Miyamoto, the game designer at Nintendo who created the series. Okamoto was eventually asked to develop six Zelda games for the Game Boy Color: two based on earlier installments and four original entries into the series. Okamoto wanted to release them in quick succession of four to five months, and held on to his concept of bringing the first game to the handheld console to make young children experience {{the merits of the}} original Zelda, but also as a <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development team to move on to a more ambitious sequel if {{it turned out to be}} successful.|$|E
