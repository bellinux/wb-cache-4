40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effect of academic advising on changing or maintaining majors in university degrees. It is also a goal of the study to determine which semester students change <b>their</b> <b>majors</b> and whether advising contributes to that change. Through this correlational study, the researchers explored students’ perceptions about the academic advising they received and the relationship of its absence on students’ major change. The participants were 1725 undergraduate students from all year levels. The survey used to collect the data for this study is: the Influences on Choice of Major survey. Based on the findings, it was found that university advisors have a very poor effect on students’ decisions to select <b>their</b> <b>majors</b> as 45. 6 % of the 1725 participants indicated no influence of advising in their survey answers. Whereas career advancement opportunities, students’ interests, and job opportunities indicate a strong effect on their majors’ selections, as they score the highest means of 3. 76, 3. 73, and 3. 64, respectively. In addition, findings show that students are most likely changing <b>their</b> <b>majors</b> in <b>their</b> second year, and specifically in the second semester. Second year major change scored 36. 9 % in the second semester and 30. 9 % in the first semester. More importantly, results indicate that there is a positive significant correlation between college advisors and major change in the second year (p = 0. 000). It is to researchers’ understanding based on the findings that when students receive enough academic advising in the first year of study, and this advising continues steadily into the next year, the probability of students changing <b>their</b> <b>majors</b> decreases greatly...|$|R

5|$|Owing to {{the expense}} of {{refining}} pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite which {{plays a key role}} in aluminium refining. Organic fluorides have very high chemical and thermal stability; <b>their</b> <b>major</b> uses are as refrigerants, electrical insulation and cookware, the last as PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine also contain fluorine, and the fluoride ion inhibits dental cavities, and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation.

40|$|Introduction: Increasing {{numbers of}} medical {{sciences}} graduates is counted {{to be one}} of the problems in the society, so that there is concerning about <b>their</b> <b>majors</b> and future careers among them. This study was performed with the aim of determining environmental health students' attitude toward <b>their</b> <b>majors</b> and future careers, which was carried out in Yazd University of Medical Sciences in 2015. Method: This analytical, descriptive study was performed in 2015. The samples were Environmental Health students of Yazd University of Medical Sciences. The sample size was 102. Data were collected using a questionnaire containing 20 questions and analyzed by SPSS software version 21, multiple linear regression test, one-sample t-test and Chi-Square test. Results: The mean and standard deviation of environmental students' attitude toward <b>their</b> <b>majors</b> and future careers were 3. 16 and 0. 66, respectively. Attitude scores more than 3 were considered positive and less than 3 were negative. The mean scores of attitude was significantly higher than 3 (P= 0. 012). In this study, there was a significant relationship between students’ attitude and location status (P= 0. 003). Conclusion: According to the obtained results, the students of environment health had a good perspective towards their future careers and majors of study. A proper distribution of human resources, providing financial support of employment, establishing counselling and supporting centers among students for future career is recommended to improve their attitudes...|$|R
