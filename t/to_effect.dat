5|$|After being {{occupied}} with suppressing the revolt of Bardas Phokas {{throughout the year}} 970, Tzimiskes marshalled his forces in early 971 for a campaign against the Rus', moving his troops from Asia to Thrace and gathering supplies and siege equipment. The Byzantine navy accompanied the expedition, tasked with carrying troops <b>to</b> <b>effect</b> a landing in the enemy's rear and to cut off their retreat across the Danube. The emperor chose Easter week of 971 to make his move, catching the Rus' completely by surprise: The passes of the Balkan mountains had been left unguarded, either because the Rus' were busy suppressing Bulgarian revolts or perhaps (as A.D. Stokes suggests) because a peace agreement that had been concluded after the battle of Arcadiopolis made them complacent.|$|E
5|$|As Duckworth {{gathered}} his squadron, Northumberlands mainmast collapsed across the deck, causing severe {{damage to the}} ship's fittings. Although Cochrane's flagship was the most severely damaged of the squadron, all had suffered to a degree: Superbs men counted 60 shot holes while Atlas {{was out of control}} and Donegal had lost one of her topmasts. Casualties were also distributed throughout the fleet, with Northumberland and Spencer suffering the worst and Atlas the least except for the barely engaged Agamemnon. Total losses were 74 killed and 264 wounded and several ships were damaged, but Duckworth was rapidly able <b>to</b> <b>effect</b> repairs as his ships remained on station to observe the situation ashore.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the late 1380s and early 1390s, Isabeau {{demonstrated}} that she possessed diplomatic influence when the Florentine delegation requested her political intervention in the Gian Galeazzo Visconti affair. Orl√©ans and the Duke of Burgundy were in the pro-Visconti faction while the anti-Visconti faction included Isabeau, her brother, Louis VII, Duke of Bavaria, and John III, Count of Armagnac. At that time Isabeau lacked the political power <b>to</b> <b>effect</b> change. Some years later, however, at the 1396 wedding of her seven-year-old daughter, Isabella, to Richard II of England (an event at which Charles attacked a herald for wearing Galeazzo's livery), Isabeau successfully negotiated an alliance between France and Florence with Florentine ambassador Buonaccorso Pitti.|$|E

5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece <b>to</b> <b>effect</b> the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E

His efforts helped form the Constitutional Union Party later that year. Chosen as the keynote speaker at the party's national convention on May 9, 1860, many urged him to become their nominee for president. At age seventy-three, however, Crittenden was already contemplating retirement and instead orchestrated the nomination of John Bell, whom he actively supported in the 1860 presidential race.|$|E

5|$|M. nigrocincta ants are diurnal {{and do not}} hibernate. They are omnivores, {{and feed}} on other insects {{including}} caterpillars and spiders, as well as honey water. M. nigrocincta has been observed to prey on the larvae of imperial hairstreak butterflies, even jumping while carrying them. Predators of the M. nigrocincta (and the Myrmecia genus as a whole) includes spiders, birds, lizards, mammals and other predatory invertebrates, including assassin bugs and Redbacks. The ants have been recorded visiting flowers of Eucalyptus regnans and Senna acclinis and are considered as a possible pollination vector for E. regnans trees. Although Senna acclinis is self-compatible, the inability of M. nigrocincta to appropriately release pollen would restrict capacity <b>to</b> <b>effect</b> pollination.|$|E

Magoffin agreed to resign if the Senate would elect Robinson as Speaker, putting him next in line for the governorship. This was done, and at 10:00am on August 18, 1862, Robinson succeeded Magoffin upon the latter's resignation.
