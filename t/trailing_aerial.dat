At 15:24, the aircraft contacted RAF Manston and asked for the weather report. Manston had difficulty communicating with the aircraft, which should have been communicating via Uxbridge ATC. It was not until 15:45 that Manston was able to locate the aircraft's position, which was then [...] south east of Cap Gris Nez. At 15:52, the captain told Lympne that he had only 25 minutes fuel remaining. A PAN call was made at 15:58, followed by an SOS call at 16:02, giving the aircraft's position as [...] A further SOS call was made between 16:03 and 16:04 was abruptly curtailed.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was a single-engined biplane constructed of wood with sharply-tapered wings and fabric-covered control surfaces. An enclosed cabin with one seat was provided so the Queen Wasp could be flown manually {{with the radio}} control system turned off. The radio control system was complex {{with a number of}} backup safety devices to ensure radio and battery operation was uninterrupted. A trailing receiver aerial was winched out after takeoff and served as an automatic landing device which was activated when the <b>trailing</b> <b>aerial</b> weight hit the runway. The sensitivity of the system in turbulent weather meant that an alternative landing signal was used to initiate a landing procedure.|$|E
50|$|Immediately {{behind the}} pilot's {{position}} {{is a small}} folding seat fixed to the starboard side of the fuselage for an additional crew member or passenger, along with racks that would contain a pair of parachute packs that would be clipped onto the harnesses worn by both the pilot and the navigator. Behind these is the navigator's station, a chair and table provisioned with navigational aids such as compasses, Bigsworth chart boards, sea markers, calculators for course, wind and speed, a signalling lamp and float flares. Aft of the rear spar is the wireless operator's station, this being a table furnished with contemporary wireless apparatus of the era, including a winch for the <b>trailing</b> <b>aerial,</b> which {{was attached to the}} upper fuselage immediately behind the aircraft's cockpit.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the final}} {{months of the}} conflict, the Bristol Fighter was used in a {{pioneering}} new capability {{in the form of}} radio communications; No. 11 Squadron was the first such squadron to be equipped. When equipped with this system, only the flight commander's Fighter would be equipped with a transmitter while others were outfitted with receivers, allowing for one-way communication of orders; as the <b>trailing</b> <b>aerials</b> employed needed to be wound in prior to aerial combat, this requirement reduced the usefulness of the system. The Fighter also participated in experiments held by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) into the use of parachutes, resulting in several aircraft being modified to carry static-line parachutes within the underside of the fuselage; these trials continued following the signing of the Armistice.|$|R

5000|$|FuG 10 series: A {{family of}} {{transceivers}} for both R/T and W/T communications. The German FuG 10 panel, or rack, contained two transmitters and two receivers: One transmitter and its companion receiver operated in the MF or Longwave; 300 to 600 kHz (1,000 to 500 m) range {{and the other}} transmitter and its companion receiver operated in the HF or Shortwave range; 3 to 6 MHz (100 to 50 m). Most of the FuG 10 series used a fixed wire aerial between the fuselage and tailfin or a retractable <b>trailing</b> <b>aerial</b> wire. The FuG 10P replaced the standard E 10L longwave receiver with an EZ6 unit for a G6 direction finding set. The FuG 10ZY incorporated a fixed loop D/F aerial and a homing device for navigation to a ground station. This loop aerial, usually fitted on a small, [...] "teardrop" [...] shaped mounting, was standard equipment on most fighter aircraft from late 1943 on. Manufactured by Lorenz. Typical power was 70 watts.|$|E

One of Hepburn's opinions {{reported in the}} book regards the use of radio, or wireless telephone, in the plane. [...] "His chief objection to it is that one cannot stunt a machine with 150 feet of <b>aerial</b> <b>trailing</b> underneath the fuselage; and that one might very well find oneself involved in a scrap before one has the time to wind it up, with a possible result that the wire might get entangled in the propeller and so wreck the machine in mid-air." ...|$|R
40|$|Remotely sensed aerial and {{satellite}} imagery are valuable tools for identification and mapping of historical sites. Application of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery and Geographic Information System (GIS) {{provide a more}} efficient way of identification, recording, and mapping historic sites associated linear features. In this research an integration of RS and GIS was used to identify and map the historical foot and camel trail in Jabal Kara, which forms {{part of the old}} caravan rout between Makkah and Taif in Saudi Arabia. It was constructed during the 4 th century Hegira, and continued to be used till 50 years ago. Parts of this trail were destroyed during the construction of a high way in late 1950 ’s. Our particular interest was documentation, and proposing a concept for rehabilitation. An aerial photo taken in 1953 was used with an IKONOS image of 2003 to identify and map this <b>trail.</b> The <b>Aerial</b> photo (scale of 1 : 48000) and IKONOS image were geo-referenced with ground control points (from a map). Highway and trail features were digitized using ArcView GIS. Trail length, width and slope were identified. Finally, a GIS database was build to be used for rehabilitation of this trail...|$|R
50|$|California Trail is {{the only}} part of this {{initiative}} open to the public. Guests will travel to the <b>Trail</b> via an <b>aerial</b> gondola from the existing zoo. Along the trail, they will encounter various animals, such as American bison. A half-acre California Kids’ Zone will introduce young children and their families to California wildlife and habitats through themed play structures. Inside an interpretive center with a wall-length window into the grizzly habitat, visitors will explore California’s diverse habitats, step into the shoes of conservation researchers, and find their place {{as a member of a}} community of people taking action for California’s wildlife. The gondola, visitor's center and restaurant are slated to open summer 2017. The rest of California Trail is slated to open summer 2018.|$|R
5|$|A {{communications}} variant designated Tu-142MR ("Bear J") was {{the last}} production version of the Tu-142. It was tasked with long-range communications duties with Soviet ballistic missile submarines, a role {{similar to that of}} the Boeing E-6 Mercury. The Tu-142MR differed from the ASW Tu-142s in having less-sophisticated avionics, but had a long <b>trailing</b> wire radio <b>aerial</b> to relay messages to submerged Soviet submarines in times of nuclear war. This was amongst the many distinctive features of the Tu-142MR that allows it to communicate with satellites, airborne and ground-based command posts, and submarines. The aircraft replaced the Ilyushin Il-80 in the airborne command and control role. Tu-142s are currently operated by the 76th Naval Aviation Regiment from Kipelovo. Other developments of the Tu-142 include the one-off Tu-142MRT maritime reconnaissance variant, and the unbuilt Tu-142MS missile-carrying variant.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is located}} in an urban area, in the November 10 Park district. It was created in 1992 to be an area of {{ecological}} interest. It covers an area of [...] of forest remaining from the Township, and is used for scientific, educational, cultural and tourist activities. It {{is one of the}} last habitats for the sauim-de-coleira, a species of monkey that only exists in the Manaus region and is threatened with extinction. It is possible to walk through four distinct ecosystems in the park: land covered by secondary growth, firm ground brush, sandbanks and degraded areas that were illegally cleared in 1989. It also has an amphitheater for 600 people, gardens planted with medicinal and aromatic herbs, orchid nursery, <b>aerial</b> <b>trails</b> and signs aiming to develop environmental education programs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principle}} of Trident's operation {{is known as}} Continuous At-Sea Deterrence (CASD), which means {{that at least one}} submarine is always on patrol. Another submarine is usually undergoing maintenance and the remaining two are in port or on training exercises. During a patrol, the submarine is required to remain silent and is allowed to make contact with the United Kingdom only in an emergency. It navigates using mapped contour lines of the ocean floor and patrols a series of planned [...] "boxes" [...] measuring several thousand square miles. A 1,000-metre-long <b>aerial</b> <b>trails</b> on the surface behind the submarine to pick up incoming messages. Intelligence is constantly relayed to the vessel, giving details of shipping movements and potentially hostile aircraft or submarines in the area. Most of the 150 crew never know where they are or where they have been.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} learning approach for finding recreational <b>trails</b> in <b>aerial</b> images. While {{the problem of}} recognizing relatively straight and well defined roadways in digital images has been well studied in the literature, the more difficult problem of extracting trails has received no attention. However, trails and rough roads {{are less likely to}} be adequately mapped, and change more rapidly over time. Automated tools for finding trails will be useful to cartographers, recreational users and governments. In addition, the methods developed here are applicable to the more general problem of finding linear structure. Our approach combines local estimates for image pixel trail probabilities with the global constraint that such pixels must link together to form a path. For the local part, we present results using three classification techniques. To construct a global solution (a trail) from these probabilities, we propose a global cost function that includes both global probability and path length. We show that the addition of a length term significantly improves trail finding ability. However, computing the optimal trail becomes intractable as known dynamic programming methods do not apply. Thus we describe a new splitting heuristic based on Dijkstra’s algorithm. We then further improve upon the results with a trail sampling scheme. We test our approach on 500 challenging images along the 2500 mile continental divide mountain bike trail, where assumptions prevalent in the road literature are violated. 1...|$|R
60|$|And {{with that}} {{incandescence}} came a sound, the first sound that had reached us from without since {{we left the}} earth, a hissing and rustling, the stormy <b>trailing</b> of the <b>aerial</b> garment of the advancing day. And {{with the coming of}} the sound and the light the sphere lurched, and blinded and dazzled we staggered helplessly against each other. It lurched again, and the hissing grew louder. I had shut my eyes perforce, I was making clumsy efforts to cover my head with my blanket, and this second lurch sent me helplessly off my feet. I fell against the bale, and opening my eyes had a momentary glimpse of the air just outside our glass. It was running--it was boiling--like snow into which a white-hot rod is thrust. What had been solid air had suddenly at the touch of the sun become a paste, a mud, a slushy liquefaction, that hissed and bubbled into gas.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{new method}} is {{described}} for enhancing low-con-trast curvilinear features in imagery that combines directional fil-tering with Fischler, Tenenbaum and Wolf’s algorithm for com-puting minimum cost paths. The method exploits a phenomenon called “the stability of lines over angle. ” The {{idea is that}} when a di-rectionally filtered image contains a line plus noise, minimum cost paths tend to be aligned {{in the direction of}} the line with random jumps between parallel paths. When the input image contains noise only, the direction of minimum cost paths resemble random walks with drift. As the direction of the filter changes, minimum cost paths that follow true features persist and are more stable over angle than those that follow noise. Adding them up in an accumu-lator array over angle produces a larger number of votes along signal paths than along noise paths. This provides a means for en-hancing trajectories of low-contrast features. Several examples il-lustrate the enhancement of forest <b>trails</b> in USGS <b>aerial</b> imagery, linear features on Mars, and roads in synthetic aperture radar im-agery. Index Terms—Image enhancement, algorithm, low-contrast curvilinear feature extraction, track-before-detect. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} use and {{appreciation}} of an Alpine mountain farming landscape with their necessary management and infrastructure in the protected area Allgäuer Hochalpen. We used a method mix to analyse official and informal <b>trail</b> use, combining <b>aerial</b> photos, pictures posted on the internet, interviews with farmers and hikers as well as observations. To assess the appreciation of different landscape elements, photos posted {{on the internet and}} their description were evaluated and interviews conducted with hikers. Only about half of the interviewees are bound for longer hikes, most of them return to the gondola after hiking for one hour. Informal trails in the study area were only used by less than 0. 5 % mainly to reach a mountain top or to hike around the entire lake. It could be shown that panoramic views, the lake and meadows that depending on traditional mountain farming are best liked by the interviewed hikers, who perceive it as a natural landscape. They disliked traces of the necessary infrastructure and landscape management. Since informal trail use and lack of knowledge about the protection status is not an issue in the study area, the focus should be shifted more towards raising awareness and communicating the importance of mountain farming and its contribution to biodiversity and scenic attractiveness...|$|R
25|$|However, {{early in}} Deathly Hallows, Tonks announces {{that she has}} {{recently}} married Remus Lupin. Tonks accompanies twelve Order members to take Harry from the Dursleys' home to The Burrow. She flies with Ron, who impersonates Harry using Polyjuice Potion to throw the Death Eaters off the real Harry's <b>trail.</b> During the <b>aerial</b> battle, Tonks fights Bellatrix again, and injures Bellatrix's husband, Rodolphus. Later in the book, Remus reveals Tonks is pregnant. He leaves her for a brief period, believing that he, through their marriage, has caused her to become an outcast and their unborn child {{would be better off}} without him, but changes his mind and returns to her side after a heated argument with Harry. In April of the seventh book, Tonks gives birth to Teddy Remus Lupin, named after her father and husband. Towards the end of the book, Tonks and Lupin join the Battle of Hogwarts. During the battle, Tonks is killed by Bellatrix, and Lupin is killed by Antonin Dolohov, leaving Teddy an orphan to be raised by his maternal grandmother, Andromeda. In an interview shortly after the release of Deathly Hallows, Rowling confessed that she had originally intended for Tonks and Lupin to survive the series ending, but felt that she had to kill them after she spared Arthur Weasley in Order of the Phoenix. Tonks' killer, Bellatrix is in turn killed by Molly.|$|R
40|$|May your trails be crooked, winding, lonesome, dangerous, {{leading to}} the most amazing view. May your {{mountains}} rise into and above the clouds. Edward Abbey The digital representation of trails {{is a relatively new}} concept. Only in the last decade, with increasing adoption and accuracy of GPS technology, have large quantities of reliable data become a reality. However, the development of algorithms specific to processing digital trails has not had much attention. This dissertation presents a set of methods for collecting, improving and processing digital trails, laying the ground work for the science of trails. We first present a solution to the GPS-network problem, which determines the salient trails and structure of a trail network from a set of GPS tracklogs. This method has received significant attention from the industry and online GPS sharing sites, since it provides the basis for forming a digital library of trails from user submitted GPS tracks. A set of tracks through a GPS trail network further presents the opportunity to model and understand trail user behavior. Trail user models are useful to land managers faced with difficult management decisions. We present the K-history model, a probabilistic method for understanding and simulating trail user decisions based on GPS data. We use the K-history model to evaluate current simulation techniques and show how optimizing the number of historical decisions can lead to better predictive power. With collections of GPS trail data we can begin to learn what trails look like in aerial images. We present a statistical learning approach for automatically extracting <b>trail</b> data from <b>aerial</b> imagery, using GPS data to train our model. While the problem of recognizing relatively straight and well defined roads has been well studied in the literature, the more difficult problem of extracting trails has received no attention. We extensively test our method on a 2, 500 mile trail, showing promise for obtaining digital trail data without the use of GPS. These methods present further possibilities for the study of trails and trail user behavior, resulting in increased opportunity for the outdoors lover, and more informed management of our natural areas...|$|R
