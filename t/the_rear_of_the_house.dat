5|$|Berkeley House on Piccadilly {{was named}} after John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton who had {{purchased}} its land, and that surrounding it, shortly after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. In 1696, the Berkeley family sold the house and grounds to the 1st Duke of Devonshire (who renamed it Devonshire House) on the proviso that the view from <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> should not be spoiled. Berkeley Square was laid out to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> in the 1730s; because of the conditions of sale, houses were only built on {{the east and west}} sides of it. The west side still has various mid-18th century buildings along it, while the east side now contains offices including Berkeley Square House.|$|E
5|$|The house stands {{mostly as}} it did in 1861 save a few alterations. The front porch was {{screened}} in at the time the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places, the screens have since been removed. At <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> a small porch was enclosed. In 1909 or 1910 there were major subtractions and replacements. Removed were a cast-iron widow's walk along the roof ridge and a large gable dormer, decorated {{in the same manner as}} the cornice decorating the roof trim. The present dormer replaced the larger one and is more of a low-shed type.|$|E

This door is of similar design to the front door at the north of the house, and has four steps of Portland stone accompanied by balustrades also of Portland stone.|$|E
5|$|The {{house at}} Valley View is a two-story brick Greek Revival-style {{structure}} with a rectangular architectural plan. The front entrance {{is covered by}} a small portico, topped with a pediment supported by wooden Doric columns. <b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> with a two-story (double) wood porch stretching across it, faces the South Branch Potomac River valley and Mill Creek Mountain. Each of the original eight large rooms of the 1855 structure contains a fireplace framed by a wooden trabeated mantelpiece with classical elements. The original windows, wooden trim, and materials in the main section of the house are intact. In 2012, Valley View was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its locally significant architecture.|$|E
5|$|The newer building, {{constructed}} in 1752 {{under the guidance}} of architects William Hiorne and his brother David, consists of five bays, with a large bay at the side, constructed around 1800 to connect it to the older building. There is a central portico, with a flat roof supported by four ionic columns, added in 1926. The tripartite windows of the ground floor contrast with the French windows of the first floor, which are fronted by cast iron balconies. The attic floor has small 4 x 2 pane windows. <b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> consists of four bays, with a large central window on the first floor and a central door, surrounded with ashlar cornicing. Both sections of the house are {{constructed in}} red Flemish bond brick, which, until 1926, was covered with render.|$|E

5|$|Built in 1837, the Acors Barns House is a two-and-one half story Greek Revival {{house with}} a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade {{of the house is}} five bays wide with 6-over-6 sash and the main {{entrance}} has a Greek Revival portico supported by fluted Doric columns from top step. The simple single-panel door is surrounded by sidelights. The corners of the building have simple pilasters and four chimneys rising from the top. <b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> has a one-story veranda with a shallow hipped roof that is supported by square columns with a simple balustrade.

5|$|Tinne {{studied as}} a {{domestic}} science teacher at Edinburgh School of Cookery, between 1904 and 1906, then moved to Aigburth, Liverpool {{to live with her}} maternal uncle, William Brogden Patterson. There she found a teaching role at Liverpool Training School of Cookery & Technical College of Domestic Service, where she remained for three years until 1909. During this period Tinne became engaged to Philip Frederick Tinne, a general practitioner whose family had a history as profitable sugar merchants and ship owners. The couple married at the Welsh Presbyterian Church in Toxteth, Liverpool on 14 July 1910 and moved into a cottage in Aigburth. They had six children, Elspeth, John, Bertha, Helen, Alexine and Philip, along with another who died in infancy, and the growing family meant that they moved into a larger property in 1923 with an extension large enough for Philip's surgery at <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} {{gates and}} wall separating the gardens {{from the park}} and farmland date from 1878 and are listed at grade II. The wrought-iron gates are by Cubitt & Co., and were exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1878. Two outer single gates and a double inner gate are supported by four sandstone piers. The outer pair of gate piers are capped by a bud-shaped device supported on scrolls; the inner pair are surmounted by a griffin and a lion, mirroring the statuary of the hall's terraces. The lower gate sections of lyre-like panels with leaf and spearhead motifs are topped with Jacobean-style arched panels. The ornate gate overthrows include shields and emblems capped with crowns, sheaves and sickles. The inner gates bear the inscription Quid retribuam domino ("What can I render to the Lord?"), while the outer gates bear the date. The wall, of brick with stone dressings, features arcading and has piers surmounted with ogee caps carved to match the tiles of the main hall tower. A further feature of the gardens to survive is a grade-II-listed sundial dating from the early 19th century, which stands to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E
30|$|There was no {{passage from}} <b>the</b> front to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> support. Because <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> link bar was fixed in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> support base, {{operators}} {{could not go}} through two supports from <b>the</b> front to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> support. The only way {{was to go to}} <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> support via face ends, which resulted in difficulties in terms of safety and maintenance.|$|R
50|$|A {{group of}} pencil pines create an avenue toward the {{memorial}} {{and a number}} of Gallipoli pines are located to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure. Flag poles are also located to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> memorial.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} is <b>of</b> face brick with supporting piers and barred windows.

25|$|In 1844 or 1845, {{after her}} return to the Cutts–Madison House, arsonists put lit matches into the {{shutters}} in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> and Dolley Madison had to be wakened and saved from death by a servant. The fire was quickly put out, and {{the damage to the}} building not extensive (Mrs. Madison returned to her bedroom the same night).|$|E
25|$|The National Archive Building is a two-storeyed {{houses of}} almost exact replicas of its Dutch counterpart. The Dutch {{influence}} {{can be seen in}} the hipped roof, closed and solidly built facade, and high windows. The only concession to the tropical climate is the relatively large roof overhang compared with the original Dutch country houses. Also, unlike their Dutch counterparts, the National Archive Building contains an extensive ancillary quarters at <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> to accommodate the large number of slaves to accommodate the wealthy lifestyle of the residents. It also had godowns for the storage of goods acquired through private trading ventures.|$|E

25|$|When Joseph W. Taylor {{purchased}} 40 {{acres of}} land for the campus of Bryn Mawr College in 1878, three Victorian cottages were located on the property, later known as the Deanery, the Betweenery, and the Greenery. In 1885, M. Carey Thomas moved into the Deanery, a modest building of five rooms situated downhill and approximately 100 meters (330 feet) {{to the west of}} what was then the central campus building, Taylor Hall. The residence underwent a minor expansion in 1888 – the first of three renovations – when two small rooms were added to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> for the storage of books and records.|$|E
25|$|Whereas most {{dwellings}} in Madagascar {{are traditionally}} constructed from pliable plant materials, the Antandroy {{are one of}} the few ethnic groups to use wood plank to build their homes. Antandroy homes are traditionally square (not rectangular, as elsewhere on the island), raised on low stilts, topped with a peaked roof and constructed of vertically-hung planks of wood affixed to a wooden frame. These houses traditionally have no windows and feature three wooden doors: the front door is the women's entrance, the door at <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is for children, and the third door is used by the men. Fences are often constructed around Antandroy houses using prickly-pear cactus (raketa) or lengths of indigenous succulents from the surrounding spiny forests.|$|E
25|$|During the shootout, police {{continued}} to fire dozens of tear-gas grenades into the home, trying {{to flush out}} the SLA members. About two hours into the shootout, the house caught fire, probably due to an exploding tear gas canister. As the house began to burn, two women left from <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and one came out the front (she had come in drunk the previous night, passed out, and woken {{up in the middle}} of the siege); all were taken into custody, but were found not to be SLA members. Automatic weapons fire continued from the house. At this point, Nancy Ling Perry and Camilla Hall came out of the house. Investigators working for their parents would claim that they walked out intending to surrender and that they were unarmed but police later stated that Hall was shot in the head by police as she aimed a weapon towards them while Perry was providing covering fire. After Hall's body fell to the ground, it was pulled back inside the burning house by Angela Atwood. Perry followed Hall out of the house, firing a pistol at officers as she emerged, and was shot twice in the back. Her body remained outside the house.|$|E
50|$|New {{landscaping}} surrounds <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, whilst <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site is asphalted {{for use as}} a carpark.

Access to the former generator building was limited to a narrow walkway that leads to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. The former generator building is a three-storey structure with a concrete floor covering part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first floor level. The building contains <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power plant, including steel pipes, fans and fluming.|$|R
