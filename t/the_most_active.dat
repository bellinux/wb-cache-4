In the Philippines, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>active</b> season, since 1945, for tropical cyclone strikes was 1993 when nineteen tropical cyclones moved through the country. There was only one tropical cyclone that moved through the Philippines in 1958. The 2004 Pacific typhoon season was the busiest for Okinawa since 1957.

5|$|Nearly {{one-third of}} the world's {{tropical}} cyclones form within the western Pacific. This makes this basin <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>active</b> on Earth. Pacific typhoons have formed year round, with peak months from August to October. The peak months correspond {{to that of the}} Atlantic hurricane seasons. Along with a high storm frequency, this basin also features the most globally intense storms on record. One of the most recent busy seasons was 2013. Tropical cyclones form in any month of the year across the northwest Pacific Ocean, and concentrate around June and November in the northern Indian Ocean. The area just northeast of the Philippines is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>active</b> place on Earth for tropical cyclones to exist. Across the Philippines themselves, activity reaches a minimum in February, before increasing steadily through June, and spiking from July through October, with September being <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>active</b> month for tropical cyclones across the archipelago. Activity falls off significantly in November, although Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest Philippine typhoon on record, was a November typhoon. The most frequently impacted areas of the Philippines by tropical cyclones are northern and central Luzon and eastern Visayas. A ten-year average of satellite determined precipitation showed that at least 30percent of the annual rainfall in the northern Philippines could be traced to tropical cyclones, while the southern islands receive less than 10percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones. The genesis and intensity of typhoons are also modulated by slow variation of the sea surface temperature and circulation features following a near-10-year frequency.|$|E

It has also been accused of harming the environment, particularly by causing soil contamination. Sitakunda's ecosystems are further threatened by deforestation, over-fishing, and groundwater contamination.
