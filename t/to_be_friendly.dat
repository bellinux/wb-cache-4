5|$|Mrs. Puff is SpongeBob's {{paranoid}} driving {{teacher and}} the owner of the town boating school, which is similar to a driver's education facility. She would like nothing more than to pass SpongeBob, as he is her most dedicated and hard-working student, but he routinely panics when he tries to drive a boat and fails every driving test he takes. His failures often result in crashes that lead to mass destruction and endanger Mrs. Puff. While she tries her best <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> and patient with her students, Mrs. Puff finds SpongeBob's unintentional recklessness exasperating. She is the long-standing love interest and girlfriend of Mr. Krabs.|$|E
5|$|I {{saw them}} as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be perfect for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression {{that would be used}} against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to those who want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friendly.</b> But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the breed}} {{are not usually}} ridden until they are four years old, and {{structural}} development is not complete until age seven. Their most productive years are between eight and eighteen, although they retain their strength and stamina into their twenties. An Icelandic mare that lived in Denmark reached a record age of 56, while another horse, living in Great Britain, {{reached the age of}} 42. The horses are highly fertile, and both sexes are fit for breeding up to age 25; mares have been recorded giving birth at age 27. The horses tend to not be easily spooked, probably the result of not having any natural predators in their native Iceland. Icelandics tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friendly,</b> docile and easy to handle, although also enthusiastic and self-assured. As a result of their isolation from other horses, disease in the breed within Iceland is mostly unknown, except for some kinds of internal parasites. The low prevalence of disease in Iceland is maintained by laws preventing horses exported from the country being returned, and by requiring that all equine equipment taken into the country be either new and unused or fully disinfected. As a result, native horses have no acquired immunity to disease; an outbreak on the island would be likely to be devastating to the breed. This presents problems with showing native Icelandic horses against others of the breed from outside the country, as no livestock of any species can be imported into Iceland, and once horses leave the country they are not allowed to return.|$|E

25|$|The partisans {{operated}} under constant threat of starvation. In order to survive, Jews {{had to put}} aside traditional dietary restrictions.

25|$|As {{with most}} urban districts, Colorado's 1st Congressional District is racially diverse and has proven <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> {{territory}} for Democrats.

Gillespie was the district's representative from 1944 to 1947, and Mike McKevitt served one term from 1970 to 1972, winning thanks to an ideological split among Denver Democrats.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Brătianu's {{had been}} {{replaced}} with the crisis government of General Alexandru Averescu, and this was soon followed by Alexandru Marghiloman's (chosen to negotiate the peace, as the German Empire was thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> towards Marghiloman). Nonetheless, Romania never did ratify the signed treaty, and denounced it in October 1918, immediately re-entering the conflict on the Entente's side. In November, the Compiègne armistice with Germany removed all legal value of the Bucharest Treaty.|$|E
25|$|The rebels {{encountered}} little resistance at {{the start}} of the attack on Saigon, and this allowed them to generate momentum. This was primarily to Diệm and Nhu's complacency and mistaken assumption that the military action was the start of Operation Bravo. The central police called Diệm, informing him that the marines did not appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friendly.</b> It was too late as the rebels captured the police headquarters and shut down the secret police, which were directly controlled by Nhu.|$|E

His kind-heartedness means he goes out of his way <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> to Eeyore, visiting him and bringing him a birthday present and building him a house, despite receiving mostly disdain from Eeyore in return.|$|E
25|$|Although Oswald Garrison Villard's 1910 {{biography}} of Brown was thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> (Villard being {{the grandson of}} abolitionist Garrison), he also added fuel to the anti-Brown fire by criticizing him as a muddled, pugnacious, bumbling, and homicidal madman. Villard himself was a pacifist and admired Brown in many respects, but his interpretation of the facts provided a paradigm for later anti-Brown writers. By the mid-20th century, some scholars were fairly convinced that John Brown was a fanatic and killer, while some African Americans sustained a positive view of the man.|$|E
25|$|Diệm {{rejected}} these moderate policies, {{believing that}} a militantly anti-Communist stance was the solution for South Vietnam. This {{coincided with a}} fact finding mission by Democratic Party U.S. Senator Mike Mansfield, a Roman Catholic and strong Diệm supporter, who advocated a suspension of U.S. aid if Diệm were removed. L'Express, the newspaper in Paris which printed his ideas, was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> with French Prime Minister Pierre Mendès France. As a result, the US State Department interpreted it as a French manoevre to replace Diệm with Hội. Strongly disapproving of Hội's foreign policies, the State Department warned Mendes-France that U.S. policy would change if Hội became Prime Minister.|$|E

25|$|The Anglo-Soviet {{invasion}} of Iran, {{also known as}} Anglo-Soviet {{invasion of}} Persia, was {{the invasion of the}} Empire of Iran during the Second World War by Soviet, British and other Commonwealth armed forces. The invasion lasted from 25 August to 17 September 1941 and was codenamed Operation Countenance. Its purpose was to secure Iranian oil fields and ensure Allied supply lines (see Persian Corridor) for the USSR, fighting against Axis forces on the Eastern Front. Though Iran was neutral, the Allies considered Reza Shah <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> to the Axis powers, deposed him during the subsequent occupation and replaced him with his young son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.|$|E
25|$|Professor George Buchanan Gray of Mansfield College, Oxford, in {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, wrote that the Israelite men's {{participation}} in the sacrificial feasts followed their intimacy with the women, who then naturally invited their paramours to their feasts, which, according to custom, were sacrificial occasions. Gray considered {{that it would have}} been in accord with the sentiment of early Israelites to worship the Moabite god on his own territory. Similalry, Professor Frymer-Kensky of Chicago University wrote that the cataclysm began with a dinner invitation from the Moabite women, who perhaps wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> with the people whom Balaam had tried, but failed, to curse.|$|E
25|$|In October 1806 Ball sent Spencer to {{negotiate}} with the Dey of Algiers for the release of some Maltese whom the Algerians had enslaved before Malta became a British possession. As Spencer was about to leave, his mission unsuccessful, the Dey, expressing his wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> with Britain, released 30 men and two ladies who had been slaves for more than 15 years. He also requested that a British frigate come to take his ambassador to Constantinople. On Spencer's return, the Government of Malta presented him with a piece of plate valued at 100 guineas. At a later date, Spencer received a second piece of plate, this one worth 40 guineas, in appreciation of his efforts to protect Malta's trade.|$|E
