50|$|As expected, {{the engines}} were more {{powerful}} than the Whittle design, first delivering 1,800 lbf (8 kN) but soon scaling up to well over 2,000 lbf (8.9 kN). Around this time, the Whittle W.2B was developing 1,600 lbf (7.11 kN). However, the F.2 engine suffered from a number of problems that cast doubts on its reliability. These were primarily due to hot spots building up on the <b>turbine</b> <b>bearing</b> and combustion chamber. The latter, in turn, caused warping and fractures of the turbine inlet nozzles.|$|E
5000|$|F136 funding came at {{the expense}} of other program elements, {{impacting}} on unit costs. The F136 team stated their engine had a greater temperature margin, potentially critical for VTOL operations in hot, high altitude conditions. Pratt & Whitney tested higher thrust versions of the F135, partly in response to GE's statements that the F136 is capable of producing more thrust than the 43000 lbf kN of early F135s. In testing, the F135 has demonstrated a maximum thrust of over 50000 lbf kN; making it the most powerful engine ever installed in a fighter aircraft as of 2010. It is much heavier than previous fighter engines; the Heavy Underway Replenishment system needed to transfer the F135 between ships is an unfunded USN requirement. Thermoelectric-powered sensors monitor <b>turbine</b> <b>bearing</b> health. [...] At the end of May 2017 Pratt and Whitney announced the F135 Growth Option 1 had finished testing and was available for production. The upgrade requires the changing of the power module on older engines and can be seamlessly inserted into future production engines at a minimal increase in unit cost and no impact to delivery schedule. The Growth Option 1 offers a improvement of 6-10% thrust across the F-35 flight envelope while also getting a 5-6% fuel burn reduction.|$|E
40|$|Offshore wind {{turbines}} often involve important engineering challenges {{such as the}} improvement of hydrogen embrittlement resistance of the <b>turbine</b> <b>bearings.</b> These elements frequently suffer the so-called phenomenon of hydrogen-assisted rolling-contact fatigue (HA-RCF) {{as a consequence of}} the synergic action of the surrounding harsh environment (the lubricant) supplying hydrogen to the material and the cyclic multiaxial stress state caused by in-service mechanical loading. Thus the complex phenomenon could be classified as hydrogen-assisted rolling-contact multiaxial fatigue (HA-RC-MF). This paper analyses, from the mechanical and the chemical points of view, the so-called ball-on-rod test, widely used to evaluate the hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of <b>turbine</b> <b>bearings.</b> Both the stress-strain states and the steady-state hydrogen concentration distribution are studied, so that a better elucidation can be obtained of the potential fracture places where the hydrogen could be more harmful and, consequently, where the <b>turbine</b> <b>bearings</b> could fail during their life in service...|$|R

Other uses include marine drive shaft <b>bearings,</b> <b>turbine</b> housing <b>bearings,</b> pump and pressure system bearings, shaft end-float, flatness and clearance in pipe-flanges and cylinder heads. Wherever it is required to determine the separation between hidden surfaces. Plastigauge was introduced to US retail sales in 1948.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} identify a bearing fault on a wind turbine, a novel fault diagnosis method based on stochastic subspace identification (SSI) and multi-kernel {{support vector machine}} (MSVM) is proposed. First, the collected vibration signal of the wind <b>turbine</b> <b>bearing</b> is processed by the SSI method to extract fault feature vectors. Then, the MSVM is constructed based on Gauss kernel support vector machine (SVM) and polynomial kernel SVM. Finally, fault feature vectors which indicate {{the condition of the}} wind <b>turbine</b> <b>bearing</b> are inputted to the MSVM for fault pattern recognition. The results indicate that the SSI-MSVM method is effective in fault diagnosis for a wind <b>turbine</b> <b>bearing</b> and can successfully identify fault types of bearing and achieve higher diagnostic accuracy than that of K-means clustering, fuzzy means clustering and traditional SVM.|$|E

40|$|Investigation {{showed that}} the <b>turbine</b> front <b>bearing</b> has failed by true {{brinelling}} followed by severe spalling on the inner raceway. The most probable reason for such failure appears to be excessive load on the balls arising from the misalignment of the bearing. The cause for the misalignment is uncertain {{and needs to be}} determined to prevent recurrence of similar failure. The microstructure and hardness of outer/inner ring and the balls were found to be in the normal range of high carbon bearing steel. There were no damages in the <b>turbine</b> rear <b>bearing.</b> ...|$|R

30|$|The results {{indicate}} that the SSI-MSVM method is an effective fault diagnosis method for a wind <b>turbine</b> <b>bearing,</b> and can successfully identify fault types of bearing and achieve higher diagnostic accuracy than that of K-means clustering, FCM and traditional SVM.|$|E
30|$|SSI analysis. First, the {{collected}} vibration signal {{is used to}} construct a stochastic state-space model of a wind <b>turbine</b> <b>bearing</b> as shown in (1).

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel fault diagnosis method for a wind <b>turbine</b> <b>bearing</b> based on SSI and MSVM. The SSI method directly constructs a model based on time-domain data and {{can identify the}} mode parameters. This is suitable for extracting the fault features. The MSVM is an improved mode recognition method which combines the Gauss kernel SVM and the polynomial kernel SVM, so it can identify the fault types of bearing more accurately.|$|E
50|$|The Clyde {{was a long}} engine {{with the}} axial LP {{compressor}} in front of what was, in effect, a scaled-down Derwent engine. Accessories were grouped around the axial compressor which conveniently narrowed towards the rear. Cooling for <b>turbines</b> and <b>turbine</b> <b>bearings</b> came from a small diffuser on the main shaft as well as tappings from the axial and centrifugal compressors. Testing of the development engines exceeded expectations with the engine soon being rated at 4,030 eshp. One problem un-earthed during testing was that damaging resonances emanated from the straight-cut spur gears in the reduction gearbox.|$|R

30|$|Recent decades {{renewable}} energy sources have received increasingly wide attention. As {{one of the most}} promising new clean {{renewable energy}} sources, wind power generation is in large-scale development around the world [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, wind turbines are prone to various failures due to long-term operation under tough conditions, complex alternating loads and variable speeds [5]. The bearing is a critical component of a wind turbine and bearing failures form a significant proportion of all failures in wind turbines. These, can lead to outage of the unit and a high maintenance cost [6, 7]. Hence, the development of an accurate fault diagnosis method for wind <b>turbine</b> <b>bearing</b> would be extremely valuable for improving safety and economy.|$|E

Basically, the anomaly detection algorithm {{is used to}} recognize the presence of unusual and potentially faulty data in a dataset, which contains two phases: a training phase and a testing phase. Two bearing datasets were used to validate the proposed technique, fault-seeded bearing from a test rig located at Case Western Reserve University to validate {{the accuracy of the}} anomaly detection method, and a test to failure data of bearings from the NSF I/UCR Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS).

40|$|AbstractDifficult-to-cut {{materials}} like Inconel 718 {{are used}} for aerospace, steam <b>turbine,</b> <b>bearing</b> industry, nuclear and automotive applications. In machining, friction and heat generation at the cutting zone are the frequent problems, which affect the tool life and surface finish. Heat generation pose limitations during the turning of such modern materials due to their peculiar characteristics such as poor thermal conductivity, high strength at elevated temperature, resistance to wear and chemical degradation. A good understanding of the methods of lubrication/cooling at the cutting zone, reduction of heat generation will lead to efficient and economic machining of these modern materials. This paper presents use of compressed cold carbon dioxide for cooling at machined affected zone. Effect of cold compressed carbon dioxide as coolant on process forces, surface roughness, micro hardness, specific cutting pressure has been studied in comparison to dry turning for same set of cutting parameters...|$|E
40|$|Premature wind <b>turbine</b> gearbox <b>bearing</b> {{failures}} {{in the form of}} white structure flaking (WSF) can occur in as little as 6 â€“ 24 months of operation. WSF is not fully understood but is thought to be due to hydrogen release and diffusion into the bearing steel and/or transient operating conditions not fully understood. The initiation mechanisms of white etching cracks (WECs) are contested, where amongst others mechanisms, subsurface initiation at non-metallic inclusions (perhaps associated with extension of butterfly cracks) and surface crack initiation are cited. For the first time this study applies serial sectioning to map WEC networks in wind <b>turbine</b> gearbox <b>bearings</b> to elucidate WEC initiation mechanisms. A comparison is made between WEC data for inner rings of an industrial transient test gearbox bearing and a planet bearing that spalled in service. It is proposed that one mechanism of WEC formation in wind <b>turbine</b> gearbox <b>bearings</b> is due to subsurface WEC initiation from inclusions, either in a butterfly manner or non-butterfly manner; where these small WECs link together to form larger WEC networks, these eventually propagating to the surface resulting in WSF. Small size/length inclusions were found to be likely WEC initiators, therefore the data suggests that steel cleanliness standards analysing inclusion density (as opposed to maximum inclusion lengths) are more relevant in understanding butterfly/WEC initiation in wind <b>turbine</b> gearbox <b>bearings.</b> However standards used should be able to differentiate pure sulfides from sulfides+oxide encapsulations and record inclusions that are only a couple of mircometerâ€™s in length/diameter. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The oil and {{air flows}} in bearing {{chambers}} {{can influence the}} performance and capabilities of turbine engines, the maintenance requirements, and the maintenance schedule. Unfortunately, little research effort has been dedicated to the flow physics inside gas <b>turbine</b> <b>bearing</b> chambers. One major issue concerning bearing chambers is poor drainage. Poor drainage {{can be caused by}} leaky seals or ill-designed sumps. Poor drainage can reduce the effectiveness and lifetime of the cooling oil that is injected into the chamber. This research addresses the issue by conducting various experiments on sump designs. The experiments include identifying the flow physics, minor changes to the design to improve performance, and a major change to the design to address issues that cannot be satisfied by the minor modifications. A flow rig that can accommodate various sump designs has been built. A new advanced sump has been built with features to address various issues with the old standard sump design. Early tests showed that the advanced sump design performs better than the old sump. Additional experiments, design modifications, and validations were conducted to further improve the new design. ...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 1 - 8 A new {{cogeneration}} installation was in {{the process}} of being commissioned when severe subsynchronous vibration was detected on the generator during no load tests. Subsequently, two rotordynamics problems were discovered. These problems prohibited the steam turbine generator set from reaching full speed. Additional vibration problems were anticipated once the generator was loaded and the steam flows through the turbines increased. The first subsynchronous vibration problem, observed during initial full speed, no-load run attempts, was found to be most severe at the inboard generator bearing and the adjacent <b>turbine</b> <b>bearing.</b> The second problem, uncovered during analysis of the generator vibration problem, was the presence of low-level subsynchronous vibration at a different frequency on both bearings of the high pressure-intermediate pressure (HP-IP) turbine rotor. The concern was that this vibration would be exacerbated once the machine was loaded and additional aerodynamic cross-coupling was introduced by steam flow at seal and wheel locations. This paper detailed the discovery of the problems, initial attempts to address them, and the use of rotordynamics tool to engineer a solution to the problems by the design, manufacture, and installation of optimized bearings...|$|E
