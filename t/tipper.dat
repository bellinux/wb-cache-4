3000|$|First, we {{illustrate}} {{the significance of}} the ocean induction effect by calculating <b>tippers</b> for a model with ocean plus a homogeneous Earth model (HOM) of ρ = 100 Ωm (dashed gray line in Fig.  2 a). Without ocean induction effect, such a model would result in zero <b>tippers.</b> However, modeled <b>tippers</b> are significant as shown by dashed blue and red lines in Fig.  2 b. Next, we choose a 1 -D conductivity profile that is varying with depth, as indicated by the red line in Fig.  2 a. The crosses in Fig.  2 b show the resulting <b>tippers</b> which differ significantly from those corresponding to the HOM. This result confirms that <b>tippers</b> are sensitive to the underlying 1 -D conductivity structure, as has been shown by Samrock and Kuvshinov (2013). Next, we add 3 [...]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A mine having five {{quarries}} {{needs at}} least 10 <b>tippers</b> out of 17 {{to be in}} running condition for a particular shift. However, with the poor availability of the <b>tippers,</b> the produc-tion was hampered. Substantial improvement of availability and utilisation of <b>tippers</b> under the existing infrastructure of the system was of primary concern to the plant management. Performance of all the <b>tippers</b> was evaluated through Mean Time-to-Failure (MTTF) and Mean Down Time (MDT) including the overall system performance. Based on Weibull(b, c) and Exponential(λ) distributions, the reliability of all the <b>tippers</b> (component reliability) along with the overall system reliability with respect to 10 -out-of- 17 structure was computed. Next, <b>tippers</b> were clustered, using k-means clustering algorithm, and the group reliabilities were ob-tained which led to different options for improving the overall system’s reliability. The Pareto Principle was adopted to identify dominant failure modes. Using the matrix of interrelation-ship, five failure modes {{were found to be}} self-inducing in nature. The minimum number of repairmen required to keep the desired number of <b>tippers</b> running with a certain probability was determined, through simulation technique, using the classical repairmen model. The net effect of implementation of suitable preventive maintenance activities along with overhauling...|$|R

25|$|Due to {{the issues}} found with the distractor {{inhibition}} model, <b>Tipper</b> and Houghton modified the distractor inhibition model to account for long-term negative priming effects. The original inhibition account proposed that inhibition occurs only when the distractors are suppressed. The Houghton–Tipper model revised this proposition and claims that inhibition occurs during both the encoding of distractors and the retrieval of that memory. The main reason for this change is to explain the long-term negative priming and justify it using the new combined model. When a repeated distractor becomes the target, processing of this stimulus automatically retrieves {{the memory of the}} stimulus being inhibited as a distractor. This model suggests that inhibition occurs when ignoring the distractor and during the memory retrieval of the previous ignorance of the stimulus. Therefore, it incorporates the inhibition account in selective attention and the episode retrieval model.|$|E

25|$|The most {{successful}} freight service was the uncrushed ballast service. Following withdrawal of War Department operations over their siding near Maddieson's Camp, the railway utilised the infrastructure to operate ballast trains. In 1937 a subsidiary ballast company was formed. <b>Tipper</b> wagons (skips) were loaded with shingle and transported along the branch line {{and then up}} the main line to Hythe, often lying over in the sidings at Dymchurch to prevent delay to passenger trains using the same tracks. At Hythe the wagons were originally pushed by the locomotive up a concrete ramp and the wagons tipped into a large concrete holding bin or directly into waiting lorries, a precarious practice which was later replaced by mechanical haulage up the ramp. After the war the Hythe workings were cut back and the wagons were unloaded in a siding (in what is now New Romney station car park), the remnant of which is now used for loading coal into loco tenders. This practice didn't last long and a purpose built siding and ramp was installed south of New Romney on the Dungeness line. The fence line can still be seen. In 1951, after 14 years, the subsidiary company switched to entirely road transport and the company closed the branch and the freight incline. At Hythe, the concrete pillars were still visible until the early 1980s when they were demolished to allow access to the car park extension along the former platform 4 and engine release siding.|$|E
30|$|To our knowledge, <b>tippers</b> {{estimated}} at geomagnetic observatories {{have not been}} used for studying 1 -D electrical conductivity distributions. However, <b>tippers</b> dominated by 3 -D effects such as bathymetry also contain information on the vertical conductivity profile (Berdichevsky and Dmitriev 2008; Samrock and Kuvshinov 2013). In consequence, if the 3 -D effects are known, the 1 -D conductivity profile can be extracted.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we go a {{step further}} and develop a {{methodology}} to invert island <b>tippers</b> for a 1 -D conductivity distribution in the presence of known 3 -D bathymetry. Using this methodology, we first perform realistic synthetic tests and demonstrate that <b>tippers</b> from a single island observatory are indeed able to recover the synthetic 1 -D conductivity profile. Then, we invert <b>tippers</b> obtained at two island observatories located in different tectonic environments, namely Gan (GAN) in the Indian Ocean and Tristan da Cunha (TDC) in the South Atlantic. Finally, we interpret the recovered 1 -D profiles in terms of their regional geology and discuss the caveats of the 1 -D assumption at remote oceanic islands.|$|R

25|$|Vanderbilt has {{approximately}} 139,000 living alumni, with 38 alumni clubs established worldwide. Many Vanderbilt alumni {{have gone}} on to make significant contributions in politics. Lamar Alexander (B.A. 1962) is a current U.S. Senator, former Governor of Tennessee, former U.S. Secretary of Education, and former U.S. presidential candidate; he filled the Senate seat left vacant by the retirement of Fred Thompson (J.D. 1971). There has been at least one Vanderbilt graduate occupying a U.S. Senate seat for Tennessee since 1977. Other alumni who are current members of Congress include John Neely Kennedy (B.A. 1973), a Senator from Louisiana; French Hill (B.S. 1978), a Representative from Arkansas; Luke Messer (J.D. 1994), a Representative from Indiana; Leonard Lance (J.D. 1977), a Representative from New Jersey; and Steve Cohen (B.A. 1971), a Representative from Tennessee. Additionally, Greg Abbott, the 48th and current Governor of Texas, received his law degree from Vanderbilt in 1984. Two U.S. vice presidents, John Nance Garner and Al Gore, attended the university, but did not graduate. However, Gore's ex-wife, <b>Tipper,</b> is herself an alumna, receiving a master's degree from Peabody in 1975. In total, Vanderbilt has graduated 12 current and former governors and 21 current and former Congressmen. Other alumni who are or have been involved in politics include former United States Supreme Court Associate Justice and former Attorney General James Clark McReynolds (B.S. 1882), Executive Vice President of the Cato Institute David Boaz (B.A. 1975),, White House Chief of Staff John R. Steelman (M.A. 1924), Civil Rights Movement activist James Lawson (M.Div. 1960), and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Mickey Kantor (B.A. 1951). Bill Frist, a cardiothoracic surgeon and former U.S. Senate Majority Leader, is a faculty member at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Hiram Wesley Evans, who served as the Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan from 1922 to 1939, was also a Vanderbilt graduate. Floyd M. Riddick, a master's alum, served as Parliamentarian of the United States Senate. Five leaders in foreign government are alumni. Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, former Prime Minister of Somalia and current President of Puntland received his master's degree from Vanderbilt; Chung Won-shik, former Prime Minister of South Korea, is a master's and doctorate alum; Yeda Crusius, former governor of the Brazilian state Rio Grande do Sul, received a master's degree in economics from Vanderbilt; Redley A. Killion, former Vice President of Micronesia, and Pedro Pinto Rubianes, former Vice President of Ecuador, are both Vanderbilt master's alums. Vanderbilt is also represented in other leadership positions in foreign nations. Abdallah Kigoda, a master's alum, served as the Minister of Industry and Trade of Tanzania; Süreyya Serdengeçti, a master's alum, is a former Governor of the Central Bank of Turkey; and Kwon Hyouk-se is the current governor of the Financial Supervisory Service of South Korea.|$|E
