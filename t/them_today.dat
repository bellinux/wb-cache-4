5|$|Following {{the general}} custom of Europe {{in the late}} {{classical}} and early Middle Ages, he was popularly recognised after his death as a saint, along with several hundred other Welsh men and women. But the date and circumstances of {{the foundation of the}} church, and of Padarn's life were long forgotten when it was decided in the twelfth century that he should be commemorated in a Vita or Latin Life, following the example of the Life of St David written at Llanbadarn about 1090. That in turn had followed a European tradition of writing such lives. They are not biographies as we understand <b>them</b> <b>today.</b> Instead they were hagiographies, designed to elevate the saint’s status as a holy person of miraculous achievements.|$|E
5|$|In physics, mirror {{symmetry}} {{is justified}} on physical grounds. However, mathematicians generally require rigorous proofs {{that do not}} require an appeal to physical intuition. From a mathematical point of view, the version of mirror symmetry described above is still only a conjecture, but there is another version of mirror symmetry in the context of topological string theory, a simplified version of string theory introduced by Edward Witten, which has been rigorously proven by mathematicians. In the context of topological string theory, mirror symmetry states that two theories called the A-model and B-model are equivalent in the sense that there is a duality relating <b>them.</b> <b>Today</b> mirror symmetry is an active area of research in mathematics, and mathematicians are working to develop a more complete mathematical understanding of mirror symmetry based on physicists' intuition.|$|E
5|$|Biological control {{techniques}} {{as we know}} <b>them</b> <b>today</b> started {{to emerge in the}} 1870s. During this decade, in the USA, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites Tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight the grapevine phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid Cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, {{but by the end of}} 1889 the cottony cushion scale population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.|$|E

5|$|Many {{endemic species}} of Mauritius became extinct after {{the arrival of}} humans, so the {{ecosystem}} of the island is badly damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, but very little remains of <b>them</b> <b>today,</b> because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The dodo lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the flightless red rail, the broad-billed parrot, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the Mauritius night heron. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise, the domed Mauritius giant tortoise, the Mauritian giant skink, and the Round Island burrowing boa. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Mauritius and Réunion, but vanished from both islands. Some plants, such as Casearia tinifolia and the palm orchid, have also become extinct.|$|E

25|$|Hernan Cortés wrote, in a 1520 letter, {{that the}} Aztecs raised {{and sold the}} little dogs as food. Small dogs such as Chihuahuas were also used as living hot-water bottles during illness or injury.

25|$|The Great Lakes are {{estimated}} to have been formed {{at the end of}} the last glacial period (the Wisconsin glaciation ended 10,000 to 12,000 years ago), when the Laurentide Ice Sheet receded. The retreat of the ice sheet left behind a large amount of meltwater (see Lake Algonquin and Lake Chicago) that filled up the basins that the glaciers had carved, thus creating the Great Lakes as we know <b>them</b> <b>today.</b> Because of the uneven nature of glacier erosion, some higher hills became Great Lakes islands. The Niagara Escarpment follows the contour of the Great Lakes between New York and Wisconsin. See also Glacial Lake Iroquois and Champlain Sea.|$|E
25|$|Breeds {{as we know}} <b>them</b> <b>today</b> did {{not exist}} before Victorian times, but local {{variations}} of the ancestors of current breeds came into America along with their owners and livestock. Included are some that are now extinct or that have merged into other breeds. These may have included some British herding dogs, native dogs from North America (originating in Asia/Siberia), as well as dogs from Germany and Spain including the Carea Leonés. For many centuries, shepherds {{were more interested in}} dogs' working abilities than their appearance. As a result, over time, shepherds interbred dogs that they believed would produce better workers for the given climate and landscape. In the eastern U.S., terrain and weather conditions were similar to that of Europe, so the existing imported breeds and their offspring worked well there.|$|E
25|$|The sea {{made one}} more {{important}} intrusion into West Virginia during Middle Mississippian time, approximately 330 million years ago, {{resulting in the}} deposition of the Greenbrier Formation, predominantly limestone, the last marine deposit of significance in the State.

Early in the succeeding Pennsylvanian Period, the area dropped to near sea level and for more than 50 million years continued to sink {{at about the same}} rate that deposition was taking place. Permian Period, roughly 270 to 225 million years ago, the Appalachian Orogeny began which played a major part {{in the formation of the}} Appalachian Mountains as we know <b>them</b> <b>today.</b> Never again has the sea invaded West Virginia.|$|E

25|$|The Maya {{writing system}} {{consists}} of about 1000 distinct characters or hieroglyphs ('glyphs'), {{and like many}} ancient writing systems {{is a mixture of}} syllabic signs and logograms. This script was in use from the 3rd century BCE until shortly after the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. As of now (2017), a considerable proportion of the characters has a reading, but their meaning and configuration as a text is not always understood. The books were folded and consisted of bark paper or leather leaves with an adhesive stucco layer on which to write; they were protected by jaguar skin covers or, perhaps, wooden boards. Since every diviner probably needed a book, there must have existed large numbers of <b>them.</b> <b>Today,</b> three codices (the Dresden, Paris, and Madrid codices), all of the Post-Classic period, are still in existence; the authenticity of a fourth one (the Grolier Codex) is doubtful.

Great attention was paid to a harmonious balance of texts and (partly coloured) illustrations.|$|E
25|$|By the 11th century, Petatlán was {{inhabited}} by the Cuitlatecos, the Chumbias and the Pantecas. Many of these inhabitants migrated from the north, through Zacatula. The original settlement of Tecpan {{is thought to}} have been founded in 1326 by a Mexica tribe which migrated from the north. However, in the 14th century, much of the area, along with another Guerrero region called Tierra Caliente, came {{under the control of the}} Cuitlatecos, with their capital at Mezcaltepec. Other cultures in the area included the Tolimecas, Chubias, Coixas, Pantecas and Cuitlecas. The two largest settlements of this dominion were Cuitlatepan, near Zihuatanejo, and Petatlán. In the 15th century, both the rising Aztec Empire and Purépecha Empire were putting pressure onto the Cuitlateco dominion, which eventually brought it to an end. The Purépecha held some areas of the Costa Grande, including Zihuatanejo Bay, which was used as a kind of retreat on what is now Playa Las Gatas. The Aztecs took Cuitlatepan in 1497 and much of the rest of the Costa Grande by 1504, renaming Cuitlaetepan to Cihuatlán, and forming a tributary province which roughly coincides with the Costa Grande today. The Aztec conquest caused much of the population to flee and abandon the cities of Petatlán and Cihuatlán. For this reason, little remains of <b>them</b> <b>today.</b> Aztec control of the area was loose and some small areas still remained allied with the Purépecha.|$|E
