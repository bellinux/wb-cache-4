5|$|Since {{the film}} would not feature any songs, the {{directors}} hired James Newton Howard to compose the score. Approaching it as a live-action film, Howard decided <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>different</b> musical themes for {{the cultures of}} the surface world and Atlantis. In the case of Atlantis, Howard chose an Indonesian orchestral sound incorporating chimes, bells, and gongs. The directors told Howard that the film would {{have a number of}} key scenes without dialogue; the score would need to convey emotionally what the viewer was seeing on screen.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, because it {{is expected}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>different</b> electron charge densities from them. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 34.8g/cm3. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from darmstadtium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough darmstadtium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the T cell-mediated {{mechanism}} of mucosal destruction is strong, but the exact triggers for this process are unknown and {{are thought to}} be multiple and varied from one person to the next. This suggests {{that there are a number}} of possible triggers, each of which is capable of producing the disease in different subgroups. In other words, different subgroups appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>different</b> causes for the condition. These can be considered in three general groups, namely primary immuno-dysregulation, decrease of the mucosal barrier and states of heightened antigenic sensitivity (see below). Risk factors in aphthous stomatitis are also sometimes considered as either host-related or environmental.|$|E

5|$|For the {{hand-held}} camera footage, Soderbergh used Panavision Millennium XLs {{that were}} smaller and lighter than previous cameras and {{allowed him to}} move freely. In order to tell the three stories apart, he adopted a distinctive look for each. For Robert Wakefield's story, Soderbergh used tungsten film with no filter for a cold, monochrome blue feel. For Helena Ayala's story, Soderbergh used diffusion filters, flashing the film, overexposing it for a warmer feel. For Javier Rodriguez's story, the director used tobacco filters and a 45-degree shutter angle whenever possible to produce a strobe-like sharp feel. Then, he took the entire film through an Ektachrome step, which increased the contrast and grain significantly. He wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>different</b> looks for each story because the audience had {{to keep track of}} many characters and absorb a lot of information and he did not want them to have to figure out which story they were watching.|$|E
5|$|Roentgenium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, due to its being expected <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>different</b> electron charge densities from them. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 28.7g/cm3; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from roentgenium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough roentgenium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E

King or Hanneman used a 24-track and drum machine to show band members the riff that they created, {{and to get}} their opinion. Either King, Hanneman or Lombardo would mention if any alterations could be made. The band played the riff to get the basic song structure, and figured out where the lyrics and solos would be placed. Hanneman, King and Araya tended <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>different</b> lyrical influences. Hanneman's lyrics dealt with Nazis, religion, warfare and similar topics; King's lyrics are generally anti-religious; Araya's lyrics usually dealt with topics {{that could be considered}} less controversial than Hanneman's and King's, such as serial killers and warfare.|$|E

25|$|Different populations within Cape Dwarf Chameleons {{were found}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>different</b> {{preferences}} regarding Perch Diameter. The two main populations, Kogelberg and Stellenbosch, were seen <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>different</b> behavior. Kogelberg tended to use perches that were significantly wider on average than perches {{used by the}} Stellenbosch site which chose perches by random. Hand size has a direct correlation with grip strength on both broad and narrow dowels, rod-like structures, in both populations. The longer the tail length, the greater the strength. This species prefers to sleep on perches of specific diameters that correspond to their specific morphology. Animals from habitats characterized by wider perches are also stronger than their counterparts living in habitats with narrow branches. This has led to sexual selection for chameleons with specific traits like hand size and tail length.|$|E

25|$|Plants and {{photosynthetic}} bacteria naturally produce all-trans lycopene. When exposed to light or heat, lycopene can undergo isomerization {{to any of}} a number of cis-isomers, which have a bent rather than linear shape. Different isomers were shown <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>different</b> stabilities due to their molecular energy (highest stability: 5-cis ≥ all-trans ≥ 9-cis ≥ 13-cis > 15-cis > 7-cis > 11-cis: lowest).
