Four types of vegetable oils were used, and two fats of animal origin: olive oil, palm oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, lard and beef fat. Determined fat characteristics were: point of the saponification, the acid value, the ester value and the peroxide value. Submerged cultivation was performed on specially composed medium in which the oil or fat of choice, was mixed later. Lipolytic activity and biomass growth measurement was performed using spectrophotometry, lipid degradation ability was measured using titrimetry. Based on results it can be stated that tested microorganisms, originated from product, and its lipase has ability to successfully utilize all of used fats and oils and thus, theoretically, remove its content from grease trap...|$|E

This equipment can be operated {{at the rate of}} 150 liters per hour, and is of sanitary design and may be easily dismantled for cleaning. This equipment is arranged from three single unit, which descrived below: (1) Extractor This is designed to extract juice from all type of citrus fruits in a continuous process. Two endless wood chains are placed on a platform, retained by adjustable nuts, which allow the press to compensate for different thickness of the halved oranges. The halved oranges are carried between the two endless chains, on a lower chain and through continuous running ot the both, and here the juice is pressed from the oranges. The juice is collected in a stainless steel pan, from which it flow off to the finisher. This Extractors 2 ̆ 7 specification is as follow: Floor space 1. 550 m× 0. 510 m Over all height 1. 20 m Horse power 1 HP. Capacity per hour (approx.) 375 kg Pulley speed per minute upper endless wood chain 5 R. P. M lower endless wood chain 4 R. P. M (2) Deaerator The Deaerator is a stainless steel cylindrical vessel and contain an inner perforated cylinder, designed to spread the juice in the form of thin films and so increase the surface area exposed to vacuum. A vacuum pump is located at the point of connecting the deaeration chamber and the fram <b>trap</b> <b>vessel,</b> and provides a very high vacuum in the deaeration chamber. The raw juice is supplied into a deaeration chamber by vacuum suction, then the deaerated juice drops down into the downward storage tank, and is carried by the gear pump to the Flash Pasteurizer and the Cooler under atmospheric pressure.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the long-term natural history of focal confluent fibrosis in cirrhotic liver with CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two radiologists retrospectively reviewed in consensus 118 liver CT examinations in 26 patients (19 men, seven women; age range, 32 - 68 years; mean age, 50 years) performed over approximately 6 years. Helical CT scans were obtained before and 30 - 35 and 65 - 70 seconds after injection of 125 - 150 mL of contrast medium at a rate of 4 - 5 mL/s. Proof of cirrhosis was based on liver transplantation (n = 6), biopsy (n = 9), or imaging findings (n = 11). The number, location, and attenuation of fibrotic lesions and presence of <b>trapped</b> <b>vessels</b> were evaluated.

40|$|This work {{reflects}} {{the activities of}} line and trap fishing in Southern Mozambique in 2000. The catch in line fishing has been estimated at 441 mt, according to the DNAP records. The same sources indicated that 1767 days were spent at sea and the estimated catch rate was 250 Kg per boaticlay. Most of the line fishing effort shifted away from Maputo and moved to Inhambane region. The monthly analysis of fishing vessels, stricter controls over catch and effort data submission, development of long-term research programme and {{the continuation of the}} on board sampling to improve the data collection are the recommendation for line fishing. The catch of <b>trap</b> <b>vessels</b> increases from 30 mt in 1997 to 172 mt in 2000, during which the total number of traps increased from 25 to 300. During this time the number of fishing days has remained relatively constant, as well the soak time. These data sets are thus not compatible with each other, reflecting an increase in daily catch from 243 Kg to 791 kg.

From 1988 through 1989, I sampled 924 Pacific hagfish and 897 black hagfish from commercial and research catches. Mean length of fish sampled from commercial landings was 39. 6 cmf or Pacific hagfish and 34. 5 cm for black hagfish. Weight-length relationships (W=aLb) were calculated for males and females of both species. Fifty percent maturity for male and female Pacific hagfish was 35 cm and 42 cm, respectively, while 50 % maturityf or male and female black hagfish was 34 cm and 38 cm, respectively. Examination of gonads for both species indicated that spawning either occurs throughout the year or the spawning period is protracted. Mature females of both species had from one to three distinct sizes of eggs, but they usually carried only one group of eggs over 5 mm in length. Mature Pacific hagfish females averaged 28 eggs over 5 mm in length, and black hagfish females averaged 14 eggs over 5 mm in length.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of complex intracranial aneurysms remains a therapeutic challenge. These lesions are frequently not amenable to selective clipping or coiling or other endovascular procedures and surgery {{still has a}} predominant role. We illustrate our “surgical decision making” for managing complex intracranial aneurysmal lesions. The best strategy is decided {{on the basis of}} pre-operative neuroradiological and intra-operative main determinants such as anatomical location, peri-aneurysmal angioanatomy (branch vessels, critical perforators), broad neck, intraluminal thrombosis, aneurysmal wall atherosclerotic plaques and calcifications, absence of collateral circulation, and previous treatment. The surgical strategy encompasses one of the following treatment possibilities: (1) Direct clip reconstruction; (2) Complete trapping (“classic” or “variant”); (3) Partial trapping (proximal “inflow” or distal “outflow” occlusion). Because the goal of any aneurysm treatment is both (1) aneurysm exclusion and (2) blood flow replacement, cerebral revascularization represents a major management option whenever definitive or temporary vessel occlusion is needed. Cerebral revascularization can therefore be used temporarily as a “protective” bypass, or definitively as a “flow replacement” bypass. Complete and partial trapping strategies are associated with flow “replacement” bypass surgery, to preserve blood flow into the territory supplied by the permanently <b>trapped</b> <b>vessel.</b> The construction of the “ideal” bypass depends on several factors, the most important of which are amount of flow needed, recipient vessel, donor vessel, and microanastomosis technique. The choice between “complete” or “partial” trapping depends on angioanatomical criteria as well. A complete trapping is always favored, as it has the advantage of immediate aneurysm exclusion. When perforating vessels arise from the aneurysmal segment or when the inspection of all the angioanatomy of the aneurysm is considered inadvisable and risky, “partial trapping” strategies are of interest. Partial trapping may consist either of proximal or distal occlusion. We discuss the rationale behind these treatment modalities and illustrate it with a case series of seven patients successfully treated for complex intracranial aneurysmal lesions (location: 1 ICA, 1 ACom, 3 MCA, 2 PICA) ...|$|R
