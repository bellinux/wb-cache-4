5|$|Cyan playtested {{the game}} with two people {{sitting in front of}} the game, finding that they would {{converse}} with each other and vocalize their likes and dislikes compared to one person silently playing. Rand and Robyn sat behind the testers <b>taking</b> <b>notes,</b> and could make on-the-fly changes and fixes. Cyan wanted the interface of the game to be invisible, and to craft a game that all kinds of people would enjoy. Early on they had decided that there would be no inventory, enemies, or ways to die; eventually they included a save system as a concession to the fact that it would take most players months to complete the game. Among the problems testers discovered with the story was that Myst initially had no inciting incident. In response, Cyan added a note from Atrus to Catherine that clued players into the existence of a chamber by the dock that played a message from Atrus and explained the game's objectives.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} filmed over three {{days at the}} end of October and {{beginning}} of November 2002. It was supposed to take only two days, but the filming of the wedding scenes was postponed after Messing got sick on the first day. On November 3, 2002, the rooftop terrace scene was filmed at the New York Palace Hotel. In November 2002, the scene in Central Park was shot in New York. The wedding ceremony was filmed, in part, at Temple Israel of Hollywood. As the actors performed their lines in front of a studio audience, the writing staff stood behind the cameras <b>taking</b> <b>notes</b> in the script and watching the audience's reaction to jokes. The writers often stopped the cameras and added new inflections to the dialog. According to the Knoxville News Sentinels Terry Morrow, the cast handled the changes quickly, and scenes were routinely redone up to three times even if the actors executed their lines properly.|$|E

Announcing his intention to practise surgery only, Syme started a surgical hospital of his own, Minto House hospital, which he carried on from May 1829 to September 1833, with great success as a surgical charity and school of clinical instruction. It was here that he first put into practice his method of clinical teaching, which consisted in having the patients to be operated or prelected upon brought from the ward into a lecture-room or theatre where the students were seated conveniently for seeing and <b>taking</b> <b>notes.</b>|$|E

When the Nintendo DSi was announced, it was decided by Nintendo president Satoru Iwata that the company would work with Hatena, as the latter had recently shifted its R department to Kyoto, where Nintendo Corporate Labs is located.|$|E

Parents may apply for social assistance for a child that is studying on an elementary school or a high-school. If approved, the state provides basic study necessities for the child.

25|$|Google Keep is a note-taking service {{developed}} by Google. Launched on March 20, 2013, Google Keep {{is available on}} the web, and has mobile apps for the Android and iOS mobile operating systems. Keep offers a variety of tools for <b>taking</b> <b>notes,</b> including text, lists, images, and audio. Users can set reminders, which are integrated with Google Now. Text from images can be extracted using optical character recognition, and voice recordings can be transcribed. The interface allows for a single-column view or a multi-column view. Notes can be color-coded, and labels can be applied for organization. Later updates have added functionality to pin notes, and to collaborate on notes with other Keep users in real-time.|$|E
25|$|Both William and Anne {{appointed}} {{and dismissed}} Cabinet members, attended meetings, made decisions, and {{followed up on}} actions. Relieving the Sovereign of these responsibilities and gaining control over the Cabinet's composition was {{an essential part of}} evolution of the Premiership. This process began after the Hanoverian Succession. Although George I (1714–1727) attended Cabinet meetings at first, after 1717 he withdrew because he did not speak fluent English and was bored with the discussions. George II (1727–1760) occasionally presided at Cabinet meetings but his grandson, George III (1760–1820), is known to have attended only two during his 60-year reign. Thus, the convention that Sovereigns do not attend Cabinet meetings was established primarily through royal indifference to the everyday tasks of governance. The Prime Minister became responsible for calling meetings, presiding, <b>taking</b> <b>notes,</b> and reporting to the Sovereign. These simple executive tasks naturally gave the Prime Minister ascendancy over his Cabinet colleagues.|$|E

25|$|The Registry {{was split}} into several Departments; the Archives, the Accounting and Establishment, the Printing Service and the Copying Department. The Archives {{included}} a distribution {{service for the}} Court's documents and the legal texts used by the Court itself and was described {{as one of the}} most difficult departments to organise. The Accounting and Establishment Department dealt with the requests for and allocation of the Court's yearly budget, which was drawn up by the Registrar, approved by the Court and submitted to the League of Nations. The Printing Department, run from a single printing plant in Leiden, was created to allow the circulation of the Court's publishings. The Copying Department comprised shorthand, typing and copying services, and included secretaries for the Registrar and judges, emergency reporters capable of <b>taking</b> <b>notes</b> down verbatim and copyists; the smallest of the departments, it comprised between 12 and 40 staff depending on the business of the Court.|$|E

Kniess, an avid viewer of the show, recorded and watched every episode for four months prior to {{when he and his wife}} had tickets to attend in September 2008. Kniess learned that many prizes were repeatedly used (always at the same price) and began <b>taking</b> <b>notes.</b> Kniess was selected as a contestant on September 22, 2008, lost his pricing game (the only contestant to do so that episode), made it to the final showcase and guessed the exact amount of $23,743 for his showcase. Many show staffers, including Carey, were worried that the show was rigged and that Kniess was cheating. Kniess later explained that he had seen all three items of the showcase before and knew the general prices in the thousands. The 743 he used because it was his PIN, based on his wedding date and his wife's birth month.|$|E
25|$|Schaefer served four {{terms as}} mayor, being re-elected in 1975, 1979 and 1983, each time {{receiving}} 85% {{or more of}} the vote.

A famous photograph shows him dressed in an old-fashioned 19th century blue striped bathing suit, with a straw boat hat, carrying a rubber duck into the outside seal pool at the then-new National Aquarium in Baltimore at the Inner Harbor, attracting wide national media attention, to settle a wager {{that it would not be}} opened in time in August 1981. In 1984, in a move to give the majority African-American population more power in the city of Baltimore, Schaefer named Bishop L. Robinson as the Baltimore City Police Department's first African-American police commissioner, a position previously dominated by Irish American and Italian American members of the city police department.|$|E
