40|$|The {{facility}} <b>terminal</b> <b>cover</b> {{problem is}} a generalization of the vertex cover problem. The problem is to “cover ” the edges of an undirected graph G = (V, E) where each edge e {{is associated with a}} non-negative demand de. An edge e = [u, v] is covered if at least one of its endpoint vertices is allocated capacity of at least de. Each vertex v is associated with a non-negative weight wv. The goal is to allocate capacity cv ≥ 0 to each vertex v so that all edges are covered and the total allocation cost, � wvcv, is minimized. A recent paper by Xu, Yang and v∈V Xu (Networks, 50, (2007), 118 - 126), studied this problem, and presented a 2 e- approximation algorithm for this problem for e the base of the natural logarithm. We generalize here the facility <b>terminal</b> <b>cover</b> problem to the multi-integer set cover, and relate that problem to the set cover problem, which it generalizes, and the multi-cover problem. We present a ∆-approximation algorithm for the multi-integer set cover problem, for ∆ the maximum coverage. This demonstrates that even though the multi-integer set cover problem generalizes the set cover problem, the same approximation ratio holds. In the special case of the facility <b>terminal</b> <b>cover</b> problem this yields a 2 -approximation algorithm, and with run time dominated by the sorting of the edge demands. This approximation algorithm improves considerably on the result of Xu, Yang and Xu...|$|E
40|$|The cell {{bodies of}} motoneurons {{supplying}} both the levator costae and external intercostal muscles were identified after retrograde labelling with horseradish peroxidase. A quantitative ultrastructural comparison of cell bodies of large (greater than 40 microns) and small (less than 30 microns) diameter {{revealed that the}} intracellular appearance of large and small motoneurons was similar. However, small motoneurons had {{less than half the}} synaptic terminal frequency or cover of large motoneurons. Furthermore, only synapses of the S- and F-type were seen on small motoneurons, while S- T- F- and C-type terminals were consistently seen on large motoneurons. The variation between individual small motoneurons for various aspects of their synaptic features was more than twice that found for large motoneurons. No correlation between small motoneuronal ultrastructure and cell body diameter was found, although scatter diagrams of synaptic <b>terminal</b> <b>cover</b> against cell body size indicated the presence of two groups of small motoneurons: one with relatively high values for synaptic cover and the other with relatively low values. On the basis of the similarity of their cell body diameters to those of electrophysiologically identified alpha and gamma motoneurons, it is concluded that the large and small motoneurons examined in the present study are alpha and gamma motoneurons respectively. The synaptic difference found between alpha and gamma motoneurons is discussed in relation to both their different functional properties and the different natures of their respective peripheral targets...|$|E

Given a graph G and a subset T of {{vertices}} of G, a <b>terminal</b> path <b>cover</b> of G with respect to T is a set of pairwise vertex-disjoint paths PC that covers the vertices of G such that the vertices of T are all endpoints of the paths in PC.
