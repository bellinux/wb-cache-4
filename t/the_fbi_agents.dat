Keith confronts Veronica about her actions regarding the baby, angry that she used him and tells her he'll never be able to fully trust her again. <b>The</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>agents</b> search Veronica’s apartment, but Keith has removed the diapers and continues to claim he doesn't know anything.

5|$|At Sinclair's home, Jenny {{discovers that}} he is a Nazi secret agent and knocks him out. She is later {{detained}} and forced to leave a message for Cliff to bring the rocket pack to the Griffith Observatory in exchange for her life. Just before he is arrested by the FBI and taken to Hughes and Peevy, Cliff hides the rocket pack. Hughes explains that his rocket pack is a prototype, similar to one that Nazi scientists have, up to now, been unsuccessful in developing, and shows them a horrifying propaganda film that reveals the scope of the Nazis' plans, depicting an army of flying soldiers invading the United States. <b>The</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>agents</b> mention that they are tracking a Nazi spy in Hollywood, whom Cliff realizes to be Sinclair. When Hughes demands the return of the rocket pack, Cliff explains that he needs it to rescue Jenny; he escapes, inadvertently leaving behind a clue to where he is headed.|$|E

25|$|After the Dallas Police arrested Oswald and {{collected}} physical {{evidence at the}} crime scenes, they held Oswald at their headquarters for interrogation. All afternoon, they asked Oswald about the Tippit shooting and {{the assassination of the}} President. They intermittently questioned him for approximately 12hours between 2:30p.m., on November 22, and 11a.m., on November 24. Throughout this interrogation, Oswald denied any involvement with either Kennedy's assassination or Patrolman Tippit's murder. Captain Fritz of the homicide and robbery bureau did most of the questioning and kept only rudimentary notes. Days later, he wrote a report of the interrogation from notes he made afterwards. There were no stenographic or tape recordings. Representatives of other law enforcement agencies were also present, including the FBI and the Secret Service, and occasionally participated in the questioning. Several of <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>agents</b> who were present wrote contemporaneous reports of the interrogation.|$|E
25|$|At {{least three}} {{accounts}} exist {{of the following}} events: one given by the FBI, one by {{other people in the}} area, and one by local law enforcement. The accounts agree that, after obtaining some food at a local pool hall owned by his friend Charles Joy, Floyd hitched a ride in an East Liverpool neighborhood on October 22, 1934. He was spotted by the team of lawmen, at which point he broke from the vehicle and fled towards a treeline. Local retired officer Chester Smith fired first, hitting Floyd in the right arm, knocking him to the ground. At this point, the three accounts diverge; <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>agents</b> later attempted to claim all the credit, denying local law enforcement were even present at the shooting. According to the local police account, Floyd regained his footing and continued to run, at which point the entire team opened fire, knocking him to the ground. Floyd died from his wounds shortly thereafter.|$|E

Upon opening the door, he was confronted by FBI agents who addressed him as [...] "colonel" [...] and stated that they had [...] "information concerning [...] involvement in espionage." [...] Fisher knew that the FBI's use of his rank could have only come from Häyhänen.

The Bounty Hunter, who has returned to the school, continues his search for Praise. Meanwhile, Scully follows a girl, Thea (Christine Firkins), she had previously observed to be Praise's friend throughout the desert until she is able to locate Praise.

500|$|At {{his home}} Bruckman {{has gotten a}} note from the killer saying {{he is going to}} die when they first meet, and telling him to say [...] "hi" [...] to <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>agents.</b> The killer {{apparently}} also has some psychic ability - the postmark is dated before Bruckman joined the murder investigation. Bruckman describes Mulder's death as the killer sees it: getting his throat slit by the killer after stepping in a pie in a kitchen. However Bruckman tells Mulder he's not able to see what happens afterwards. Meanwhile, the inconspicuous man consults a tarot card reader (Alex Diakun), who says that the killer seeks answers from [...] "a man with special wisdom" [...] and that his confusion will soon abruptly end [...] "with the arrival of a woman - a blonde or a brunette, possibly a redhead."

Sarah, now {{convinced}} of the Dark Presence, helps Alan and Barry to find Cynthia Weaver, a hermit that fears the Dark Presence. She shows them to the [...] "Well-Lit Room" [...] and to a weapon that is able to defeat the Dark Presence: the Clicker, a simple light switch that has been infused {{with the power of}} Alan's writings. Alan returns to Cauldron Lake alone to face the Dark Presence, using his newfound ability to affect reality with his thoughts aided by the Clicker. The Dark Presence is dispelled but {{there is no sign of}} Alice, and Alan believes that to maintain balance, he must give himself to the lake. As Alan sinks below the waters, Alice climbs safely out of the lake. Within the depths of the lake, Alan finds himself in the cabin, and realises that Departure is not yet finished, and turns back to the typewriter to continue the story and write his own means to be free of the lake. He comments to himself that [...] "It's not a lake—it's an ocean." ...|$|E
500|$|The Griffins {{call the}} FBI to {{hopefully}} get Meg back, but the FBI {{say that a}} person must be missing for 96 hours before they could take action (even though, <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>agents</b> admit it's not likely they'll find her alive after she's been missing that long). Concerned by it, Brian and Stewie get to Paris themselves {{to take matters into}} their own hands and save Meg. They find out where the men took Meg, who is about to be sold as a sex slave. At the auction, Stewie dresses up as a slave and Brian dresses as an Arab to get in, and Stewie is sold to Brian (for $500,000). However, Brian cannot afford to pay for Stewie, and the guard uncovers their disguises. They are chained to a pipe downstairs, but Brian breaks free and overpowers the guard. They then follow Meg and her captors to a yacht traveling down the River Seine. On board, Meg is delivered to an Arab emir waiting in the master stateroom. After Meg refuses to be his sex slave, the emir reveals he bought her not to be a sex slave but to be his son's wife. The king introduces his teenage son, the young prince of the kingdom, who calls Meg a [...] "goddess" [...] and asks her to marry him or if she declines he will have her flown back to America on their private jet. Meg agrees to marry him, but Stewie then kills the prince, uses a neuralizer on Meg, and takes her to a French hospital for treatment before taking her home safely.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} consistently positive reviews. Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a positive review, writing [...] "One of the strengths of 'Monday' is in showing us Scully's evolution and how her experiences with Mulder allow her to embrace, albeit reluctantly, ideas that are not grounded in science." [...] Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the [...] "finest stand-alone episode" [...] of the sixth season and wrote, [...] "Time loops, if dragged on for too long, can become tedious, but in small doses they can be hilariously funny or achingly poignant. This episode is definitely the latter, as the downtrodden girlfriend of a bank robber is forced to witness the deaths of her boyfriend, Mulder, Scully and {{a large group of}} innocent people die over and over again until finally she breaks the loop by dying herself [...] The onus of saving everyone being largely on the shoulders of an unknown woman effectively brings in a change of pace and a welcome breath of fresh air." [...] Earl Cressey from DVD Talk called [...] "Monday" [...] one of the [...] "highlights of season six." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A" [...] and called it [...] "a script which balances humor, structural brilliance, and compassion in equal measure." [...] Handlen compared and contrasted the episode to Groundhog Day, noting that, while both feature a character who is able to restart a day, in [...] "Monday", the characters have the benefit of free will and can change factors: [...] "Every Monday to her has certain basic requirements: boyfriend with bomb, bank robbery, <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>agents</b> [...] and the earth-shattering Kaboom. Aside from that, nothing is certain." [...] Handlen concluded that the episode managed to be both [...] "a very funny hour", as well as possess serious [...] "sadness".|$|E
