5|$|The gun gallery was {{situated}} in the Recreation Yard and mounted on one of <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> hall's exterior walls. There was a metal detector outside of <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> hall for security purposes. <b>The</b> <b>dining</b> hall had tear-gas canisters attached to the rafters of the ceiling which could be activated by remote control, should prisoners riot or attempt to escape. The first warden, James A. Johnston, always entered <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> hall alone and unarmed, due to heavy guarding around him. Several riots did break out in <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> hall during Alcatraz's history.

5|$|A {{portrait}} of Marie closely resembling a photograph by Krøyer {{was completed in}} 1891. The following year, it {{was added to the}} frieze in <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room at Skagen's Brøndums Hotel which had become the artists' favourite meeting place. Placed next to Krøyer's own portrait, it confirmed Marie's position as an accepted member of the Skagen Painters. <b>The</b> <b>dining</b> room was designed by the architects Ulrik Plesner and Thorvald Bindesbøll in connection with the first major expansion of the hotel in 1892. At Krøyer's suggestion, it was decided to incorporate Degn Brøndum's art collection into its decoration. Over the years it became a custom that visiting artists donated portraits of each other to the hotel owner and these were placed in a frieze just under the ceiling. Today <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room together with its frieze forms part of Skagens Museum.|$|E

5|$|In February 1907, {{with nearly}} 300 new stockholders, Harvey began {{construction}} {{on his next}} hotel, Oklahoma Row, also designed by A. O. Clarke. It was built {{to the west of}} Missouri Row with a wide lawn. It had a similar log, concrete stone, and tile construction. <b>The</b> <b>dining</b> room was on the north end. Each of the 40 rooms had fireplaces, as did <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room and center hall. Every room featured electric lights, sewerage, and running spring water. The hotel also boasted a three-story concrete tower, one of the earliest multistory concrete constructions in the country. Oklahoma Row and other construction projects drained Harvey's funds. Harvey managed to raise enough money to finish Oklahoma Row, but due to his lack of funds, when that hotel finally opened there was no gala event, as there had been when Missouri Row was finished.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} intricate intersections of code switching, trickster discourse and rhetorical sovereignty in <b>the</b> scholarship of <b>Diné</b> author Laura Tohe, as Tohe operationalizes survivance and alliance in complex ways, ways that “actuate a presence” {{in the face}} of ongoing attempts to render American Indian peoples absent from American rhetorical, literary, and geographic landscapes. Existing research in American Indian literatures and rhetorics often focus on the need for reclaiming rhetorical sovereignty. Yet, little work has been done to emphasize connections between the use of code switching, translation, and trickster discourse in order to give visibility to past and contemporary Diné peoples and to decolonize <b>the</b> <b>Diné</b> history. This dissertation uses decolonizing methodologies to demonstrate that Tohe’s writing is an action to regain the sovereignty and visibility that has been torn from the tongues and bodies of American Indian peoples, specifically <b>the</b> <b>Diné,</b> after years of colonization, oppression, and resistance. Chapter one provides the necessary historical context of <b>the</b> <b>Diné</b> and <b>the</b> Navajo Long Walk, and chapter two presents an explanation for the various theoretical and critical frameworks for this dissertation. Chapter three provides an explanation about the lens through which the visibility and voice of <b>the</b> <b>Diné</b> is exacted through Tohe’s use of rhetorics of survivance and alliance, as well as her attempt to decolonize <b>the</b> <b>Diné</b> history. Chapter four further explores Tohe’s decolonization of <b>the</b> <b>Diné</b> history and <b>the</b> reclamation of her rhetorical sovereignty through her use of trickster and trickster discourse, as she attempts to decolonize representations of <b>the</b> <b>Diné</b> and provide her own representation {{of what it means to}} be <b>Diné.</b> <b>The</b> dissertation ends with a reevaluation of the discussions surrounding the use of American Indian texts in an introductory American literature course. Chapter five guides educators in how using a text, such as Tohe’s, is beneficial to not only the promotion of American Indian texts in the classroom, but the necessity of disrupting, adding to, and maintaining our students’ acknowledgment, awareness, and understanding of the significance of rhetorical sovereignty and the power of those voices of American Indian authors in claiming that sovereignty and resisting colonial attempts to silence them...|$|R

5|$|After being {{purchased}} by the Guellers in 2004, the restaurant was redecorated and modernised, the décor having become shabby under previous owners. The new decorations included recessed lighting and fabric-covered walls. There is a fireplace in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room, with an 18th-century settle (a type of bench) beside it. Elements from the Reid and Long era remain, with the bar and ceilings still being recognisable from their time at the restaurant.|$|E
5|$|As the Britannia Restaurant {{takes up}} the full width of the ship on two decks, a 'tween deck, called Deck 3L, was devised to allow {{passengers}} to walk from the Grand Lobby to the Queen's Room without traversing <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room mid-meal. The deck consists of two corridors that run beneath the upper balcony of the restaurant on Deck 3, and above the main dining area on Deck 2. This is why the balcony of the Britannia has tiers that step up towards the hull. This arrangement is illustrated on the hull {{where there is a}} stack of three rows of windows in the area where the main restaurant sits, the two upper and lower most rows illuminate <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room, while the centre row serves Deck 3L. There is a similar arrangement through the Royal Court Theatre. As well, the passages that run on either side of Illuminations on Deck 3 ramp upwards to compensate for the change in deck elevation between the entrance to Illuminations and an elevator bank forward of the room.|$|E

50|$|Navajo spiritual {{practice}} is about restoring balance and harmony to a person's life to produce health {{and is based}} on the ideas of Hózhóójí. <b>The</b> <b>Diné</b> believed in two classes of people: Earth People and Holy People. The Navajo people believe they passed through three worlds before arriving in this world, the Fourth World or the Glittering World. As Earth People, <b>the</b> <b>Diné</b> must do everything within their power to maintain the balance between Mother Earth and man. <b>The</b> <b>Diné</b> also had <b>the</b> expectation of keeping a positive relationship between them and <b>the</b> Diyin <b>Diné.</b> In <b>the</b> <b>Diné</b> Bahane' (Navajo beliefs about creation), the First, or Dark World is where <b>the</b> four Diyin <b>Diné</b> lived and where First Woman and First Man came into existence. Because the world was so dark, life could not thrive there and they had to move on. The Second, or Blue World, was inhabited by a few of the mammals Earth People know today as well as the Swallow Chief, or Táshchózhii. The First World beings had offended him and were asked to leave. From there, they headed south and arrived in the Third World, or Yellow World. The four sacred mountains were found here, but due to a great flood, First Woman, First Man, and the Holy People were forced to find another world to live in. This time, when they arrived, they stayed in the Fourth World. In the Glittering World, true death came into existence, as well as the creations of the seasons, the moon, stars, and the sun.|$|R
