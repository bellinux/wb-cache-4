40|$|In {{order to}} improve its {{shipping}} operations a major salt exporter needs to reduce costs, increase market share and improve customer service. This thesis examines the use of linear (LP) and nonlinear programming (NLP) {{as a means of}} solving a nonlinear transhipment problem associated with the export of salt. Tho feasibility of using a LP or NLP approach is explored, taking into consideration the computational time and useability of the models. To meet the demands of their customers the company currently uses heuristic methods to allocate varying size ships to different routes. To remain competitive the shipping options that are considered include the optimisation of vessel chartering for effective scheduling to customers, selection of vessel type, stockpiling <b>and</b> <b>transhipment.</b> This thesis examines the vessel Selection <b>and</b> <b>transhipment</b> options <b>and</b> provides for improvements. The NLP approach developed in this thesis is implemented under the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). It is expected the results will provide improvements to shipping methods and reduction of costs in salt exportation and will have applications to shipping problems in other industries...|$|R

Terrorists {{have been known to}} utilise websites and emails to place manuals, instructions, blueprints and other documents, known as Intangible Technology Transfer (ITT), to incite and encourage their peers to create biological weapons; subsequently, to launch an attack of bioterrorism. Simultaneously, terrorists may camouflage their identity and attend oral and visual exchanges such as teleconferences, virtual meetings and skills training sessions that disseminate relevant information on biological weapons. This makes it possible for terrorists who already possess some background knowledge of biological weapons to further their interests in creating these weapons. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyse Malaysia's STA 2010 concerning relevant provisions that are able to address the threat of ITT over the internet and telecommunications by terrorists in the context of disseminating knowledge of biological weapons to perpetuate bioterrorism. The results show that the provisions of Sections 2, 4, 9 and 10 of STA 2010 are relevant in addressing the ITT of individuals using the internet to encourage creating biological weapons abroad by involving extraterritorial jurisdiction, extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters. This study concludes that Malaysia's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), implementers of the STA 2010, must deliberate on these unclear matters and draft detailed guidelines to direct Malaysian researchers and academics, learning from the examples of other countries...|$|R

In contrast to discrete lot-sizing models, {{the timing of}} stock receipts is variable and not confined to period boundaries. However, Bilgen and Günther (2010) have shown that stock receipts can be modelled by introducing an auxiliary time grid and by use of additional binary variables which indicate whether a production activity is completed up to a particular point in time. In this way, inventory states <b>and</b> <b>transhipment</b> quantities {{can be incorporated into}} the model formulation.|$|R

A centralized supply chain model is then discussed. The game model is further extended to uncertain demand situations.

40|$|Many {{small island}} states have {{developed}} economies that are strongly dependent on tuna fisheries. Consequently, they {{are vulnerable to}} the socio-economic {{effects of climate change}} and variability, processes that are known to impact tuna fisheries distribution and productivity. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the impacts of climate oscillations on the tuna-dependent economy of Seychelles. Using a multiplier approach, the direct, indirect and induced economic effects of the tuna industry expenditure benefiting the Seychelles' economy declined in 1998 by 58, 26 and 35 %, respectively (mean decline: 42 %), a year of strong climate oscillation in the western Indian Ocean. Multivariate patterns in tuna purse-seine vessel expenditures in port were substantially modified by strong climate oscillations, particularly in 1998. A cointegration time-series model predicted that a 40 % decline in tuna landings <b>and</b> <b>transhipment</b> in Port Victoria, a value commensurate with that observed in 1998, would result in a 34 % loss for the local economy solely through reductions in cargo handling expenditures. Of several indices tested, the Indian Oscillation Index was best at predicting the probability of switching between low and high regimes of landings <b>and</b> <b>transhipment,</b> which translate into impacts for the economy. It is hypothesised that a late 2006 /early 2007 climate oscillation was compounded by prior overfishing to produce a stronger impact on the fishery and economy of Seychelles. The effects of fishing and climate variability on tuna fisheries are complex and pose significant challenges for fisheries management and the economic development of countries in the Indian Ocean...|$|R

Dual formulations are indicated for constraints on the flow to destinations from origins. In the case of a set of capacity constraints on the flow from each origin to each destination, the models proposed are easily seen to be of minimal dimension for any "standardized" version of such a capacitated problem. ...|$|R
