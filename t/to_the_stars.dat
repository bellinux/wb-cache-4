5|$|<b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stars</b> is {{an album}} by American jazz fusion group the Chick Corea Elektric Band, {{released}} on August 24, 2004 by Stretch Records. Jazz musician Chick Corea, a longtime {{member of the}} Church of Scientology, was inspired by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's science fiction 1954 novel <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stars.</b> Hubbard's book {{tells the story of}} an interstellar crew which experiences the effects of time dilation due to traveling at near light speed. A few days experienced by the ship's crew could amount to hundreds of years for their friends and family back on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Ecliptic {{coordinates}} are {{convenient for}} specifying positions of Solar System objects, {{as most of}} the planets' orbits have small inclinations to the ecliptic, and therefore always appear relatively close to it on the sky. Because Earth's orbit, and hence the ecliptic, moves very little, it is a relatively fixed reference with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Holloway made short propaganda films on behalf of the British Film Institute and Pathé News and took character parts in a series of war films including Major Barbara, The Way Ahead, This Happy Breed and The Way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stars.</b> After the war, he appeared in the film Brief Encounter and made a series of films for Ealing Studios, including Passport to Pimlico, The Lavender Hill Mob and The Titfield Thunderbolt.|$|E
5|$|Free-floating {{planets in}} stellar {{clusters}} have similar velocities <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> {{and so can}} be recaptured. They are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and 105 AU. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster volume, and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary mass. It is almost independent of the planetary mass. Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits, non-coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin, or pre-existing planetary system.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{acceptance}} of the discovery paper, the Kepler team referred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> as Kepler-452, which is the normal procedure for naming the exoplanets discovered by the spacecraft. Hence, this is the name usually used by <b>the</b> public <b>to</b> refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> and its planet.|$|R
5000|$|... 30 Arietis Bb (sometimes {{abbreviated}} 30 Ari Bb) is an {{extrasolar planet}} which orbits the F-type main sequence star 30 Arietis B, {{located in a}} quadruple star system approximately 129 light years away in the constellation Aries. This planet has minimum mass nearly 10 times that of Jupiter. Because inclination is not known, its true mass is unknown. Meanwhile, this planet orbits only 0.005 AU (or 700,000 km) closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> than Earth <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sun, but its orbital eccentricity is much higher compared to Earth. At periastron, the planet’s closest distance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> is 0.708 AU, which is slightly closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> than Venus <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sun. At apastron, the planet’s farthest distance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> is 1.283 AU, {{which is more than}} halfway between the orbits of Earth and Mars.|$|R

5|$|In 1997 Hollywood {{producers}} {{were working}} on developing a film version of <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stars.</b> Producers Barbara Boyle and Michael Taylor were preparing to bring the book to the film screen for Touchstone Pictures, a division of Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group. Boyle and Taylor had previously worked with actor John Travolta on the film Phenomenon, and the project was planned {{to be part of}} Travolta's vision to make films out of L. Ron Hubbard's science fiction novels. Hubbard's novel Battlefield Earth was first on his list, and Travolta starred in and helped fund the film version of the book which was released in 2000. A film version of <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stars</b> had not yet begun production as of 2008.|$|E

Grace reprised {{the role of}} Shannon in two more episodes of Lost, {{including}} the series finale. In 2013, she appears in the sixth season of Californication. She portrays Faith, a groupie and a muse <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars,</b> who captures the eye of Hank Moody played by David Duchovny.|$|E
25|$|During these {{experiments}} he also discovered a similar effect; the apparent positions of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> did {{change over the}} year, but not as expected. Instead of the apparent angle being maximized when the Earth was {{at either end of}} its orbit with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>star,</b> <b>the</b> angle was maximized when the Earth was at its fastest sideways velocity with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> This interesting effect is now known as stellar aberration.|$|R

5|$|<b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stars</b> {{was first}} {{published}} in two parts in February and March 1950 in a serialized format by John W. Campbell in Astounding Science Fiction. Hubbard had previously written the story Ole Doc Methuselah for Astounding Science Fiction in 1947, later published as a book in 1992. In 1954 the story was published in book format by Ace Books in a paperback first edition, under the title Return to Tomorrow. Garland Publishing released a hardcover edition of Return to Tomorrow in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Chosen to play Quatermass was the {{distinguished}} actor John Mills, who {{had appeared in}} significant roles in many high-profile British films, including The Way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stars</b> (1945), Great Expectations (1946) and Ice Cold in Alex (1958), and had won an Academy Award {{for his role in}} Ryan's Daughter (1970). Mills, whose only previous television credit at the time was The Zoo Gang (1974), was reluctant to take the part but was convinced by his wife, who liked the script. Following Quatermass he appeared in Gandhi (1982), Martin Chuzzlewit (1994) and Hamlet (1997), working right up to his death in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Corea {{explains}} at {{his website}} {{how he was}} motivated to work on music inspired by <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stars,</b> commenting that he {{was inspired by a}} scene from the book in which Hubbard describes the Captain of the spaceship in the story playing a melody on a piano. He had read the book eight or nine times, and after writing down musical composition based on Hubbard's work the album was created as a tone poem piece. Previous tone poem albums by Corea include The Leprechaun (1975), My Spanish Heart (1976), and The Mad Hatter (1978). The piece is Corea's first attempt at musical interpretation from one of Hubbard's works.|$|E

5|$|The {{conquest of}} Asia by Alexander the Great exposed the Greeks to ideas from Syria, Babylon, Persia and central Asia. Around 280 BCE, Berossus, a priest of Bel from Babylon, {{moved to the}} Greek island of Kos, {{teaching}} astrology and Babylonian culture. By the 1st century BCE, there were two varieties of astrology, one using horoscopes to describe the past, present and future; the other, theurgic, emphasising the soul's ascent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars.</b> Greek influence {{played a crucial role}} in the transmission of astrological theory to Rome.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stars</b> is {{a science}} fiction novel by L. Ron Hubbard.

5|$|Moore {{received}} considerable {{recognition in}} the late 1990s and early 2000s, earning Oscar nominations for Boogie Nights (1997), The End of the Affair (1999), Far from Heaven (2002) and The Hours (2002). In {{the first of these}} she played a 1970s pornographic actress, while the other three featured her as an unhappy, mid-20th century housewife. She also had success with the films The Big Lebowski (1998), Magnolia (1999), Hannibal (2001), Children of Men (2006), A Single Man (2009), The Kids Are All Right (2010), and Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011), and won several awards for her portrayal of Sarah Palin in the television film Game Change (2012). The year 2014 was key for Moore, as she gave an Oscar-winning performance as an Alzheimer's patient in Still Alice, was named Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival for Maps <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stars,</b> and joined the lucrative Hunger Games series.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations with malicious intent could send {{information that could}} enable human civilization to destroy itself, such as powerful computer viruses or {{information on how to}} make extremely potent weapons that humans would not yet be able to use responsibly. While the motives for such an action are unknown, it would require minimal energy use {{on the part of the}} extraterrestrials. According to Musso, however, computer viruses in particular will be nearly impossible unless extraterrestrials possess detailed knowledge of human computer architectures, which would only happen if a human message sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> were protected with little thought to security. Even a virtual machine on which extraterrestrials could run computer programs could be designed specifically for the purpose, bearing little relation to computer systems commonly used on Earth. In addition, humans could send messages to extraterrestrials detailing that they do not want access to the Encyclopædia Galactica until they have reached a suitable level of technological advancement, thus mitigating harmful impacts of extraterrestrial technology.|$|E
5|$|Rodimus, {{being given}} {{half of the}} Matrix, decides to lead {{a search for the}} fabled Knights of Cybertron in the hope that they can help restore order to Cybertron. Taking <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> on board the ship called the Lost Light, Rodimus is joined by Ultra Magnus and Drift as his second-and-third-in-commands, Ratchet, Chromedome, Rewind, Swerve, Brainstorm, Rung, Whirl and a {{reformed}} Cyclonus, among several others. Following an unexpected quantum jump upon launch, the Lost Light is hurled off into the depths of space, where the crew is joined by Skids and contends with a stowaway Sparkeater. A visit to Delphi by Ratchet to help cure a plague introduces the threat of the Decepticon Justice Division, who then feature in a Decepticon-dedicated story menacing a band of misfit Decepticons, and also brings the facility's surviving patients and staff onto the ship—including Fortress Maximus, whose post-traumatic stress causes him to snap and nearly kill Rung. Hoping to cure Rung's damaged brain, Rewind gathers a small group together to recount a shared story from their past about Orion Pax foiling a Senate plot to discredit the burgeoning Decepticon movement in the days of Functionism. Chromedome is manipulated by Drift into carrying out a plan laid out by Prowl: using his mnemosurgery skills to tap the memories and learn the secrets of mass-murdering Decepticon Overlord, secretly hidden on board the Lost Light. Unfortunately, Chromedome accidentally allows Overlord to escape, and Rewind has to sacrifice himself to jettison the monster from the ship before the section of the ship is blown up. Drift admits to responsibility for Overlord's actions, resulting in his exile, even though Rodimus later reveals he {{was a part of the}} plot as well. Ultra Magnus is also fatally wounded in the battle, but when his body disappears from the ship's Medibay, the crew track it to Luna 1, where they discover and foil a twisted plot by Chief Justice Tyrest to wipe out all those Transformers he sees as tainted by original sin.|$|E
