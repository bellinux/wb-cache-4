25|$|The Community's initial aim was {{to bring}} about {{economic}} integration, including a common market and customs union, among its six founding members: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. It gained {{a common set of}} institutions along with the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) as one of the European Communities under the 1965 Merger Treaty (Treaty of Brussels). In 1993, a complete single market was achieved, known as the internal market, which allowed for the free movement of goods, capital, services, and people within the EEC. In 1994, the internal market was formalised by <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> <b>agreement.</b> This agreement also extended the internal market to include most of the member states of the European Free Trade Association, forming the European Economic Area covering 15 countries.|$|E

In this article it is argued that {{a great deal of the}} credit for this accomplishment is due to the EFTA Court. Through a distinctly dynamic approach to the Agreement, the EFTA Court has been able to convince an initially sceptical ECJ that the goal of extending the internal market to include the EFTA States is actually achievable. For the EFTA States, the consequence is a more ‘supranational’ <b>EEA</b> <b>Agreement</b> than originally conceived. Further, it is shown that the EFTA Court appears, in hard cases, to lean even further towards teleological (ie integrationist) interpretation than the ECJ. It is suggested that this may be due to to structural imbalances between <b>the</b> two <b>EEA</b> courts, <b>the</b> EFTA Court’s desire to prove its independence from the EFTA States and its quest for recognition from the ECJ...|$|R

50|$|Were the UK to {{join the}} EEA as an EFTA member, it would sign up to {{existing}} EU internal market legislation {{that is part of}} <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> <b>Agreement.</b> Changes to the internal market would be incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> <b>Agreement</b> subject to the consent of the UK at the EEA Joint Committee; once in <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> <b>Agreement,</b> the UK would have to incorporate these into UK Law.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{in recent years that}} EU policies towards Northern Europe could serve as a potential model for the EU’s relations with its other neighbours. This paper focuses on two particular EU policies towards non-EU members in Northern Europe: the Northern Dimension (ND) initiative and the European Economic Area (EEA), which are analysed in light of two broader themes: first, how the EU organises its policy towards its neighbours more generally and, secondly, the enlargement process and how the EU has attempted to develop alternatives to EU membership. The Northern Dimension could be a useful model for the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), in particular vis-à-vis the Eastern neighbours, although it must be recognised that the regional approach has played a limited role in confronting strategic challenges and resolving politically contentious issues in EU neighbourhood policies. The initial proposals from the EU for its European Neighbourhood Policy fall far short of the sort of relations currently existing between the EU and the three EFTA (European Free Trade Association) states in <b>the</b> <b>EEA.</b> <b>The</b> <b>agreements</b> with the erstwhile EU accession candidates of Central and Eastern Europe and the countries of south-east Europe could appear to provide more suitable models for the ENP than <b>the</b> <b>EEA.</b> However, <b>the</b> prospect of eventual EU membership is a fundamental premise underlying these agreements, which makes certain provisions and institutional arrangements acceptable to the associated states that might otherwise be found objectionable. This conundrum is likely to dominate the debate on EU neighbourhood policies for years to come...|$|R

40|$|The {{publicity}} surrounding[ [...] . ] {{incidents of}} industrial espionage {{resulted in a}} push for federal protections. In response to this pressure from U. S. industries, Congress passed the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (2 ̆ 2 EEA 2 ̆ 2). <b>The</b> <b>EEA</b> protects trade secrets {{through the use of}} federal criminal sanctions. 2 ̆ 2 <b>The</b> <b>EEA</b> 2 ̆ 7 s provisions are introduced in Part I. Trade secrets are a form of intellectual property. Therefore, a basic understanding of intellectual property law is important to an analysis of <b>the</b> <b>EEA.</b> Part II of this Article provides an overview of the various forms of intellectual property. To be effective, <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> must complement existing intellectual property jurisprudence. Yet, on its face <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> prohibits practices that are otherwise lawful as part of a reverse engineering program. Part II of this Article also describes reverse engineering and examines its acceptance in each area of intellectual property law. Understanding <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> in terms of the other forms of intellectual property protection and the practice of reverse engineering raises some concerns over the prudence of vigorous EEA enforcement. A strict reading of <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> may prohibit reverse engineering. Since reverse engineering plays {{a significant role in the}} exploitation of knowledge committed to the public domain through the grant of patents and copyrights, prohibiting reverse engineering may stifle the drive to study and improve upon the existing knowledge base. Part III of this Article examines these concerns. The increasing importance of intellectual property in the world economy has created a trend toward criminalization of infringement. In addition to the acts covered by <b>the</b> <b>EEA,</b> some international <b>agreements</b> require criminal sanctions for infringement of various rights, certain acts of copyright infringement carry criminal penalties, and Congress is currently considering the Collections of Information Antipiracy Act. While these laws are designed to protect intellectual property, the inclusion of criminal sanctions means that they must be analyzed in light of criminal law theories such as notice, vagueness, and leniency. As this trend continues, and prosecutions under these new laws become more frequent, it will be important for criminal practitioners to have a firm grasp of intellectual property concepts and for intellectual property attorneys to understand the importance of criminal law. Finally, it is important for Congress to consider such criminal law issues when enacting new intellectual property legislation. A discussion of these issues with respect to <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> provides a framework for developing this discussion with respect to other intellectual property laws. To assist in determining the legitimacy of these concerns, Part I also examines the legislative history of <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> to ascertain congressional intent with respect to the identified problems. Based upon the issues raised in Part III, Part IV proposes a solution to address these concerns while maintaining the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> in fulfilling its intended purpose. Specifically, the Article proposes amending <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> to explicitly allow reverse engineering and to limit its application to espionage activities similar to those Congress had in mind when drafting the Act...|$|R

Regressions include economic and political factors.

The political factors are those used in the recent literature. The results are extremely precise and consistent. Most of the variables have the predicted sign and are significant at the 1 % level. More than 80 % of the communities' vote variance is explained by the model, substantially reducing the residuals when compared to former studies. The policital variables do have the expected sign and are significant as well.
