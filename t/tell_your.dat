500|$|In a brief {{review for}} Entertainment Weekly, Sean Richardson wrote that Taking Back Sunday was [...] "best suited for {{multipart}} campfire sing-alongs" [...] and struck [...] "rock-radio gold" [...] with Where You Want to Be. Sam Sutherland of Exclaim! {{wrote that the}} group created [...] "an exact musical duplicate" [...] of <b>Tell</b> <b>Your</b> Friends. Although, [...] "unadventurous as it is, the melodies remain catchy and the riffs remain driving." [...] Rolling Stone reviewer Laura Sinagra noted Mascherino and Rubano as assisting [...] "the will to power in Lazzara's Cure-like croon." [...] Sinagra called [...] "A Decade Under the Influence" [...] the nearest that the singer gets to the [...] "emotional tensions and ragged-rock edge" [...] of <b>Tell</b> <b>Your</b> Friends. Spin writer Andy Greenwald wrote that nearly every song on the album [...] "begins in the moment just before a fight or a tear-filled breakdown." [...] Citing [...] "New American Classic" [...] and [...] "This Photograph Is Proof (I Know You Know)," [...] Greenwald noted Adam Lazzara's use of [...] "anthemic choruses like 15-year-olds use emoticons: as sweeping shorthand placeholders for feelings too complicated to puzzle out and express." ...|$|E

[...] "It Just Won't Quit", Steinman explains, [...] "is {{about the fact that}} there are some things you never shake off... That's love, I guess."

500|$|In the 1996–97 season, Wetherall played less {{regularly}} as {{new manager}} George Graham experimented with defensive combinations, though {{by the following}} season he had re-established himself in the starting eleven, sometimes acting as captain, and signed a new five-year contract. On 27 September 1997, he scored in the 1–0 victory over arch-rivals Manchester United when Roy Keane's knee was badly injured {{in the act of}} fouling Alf-Inge Håland, who then accused Keane of feigning injury. Keane later took revenge on Håland during a Manchester derby and said to Håland as he lay on the ground: [...] "And don't ever stand over me again sneering about fake injuries, and <b>tell</b> <b>your</b> pal Wetherall there's some for him as well." [...] Later that season Wetherall was among the Leeds travelling party who escaped unhurt as their aircraft crash-landed after an engine caught fire on takeoff.|$|E

In the episode, Jim refers to a TripAdvisor page for Dwight's bed and breakfast. This can be found by searching for Schrute Farms. Jim and Pam ("JandP2") post a review, which can be seen on the actual reviews page. It reads: [...] "The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm, and the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of simpler times. You will never want to leave your room. The informative lecture will satisfy all your beet curiosity, and the dawn goose walk will tug at your heart strings. Table making never seemed so possible.

500|$|Aside from this, however, Madonna {{also wanted}} to explore the British club musical scene, where genres such as dub had been growing in popularity. In such a way, she decided to work with several European {{producers}} and composers within the electronic scene, including Nellee Hooper, who pleased Madonna due to his [...] "very European sensibility". Inviting Hooper over to Los Angeles, sessions started {{taking place in the}} Chappell Studios of Encino, California. Björk accepted the offer to write a track for Madonna's album, and wrote a song initially named [...] "Let's Get Unconscious". Once the song demo had been finished, Hooper and Marius De Vries rearranged the track and the final version was called [...] "Bedtime Story", which became the album's third single. Academic Georges Claude Guilbert, author of Madonna As Postmodern Myth, felt that the album's title was a pun; [...] " [...] is referring to (possible erotic) stories told at bedtime (in bed). In a way (the album) is really a book of stories you can <b>tell</b> <b>your</b> kids at bedtime [...] sexuality explained to children [...] Madonna has always thought that children should be better informed in that aspect".|$|E
500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{gave the}} episode 9.5/10, writing [...] "This wasn't {{just a good}} episode – it was great. It {{capitalized}} on absolutely every scrap of promise the show has had in its first nine episodes. <b>Tell</b> <b>your</b> friends and neighbors, they're probably {{going to want to}} tune in when this returns after the break. Not only that, but this episode heightens and improves every episode that has come before – as now all the pieces are important". Total Sci-Fi Online rated the episode 7/10, and expressed the wish that [...] "Safe" [...] could have been used as the series' pilot. [...] "The central premise has more pull, it draws together various plot strands going back to the pilot, meaningfully involves several seemingly incidental characters and events from the past, and zips along at a better pace. It’s a shame it took this long to reach this part of the puzzle, where a few of the pieces at last click satisfyingly into place". Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend thought the episode [...] "was actually well thought out, well written, and not confusing at all. Plus, the characters seemed to be complete. Now, all the brains behind this could-be great show have to do is keep it up".|$|E

However, Lee, unrepentant, stated [...] "I am not apologizing." [...] He told Italians there was [...] "a lot about your history you have yet {{to come to grips}} with. This film is our interpretation, and I stand behind it." [...] McBride, the novel's author, stated: [...] "As a black American, I understand what it's like for someone to <b>tell</b> <b>your</b> history... unfortunately, the history of World War Two here in Italy is ours as well, and this was the best I could do... it is, after all, a work of fiction.” ...|$|E

500|$|... "New Rules" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a tropical house, EDM, and electropop song with elements of bashment, featuring a drum and horn instrumentation. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Faber Music, the song is composed in the key of A minor, and has a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Lipa's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. In the lyrics, the singer sets a list of rules that prevent her from getting back together with an ex-boyfriend. The rules are: [...] "One: Don't pick up the phone, you know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone / Two: Don't let him in, you'll have to kick him out again / Three: Don't be his friend, you know you're going to wake up in his bed in the morning." [...] Lipa confessed in an interview with NPR that [...] "hey're not necessarily rules I've been able to stick by. But [...] rules that I feel like it's important to be able to tell yourself, to <b>tell</b> <b>your</b> friends... There's a reason people break up, and it's probably the same reason why you shouldn't get back together." [...] Warren explained through an annotation on website Genius that the track was a self-reminder for people recovering from a break-up to not succumb to a momentary temptation since it is not [...] "a good idea in the long term".|$|E
500|$|... "Picture to Burn" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim. [...] Chris Neal of Country Weekly believed [...] "Picture to Burn", {{along with}} [...] "Should've Said No", {{were the most}} immediately striking songs on Taylor Swift. Jack Lowe of About.com said the song was fun, and that females would specially enjoy it. Kate Kiefer of Paste magazine selected the track as one of Swift's six best singles, and stated, [...] "She really shows her age in this one". Roger Holland of PopMatters commented that the song was the epitome of how, according to him, Swift was more given in uptempo tempos, and that it served as indication {{to the nature of}} Swift's debut album. Holland added, [...] "'Picture to Burn' is two parts Ashlee Simpson to one part Amy Dalley, with an overly familiar guitar melody that could have been lifted directly from the latter." [...] Top music critic Robert Christgau selected [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] as a highlight on Taylor Swift. Josh Love of The Village Voice attributed the song {{to be one of the}} reasons how the singer rose to stardom. He called it a [...] "bluntly relatable composition [...] that connected [...] with teens from across the spectrum." [...] Patrick McDonald of The Seattle Times called it a [...] "clever, sassy, upbeat song" [...] Alison Bonaguro of the Chicago Tribune said the song was a [...] "clean-but-still-rowdy" [...] number for Swift. Kevin Courtney of The Irish Times mentioned [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] among powerful revenge songs and noted the lyric [...] "Go and <b>tell</b> <b>your</b> friends that I'm obsessive and crazy / That's fine / I'll tell mine you're gay." [...] He supported the sentiment behind the song and wrote, [...] "You go girl".|$|E
500|$|EastEnders has {{received}} {{praise for the}} handling of Peggy's breast cancer storyline, as she was a rare media portrayal of an older matriarchal woman with the disease. Older women are at higher risk of being diagnosed; however, in 2001, {{it was reported that}} media representation of breast cancer is skewed towards younger women in their 20s or 30s, as they are seen as [...] "more tragic" [...] or [...] "more sexy" [...] in media terms. A 2000 study by Kitzinger and Henderson showed that 94% of newspaper coverage on non-celebrity women with breast cancer was on those aged under 50. Source organisations working with EastEnders on the storyline have commented: [...] " [...] decided {{it was going to be}} [...] and very rightly so. Bang on, the right age [...] perfect dramatic licence in terms of her sons that she was going to have to share this terrible news with, and how would she share it? Every female would have that problem. How would you <b>tell</b> <b>your</b> children? And they followed that with her. She was exactly the right person." [...] The storyline also received media criticism, for the use of a breast care nurse, who was used to counsel Peggy and translate medical terminology into lay terms for viewers; a character who could provide both a dramatic and educational purpose. However, not all oncology units in the UK offer breast care nurses, and the character presented [...] "particularly positive messages" [...] concerning patient choice and control over treatment options. Because of this, the UK press dubbed the storyline [...] "didactic". The storyline was also criticised because Peggy received her cancer test results after six days, which prompted cancer charities to warn that not all patients would receive the same treatment.|$|E
