In 1988, McAuliffe married Swann's daughter, Dorothy. McAuliffe invested $800,000 in Swann's American Pioneer Savings Bank, which was taken over In 1990 by federal regulators, causing Swann to file for bankruptcy. <b>The</b> <b>Resolution</b> <b>Trust</b> Corporation, a federal agency, took over American Pioneer's assets and liabilities. Under Swann's guidance, McAuliffe purchased some of American Pioneer's real estate from <b>the</b> <b>Resolution</b> <b>Trust</b> Corporation. McAuliffe's equal partner in the deal was a pension fund controlled by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA). They purchased real estate valued at $50 million for $38.7 million; McAuliffe received a 50% equity stake. The deal was arranged by Jack Moore, a NECA trustee and acquaintance of McAuliffe. Next, McAuliffe acquired a distressed house-building company, American Heritage Homes, which had been buying real estate formerly owned by American Pioneer. McAuliffe served as chairman of American Heritage along with CEO Carl H. Linder. The Florida-based company came out of distress under a plan in which it built 800 homes a year.|$|E

5000|$|Early on, Apollo made a {{name for}} itself by {{acquiring}} interests in companies that Drexel had helped finance by purchasing high-yield bonds from failed savings and loans and insurance companies. Apollo acquired several large portfolios of assets from <b>the</b> U.S. government's <b>Resolution</b> <b>Trust</b> Corporation. [...] One of Apollo's earliest and most successful deals involved the acquisition of Executive Life Insurance Company's bond portfolio. Using this vehicle, Apollo would purchase the Executive Life portfolio, generating tremendous profits when the value of high yield bonds recovered, but also resulting in a variety of state regulatory issues for Apollo and Credit Lyonnais over the purchase. More than a decade after the purchase, in 2002, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer accused Apollo, Leon Black, and an investor group led by French bank Credit Lyonnais, of illegally acquiring the assets and bond portfolio of Executive Life Insurance Co. in 1991. According to the State of California, Lion allegedly violated a California law that prohibited foreign government-owned banks from owning California insurance companies.|$|R
50|$|Supported by a {{considerable}} number of adherents in battle array, and accompanied by the abbot, the royal party moved onwards for Dumbarton, where help from France was expected. They were, however, intercepted by the regent's forces, and a desperate battle ensued. The queen stood near a yew tree, guarded by her devoted admirer George Douglas in close armour, while her page pushed forward to watch the conflict. It had lasted nearly an hour, when Sir Halbert attacked the flank of Mary's supporters, and they were completely routed, Henry Seyton was killed, and Douglas, who was mortally wounded, expired without withdrawing his eyes from her face. Hopeless of further aid, the queen adopted <b>the</b> fatal <b>resolution</b> of <b>trusting</b> to Elizabeth's mercy, and, having bid adieu to her followers, took ship for England.

25|$|Starr {{took the}} {{position}} part-time and remained active with his law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, {{as this was}} permitted by statute and was also the norm with previous independent counsel investigations. As time went on, however, Starr was increasingly criticized for alleged conflicts of interest stemming from his continuing association with Kirkland & Ellis. Kirkland, like several other major law firms, was representing clients in litigation with the government, including tobacco companies and auto manufacturers. The firm itself was being sued by <b>the</b> <b>Resolution</b> <b>Trust</b> Company, a government agency involved in the Whitewater matter. Additionally, Starr's own actions were challenged because Starr had, on one occasion, talked with lawyers for Paula Jones, who was suing Bill Clinton over an alleged sexual assault.

500|$|One case {{filed by}} the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was settled in 1994: Keating said he was {{bankrupt}} but agreed to repay millions should any hidden assets be discovered. A third case filed by <b>the</b> <b>Resolution</b> <b>Trust</b> Corporation resulted in a summary judgment of $4.3 billion against Keating and his wife in 1994, the largest judgment ever against a private person. The judgment was overturned on appeal in 1999, on grounds that Keating could not be held personally liable to the government without a specific criminal conviction or some other decision at trial. [...] Throughout his incarceration, Keating maintained his innocence, saying he was a [...] "political prisoner" [...] of the U.S. government and a scapegoat for the largest banking scandal in the nation's history.|$|E

2500|$|The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) {{had been}} created to insure {{deposits}} held by savings and loan institutions ("S", or [...] "thrifts"). [...] Because of a confluence of events, much of the S industry was insolvent, and many large banks were in trouble as well.

The primary legislative responses to the crisis were the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). Federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and state-chartered thrifts by the FDIC.|$|E
