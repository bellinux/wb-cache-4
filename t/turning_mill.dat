50|$|Millville grew {{starting}} in the 1810s through its access to the water power of Fish Creek and two other streams nearby. In its early years, its name was evident from the three sawmills, gristmill and <b>turning</b> <b>mill</b> in the settlement. Later, the clearing of land for farms reduced {{the flow of the}} streams and it could not support as many mills.|$|E
40|$|<b>Turn</b> <b>milling</b> {{is still}} a {{relatively}} un common process for precision manufacturing of axially symmetric components. In this process, chip formation is realized by a combined rotation of the workpiece and the cutting tool. Due to its special kinematics, <b>turn</b> <b>milling</b> offers potential for cutting of difficult-to-machine materials, such as particle reinforced aluminium matrix composites. The heterogeneous microstructure of these materials with comparatively soft matrix and hard ceramic particles causes high dynamic loads on the cutting edges. Furthermore, the cutting edges have to withstand the highly abrasive effect of the hard particles. This requires the application of wear-resistant cutting materials, including particularly diamond-based cutting materials. However, their use as tippings imposes design limitations for the cutting tools. In this investigation, cutting tests on an aluminium alloy reinforced with 15 per cent by volume alumina particles were performed using end mills with different minor cutting edge angles in orthogonal and tangential <b>turn</b> <b>milling.</b> After a short cutting time, during tangential <b>turn</b> <b>milling</b> the flat cutting edge geometry resulted in vibrations of the tool and a poor workpiece surface quality. In contrast, orthogonal <b>turn</b> <b>milling</b> produced no vibrations and enabled higher feed velocities when reducing the minor cutting edge angles from 1 ° to 0 °...|$|R

50|$|Hutton's mill, on Rose Valley Road by Vernon Run, {{was built}} about 1840 as a feed mill. In 1847 {{it became a}} <b>turning</b> <b>mill.</b> It was used to produce bobbins for the nearby textile mill as well as serving as a warehouse. Later it {{produced}} sandpaper. Will Price also reconstructed this mill into a meeting house and theater. It also suffered fire damage, was again reconstructed, and now houses the Hedgerow Theatre.|$|E
50|$|Polygonally {{turned parts}} may have several points, teeth, {{or other forms}} at the ends or along their circumference. The {{technique}} requires synchronisation of {{the movement of the}} polygonal <b>turning</b> <b>mill</b> and the part being machined. Polygonal turning allows rapid production and clean machining of advanced geometries. The polygon turning unit has a multitude of inserts, and is synchronized so that when an insert cuts the turning bar stock, it cuts the bar at the same radial position each time the workpiece rotates. This enables geometries such as hexes, squares and flats to be machined at faster speeds than by milling.|$|E
5000|$|Millville is a hamlet in {{the town}} of Shelby in Orleans County, New York, United States. [...] First settled in the mid-1810s, Millville grew {{as a result of the}} mills located there to tap the {{abundant}} water available in the three streams that run through the hamlet. In its early days, before the clearing of the land reduced the volume and regularity of the water volume in the streams, the hamlet could claim three saw mills, a grist mill and a <b>turning</b> <b>mill.</b> In the 1870s, the hamlet had an academy, three churches, a grocery, dry goods store, tannery, foundry, wagon shop, school, post office, and a cluster of about 30 houses. [...] In 2007, the Millville Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

50|$|Around {{the turn}} of the nineteenth century, Abbotsford {{resident}} Charles Hill-Tout opened a sawmill on the shores of Mill Lake, and it contributed over 50,000 railway ties to the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1903, brothers Joe, Richard Arthur, Sam and Bill Trethewey purchased the mill, and in 1912 opened the Abbotsford Timber and Trading Company. This company swiftly became one of the highest employers in all of British Columbia, producing 20 million feet of timber boards per year. The lake was used to sort the logs that arrived by rail, where they were processed and sent to primarily American markets. The mill remained active until 1934, when the Great Depression and the depletion of local forests forced the brothers to close the site. The Abbotsford Lions Club purchased the site, removed the mill equipment, and began the process of <b>turning</b> <b>Mill</b> Lake into a park, bringing in sand and grass locations for visitors.|$|E
5000|$|The {{village of}} Freedom was {{established}} {{in part because of}} a significant water drop (about 70 ft) on Sandy Stream in a relatively short distance, providing an ideal location for early grist- and sawmills. During the 19th century this area supported a number of diverse water-powered operations, all of whose structures have either been demolished or significantly altered. This mill was built in 1834 by John True, owner of another gristmill on the stream, and was also initially used for milling grain. In 1894, with local agriculture in decline, the mill was converted into a <b>turning</b> <b>mill,</b> producing tool handles and other items. A sawmill was built across the stream to cut raw lumber into stock for its operations; this mill, and a building that joined the two by spanning the stream, have not survived. This mill was closed in 1969 and abandoned. [...] It has since been converted into a restaurant, school, and other businesses.|$|E
50|$|Mount Pleasant Mill {{worked by}} wind until 1933 {{and by a}} diesel single {{cylinder}} Crossley engine until 1973. Fred Banks, who ran it then, also owned Alford Windmill. It is the only windmill in the area beside Heapham Mill with original and unrestored equipment and machinery of the 1920s and 1930s. The original cap with the oak cap frame is still in place. The original windshaft, wallower, upright shaft and great spur wheel are made of cast iron, as are the tooth ring of the wooden brakewheel with its timber clasp arm construction and wooden brake, all installed in the 1930s. A refinement to the mill is the elevator to replace the old sack hoist which worked off {{the underside of the}} wallower by a friction ring, and the elevator to feed the first floor bin (3rd floor) for the hurst frame. This is a massive timber frame supporting the transfer gearing and heavy mill stones casings, helping to reduce the vibration of the <b>turning</b> <b>mill</b> stones and their wheels (stone nuts). It is a separate structure inside the mill tower thus reducing the transfer of vibrations and noise into the building itself.|$|E

5000|$|The Burlington Landlocked Forest, {{also known}} as the Burlington Landlocked Parcel, {{consists}} of 270 acre spanning the borders of Burlington, Bedford, and Lexington, and contains 12 mi of hiking-mountain biking trails, vernal pools, abundant wildlife, historic stone walls and other structures, meadows, and old-growth forest. The majority of the land is owned by the Town of Burlington, which has kept it as open space since acquiring it by eminent domain in 1985. It borders Route 3 in Burlington to the east, Route 62 in Bedford to the north, conservation land in Lexington to the west and Route 128 to the South. The main trail head to the Forest is located at the intersection of Routes 3 and 62 in Bedford. A secondary trail head can be found on <b>Turning</b> <b>Mill</b> Road in Lexington, under the power lines {{at the site of the}} future West Lexington Greenway. The Landlocked Parcel is currently not protected land and there were discussions in 2008 between the Town of Burlington and Patriot Partners to sell the land to the developer who would develop part of the forest to build a large biotechnology complex. A citizen group, Friends of the Burlington Landlocked Forest, has been organized to prevent this sale and to make the Forest designated conservation land.|$|E
