40|$|The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has {{endorsed}} a concept for future aeronautical communications, which uses digital data links to supplement voice communications and provide improved air trafiic services. A {{necessary part of}} this concept is an international infrastructure that manages digital data transfer between aircrafi and civil air <b>trafic</b> <b>control</b> facilities. This communications infrastructure is the Aeronautical Telecommunication Network (ATN). It is the intention of certain ICAO member states to provide air trafic services (A TS) that require ATN avionics. As the civil-controlled airspace moves toward requiring new communication capabilities, the militaq will need to accommodate the A TN if worldwide-unrestricted airspac...|$|E
40|$|Performing {{dependability}} evaluation {{along with}} other analyses at architectural level allows both predicting the effects of architectural decisions on the dependability of a system and making tradeoffs. Thus, both industry and academia focus on defining model driven engineering (MDE) approaches and on integrating several analyses in the development process. AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) {{has proved to be}} efficient for architectural modeling and is considered by industry in the context presented above. Our contribution is a modeling framework allowing the generation of dependability-oriented analytical models from AADL models, to facilitate the evaluation of dependability measures, such as reliability or availability. We propose an iterative approach for system dependability modeling using AADL. In this context, we also provide a set of reusable modeling patterns for fault tolerant architectures. The AADL dependability model is transformed into a GSPN (Generalized Stochastic Petri Net) by applying model transformation rules. We have implemented an automatic model transformation tool. The resulting GSPN can be processed by existing tools to obtain dependability measures. The modeling approach is illustrated on a subsystem of the French Air <b>trafic</b> <b>Control</b> System...|$|E
40|$|The Available-Bit-Rate (ABR) {{service that}} is being {{standardized}} by the ATM Forum dynamically deter-mines the maximum transmission rate, so-called ezplicit rate, of a connection. A drawback of the ABR con-trol scheme for calculating the explicit rates is that it tries to allocate the. same bandwidth to all ABR connec-tions regardless of the application type of the connec-tion. In this study a multi-level explicit rate scheme is proposed that can allocate d#erent explicit rates for dif-ferent classes of connections. ABR <b>trafic</b> is <b>controlled</b> at three levels. A 2 the topmost level, bandwidth is dy-namically regulated between CBR, VBR, and ABR traf-fic sources. At the next level, bandwidth is controlled between different classes of ABR trafic. At the lowest level, bandwidth is distributed among connections be-longing to the same ABR trafic class. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in simulation experiments. ...|$|R

Stabilization of MB-NCSs is studied using feedback controls and simulation of stabilization for different feedbacks {{is made with}} the purpose to reduce the network <b>trafic.</b> The feedback <b>control</b> input is applied in a compensated model of the plant that approximates the plant dynamics and stabilizes the plant even under slow network conditions. Conditions for global exponential stabilizability and for the choosing of a feedback control input for a given constant time between the information moments of the network are derived.

40|$|Advances in DNA {{sequencing}} technology facilitate investigating {{the impact of}} rare variants on complex diseases. However, using a conventional case‐control design, large samples are needed to capture enough rare variants to achieve sufficient power for testing the association between suspected loci and complex diseases. In such large samples, population stratification may easily cause spurious signals. One approach to overcome stratification {{is to use a}} family‐based design. For rare variants, this strategy is especially appropriate, as power can be increased considerably by analyzing cases with affected relatives. We propose a novel framework for association testing in affected sibpairs by comparing the allele count of rare variants on chromosome regions shared identical by descent to the allele count of rare variants on nonshared chromosome regions, referred to as test for rare variant association with family‐based internal <b>control</b> (<b>TRAFIC).</b> This design is generally robust to population stratification as cases and controls are matched within each sibpair. We evaluate the power analytically using general model for effect size of rare variants. For the same number of genotyped people, TRAFIC shows superior power over the conventional case‐control study for variants with summed risk allele frequency f< 0. 05; this power advantage is even more substantial when considering allelic heterogeneity. For complex models of gene‐gene interaction, this power advantage depends on the direction of interaction and overall heritability. In sum, we introduce a new method for analyzing rare variants in affected sibpairs that is robust to population stratification, and provide freely available software...|$|R

A n ATX sys-tem needs a sophisticated and real-time connection ad-misszon controller {{not only to}} guarantee the required quality-of-service (QoS) for existing calls but also to raise the system efficiency. Input process has a power-speciral-density (PSD) which explicitly contains the correlation behavior of input trafic and has {{a great impact on}} the system performance. Also, a neural network has bccn widely applied to deal with <b>trafic</b> <b>control</b> related problems in ATM systems because of its self-learning capability. In this paper, we propose a PSD-based neural-net connection admission control (PNCAC) mdhod for an ATM system. Under the QoS constraint, we construct a decision hyperplane of the connection admission control according to param-eters of the power spectrum. We further adopt the leaming/adapting capabilities of the neural network to adjust the optimum location of the boundary between these two decision spaces. Simulation results show that the PXCA C method provides a superior system utiliza-tion over the conventional CAC schemes b y an amount of 18 %, while keeping the QoS contract. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Molecular {{diffusion}} under confinement by highly ordered nanoporous structures is {{subjected to}} a hierarchy of particle-particle correlations. These correlations result {{in a variety of}} peculiarities of molecular diffusion. Three examples are discussed in detail. As a consequence of the confinement by the host matrix, molecular displacements in different directions often intimately depend on each other, resulting in an interdependence of the principal elements of the dihsion tensor (correlation rule of difision anisotropy). If intrac~ystalline channel systems confine molecular propagation to one direction, molecules with diameters Mciently exceeding the channel radii are subjected to single-jle d~flusion, whose spatial-temporal dependence significantly deviates from normal diffusion. In networks of intersecting single-file systems with different affinities to the reactant and product molecules, the interplay of diffusion and reaction leads to deviations from a homogeneous pore filling over the sample and to an enhanced output of reaction products in comparison with channel networks of equal adsorption affinities (reactivity enhancement by molecular <b>trafic</b> <b>control).</b> The presented theoretical concepts are compared with experimental results, in particular with the findings of pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR diffusion studies. 1...|$|E
40|$|Based on an Air Trufic example we {{illustrate}} {{issues of}} Domain Analysis (of: air space, time tables, and traffic), and of Requirements Capture (of: scheduling systems, and of air <b>trafic</b> <b>control).</b> We relate {{also to the}} issue of Software Architecture. 1 An overview of an example method We explore a method for developing software for an air traffic system in which a Software Architecture is developed from a Requirements Capture, which is again developed from a Domain Analysis. The principles according to which the techniques are applied, are only claimed relevant wrt. the specif 5 c example. We have however also applied basically these principles to other infrastructure systems (railways, toll-ways, manufacturing industries, etc.). The techniques and the tools used are those of the RAISE method, [ll], respectively RSL, the RAISE Specification Language, [lo]. RAISE is a comprehensive method for software development. 1. 1 Application domain analysis By ‘domain ’ we loosely mean an application area, such as railways, air transport, manufacturing, health care, libraries, etc. By a ‘domain analysis ’ we understand first an identification of the system (i. e. the domain) to be described, then the informal and formal description of (parts) of that domain- possibly adorned with theorems (about the domain) and possibly their proof. Each domain component is formally described and thus Domain Analysis creates theories of the domain- much like Maxwell’s Equations form a theory of electro-magnetic wave propagation irrespective of any radio communication application...|$|E
