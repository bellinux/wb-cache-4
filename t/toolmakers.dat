25|$|The conduit-metaphor {{paradigm}} {{states that}} communication failure needs explanation, because success should be automatic: materials are naturally gathered, but misguided people expend energy scattering them. Conversely, the <b>toolmakers</b> paradigm states that partial miscommunication is inherent {{and can only}} be fixed by continuous effort and extensive verbal interaction: materials are gathered using energy or they will be naturally scattered.|$|E
25|$|Evidence of the biasing {{power of}} the conduit metaphor {{can be found in}} fields outside of linguistics. Information theory, with its concept-free {{algorithms}} and computers as models, would seem to be immune from effects arising from semantic pathology, because the framework shares many attributes with the <b>toolmakers</b> paradigm. Nevertheless, there is evidence that use of the conduit metaphor has hampered investigators' attempts to develop the theory.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>toolmakers</b> paradigm, {{words do}} not contain ideas, so POEM1 cannot contain POEM2; therefore, a {{distinction}} between them must be preserved. Although {{there is only one}} POEM1 in most cases, the differences in mental content among people (and the difficult task of assembling it based on instructions in the text) mean that there are as many POEM2s as there are people. These internal POEM2s will only come to resemble one another after people expend effort comparing their mental content.|$|E

50|$|Mares {{started his}} working {{life as a}} <b>toolmaker</b> in Prague, and was {{exceptionally}} skilled in this area, reaching the rank of <b>Toolmaker</b> First Class prior to the Prague Spring of 1968. Mares recalled going to work one morning during this time to find several tanks parked outside the factory at which he worked. It was during this time that Mares' tools were stolen, leaving him with a debt to the state {{that had to be}} paid off. Mares and another <b>toolmaker</b> worked nights until the debt was paid, and he then decided to leave Czechoslovakia and emigrate.|$|R

25|$|The Mode 2 Acheulean <b>toolmakers</b> {{also used}} the Mode 1 flake tool method but {{supplemented}} it by using bone, antler, or wood to shape stone tools. This type of hammer, compared to stone, yields {{more control over the}} shape of the finished tool. Unlike the earlier Mode 1 industries, it was the core that was prized over the flakes that came from it. Another advance was that the Mode 2 tools were worked symmetrically and on both sides indicating greater care in the production of the final tool.|$|E
25|$|Tool types {{found in}} Acheulean assemblages include pointed, cordate, ovate, ficron, and bout-coupé hand-axes (referring to {{the shapes of}} the final tool), cleavers, {{retouched}} flakes, scrapers, and segmental chopping tools. Materials used were determined by available local stone types; flint is most often associated with the tools but its use is concentrated in Western Europe; in Africa sedimentary and igneous rock such as mudstone and basalt were most widely used, for example. Other source materials include chalcedony, quartzite, andesite, sandstone, chert, and shale. Even relatively soft rock such as limestone could be exploited. In all cases the <b>toolmakers</b> worked their handaxes close to the source of their raw materials, suggesting that the Acheulean was a set of skills passed between individual groups.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1980s, it {{was thought}} that the humans who arrived in East Asia {{abandoned}} the hand-axe technology of their ancestors and adopted chopper tools instead. An apparent division between Acheulean and non-Acheulean tool industries was identified by Hallam L. Movius, who drew the Movius Line across northern India to show where the traditions seemed to diverge. Later finds of Acheulean tools at Chongokni in South Korea and also in Mongolia and China, however, cast doubt on the reliability of Movius's distinction. Since then, a different division known as the Roe Line has been suggested. This runs across North Africa to Israel and thence to India, separating two different techniques used by Acheulean <b>toolmakers.</b> North and east of the Roe Line, Acheulean hand-axes were made directly from large stone nodules and cores; while, to the south and west, they were made from flakes struck from these nodules.|$|E

25|$|In 1836, an American, Samuel Colt {{patented}} {{the mechanism}} {{that led to}} the widespread use of the revolver, the mechanically indexing cylinder. According to Samuel Colt, he {{came up with the idea}} for the revolver while at sea, inspired by the capstan, which had a ratchet and pawl mechanism on it, a version of which was used in his guns to rotate the cylinder by cocking the hammer. This provided a reliable and repeatable way to index each round and did away with the need to manually rotate the cylinder. Revolvers proliferated largely due to Colt's ability as a salesman. But his influence spread in other ways as well; the build quality of his company's guns became famous, and its armories in America and England trained several seminal generations of <b>toolmakers</b> and other machinists, who had great influence in other manufacturing efforts of the next half century.|$|E
