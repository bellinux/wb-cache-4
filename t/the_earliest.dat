5|$|Balangoda Man (Homo sapiens balangodensis) {{refers to}} hominins from Sri Lanka's late Quaternary period.

Cultural remains discovered alongside the skeletal fragments include geometric microliths dating to 28,500 BP, which together with some sites in Africa is <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> record of such stone tools.|$|E

The primary extant specimens of cannon from the 13th century are the Wuwei Bronze Cannon dated to 1227, the Heilongjiang hand cannon dated to 1288, and the Xanadu Gun dated to 1298.

The Xanadu Gun is 34.7cm in length and weighs 6.2kg. The other cannon are dated using contextual evidence.|$|E
