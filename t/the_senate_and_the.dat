5|$|Kennedy's role as {{a liberal}} lion in the Senate {{came to the fore}} in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and {{legislation}} intending to fulfill the Contract with America was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. Many Democrats in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans. By the beginning of 1996, the Republicans had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy's staff.|$|E

5|$|The {{order of}} sejm {{proceedings}} was formalized in the 17th century. The lower chamber would {{do most of}} the statute preparation work. The last several days were spent working together with <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> king, when the final versions were agreed upon and decisions made; the finished legislative product had to have the consent of all three legislating estates of the realm, the Sejm, <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> monarch. The lower chamber's rule of unanimity had not been rigorously enforced {{during the first half of}} the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|After Actium and {{the defeat}} of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was in a {{position}} to rule the entire Republic under an unofficial principate—but he had to achieve this through incremental power gains. He did so by courting <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> people while upholding the republican traditions of Rome, appearing that he was not aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy. Marching into Rome, Octavian and Marcus Agrippa were elected as dual consuls by the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Article IX {{involves}} {{amendments to}} the New Jersey state constitution. A potential amendment is submitted through the Senate or General Assembly. The amendment is voted upon by both of the houses. If it gathers at least three-fifths of both <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly, the amendment is to be submitted to be voted upon {{by the people of}} New Jersey. If a majority votes for the amendment, the amendment is passed on the thirtieth day after the vote.|$|E

5|$|Despite Nerva's {{measures}} to remain popular with <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Roman people, support for Domitian remained {{strong in the}} army, which had called for his deification immediately after the assassination. In an attempt to appease the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard, Nerva had dismissed their prefect Titus Petronius Secundus—one of the chief conspirators against Domitian—and replaced him with a former commander, Casperius Aelianus.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to South Australia to assist Charles Kingston in his government, but ultimately crossed {{the floor to}} bring down Kingston over his plans to lessen {{the power of the}} Legislative Council. With the advent of Australian Federation, Playford became a Senator for South Australia. He was leader of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 7th Minister for Defence. After one term as a Senator, Playford was defeated. He ran again in 1910, was unsuccessful, and retired to Kent Town, where he died in 1915 at the age of 78.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{ownership}} {{and maintenance of}} NY360 was transferred {{from the state of}} New York to Monroe County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government.

The act was signed into law by Governor Eliot Spitzer on August28. Under the terms of the act, it took effect 90 days after it was signed into law; thus, the maintenance swap officially took place on November26, 2007.|$|E

5|$|In Australia, a {{technical}} issue arose with the royal assent in both 1976 and 2001. In 1976, a bill {{originating in the}} House of Representatives was mistakenly submitted to the Governor-General and assented to. However, it was later discovered {{that it had not}} been passed by the Senate. The error arose because two bills of the same title had originated from the House. The Governor-General revoked the first assent, before assenting to the bill which had actually passed <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> House. The same procedure was followed to correct a similar error which arose in 2001.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{the formal}} {{ceremony}} of granting assent in parliament {{has not been}} regularly used since the early 20th century. Now, the bill {{is sent to the}} governor-general's residence by the house in which it originated. The governor-general then signs the bill, sending messages to the president of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> speaker of the House of Representatives, who notify their respective houses of the governor-general's action. A similar practice is followed in New Zealand, where the governor-general has not granted the Royal Assent in person in parliament since 1875.|$|E
5|$|Jordan is {{a unitary}} state under a {{constitutional}} monarchy. Jordan's constitution, adopted in 1952 and amended {{a number of}} times since, is the legal framework that governs the monarch, government, bicameral legislature and judiciary. The king retains wide executive and legislative powers from the government and parliament. The king exercises his powers through the government that he appoints for a four-year term, which is responsible before the parliament that is made up of two chambers: <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> House of Representatives. The judiciary is independent according to the constitution.|$|E

5|$|Madagascar is a semi-presidential {{representative}} democratic multi-party republic, {{wherein the}} popularly elected {{president is the}} head of state and selects a prime minister, who recommends candidates to the president to form his cabinet of ministers. According to the constitution, executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the ministerial cabinet, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> National Assembly, although in reality these two latter bodies have very little power or legislative role. The constitution establishes independent executive, legislative and judicial branches and mandates a popularly elected president limited to three five-year terms.|$|E
5|$|On 9 June 68, amid growing {{opposition}} of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> army, Nero committed suicide {{and with him}} the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end.

5|$|Other {{theories}} include André Chastagnol's minimalist {{opinion that}} the author was a pagan who supported <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Roman aristocracy and scorned the lower classes and the barbarian races, while François Paschoud proposed that the last books of the History are in fact a type of alternative historical narrative, with events and the personalities of recent 4th century emperors woven {{into the fabric of}} a series of 3rd century emperors. According to Paschoud, the representation of the emperor Probus is in fact a version of Julian, with Carus substituting for Valentinian I and Carinus for Gratian.|$|E
