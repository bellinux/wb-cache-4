In this case, a licensing committee exercising statutory powers to license cinemas {{to be used for}} film screenings had imposed a condition in a licence that films had to be certified by the British Board of Film Censors before they could be shown. This was found to be ultra vires because the Board should not be made the final dictator. Furthermore, the fact that the Board had been given absolute power to prohibit films for reasons which might be private or influenced by trade considerations was sufficient to render the condition ultra vires.|$|E

5|$|Lotus Temple, is a Bahá'í House of Worship {{completed}} in 1986. Notable for its flowerlike shape, {{it serves as}} the Mother Temple of the Indian subcontinent {{and has become a}} prominent attraction in the city. The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and been featured in hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles. Like all other Bahá'í Houses of Worship, is open to all regardless of religion, or any other distinction, as emphasised in Bahá'í texts. The Bahá'í laws emphasise that the spirit of the House of Worship be that it is a gathering place where people of all religions may worship God without denominational restrictions. The Bahá'í laws also stipulate that only the holy scriptures of the Bahá'í Faith and other religions can be read or chanted inside in any language; while readings and prayers can be set to music by choirs, no musical instruments can be played inside. Furthermore, no sermons can be delivered, and <b>there</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> ritualistic ceremonies practised.|$|E

5|$|Alone with Shuu, Ryouta finally remembers {{what he had}} {{forgotten}} due to the traumatic nature of the events: he recognizes the doctor {{as a man who}} promised to grant his wish for peace between birds and humans after he and the protagonist witnessed a human terrorist incident at a bird orphanage in which the protagonist's parents, crisis negotiators, were killed, and that the protagonist died when she visited him in the infirmary. It is revealed that she died by Charon virus after coming in contact with Ryouta, as Shuu had induced the virus into Ryouta's body though grafts from Nageki's remains for the purpose of using him to exterminate humanity—since <b>there</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> more fighting between two factions if one is wiped out, this would grant Ryouta's wish. Shuu then remarks that Labor 9 was powered by the protagonist's now irreversibly damaged brain. A broken Ryouta submits to Shuu's offer of becoming a living weapon of mass destruction after these revelations, and a struggle ensues during which the protagonist's spirit intervenes. Ryouta then asks Shuu why he decided to grant his wish, to which it is implied that Shuu's affection towards Ryouta's deceased father, Ryuuji, was greater than Shuu himself would like to admit, and that he was motivated by Ryuuji's dying request: to do something for his son.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world that <b>there</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims {{that there should be no}} reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E
