5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> of the Washington Metro in the United States {{consists}} of 27 rapid transit stations from Franconia–Springfield to Largo Town Center. It has stations in Fairfax County, Alexandria and Arlington, Virginia, the District of Columbia, and Prince George's County, Maryland. Thirteen of the line's stations are {{shared with the}} Orange Line, 16 are shared with the Silver Line and 7 are shared with the Yellow Line. Only three stations are exclusive to <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Line.</b>|$|E
5|$|Community Transit {{has also}} {{proposed}} extending <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> on State Route 99 through Shoreline to Link Light Rail at NE 185th Street station {{when it opens}} {{as part of the}} Lynnwood Link Extension in 2023.|$|E
5|$|Extensions to both Metro {{lines are}} planned as of September 2017. <b>The</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> {{extension}} will branch northward from the Target Field station, adding 11 stations to the line: two more in Minneapolis, two in Golden Valley, one each in Robbinsdale and Crystal, and five in Brooklyn Park. The Green Line extension will branch west from Target Field station and include 15 new stations: five in Minneapolis, three each in Saint Louis Park and Hopkins, one in Minnetonka, and three in Eden Prairie. The Metropolitan Council estimated in 2017 that the Green Line extension {{will be open}} for passenger service in 2021 and <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> extension {{will be ready for}} passenger service the following year.|$|E
50|$|One {{possible}} {{reason for this}} illusion is that the diagonal <b>lines</b> around <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>lines</b> give a perception of depth, and when <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>lines</b> are included in that depth, they are perceived as different lengths.|$|R

5|$|In {{terms of}} WMATA's {{internal}} route designations, <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> service travels along {{the entirety of}} the J Route (from the terminus at Franconia-Springfield to the C & J junction just south of King Street), part of the C Route (from the C & J junction just south of King Street to Metro Center), part of the D Route (from Metro Center to the D & G Junction just east of Stadium-Armory) and the entire G Route (from the D & G junction past Stadium-Armory to the terminus at Largo Town Center). <b>The</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> needs 23 six-car trains (138 rail cars) to run at peak capacity.|$|E

5|$|Swift {{carried a}} total of 1,621,838 riders on <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> in 2015, making it the most popular route {{operated}} by Community Transit, and accounting for 16.2% of the agency's total ridership.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> was {{originally}} planned {{to follow a}} slightly different route. The plan would have sent Blue Line trains to Huntington, with Yellow Line trains serving Franconia–Springfield. This was changed due to a shortage of rail cars {{at the time of}} the completion of the line to Huntington. Because fewer rail cars were required to operate Yellow Line service than would be required to run Blue Line service out to Huntington – due to the Yellow Line's shorter route – the line designations were switched. From 1999 to 2008, <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> operated to Huntington on July 4, as part of Metro's special Independence Day service pattern.|$|E
5|$|The British moved three fresh brigades {{up to the}} Red Line by 9:30am on 10 April {{to support}} the advance of the 1st and 2nd Canadian Division, whereupon they were to {{leapfrog}} existing units occupying the Red line and advance to <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Line.</b> Fresh units including two sections of tanks and the 13th British Brigade were called up from reserve to support the advance of the 2nd Canadian Division. By approximately 11:00am, <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Line,</b> including Hill 135 and the village of Thélus, had been captured. To permit the troops time to consolidate <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Line,</b> the advance halted and the barrage remained stationary for 90 minutes while machine guns were brought forward. Shortly before 1:00pm, the advance recommenced with both the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions reporting their final objective. The tank-supported advance via Farbus and directed {{at the rear of}} the 79th Reserve Division, was eventually halted by concentrated German fire short of the village. The Canadian 1st and 2nd Divisions were nonetheless able to secure the Brown Line by approximately 2:00pm.|$|E

5|$|The Rush+ {{realignment}} {{was intended}} to free up space in the Rosslyn Portal (the tunnel between Rosslyn and Foggy Bottom), which operates at full capacity already. When Silver Line service began, those trains would be routed through the tunnel, and so some of what were Blue Line trains to Largo Town Center were now diverted across the Fenwick Bridge to become Yellow Line trains running {{all the way up}} the Green Line to Greenbelt. Select Yellow Line trains running south diverted along <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> to Franconia-Springfield (as opposed to the normal Yellow line terminus at Huntington). Until the start of Silver Line service, excess Rosslyn Tunnel capacity was used by additional Orange Line trains that traveled along <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> to Largo (as opposed to the normal Orange Line terminus at New Carrollton). Rush+ had the additional effect of giving some further number of passengers transfer-free journeys, though severely increasing headways for the portion of <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> running between Pentagon and Rosslyn. In May 2017, Metro announced that Yellow Rush+ service would be eliminated effective June 25, 2017.|$|E

5|$|Forty {{tanks of}} the 1st Brigade {{were to be}} used in the attack on the Third Army front, eight with XVIII Corps and sixteen each in VII Corps and VI Corps. When <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>line</b> had been reached, four of the VII Corps tanks were to join VI Corps for its attack on the brown line. The black line (first objective) was not to be {{attacked}} by tanks, which were to begin the drive to the front line at zero-hour and rendezvous with infantry at the black line two hours later. The tanks were reserved for the most difficult objectives beyond the black line in groups of up to ten vehicles. Four tanks were to attack Neuville Vitasse, four against Telegraph Hill, four against The Harp and another four against Tilloy lez Mofflaines and two were to drive down the slope from Roclincourt west of Bois de la Maison Blanche. Once <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>line</b> had fallen, the tanks still running were to drive to rally points.|$|E
