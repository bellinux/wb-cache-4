5|$|The Norman Cob is {{also used}} for riding, and {{may be used for}} most equestrian disciplines. It is {{particularly}} well suited for vaulting. Elderly and nervous riders often appreciate the breed's calm temperament. Lighter Cobs can be used for mounted hunts. Crosses between the Norman Cob and <b>Thoroughbred</b> continue to be made to create saddle horses, generally with 25 to 50 percent Cob blood. Some Norman Cobs are bred for the meat market. The breed is sometimes preferred by butchers because of the lighter carcass weight and increased profitability over the <b>Thoroughbred,</b> {{while at the same time}} retaining meat similar in flavor and appearance to that of the <b>Thoroughbred.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Thoroughbred</b> {{racehorses}} {{perform with}} maximum exertion, which {{has resulted in}} high accident rates and health problems such as bleeding from the lungs. Other health concerns include low fertility, abnormally small hearts and a small hoof-to-body-mass ratio. There are several theories for the reasons behind the prevalence of accidents and health problems in the <b>Thoroughbred</b> breed, and research is ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Thoroughbreds in the United States have {{historically}} been used not only for racing but also to improve other breeds. The early import Messenger was {{the foundation of the}} Standardbred, and <b>Thoroughbred</b> blood was also instrumental {{in the development of the}} American Quarter Horse. The foundation stallion of the Morgan breed is held by some to have been sired by a <b>Thoroughbred.</b> Between World War I and World War II, the U.S. Army used <b>Thoroughbred</b> stallions as part of their Remount Service, which was designed to improve the stock of cavalry mounts.|$|E

5|$|Unlike many {{high-end}} California <b>Thoroughbred</b> trainers, {{who usually}} are headquartered at Santa Anita Park, the Shermans kept horses at Hollywood Park, {{but when it}} closed in December 2013, Los Alamitos Race Course picked {{up some of the}} <b>Thoroughbred</b> races and trainers who had stabled horses at Hollywood Park, including Sherman. The success of California Chrome, who was conditioned there over the track that had been recently expanded to accommodate longer races, created good publicity for Los Alamitos.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} crossbreeding influence used {{to revitalize}} the Appaloosa was the Arabian horse, as evidenced by early registration lists that show Arabian-Appaloosa crossbreeds as ten of the first fifteen horses registered with the ApHC. For example, one of Claude Thompson's major herd sires was Ferras, an Arabian stallion bred by W.K. Kellogg from horses imported from the Crabbet Arabian Stud of England. Ferras sired Red Eagle, a prominent Appaloosa stallion added to the Appaloosa Hall of Fame in 1988. Later, <b>Thoroughbred</b> and Quarter Horse lines were added, as well as crosses from other breeds, including Morgans and Standardbreds. In 1983 the ApHC {{reduced the number of}} allowable outcrosses to three main breeds: the Arabian horse, the American Quarter Horse and the <b>Thoroughbred.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Jersey Act was {{introduced}} to prevent the registration of most American-bred <b>Thoroughbred</b> horses in the British General Stud Book. It had {{its roots in the}} desire of the British to halt the influx of American-bred racehorses of possibly impure bloodlines during the early 20th century. Many American-bred horses were exported to Europe to race and retire to a breeding career after a number of US states banned gambling, which depressed <b>Thoroughbred</b> racing as well as breeding in the United States. The loss of breeding records during the American Civil War and the late beginning of the registration of American Thoroughbreds led many in the British racing establishment to doubt that the American-bred horses were purebred.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Thoroughbred</b> as it {{is known}} today was {{developed}} in 17th- and 18th-century England, when native mares were crossbred with imported Oriental stallions of Arabian, Barb, and Turkoman breeding. All modern Thoroughbreds can trace their pedigrees to three stallions originally imported into England in the 17th century and 18th century and to a larger number of foundation mares of mostly English breeding. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the <b>Thoroughbred</b> breed spread throughout the world; they were imported into North America starting in 1730 and into Australia, Europe, Japan and South America during the 19th century. Millions of Thoroughbreds exist today, and around 100,000foals are registered each year worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, {{horses were}} {{harvested}} from the feral herds {{and used as}} riding and stock horses, {{as well as being}} used for their meat, hair and hides. Originally there were many herds that roamed land owned by the British Crown and the native Māori, but many were eradicated with the intensification of large scale farming and forestry operations combined with increased mechanization that decreased the need for stock horses. Kaimanawa horses today have the highest amount of genetic similarity with the <b>Thoroughbred</b> and other <b>Thoroughbred</b> cross breeds.|$|E

5|$|Although the <b>Thoroughbred</b> is {{primarily}} bred for racing, the breed {{is also used}} for show jumping and combined training because of its athleticism, and many retired and retrained race horses become fine family riding horses, dressage horses, and youth show horses.

5|$|Because of {{the genetic}} {{strength}} of the desert-bred Arabian horse, Arabian bloodlines have {{played a part in}} the development of nearly every modern light horse breed, including the <b>Thoroughbred,</b> Orlov Trotter, Morgan, American Saddlebred, American Quarter Horse, and Warmblood breeds such as the Trakehner. Arabian bloodlines have also influenced the development of the Welsh Pony, the Australian Stock Horse, Percheron draft horse, Appaloosa, and the Colorado Ranger Horse.|$|E
