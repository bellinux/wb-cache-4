5|$|Clemson's post-score kickoff was {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech 15-yard line, where the Yellow Jackets began their first offensive possession. On {{the first two}} plays of the game, Georgia Tech running back Roddy Jones escaped the Clemson defense for gains of 21 yards and 22 yards, respectively. Those plays advanced the Yellow Jackets to the Clemson 42-yard line, where Georgia Tech began advancing by small gains. In three plays, Georgia Tech gained a first down, but two subsequent plays lost yardage before kicker Scott Blair came onto the field to attempt—and convert—a 48-yard field goal. The score narrowed Clemson's lead to 7–3 with the quarter exactly half elapsed.|$|E

5|$|The Clemson Tigers {{began the}} game with first possession. After Georgia Tech's kickoff and a short return, the Tigers' offense began work at their 33-yard line.

5|$|The Crimson Tide {{scored on}} its next two {{possessions}} as well, and McCarron completed touchdown passes to running backs Kenyan Drake and Jalston Fowler. With the lead at 35–0 {{late in the}} second quarter, Alabama played its reserves {{for much of the}} remainder of the game. After the Crimson Tide defense forced another punt from the Panthers, McCarron was replaced by backup quarterback Blake Sims. On his first possession at the helm of Alabama's offense, Sims led the team <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> State one-yard line, but a pair of false starts forced Alabama to settle for a field goal that increased the lead to 38–0 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|The Engineering Experiment Station {{was renamed}} the Georgia Tech Research Institute in 1984. A {{separate}} organization, originally called the Industrial Development Council, {{changed its name}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech Research Institute in February 1946, and finally <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech Research Corporation in 1984. There are legal difficulties when an American university wishes to accept contracts from some entities, especially the federal government, so the second organization is a contracting organization. Most importantly, it allows the university to perform multi-year contracts that are not possible under state law, which requires that money received must be spent in the same fiscal year. The name change coincided with a shift in focus toward obtaining industrial research contracts {{in addition to its}} contracts with the federal government. GTRI expanded its footprint in the mid to late 1980s: the Centennial Research Building opened on {{the north end of the}} Georgia Tech campus in 1985, providing expanded lab and office space, and the electromagnetic radiation measurement range was established at GTRI's Cobb County research facility.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Georgia Institute of Technology {{can be traced back}} to Reconstruction-era plans to develop the {{industrial}} base of the Southern United States. Founded on October 13, 1885 in Atlanta as the Georgia School of Technology, the university opened in 1888 after the construction of Tech Tower and a shop building and only offered one degree in mechanical engineering. By 1901, degrees in electrical, civil, textile, and chemical engineering were also offered. In 1948, the name was changed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Institute of Technology to reflect its evolution from an engineering school to a full technical institute and research university.|$|E

5|$|Vernon Jones (born October 31, 1960) is an African-American Democratic {{politician}} {{from the}} US state of Georgia. Jones was {{chief executive officer}} of Dekalb County, Georgia, from 2001 until 2009, and in the Georgia House of Representatives from 1993 to 2001. As Dekalb County CEO, Jones presided over the Board of Commissioners, oversaw a 7,000 employee county workforce, and managed a $2.6 billion county operating budget. He unsuccessfully ran for the US Senate in 2008. After unsuccessful runs for the US House of Representatives (2010) and DeKalb County Sheriff (2014), Jones was elected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> House in 2016.|$|E
5|$|A pair of {{buildings}} bears {{the name of}} Brittain as well. The Dr. Marion Luther Brittain, Sr., House, built in the Neoclassical Revival style and located at 1109 West Peachtree Street in Atlanta, {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places on September 23, 1993. The building served as Brittain's home from its construction in 1911 until Brittain and his family moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech president's house in 1922. It has since been converted into office space and is privately owned. Additionally, the Marion L.

5|$|After a {{successful}} (8–1–1) football season in 1955, Tech {{was invited to}} play in the 1956 Sugar Bowl in New Orleans against the University of Pittsburgh. It would be the school's fifth straight bowl appearance under renowned coach Bobby Dodd. Pittsburgh had a black starting player, fullback Bobby Grier, but as Tech had played a 1953 game against a desegregated Notre Dame team, and the University of Georgia had very recently played out-of-state games against desegregated opponents, president Van Leer and the Tech Athletic Association saw the game's contract as acceptable. However, racial tension in the South was high following the recent Brown v. Board of Education decision. Georgia Governor Marvin Griffin had privately given Dodd his support, but he surprised the campus and the state on Friday, December 2, 1955 by bowing to pressure from segregationists and sending a wire <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Board of Regents chairman, Robert O. Arnold, requesting not only that Tech not play the game, but that all University System of Georgia teams play only segregated games.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} quarter ended in a {{scoreless}} tie, Georgia scored their first touchdown {{early in the second}} quarter. The 19-yard touchdown pass from Aaron Murray to Jay Rome was set up by a fake punt earlier in the drive that gave the Bulldogs a 7–0 lead. After each team again traded punts, Alabama drove the ball to the Bulldogs' one-yard line. However, Eddie Lacy fumbled on second down and then McCarron threw an interception in the endzone to Sanders Commings to end the drive. The Crimson Tide forced another punt on the next Bulldogs possession and Alabama responded on the drive that ensued with their first touchdown of the game on a 41-yard Lacy run that tied the game 7–7. On the next drive, Ha'Sean Clinton-Dix intercepted a Murray pass and returned it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> 47-yard line with just over 1:00 left in the half. Five plays later, Jeremy Shelley connected on a 22-yard field goal as time expired and gave the Crimson Tide a 10–7 halftime lead.|$|E
5|$|Brittain {{was known}} by {{reputation}} as a kind, gentle man and was well liked by students and faculty. He was especially remembered for his dedication <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech Yellow Jackets football team, attending nearly every game including those taking place out-of-state. Outside of Georgia Tech, Brittain taught Sunday school classes and maintained active membership {{in a number of}} service organizations. Brittain retired from his position as president of Georgia Tech in 1944, after which he penned a history of the Institute entitled The Story of Georgia Tech, completed in 1948. He died in 1953, survived by three children: McDonald, Marion Luther, Jr., and Ida, three grandsons, and a great-granddaughter. Flags at the university were flown at half-staff for a month in remembrance of Brittain, and classes were cancelled {{for the rest of the}} school week.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Cyclones' ninth-place {{finish in}} the Big 12 with a 3–6 conference record, their record made them the Big 12's last bowl {{eligible}} team (the only team in the conference {{not to do so}} was the Kansas Jayhawks).

They defeated #13 ranked TCU and Baylor, but lost to Kansas State and Oklahoma State. They lost three of their four games in November, but did manage to defeat Kansas, who were the only Big 12 team to finish with a worse in-conference record than Iowa State. 2012 was the Cyclones' second Liberty Bowl, following the 1972 game in which they lost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech Yellow Jackets by a score of 31–30.|$|E
