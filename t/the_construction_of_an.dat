5|$|An {{aircraft}} {{manufacturing industry}} {{was established in}} the town with <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Airspeed factory at Christchurch Airfield in 1942. In 1948 the factory became part of de Havilland and manufactured a wide range of aircraft such as the Vampire, Sea Venom and Sea Vixen. In the 1950s, Bournemouth Airport, a former RAF base situated on the outskirts of borough boundaries at Hurn, also became heavily involved in aircraft production after Vickers Armstrong—which later became the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC)—established a factory at the airport.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, {{a member}} of the Navy War Board and leading U.S. {{strategic}} thinker, wrote a book titled The Influence of Sea Power upon History in which he argued {{for the creation of a}} large and powerful navy modeled after the British Royal Navy. Part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the Caribbean Sea which would serve as coaling and naval stations, and serve as strategical points of defense upon <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Isthmusian canal.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{the council}} {{announced}} that Denmark Street would be redeveloped by the architectural firm ORMS {{as part of}} a major development in conjunction with the Crossrail construction work around Tottenham Court Road tube station and Centre Point. The proposed development includes <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> 800-seat subterranean performance venue. Numbers 1–6 and 17–21 Denmark Place, which run parallel along the back of the street, and the York and Clifton Mansions will be demolished, along with partial demolition of No. 21 Denmark Street.|$|E

50|$|As {{with all}} varieties, the {{category}} of semigroups with involution admits free objects. <b>The</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free semigroup (or monoid) with involution is based on that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free semigroup (and respectively that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free monoid). Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free group can easily be derived by refining <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free monoid with involution.|$|R
5|$|Lillehammer {{failed at}} its bid {{to host the}} 2012 Winter Youth Olympics, losing to Innsbruck, Austria, but was awarded the 2016 edition as the only bidder. The bid was based on reuse of the {{heritage}} and venues from the 1994 Olympics. Beyond <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Olympic Village, the only major upgrade to the venues is {{the addition of a}} curling rink in Kristins Hall.|$|E
5|$|London has 330km (205mi) {{of cycling}} paths {{throughout}} the city, 91km (59mi) {{of which have}} been added since 2005. In June 2016, London unveiled its first bike corrals, which replace parking for one vehicle with fourteen bicycle parking spaces, and fix-it stations, which provide cyclists with simple tools and a bicycle pump, throughout the city. In September 2016, city council approved a new 15 year cycling master plan that will see <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> additional 470km (292mi) of cycling paths added to the existing network.|$|E
5|$|Redfish and trout {{were once}} the main {{species of fish}} living in the lake, until <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{embankment}} reduced their populations. A large quantity of silt is now deposited in the lake from the Guadalupe River, after the dredging of a freshwater channel that supplies farmers and the Union Carbide plant in Seadrift. The channel has negatively affected the delta ecosystem by diminishing the river's nutritional input.|$|E
30|$|Key to the {{distinction}} between <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MSPF and <b>the</b> GMSF, children’s simultaneous coordination of units was documented as a developmental prerequisite for <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> GMSF; however, simultaneous coordination of units was {{not found to be}} a developmental prerequisite for <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MSPF. Although <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MSPF was found to be positively related with the simultaneous coordination of three levels of units, several students were documented to have constructed a MSPF without simultaneously coordinating three levels of units. However, no students were found to have constructed a GMSF without first being able to simultaneously coordinate three levels of units. This finding is consistent with the proposed learning progression, in that some children who are only able to coordinate a three-level structure sequentially as two two-level structures can still solve tasks like that presented in Fig.  4 (a task designed to indicate <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MSPF). However, this sequential coordination of units is not sufficient for <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> GMSF, which is required for tasks like the one presented in Fig.  5.|$|R

Espejo tried to convince people {{of the dangers of}} smallpox. He understood the current European medical theories about contagious diseases and warned against the incorrect belief that smallpox was transmitted by polluted air.

5|$|The first {{historian}} to make {{an academic}} estimate of the death toll of the Nanking Massacre was Tomio Hora in his 1967 book Kindai Senshi no Nazo ("Riddles of Modern War History"), who argued in favor of 200,000. Since then the death toll of the massacre {{has been a major}} topic of discussion among historians across the world. However, emotional arguments and political interference in the debate have tended to hinder <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> academic consensus on the number of people killed in the atrocity.|$|E
5|$|The largest plant task {{undertaken}} {{during the}} deployment was <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> airstrip at Opuwo. The squadron commander, Major David Crago, described how the road network in Namibia {{was better than}} expected; in retrospect, the squadron brought too much heavy road-making equipment. The squadron deployed 20 members of the Plant Troop (under Captain Nigel Catchlove) to Opuwo. Over a period of four months, Sergeant Ken Roma constructed an all-weather airstrip {{in one of the}} most remote parts of Namibia.|$|E
50|$|In July 1903, the BAGSR {{announced}} <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new building, {{which began}} in 1909.

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free {{restriction}} category can {{be broken}} into two steps: <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free stable semilattice fibration followed by <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free restriction category for this fibration. Restriction categories produced from such fibrations are “unitary”, in a sense which generalizes that from the theory of inverse semigroups. Characterization theorems for unitary restriction categories are derived. The paper ends with <b>an</b> explicit description <b>of</b> the free restriction category on a directed graph. 1...|$|R

5|$|As Osijek grew as a city, the fort's {{presence}} hindered {{the potential}} for urban development. The demolition {{of most of the}} fort walls happened between 1923 and 1926, with <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electric tramway. The last gunpowder magazine, located behind the church of St. Michael, was demolished in 1958. While most of the fortifications have been demolished (only the first and eighth bastions and the northern wall with its so-called 'water gate' were kept), the center of Tvrđa remains intact. The Yugoslav People's Army maintained a garrison and a military hospital in Tvrđa, but in the 1980s these buildings were gradually being abandoned, and adapted into ateliers for local painters and sculptors.|$|E
5|$|At {{the onset}} of the 2008 campaign, Hunter had served in Congress since 1981; {{representing}} California's 42nd (1981–83), 45th (1983-93), and 52nd (since 1993) congressional districts. During his tenure, he boasted a 92% lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union (ACU). Some of his successes included the passage of legislation leading to the construction of the 14-mile double-fence from the Pacific Ocean to Otay Mesa along the U.S.-Mexico border. He also helped pass the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which provided for <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> additional 670 miles of fence. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Hunter pushed for increased military spending and advancements in military technology. He became chairman of the committee in 2003 and remained in the position until the Democratic Party won the majority of the House in the 2006 mid-term election.|$|E

5|$|Between 1925 and 1928, Ny-Ålesund saw four air {{expeditions to}} the North Pole, {{two of which}} {{required}} <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> airship hangar and mast. The first proposal for an airport in Ny-Ålesund was launched in 1956 by Norsk Polar Navigasjon, who proposed an airport at Kvadehuksletta. Soviet protests against the airport caused the Norwegian authorities to oppose the plans, which were laid {{to rest in the}} early 1960s. Construction at Hamnerabben started in 1965 following the decision to build Kongsfjord Telemetry Station. The airport first hosted service to temporary landing strips near Longyearbyen, but from 1975 served Svalbard Airport. Lufttransport started flights with helicopters in the 1980s, but from 1989 has flown with fixed-wing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Bores {{are present}} on about 130 {{days in the}} year, {{concentrated}} on the days immediately following the new and full moon. The size and precise timing of the bore depend on {{such things as the}} time of high tide, the barometric pressure, the wind speed and direction, the amount of water coming down the river and how well scoured the main drainage channels are. There are a number of viewpoints from which the bore can be seen, or viewers can walk along the river bank or floodbanks. Historically, the bore has been of importance to shipping visiting the docks at Gloucester, but this was alleviated by <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alternative route, the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which opened in 1827. Nowadays the bore is of more interest to surfers and canoeists who attempt to ride the waves.|$|E
5|$|Development around Sovereign Harbour Marina, Britain's largest {{composite}} marina, {{has created}} more than 3,000 new luxury homes {{over the past}} 10 years and future plans include <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> innovation mall for small businesses and start-ups. The Eastbourne business community is well connected and mutually supportive. The Chamber of Commerce is strong with around 600 members and holds many networking events to facilitate local B2B links. There are many business events for local entrepreneurs to promote their goods and services. Large revenues are generated through tourism and conference tourism with reports showing a £365 million revenue from visitors in 2010, 3.1% greater than 2009 and estimated to support 7,160 jobs. The council's blueprint for future development in the town centre maps out a strategy for further boosting these numbers by attracting even more residents, shoppers and visitors to the town.|$|E

5|$|Henry VIII ordered <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{artillery}} blockhouse at East Tilbury in 1539–40 {{as part of}} a major {{scheme to}} fortify the coastline of England and Wales. It followed his break from the Pope and the Catholic Church, which led to fears that the Catholic powers of Europe would seek to invade so as to reimpose Papal authority. Five blockhouses were built along the Thames between Gravesend and Higham – two on the north bank at Tilbury and East Tilbury and three on the south bank at Gravesend, Milton (near the present New Tavern Fort) and Higham.|$|E
5|$|In October 2011 {{city and}} state {{officials}} announced an agreement in which the UN {{would be allowed to}} build a long-sought new office tower adjacent to the existing campus on the current Robert Moses Playground, which would be relocated. In exchange, the United Nations would allow <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> esplanade along the East River that would complete the East River Greenway, a waterfront pedestrian and bicycle pathway. While host nation authorities have agreed to the provisions of the plan, it needs the approval of the United Nations in order to be implemented. The plan is similar in concept to an earlier proposal that had been announced in 2000 but did not move forward.|$|E
5|$|Recognising the {{increasing}} congestion in the City and its rapidly growing suburbs, Pearson published a pamphlet in 1845 calling for <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> underground railway through the Fleet valley to Farringdon. The proposed railway {{would have been}} an atmospheric railway with trains pushed through tunnels by compressed air. Although the proposal was ridiculed and came to nothing (and would almost certainly have failed if it had been built, due to the shortcomings of the technology proposed), Pearson continued to lobby for a variety of railway schemes throughout the 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
