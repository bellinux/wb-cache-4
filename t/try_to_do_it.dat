500|$|Bart, {{and other}} The Simpsons characters, have {{appeared}} in numerous television commercials for Nestlé's Butterfinger candy bars from 1990 to 2001, with the slogan [...] "Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger!" [...] Lisa would occasionally advertise it too. Matt Groening would later say that the Butterfinger advertising campaign was {{a large part of}} the reason why Fox decided to pick up the half-hour show. The campaign was discontinued in 2001, much to the disappointment of Cartwright. Bart has also appeared in commercials for Burger King and Ramada Inn. In 2001, Kellogg's launched a brand of cereal called [...] "Bart Simpson Peanut Butter Chocolate Crunch", which was available for a limited time. Before the half-hour series went on the air, Matt Groening pitched Bart as a spokesperson for Jell-O. He wanted Bart to sing [...] "J-E-L-L-O", then burp the letter O. His belief was that kids would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> the next day, but he was rejected.|$|E
500|$|... "Quick Sand" [...] is a {{shuffling}} rock {{song that}} addresses the plight of illegal immigrants to Arizona. It depicts six migrants travelling through extreme climates in the Sonoran Desert to reach Devil's Highway {{in an attempt to}} cross the Mexico – United States border. They journey from Tamaulipas and through the mountains along Devil's Highway. Partway into the journey, the migrants are abandoned by their coyote guide and subsequently lose one another one by one. They experience thirst, hunger, injury, and fear, culminating with the only two surviving migrants being turned away by a vigilante at the border. Cooder said of the route's background and the narrative in an interview, [...] "t's been a migrant trail for 200 years. People go out there and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> on foot, but if you make one mistake and go five minutes out of your way, you become disorientated and dehydrated. And they find these mummified bodies out there. The heat has just baked them through. And the people who live through it often refer to having a vision of the Virgin of Guadalupe flying overhead. This is a very common vision when the dehydration sets in." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{executive}} producer Jeffrey Bell explained how the season would interact with Agent Carter saying, [...] "Agent Carter {{seems to be}} about SSR pre-S.H.I.E.L.D., but about the beginnings of something, and the basic values of that. S.H.I.E.L.D. got blown up last year and what Coulson always wanted was a return to basics, and it gives {{us an opportunity to}} return to some of those core values and even physically, some of that SSR stuff has a way of finding its way into our show that could be cool. Anyway we can tie things together, we’re going to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> but it is hard when the stories are 60 years apart." [...] Ultimately, the opening scene of [...] "Shadows" [...] serves as an introduction to the world of Agent Carter with the inclusion of Atwell as Carter, setting up characters and ideas for that series, including the then unconfirmed involvement of Howard Stark, who is mentioned in the scene, as well as Carter's belief in the need for [...] "a permanent unit during peacetime", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

Maybe in podcast form <b>it</b> is, and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> as a documentary story is really, really hard. But <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> as a serial, this {{is as old as}} Dickens." ...|$|R
500|$|Film writer Paul Simpson notes {{how closely}} Steiger {{prepared}} for his roles, {{and how he}} [...] "effortlessly" [...] recreated the mannerisms of figures such as Mussolini, in a [...] "compelling take on an enigmatic figure". Judith Crist of New York Magazine, reviewing Duck, You Sucker!, commented that Steiger was [...] "totally without mannerisms, always with manner", and noted that his [...] "silences are stunningly effective". Roger Ebert later echoed this statement, concurring that Steiger lacked mannerisms, writing, [...] "When he gets a character worth playing with, he creates it new from the bottom up, out of whole cloth. I don't know how he does it. It's {{almost as if he}} gets inside the skin of the guy he's playing and starts being that person for a while". Steiger said: [...] "I always tried to do things different. If I got a role which was similar to another I'd <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> a little different." [...] His explosive screen performances were an influence on many later actors, including Robert De Niro, who used Steiger's portrayal of Al Capone as a reference for his own performance in The Untouchables (1987). Elvis Presley was highly impressed with Steiger's [...] "powerful and wrenching performance" [...] in The Pawnbroker.|$|E
500|$|Talking on how {{the season}} would {{interact}} with Agent Carter, Bell said, [...] "Here's what I think is interesting. Agent Carter seems to be about S.S.R. pre-S.H.I.E.L.D., but about the beginnings of something, and the basic values of that. S.H.I.E.L.D. got blown up last year and what Coulson always wanted was a return to basics, and it gives {{us an opportunity to}} return to some of those core values and even physically, some of that S.S.R. stuff has a way of finding its way into our show that could be cool. Anyway we can tie things together, we're going to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> but it is hard when the stories are 60 years apart." [...] Several scenes in [...] "Shadows" [...] and [...] "The Things We Bury" [...] are flashbacks featuring Peggy Carter which serve as an introduction to the world of Agent Carter, setting up characters and ideas for that series, including Carter's belief in the need for [...] "a permanent unit during peacetime", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D. The episode [...] "Making Friends and Influencing People" [...] names Hydra's ability to brainwash people as the Faustus Method, named for the character who appears, as Johann Fennhoff, in Agent Carter, played by Ralph Brown.|$|E

2500|$|Bourdieu {{also played}} a crucial role in the popularisation of {{correspondence}} analysis and particularly multiple correspondence analysis. Bourdieu held that these geometric techniques of data analysis are, like his sociology, inherently relational. [...] "I use Correspondence Analysis very much, because I think that it is essentially a relational procedure whose philosophy fully expresses what in my view constitutes social reality. It is a procedure that 'thinks' in relations, as I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with the concept of field," [...] Bourdieu said, in the preface to The Craft of Sociology.|$|E
2500|$|Palin {{has been}} a member of Feminists for Life since 2006. In August 2006, she told the Anchorage Daily News that [...] "no woman should have to choose between her career, {{education}} and her child." [...] In an interview with Katie Couric on September 30, 2008, Palin said, [...] "I'm a feminist who believes in equal rights and I believe that women certainly today have every opportunity that a man has to succeed, and to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all, anyway. And I'm very, very thankful that I've been brought up in a family where gender hasn't been an issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2009 interview, Khan {{stated that}} he tends to take an {{independent}} approach {{to the world of}} filmmaking, noting that he does not [...] "do different things; I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in a different manner. I think every person should follow his/her dream and try and make it possible to create an ability to achieve it backed by its practicality." [...] He has also indicated that he is more interested in the process of filmmaking than in the end result: [...] "For me, the process is more important, more joyful. I would like to have my entire concentration on the process right from the first step." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ledley {{was played}} in an {{unfamiliar}} role at left-back during his first month at Celtic, a position he had only previously played in once or twice. [...] Despite playing {{in an unfamiliar}} position, he concentrated on establishing himself in his new team, stating [...] "...if I am told {{to do a job}} for my team, I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> {{to the best of my}} ability", and he scored his first goal for Celtic against St Mirren in a 4–0 home victory in the SPL on 22 August 2010.

2500|$|Similar to the band's {{previous}} album releases, numerous collaborators {{appear on}} Walking Under Stars. Lambert explained on 5 August that [...] "we [...] <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> {{in the same}} room" [...] when guest artists record and, for the seventh studio album, the band worked with Sabre, New Zealand soul singer Aaradhna, Brother Ali, Dan Sultan, Drapht, Canadian voice-over artist Dave Pettitt and One Above, the Adelaide producer who also worked on Drinking from the Sun. Lambert explained to TheMusic.com.au website that Sultan is a [...] "gifted" [...] artist who the band loves [...] "as a person as well", and [...] "it was really good to work with [...] Ali, who’s an artist that we admire so much." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1908 Homer {{suffered}} temporary {{impairment of}} his speech and muscular control as {{the effects of a}} mild stroke; on June 4 he wrote his brother Charles that [...] "I can paint as well as ever. I think my pictures better for having one eye in the pot and one eye up a chimney— a new departure in the art world." [...] By July 18 he was able to write that he had regained his abilities with the exception of tying [...] "my neck tie in the way that I have done for the past 20 years....Every four or five days I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> but....it has been of no use." [...] Although he never completely recovered, Homer was well enough to attempt a major work, and it is probably Right and Left that he referred to {{in a letter to his}} brother Charles dated December 8, 1908: [...] "I am painting when it is light enough on a most surprising picture".|$|E

2500|$|Le Guin's {{feelings}} towards anarchism {{are closely}} tied to her Taoist beliefs and both ideas appear in her work. [...] "Taoism and Anarchism fit together in some very interesting ways and I've been a Taoist ever since I learned what it was." [...] She has participated in numerous peace marches and although she does not call herself an anarchist since she does not live the lifestyle, she does feel that [...] "Democracy is good but it isn't {{the only way to}} achieve justice and a fair share." [...] Le Guin has said: [...] "The Dispossessed is an Anarchist utopian novel. Its ideas come from the Pacifist Anarchist tradition – Kropotkin etc. So did some of the ideas of the so-called counterculture of the sixties and seventies." [...] She has also said that anarchism [...] "is a necessary ideal at the very least. It is an ideal without which we couldn't go on. If you are asking me is anarchism at this point a practical movement, well, then you get in the question of where you <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and who's living on your boundary?" ...|$|E
