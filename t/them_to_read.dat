The prosecutor, Attorney General Sir Thomas Inskip, {{solicited}} testimony from biological and medical experts and from the writer Rudyard Kipling. But when Kipling appeared {{on the morning of}} the trial, Inskip told him he would not be needed. James Melville had wired the defence witnesses the night before to tell them not to come in. The panel of twelve magistrates who heard the appeal had to rely on passages Inskip read to them for knowledge of the book, since the Director of Public Prosecutions had refused to release copies for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> After deliberating for only five minutes, they upheld Biron's decision.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of its development, the Sharingan will grant the user three unique abilities: The first being its famous ability for the user to {{instantly}} memorize and replicate any opponent's movement and attacks with perfect accuracy. The Sharingan's second ability grants the user increased ocular perception, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and predict the movements and actions of fast-moving objects. This also allows the user to easily recognize genjutsu and different forms of chakra (i.e.: to visualize chakra in different colors). Its final ability is a brand of scenarios that suggests actions and thoughts to the opponent, acting as {{an effective way to}} produce beyond genjutsu abilities or implant memories in another person.|$|E
5|$|Saunders {{attended}} the local mission school at Lake Condah, {{where he did}} well in maths, geometry and languages. His father, meanwhile, taught Reg and Harry about the bush, and encouraged <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> Shakespeare and Australian literature. After completing eight years of schooling, Saunders earned his merit certificate. His formal education thus ended, {{he went to work}} at the age of 14 as a millhand in a sawmill. Employers regularly withheld payments for Aboriginal labourers at this time, but Saunders refused to work unless he was paid his full entitlement, and his employer relented. He worked and furthered his education until 1937, when he went into business with his father and brother, operating a sawmill in Portland, Victoria; the sawmill was destroyed in a bushfire in 1939.|$|E
5|$|After her coronation, Anne {{settled into}} a quiet routine at the King's {{favourite}} residence, Greenwich Palace, {{to prepare for the}} birth of her baby. The child was born slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533. Between three and four in the afternoon, Anne gave birth to a girl, who was christened Elizabeth, probably in honour of either or both Anne's mother Elizabeth Howard and Henry's mother, Elizabeth of York. But the birth of a girl was a heavy blow to her parents, since they had confidently expected a boy. All but one of the royal physicians and astrologers had predicted a son for them and the French king had already been asked to stand as his godfather. Now the prepared letters announcing the birth of a prince had an s hastily added to <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> princes and the traditional jousting tournament for the birth of an heir was cancelled.|$|E

50|$|The lower school {{curriculum}} includes formal instruction in grammar and composition, phonics and spelling, and reading comprehension. The earlier years are largely foundational: {{students are taught}} to think about language as a logical, hierarchical progression. In later years, students sharpen these skills and apply <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> literature, both secular and sacred, and writing short essays. In addition to language, students also receive instruction in arithmetic and mathematical reasoning throughout their entire course of study.|$|R

5|$|Inspired by Robert Raikes, Trimmer {{also became}} {{active in the}} Sunday school movement, {{founding}} the first Sunday school for poor children in Old Brentford in 1786. She {{and two of the}} ministers in her parish, Charles Sturgess and Charles Coates, organized a fund drive and established several schools for the poor children of the neighborhood. Initially, five hundred boys and girls wanted to attend Trimmer's Sunday school; unable to accommodate such numbers, she decided to exclude those under five years of age and restricted each family to one pupil. The parish set up three schools, each with about thirty students—one for older boys, one for younger boys and one for girls. While some other educational reformers of the period such as Mary Wollstonecraft argued for co-educational instruction, Trimmer was opposed to such pedagogical changes; she believed in educating the sexes separately. The students were taught to read, with the aim of teaching <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the Bible. The students were also encouraged to keep clean—"a present of a brush and comb was given to all who desired them". Trimmer's schools became so well known and admired that Raikes, Trimmer's initial inspiration, recommended those who needed assistance organizing a Sunday school to turn to Trimmer; even Queen Charlotte asked Trimmer's advice on founding a Sunday school at Windsor.|$|E

Vietnamese abandoned {{their use in}} the early 20th century in favour of a Latin-based script, and Korean in the late 20th century in favour of its homegrown hangul script, although as Korean switched much more recently, many Koreans still learn <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> texts written before then, {{or in some cases}} to disambiguate homophones.|$|E
25|$|Happy Feet {{was also}} {{partially}} inspired by earlier documentaries {{such as the}} BBC's Life in the Freezer. In 2001, during an otherwise non-sequitur meeting, Doug Mitchell impulsively presented Warner Bros., studio president Alan Horn with an early rough draft of the film's screenplay, and asked <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> it while he and Miller flew back to Australia. By the time they'd landed, Warner had decided to provide funding on the film.

25|$|The {{education}} of boys began {{in their own}} home up until the age of seven when they had to attend school. There, they had several teachers who taught <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write, as well as subjects such as mathematics and music. Boys also had to take part in physical education classes where they were prepared for future military service with activities such as wrestling, racing, jumping and gymnastics. At eighteen they served in the army and were instructed on how to bear arms. Physical education was very intense and many of the boys ended up becoming true athletes. In addition to these compulsory lessons, the students had the chance to discuss and learn from the great philosophers, grammarians and orators of the time. Some poor people had to stay at home and help their parents. However Aristophanes and Socrates, though they were poor, became famous and successful.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} her B.A. {{degree from}} Bryn Mawr in 1963, Oughton {{spent the next}} two years in Guatemala with the American Friends Service Committee program (AFSC). Nearly half the women from Oughton's college senior class had gone on to graduate school. Oughton was assigned to Chichicastenango, at that time an isolated Indian market town. Oughton went to Guatemala as a liberal, believing that the problems could be identified and solutions devised and carried out. Eventually, she became a radical, and began to feel an urgency to change everything at once. While there, Oughton worked with young adults and older indigenous people to teach <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> She helped local Catholic priests implement nutritional programs and edited a left-wing Guatemalan newspaper. Oughton lived in a small house with a dirt floor and a little outhouse. During this time, the questions with which she had struggled with came to a head. Oughton questioned what to do about poverty, social injustice, and revolution in the world. Oughton {{came to the conclusion that}} no matter how many hours were spent working to feed and educate, there would always be more people than jobs to earn wages, inadequate food supplies, and never enough shelter to protect people from the elements.|$|E

[...] The script was purchased from first-time screenwriter Arndt for $250,000 by Marc Turtletaub, one of the film's producers, on December 21, 2001. Yerxa and Berger remained as producers as they were responsible for finding the directors and cinematographer, assisting in the ending re-shoot, and helping bring the film to the Sundance Film Festival.|$|E

500|$|Ellen Wilkinson {{was born}} on 8 October 1891, at 41 Coral Street in the Manchester {{district}} of Chorlton-on-Medlock. She was the third child and second daughter of Richard Wilkinson, a cotton worker who became an insurance agent, and his wife, Ellen, née Wood. Richard Wilkinson was a pillar of his local Wesleyan Methodist church, and combined {{a strong sense of}} social justice with forthright views on self-help; rather than espousing working-class solidarity his view, according to Ellen, was: [...] "I have pulled myself out of the gutter, why can't they?" [...] Entirely self-educated, he ensured that his children received the best schooling available, encouraged <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> widely, and inculcated strong Christian principles.|$|E

40|$|Introduction It {{has been}} for many years a dream of {{dyslexia}} researchers to devise a screening test which allowed one to pick out those children likely to have problems before they start learning (and failing) <b>to</b> <b>read</b> (eg. de Hirsch, Jansky and Langford, 1966; Bender, 1970). Such early information should allow the prophylactic support of reading acquisition in the `at risk' children, thus allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>to</b> <b>read</b> {{at the same rate}} as their peers, and avoiding the vicious circle of failure, negative expectations, possible disruptive behaviour, reading avoidance, and continuing failure which besets people suffering early setbacks (Holt, 1970; Stanovich, 1986). There seems little doubt that the approach is fundamentally sound, in that studies which have identified `at risk' children early have been able <b>to</b> help <b>them</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> and subsequent problems have rarely developed (Lundberg et al, 1980; Bradley, 1988; Clay, 1991).

500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the publication of The Fountainhead, Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom the book profoundly influenced. In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated [...] "The Collective") included future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later Nathaniel Branden) and his wife Barbara, and Barbara's cousin Leonard Peikoff. At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. Later she began allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the drafts of her new novel, Atlas Shrugged, as the manuscript pages were written. In 1954 Rand's {{close relationship with the}} younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.|$|E

[...] "I think he just wanted {{each of us to}} look at the stars a little differently," [...] said John Cho. After the shoot, Abrams cut out some scenes of Kirk and Spock as children, including seeing the latter as a baby, as well as a subplot involving Nero being imprisoned by the Klingons and his escape: this explanation for his absence during Kirk's life confused many to whom Abrams screened the film. Other scenes cut out explained that the teenage Kirk stole his stepfather's antique car because he had forced him to clean it before an auction; and that the Orion he seduced at the Academy worked in the operations division. Afterwards, she agrees to open the e-mail containing his patch that allows him to pass the Kobayashi Maru test.|$|E
500|$|After {{her visit}} to the queen, Trimmer was {{inspired}} to write The Œconomy of Charity, which describes how readers, specifically women, can establish Sunday schools in their own communities. However, her book accomplished much more than this. While proponents of Sunday schools such as Raikes and Trimmer claimed that the schools would help control the growing social unrest of the poor, critics claimed that these schools would only encourage the social upheaval {{they were trying to}} quell. The Hon. John Byng, for example, issued the dire warning that [...] "not only would education 'teach <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> seditious pamphlets, books and publications against Christianity'… but it would render them unfit for 'the laborious employment to which their rank in society had destined them'". Trimmer agreed that the poor were [...] "destined" [...] by God to be poor but would argue that her schools reinforced that divine social hierarchy. The Sunday school debate was waged in churches, in Parliament and in print; in publishing The Œconomy of Charity, Trimmer was entering this vigorous debate.|$|E
