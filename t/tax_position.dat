25|$|In 1927, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} that case that {{illegally}} earned income was subject to income tax; Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. rejected {{the argument that the}} Fifth Amendment protected criminals from reporting illegal income. The IRS special investigation unit chose Frank J. Wilson to investigate Capone, with the focus on his spending. The key to Capone's conviction on tax charges was proving his income, and the most valuable evidence in that regard originated in his offer to pay tax. Ralph, his brother and a gangster in his own right, was tried for tax evasion in 1930. Ralph spent the next three years in prison after being convicted in a two-week trial over which Wilkerson presided. Capone ordered his lawyer to regularize his <b>tax</b> <b>position.</b> Crucially, during the ultimately abortive negotiations that followed, his lawyer stated the income that Capone was willing to pay tax on for various years, admitting income of $100,000 for 1928 and 1929, for instance. Hence, without any investigation, the government had been given a letter from a lawyer acting for Capone conceding his large taxable income for certain years. In 1931, Capone was charged with income tax evasion, as well as with various violations of the Volstead Act (Prohibition) at the Chicago Federal Building in the courtroom of Judge James Herbert Wilkerson. U. S. Attorney George E. Q. Johnson agreed to a deal that he hoped might result in the judge giving Capone a couple of years, but Judge Wilkerson had been aware of the deal all along and refused to allow Capone to plead guilty for a reduced sentence. On {{the second day of the}} trial, Judge Wilkerson overruled objections that a lawyer could not confess for his client, saying that anyone making a statement to the government did so at his own risk. Wilkerson deemed that the 1930 letter to federal authorities could be admitted into evidence from a lawyer acting for Capone.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} tax aggressiveness. I utilize the unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) disclosed by the adoption of Financial Interpretation No. 48, ?Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes? (FIN 48) to proxy for firms? tax aggressiveness. I hand collect UTB disclosures for 562 calendar year-end firms in the S and P 1500. Controlling for firms? incentives and abilities to engage in aggressive <b>tax</b> <b>positions</b> (<b>tax</b> factors) and firms? discretion over recognizing the financial reporting benefits of aggressive <b>tax</b> <b>positions,</b> I examine whether firms? level of aggressive <b>tax</b> <b>positions</b> is influenced by (1) financial reporting aggressiveness, (2) choice of auditor, (3) analyst coverage, and (4) corporate governance quality. Using ordinary least squares regression, I examine the determinants of firms total UTB and its permanent and temporary components. I find that UTB and its permanent component are positively associated with firm size, presence of foreign operations, research and development activity, selling, general and administrative activity, firm value, and {{the probability that the}} firm engages in tax shelter activity. However, the temporary component is only increasing in firm size. Also, I find that UTB and its permanent component are positively associated with firms engaging in financial reporting aggressiveness and increasing auditor provided tax services, but negatively associated with analyst coverage, while the temporary component is only positively associated with financial reporting aggressiveness. Finally, I split the sample based on firms? use of discretion over recognizing the tax benefits of aggressive <b>tax</b> <b>positions</b> prior to FIN 48 adoption. I find that firms which aggressively recognize tax benefits prior to FIN 48 adoption (i. e. firms that increased UTBs at FIN 48 adoption) have UTBs that are positive and significantly associated with (1) the probability that a firm engages in tax shelter activity, (2) auditor provided tax services, and (3) their record of using last chance earnings management to meet or beat analyst forecasts. These associations are not significant for firms that did not aggressively recognize tax benefits prior to FIN 48 adoption, suggesting that firms? financial reporting aggressiveness is positively associated with firms? level of tax aggression...|$|R
