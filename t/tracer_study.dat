We have implemented probabilistic tractography in data acquired in a macaque model and compared this with connection information in a database of invasive <b>tracer</b> <b>studies</b> in the same model. The nature of the corticocortical interconnection information gained from probabilistic tractography is different to that gained from invasive studies, the latter also being sparse.

40|$|Abstract-A {{two-dimensional}} nonlinear {{numerical model}} {{is used to}} study {{the extension of the}} critical dividing streamline hypothesis to larger scale terrain than considered in most previous observational studies. Upstream blocking in the absence of thermal forcing is found to be reasonably well described for air quality assessment purposes by the critical dividing streamline hypothesis. The effect of rotation (i. e. the Coriolis force) is to decrease the extent of blocking in marginal cases. Influence of the Coriolis force is expected to increase as the length scale of the topography increases. It is also found that thermally induced nocturnal slope winds may compromise the dividing streamline hypothesis {{as a result of their}} entrainment mass flux. We suggest hat slope flows have not played a substantial role in previous <b>tracer</b> <b>studies</b> over small-scale terrain due to the dependence of slope flows on length scale and ambient thermal stratification. <b>Tracer</b> <b>studies</b> around mesoscale terrain would help to clarify the importance of rotational and diabatic effects.

40|$|Using passively {{administered}} isotope-labeled anti-KLH {{to suppress}} the antibody response of rabbits to KLH, we have attempted to estimate the amount of antigen actually involved in stimulating antibody formation. Single and paired label <b>tracer</b> <b>studies</b> of passively administered anti-KLH IgG indicated that from 0. 7 to 2. 9 µg were utilized or involved by the antigen {{in the course of}} a 90 % suppression of the response to 2 mg KLH. <b>Tracer</b> <b>studies</b> of labeled anti-KLH F(ab') 2 fragments revealed the retention of from 2 to 3 µg of these fragments in the entire rabbit during a 60 % suppression of the response to 1 mg KLH. Based on previously determined ratios of mixtures of KLH and suppressive amounts of anti-KLH in adjuvant, the antibody utilization data were converted to the probable amount of antigen or immunogen involved. It appears that after an injection of 2 mg of KLH approximately 0. 2 – 0. 5 µg of antigen persisted and reacted with antibody given 24 hr later. Since all of this persisting, reactive antigen may not be immunogenic, the above estimate of immunogen is probably high, but may serve to establish upper limits for the amounts of immunogen involved in stimulating antibody formation and provide a meaningful frame of reference for antigen <b>tracer</b> <b>studies...</b>|$|R

Advisors:Dr. Deanne Magnusson & Dr. Gerald Fry. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 118 pages, appendix A-B. The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the impact on undergraduate college admissions decisions at selective U. S. colleges and universities of student enrolment in the Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) programs of international schools. A total of 30 interviews were conducted by the researcher with admissions personnel from selective colleges and universities in the United States. Additionally, two <b>tracer</b> <b>studies</b> were conducted from two similar international schools; one offering the IB Diploma program and the other offering the AP program. The <b>tracer</b> <b>studies</b> focused on AP/IB enrolment and its impact on college admissions success. Results of the study indicate that there is a strong correlation between enrolment in these programs and admission to selective undergraduate institutions (high correlations of r = -. 77 and r = -. 75 were found in both <b>tracer</b> <b>studies).</b> However, this correlation is influenced by specific secondary school leader commitments to these programs. It is not essential for secondary school students to be enrolled in these programs in order to gain admission to the most selective colleges and universities in the United States since AP and IB enrolment explains roughly 58 % of the variance in admissions. Other important factors explain 42 % of the variance. These factors were not identified in this study. These results have significant implications for both secondary schools, institutions of higher education, the IBO and College Board. The data from the two <b>tracer</b> <b>studies</b> and the interviews with admissions personnel indicate that participation in these programs enhance admissions chances, but admission is possible without such participation...|$|R
