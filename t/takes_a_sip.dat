5|$|In the video, Selena {{is sitting}} in a {{restaurant}} where a mariachi band is performing. A waiter offers her a glass of water.

Selena <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> of water before she leaves the restaurant, crying.|$|E
5|$|The video cuts {{between two}} narratives. In the first, a hunter (uncredited actor) straps a 16-gauge shotgun around his shoulder, and tracks {{footsteps}} through the snow, eventually finding the Swamplord (the band's mascot, here as depicted {{on the covers}} of The Black Waltz and For the Revolution). In the second narrative, the band members, dressed warmly in heavy clothing, are sitting around a campfire, preparing a kettle of an unknown drink. As each person <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip,</b> they begin convulsing. To simulate the drink's effects, the camera used shaking and rapid zooming. As the song finishes, Pekka pours himself a drink and is the only one immune to its effects.|$|E
500|$|When {{the trio}} arrives at Duff Gardens, Bart and Lisa wear Selma out, {{especially}} when they go on the Little Land of Duff ride and Bart dares Lisa to drink the toxic [...] "water". Lisa is confused, but Bart mocks her until Selma intervenes, shouting at Bart to shut up and ordering Lisa to drink the water. When Lisa <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip,</b> she hallucinates, grows violent and paranoid, and wanders away from the ride, tripping out to the parade music. While Selma is looking for Lisa, Bart gets on a roller coaster called The Barrel Roll and ends up having to be rescued after the car stops {{in the center of}} one of the inversions. Lisa is soon found swimming nude in the Fermentarium, returned to Selma and given pills by an unlicensed doctor.|$|E

5000|$|Tom khlong is a {{traditional}} Thai dish similar to tom yum except that it uses herbs which have been dried or roasted. There is an alternative name that ancient Thai people had for tom khlong called tom hok ue (ต้มโฮกอือ, Hok ue is the sound that people make when <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip)</b> because the moment you <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> it will produce a refreshing feeling.|$|R
2500|$|The {{advertisement}} {{begins with}} {{three young men}} standing outside a fruit shop or cornershop. One of them <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> out of a can of Tango he is holding. The voice-over of [...] "commentators" [...] Ralph and Tony (voiced by Hugh Dennis and Ray Wilkins) appear. Ralph says [...] "oh, I think we could use a video replay here" [...] and the footage of the man drinking the Tango is [...] "rewound" [...] (with the visual effect of a tape recorded being rewound on screen) to some ten seconds before he drinks the Tango, for a [...] "replay". Then, a man painted completely orange (Peter Geeves) comes onto the scene, who runs around the men and then taps the Tango drinker on the back.|$|E
2500|$|Their UK {{commercial}} [...] "noitulovE", first {{broadcast in}} October 2005, was the most-awarded commercial worldwide in 2006. In it, three men drink {{a pint of}} Guinness, then begin to both walk and evolve backward. Their [...] "reverse evolution" [...] passes through an ancient Homo sapiens, a monkey, a flying lemur, a pangolin, an ichthyosaur, and a velociraptor, until finally settling on a mud skipper drinking dirty water, which then expresses its disgust at {{the taste of the}} stuff, followed by the line: [...] "Good Things Come To Those Who Wait". This was later modified to have a different endings to advertise Guinness Extra Cold, often shown as [...] "break bumpers" [...] {{at the beginning and end}} of commercial breaks. The second endings show either the Homo sapiens being suddenly frozen in a block of ice, the ichthyasaurs being frozen while swimming, or the pool of muddy water freezing over as the mud skipper <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip,</b> freezing his tongue to the surface.|$|E

50|$|None, but the Deacon is a {{mountain}} of a man whose strength is easily {{greater than that of}} a normal man considering he can lift an average sized man with one arm and choke the life out of him at the same time. If the Deacon <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> from the Elixir from the Rock of Etam, he will gain superhuman strength. He is also immune to the Penance Stare of Ghost Rider because he is not bothered by anything he has done. The Deacon truly feels as if he is doing the Lord's work by punishing the sinners of the world. Deacon is a formidable armed and unarmed combatant.|$|E
5000|$|A {{group of}} people are {{clustered}} around a table for a typical lunch that will include several courses and a clear, fiery drink.

The liquid is aquavit. The ritual is virtually the same throughout Scandinavia.|$|E
