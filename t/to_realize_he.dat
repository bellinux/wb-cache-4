In the eighth grade, he noticed several high school cross country team members jog to practice past the football field, an activity he then viewed as mundane.

500|$|In {{the first}} months after the April 1978 revolution, Hafizullah Amin and Taraki had a very close relationship. Taraki {{reportedly}} remarked, [...] "Amin and I are like nail and flesh, not separable". Amin set about constructing a personality cult centered on Taraki. In party and government meetings Amin always referred to Taraki as [...] "The Great Leader", [...] "The Star of the East" [...] or [...] "The Great Thinker" [...] among other titles, while Amin was given such titles as [...] "The True Disciple and Student". Amin would later come <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>he</b> had created a monster when the Kim Il-sung-like personality cult he had created inspired Taraki to become overly confident and believe in his own brilliance. Taraki began discounting Amin's suggestions, fostering in Amin {{a deep sense of}} resentment.

500|$|Suganami {{was deeply}} {{invested}} in Alien Soldier and devoted {{a lot of}} personal time to developing it. He began developing the game himself as the sole designer and programmer. At the time, Mega Drive games typically required two designers and two programmers, but Suganami wanted to challenge himself and see if it was possible to create the game himself. He originally had ambitious plans for a large backstory, but in order to make their deadline of 3 January 1995, the majority of it was cut from the game. As the deadline approached, he came <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>he</b> {{would not be able to}} complete Alien Soldier himself, and so additional staff were added to provide him support. He worked overtime during the New Years holidays in order to complete the game while the market for the Mega Drive was quickly shrinking. Only about half of the team's original ideas were completed in time for release. They originally planned to create 100 bosses, but this was cut much shorter due to the time constraints. One of the bosses that was included, [...] "Seven Force", was originally featured in Gunstar Heroes.|$|E

Orrec also develops a bond with Coaly, a guide dog trained for him by Gry. On her deathbed, Melle asks to see Orrec's eyes one last time, so he removes his blindfold, and realizes that his love for Melle would never have let him hurt her. Orrec begins to secretly remove his blindfold to read his books, and once looks at Coaly accidentally without hurting her. He realizes that he never had the gift of unmaking; his father had performed all of the acts attributed to him, and had pretended that Orrec had a [...] "wild" [...] gift to frighten people into leaving his domain alone. He confronts his father, and stops wearing a blindfold. Soon after, Ogge leads a raid against Roddmant. Canoc kills Ogge and his son while defending it, thus avenging his wife, and is killed himself. Orrec and Gry decide that there is no future for them in the uplands, because Gry is unwilling to use her gift to call animals to be hunted, and Orrec's gift of poetry is of no use there. They join Caspromant to Roddmant, and leave the uplands to make a new life elsewhere.|$|E

During the fourth season Don Draper starts <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>he</b> has a major drinking problem. ABC News quoted an addiction specialist who said that [...] "over the last ten years, alcoholism has been more fully understood as a disease.
