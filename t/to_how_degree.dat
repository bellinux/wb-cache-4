Genome elimination – whereby an individual discards chromosomes inherited from one parent, and transmits only those inherited from the other parent – is found across thousands of animal species. It {{is more common in}} association with inbreeding, under male heterogamety, in males, and in the form of paternal genome elimination. However, the reasons for this broad pattern remain unclear. We develop a mathematical model <b>to</b> determine <b>how</b> <b>degree</b> of inbreeding, sex determination, genomic location, pattern of gene expression and parental origin of the eliminated genome interact to determine the fate of genome-elimination alleles. We find that: inbreeding promotes paternal genome elimination in the heterogametic sex; this may incur population extinction under female heterogamety, owing to eradication of males; and extinction is averted under male heterogamety, owing to countervailing sex-ratio selection. Thus, we explain the observed pattern of genome elimination. Our results highlight the interaction between mating system, sex-ratio selection and intragenomic conflict.

30|$|The {{basic idea}} of the {{coverage}} adjustment scheme is to compare the number of estimated positions {{with the number of}} registered identifications within the coverage of an identification sensor. If the approximated radius of an identification sensor is accurate enough, the number of the estimated positions is mostly equivalent to the number of the registered identifications. Otherwise, it means that the approximated coverage differs from the actual coverage. The radius of an identification sensor is adjusted by checking the difference between them. In some cases, the system needs to check the farthest or closet estimated position from the center of an identification sensor. For example, when the number of the estimated positions is equivalent to the number of the registered identifications, the coverage of an identification should be adjust to the farthest estimated position. Then, the problem in the coverage adjustment scheme is <b>to</b> determine <b>how</b> <b>degree</b> the radius is adjusted by at each sampling time. Since the coverage of an identification sensor can vary temporally, the large change of the radius may cause a reverse effect and the association performance may degenerate. Thus, we use the average speed of tracked objects measured by the association system as the degree of the radius adjustment to be unsusceptible to the object dynamics.|$|R

40|$|After {{many years}} of inattention, policymakers are now focused on troubling {{statistics}} indicating that members of poor and minority groups {{are less likely than}} their higher-income counterparts to seek help when they experience a civil justice problem. Indeed, roughly three-quarters of the poor do not seek legal help when they experience a civil justice problem, and inaction is even more pronounced among poor blacks. Past work on access to civil justice largely relies on unconfirmed assumptions about the behavior patterns and needs of those experiencing civil justice problems. At a time when increased attention and resources are being devoted to questions of racial and socioeconomic access to civil justice, it is critical to understand the underlying causes of the disparities in justice utilization. This Article uses original, empirical data to provide novel explanations for these puzzling inaction statistics. The data reveal previously undetected connections that are crucial for creating effective access to justice policy.
