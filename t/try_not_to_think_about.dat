500|$|Garland, who has {{explored}} science fiction themes {{in some of}} his previous work, was a sounding board for ideas for the novel and an early reader of the book. Ishiguro stated that, despite Garland's screenwriting skills and previous experience with film, they did not discuss the idea of a film until after the novel was complete. [...] "I <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> things like that when writing a novel—in fact, quite the reverse", he stated. He said that he attempts to [...] "go for something... very interior, following thoughts and memories, something that I think is difficult to do on the screen, which is essentially a third-person medium." [...] Thus he was surprised when Garland, after reading a complete version of the book, {{said he would like to}} try to adapt it. Ishiguro recalled that Garland wrote a draft very quickly and immediately asked of his opinion of it [...] "as a first go". Ishiguro was very satisfied with Garland's screenplay—which was changed very little from its initial draft to the filmed version—and with the final film. When asked to compare the experience with that of The Remains of the Day, he acknowledged that both were more hands-on with this film. Romanek said that he did not make Never Let Me Go a science fiction film; rather, he was presenting a love story with fictional science context mixed in. He described the film as telling a [...] "love story where the science fiction is this subtle patina on the story." [...] The filmmaker explained that had they done the film with [...] "science fiction-y things", it would have been more openly, with props such as futuristic structures and devices.|$|E
2500|$|Ironic control theory, {{also known}} as [...] "ironic process theory", states that thought {{suppression}} [...] "leads to an increased occurrence of the suppressed content in waking states". The irony {{lies in the fact}} that although people <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> a particular subject, there is a high probability that it will appear in one's dreams regardless. There is a difference for individuals who have a higher tendency of suppression; they are more prone to psychopathological responses such as [...] "intrusive thoughts, including depression, anxiety and obsessional thinking". Due to these individuals having higher instances of thought suppression, they experience dream rebound more often.|$|E
2500|$|On March 16, 1998, a {{gathering}} of local people and former American and Vietnamese soldiers stood together at {{the place of the}} My Lai massacre in Vietnam to commemorate its 30th anniversary. American veterans Hugh Thompson and Lawrence Colburn, who were shielding civilians during the massacre, addressed the crowd. Among the listeners was Phan Thi Nhanh, a 14-year-old girl {{at the time of the}} massacre. She was saved by Thompson and vividly remembered that tragic day, [...] "We don't say we forget. We just <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the past, but in our hearts we keep a place to think about that". Colburn challenged Lieutenant Calley, [...] "...to face the women we faced today who asked the questions they asked, and look at the tears in their eyes and tell them why it happened". No American diplomats nor any other officials attended the meeting.|$|E

Adewunmi remarked that [...] "it comes to this: if the casting of Rue, Thresh and Cinna has left you bewildered and upset, consider two things. One: {{you may be a}} racist—congrats! Two: you definitely lack basic reading comprehension. Mazel tov!" [...] Erik Kain of Forbes saw the controversy as a way to appreciate the value of free speech. He states that while society may never be free of racism, [...] "racist comments made on Facebook and Twitter quickly become public record. Aggregations of these comments, like the Jezebel piece, expose people for what they are. Sure, many hide under the cloak of anonymity, but many others cannot or choose not to. And as the internet becomes more civilized and its denizens more accountable, this sort of thing carries more and more weight." [...] Amandla Stenberg responded to the controversy with the following statement: [...] "As a fan of the books, I feel fortunate to be part of The Hunger Games family... It was an amazing experience; I am proud of the film and my performance. I {{want to thank all of}} my fans and the entire Hunger Games community for their support and loyalty."

5000|$|Wegner {{and colleagues}} {{performed}} {{a series of}} experiments in which people tried to suppress thoughts, for example by attempting {{not to think of}} a white bear. That work revealed that attempting not to think of a topic often backfires, resulting in high rates of intrusive thoughts about the topic. Wegner coined the term [...] "ironic mental processes" [...] for this effect, which is also known more commonly as the [...] "white bear phenomenon". The effect contributes to various psychological challenges and disorders. Smokers who <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> cigarettes find it harder to give up. People who suppress thoughts that may cause an anxiety reaction often make those thoughts more intrusive. Wegner found that the ironic effect is stronger when people are stressed or depressed.|$|E

[...] During his teenage years, he traveled between his divorced parents' houses and seldom played, for he lacked consistent access to both computer and Internet connection. As a result, he progressed slowly his first four years, playing a mere two to six weeks out of each, and since he could practice online only while living with his father, Hendrixson turned to watching point-of-view demos, particularly of his idols, John [...] "ZeRo4" [...] Hill and Anton [...] "Cooller" [...] Singov. When asked about his inability to train during his early years, Hendrixson stated, [...] "I <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it.

He had exhausted the fact before it happened. Since first he had thought of it there had passed four long years, and in that time he had seen it from every aspect, exhausted every possibility.

Due to these individuals having higher instances of thought suppression, they experience dream rebound more often. Cognitive load also plays a role in ironic control theory. Studies have shown that a greater cognitive load results in an increased possibility of dream rebound occurring. In other words, when one tries to retain a heavy load of information before going to sleep, there is a high chance of that information manifesting itself within the dream. There is a greater degree of dream rebound in those with a higher cognitive load opposed to those whose load was absent. With the enhancement of a high cognitive load, ironic control theory states thought suppression is more likely to occur and lead to dream rebound.|$|E
