5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E

25|$|Younis {{had been}} demoted from A {{category}} contract to B category contract by Pakistan Cricket Board. This sparked a media controversy as analysts, former players and cricket fans expressed outrage against the decision with many stating that a player of Younis' stature does not deserve <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> this. Eventually the Board {{gave in to}} the pressure and Younis was promoted back to A category.|$|E

25|$|As {{discussed}} earlier, momentary attractions (or repulsions) between particles have {{an effect}} on gas dynamics. In physical chemistry, the name given to these intermolecular forces is van der Waals force. These forces {{play a key role in}} determining physical properties of a gas such as viscosity and flow rate (see physical characteristics section). Ignoring these forces in certain conditions (see Kinetic-molecular theory) allows a real gas <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> an ideal gas. This assumption allows the use of ideal gas laws which greatly simplifies calculations.|$|E
25|$|In the Taikang era (280–289), Emperor Wu {{issued an}} {{imperial}} edict to praise Xun Xu for his talents and contributions, {{and said that}} he was capable of assuming greater responsibilities. He then appointed Xun Xu as a Household Counsellor (光祿大夫) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> one of the Three Ducal Ministers, as well as allowing Xun Xu to have his own administrative office, in addition to his existing appointments as Supervisor of the Palace Writers (中書監) and Palace Attendant (侍中). Around the time, Jia Chong and Li Yin (李胤) were already dead and the position of Crown Prince's Grand Tutor (太子太傅) was vacant. Xun Xu wrote a memorial to Emperor Wu, nominating Yang Yao (楊珧) to be the Crown Prince's Grand Tutor, and either Wei Guan or Shan Tao to be the new Minister over the Masses. Emperor Wu accepted his suggestions.|$|E

The law also exempts federally chartered savings banks, installment plan sellers and chartered loan companies from state usury (unlimited high interest rates) limits. The law also allowed home equity loans <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> just <b>like</b> mortgages.|$|R

A register number <b>is</b> written <b>to</b> the FSR, {{after which}} reads from or writes to INDF will actually <b>be</b> <b>to</b> {{or from the}} register pointed to by FSR. Later devices extended this concept with post- and pre- increment/decrement for greater efficiency in accessing sequentially stored data.

Once I hopped a ride on behind a big fire engine. I {{got a lot of}} credit from the gang for that." [...] A close friend, a younger boy who lived in her building, burned to death in her presence after an accident. In 1919, Bow enrolled in Bay Ridge High School for Girls. [...] "I wore sweaters and old skirts...didn't want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> a girl...there was one boy who had always been my pal... he kissed me... I wasn't sore.

The locality {{is named after}} them, and some thirty-five to forty families live there. They regret, [...] "earlier, we used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> any other artist. Today, we are just another component of the Puja paraphernalia, {{who are supposed to}} perform on those days." [...] Earlier, they used to be from around Mahalaya, but now go only for the five days. The importance of dhakis has diminished because of some people's preference for electronic music and bands. These days, some of the Nottos make dhaks. A dhak made of mango wood and goat skin sells for around Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,500, leaving a profit of only Rs 50. Some have taken to other professions.|$|E

2500|$|Political {{changes were}} another {{cause of the}} flapper culture. World War I reduced {{the grip of the}} class system {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, {{encouraging}} different classes to mingle and share their sense of freedom. Women finally won the right to vote in the United States on August 26, 1920. Women wanted to be men's social equals and were faced with the difficult realization of the larger goals of feminism: individuality, full political participation, economic independence, and 'sex rights'. They wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> men and go smoking and drinking. In addition, many women had more opportunities in the workplace and had even taken traditionally male jobs such as doctors, lawyers, engineers and pilots. The rise of consumerism also promoted the ideals of [...] "fulfilment and freedom", which encouraged women to think independently about their garments, careers, social activities.|$|E
2500|$|Gates {{encouraged}} Congress to {{act quickly}} to repeal the law so that the military could carefully adjust rather than face a court decision requiring it to lift the policy immediately. The United States Senate held two days of hearings on December 2 and 3, 2010, to consider the CRWG report. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Joint Chiefs Chairman Michael Mullen urged immediate repeal. The heads of the Marine Corps, Army, and Navy all advised against immediate repeal and expressed varied views on its eventual repeal. Oliver North, writing in National Review the next week, said that Gates' testimony showed [...] "a deeply misguided commitment to political correctness". He interpreted the CRWG's data as indicating a high risk {{that large numbers of}} resignations would follow the repeal of DADT. Service members, especially combat troops, he wrote, [...] "deserve better than <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> lab rats in Mr. Obama's radical social experiment".|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the {{rehearsal}} period, the New York newspapers {{were filled with}} articles about gang warfare, keeping the show's plot timely. Robbins kept the cast members playing the Sharks and the Jets separate in order to discourage them from socializing {{with each other and}} reminded everyone of the reality of gang violence by posting news stories on the bulletin board backstage. Robbins wanted a gritty realism from his sneaker- and jeans-clad cast. He gave the ensemble more freedom than Broadway dancers had previously been given to interpret their roles, and the dancers were thrilled <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> actors instead of just choreographed bodies. As {{the rehearsal}}s wore on, Bernstein fought to keep his score together, as other members of the team called on him to cut out {{more and more of the}} sweeping or complex [...] "operatic" [...] passages. Columbia Records initially declined to record the cast album, saying the score was too depressing and too difficult.|$|E

The parade received substantial police protection, and no anti-gay violence was reported. It was more festive than in previous years, with pop music, balloons and giant rainbow flags. Several European officials attended, including MEPs Michael Cashman, Michel Teychenné and Helene Goudin, the Ambassadors of the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic and Sweden, {{the directors of the}} Polish Institute and Goethe Institute in Bucharest, and Boris Dittrich, the LGBT rights director at Human Rights Watch. During the parade, British Ambassador Robin Barnett announced that the United Kingdom supported the gay rights struggle and was pleased at the [...] "fantastic celebration" [...] for diversity taking place in Bucharest. The Dutch Ambassador, Jaap Louis Werner, also held a speech, stating, [...] "We are here to show our solidarity. We know what you want.

Rice arrived in Georgia on 9 July. [...] "Frankly, {{some of the things}} that Russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region," [...] she said in Tbilisi.
