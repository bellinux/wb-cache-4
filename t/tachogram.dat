50|$|The {{concept of}} HRT was {{introduced}} to the medical community by Georg Schmidt and colleagues from the Munich University of Technology in 1999 in the British medical journal the Lancet. While studying PVC characteristics, Schmidt and his colleagues had noticed that heart rate seemed to speed up after a PVC. To get a clearer picture, they listed the time from one heartbeat's R-wave to the next R-wave (called RR intervals) and synchronized these lists to the time of the PVC beat and averaged the values in the list. A plot of this averaged RR interval list (called a PVC <b>tachogram)</b> not only confirmed their observation that heart rate sped up for a few beats after a PVC, but highlighted another less obvious feature, that heart rate then slows down beyond what it was before the PVC, before returning to the original heart rate.|$|E

40|$|Both {{heart rate}} {{variability}} (HRV) and heart rate turbulence (HRT) are established tools to study cardiac autonomic activity. Short-term studies of HRV had {{been reported to be}} stable for autonomic function assessment. However, there is little information on whether short-term HRT assessment is comparable to 24 h assessment. The aim of the study is to identify the relationship of HRT values between the 24 h and isolated <b>tachogram</b> measurements. We collected 24 h Holter recordings from 116 patients attending the outpatient department. HRT parameters were assessed for 24 h. Using the conventional method, HRT parameters were calculated using the average of tachograms over long-term recordings. In an alternative method, HRT parameters were obtained from each <b>tachogram.</b> We calculated a mean value for each subject by averaging the whole HRT data of every <b>tachogram.</b> Correlation analysis between the two groups of HRT values was performed. The results showed a high correlation between the two methods in turbulence slope (TS) (P&lt; 0. 001; r= 0. 84) and an extremely significant correlation in turbulence onset (TO) (P&lt; 0. 001; r= 0. 99). The values of TS were increased when assessed by separate <b>tachogram.</b> The variations became prominent when TS values calculated by the conventional method were low. HRT is as useful by separate <b>tachogram</b> assessment as by the standard Holter recordings. However, the TS values should be redefined. In subjects with abnormal turbulence slope (&lt; 2. 5) calculated by averaging long-term recordings, the possibility of TS values blunted by diverse regression slope sequences in separate tachograms should be taken into consideration...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Investigations {{of fetal}} heart {{rate in the}} course of {{pregnancy}} have suggested that its varia-bility may reflect nonlinear processes. In this study we examined 43 fetal RR <b>tachograms</b> derived from magnetocardiographic recordings in 8 healthy pregnancies. Irregularity in the RR interval sequen-ces was quantified with the help of approximate en-tropy (ApEn). ApEn of the RR interval time series increased with gestational age. The use of surrogate data showed that this increase of irregula ity is due to an increase of the nonlinear component in the heart rate. Furthermore, {{on the basis of a}} binary representation of the RR <b>tachograms,</b> it could be demonstrated that the dependency on gestational age resulted from the absolute values of the RR interval and not just from the dynamics of lengthening or shortening of the beat period...|$|R
40|$|Heart rate {{variability}} (HRV) {{has been}} used as a non-invasive marker of the activity of the autonomic nervous system and its spectrum analysis gives a measure of the sympatho-vagal balance. If short segments are used in an attempt to improve temporal resolution, autoregressive spectral estimation, where the model order must be estimated, is preferred. In this paper we compare four criteria for the estimation of the 'optimum' model order for an autoregressive (AR) process applied to short segments of <b>tachograms</b> used for HRV analysis. The criteria used were Akaike's final prediction error, Akaike's information criterion, Parzen's criterion of autoregressive transfer function and Rissanen's minimum description length method, and they were first applied to <b>tachograms</b> to verify (i) the range and distribution of model orders obtained and (ii) if the different techniques suggest the same model order for the same frames. The four techniques were then tested using a true AR process of known order p = 6; this verified the ability of the criteria to estimate the correct order of a true AR process and the effect, on the spectrum, of choosing a wrong model order was also investigated. It was found that all the four criteria underestimate the true AR order; specifying a fixed model order was then looked at and it is recommended that an AR order not less than p = 16, should be used for spectral analysis of short segments of <b>tachograms...</b>|$|R

Resting state eyes-closed electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocardiographic (ECG) data were recorded (10 - 20 System) in 42 healthy adults. EEG rhythms of interest were high-frequency alpha (10. 5 - 13 Hz) and low-frequency beta (13 - 20 Hz), which are supposed to form Rolandic mu rhythms. Rolandic and occipital (control) EEG sources were estimated by LORETA software. Results showed a statistically significant (p< 0. 05, corrected) negative correlation across all subjects between Rolandic cortical sources of low-frequency beta rhythms and the low-frequency band power (LF, 0. 04 - 0. 15 Hz) of <b>tachogram</b> spectrum as an index of HRV. The lower the amplitude of Rolandic sources of low-frequency beta rhythms (as a putative sign of activity of somatomotor cortex), the higher the LF band power of <b>tachogram</b> spectrum (as a putative sign of sympathetic activity).

Heart rate variability (HRV) is an established measure for classification of autonomic function regulating heart rate, based on the interbeat interval time series derived from a raw ECG recording. Results of this paper show that the length (number of interbeat intervals) and preprocessing of the <b>tachogram</b> affect the HRV analysis outcome. The comparison was based on <b>tachogram</b> lengths of 250, 300, 350, and 400 RR-intervals and five preprocessing approaches.

40|$|Conventional {{frequency}} domain analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) in vivo uses <b>tachograms</b> computed as interbeat interval vs. beat number. Inferences drawn from this analysis are flawed since it ignores the effects of non-uniform sampling. We compared the conventional technique (interbeat interval vs. beat number, CT) to a novel technique (interbeat interval vs. time of occurrence of beat, NT) for the {{frequency domain}} analysis of HRV. Guinea pig hearts (n= 6) were perfused at a constant pressure of 55 mmHg with Kreb 2 ̆ 7 s-Ringers (KR, 37 oC) solution. After 30 min baseline (BL) stabilization, hearts were subjected to 30 min global ischemia and 120 min reperfusion (REP). Bipolar electrograms were recorded from the right ventricle for 4 min each at BL, and after 0 min (REP 00), 60 min (REP 60), and 120 min (REP 120) of REP. <b>Tachograms</b> were computed using CT and NT. For CT the estimated sampling frequency (fs) = 1 Hz and for NT <b>tachograms</b> were interpolated to fs= 40 Hz. We computed: a) total power (TP, 0. 04 - 0. 4 Hz for CT and 0. 12 - 16 Hz for NT), b) ratio of power in low frequency (0. 04 - 0. 15 Hz for CT and 1. 6 to 6 Hz for NT) to high frequency (0. 15 - 0. 4 for CT and 6 to 16 Hz for NT) (LF/HF). Results showed: i) during REP 00, TP increased more with NT than CT, ii) LF/HF showed no change after REP with CT. Conversely, as noted in vivo, LF/HF decreased after REP with NT.

40|$|Heart rate {{variability}} (HRV), {{the changes}} in the beat-to-beat heart rate calculated from the electrocardiogram (ECG), is a key indicator of an individual's cardiovascular condition. Assessment of HRV has been shown to aid clinical diagnosis and intervention strategies. However, the variety of HRV estimation methods and contradictory reports in this field indicate {{that there is a need}} for a more rigorous investigation of these methods as aids to clinical evaluation. This thesis investigates the development of appropriate HRV signal processing techniques in the context of pilot studies in two fields of potential application, sleep and head-up tilting (HUT). A novel method for characterising normality in the ECG using both timing information and morphological characteristics is presented. A neural network, used to learn the beat-to-beat variations in ECG waveform morphology, is shown to provide a highly sensitive technique for identifying normal beats. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based frequency-domain HRV techniques, which require re-sampling of the inherently unevenly sampled heart beat time-series (RR <b>tachogram)</b> to produce an evenly sampled time series, are then explored using a new method for producing an artificial RR <b>tachogram.</b> Re-sampling is shown to produce a significant error in the estimation of an (entirely specified) artificial RR <b>tachogram.</b> The Lomb periodogram, a method which requires no re-sampling and is applicable to the unevenly sampled nature of the signal is investigated. Experiments demonstrate that the Lomb periodogram is superior to the FFT for evaluating HRV measured by the LF/HF-ratio, a ratio of the low to high frequency power in the RR <b>tachogram</b> within a specified band (0. 04 - 0. 4 Hz). The effect of adding artificial ectopic beats in the RR <b>tachogram</b> is then considered and it is shown that ectopic beats significantly alter the spectrum and therefore must be removed or replaced. Replacing ectopic beats by phantom beats is compared to the case of ectopic-realted RR interval removal for the FFT and Lomb methods for varying levels of ectopy. The Lomb periodogram is shown to provide a signficantly better estimate of the LF/HF- ratio under these conditions and is a robust method for measuring the LF/HF-ratio in the presence of (a possibly unknown number of) ectpoic beats or artefacts. The Lomb peridogram and FFT-based techniques are applied to a database of sleep apnoeic and normal subjects. A new method of assessing HRV during sleep is proposed to minimise the confounding effects on HRV of changes due to changing mental activity. Estimation of LF/HF-ratio using the Lomb technique is shown to separate these two patient groups more effectively than with FFT-based techniques. Results are also presented for the application of these methods to controlled (HUT) studies on subjects with syncope, an autonomic nervous system problem, which indicate that the techniques developed in this thesis may provide a method for differentiating between sub-classes of syncope. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Heart Rate Turbulence (HRT) is the {{transient}} ac-celeration {{and subsequent}} deceleration {{of the heart}} rate after a premature ventricular complex (PVC), {{and it has been}} shown to be a strong risk stratification criterion in patients with cardiac disease. In order to reduce the noise level of the HRT signal, con-ventional measurements of HRT use a patient-averaged template of post-PVC <b>tachograms</b> (PPT), hence providing with long-term HRT indices. We hypothesize that the reduction of the noise level at each isolated PPT, using signal processing techniques, will allow to estimate short-term HRT indices. Accordingly, its application could be extended to patients with reduced number of available PPT. In this paper, several HRT denoising procedures are proposed and tested, with special attention to Support Vector Machine (SVM) estimation, as this is a robust algorithm that allows us to deal with few available time samples in the PPT. Pac-ing stimulated HRT during electrophysiological study are used as a low noise gold-standard. Measurements in a 24 hour-Holter patient database reveal a significant reduction in the the bias and in the variance of HRT measurements. We conclude that SVM denoising yields short-term HRT measurements and improves the signal to noise level of long-term HRT measurements...|$|R

Methods: A total number of 71 healthy subjects (Group I) and 64 newly diagnosed epileptic patients (Group II) were recruited from Al-Yarmouk and Baghdad Teaching hospitals in Baghdad from March 2015 to July 2015 and included in this study. The diagnosis of epilepsy achieved clinically, electroencephalograph record and radio-images including computerized tomography and magnetic image resonance. At the time of entry into the study, an electrocardiography (ECG) was done, and the determinants of each ECG record were calculated.

Eight patients of Group II had a significant pathological prolonged QTc interval compared with undetectable finding in Group I.

40|$|The {{variability}} {{of the heart}} rate (HRV) is widely studied as it contains information about {{the activity of the}} autonomic nervous system (ANS). However, HRV is influenced by breathing, independently of ANS activity. It is therefore important to include respiratory information in HRV analyses in order to correctly interpret the results. In this paper, we propose to record respiratory activity and use this information to separate the <b>tachogram</b> in two components: one which is related to breathing and one which contains all heart rate variations that are unrelated to respiration. Several algorithms to achieve this have been suggested in the literature, but no comparison between the methods has been performed yet.

We compared 28 trained athletes and 28 sedentary subjects and divided them into two age groups: 18 to 34 and 35 to 55 years of age. ECG was recorded during 2 minutes while the subjects were breathing periodically under metronome control. RR <b>tachograms</b> were obtained and heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated. In the younger subgroup (18 - 34 years of age) only the standard deviation of mean RR interval and the frequency content were significantly different. In the older subgroup (35 - 55 years of age), all measured parameters were significantly different. A clear peak around 0. 083 Hz, in coherence with respiratory rate, was observed in athletes and was present to a much smaller amplitude in sedentary subjects. these results show that regular physical training enhances the synchronization between heart rate and respiratory frequency, with a more pronounced effect at a higher age.

40|$|Background—Baroreflex-mediated {{parasympathetic}} stimulation has variable {{effects on}} {{heart rate variability}} (HRV). We postulated that a quadratic function would describe the relationship between HRV and parasympathetic effect better than a linear function. Methods and Results—Twenty-nine normal volunteers (15 women; mean age 39612 years) were studied after b-adrenergic blockade with intravenous propranolol. Five-minute ECG recordings were made during graded infusions of phenylephrine and nitroprusside to achieve baroreflex-mediated increases and decreases in parasympathetic effect, respectively. Time- and frequency-domain measures of HRV were calculated from the R-R interval <b>tachograms.</b> The R-R interval and the vagal-sympathetic effect (VSE 5 R-R interval/intrinsic R-R interval) were used as indices of parasympathetic effect. The data were fit to both quadratic and linear models. In each case, the quadratic model (with a negative coefficient for the squared term) was superior to the linear model. There was some evidence that age influenced the responsiveness of the HRV parameters with changing parasympathetic effect, although the regression analysis was significant only in the models for MSSD (P, 0. 03) and pNN 50 (P, 0. 001). Conclusions—The relationship between HRV and parasympathetic effect is best described by a function {{in which there is}} an ascending limb where HRV increases as parasympathetic effect increases until it reaches a plateau level; HRV then decreases as parasympathetic effect increases. Because there is marked interindividual variation in this relationship...|$|R

The aim of this work was {{to test the hypothesis}} that autonomic nervous cardiac modulation, as shown from HRV parameters, is present at the end of development and that it reaches a constant value during the last days of incubation. Embryonic chicken heart rate was obtained at the final incubation period (days 19 and 20) from ECG recordings. <b>Tachograms</b> were computed and time- and frequency-domain indices of HRV were determined. No {{significant differences were found between}} HRV indices from day 19 and day 20. The power spectra extended in two frequency bands with centre frequency around 0. 6 - 0. 7 Hz (low frequency (LF) component), and another around 1. 2 - 1. 5 Hz (high frequency (HF) component); the latter was shown to reflect respiratory sinus arrhythmia. A relation between mean RR interval and some HRV parameters (rMSSD, pNN 5 and HF power) was shown. HRV results obtained from embryonic chickens, showed the presence of modulation of cardiovascular function by the autonomic nervous system. The results suggested that sympathetic and parasympathetic activities have already reached a constant level at day 19 of incubation. High frequency oscillations (0. 78 - 2. 5 Hz) were detected and are considered to reflect respiratory sinus arrhythmia. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Both {{heart rate}} {{variability}} (HRV) and heart rate turbulence (HRT) are established tools to study cardiac autonomic activity. Short-term studies of HRV had {{been reported to be}} stable for autonomic function assessment. However, there is little information on whether shortterm HRT assessment is comparable to 24 h assessment. The aim of the study is to identify the relationship of HRT values between the 24 h and isolated <b>tachogram</b> measurements. We collected 24 h Holter recordings from 116 patients attending the outpatient department. HRT parameters were assessed for 24 h. Using the conventional method, HRT parameters were calculated using the average o...|$|E
40|$|Reduced {{ejection}} fraction (EF), possibly induced/mediated by autonomic abnormal activation, {{is one of}} the most powerful predictors of adverse outcome after acute myocardial infarction (MI). A deep understanding of the correlation between the autonomous functionality and the left ventricular performance in these patients is therefore of paramount importance. The autonomous function is reflected in the cardiac activity and, specifically, in the heart rate variability (HRV) signal. Given the cardiac activity nonlinearity, growing interest is being manifested towards nonlinear methods of analysis, which might provide more significant information than the traditional linear approaches. The aim of the present study was to investigate if non-linear HRV metrics change between MI patients with preserved EF (pEF) and MI patients with reduced EF (rEF). Data were acquired in the context of the cardioRisk project. Ten MI patients with rEF and six MI patients with pEF, admitted to Intensive Cardiac Care after a first acute MI episode, were studied. The ECG was acquired during a Holter recording and the <b>tachogram</b> was extracted. Sample entropy (SE) and Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC 1 and LZC 2) metrics were computed on five hour long <b>tachogram</b> portions. A significant correlation was found between LZC indices and EF in the whole population; SE, LZC 1 and LZC 2 were significantly higher in patients with pEF. Our results indicate that lower complexity characterizes the HRV of MI patients with rEF. Complexity reduction might be due to a simplification of regulatory mechanisms, which might explain why MI patients with rEF are at higher risk for subsequent non-fatal and fatal events...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{tilt test}} is a {{valuable}} clinical tool for vasovagal syncope (VVS) diagnostic, and its early prediction from simple ECG and blood pressure-based parameters has widely been studied in the literature. However, no practical system is currently used in the clinical setting for the early prediction of the tilt test outcome. The objectives {{of this study were}} (1) to benchmark the early prediction performance of all the previously proposed parameters, when nonlinearly combined; (2) to try to improve this performance with the inclusion of additional information and processing techniques. We analyzed a database of 727 consecutive cases of tilt test. Previously proposed features were measured from heart rate and systolic/diastolic pressure <b>tachograms,</b> in several representative signal segments. We aimed to improve the prediction performance: first, using new nonlinear features (detrended fluctuation analysis and sample entropy); second, using a multivariable nonlinear classifier (support vector machine); and finally, including additional physiological signals (stroke volume). The predictive performance of the nonlinearly combined previously proposed features was limited [area under receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) 0. 57 &# 177; 0. 12], especially {{at the beginning of the}} test, which is the most clinically relevant period. The improvement with additional available physiological information was limited too. We conclude that the use of a system for tilt test outcome prediction with current knowledge and processing should be considered with caution, and that further effort has to be devoted to understand the mechanisms of VVS. </p...|$|R
40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: The present work makes a {{contribution}} to the statistical analysis of medical time series. In particular, the work discusses the possibility of detecting the rate of fibrillation – observed in the atrium during atrial fibrillation - based solely on the statistical properties of ventricular interbeat-intervals. First the work concentrates on the statistical analysis of ECG-recordings and of ventricular <b>tachograms.</b> It presents a new method – the generation of so-called morphograms – which enables one to analyse the entire information carried by an ECG-recording without complicated pattern recognition. It is shown that this method is suitable for determining different states of health. Second the work concentrates on the analysis of the statistical properties of ventricular interbeat-intervals, observed during atrial fibrillation. It presents a new characteristic, statistical feature – an exponential decay in the distribution of those intervals - which has not been published before. Furthermore it is shown, that different statistical features of ventricular interbeat-intervals during atrial fibrillation are interrelated. In the following the work concentrates on the mathematical modelling of the physiological process during the conduction of atrial impulses through the AV node. In particular the work concentrates on the conduction model originally proposed by Jorgensen et al [...] It is shown that this model can be fully analytical described. Based on a detailed discussion of the original model and mathematical solutions for modified ones, two methods for determining the fibrillation rate are presented. The performance of these methods are demonstrated based on medical data. The present work demonstrates that during atrial fibrillation the rate of fibrillation can be determined solely based on the statistical properties of ventricular interbeat-intervals...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} presented alternative {{presentations of}} HRV feedback based on real-time Poincare ́ plots, which offer a {{faster and more}} direct feedback of heart rate variability than other approaches. We take a design perspective in creating biofeedback systems, which empower their users in matters of health and wellbeing, for instance, in coping with stress. In 2011 we discussed the relative advantages (more direct and faster feedback, more precise patterns visible) and disadvantages (lower outlier robustness and narrative adaptability) of real-time Poincare ́ plots. Now we ask ourselves whether a similar effect could be reached using the auditory modality rather than the visual. The main envisioned advantage is that feedback sessions {{can be done with}} the eyes closed and leaning back, which we assume is an excellent condition for relaxation. Our way of working is to develop experiential prototypes and explore the functional, aesthetic, and perceptive qualities of the feedback—with an emphasis on the form giving. Using a PPG sensor and the Processing programming envi- ronment we created a prototype, in which four variations of direct auditory feedback are implemented (besides visual forms such as traditional <b>tachograms</b> and real-time Poincare ́ plots). In each of these forms the aim is to map timing variations of the heart-beats to timing or dynamic variations of the sound. The motivation for this is the design principle ‘‘natural mapping’’, which would be violated when mapping timing information to more qualitative aspects of sound (texture, frequency spectrum, filtering) rather than frequency or amplitude, for example. Results on the effectiveness of the design propositions are not available yet. However, we shall demonstrate and discuss them, and in doing so we look forward to share our work with members of the BFE community and hear their opinion...|$|R
