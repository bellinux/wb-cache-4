2500|$|... 1967 {{marked the}} debut of the Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR) which until 1990 was the nation's only legal {{political}} party. It was officially defined as [...] "the nation politically organized"—in essence, the state was a <b>transmission</b> <b>belt</b> for the party. All citizens automatically became members of the MPR from birth. Among the themes advanced by the MPR in its doctrine, the Manifesto of N'Sele, was nationalism, revolution, and authenticity. Revolution {{was described as a}} [...] "truly national revolution, essentially pragmatic," [...] which called for [...] "the repudiation of both capitalism and communism." [...] One of the MPR's slogans was [...] "Neither left nor right," [...] to which would be added [...] "nor even center" [...] in later years. The MPR elected its president every seven years. At the same time, he was automatically nominated as the sole candidate for a seven-year term as president of the republic; he was confirmed in office by a referendum. A single list of MPR candidates was returned to the legislature every five years. In practice, this gave the party president—Mobutu—all governing power in the nation.|$|E

5000|$|The 1974 {{constitution}} enshrined the MPR's {{status as}} {{the vanguard of the}} nation. It stated that [...] "there exists a single institution, the MPR, incarnated by its President," [...] that the [...] "President of the MPR is ex officio President of the Republic, and holds the plenitude of power exercise," [...] and that [...] "Mobutism" [...] was constitutional doctrine. All citizens of Zaire became members of the MPR at birth. [...] In effect, the government was a <b>transmission</b> <b>belt</b> for the MPR.|$|E

40|$|The European Union has {{in recent}} years exerted great efforts to resolve the alleged {{democratic}} deficit. One of the main strategies for reengaging with the public was {{to reach out to}} domestic civil society organizations (CSOs). It was expected that CSOs would act as <b>transmission</b> <b>belts,</b> by uniting people for a common cause at the grassroots level and serve as sources of policy information at the EU-level. Despite lofted expectations, political scientists have recently scrutinized the potential of domestic civil society involvement in EU governance by pointing at the mobilization bias of organizations at the European level and the weak ties with the grassroots. To date, there is limited knowledge on why some domestic groups have been better able to serve as <b>transmission</b> <b>belts</b> between the grassroots and European level than others. However, insight in this is crucial to understand the precise potential role of domestic groups within the EU. The main conclusion {{of this study is that}} there is no latent tension between the dimensions of grassroots maintenance and EU mobilization, which together were assumed to make up for the <b>transmission</b> <b>belt’s</b> role. Moreover, the competition for the executives’ attention and domestic (financial) patronage partly explain for that (a) not all groups are equally receptive to the interests of their members and (b) not all groups are similarly effective in transmitting the interests of their members to the relevant political actors in the EU...|$|R

50|$|Many {{influences}} have nudged modern Estonian eating {{into more}} diverse and open directions. Early influences that diversified the eating experience {{came through the}} Hanseatic League. Small Estonia has been conquered and ruled by many foreign powers, ranging from the Danes, Germans, Poles, and Swedes to the Russians. German nobles who colonized the Estonian countryside with hundreds of manors were modernizers over the centuries, and also acted as a <b>transmission</b> <b>belt</b> of Continental influences on Estonian cooking, although for a great many years, precious few of these influences trickled down to the impoverished Estonian peasants.|$|E
50|$|The Soviet Press {{conducted}} pre-publication censorship {{under an}} organization called Glavlit, which was the chief administrative arm of the censorship of the Press, and had a presence in every newsroom. The press provided the <b>transmission</b> <b>belt</b> by which these organizations sent information to their representatives in the general public. Each had censors {{to insure that the}} journalist did not go further than were allowed by the government that would read through every article prior to publication. This degree of censorship was not only for soviet writers but foreign correspondents who wrote for western publications.|$|E
50|$|A {{ribbed belt}} {{is a power}} <b>transmission</b> <b>belt</b> {{featuring}} lengthwise grooves. It operates from contact between the ribs of the belt and the grooves in the pulley. Its single-piece structure is reported to offer an even distribution of tension across {{the width of the}} pulley where the belt is in contact, a power range up to 600 kW, a high speed ratio, serpentine drives (possibility to drive off the back of the belt), long life, stability and homogeneity of the drive tension, and reduced vibration. The ribbed belt may be fitted on various applications: compressors, fitness bikes, agricultural machinery, food mixers, washing machines, lawn mowers, etc.|$|E
5000|$|From the 18th century onwards, the Bourbon {{kings and}} the {{government}} tried to establish a more centralized regime. Leading figures of the Spanish Enlightenment advocated for {{the building of a}} Spanish nation beyond the internal territorial boundaries. [...] This culminated in 1833, when Spain was divided into 49 (now 50) provinces, which served mostly as <b>transmission</b> <b>belts</b> for policies developed in Madrid.|$|R

There are Forbo Siegling service points in more than 300 places all over the world.|$|R
50|$|Originally, the {{relationship}} between the departments and the central government was left somewhat ambiguous. While citizens in each department elected their own officials, the local governments were subordinated to the central government, becoming instruments of national integration. By 1793, however, the revolutionary government had turned the departments into <b>transmission</b> <b>belts</b> for policies enacted in Paris. With few exceptions, the departments had this role until the early 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Portlandite (Ca(OH)2) {{represents}} the reserve of OH- anions in the solid phase. As long as portlandite, or the siliceous aggregates, has not become completely exhausted, the ASR reaction will continue. The alkali hydroxides are continously regenerated by {{the reaction of}} the sodium silicate with portlandite and thus represent the <b>transmission</b> <b>belt</b> of the ASR reaction driving it to completeness. It is thus impossible to interrupt the ASR reaction. The only way to avoid ASR in the presence of siliceous aggregates and water is to maintain the concentration of soluble alkali (NaOH and KOH) at the lowest possible level in concrete, so that the catalysis mechanism becomes negligible.|$|E
50|$|Actual power, however, {{rested in}} the Workers' Party of Ethiopia, {{defined as the}} leading force of state and society. More specifically, actual power rested with Mengistu, who was not only {{president}} of the country but {{general secretary of the}} WPE. He and the other surviving members of the Derg dominated the WPE's Politburo. In essence, the power structure set up by the constitution was a carbon copy of the power structure in other Communist countries. The party was granted even more power than the government, which acted more or less as a <b>transmission</b> <b>belt</b> for the party. The National Shengo, while nominally vested with great lawmaking powers, actually did little more than rubber-stamp decisions made by the WPE and its Politburo.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, O'Sullivan became {{first the}} {{director}} and then president of the Danube Institute, a Budapest-based think tank. The Danube Institute exists to provide an independent centre of intellectual debate for conservatives and classical liberals and their democratic opponents in Central Europe. Based in Budapest and Washington, D. C., it seeks to engage with centre-right institutions, scholars, political parties and individuals of achievement across the region to discuss problems of mutual interest. The Institute also seeks to establish a two-way <b>transmission</b> <b>belt</b> for centre-right ideas, policies and people between Central Europe, Western Europe, and the English speaking world, and to provide an authoritative source of rational and commonsense reporting and commentary for those covering Central Europe for the world outside the region.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{the provinces}} served mainly as <b>transmission</b> <b>belts</b> for {{policies}} enacted in Madrid, as Spain {{was a highly}} centralised state {{for most of its}} history. The importance of the provinces has declined since the adoption of the system of autonomous communities in the period of the Spanish transition to democracy. They nevertheless remain electoral districts for national elections and as geographical references: for instance in postal addresses and telephone codes.|$|R

50|$|Though some high-positioned {{collaborative}} Carlists {{like the}} Cortes speaker Esteban Bilbao were leaning towards cautious support for Carlos VIII, it was Cora y Lira who {{emerged as the}} most distinguished partisan of the cause. It is not clear, however, who has contributed most to engineering and daily execution of the Carloctavista strategy of total commitment to the regime. None of the sources clearly refers to Cora as to the brain behind the party game plan, though at least at some points he played {{a vital role in}} the planning process. Some scholars refer to him as merely a <b>transmission</b> <b>belt</b> from the Falange headquarters, where all the strings were pulled. Around 1950 Cora’s leadership went under criticism with emergence of Juntas de Ofensivas de Agitación Carloctavista, Movimiento de Agitación Social Católico Monárquista and Frente Nacional Carlista, new Carloctavista structures challenging the collaborative strategy. Though it was Cora who laid out initial reading of the Carloctavista claim, in the 1940s as legal expert he withdrew to the back seat; his 1932 booklet was replaced as key theoretical work first by an anonymous pamphlet issued in 1948 and then by a lecture published by Antonio Lizarza in 1950.|$|E
5000|$|DeMuth {{presided over}} the {{institute}} {{as a number of}} high-profile scholars joined AEI, including Charles Murray, Dinesh D'Souza, Richard and Lynne Cheney, Michael Barone, James K. Glassman, Newt Gingrich, Karl Zinsmeister, and Ayaan Hirsi Ali. As many as twenty AEI scholars served in the George W. Bush administration. AEI scholars also influenced the administration. Announcing his departure from AEI in 2007, DeMuth noted that the Iraq surge strategy was devised at AEI. DeMuth oversaw the creation of an AEI magazine, the founding a joint center on regulation with the Brookings Institution (DeMuth was a fellow at the center), the expansion of AEI's publications, the founding of AEI's National Research Initiative to underwrite and promote research by university-based academics and independent scholars, a reorientation of AEI's foreign policy division to focus on the Middle East, and the merger of the National Legal Center for the Public Interest into AEI to form the AEI Legal Center for the Public Interest. In addition to promoting the role of think tanks in public policy research and the flexibility that they have in developing innovative ideas over long periods of time, DeMuth has also been bullish {{on the role of the}} corporation in American life. [...] "They are [...] [...] [...] the single most important positive force in American politics," [...] he said in 1992. [...] "The corporation is the <b>transmission</b> <b>belt</b> of much of our saving, prosperity, and progress. It is the place where many Americans pursue their vocations and spend most of their lives," [...] he said in 2007. [...] "The corporation is a vital, reality-based counterweight to those for whom politics is primary." ...|$|E
