Veltmann responded that this line of evidence was news to him, too. The next day, Coakley gave the press a statement accusing Veltmann of coaching McPherson.|$|E

A central problem is the relation between systems which appear macroscopically dissipative but are microscopically lossless. We show that a linear macroscopic system is dissipative {{if and only if}} it can be approximated by a linear lossless microscopic system, over arbitrarily long time intervals. As a by-product, we obtain mechanisms explaining Johnson-Nyquist noise as initial uncertainty in the lossless state, as well as measurement back action and a trade-off between process and measurement noise.
