5|$|Bridgwater was {{selected}} as the first town in the South West, outside Bristol, to be selected for the UK government's Building Schools for the Future (BSF) initiative, which aimed to rebuild and renew nearly every secondary school in England. Within Bridgwater, BSF was to redevelop all of the four secondary schools and two special provision schools at an expected cost of around £100 million. This included the complete relocation and rebuilding of a new school combining the both Haygrove and Penrose School. In July 2010, several components of the Bridgwater BSF programme were cancelled and others were singled out for further review. Following a meeting with Education Secretary Michael Gove, Bridgwater MP Ian Liddell-Granger announced that the fate of all six affected schools would be subject to review, including <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> cancelled.|$|E
5|$|The peak of sutra copying {{occurred}} in the Nara period at which time the Great Perfection of Wisdom (Daihannya) sutra and the Lotus Sutra were the sutras most often copied. Most of the sutras were written in black ink on paper dyed pale yellow. However, some were made with gold or silver ink on indigo, purple or other colored paper—particularly <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> produced in 741 when Emperor Shōmu decreed Konkōmyō Saishōō sutras written in gold letters be distributed among provincial temples. Many sutra copies contain a colophon {{with the name of}} the sponsor—often somebody from the ruling class—and the reason of copying, usually related to the health or salvation of people or the state.|$|E

For the 2011 season, the Eagles did not wear white for any of their home games.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s Rhino Records {{issued a}} series of boxed sets of 78rpm reissues of early rock and roll hits, {{intended}} for owners of vintage jukeboxes.

These vinyl Rhino 78's were softer and would be destroyed by old juke boxes and old record players, but play very well on newer 78-capable turntables with modern lightweight tone arms and jewel needles.|$|E

Differing primarily in their range ( [...] versus [...] at [...] ), they {{were used in the}} formation of the final preliminary study, which was finished on 20 July 1936. Tweaks to that design resulted in the definitive design of March 1937, which was put forth by Rear-Admiral Fukuda Keiji; an endurance of 7,200nm was finally decided upon, and the hybrid diesel-turbine propulsion was abandoned in favor of just turbines. The diesels were removed from the design because of problems with the engines aboard the submarine tender Taigei. Their engines, which were similar to <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> going to be mounted in the new battleships, required a [...] "major repair and maintenance effort" [...] to keep them running due to a [...] "fundamental design defect". In addition, if the engines failed entirely, the [...] armored citadel deck roof that protected the proposed diesel engine rooms and attendant machinery spaces, would severely hamper any attempt to remove and replace them.|$|E

500|$|The game {{makes use}} of the Hedgehog Engine, the game engine Sonic Team used for {{developing}} Unleashed. To help decide which levels would appear in the game, Sega polled all their employees on their favorite Sonic levels, researched the core fanbase, and conducted an internet survey, with the levels they found most popular being <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> incorporated into the game. One of the main rules Sonic Team made during development was not to use older assets or level designs, and certain levels were given a new visual element to provide a new dynamic, such as the underground caves in Green Hill. In choosing levels for the 3DS version, the team opted to use levels from the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS Sonic games rather than the original Game Gear games, wanting to use levels from games of more recent memory. According to Iizuka, {{one of the hardest}} parts of developing Generations was adapting 3D levels to 2D, since their [...] "defining" [...] elements and themes were designed to specifically work in 3D. Recreating the [...] "classic"-style Sonic gameplay using the Hedgehog Engine was also cited as challenging, since the engine was designed for [...] "modern" [...] gameplay. The Spin Dash ability was also made quicker to use to help younger players unfamiliar with it. The team faced bigger difficulties developing on the 3DS; Iizuka claimed they were unfamiliar with the system's capabilities and limitations.|$|E
500|$|Unlimited Saga is {{the newest}} SaGa game, first {{published}} on the PlayStation 2 in 2002 and was composed for by Masashi Hamauzu; {{it has not yet}} received any sequels. Unlimited Saga has sparked two albums, a soundtrack album and a promotional single. In the liner notes for the soundtrack album, Hamauzu estimated that he had completed the tunes for the soundtrack at a rate of one per day. He also noted that the game was Square Enix's first [...] "all streaming audio RPG", which meant that the composer and synthesizer operator could use live recordings of each instrument in the final composition rather than using approximations created in a synthesizer. Despite this, some tracks, including [...] "Judy's Theme", use only synthesized sounds as the synthesizer demo created prior to recording a live version sounded so real as to not need to be re-recorded. Hamauzu said that the tracks that used live instruments almost exclusively were <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> [...] "Latin" [...] in style, such as [...] "Anxiety towards a Wonder" [...] and [...] "Battle Theme IV". Hamauzu also stated that for the soundtrack he reused several older pieces, with the oldest being [...] "Mysterious Plan" [...] which had been composed 10 years prior, though he said that amount of work that needed to be done to update the pieces required more effort than if he had composed a new piece instead.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{remnant of}} Mammut, a tooth some [...] in weight, was {{discovered}} {{in the village of}} Claverack, New York, in 1705. The mystery animal became known as the [...] "incognitum". The first bones to be collected and studied scientifically were found in 1739 at Big Bone Lick State Park, Kentucky, by French soldiers, who carried them to the Mississippi River, from where they were transported to the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. Some time later, similar teeth were found in South Carolina, which, according to the slaves, looked remarkably similar to those of African elephants. This was soon followed by discoveries of complete bones and tusks in Ohio; people started referring to the [...] "incognitum" [...] as a mammoth, like <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> being dug out in Siberia. Anatomists noted that the teeth of mammoth and elephants were {{different from those of the}} [...] "incognitum", which possessed rows of large conical cusps, indicating that they were dealing with a distinct species. In 1806 the French anatomist Georges Cuvier named the incognitum [...] "mastodon".|$|E
