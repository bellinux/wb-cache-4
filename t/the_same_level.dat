The {{purpose of the current}} study was to identity whether, for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>levels</b> of adiposity, BMI is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> across different age groups and gender. A two-way ANCOVA revealed significant differences in BMI between different age groups and gender (plus an interaction), using body fat (%) as the covariate, data taken from a random sample of the English population (n= 2993).
