40|$|RNA and DNA {{content of}} seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) larvae were {{determined}} from day 10 to day 60 after hatching in an aquaculture facility. Our results show a <b>two-phase</b> <b>modulation</b> of the RNA/DNA ratio throughout seabass larvae development. From day 10 after hatching {{there is an}} increase in the RNA/DNA ratio reaching maximal values at day 30 of age. Then, the RNA/DNA ratio decreased reaching minimal values at day 60 after hatching. These results are consistent with a high rate of protein synthesis during the first 30 days of seabass development compared {{with the rest of the}} developmental period studied. The results are compared with that of otolith growth carried out for the same species larvae. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a kind of {{two-phase}} PWMs when during each 1 / 3 of the period one of the motor phases is connected to the positive (or negative) dc bar and only the remaining two motor phases are switched between the dc bars. The novel accurate and the simpler approximated analytical equations of motor voltage harmonics are given and it is shown that the approximated equations provide a good precision of calculations. In comparison with three-phase PWMs this two-phase PWM – only for the same inverter commutation frequency – provides better quality of PWMs for high value of fundamental voltage. The realization of the two-phase PWM with 120 ◦ cycle is simpler than the other types of <b>two-phase</b> <b>modulation</b> but the transistor-diode load of the upper and bottom parts of the inverter bridge differs...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} motion-sensorless control method for {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motor drives when only the DC-link current is measured {{instead of the}} motor phase currents. A <b>two-phase</b> pulse-width <b>modulation</b> method is used, allowing the DC-link current to be sampled twice in a switching period at uniform intervals during active voltage vectors. A method is proposed for obtaining the current feedback for vector control, and an adaptive observer is used for estimating the rotor speed and position. The estimation is augmented with a high- frequency signal injection method at low speeds; a modified high- frequency excitation voltage is proposed for better performance. The proposed method enables stable operation of the permanent magnet synchronous motor drive in a wide speed range and under various loads. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated both by simulations and laboratory experiments. Peer reviewe...|$|R
