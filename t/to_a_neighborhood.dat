5|$|Exponentiation {{occurs in}} many areas of {{mathematics}} and its inverse function {{is often referred to as}} the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the matrix exponential. Another example is the p-adic logarithm, the inverse function of the p-adic exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case. In the context of differential geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent space at a point of a manifold <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> of that point. Its inverse is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.|$|E

The two hills separating their new home from Chinatown helped Wong to assimilate into American culture. She attended public school with her older sister at first, but then moved to a Presbyterian Chinese school when the girls became the target of racial taunts from other students. Classes were taught in English, but Wong attended a Chinese language school afternoons and on Saturdays.|$|E

Fearing for the dog's safety because Judd drinks and treats his hunting dogs poorly, Marty does not want to return Shiloh. His father insists that Shiloh be returned to his rightful owner and they take the dog home to Judd.|$|E

25|$|A {{fire alarm}} box is an outdoor device used for notifying a fire {{department}} of a fire. Early boxes used the telegraph system and were the main method of calling the fire department <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> {{in the days before}} people had telephones. When the box is triggered, a spring-loaded wheel spins and taps out a signal onto the fire alarm telegraph wire, indicating the box number. The receiver at a fire station then can match the number to the neighborhood. The municipal fire alarm system got its start in Massachusetts. It was invented by Moses G. Farmer, an engineer, and Dr. William Channing, a Harvard-educated Bostonian. Their revolutionary creation was installed in 1851 and consisted of 40 miles of wire and 45 boxes in Boston.|$|E

When the piece was performed at concerts, the band would pogo dance on stage. [...] "Rockaway Beach" [...] was written by bassist Dee Dee Ramone, and {{was inspired by the}} Beach Boys along with other surf music bands. The title refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> and beach in Queens which Dee Dee was a fan of, as confirmed by Tommy and Joey. [...] "I Don't Care" [...] is composed of three chords and features minimal text composition. The song is among the first pieces written by the band and was originally recorded as a demo that was released on the 2001 expanded edition of the Ramones debut album. [...] "Sheena Is a Punk Rocker" [...] was written by Joey, who explains that the lyrics are about a young female outsider named Sheena who strayed away from the popular disco and surf music and instead visited nightclubs and listened to punk rock. The mid-tempo song deviates from a three-chord pattern and starts off with Joey shouting [...] "Go!", followed guitar riffs deemed to have a [...] "raucous" [...] texture by author Tom Carson. The author also suggests that these chords [...] "bump" [...] into each other until the song's fade-out ending.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003 the New York City Department of City Planning {{issued a}} master plan that envisioned the {{creation}} of 40 {{million square feet of}} commercial and residential development, two corridors of open space – one between Eleventh Avenue and Tenth Avenue, and another network of open space between Ninth Avenue and Tenth Avenue to create a park system from West 39th Street to West 34th Street, portions of which would be located along the Dyer Avenue/Lincoln Tunnel Expressway corridors. Dubbed the Hudson Yards Master Plan, the area covered is bordered on the east by Seventh and Eighth Avenues, on the south by West 28th and 30th Streets, on the north by West 43rd Street, and on the west by Hudson River Park and the Hudson River. The City's plan was similar <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> plan produced by architect Meta Brunzema and environmental planner Daniel Gutman for the Hell's Kitchen Neighborhood Association (HKNA). [...] The main concept of the HKNA plan was to allow major new development while protecting the existing residential core area between Ninth and Tenth avenues.|$|E
2500|$|Pick a {{point in}} the unit sphere, v, so that {{orthogonal}} projection of the link to the plane perpendicular to v gives a link diagram. [...] Observe that a point (s,t) that goes to v under the Gauss map corresponds to a crossing in the link diagram where [...] is over [...] [...] Also, a neighborhood of (s,t) is mapped under the Gauss map <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> of v preserving or reversing orientation depending on the sign of the crossing. [...] Thus in order to compute the linking number of the diagram corresponding to v it suffices to count the signed number of times the Gauss map covers v. [...] Since v is a regular value, this is precisely the degree of the Gauss map (i.e. the signed number of times that the image of Γ covers the sphere). [...] Isotopy invariance of the linking number is automatically obtained as the degree is invariant under homotopic maps. [...] Any other regular value would give the same number, so the linking number doesn't depend on any particular link diagram.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his review}} for The New York Times, Gilbert Millstein wrote, [...] "its {{publication}} {{is a historic}} occasion {{in so far as}} the exposure of an authentic work of art is of any great moment in an age in which the attention is fragmented and the sensibilities are blunted by the superlatives of fashion" [...] and praised it as [...] "a major novel." [...] Millstein was already sympathetic toward the Beat Generation and his promotion of the book in the Times did wonders for its recognition and acclaim. [...] Not only did he like the themes, but also the style, which would come to be just as hotly contested in the reviews that followed. [...] "There are sections of On the Road in which the writing is of a beauty almost breathtaking...there is some writing on jazz that has never been equaled in American fiction, either for insight, style, or technical virtuosity." [...] Kerouac and Joyce Johnson, a younger writer he was living with, read the review shortly after midnight at a newsstand at 69th Street and Broadway, near Joyce's apartment in the Upper West Side. They took their copy of the newspaper <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> bar and read the review over and over. [...] "Jack kept shaking his head," [...] Joyce remembered later in her memoir Minor Characters, [...] "as if he couldn’t figure out why he wasn’t happier than he was." [...] Finally, they returned to her apartment to go to sleep. As Joyce recalled: [...] "Jack lay down obscure for the last time in his life.
