40|$|Foreign aid to {{the island}} economies is a major source for foreign {{exchange}} and resource needs. This paper presents an empirical analysis {{of the relationship between}} foreign aid and economic growth in the case of Fiji. A neoclassical production function is applied to estimate the aid-growth nexus. Since the data employed are time series for the period 1968 to 1996, the Autoregressive Distributed Lag approach to cointegration is utilized to estimate the models. Components of <b>total</b> <b>aid,</b> such as <b>grant</b> <b>aid,</b> loan aid, technical cooperation, bilateral and multilateral aid flows are also utilized to estimate a disaggregated short-run and long-run relationship between foreign aid and economic growth. The results show that <b>total</b> <b>aid</b> flows and its various forms, i. e. bilateral <b>aid,</b> <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> and technical cooperation <b>grant</b> <b>aid,</b> has a significant impact on economic growth in Fiji. As for domestic resources, only exports and private investments in two equations show positive contribution to growth. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Montgomery GI Bill provides a monthly stipend to pay postsecondary education expenses for veterans and eligible service members. Concerns have been raised about whether GI benefits adequately cover educational costs and whether the receipt of GI benefits affects other federal financial assistance available to postsecondary students under Title IV of the Higher Education Act and the Internal Revenue Code. Under Title IV, GI benefits do not affect the amount of aid veterans receive under the Pell grant and subsidized Stafford loan programs but may affect the amount they receive in unsubsidized loans and through campus-based aid programs. Depending on the program, GI benefits may be considered as another source of financial assistance for students, which may decrease a veteran student's financial need and thus the amount of need-based aid provided. With regard to available federal tax incentives, the receipt of GI benefits does not preclude veterans from claiming such benefits but may affect the amount they would be eligible to claim. On average, veterans and nonveterans with comparable characteristics are awarded similar amounts of federal Title IV aid. When GI benefits are included, {{the total amount of}} federal assistance is greater for veterans than it is for nonveterans. Moreover, veterans' <b>total</b> <b>aid,</b> including Pell <b>Grants,</b> Stafford loans, and GI benefits has a lower proportion of loans compared with nonveterans' packages. On average, veteran students received slightly lower average campus-based aid awards than did nonveteran dependent students, but they received more than nonveteran independent students at four-year institutions. The actual amount of HOPE and Lifetime Learning tax credits by veteran and nonveteran students is unknown. However, the amount of tuition and fees paid, amount of GI benefits and <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> received, and family income and taxes owed will affect the amount of tax credit one may claim. ...|$|R

40|$|With {{the act of}} 7 Match 2007 on {{support for}} rural areas with the {{participation}} of means from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development there was introduced {{a new type of}} contracts constructed in order to acquire payments. The aim of this paper is an attempt to determine the legal nature of the agreement of <b>aid</b> <b>granting</b> by this found. In this paper there were presented construction fundamentals of a contract when one of the party to the contract is Managing Authority (support is given after the administrative proceedings in particular case but the agreement is the source of obligations, there are restrictions of freedom of contracting, and the civil courts are competent to settle disputes). These features point to the civil – legal nature of the agreement. The agreement used in Polish agricultural transactions are of an extremely varied character. This agreement is similar to a contract of donation and to a contract of <b>aid</b> <b>granting</b> by the structural funds. Therefore, it is helpful, to compare it to these agreement. The analysis of provisions of the Polish act allows to draw conclusions on a very complicated legal character of the agreement of <b>aid</b> <b>granting</b> by the European Agricultural Found for Rural Development.

40|$|This paper re-examines {{the effects}} of foreign aid on growth {{theoretically}} and empirically, with a new perspective: that a third variable, conflict, is key to understand the relationship. While aid may be originally intended to increase growth rates by making investment more enticing, in countries with poor institutional frameworks aid may stir up conflict, reducing the growth rate. We build a model that incorporates these features, and show {{that the effect of}} aid on growth depends crucially on the institutional framework: when institutions are strong, aid increases growth; but when institutions are weak, aid enhances conflict, potentially reducing growth rates. The empirical analysis investigates these predictions. To address the potential endogeneity of aid, we exploit a new instrumental variable, {{along the lines of the}} Card (2001) instrument for immigration, where aid flows to one country in a specific year depend on <b>aid</b> <b>granted</b> to all countries that year and the average share of <b>total</b> <b>aid</b> received by each country in all periods.

40|$|<b>Total</b> <b>aid</b> to {{education}} {{more than doubled}} in real terms between 2002 and 2010, when it reached US$ 14. 2 billion. Since 2010 it has stagnated. As of 2014, it was 8 % below its 2010 peak of US$ 13. 1 billion. <b>Total</b> <b>aid</b> {{to education}} fell by almost US$ 600 million, or 4 %, between 2013 and 2014, even though <b>total</b> <b>aid</b> levels increased by US$ 10. 1 billion over the same period. This shows that most donors are giving education a lower priority within their aid budgets. Education’s share of <b>total</b> <b>aid</b> (excluding debt relief) fell from 10. 2 % in 2010 to 9. 5 % in 2013 and 8. 2 % in 2014.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{relationship}} between the change in town property wealth and the change in the state general fund equalization <b>aid</b> <b>grant</b> payment to a town in support of equalizing public elementary and secondary education per pupil expenditures in Connecticut. In addition to studying the change in total town property wealth, the subgroup of industrial and commercial town property wealth is examined. ^ The sample population for this study was the 169 towns in Connecticut. The independent variables measuring the change in town property wealth were developed using each town 2 ̆ 7 s Equalized Net Grand List data. The dependent variable measuring the change in the state general fund equalization <b>aid</b> <b>grant</b> payment to a town was developed from Connecticut 2 ̆ 7 s major state education grant program. This study involved an analysis of town data on a statewide basis and an analysis of town data aggregated into Education Reference Group (ERG) domains. ^ Six null hypotheses were generated to investigate the relationship between the change in town property wealth and the change in Connecticut 2 ̆ 7 s major state education grant provided to towns. Hypotheses One, Two and Three were examined through correlation analysis. Hypothesis One was rejected because a significant correlation existed between the change in total town property wealth and the change in the state general fund equalization <b>aid</b> <b>grant</b> payment provided to a town for 111 of the 14 change periods studied. Hypothesis Two was rejected, as a significant correlation existed between the change in town commercial and industrial property wealth and the change in the state general fund equalization <b>aid</b> <b>grant</b> payment to a town for 10 of the 14 change periods examined. Hypothesis Three was rejected because a significant correlation existed between a proportional change in commercial and industrial property wealth relative to total town wealth and the change in the state general fund equalization <b>aid</b> <b>grant</b> payment provided to a town for five of the 14 change periods. Null Hypotheses Four, Five and Six were not rejected. ^ This study concludes with policy implications and research recommendations. ...|$|R
