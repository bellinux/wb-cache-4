5|$|The When Harry Met Sally... soundtrack album {{features}} American {{singer and}} pianist Harry Connick Jr. Bobby Colomby, the drummer for Blood, Sweat & Tears, {{was a friend}} of Reiner's and recommended Harry Connick Jr., giving the director a <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> musician's music. Reiner was struck by Connick's voice and how he sounded like a young Frank Sinatra. The movie's soundtrack album was released by Columbia Records in July 1989. The soundtrack consists of standards performed by Harry Connick Jr. with a big band and orchestra arranged by Marc Shaiman. Connick won his first Grammy for Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{frustration}} at #1 Records obstructed sales contributed to tension within the band. There was physical fighting between members: Bell, after being {{punched in the}} face by Hummel, retaliated by smashing Hummel's new bass guitar to pieces against the wall. Hummel took revenge at a later date: finding Bell's acoustic guitar in the latter's unattended car, he repeatedly punched it with a screwdriver. In November 1972, Bell quit the band. When work continued on songs for a second album, Bell rejoined, but further conflict soon erupted. A master <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new songs inexplicably went missing, and Bell, whose heavy drug intake was affecting his judgment, attacked Fry's parked car. In late 1972, struggling with severe depression, Bell quit the band once more, {{and by the end}} of the year Big Star disbanded.|$|E

5|$|During {{a routine}} liposuction {{operation}} in Winnetka, Illinois, Dr. Harrison Lloyd (John Juliani) suddenly begins to remove so much fat {{from a patient}} that the patient dies. Following the unusual experience, Lloyd tells Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that he killed the patient because he was possessed. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical about Lloyd's claims, believing he's only making it up to escape legal consequences. Mulder inspects the operation room and discovers a pentagram burned into the floor; he begins to suspect that witchcraft might have {{played a part in}} the crime. Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning a hole through her cheek and neck with a surgical laser, severing her brain stem. Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember anything of the incident. Mulder's suspicions are strengthened when he reviews the <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second murder, and he sees a pentagram-like pattern on the stomach of the victim.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that medial <b>taping</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patella reduces <b>the</b> symptoms <b>of</b> osteoarthritis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee when the patellofemoral joint is affected. DESIGN [...] Randomised, single blind, crossover trial of three different forms <b>of</b> <b>taping</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee joint. Each tape (medial, lateral, or neutral) was applied for four days, with three days of no treatment between tape positions. SUBJECTS [...] 14 patients with established, symptomatic osteoarthritis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee and both clinical and radiographic evidence of patellofemoral compartment disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Daily visual analogue scale ratings for pain; patients' rating of change with each treatment; and tape preference. RESULTS [...] Medial <b>taping</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patella was significantly better than the neutral or lateral taping for pain scores, symptom change, and patient preference. The medial tape resulted in a 25 % reduction in knee pain. CONCLUSION [...] Patella taping is a simple, safe, cheap way of providing short term pain relief in patients with osteoarthritis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patellofemoral joint...|$|R

25|$|Upon {{watching}} the <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beating, LAPD {{chief of police}} Daryl Gates said: I stared at the screen in disbelief. I played the one-minute-50-second tape again. Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still I could not believe what I was looking at. To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E

Steen participated in hockey, soccer, and baseball, but never considered developing {{a career out of}} them—especially soccer, after suffering an injury at age 11—and instead considered becoming a professional wrestler after he and his father watched a video <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match between Diesel and Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania XI.|$|E

25|$|In January 2005, Rader {{attempted}} {{to leave a}} cereal box {{in the bed of}} a pickup truck at a Home Depot in Wichita, but the box was discarded by the truck's owner.

Surveillance <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parking lot from that date revealed a distant figure driving a black Jeep Cherokee leaving the box in the pickup. In February, more postcards were sent to KAKE, and another cereal box left at a rural location was found to contain another bound doll, apparently meant to symbolize the murder of 11-year-old Josephine Otero.|$|E

A <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bulletin survives and has been included in an ABC Radio audio compilation, also on the BBC tribute CD, Vivat Milligna.|$|E

25|$|Statements {{described}} Murray {{as someone}} using a non-standard CPR technique on Jackson. During the <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emergency call, released on June 26 {{one day after}} Jackson's death, the doctor was described as administering CPR on a bed, not on a hard surface such as a floor, which would be standard practice. The doctor's attorney said that Murray placed one hand underneath Jackson and used the other hand for chest compression, where the standard practice is to use both hands for compression. A Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) spokesperson said the 911 call came in at 12:21:04p.m. PDT (19:21:04UTC). Paramedics reached Jackson at 12:26p.m. and found that he still was not breathing.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 Unicorn Stencil Productions {{released}} the first documentary on Jandek, entitled Jandek on Corwood. It {{was directed by}} Chad Freidrichs, and produced by Freidrichs and Paul Fehler.

No one from Corwood Industries is represented on screen, but the label did suggest several people {{to be interviewed for}} the movie, including music critics Phil Milstein and Gary Pig Gold, and Katy Vine. Corwood's recommendation of Vine for the documentary is seen as essentially endorsing the contents and confirming the authenticity of the Texas Monthly interview. In October of the same year Jandek stunned the alternative music scene by playing live for what was probably the first time (see live performances section below for details).|$|E
