5|$|As a {{rotating}} proto-stellar disk contracts {{to form a}} star its shape {{becomes more and more}} spherical, but <b>the</b> <b>contraction</b> doesn't proceed all the way to a perfect sphere. At the poles all of the gravity acts to increase <b>the</b> <b>contraction,</b> but at the equator the effective gravity is diminished by the centrifugal force. The final shape of the star after star formation is an equilibrium shape, {{in the sense that the}} effective gravity in the equatorial region (being diminished) cannot pull the star to a more spherical shape. The rotation also gives rise to gravity darkening at the equator, as described by the von Zeipel theorem.|$|E
5|$|Elemental bismuth is denser in {{the liquid}} phase than the solid, a {{characteristic}} it shares with germanium, silicon, gallium and water. Bismuth expands 3.32% on solidification; therefore, {{it was long}} a component of low-melting typesetting alloys, where it compensated for <b>the</b> <b>contraction</b> of the other alloying components, to form almost isostatic bismuth-lead eutectic alloys.|$|E
5|$|Muscle {{cells have}} another {{specialized}} function of smooth ER. The ER membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol into the cisternal space. When a muscle cell becomes stimulated by a nerve impulse, calcium goes {{back across the}} ER membrane into the cytosol and generates <b>the</b> <b>contraction</b> of the muscle cell.|$|E

5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} the heart is called the endocardium. It {{is made up of}} a lining of simple squamous epithelium, and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the endothelium of the veins and arteries of the heart, and is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue.

5|$|A {{promethium}} atom has 61 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 4f56s2. In forming compounds, the atom loses its two outermost electrons {{and one of}} the 4f-electrons, which belongs to an open subshell. The element's atomic radius is the third largest among all the lanthanides but is only slightly greater than those of the neighboring elements. It is the only exception to the general trend of <b>the</b> <b>contraction</b> of the atoms with increase of atomic radius (caused by the lanthanide contraction) that is not caused by the filled (or half-filled) 4f-subshell.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine {{was that of}} a crisis, a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after <b>the</b> <b>contraction</b> of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E
30|$|In this section, {{we attempt}} to explore the {{possibility}} of improvement in IFS by replacing <b>the</b> Banach <b>contraction</b> condition or <b>the</b> Kannan <b>contraction</b> condition by a more general condition which is called, for convenience, <b>the</b> generalized <b>contraction</b> condition. One can easily see that such a condition generalizes not only <b>the</b> Banach <b>contraction</b> condition, but also <b>the</b> Kannan <b>contraction</b> condition. As a consequence, we can replace <b>the</b> Banach <b>contractions</b> in Theorem  2.2 (above) by <b>the</b> Reich <b>contractions,</b> thus give an affirmative answer to the above-mentioned open question (i.e., Question 2.1).|$|R

50|$|The fluid {{contents}} of the reticulum {{play a role in}} particle separation. This is true both in domestic and wild ruminants. The separation takes place through biphasic <b>contractions.</b> In <b>the</b> first <b>contraction</b> there is sending large particles back into the rumen while the reticulo-omasal orifice allows the passage of finer particles. In <b>the</b> second <b>contraction</b> <b>the</b> reticulum contracts completely so the empty reticulum can refill with contents from the rumen. These contents are then sorted in <b>the</b> next biphasic <b>contraction.</b> <b>The</b> <b>contractions</b> occur in regular intervals. High density particles may settle into the honeycomb structures and can be found after death. It is during <b>the</b> <b>contractions</b> of <b>the</b> reticulum that sharp objects can penetrate the wall and {{make their way to the}} heart. Some ruminants, such as goats, also have monophasic contractions in addition to <b>the</b> biphasic <b>contractions.</b>|$|R
5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces <b>the</b> <b>contraction</b> at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is an {{essential}} element needed in large quantities. The Ca2+ ion acts as an electrolyte and {{is vital to the}} health of the muscular, circulatory, and digestive systems; is indispensable to the building of bone; and supports synthesis and function of blood cells. For example, it regulates <b>the</b> <b>contraction</b> of muscles, nerve conduction, and the clotting of blood. As a result, intra- and extracellular calcium levels are tightly regulated by the body. Calcium can play this role because the Ca2+ ion forms stable coordination complexes with many organic compounds, especially proteins; it also forms compounds with a wide range of solubilities, enabling the formation of skeletons.|$|E
5|$|On December 27, 1976, the MBTA {{bought the}} B's northside {{commuter}} rail assets, including {{the entire length}} of the Fitchburg Line. The closure of the Lexington Branch the next month represented the limit of <b>the</b> <b>contraction</b> of the northside lines; as a result of the 1970s energy crisis and especially the 1979 energy crisis, a period of rapid expansion began in the end of the 1970s. Service to Ayer returned along with an extension to Gardner on January 13, 1980. Ayer has seen continuous MBTA service since 1980, although service beyond Ayer was cut from Gardner to Fitchburg at the end of 1986. The W just north of Ayer was finally abandoned in 1982, and turned into the Nashua River Rail Trail.|$|E

5|$|The {{electron}} of the hydrogen-like ununennium atom—oxidized so it {{has only}} one electron, Uue118+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 1.99 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature coming from the relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like francium is 1.29 and the figure for hydrogen-like caesium is 1.091. According to simple extrapolations of relativity laws, that indirectly indicates <b>the</b> <b>contraction</b> of the atomic radius to around 240pm, very close to that of rubidium (247pm); the metallic radius is also correspondingly lowered to 260pm. The ionic radius of Uue+ {{is expected to be}} 180pm.|$|E

5|$|The {{initial period}} {{following}} <b>the</b> <b>contraction</b> of HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome. Many individuals develop an influenza-like illness or a mononucleosis-like illness 2–4 weeks post exposure {{while others have}} no significant symptoms. Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include fever, large tender lymph nodes, throat inflammation, a rash, headache, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals. The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents itself on the trunk and is maculopapular, classically. Some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur. Neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or Guillain–Barré syndrome also occurs. The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks.|$|E
5|$|The {{proboscis}} (plural – proboscises) {{is formed}} from maxillary galeae and is adapted for sucking nectar. It {{consists of two}} tubes held together by hooks and separable for cleaning. Each tube is inwardly concave, thus forming a central tube up which moisture is sucked. Suction is effected through <b>the</b> <b>contraction</b> and expansion of a sac in the head. The proboscis is coiled under the head when the insect is at rest and extended only when feeding. The maxillary palpi are reduced and even vestigial. They are conspicuous and five-segmented {{in some of the}} more basal families and are often folded.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the distal}} {{arm of the}} third {{axillary}} sclerite rotates upwards and inwards, so that finally its position is completely reversed. The anal veins are articulated with this sclerite {{in such a way}} that when it moves they are carried with it and become flexed over the back of the insect. Activity of the same muscle in flight affects the power output of the wing and so it is also important in flight control. In orthopteroid insects, the elasticity of the cuticle causes the vannal area of the wing to fold along the veins. Consequently, energy is expended in unfolding this region when the wings are moved to the flight position. In general, wing extension probably results from <b>the</b> <b>contraction</b> of muscles attached to the basalar sclerite or, in some insects, to the subalar sclerite.|$|E

50|$|In {{the small}} intestine, local {{stimulation}} of the intestinal smooth muscle {{by the presence of}} food particles causes contractions that tend to travel from the stimulated point in both directions. Under normal circumstances, the progress of <b>the</b> <b>contractions</b> in an oral direction is quickly inhibited, while <b>the</b> <b>contractions</b> travelling away from the mouth tend to persist. If the intestine is paralyzed by applying such drugs as nicotine or cocaine to the intestinal wall, <b>the</b> <b>contractions</b> initiated by local stimulations travel equally well in both directions. Ordinarily, peristaltic waves appear in the small intestine at irregular intervals and travel for varying distances; some travel only a few inches, others a few feet. They serve to expose food to the intestinal wall for absorption and to move it forward.|$|R
5|$|Due to the {{stabilization}} of its outer 8s electrons, unbinilium's first ionization energy—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 6.0eV, {{comparable to that}} of calcium. The electron of the hydrogen-like unbinilium atom—oxidized so it has only one electron, Ubn119+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 2.05 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature coming from the relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like radium is 1.30 and the figure for hydrogen-like barium is 1.095. According to simple extrapolations of relativity laws, that indirectly indicates <b>the</b> <b>contraction</b> of the atomic radius to around 200pm, very close to that of strontium (215pm); the ionic radius of the Ubn2+ ion is also correspondingly lowered to 160pm. The trend in electron affinity is also expected to reverse direction similarly at radium and unbinilium.|$|E
5|$|Lexus' {{arrival in}} the Japanese market in July 2005 marked the first {{introduction}} of a Japanese premium car marque in the domestic market. New generation LS, IS, ES, GS, and RX models subsequently became available in Japan along with the SC 430, ending domestic sales of Toyota-branded models under the Celsior, Altezza, Windom, Aristo, Harrier, and Soarer nameplates, respectively. The Altezza and Aristo were previously exclusive to Japanese Toyota retail sales channels called Toyota Vista Store, the Windom was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store, the Celsior and Harrier were exclusive to Toyopet Store, and the Soarer was previously available at both Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations. Lexus models sold in Japan featured higher specifications and a price premium compared with their discontinued Toyota counterparts.

5|$|Many similar battles were fought {{between the}} {{succeeding}} Sultanate of Adal and the Solomonids, {{with both sides}} achieving victory and suffering defeat. During the protracted Ethiopian-Adal War (1529–1559), Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi defeated several Ethiopian Emperors and embarked on a conquest {{referred to as the}} Futuh Al-Habash ("Conquest of Abyssinia"), which brought three-quarters of Christian Abyssinia under the power of the Muslim Adal Sultanate. Al-Ghazi's forces and their Ottoman allies came close to extinguishing the ancient Ethiopian kingdom, but the Abyssinians managed to secure the assistance of Cristóvão da Gama's Portuguese troops and maintain their domain's autonomy. However, both polities in the process exhausted their resources and manpower, which resulted in <b>the</b> <b>contraction</b> of both powers and changed regional dynamics for centuries to come. Many historians trace the origins of hostility between Somalia and Ethiopia to this war. Some scholars also argue that this conflict proved, through their use on both sides, the value of firearms such as the matchlock musket, cannons and the arquebus over traditional weapons.|$|E

40|$|Pasteurella haemolytica leukotoxin is a {{ruminant}} specific leukotoxin {{that has}} been implicated in the pathogenesis of shipping fever in cattle. The present study was undertaken {{to determine the effect}} of this toxin on bovine airway smooth muscle. In vitro, the addition of culture supernate containing leukotoxin to bovine tracheal smooth muscle resulted in contraction of 55 % of the muscle strips tested. Maximum responses were reached rapidly during cumulative additions of this material. In 95 % of the muscle strips that responded, maximum responses were obtained after the addition of one or two cumulative doses. Repeated additions of culture supernate resulted in decreased responsiveness. Since responsiveness to other agonists was not affected, these results suggest the development of a condition similar to tachyphylaxis. <b>The</b> <b>contractions</b> were inhibited by antihistamines. Diphenhydramine, at a concentration of 10 (- 6) M (dose-ratio 7), and mepyramine, at a concentration of 2 x 10 (- 7) M (dose-ratio 56), blocked <b>the</b> <b>contractions</b> by 84 % and 100 % respectively. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>contractions</b> were blocked by the muscarinic antagonist atropine, but this inhibition was much weaker (46 %) and was present at high concentrations only. Inhibition of <b>the</b> <b>contractions</b> by H 1 receptor antagonists suggests that <b>the</b> <b>contractions</b> are mediated via H 1 receptors. Since the dose-response relationship is not typical of a drug-receptor interaction, it appears unlikely that the leukotoxin is a direct agonist of H 1 receptors.
