40|$|This article {{investigates the}} global ‘retail revolution’ through the path chosen by key {{people in the}} Norwegian trade network called <b>Technical</b> <b>Supplies</b> Partner (TSP). The story is told from the {{perspective}} of a single entrepreneur working closely together with an A-team of fiercely independent shop-owners who helped transform TSP from a voluntary association into a market-leading Scandinavian retail chain. The trade network then became a global supply chain, before finally nearly going bankrupt. Three main points are made. The first is that the ‘retail revolution’ occurred as the result of new technology and market liberalization, but only as these were mediated through people’s efforts at new venture creation. The second point is that entrepreneurship itself changes the conditions for entrepreneurship, and the third that ethnography is a good method for investigating how entrepreneurship changes the conditions for entrepreneurship...|$|E
40|$|The Armenian land {{privatization}} {{program is}} unique among former Soviet Republics {{in regard to}} the speed and completeness of its implementation. Armenia is the smallest of the Republics, with a population of 3. 7 million, and was left highly dependent on outside sources for energy and raw materials for industries, and grain for its people and livestock. Privatization, began in 1991, was largely completed by 1993. The greatly increased number of individual owners created a need for major restructuring of the industries supplying agriculture and marketing its outputs. Problems in the substructures from <b>technical</b> <b>supplies</b> to storage and marketing are described. Recommendations are for the adoption of policies in the substructural spheres of agriculture that will contribute to the future development of agriculture in Armenia. These policies include improved contractual relations, cooperatives, niche marketing, and restructuring of various service corporations. Agribusiness,...|$|E

40|$|Ship {{management}} {{evolved from}} an in-house {{function of the}} ship owners to a formal organisation to manage their vessels, performing the most basic functions of crewing, technical management, supply and compliance with statutory matters and industry best practices. Strategy followed by a shipping company in turbulent times is a key factor for gaining competitive advantage, improving its position against competitors and in general increasing its profits. The research problem {{of this study is}} to investigate the strategies followed by shipping companies in turbulent times and practices used to maintain their good performance. Therefore, the aim of this research is to review the existing business strategies and practices during turbulent times and identify those resulting in improving performance of shipping companies. The existing experience is based on the literature and the shipping executives’ perceptions on current strategies. More specifically, at a first stage, the work analyzes the shipping business environment and identifies strategies followed by shipping companies. Strategic anticipation is considered as part of business strategy in an unpredictable and potentially volatile environment, following brief description of best practices, such as flexible planning and resilience development. Then, at a second stage, the work identifies the most appropriate strategies and practices followed by shipping companies in turbulent times. Except for the existing literature, the experience is presented through statistical processing of questionnaires as well, which have been distributed to a representative sample of executives. Finally, at a later stage, the work discusses the results and draws final conclusions. The main result received through this research is that the main competitive strategies followed in turbulent times are cost leadership and differentiation. The quality and the cost of services are the most important benefits of shipping companies, which introduce technology innovations and implement best practices in Crew, Safety & Quality, <b>Technical,</b> <b>Supplies</b> and Financial management, giving them flexibility to adapt strategy and operations. The “winners” likely will be those companies that truly manage to “navigate” the changing ship business environment. A winning strategy might be the one that embraces a new sense of responsibility, better collaboration with all stakeholders involved, including partners, suppliers, vendors, and customers; assert sustainability as part of business strategy; enable effective management of sustainability impacts across and between value chains with civil society organizations, customers and regulators - to enable innovative solutions to be realized.
