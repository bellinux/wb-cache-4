He said, [...] "Benny spoke very quietly. You could almost never quite hear what he said. But he would <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> one and that one and {{had the ability to}} calm things down.|$|E

60|$|Presently Scowl {{left the}} hut to prepare me some broth, whereon Saduko at once turned the <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> subject of Mameena.|$|E
6000|$|Lady Georgina {{burst into}} a loud laugh. 'And to think,' she cried, 'that I <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> lackey from London to Malines without ever suspecting him! Higginson, you're a fraud--but you're a {{precious}} clever one.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Mrs. Wortle, [...] "he {{certainly}} is--no more." [...] There came {{a certain}} accession of sadness to her voice, as she reflected that, after all, she was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{woman of the}} death of her undoubted husband.|$|R
6000|$|I did not answer, {{for what}} {{was the use of}} <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> vile brute when my time was so short. So he passed on to Stephen and began to chalk him. Stephen, however, in whom the natural man still prevailed, shouted: ...|$|R
6000|$|The hermit, {{grinding}} {{his teeth}} in impotent rage, moved swiftly out of the bedchamber, {{closing the door behind}} him; and straightway the King heard a <b>talk,</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> effect, proceeding from the 'chapel':-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you bring}} him across here to us, Sir Ralph? I want to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> hero of yours, and I {{am sure that}} my {{daughter}} is longing to be introduced to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And then I must <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{doctor of}} yours,' said Karenin. 'But I {{would like to}} see a bit of this place and talk to some of your people before it comes to that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{he ought}} to know the things he DOES say," [...] said Tanny. [...] "He goes on, without {{considering}} the person he's <b>talking</b> <b>to.</b> <b>This</b> time it's come back on him. He mustn't say such personal things, if he's not going to risk an answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|The other morning I overheard {{the nurse}} <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{particular}} specimen. The {{woman is a}} most worthy creature, and she was imparting to the child some really sound advice. She {{was in the middle}} of an unexceptional exhortation concerning the virtue of silence, when Dorothea interrupted her with-- ...|$|R
50|$|The film is minimalist {{in that it}} is shot {{primarily}} with long takes; the pace is leisurely and there are long periods of silence. Mr. Badii is rarely shown in the same shot as the person he is <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> (<b>this</b> is partly because during the filming, director Kiarostami was sitting in the car's passenger seat).|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{heard what}} has been said," [...] she remarked, [...] "and I wish to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> man. Your wife is over there with Mrs. Aleshine. Will you please take a walk with her along the road? You may stay away {{for a quarter of}} an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't reckon {{things up}} at all," [...] Mr. Waddington confided. [...] "Why aren't you round and amongst 'em, Burton, eh? You're {{generally}} {{such a good}} 'un at rubbing it into them. Why, {{the only two people}} I've seen you <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> morning have left the place! What's wrong with you, man?" ...|$|E
60|$|Sam {{thought he}} might as well <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> groom as to any one else, {{especially}} as he was very tired with walking, and there was a good large stone just opposite the wheel-barrow; so he strolled down the lane, and, seating himself on the stone, opened a conversation with the ease and freedom for which he was remarkable.|$|E
6000|$|... "So's you can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> us <b>this</b> afternoonâ€”an' so's Dad won't be so dis'greeable," [...] {{she replied}} plaintively, poking the black spots on her muff.|$|R
5000|$|There's nothing {{going on}} now. I wish, but I've {{run out of}} time. I'm <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> one guy about adding four more hours to each day, but he's not real {{positive}} about it. Those {{are never going to}} end, because there's no reason for them to end. But I'd like to make them more regular. - Josh Homme interview with Billboard.com, April 13, 2007 ...|$|R
5000|$|Subsequently, {{the album}} title {{was changed to}} Brain Salad Surgery, which is another {{euphemism}} for fellatio. The phase was probably taken from the song [...] "Right Place, Wrong Time" [...] by Dr. John, which contains the line [...] "I been running trying to get hung up in my mind, got to give myself a little <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> time, just need a little brain salad surgery, got <b>to</b> cure <b>this</b> insecurity".|$|R
60|$|I stood {{regarding}} him, understanding him, learning marvelously from him. It is a {{fact that}} for {{the best part of the}} morning of the Change I forgot Nettie and Verrall as completely as though they were no more than characters in some novel that I had put aside to finish at my leisure, in order that I might <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> man.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis now of no moment," [...] {{returned}} the Pilot; [...] "my knowledge and my ignorance are alike immaterial, as {{the command of}} the party is surrendered to other and perhaps more proper hands. But I would <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> lady alone, sir; she is an acquaintance of my youth, and I will see her {{on her way to}} the abbey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I guess you'll have to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{man about}} that," [...] and the station-master indicated, {{with a nod}} of his head, the freight conductor, who was {{swinging}} himself down from the caboose, now come abreast {{of them on the}} track. A brakeman had also jumped down, and the train fastened on to the waiting car, under his manipulation, with a final cluck and jolt.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, no," [...] said Sir James; [...] "I feel a {{delicacy}} in {{appearing to}} dictate. But I have been <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> young Ladislaw that Brooke {{is making a}} factotum of. Ladislaw seems clever enough for anything. I thought it as well {{to hear what he}} had to say; and he is against Brooke's standing this time. I think he'll turn him round: I think the nomination may be staved off." ...|$|R
50|$|Beyond {{applications}} in disability, the Indian government was in <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> license <b>this</b> program <b>to</b> use {{in some of}} its schools to teach English, through the Aakash tablet project.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We'll drink {{our friend}} what's-his-name,' said Dick, {{holding up the}} bright frothy pot; '--that was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> you <b>this</b> morning, you know--I know him--a good fellow, but eccentric--very--here's what's-his-name!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the eternal," [...] said he, [...] "you are a cool man. Give me my coat," [...] {{he shouted}} to the bystanders, and they helped him on with it. [...] "Now," [...] said he, {{as they made}} to follow him, [...] "keep back. I would <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> gentleman. By the heavens," [...] he cried, when he had gained the room, [...] "I believe you are not afraid of me. I saw it in your eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gowf? Gowf?" [...] King Merolchazzar {{ran over}} in his mind the muster-roll of the gods of Oom. There were sixty-seven of them, but Gowf was not of their number. [...] "It is a strange religion," [...] he murmured. [...] "A strange religion, indeed. But, by Belus, {{distinctly}} attractive. I have an idea that Oom could do with a religion like that. It has a zip to it. A sort of fascination, {{if you know what}} I mean. It looks to me extraordinarily like what the Court physician ordered. I will <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> fellow and learn more of these holy ceremonies." ...|$|E
6000|$|That season {{came up to}} Simla one {{of these}} crazy people with only a single idea. These are the men who make things move; {{but they are not}} nice to <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> <b>This</b> man's name was Mellish, and he had lived for fifteen years on land of his own, in Lower Bengal, {{studying}} cholera. He held that cholera was a germ that propagated itself as it flew through a muggy atmosphere; and stuck in the branches of trees like a wool-flake. The germ could be rendered sterile, he said, by 'Mellish's Own Invincible Fumigatory'--a heavy violet-black powder--' the result of fifteen years' scientific investigation, Sir!' ...|$|E
5000|$|Moss No. What do you mean? Have I <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{him about}} <b>this</b> Pause ...|$|R
50|$|It {{was said}} that Cardano {{was always in the}} company of a {{familiar}} spirit who <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him. <b>This</b> may be a rumour originating from a habit of speaking to himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{your brother}} were here you wouldn't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me <b>this</b> way--he'd protect me, Gaston would!" [...] cried Francie, on her feet, seizing her little muff {{and moving to}} the door.|$|R
6000|$|I tried once, when, feeling {{how small}} my powers were beside his, {{to get him}} to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> same Mr. Yolland, whose work among the pottery people he tried to second, but he recoiled with a tone half scorn, half reserve, which showed that he would bear no {{pressure}} in that direction. Only he came to my sitting-room every morning, as if kneeling with me a few moments, and reading a few short verses, were to be his safeguard for the day, and sometimes he would ask me a question. Much did I long for counsel in dealing with him, but I durst seek none, except once, when something Mr. Ben Yolland said about his having expressed strong affection for me, made me say, [...] "If only I were fitter to deal with him," [...] the answer was, [...] "Go on as you are doing; that is better for him as yet than anything else." ...|$|E
60|$|Madame de S-- {{was pleased}} to {{discover}} that this young man {{was different from the}} other types of revolutionist members of committees, secret emissaries, vulgar and unmannerly fugitive professors, rough students, ex-cobblers with apostolic faces, consumptive and ragged enthusiasts, Hebrew youths, common fellows of all sorts that used to come and go around Peter Ivanovitch--fanatics, pedants, proletarians all. It was pleasant to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> young man of notably good appearance--for Madame de S-- was not always in a mystical state of mind. Razumov's taciturnity only excited her to a quicker, more voluble utterance. It still dealt with the Balkans. She knew all the statesmen of that region, Turks, Bulgarians, Montenegrins, Roumanians, Greeks, Armenians, and nondescripts, young and old, the living and the dead. With some money an intrigue could be started which would set the Peninsula in a blaze and outrage the sentiment of the Russian people. A cry of abandoned brothers could be raised, and then, with the nation seething with indignation, a couple of regiments or so would be enough to begin a military revolution in St. Petersburg and make an end of these thieves....|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, {{for four}} days and some hours after Mr. Bonover's Hint, Mr. Lewisham so far {{observed}} its implications as to abandon open-air study and struggle with diminishing success to observe the spirit {{as well as the}} letter of his time-table prescriptions. For the most part he fretted at accumulating tasks, did them with slipshod energy or looked out of window. The Career constituent insisted that to meet and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> girl again meant reproof, worry, interference with his work for his matriculation, the destruction of all [...] "Discipline," [...] and he saw the entire justice of the insistence. It was nonsense this being in love; there wasn't such a thing as love outside of trashy novelettes. And forthwith his mind went off at a tangent to her eyes under the shadow of her hat brim, and had to be lugged back by main force. On Thursday when he was returning from school he saw her far away down the street, and hurried in to avoid her, looking ostentatiously in the opposite direction. But that was a turning-point. Shame overtook him. On Friday his belief in love was warm and living again, and his heart full of remorse for laggard days.|$|E
60|$|It's no {{business}} of mine. I {{have no right}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you like <b>this.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Jack," [...] said Alton simply. [...] "Well, {{sit down}} there, and I'll try <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you. <b>This</b> is a devlish mess I've got into. Only {{heard about it}} ten minutes ago." ...|$|R
50|$|This has two interpretations. Under one reading, {{every woman}} <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the same student (the class president, for example), {{and here the}} noun phrase a student is specific.
