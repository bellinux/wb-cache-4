5|$|After the {{inception}} of Scouting in the early 1900s, some nations' programs have taken part in social movements such as the nationalist resistance movements in India.

5|$|Aside {{from his}} run-scoring, Barnes, who {{was well known}} for being eccentric, gained fame {{throughout}} the season for his fielding at short leg—just a few metres from the batsman—where he took 19 catches for the season.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First Crusade, Crusader armies assembled at Constantinople and promised to return to the Byzantine Empire any land they might conquer. However, Bohemond, the son of Alexios' former enemy Robert Guiscard, claimed the Principality of Antioch for himself. Alexios did not recognize <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> of the Principality, and Bohemond went to Europe looking for reinforcements.

5|$|Egyptologists {{have noted}} that instead of hiding their non-royal origins, Neferhotep I, his {{predecessor}} Sobekhotep III, and his successor Sobekhotep IV, remarkably proclaimed them on their stelae and scarab seals. This {{is at odds with}} the traditional Egyptian system where <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> of the new king rests mainly on his filiation. These proclamations of non-royal origins were possibly made to dissociate these kings from their immediate predecessors, in particular Seth Meribre whose monuments have been usurped and defaced.

5|$|From {{the time}} of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania and {{throughout}} the Reconquista, marriage between Spanish and Umayyad royals was not uncommon.
