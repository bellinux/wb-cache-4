40|$|Intestinal {{disease in}} cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) mice closely mirrors aspects of obstructive syndromes in CF patients. The patho-genesis involves accumulation of mucoid debris in the crypts that fuse with intestinal content to form obstructing mucofecu-lant impactions. Treatment involves modalities {{that increase the}} fluidity of the luminal content, such as osmotic laxatives and liquid diets. We investigated the effects of <b>talniflumate</b> (Lomu-cin, Genaera Corporation, Plymouth Meeting, PA), a compound that may be beneficial to treatment of CF intestinal disease based on three mechanisms of action: mucus synthesis inhibi-tion by blockade of the murine calcium-activated chloride channel 3 (mCLCA 3), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory effects, and inhibition of Cl/HCO 3 exchanger(s) involved in intestina...|$|E
