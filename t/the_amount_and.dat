5|$|Because the Earth's axis is tilted {{relative}} to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles {{at different times}} of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>and</b> distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).|$|E
5|$|DNA {{exists in}} many {{possible}} conformations that include A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA forms, although, only B-DNA and Z-DNA have been directly observed in functional organisms. The conformation that DNA adopts {{depends on the}} hydration level, DNA sequence, <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>and</b> direction of supercoiling, chemical modifications of the bases, the type and concentration of metal ions, {{and the presence of}} polyamines in solution.|$|E
5|$|Maraba's coffee {{plants are}} the Bourbon {{variety of the}} Coffea arabica species and are grown on fertile {{volcanic}} soils on high-altitude hills. The fruit is handpicked, mostly {{during the rainy season}} between March and May, and brought to a washing station in Maraba, where the coffee beans are extracted and dried. At several stages, the beans are sorted according to quality. The farmers receive credits based on <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>and</b> quality of the beans they provide.|$|E

5|$|The {{load borne}} by the two wheels varies not only with center of mass {{location}}, which in turn varies with <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>and</b> location of passengers and luggage, but also with acceleration and deceleration. This phenomenon is known as load transfer or weight transfer, depending on the author, and provides challenges and opportunities to both riders and designers. For example, motorcycle racers {{can use it to}} increase the friction available to the front tire when cornering, and attempts to reduce front suspension compression during heavy braking has spawned several motorcycle fork designs.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria {{contains}} several biologically active agents, {{at least}} one of which, muscimol, is known to be psychoactive. Ibotenic acid, a neurotoxin, serves as a prodrug to muscimol, with approximately 10–20% converting to muscimol after ingestion. An active dose in adults is approximately 6mg muscimol or 30 to 60mg ibotenic acid; this is typically about the amount found in one cap of Amanita muscaria. <b>The</b> <b>amount</b> <b>and</b> ratio of chemical compounds per mushroom varies widely from region to region and season to season, which can further confuse the issue. Spring and summer mushrooms have been reported to contain up to 10 times more ibotenic acid and muscimol than autumn fruitings.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} Netherlandish period, divine light {{was not well}} described: if a painter wanted to depict heavenly radiance, he {{typically}} painted an object in reflective gold. There was a focus on describing the object itself rather than {{the effect of the}} light as it fell across it. Van Eyck {{was one of the first}} to portray light's saturation, illuminating effects and gradations as it poured across the pictorial space. He detailed how an object's colour could vary depending on <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>and</b> type of light illuminating it. This play of light is evident across the panel, and especially seen on Mary's gilded dress and jewelled crown, across her hair and on her mantle.|$|E

5|$|Copper {{is used in}} roofing, currency, and for {{photographic}} technology {{known as}} the daguerreotype. Copper was used in Renaissance sculpture, and was used to construct the Statue of Liberty; copper continues {{to be used in}} construction of various types. Copper plating and copper sheathing were widely used to protect the under-water hulls of ships, a technique pioneered by the British Admiralty in the 18th century. The Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant, starting its production in 1876. The German scientist Gottfried Osann invented powder metallurgy in 1830 while determining the metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>and</b> type of alloying element (e.g., tin) to copper would affect bell tones. Flash smelting was developed by Outokumpu in Finland and first applied at Harjavalta in 1949; the energy-efficient process accounts for 50% of the world's primary copper production.|$|E
5|$|Domestic cats select food {{based on}} its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most {{strongly}} to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats may reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past. They may also avoid sugary foods and milk. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugars in milk are not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea. They can also develop odd eating habits. Some cats like to eat or chew on other things, most commonly wool, but also plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. This condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>and</b> toxicity of the items eaten.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, when Syria was a French mandate, it was {{proposed}} {{to build a}} dam in the Euphrates near the Syro–Turkish border. After Syria became independent in 1946, the feasibility of this proposal was re-investigated, but the plan was not carried out. In 1957, the Syrian government reached {{an agreement with the}} Soviet Union for technical and financial aid {{for the construction of a}} dam in the Euphrates. Syria, as part of the United Arab Republic (UAR), signed an agreement with West Germany in 1960 for a loan to finance the construction of the dam. After Syria left the UAR in 1961, a new agreement about the financing of the dam was reached with the Soviet Union in 1965. A special government department was created in 1961 to oversee the construction of the dam. In the early 1960s Swedish geomorphologist Åke Sundborg worked as advisor in the dam project with the task of estimating <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>and</b> fate of sediments that would enter into the dam. Sundborg developed for this purpose a mathematical model on the prognosed growth of a river delta in the dam.|$|E

5|$|Many {{distinct}} factors {{influence the}} strength of welds and the material around them, including the welding method, <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>and</b> concentration of energy input, the weldability of the base material, filler material, and flux material, {{the design of the}} joint, and the interactions between all these factors. To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{features}} found in sauropods that basal sauropodomorphs lack {{are related to the}} change in body size. The greatest regions affected by this are the hind limbs and pelvis. For example, an elongating of the ilium, size reduction of the lesser trochanter shelf, and semiplantigrade posture are some features that indicate <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>and</b> positioning of leg muscles being modified. Vulcanodon possessed these features, the latter of which is seen earliest in it. However, Vulcanodon does not have reduced distal phalanges, which are seen in Shunosaurus and all more derived sauropods. This means that while the muscle positioning of its legs were changing, they had not yet reduced in the distal region of the limb.|$|E

5|$|Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this, {{finding that}} large muscles and {{cartilage}} would have limited {{movement of the}} neck. They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like Diplodocus were smaller than previously believed, and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. The conclusions of Cobley etal. are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>and</b> positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine {{the flexibility of the}} neck of Apatosaurus and Diplodocus.

At the time, Ukraine was experiencing very high unemployment, and Arktikugol offered wages many times what was then offered in mainland Ukraine. Many miners not only had to support their immediate family, but also relatives. Vnukovo Airlines stated on Ukrainian television that the relatives would receive US$20,000 per deceased person.
