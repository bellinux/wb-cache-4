5|$|Capesize {{ships are}} <b>too</b> <b>large</b> to {{traverse}} the Panama canal and must round Cape Horn to travel between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Earlier, capesize ships could not traverse the Suez {{and needed to}} go around the Cape of Good Hope. Recent deepening of the Suez canal to 66ft (20m) permits most capesize ships to pass through it.|$|E

5|$|For males, social {{structure}} {{changes can be}} seasonal. During the six-month period between December and May a few males immigrate between groups. Established males transfer on average every 3.5years, although young males may transfer approximately every 1.4 years. Group fission occurs when groups get <b>too</b> <b>large</b> and resources become scarce.|$|E

The results from their pioneer paper pointed out that the civic conflicts do not be taken place by the residents that work within productive industries with higher returns.

5|$|A {{landscaped}} {{park with}} lakes and statues {{was laid out}} around the house, and the drive to the house was along a semicircular avenue of trees. Sir Edward died in 1766. Sir Gregory Page-Turner, 3rd Baronet considered the house <b>too</b> <b>large,</b> so in 1767 he sought to demolish part of it to create a smaller house. This proved impossible so in 1768 he had the entire house demolished.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} to use a lazy deletion strategy in which a key–value pair is removed by replacing the value by a special flag value indicating a deleted key. However, these flag values will contribute to the load factor of the hash table. With this strategy, it may become necessary to clean the flag values out of the array and rehash all the remaining key–value pairs once <b>too</b> <b>large</b> a fraction of the array becomes occupied by deleted keys.|$|E

5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists understand that there are limits to the how small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are <b>too</b> <b>large</b> become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E
5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is <b>too</b> <b>large</b> to dock in many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried {{to and from}} the ship in tenders, which can be used as lifeboats in an emergency. These are stored while at sea in davits alongside the lifeboats. To transport passengers to shore the tenders pull up to one of four loading stations, each of which has a large hull door that hydraulically opens outwards to form a boarding platform, complete with railings and decking.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of outgassing, comets leave in their wake a trail of solid debris <b>too</b> <b>large</b> to be swept away by {{radiation}} pressure and the solar wind. If the Earth's orbit sends it though that debris, there {{are likely to be}} meteor showers as Earth passes through. The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle.

40|$|The {{settlement}} of tools and devices of participatory democracy {{at the regional}} level in Europe, for few years, has been the occasion {{to wonder about the}} “scale” issue in the modern democracy. Indeed, in the specific case of French regions, the problem of a <b>too</b> <b>larger</b> scale, which could be argue against the idea of a regional active citizenship, is overcome thanks to two key resources: methodological “market” of participatory democracy and regional politics. Based on this empirical example, the whole “scalar” argument is now seen as a political argument (that could be contested or ignored) and not a self-evident truth. This definition leads to a proposition for a more clear debate about local democracy, which make the difference between political and technical issues...|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} early van der Weyden {{depictions of the}} Madonna, her head is {{slightly}} <b>too</b> <b>large</b> for her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg. This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the depiction of a body under clothing.|$|E

Four of Coffin's eight pallbearers were free blacks who had worked with him on the Underground Railroad. Coffin was interred in Cincinnati's Spring Grove Cemetery in an unmarked grave.

Cruit asked the club to leave his land after two years because the crowds became far <b>too</b> <b>large</b> and noisy.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of the {{domestic}} country, the subsidy is welfare improving. The 20 million subsidy is a transfer from the government to the firm hence it has no effect on national welfare (ignoring costs of taxation; as long as these are not <b>too</b> <b>large</b> the basic insight of the model goes through). Additionally the domestic firm gains 50 million which would have otherwise gone to the foreign firm.|$|E
5|$|If {{the target}} value {{is greater than}} the {{greatest}} value in the array, and the last index of the array is the maximum representable value of L, the value of L will eventually become <b>too</b> <b>large</b> and overflow.
