5|$|During the 16th century Reformation and Counter-Reformation, Western historians saw the Crusades <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> {{their own}} {{religious}} beliefs. Protestants {{saw them as}} a manifestation of the evils of the papacy, and Catholics viewed them as forces for good. 18th century Enlightenment historians tended to view the Middle Ages in general, and the Crusades in particular, as the efforts of barbarian cultures driven by fanaticism. These scholars expressed moral outrage at the conduct of the Crusaders and criticised the Crusades' misdirectionthat of the Fourth in particular, which attacked a Christian power (the Byzantine Empire) instead of Islam. The Fourth Crusade had resulted in the sacking of Constantinople, effectively ending any chance of reconciling the East–West Schism and leading to the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans. In The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, 18th-century English historian Edward Gibbon wrote that the Crusaders' efforts could have been more profitably directed towards improving their own countries.|$|E
5|$|From 1350 to 1400—the {{period in}} which the poem is thought to have been written—Wales {{experienced}} several raids {{at the hands of the}} English, who were attempting to colonise the area. The Gawain poet uses a North West Midlands dialect common on the Welsh–English border, potentially placing him in the midst of this conflict. Patricia Clare Ingham is credited with first viewing the poem <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> postcolonialism, and since then a great deal of dispute has emerged over the extent to which colonial differences play a role in the poem. Most critics agree that gender plays a role, but differ about whether gender supports the colonial ideals or replaces them as English and Welsh cultures interact in the poem.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} sign of dissent {{occurred}} in 1989 when a WCG minister, Gerald Flurry, published a manuscript outlining {{what he and}} others believed were disturbing trends in the work, including {{the beginnings of the}} doctrinal departure from what had been established by Armstrong. Flurry and another minister, John Amos, were disfellowshipped and went on to form the Philadelphia Church of God (PCG). The PCG began an alternative radio program and magazine, and {{over the next several years}} a few thousand WCG members left to join the PCG. Despite this, Tkach continued to implement additional changes in thinking including: the shift in emphasis away from observing world events primarily <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> prophetic interpretation; the removal of the prohibition of interracial marriage; the allowance of work on the Sabbath; the acceptance of the trinitarian doctrine; and the acceptance of the validity of other Christian denominations, among many other changes. Older Armstrong publications that supported the church's once unique doctrines were allowed to go out-of-print.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{in about}} 1950, with the {{publication}} of Psychology of Colonization by Octave Mannoni, The Tempest was viewed more and more <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> postcolonial theory. This new {{way of looking at the}} text explored the effect of the coloniser (Prospero) on the colonised (Ariel and Caliban). Though Ariel is often overlooked in these debates in favour of the more intriguing Caliban, he is nonetheless an essential component of them. The French writer Aimé Césaire, in his play Une Tempête sets The Tempest in Haiti, portraying Ariel as a mulatto who, unlike the more rebellious Caliban, feels that negotiation and partnership is the way to freedom from the colonisers. Fernandez Retamar sets his version of the play in Cuba, and portrays Ariel as a wealthy Cuban (in comparison to the lower-class Caliban) who also must choose between rebellion or negotiation. Although scholars have suggested that his dialogue with Caliban in Act two, Scene one, contains hints of a future alliance between the two when Prospero leaves, Ariel is generally viewed by scholars as the good servant, in comparison with the conniving Caliban—a view which Shakespeare's audience may well have shared. Ariel is used by some postcolonial writers as a symbol of their efforts to overcome the effects of colonisation on their culture. For example, Michelle Cliff, a Jamaican author, has said that she tries to combine Caliban and Ariel within herself to create a way of writing that represents her culture better. Such use of Ariel in postcolonial thought is far from uncommon; the spirit is even the namesake of a scholarly journal covering post-colonial criticism.|$|E
