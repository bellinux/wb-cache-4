5|$|Casualties in Greece {{included}} Mackay's son-in-law, Captain W. H. Travers, who {{was captured}} in the Battle of Crete. Mackay resolved to reform the battalions that had been destroyed in Greece, and to rebuild his shattered division from the remnants that had been evacuated to Alexandria. He developed a training program in Syria in which he attempted to apply <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campaign in Greece.|$|E
5|$|The British Army {{tried to}} learn <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First World War, and adopt them into its pre-war doctrine. In the 1920s, {{and much of}} the 1930s, the General Staff tried to {{establish}} a small, mechanised, professional army and formed the Experimental Mechanized Force but, with the lack of any identified threat, its main function reverted to garrison duties around the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|As a naturalistic writer, he was {{amongst the}} first English-language authors to absorb <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French realists, and was {{particularly}} {{influenced by the}} works of Émile Zola. His writings influenced James Joyce, according to the literary critic and biographer Richard Ellmann, and, although Moore's work is sometimes seen as outside the mainstream of both Irish and British literature, he is as often regarded as the first great modern Irish novelist.|$|E

5|$|Construction of Evstafi {{began on}} 13 July 1904, {{well before the}} formal keel-laying {{ceremony}} on 23 November 1904. Progress was relatively quick, despite the disruptions caused by the 1905 Revolution, and she was launched on 3 November 1906. Fitting-out, however, was considerably delayed {{by a number of}} changes made as the navy digested <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russo-Japanese War and she was not completed until 28 May 1911. Shortly after completion she ran aground off the Romanian port of Constanţa in October 1911, but was only slightly damaged.|$|E
5|$|Hood was {{the closest}} to {{completion}} and her construction was continued in case the Germans managed to complete any of their new battlecruisers. Admiral Beatty continually pressed to have Hoods construction expedited and for her sisters to be restarted, but the War Cabinet refused to approve either measure as nothing could be sacrificed in the shipbuilding programme to this end. After {{the end of the}} war the three suspended ships were cancelled as they could not fully incorporate <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{uses the}} {{combined}} image {{of fire and}} Pentecostal fire to emphasise the need for purification and purgation. According to the poet, humanity's flawed understanding of life and turning away from God leads to a cycle of warfare, but this can be overcome by recognising <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past. Within the poem, the narrator meets a ghost that {{is a combination of}} various poets and literary figures. Little Gidding focuses on the unity of past, present, and future, and claims that understanding this unity is necessary for salvation.|$|E

5|$|When {{the battle}} officially ended on 16 May, British Empire troops had made {{significant}} advances {{but had been}} unable to achieve a breakthrough. New tactics and the equipment to exploit them had been used, showing that the British had absorbed <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Somme and could mount set-piece attacks against fortified field defences. After the Second Battle of Bullecourt (3–17 May), the Arras sector then returned to the stalemate that typified most of the war on the Western Front, except for attacks on the Hindenburg Line and around Lens, culminating in the Canadian Battle of Hill 70 (15–25 August).|$|E
5|$|Construction of Ioann Zlatoust {{began on}} 14 November 1903, {{well before the}} formal keel-laying {{ceremony}} on 13 November 1904. Progress was relatively quick, despite the disruptions caused by the 1905 Revolution, and she was launched on 13 May 1906. Fitting-out, however, was considerably delayed {{by a number of}} changes made as the navy digested <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russo-Japanese War. For example there was a period of seven months in 1907 where virtually no work was done on the ship and she was not completed until 1 April 1911. Ioann Zlatousts turrets had originally been intended for a reconstruction of the elderly pre-dreadnought , but they were diverted to Ioann Zlatoust after that reconstruction was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{intended}} {{the show to}} have a progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter-culture of the youth movement, though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this. He wanted Star Trek to show humanity what it might develop into, if it would learn from <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, most specifically by ending violence. An extreme example is the alien species, the Vulcans, who had a violent past but learned to control their emotions. Roddenberry also gave Star Trek an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations. His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability, e.g., they opposed Roddenberry's insistence that Enterprise have a racially diverse crew.|$|E

5|$|The postwar {{years were}} spent {{implementing}} <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yom Kippur War. SEAD tactics were improved, training was {{stepped up and}} innovative technologies introduced. The Hammers cooperated with Rafael, Israel's weapon systems development authority, in {{the introduction of the}} Tadmit electro-optical fire-and-forget guided bomb, {{a modified version of the}} AGM-62 Walleye II. At the same time, the Phantom's air-to-air role was diminished with the introduction into service of the F-15 Eagle and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The squadron was, nonetheless, the first IAF squadron to introduce Rafael's Python 3 into service in March 1977. Air-to-air training continued and on December 29, 1977, during combat against a pair of F-15s, two squadron aircraft collided. Squadron leader Avsha Friedman and navigator Avihu Ikar were killed. The remains of their aircraft, Kurnass 305, stand as a memorial to the two pilots on the Acre-Carmiel road. On January 20, 1981, the squadron lost another pilot in similar circumstances, when Kurnass 222 collided with F-16 222. Squadron leader Eliezer Adar ejected, but Dani Weiss was killed, as was the F-16 pilot, Uri Ben-Amitai.|$|E
