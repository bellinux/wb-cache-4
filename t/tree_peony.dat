50|$|In 1938, Bill met Arthur P. Saunders, a {{chemistry}} professor and prominent American hybridizer of the <b>tree</b> <b>peony.</b> He introduced over 300 herbaceous peony varieties and over 70 varieties of <b>tree</b> <b>peony</b> in his lifetime, most notably creating distinctive yellow cultivars. Bill Gratwick worked with Saunders {{for a little}} over a decade, and imported over 100 select Japanese <b>tree</b> <b>peony</b> plants and 500 seeds from the Chugai Monastery in Japan to complement the Saunders collections. Bill carried on Saunders' work after Saunders' death in 1953, and Gratwick eventually introduced twelve of his own cultivars.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tree</b> <b>peonies</b> are {{important}} ornamental plants worldwide, but growing {{them can be}} frustrating due to their short and concentrated flowering period. Certain cultivars exhibit a reblooming trait that provides a valuable alternative for extending the flowering period. However, the genetic control of reblooming in <b>tree</b> <b>peonies</b> is not well understood. In this study, we compared the molecular properties and morphology of reblooming and non-reblooming <b>tree</b> <b>peonies</b> during the floral initiation and developmental processes. Using transcriptome sequencing technology, we generated 59, 275 and 63, 962 unigenes with a mean size of 698 bp and 699 bp from {{the two types of}} <b>tree</b> <b>peonies,</b> respectively, and identified eight differentially expressed genes that are involved in the floral pathways of Arabidopsis thaliana. These differentially regulated genes were verified through a detailed analysis of their expression pattern during the floral process by real time RT-PCR. From this combined analysis, we identified four genes, PsFT, PsVIN 3, PsCO and PsGA 20 OX, which likely play important roles in the regulation of the reblooming process in <b>tree</b> <b>peonies.</b> These data constitute a valuable resource for the discovery of genes involved in flowering time and insights into the molecular mechanism of flowering to further accelerate the breeding of <b>tree</b> <b>peonies</b> and other perennial woody plants...|$|R

50|$|Paeonia suffruticosa {{belongs to}} the peony family. The most {{distinctive}} feature is that Paeonia suffruticosa is a bush or a <b>tree,</b> whereas most <b>peonies</b> are herbaceous.

In comparison, Paeonia suffruticosa, as a tree, survives longer {{than the rest of}} the peonies. The woody stems of <b>tree</b> <b>peonies</b> allow the plant to survive in winter.
