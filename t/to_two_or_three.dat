5|$|The {{building}} {{had been planned}} since 1968 as a vision of Yogiji Maharaj. Yogiji Maharaj, the spiritual head of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha at the time, expressed his desire for wanting a grand temple built {{on the banks of}} the Yamuna river <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> devotee families of Swaminarayan that resided in New Delhi at the time. Attempts were made to start the project, however little progress was made. In 1971, Yogiji Maharaj died.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} musical innovation of the concerto delle donne was the multiplication of the ornamented upper voices, {{from one}} voice singing diminutions above an instrumental accompaniment <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> voices singing varying diminutions at once. This practice, which listeners found remarkable, was imitated by many composers, including Carlo Gesualdo, Luca Marenzio and Claudio Monteverdi.|$|E
5|$|Ongoing {{efforts are}} being made by the {{government}} at various levels (especially of Campania) to reduce the population living in the red zone, by demolishing illegally constructed buildings, establishing a national park around the whole volcano to prevent the future construction of buildings and by offering sufficient financial incentives to people for moving away. One of the underlying goals {{is to reduce the}} time needed to evacuate the area, over the next 20 or 30years, <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> days.|$|E

5|$|The {{concentration}} of magnesium {{in the waters}} of Buffalo Creek ranges from nearly 0 to almost 15 milligrams per liter. The concentration is close to 0 for the first third of the creek's course, but then rises <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> milligrams per liter. The magnesium concentration reaches its peak around halfway between the source and the mouth, then steadily declines to slightly under ten milligrams per liter at the mouth. However, one of Buffalo Creek's tributaries has a magnesium {{concentration of}} nearly 35 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|When {{radially}} broaching workpieces {{that require}} a deep cut per tooth, such as forgings or castings, a rotor-cut or jump-cut design can be used; these broaches are also known as free egress or nibbling broaches. In this design the RPT is designated <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> rows of teeth. For the broach to work the first tooth of that cluster has a wide notch, or undercut, {{and then the next}} tooth has a smaller notch (in a three tooth design) and the final tooth has no notch. This allows for a deep cut while keeping stresses, forces, and power requirements low.|$|E
5|$|Edward Alston first {{described}} Oryzomys couesi in 1877, using three specimens from Mexico and Guatemala. He named the animal Hesperomys couesi, {{placing it in}} the now-defunct genus Hesperomys, and noted similarities to the marsh rice rat (then called Hesperomys palustris) and two species now placed in Tylomys. The specific name, couesi, honors American naturalist Elliott Coues, who had done much work on North American rodents. In 1893, Oldfield Thomas wrote that the species, by then placed in the genus Oryzomys as Oryzomys couesi, had caused much confusion about its identity, because the three specimens (one from Cobán, Guatemala, and two from Mexico) used by Alston in fact belonged <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> different species. He restricted the name couesi to the animal from Guatemala, and introduced the new name Oryzomys fulgens {{for one of the}} Mexican animals. Several other related species were described from the early 1890s onwards and in 1901 Clinton Hart Merriam united many of those into a palustris-mexicanus group of species, which also included the marsh rice rat.|$|E

5|$|The {{gestation}} period varies within lemurs, ranging from 9 weeks in mouse lemurs and 9–10weeks in dwarf lemurs to 18–24weeks in other lemurs. The smaller, nocturnal lemurs, such as mouse lemurs, giant mouse lemurs, and dwarf lemurs, usually {{give birth to}} more than one infant, whereas the larger, nocturnal lemurs, such as fork-marked lemurs, sportive lemurs, and the aye-aye usually have one offspring. Dwarf and mouse lemurs have up to four offspring, but both average only two. Ruffed lemurs are the only large, diurnal lemurs to consistently give birth <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> offspring. All other lemurs have single births. Multiple births in lemurs are normally fraternal, and are known to occur in every five to six births in species such as the ring-tailed lemur and some Eulemur.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{never seen}} professionally today, {{it is most}} often {{encountered}} in local cricket clubs, {{in which there are}} a number of knockout rounds leading to a final. The exact rules can vary according to local practice: for example, a player might be deducted runs for an out rather than ending his or her innings. An innings typically is limited <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> overs. When single wicket was popular in the 18th century, however, there was no overs limitation, and a player's innings ended only on his dismissal.|$|E
25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E

25|$|During {{the thirteenth}} century, a new rhythm system called mensural {{notation}} {{grew out of}} an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called rhythmic modes, which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise Ars cantus mensurabilis ("The art of measured chant") by Franco of Cologne (c. 1280). Mensural notation used different note shapes to specify different durations, allowing scribes to capture rhythms which varied instead of repeating the same fixed pattern; it is a proportional notation, {{in the sense that}} each note value is equal <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> times the shorter value, or half or a third of the longer value. This same notation, transformed through various extensions and improvements during the Renaissance, forms the basis for rhythmic notation in European classical music today.|$|E
25|$|The police {{returned}} to the area but were unable to re-enter and were forced to retreat several times with heavy losses. That evening, they called upon Captain Isaiah Rynders to use his influence to stop the battle. Rynders, the political boss of the Sixth Ward, was long associated with the underworld, and {{it was thought that}} he could force them to stop. He agreed, and upon his arrival between 6:00–7:00p.m., he addressed the gangsters from the barricades. Although he tried to reason with them by telling them the futility of fighting, they refused to listen, and Rynders was forced to escape into the company of his henchmen, when the mob responded by throwing rocks at him. He then traveled to the Metropolitan Police Headquarters where he advised Draper to call in the military. Meanwhile, fires had been set <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> houses while residents remained under siege by looters and thugs.|$|E
25|$|Local {{government}} in the Ming and Qing dynasties accumulated responsibilities without increased resources. As the population grew, the number of counties remained roughly the same, with populations that could grow to perhaps 200,000. Ming rulers tightened the rule of avoidance which prevented magistrates from serving in their home districts, where it was justifiably feared that they would favor their friends and families, and the term of office was generally limited <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> years. These rules ran the danger of posting magistrates to unfamiliar areas where they could not speak the local dialect and could not accumulate knowledge of local circumstances. The Qing government continued the Ming practice of requiring the magistrate to pay his subordinates from local taxes, not central government revenue; clerks, runners, jailers and such collected “informal fees” from the people. Confucian ideals also held that the state should {{stay out of the}} lives of the common people, who were to carry out public security functions on their own. The village head was responsible for tax collection, and the magistrate held him personally responsible for any shortfall.|$|E
