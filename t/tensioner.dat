Three prototypes were completed; two were delivered in September 1944, but the third was retained at the factory. Development, however, did not proceed any further. Yet another new version of the Sd.Kfz. 10 was proposed in the Emergency Development Program (Entwicklungs-Notprogramm) of 20 February 1945 with armored engine and driver's compartments that was to have had its development completed in June 1945.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Reitwagen {{was destroyed}} in the Cannstatt Fire that razed the Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft Seelberg-Cannstatt plant in 1903, but several replicas exist in collections at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, the Deutsches Museum in Munich, the Honda Collection Hall at the Twin Ring Motegi facility in Japan, the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in Ohio, and in Melbourne, Australia. The Deutsches Museum lent their replica to the Guggenheim Las Vegas The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition in 2001. The replicas vary as to which version they follow.

The air-cooled engine (producing just [...] was replaced by a water-cooled, six-cylinder Maybach NL 38 TR, developing , and the gearbox was changed to a more reliable model. The larger engine required the extension of the vehicle's chassis by 40cm (16in), and this allowed the improvement of the tank's suspension, adding another bogie wheel and raising the <b>tensioner.</b> The tank's weight increased by 0.4tons. Production of the Ausf.B began in August 1936 and finished in summer 1937 after 399 had been built in two series (5a-6a/LaS). Further 159 were built as command tanks in two series, 295 chassis were built as turretless training tanks. 147 more training tanks were built as convertible chassis with hardened armour with option to upgrade them to full combat status by adding superstructure and turret.|$|E

500|$|The new {{prototype}} {{was much}} closer to what Captain Verdeja had originally planned. The chassis was enlarged, and the engine {{was moved to the}} left side of the front compartment of the hull. The volume of the fuel tanks and the thickness of the armor was also increased, while the height of the turret was decreased by sloping the turret's sides. [...] One of the most unusual— at the time— developments for the tank were the tracks, designed to eliminate the possibility of having them slide off when the tank was moving. The tank had a sprocket to the front of the hull, on each side, and a <b>tensioner</b> to the rear. The tracks were guided by four return rollers and four roadwheels. [...] The tracks had previously been tested on the original prototype; they were designed to fit around the roadwheel, and consequently lock themselves into place, avoiding the possibility of slipping off. [...] The construction of the prototype was postponed until May 1940, due to a shortage of funds, and the tank was finally delivered to the proving grounds of Carabanchel for testing. [...] The prototype was denominated the Verdeja1, and competed against a T-26B in a number of different tests. Ultimately, the Verdeja scored a total of 243 points, as compared to 205 scored by the T-26. [...] The testing resulted in a number of modifications, including higher suspension to allow climbing over taller obstacles, the increase in armor thickness, increase of the body width and the creation of an empty space at the rear, to allow for the future installation of a communications radio. [...] After two months work, the Verdeja1 was returned for testing and this time scored a total of 261.98 points. [...] Although the success of this prototype persuaded the Spanish government to issue an order for the construction of 1,000 tanks, ultimately lack of incentives to develop the relevant industrial infrastructure; the poor economic situation after the Spanish Civil War and absence of foreign clients, soon caused the production program to collapse.|$|E

The crankcase breather system had reed valves added to control pressure waves in the intake airbox, a way of avoiding power loss.|$|E
2500|$|The XK8 was {{launched}} in 1996 to replace the XJ-S. [...] Two body styles were produced - a coupé and a convertible.

[...] The XKR featured 370 supercharged horsepower, a subtle rear spoiler, wire mesh front grille, and red exterior emblems. [...] The XKR's motor was made in England, the ignition system was from NGK in Japan, the transmission was a Mercedes-Benz 722.6, the lighting system was by Valeo in France, and the supercharger was made by Eaton in the USA. [...] So it was truly a world car. [...] The 2000-2002 XKR's had the 4.0 engine which featured a plastic timing chain <b>tensioner</b> and plastic finned water pump.

2500|$|The Series II Land Rover was a sales success, {{but there}} was still room for improvements. In 1962 the {{slightly}} altered Series IIA was launched. As well as some suspension and steering system changes, the biggest update was an improved diesel engine. This shared many parts with its petrol-fuelled sibling, including the block, valve gear, cooling systems and lubrication systems. A forged crankshaft was used for added strength, and different pistons were needed. The cylinder head used the same basic casting, but was very different internally, being in essence an updated version of that used on the original 2-litre engine, to which the new diesel bore a strong external resemblance. Like the 2.25-litre petrol, the 2.25-litre diesel was a dry-liner design. It was built on the same production line as the petrol engine and the flexibility of the basic design was much in evidence- for example, where the diesel engines had their fuel injector pumps, the petrol engine had its distributor fitted. Although it offered a modest improvement in power and a useful jump in torque, the main benefit of the new diesel engine was that it was much quieter and more efficient than the older unit. It also proved to be much more reliable in service. Like the petrol engine, the diesel was upgraded to a 5-bearing crankshaft in 1980. The engine was fitted to the Austin FX4 Black Cab between 1982 and 1985. FX4s fitted with the engine were designated 'FX4R' ('R' for 'Rover'). In this application the engine gained a reputation for very short service life and unreliability. This was caused by the significantly greater times spent at idle speed in the Black Cab than in the Land Rover. Solihull engineers had warned Carbodies, builders of the FX4R that this would cause problems as at idle speed the engine's oil pressure dropped, causing the automatic <b>tensioner</b> unit for the timing chain to not operate fully. At the high number of hours spent at idle speed (taxi drivers tended to leave the engines idling for long period whilst waiting for passengers or when off-duty as well as all the time spent in stationary traffic in London) this caused the timing chains to stretch, causing incorrect fuel injection timing which greatly reduced engine life. [...] The 10J engine was also adapted into a marine engine by Mercury of the USA and sold under the Mercruiser 165 name.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground: During total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA), femoral rotation can {{be adjusted}} either in relation to bony landmarks or by tensioning the ligaments with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to compare femoral rotations achieved using various ligament-tensioning devices. The secondary objective was to compare these femoral rotations to that indicated by the transepicondylar axis (TEA). Material and methods: We performed 13 posterior-stabilised TKA procedures using HiFit (Ceraver (R)) on cadaver knees. Before performing the posterior condyle cut, we used an original method to measure the femoral rotation induced by five different ligament-tensioning devices (2 with a ratchet mechanism, 1 with screws, 1 force-sensing device, and 1 with spacer blocks) and the central tibio-femoral distance(CTFD). Results: Both ratchet <b>tensioners</b> provided significantly greater mean external rotation values (P= 0. 002), of 4. 94 degrees and 4. 46 degrees, respectively, compared to the force-sensing and spacer <b>tensioners.</b> Significant differences were found across devices for CTFD, with a mean difference of about 2 mm between the ratchet and screwtensioners versus the force-sensing and spacer <b>tensioners.</b> The mean differences in rotations obtained using the <b>tensioners</b> versus the TEA were close to 0 degrees but with standard deviations greater than 4 degrees. Conclusion: Femoral rotation was dependent on the distraction force applied to the joint. <b>Tensioners</b> that did not measure the distraction force were associated with greater distraction force and external rotation values. The TEA criterion did not reliably indicate good ligament balance. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS...|$|R
