5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs used Swiss Pilatus P-2 army {{training}} planes {{standing in}} for Messerschmitt Bf-109s. He built a device {{based on an}} internal combustion engine to simulate gunfire, which was safer and less expensive than firing blanks. Baking soda was applied to Connery to create Henry's bullet wound. Vinegar was applied to create the foaming effect as <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Grail washes it away.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the inner ward contain {{extensive}} first floor passageways, similar to those at Caernarfon Castle. These were intended to allow members of the castle to move between the towers, accessing the guardrooms, sleeping chambers and the castle latrines. The latrines were designed to be drained by a special system using <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> moat, but the system {{does not appear to}} have worked well in practice. The six towers were intended to be three storeys high and contained fireplaces. The castle chapel was built into one of the towers and would have been used by the king and his family, rather than the wider garrison.|$|E

5|$|Within a few days, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{identified}} primary {{concerns for}} the small island, including fixing the water supply, distributing water, clearing roads, and fixing damaged shelters. On the island, the water supply was rapidly diminishing; more than 80% of the islanders were without clean water, and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> treatment plant needed to be boiled for extended periods of time. Health issues included dehydration, sickness, and gastrointestinal problems. Without running water, several people bathed in the oil-contaminated harbor where many boats sunk, which caused skin irritations.|$|E
5|$|Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle {{relates to}} the nine {{phenomena}} that occurred when the image was consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed. These nine phenomena were: holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels; <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tank that was used for washing the Buddha's head would retain its quality throughout the year; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped the image in the evenings; the rays faded {{in the presence of}} non-believers; the space in the temple would automatically accommodate any number of devotees; the leaves of trees would tilt {{in the direction of the}} Buddha image; birds would not fly over the temple; and the stone guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days, houses were wooden boards fronted by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a boardwalk. Most {{of the streets}} were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses {{dragging}} V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets. In {{the center of town}} was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a deep well. St. Bernard dogs helped carry <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.|$|E

5|$|Near its mouth, the River Rother {{no longer}} follows its ancient course, {{as it once}} flowed across Romney Marsh and joined the sea at Dungeness. It is widely {{asserted}} that in 1287 a hurricane, known as the Great Storm, caused large quantities of shingle and mud to be deposited on the port of Romney and {{the mouth of the}} river. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> river created a new channel, joining the River Brede and the River Tillingham near Rye, where the combined rivers flow into the sea. However, Tatton-Brown has argued that patterns of occupation on Romney Marsh suggest that the change of route took place at least a century before that date. Rye became part of the Cinque Ports in the thirteenth century, and although it is situated some distance from the sea, its harbour is still visited by commercial shipping and has a fleet of fishing boats.|$|E
5|$|The docks {{occupy the}} former sound between Barry Island and the mainland. The {{contractors}} built dams to connect {{each end of}} the island to the mainland, drained or pumped <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> site and excavated it. They used the material to level the area round the docks and for the core of breakwaters to protect the entrance. The works included a basin with gates at each end which served as a lock between the sea entrance and the docks, the dock walls and quays, coal loading equipment and railways to deliver coal from the mines to the docks. A second dock and second entrance lock were added in 1898. Barry Dock Offices were built in 1897-1900 by the architect Arthur E. Bell.|$|E
5|$|Trinity River Division is {{the second}} large CVP {{department}} for the northern Sacramento Valley. The {{primary purpose of the}} division is to divert water from the Trinity River into the Sacramento River drainage downstream of Shasta Dam in order to provide more flow in the Sacramento River and generating peaking power in the process. Trinity Dam forms Trinity Lake, the second largest CVP water-storage reservoir, with just over half the capacity of Shasta and a generating capacity of 140 MW. Lewiston Dam, downstream of Trinity Dam, diverts water into the Clear Creek Tunnel, which travels to empty into a third reservoir, Whiskeytown Lake on Clear Creek, a tributary of the Sacramento River, generating 154 MW of power in the process. Whiskeytown Lake (formed by Clair. A Hill Whiskeytown Dam) in turn provides water to the Spring Creek Tunnel, which travels into the lowermost extreme of Spring Creek, a stream that flows into Keswick Reservoir, generating another 180 MW of electricity. From there <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Trinity River empties into Keswick Reservoir and the Sacramento River. In 1963, the Spring Creek Debris Dam was constructed just upstream of the outlet of the Spring Creek Tunnel, to prevent acid mine drainage from the Iron Mountain Mine from continuing downstream and contaminating the river.|$|E
