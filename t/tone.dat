5|$|Southern Min dialects undergo {{considerable}} <b>tone</b> sandhi, i.e. {{changes to}} the <b>tone</b> depending on {{the position of the}} syllable in any given sentence or utterance. However, like pinyin for Mandarin Chinese, POJ always marks the citation <b>tone</b> (i.e. the original, pre-sandhi <b>tone)</b> rather than the <b>tone</b> which is actually spoken. This means that when reading aloud the reader must adjust the <b>tone</b> markings on the page to account for sandhi. Some textbooks for learners of Southern Min mark both the citation <b>tone</b> and the sandhi <b>tone</b> to assist the learner.|$|E
5|$|Before {{and during}} their marriage, Crawford worked to promote Tone's Hollywood career, but <b>Tone</b> was {{ultimately}} {{not interested in}} being a movie star and Crawford eventually wearied of the effort. After <b>Tone</b> reportedly began drinking and becoming physically abusive, she filed for divorce, which was granted in 1939. Crawford and <b>Tone</b> much later rekindled their friendship and <b>Tone</b> even proposed in 1964 that they remarry. When he died in 1968, Crawford arranged {{for him to be}} cremated and his ashes scattered at Muskoka Lakes, Canada.|$|E

50|$|Falling <b>tones</b> tend to fall {{further than}} rising <b>tones</b> rise; high-low <b>tones</b> are common, whereas low-high <b>tones</b> are quite rare. A {{language}} with contour <b>tones</b> will also generally {{have as many}} or more falling <b>tones</b> than rising <b>tones.</b> However, exceptions are not unheard of; Mpi, for example, has three level and three rising <b>tones,</b> but no falling <b>tones.</b>|$|R

5|$|Around 1900, Dr. Richard H. Stein, a Berlin musicologist, made a quarter-tone clarinet, {{which was}} soon abandoned. Years later, another German, Fritz Schüller of Markneukirchen, built a quarter <b>tone</b> clarinet, with two {{parallel}} bores of slightly different lengths whose <b>tone</b> holes are operated {{using the same}} keywork and a valve to switch from one bore to the other.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1826, the Canal Company had {{insufficient}} funds {{to complete the}} work, and a special meeting authorised the taking out of a mortgage to cover the £15,000 deficit. The canal was an obvious competitor to the River <b>Tone</b> Navigation, which was managed by the Conservators of the River <b>Tone,</b> a legal body created for that purpose by Act of Parliament in 1699. There was animosity between the Company and the Conservators, with the Company maintaining {{that they had a}} right to use the <b>Tone</b> to reach the centre of Taunton, and the Conservators maintaining that they did not. The canal was scheduled to be opened on 1 January 1827, but the opening was delayed until 3 January, as the connection to the River <b>Tone</b> was not made until 2 January. The opening celebrations were hampered by snow and bitter cold weather.|$|E
30|$|As a {{predefined}} parameter, we set α% of all <b>tones</b> to be dynamic <b>tones.</b> First, in {{a training}} phase at system start-up, a dynamic allocation is obtained, as represented in Figure 2.

5000|$|John Chalmers, in his [...] "English and Cantonese pocket-dictionary" [...] (1859) {{simplified}} the marking of <b>tones</b> {{using the}} acute accent to mark [...] "rising" [...] <b>tones</b> and the grave to mark [...] "going" [...] <b>tones</b> and no diacritic for [...] "even" [...] <b>tones</b> and marking upper register <b>tones</b> by italics (or underlining in handwritten work). [...] "Entering" [...] <b>tones</b> could be distinguished by their consonantal ending. Nicholas Belfeld Dennys used Chalmers romanization in his primer. This {{method of marking}} <b>tones</b> was adopted in the Yale romanization (with low register <b>tones</b> marked with an 'h'). A new romanization {{was developed in the}} first decade of the twentieth century which eliminated the diacritics on vowels by distinguishing vowel quality by spelling differences (e.g. a/aa, o/oh). Diacritics were used only for marking <b>tones.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{basically}} 9 <b>tones</b> in Cantonese. <b>Tones</b> {{play an important}} role in distinguishing meanings. <b>Tones</b> also form melodies in poem and prose composition.|$|R
5|$|Clarinets {{were soon}} {{accepted}} into orchestras. Later models had a mellower <b>tone</b> than the originals. Mozart (d. 1791) liked {{the sound of}} the clarinet (he considered its <b>tone</b> the closest in quality to the human voice) and wrote numerous pieces for the instrument., and by the time of Beethoven (c. 1800–1820), the clarinet was a standard fixture in the orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{subsequent}} vowel loss many Mayan languages now show complex consonant clusters at {{both ends}} of syllables. Following the reconstruction of Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the Proto-Mayan language had the following sounds. It has been suggested that proto-Mayan was a tonal language, {{based on the fact that}} four different contemporary Mayan languages have <b>tone</b> (Yucatec, Uspantek, San Bartolo Tzotzil and Mocho'), but since these languages each can be shown to have innovated <b>tone</b> in different ways, Campbell considers this unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the {{flared end}} {{is known as}} the bell. Contrary to popular belief, the bell does not amplify the sound; rather, it {{improves}} the uniformity of the instrument's <b>tone</b> for the lowest notes in each register. For the other notes the sound is produced almost entirely at the <b>tone</b> holes and the bell is irrelevant. On basset horns and larger clarinets, the bell curves up and forward and is usually made of metal.|$|E

5|$|Following her divorce, she {{was again}} teamed with Clark Gable, along with Franchot <b>Tone</b> and Fred Astaire, {{in the hit}} Dancing Lady (1933), in which she {{received}} top billing. She next played the title role in Sadie McKee (1934) opposite <b>Tone</b> and Gene Raymond. She was paired with Gable {{for the fifth time}} in Chained (1934) and for the sixth time in Forsaking All Others (1934). Crawford's films of this era were some of the most-popular and highest-grossing films of the mid-1930s.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Crawford married Franchot <b>Tone,</b> a stage actor from New York {{who planned}} to use his film {{earnings}} to finance his theatre group. The couple built a small theatre at Crawford's Brentwood home and put on productions of classic plays for select groups of friends. <b>Tone</b> and Crawford had first appeared together in Today We Live (1933) but Crawford was hesitant about entering into another romance so soon after her split from Fairbanks.|$|E
5|$|In most Western music, <b>tone</b> {{clusters}} tend to {{be heard}} as dissonant. Clusters may be performed with almost any individual instrument on which three or more notes can be played simultaneously, {{as well as by}} most groups of instruments or voices. Keyboard instruments are particularly suited to the performance of <b>tone</b> clusters because it is relatively easy to play multiple notes in unison on them.|$|E
50|$|Several Kam-Sui {{languages}} of southern China have nine contrastive <b>tones,</b> including contour <b>tones.</b> For example, the Kam language has 9 tones: 3 more-or-less fixed <b>tones</b> (high, mid and low); 4 unidirectional <b>tones</b> ({{high and low}} rising, high and low falling); and 2 bidirectional <b>tones</b> (dipping and peaking). This assumes that checked syllables are not counted as having additional <b>tones,</b> as they traditionally are in China. For example, in the traditional reckoning, the Kam language has 15 <b>tones,</b> but 6 occur only in syllables closed with /p/, /t/ or /k/, and the other 9 occur only in syllables not ending {{in one of these}} sounds.|$|R
5000|$|One {{family member}} stands behind a console with five buttons, facing the panels, and must {{replicate}} four sequences. The first three award 10% (three <b>tones),</b> 25% (five <b>tones),</b> and 50% (seven <b>tones)</b> of the family's total, respectively, {{and the fourth}} (nine <b>tones)</b> awards the entire jackpot.|$|R
5000|$|Two sets of <b>tones</b> {{are used}} for the [...] "Magnificat", the canticle of Vespers, and the [...] "Benedictus", the canticle of Lauds: simple <b>tones,</b> which {{are very close to}} the {{standard}} psalm <b>tones,</b> and solemn <b>tones,</b> which are more ornate and used on the more important feasts.|$|R
5|$|In <b>tone</b> clusters, {{the notes}} are sounded fully and in unison, {{distinguishing}} them from ornamented figures involving acciaccaturas and the like. Their effect {{also tends to}} be different: where ornamentation is used {{to draw attention to}} the harmony or the relationship between harmony and melody, <b>tone</b> clusters are for the most part employed as independent sounds. While, by definition, the notes that form a cluster must sound at the same time, there is no requirement that they must all begin sounding at the same moment. For example, in R. Murray Schafer's choral Epitaph for Moonlight (1968), a <b>tone</b> cluster is constructed by dividing each choir section (soprano/alto/tenor/bass) into four parts. Each of the sixteen parts enters separately, humming a note one semitone lower than the note hummed by the previous part, until all sixteen are contributing to the cluster.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the tonal {{lowering}} seen in this particular example is related to the low <b>tone</b> nasal prefix found in future tense constructions in some other Senufo languages. In fact, Supyire shows a similar phenomenon in future tense constructions with a direct object (in other future tense constructions, a low <b>tone</b> nasal is found).|$|E
5|$|Lilias Eveline Armstrong (29 September 1882– 9 December 1937) was an English phonetician. She {{worked at}} University College London, where she {{attained}} {{the rank of}} reader.
