5|$|A {{visit by}} Dahlia Brinkley, the only Springfield Elementary {{graduate}} ever to enter an Ivy League college, gives Lisa a severe inferiority complex {{because she is}} involved in very few extracurricular activities. When Ned Flanders resigns as coach of Bart's Little League team, the Springfield Isotots, Lisa seizes the chance to extend her résumé and takes the position. Since she knows nothing about baseball, she seeks advice from the patrons of Moe's Tavern, who direct her to Professor Frink and his scientific colleagues. She learns about sabermetrics from them and uses this science to organize the Isotots' strategy; as a result, their record quickly improves and they rise in the league standings. However, Bart eventually rebels against her management, saying that she has taken all <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the game, and hits a home run despite her orders to let the pitcher walk him. The Isotots win the game, but Lisa throws Bart off the team for his insubordination.|$|E
500|$|... "MoneyBart" [...] (also {{referred}} to as [...] "MoneyBART") is the third episode of The Simpsons twenty-second season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 10, 2010. In this episode, Lisa coaches Bart's Little League baseball team to a record winning streak by using her book smarts in statistics and probability. However, when Bart questions Lisa’s coaching tactics and accuses her of taking <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> baseball, Lisa benches him from the championship game.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{himself as}} [...] "sort of a foodie", Selman {{has said that}} food is {{constantly}} on his mind and that he particularly likes reading food critic Jonathan Gold's reviews in LA Weekly. He told LA Weeklys Squid Ink food blog that he likes foodies, despite making fun of them in [...] "The Food Wife". He commented that on the show, he has often [...] "taken something that I love, found the one little weird, bad thing about it and harped on that", giving foodies as an example and writing: [...] "You can make fun of them for being pretentious or snobby or taking <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> eating. That you'd rather photograph something than taste it is a funny nuance of the phenomenon. That it's more about sticking your flag in something than actually enjoying it. We kind of make fun of foodies, but in real life we actually love them." ...|$|E

60|$|But at {{last the}} pig grew tired <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun,</b> bolted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate, and ran across the yard to his own place. Mrs. Hayden {{followed}} slowly and Harrington walked beside her.|$|R
60|$|This {{reasonable}} objection in no wise {{influenced the}} old man's son. He overruled the good arguments, and then hinted at the cowboys' lack <b>of</b> nerve. <b>The</b> <b>fun</b> faded <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their faces. Lem, in fact, grew red.|$|R
500|$|The {{critical}} {{reception of}} the character has been generally negative. Robert A. George of the New York Post has written that Glee has: [...] "the most unpleasant pack of female characters of any show in recent memory", and deemed Terri the [...] "biggest culprit". George called Terri's hysterical pregnancy [...] "Freudian" [...] and wrote: [...] "The Terri-Quinn plot sends {{the message that the}} devious gender will use every trick to lure and trap its mate — including lying about pregnancy." [...] Varietys Brian Lowry commented: [...] "Perhaps to foster a rooting interest (or at least sympathy) for a Will-Emma pairing, [...] (Jessalyn Gilsig) is initially presented as a ditsy shrew." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan has called Terri [...] "the worst thing about Glee", and opined: [...] "As written by Murphy and played by Gilsig, the character is screechy, unfunny and deeply unpleasant. It's as if Ryan didn't trust that the audience would get behind Will and the saga of his ragtag glee club and so saw fit to give the teacher the shrewish, nagging wife from hell." [...] Ryan later deemed Terri the [...] "one big flaw in Glee, commenting that she: [...] "manages to drain all <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Glee every time she appears. Not only is this shrill character intensely annoying, but she makes you wonder whether Will has brain damage. What other explanation could there be for his ending up with this materialistic harpy?". Furthermore, Terri was included in TV Guide list of The Most Loathed TV Characters.|$|E
500|$|Brian Lowry for Variety, however, {{criticized the}} episode. He wrote that Lynch's {{performance}} was [...] "fitfully funny but usually just plain annoying", calling the pregnancy subplot [...] "credulity-straining". Lowry praised Colfer and Michele, however {{stated that the}} show's talent was squandered by its [...] "jokey, cartoonish, wildly uneven tone". He deemed the show a [...] "one-hit wonder", writing that: [...] "the musical numbersgenerally less infectious and buoyant than the first time outcan’t compensate for overly broad characterizations and absurdly soapy situations." [...] Robert Bianco for USA Today gave a mixed review, commenting: [...] "It {{would be better if}} Glee had more control and fewer abrupt tonal shifts, but that's not the Glee we're getting — and maybe it wouldn't be Glee at all. It's not perfect, but in a sea of procedural conformity, Glee is its own weird, often enchanting little island escape." [...] While Hank Stuever for The Washington Post praised the show's inclusion of adult storylines alongside teenage drama, Robert Lloyd for the Los Angeles Times felt that the adult characters [...] "tend more to caricature than character", writing of Sue that: [...] "the writing flattens her toward a single note. She's funny from line to line, but there is little to her besides tin-pot contrariness." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan commented similarly: [...] "there's one big flaw in Glee [...] and it may be a harbinger of bad things to come. Will's wife, Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), manages to drain all <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Glee every time she appears." [...] Ryan received the younger cast more positively, stating that there were [...] "no weak links", and praising Colfer and Michele in particular.|$|E
2500|$|The 1973 season saw the Tigers drop {{to third}} place in the division, with an 85-77 record. Joe Coleman posted another 23 wins, but the other Tiger {{starters}} had subpar seasons. Willie Horton hit [...]316, but injuries limited him to just 111 games. Jim Northrup posted the best batting average of his career (.307) but was inexplicably limited to part-time duty (119 games played), which Northrup attributed to an ongoing feud with Billy Martin that had actually started in the 1972 ALCS. Northrup even proclaimed to the press that Martin [...] "took <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the game." [...] Martin did not survive the 1973 season as manager. He was fired that September after ordering his pitchers to throw spitballs (and telling the press that he did so) in protest of opposing Cleveland Indians pitcher Gaylord Perry, whom Martin was convinced was doing the same. Base coach Joe Schultz served as interim manager for the final 28 games of the season.|$|E

5000|$|Even many of {{the critics}} who enjoyed the first film were {{disappointed}} with the sequel. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film one star and said it [...] "leeches <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> clean <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first Hoodwinked and Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post wrote that, [...] "while the first film was lifted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> mediocrity by an utterly delightful storyline...the sequel is a flat, plodding and largely mirthless affair." ...|$|R

2500|$|Fertility Hollis : A {{friend of}} Tender's. [...] She meets him at her dead brother Trevor's crypt. At first, Fertility {{says she is}} repulsed by him, but as the novel {{progresses}} the two grow close. [...] "Fertility" [...] is {{not her real name}} but a pseudonym she uses for her job, which is acting as a surrogate mother for couples who cannot conceive. Her job is fraudulent in that she is actually sterile and has never managed to carry a child for a client. Fertility has the psychic ability to predict the future; she knows when, where, how, and to whom everything is going to happen, which takes all <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> life for her. She strikes up a friendship with Tender and helps him throughout the novel because she believes he is the only person who can surprise her. It is Fertility who leads Tender to hijack the plane. She also tells him that there is a way for him to [...] "survive", but her meaning is ambiguous.|$|E
2500|$|... {{is one of}} Yusei's best friends. His {{parents died}} when he was little, and he was alone until Duel Monsters gave him friends and taught him how to read. He was given the {{nickname}} Crow by some other young duelists, since his first card was a Blackwing. He passes his knowledge on to a group of children he looks after, and he steals to provide for them. He later becomes a member of the Enforcers (Team Satisfaction in the Japanese version) with Yusei, Jack, and Kalin, but he quits due to Kalin taking <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> dueling. His custom Duel Runner, Blackbird, has a built-in Flying Formation used to cross large gaps and can also fire hooks to change direction. After facing Goodwin alongside Yusei and Jack, Crow inherits Yusei's Tail Birthmark, becoming a Signer. He uses a Blackwing deck that can quickly summon monsters (a.k.a. [...] "swarming") and use their abilities to win a duel, and his main Synchro Monsters are Blackwing Armed Wing, Blackwing - Silverwind the Ascendant, and Blackwing Armor Master. He later obtains his own Signer Dragon, Black-Winged Dragon. At the end of the series, he becomes part of the police force in New Domino City. He then leaves New Domino City to participate in Duel Circuits.|$|E

6000|$|We {{had been}} having a splendid game of Blind-Man's Buff. That is, it had been splendid at first; but later <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it because we found that Peter was, of malice prepense, {{allowing}} himself to be caught too easily, in order {{that he might have}} the pleasure of catching Felicity--which he never failed to do, no matter how tightly his eyes were bound. What remarkable goose said that love is blind? Love can see through five folds of closely-woven muffler with ease! ...|$|R
60|$|But {{she did not}} sink. The liveliness and <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her, and {{her face}} grew hard and her manner quiet. But she was not quiet within. She rebelled against the {{unfairness}} with which she was treated. No matter what the newspapers knew or did not know, they should have known, and should have remembered, that she had saved her uncle's life. If they had known more {{they would have been}} just and kind enough no doubt, but they ought to have been just and kind without knowing more.|$|R

60|$|But Rollin made no reply. He was {{far from}} jesting, poor fellow, at that moment. The thought of his old mother and grandfather, and fears as to their fate, weighed heavily on his heart, and took all <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|The {{house was}} in a roaring humour now, and ready to get all <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the {{occasion}} that might be in it. Several Nineteeners, looking pale and distressed, got {{up and began to}} work their way towards the aisles, but a score of shouts went up: ...|$|E

60|$|Being {{misunderstood}} and, to all outward {{appearances of}} sentiment and affection, unloved had {{not in any}} way embittered Abigail's remarkably joyous temperament.

2500|$|Young {{was awarded}} the NFL Rookie of the Year honors for 2006. In spite of this, Young {{considered}} ending his career. In an article published by NFL.com Young {{was quoted as saying}} he thought about retiring from professional football after his first season stating [...] "I really thought long and hard about it. There was so much going on with my family. It was crazy being an NFL quarterback. It wasn't fun anymore. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. All of the excitement was gone. All I was doing was worrying about things."

60|$|Sometimes a buoy is not laid at all, but the yawl goes ahead, {{hunting the}} best water, and the steamer follows along in its wake.

60|$|That Margaret and Barton {{were losing}} their hearts {{to each other}} could not, of course, escape the keen eye of Mrs. St. John Deloraine. She noticed that Margaret, though {{perfectly}} restored to health, and lacking only the clear brown over the rose of her cheeks, {{was by no means}} so light of heart as in the very earliest days of her recovery. Love makes men and women poor company, and, to speak plainly, takes <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> them. Margaret was absent-minded, given to long intervals of silence, a bad listener--all of them things hateful to Mrs. St. John Delo-raine, but pardoned, in this instance, by the benevolent lady. Margaret was apt to blush without apparent cause, to start when a knock came to the door, to leave the room hurriedly, and need to be sought and brought back, when Barton called. Nor was Barton himself such good company as he had been. His manner was uncertain and constrained; his visits began to be paid at longer intervals; he seemed to have little to say, or talked in fits and starts; and yet {{he did not know how}} to go away.|$|E
60|$|I took my wife's advice. I wrote {{a careful}} and {{complete}} {{account of the}} invention, and, sealing it up, I gave it to my lawyers to be handed to my son after my death.

5000|$|Children's {{literature}} expert May Hill Arbuthnot says of Caddie Woodlawn, [...] "this book is {{far less}} of a frontier story—settlers versus Indians—than it is the entertaining evolution of a tomboy. <b>The</b> <b>fun</b> Caddie gets <b>out</b> <b>of</b> life suggests the usefulness of this book in counteracting the overseriousness of most historical fiction." [...] Kirkus Reviews said it provides [...] "an authentic picture of life on a frontier farm when massacre was a real threat and when a livelihood, hardly earned, allowed for fun in natural outdoor things". It won the Newbery Medal in 1936.|$|R
5000|$|Among the {{pictures}} that were unfinished or not yet released {{at the time of}} his death were A Day at the Races, The Good Earth, Camille, Maytime and Romeo and Juliet.

"You see," [...] said he, in a jocular tone, {{for it was}} a most unusually severe {{accident}} indeed that could drive <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> our little friend--"you see, after I lost sight of Jack, I took a leaf out of the hare's book, and doubled on my course. This brought me, unhappily, to {{the banks of the}} river, where I came upon one of the pitfalls that are made by the niggers here to catch wild beasts, and in I went. I kept hold of the surface boughs, however, scrambled out again, and pushed on. But I had not gone ten yards when the ground began to crackle and sink. I made a desperate bound to clear it, but my foot caught in a branch, and down I went head foremost into the pit. And that's the whole of my story. How long I remained there I know not. If I had known what time it was when I dived in, and you were to tell me what o'clock it is now, we might arrive at a knowledge of the time I have spent at the bottom of that hole. All that I can positively affirm is, that I went in, and within in the last ten minutes I came out!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Men {{find their}} {{salvation}} nowadays in many ways. Names and forms don't, I think, matter very much; the real need {{is something that}} we can hold and that holds one. I have known a man find that determining factor in a dry-plate factory, and another in writing a history of the Manor. So long as it holds one, it does not matter. Many men and women nowadays take up some concrete aspect of Socialism or social reform. But Socialism for me has always been a little bit too human, too set about with personalities and foolishness. It isn't my line. I don't like things so human. I don't think I'm blind to the fun, the surprises, the jolly little coarsenesses and insufficiency of life, to the [...] "humour of it," [...] as people say, and to adventure, but that isn't the root of the matter with me. There's no humour in my blood. I'm in earnest in warp and woof. I stumble and flounder, but I know that over all these merry immediate things, there are other things that are great and serene, very high, beautiful things--the reality. I haven't got it, but it's there nevertheless. I'm a spiritual guttersnipe in love with unimaginable goddesses. I've never seen the goddesses nor ever shall--but it takes all <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the mud--and at times I fear it takes all the kindliness, too.|$|E
6000|$|Haney {{ignored the}} {{implications}} of her speech. [...] "I'm not tryin' to cover up me tracks," [...] said he. [...] "I was a gambler for thirty years. Me whole life has been a game of chance. There are many who think gambling one of the high crimes an' misdemeanors, but I think a square game between men is defensible. I am a gambler by nature. Why shouldn't I be? I grew up a fat squab of a boy rollin' about on the pavin'-stones of Troy. 'Twas all luck, bedad, whether I lived or died. I lived, it fell out, and when I had learned to read I read wild-West stories. Of course, that led me to go West and jine the Indians, and by stealin' rides and beggin' me bread I reached Dodge City. 'Twas all chance that I didn't die on the way. Me mother, poor soul, was worried and I knew it, and finally I put me fist to it and wrote her a letter to say I was all right. She wrote beggin' me to return, which I {{did a couple of}} years later; but Troy was too slow for me then, and again I pulled out. I was always takin' risks. Danger was me delight. I had no trade, but I had faith in me luck. I won--I almost always won. And so I came to be a gambler along with bein' sheriff and city marshal, and the like o' that, in one mountain town or another, but I always played fair. A man who plays a square game is a gambler. The man who deals underhand is a crook. I'm no crook. I love the game. To know that the cards are stacked against the other player takes all <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the deck for me. I want the other felly to have an equal chance with me--else 'tis no game, but a hold-up. No man ever rightfully accused me of dealing against him. Yes, 'tis true, me world is a world of risk."
