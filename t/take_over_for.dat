5|$|In {{the ensuing}} years, Abdullah leaves Afghanistan and Mr. Wahdati suffers a stroke, {{prompting}} Nila to take Pari {{and move to}} Paris, France. Nabi, while assuming the role of Wahdati's primary caregiver, finds a number of sketchbooks in Wahdati's closet filled with pictures of him drawn before the stroke. Unnerved by the discovery that Mr. Wahdati loves him, he resolves to leave but decides against it after {{he is unable to}} find someone suitable to <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> him. Nabi subsequently spends the next 50 years working for Mr. Wahdati. He develops a deep bond with his employer, and Nabi comes to the realization that his purpose is to take care of Mr. Wahdati. Later Mr. Wahdati's health deteriorates further, and Nabi helps him commit assisted suicide by kissing him on the lips and pressing a pillow over his face.|$|E
5|$|On June 13, 1781, Nicola and the Invalid Corps {{was given}} the order by Congress to move to West Point, New York. This, however, was {{difficult}} to accomplish. On June 26, Nicola {{wrote a letter to}} George Washington that the Corps would not move until a replacement unit could <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> them. Another reason hindering the move was pay; the Corps did not receive a payment for nearly ten months. A compromise was later reached between Nicola and the Board of War that six months pay would be given to the Invalid Corps. After their leave to Pennsylvania, John David Woelper, a captain of the Invalid Corps, sent a letter to Washington on July 20, 1781 claiming Nicola was treating the Corps badly. In the note, Woelper requested Nicola's arrest. Nicola sent letters about the situation to Washington, who wanted to have it settled as soon as the Corps arrived at West Point. Washington, who did not show any favoritism to either, sent both series of letters to General Alexander McDougall and asked the court in West Point to settle the matter.|$|E

Although Cobb was a legendary player, he was disliked throughout the baseball community, even by his own teammates; and he expected as much from his players since he set a standard most players couldn't meet.|$|E

25|$|Murrow gained {{his first}} glimpse of fame during the March 1938 Anschluss, in which Adolf Hitler {{engineered}} the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany. While Murrow was in Poland arranging a broadcast of children's choruses, he got word from Shirer of the annexation—and the fact that Shirer could not get the story out through Austrian state radio facilities. Murrow immediately sent Shirer to London, where he delivered an uncensored, eyewitness account of the Anschluss. Murrow then chartered the only transportation available, a 23-passenger plane, to fly from Warsaw to Vienna so he could <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> Shirer.|$|E

The game was {{expected}} to be a classic, however, a rain-soaked day made conditions difficult as Kilkenny aimed to secure a third successive championship. The first half was a low-scoring affair and provided little excitement for fans, however, the second half saw Cork completely <b>take</b> <b>over.</b> <b>For</b> the last twenty-three minutes Cork scored nine unanswered points and {{went on to win the}} game by 0-17 to 0-9.

With growing national support for the project, however, it became obvious to Hayden that passage of the bill was inevitable.

Ashurst, and was able to delay a vote of the full Senate on the measure {{until the end of the}} 70th Congress' first session. When the Swing-Johnston bill came up for a vote on May 28, 1928 Hayden made his first speech from the floor of the Senate, a filibuster in which he spoke for nine hours during an all-night session before allowing Ashurst to <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> another twelve hours.|$|E

He had a then unprecedented streak over two seasons, of 40 races, without a DNF, all with in-house engines. His only engine failure in the season was after the car crossed the finish line.

On June 16, Sorenson was hired by Red Bull Racing Team as substitute driver for car No. 83 and driver Brian Vickers. At the Coke Zero 400 at Daytona, Sorenson drove the No. 83 car to an eighth-place finish. It was the first top 10 for the team since Vickers was sidelined.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics.

He {{added that the}} staging and animation of the scene in which Homer tries to apologize to Burns [...] "will remain engraved in your memory {{in the same way}} as some of the series finest dialogue can". DVD Movie Guides Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and commented that [...] "any doubts about Smithers' sexuality will not last long when we see his vacation". Jacobson would have liked to see more scenes from Smithers' vacation, but he still thought the episode offered [...] "nice exposition" [...] for the character. He added: [...] "It’s fun to see more about his pampering of Burns, and it’s amusing to watch Homer <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> him." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be the scenes of Smithers on vacation. She concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of A. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it a [...] "very good episode, and an unusually straightforward one for this surreal season".|$|E

A new thug, Keith Faure (Kym Gyngell) (only named in the 2011 [...] "Uncut" [...] broadcast), offers to team up with Carl, while his real motive is to <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> himself. Several days later, Faure kills Lewis Moran in a crowded bar. Consumed by revenge for Benji's death, his friend, convicted killer Lewis Caine (Marcus Graham), decides to kill Condello, the only surviving member of the Carlton Crew. However, Caine is double-crossed by his accomplices and is murdered beforehand. Detective Owen has Condello's bodyguard [...] "Tibor" [...] arrested. They agree to have Tibor act as an undercover agent to record Condello ordering a hit on Carl. Meanwhile, Carl's jailed associates testify against him. In the series final episode, Task Force Purana and Owen arrest Carl at a family barbecue.

500|$|It is {{not just}} the women in his life that Lex has a {{difficult}} time maintaining a healthy relationship with, but his father as well. Rosenbaum characterizes the relationship between Lex and Lionel as a form of tug-of-war, and disagrees with John Glover's assessment that Lionel is merely testing Lex for the life he is going to <b>take</b> <b>over.</b> <b>For</b> Rosenbaum, Lex is being pushed and pushed, and Lex is afraid that he will reach the point that he knows he will {{no longer be able to}} come back from. In [...] "Vortex", Lex realizes that he forgot who he was in that moment that his father was trapped under the column, and he felt guilty over the situation. According to Rosenbaum, Lex realized that by letting his father die he would have been traveling down a dark path, and would have become all that his father was—evil. As Lex continues to live in his father's shadow, and as time progresses, he learns more about the [...] "monster" [...] that Lionel truly is. The breaking point comes when Lex learns that his father killed Lex's grandparents in a tenement fire. Rosenbaum sees this as the ultimate ethical dilemma—he likens it to parents learning that their child has murdered someone, and then having to decide if they should go to the authorities or not—and Lex, who can no longer take his father's abuse, decides to turn Lionel over to the FBI. According to Rosenbaum, the decision is justified to Lex, who sees that monster that Lionel really is from his actions—using electroshock therapy to erase Lex's memories, drugging Lex, killing his own parents, and the way he treated Lex's mother.|$|E
500|$|From 1968, Ted Kennedy was {{the most}} {{prominent}} living member of the Kennedy family, and the last surviving son of Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. John F. Kennedy had said in 1957, [...] "Just as I went into politics because Joe died, if anything happened to me tomorrow, my brother Bobby would run for my seat in the Senate. And if Bobby died, Teddy would <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> him." [...] However, Ted {{was never able to}} carry on the [...] "Camelot" [...] mystique {{in the same way that}} both of his fallen brothers had, with much of it disappearing during his failed 1980 presidential bid. His negligence in the death of Mary Jo Kopechne at Chappaquiddick and his well-documented later personal problems further tarnished his image in relation to the Kennedy name, and significantly damaged his chances of ever becoming president. The Associated Press wrote that, [...] "Unlike his brothers, Edward M. Kennedy has grown old in public, his victories, defeats and human contradictions played out across the decades in the public glare." [...] But Kennedy's legislative accomplishments remained, and as The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "By the early 21st century, the achievements of the younger brother would be enough to rival those of many presidents." [...] His death prompted the realization that the [...] "Camelot era" [...] was truly over. Kennedy's New York Times obituary described him via a character sketch: [...] "He was a Rabelaisian figure in the Senate and in life, instantly recognizable by his shock of white hair, his florid, oversize face, his booming Boston brogue, his powerful but pained stride. He was a celebrity, sometimes a self-parody, a hearty friend, an implacable foe, a man of large faith and large flaws, a melancholy character who persevered, drank deeply and sang loudly. He was a Kennedy." ...|$|E
