5|$|Moe's idea {{involved}} {{setting his}} bar on fire, which {{he ends up}} doing by accident as he realizes Renee has left. Meanwhile, Homer escapes jail by attacking Hans Moleman, who was delivering books to the inmates. He enters the burning bar to confront Moe, and the two start fighting. They are both soon rendered unconscious from smoke inhalation, but Barney appears and rescues them. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> completely destroyed, and during their reconciliation Homer promises to help Moe get back on his feet. In the final scene, Homer has allowed Moe to relocate his bar to the Simpsons' home.|$|E
5|$|The Doom Bar is a sandbar at {{the mouth}} of the Camel estuary on the north coast of Cornwall. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> {{composed}} mostly of coarse sediment carried up from the seabed by bed load processes, and it has been shown that there is a net inflow of sediment into the estuary. This inflow is aided by wave and tidal processes, but the exact patterns of sediment transport within the estuary are complex and are not fully understood. There is only a very small sediment contribution from the River Camel itself: most of the river's sediment is deposited much higher up the estuary.|$|E
5|$|Ezri Dax (Nicole de Boer), the station's counselor, has {{concerns}} with Nog {{living in a}} fictional world and speaks to Fontaine, who explains {{that he has a}} plan to rectify the situation. Fontaine convinces Nog that <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> in trouble and he needs some help with the accounts; the Ferengi uses his business knowledge to help the hologram. Fontaine befriends Nog and after a while tries to convince him to return to the outside world following prompting by Ezri. Nog refuses to leave, resulting in Fontaine shutting down his program and refusing to let it restart. Fontaine appears to Nog in an otherwise empty holosuite, and Nog confesses that his injury has made him fear death and the ongoing war with the Dominion. Fontaine counsels Nog, who feels strong enough to leave the holosuite and return to duty. Shortly after he resumes his role back on the station, Nog returns to Fontaine to inform him that he has convinced Quark to leave the program running continuously to allow Vic to have a life of his own.|$|E

5|$|Upstairs, Stewie takes drastic {{measures}} to protect his plans, programming the machine {{to go back in}} time before he drew them up. In the bar, Peter and Lois have a heart-to-heart conversation, and they do not immediately notice that <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> burning. When they try to escape, the stairs become blocked and they are trapped. Stewie reverses time just as Peter is having an epiphany about how poorly he treats Lois, and seconds before the basement bar goes up in flames. They all travel back in time, to when Lois asked Peter to take Chris to the game. While he is getting ready, Peter trips on Stewie's time machine, destroying it and injuring his leg, thus preventing him from taking Chris to his soccer match, while Stewie is left to suffer with more teething pain.|$|E
5|$|When {{someone is}} {{within range of}} a trap, a sensor bar will move into a red zone. Activating the trap at this moment will capture them. If the trap is {{activated}} when <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> not in the red zone, the trap will not work and will become disabled {{for a short period}} of time. The traps will also only work if the access code is correct. There are six possible access codes, and the player must eavesdrop into the conversations to find out when the Martins change the code. When a new code is learned, the player must wait until the speaker leaves the room before changing the access code to the correct color to maintain control of the traps. Counters on the screen indicate how many perpetrators have entered the house and how many have been captured.|$|E

25|$|A Bar collectively {{describes}} {{all members}} of the profession of barrister within a given jurisdiction.

25|$|The Ravitch {{technique}} is an invasive surgery that {{was introduced in}} 1949 and developed in the 1950s. It involves creating an incision along the chest through which the cartilage is removed and the sternum detached. A small bar is inserted underneath the sternum to hold {{it up in the}} desired position. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> left implanted until the cartilage grows back, typically about six months. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> subsequently removed in a simple out-patient procedure; this {{technique is}} thus a two-stage procedure.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bar</b> <b>is</b> {{situated}} on Shore Street, the harbour front in Anstruther, and is particularly popular with tourists.

It also hosts an ice cream parlour and sweet shop and employs over thirty staff. The most popular order is haddock and chips although trout, halibut and lemon sole are also served.|$|E

25|$|His procedure, {{widely known}} as the Nuss procedure, {{involves}} slipping {{in one or more}} concave steel bars into the chest, underneath the sternum. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> flipped to a convex position so as to push outward on the sternum, correcting the deformity. The bar usually stays in the body for about two years, although many surgeons are now moving toward leaving them in for up to five years. When the bones have solidified into place, <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> removed through outpatient surgery. Although initially designed to be performed in younger children (less than 10 years of age) whose sternum and cartilage is more flexible, there are successful series of Nuss treatment in patients well into their teens and twenties. The Nuss procedure is a two-stage procedure.|$|E

25|$|Bars are the inward {{folds of}} the wall, {{originating}} from the heels at an abrupt angle. The strong structure built up by the extremity of the heel and of <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> named the 'heel buttress'. The sole between the heel walls and the bars is named the 'seat of corn', {{and it is a}} very important landmark used by natural hoof trimmers to evaluate the correct heel height. The bars have a three-layer structure, just like the walls (see above). When overgrown, they bend outwards and cover the lower surface of the sole.|$|E
25|$|In December 2009, {{following}} {{the restoration of}} the station, a new pub, the Sheffield Tap, opened next to platform 1B. The room, located within the main station building, had been used as a store room for 35 years but was used for much longer as a bar and restaurant, catering for first class passengers since 1904. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> noteworthy for its restored early 20th century interior and its selection of quality cask ales and beers from around the world. Since opening, the bar has won the National Railway Heritage Award and the Cask Ale pub of the year award.|$|E

25|$|The Cuddalore Port {{operates}} at {{the confluence of}} the Gadilam River and the Paravanar River. The ships anchor in mid stream at a distance of about a mile from the shore, where cargo is loaded and discharged through lighters. There is a bar {{at the mouth of the}} combined river, which maintains a depth of 5 to 6 feet at low water. During the months of July to September, the depth over <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> reduced to about 3 to 4 feet. Other ports under construction in Cuddalore are Thiruchopuram port, Silambimangalam port, Parangipettai port(Porto Nova) and PY-03 Oil Field (Operational).|$|E
25|$|Negative {{feedback}} is a stabilising mechanism acting to oppose changes to coastal morphology and establish equilibrium. A coastal environment in equilibrium {{is able to}} dissipate or reflect incoming energy without the occurrence of sediment input or output and change to morphology. For example; when a beach in equilibrium erodes during a storm it forms an offshore bar that in turn forces waves to break over it. By doing this the waves {{lose a lot of}} energy and dissipate before reaching the shoreline, significantly reducing further erosion. When the storm calms, <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> then re-worked back on to the beach.|$|E
25|$|Nevada voters {{enacted a}} smoking ban ("The Nevada Clean Indoor Air Act") in November 2006 that became {{effective}} on December 8, 2006. It outlaws smoking in most workplaces and public places. Smoking is permitted in bars, {{but only if}} the bar serves no food, or <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> inside a larger casino. Smoking is also permitted in casinos, certain hotel rooms, tobacco shops, and brothels. However, some businesses do not obey this law and the government tends not to enforce it. In 2011, smoking restrictions in Nevada were loosened for certain places which allow only people age 21 or older inside.|$|E
