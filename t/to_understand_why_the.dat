5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give up hope even at the edge of the grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Chinese {{made such}} reports, Waley {{explained}} that any military action, whether successful or not, {{was followed by}} a scramble to get mentioned in the official report to the throne as an incentive for receiving a decoration, promotion, or other reward. The number of alleged casualties inflicted on the enemy was often based on what officers thought would entitle them to the reward they had in mind. Although Lin forwarded Lai's concocted reports to the Daoguang Emperor, Waley noted that it is unclear to what extent, if any, that Lin was aware of the fabrications, especially since he was regarded as a man of unusually high integrity by the British and Chinese. This was {{the first in a series}} of reports in which the emperor became aware in 1841 that the Canton authorities had been systematically deceiving him about events during the war. The emperor ordered the Governor of Guangxi, Liang Chang-chü, to send him clear accounts of the events at Canton, noting that since Guangxi was a neighbouring province, Liang must be receiving independent accounts. He warned Liang that he would be able to verify his information by secret inquiries from other places.|$|E

25|$|Given {{this sense}} of caution among {{key members of the}} British cabinet and of the army, it is even harder <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> British {{government}} went against the advice of its generals (such as Wolseley) to send substantial reinforcements to South Africa before war broke out. One strong argument is that Lansdowne, Secretary of State for War, did not believe the Boers were preparing for war, and also believed that if Britain were to send large numbers of troops, it would strike too aggressive a posture and so prevent a negotiated settlement being reached or even encourage a Boer attack.|$|E
25|$|Tocqueville's {{penetrating}} analysis {{sought to}} understand the peculiar nature of US political life. In describing the US, he agreed with thinkers such as Aristotle and Montesquieu that the balance of property determined the balance of political power, but his conclusions after that differed radically from those of his predecessors. Tocqueville tried <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> US was so different from Europe in the last throes of aristocracy. The US, {{in contrast to the}} aristocratic ethic, was a society where hard work and money-making was the dominant ethic, where the common man enjoyed a level of dignity which was unprecedented, where commoners never deferred to elites, and where what he described as crass individualism and market capitalism had taken root to an extraordinary degree.|$|E

25|$|James Clerk Maxwell {{published}} a famous paper in 1866 using the kinetic theory of gases to study gaseous viscosity. <b>To</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> viscosity {{is independent of}} pressure, consider two adjacent boundary layers (A and B) moving with respect to each other. The internal friction (the viscosity) of the gas {{is determined by the}} probability a particle of layer A enters layer B with a corresponding transfer of momentum. Maxwell's calculations show that the viscosity coefficient is proportional to the density, the mean free path, and the mean velocity of the atoms. On the other hand, the mean free path is inversely proportional to the density. So an increase in density due to an increase in pressure doesn't result in any change in viscosity.|$|E
25|$|Credit for {{the first}} {{psychology}} clinic in the United States typically goes to Lightner Witmer, who established his practice in Philadelphia in 1896. Another modern psychotherapist was Morton Prince. For the most part, {{in the first part}} of the twentieth century, most mental health care in the United States was performed by specialized medical doctors called psychiatrists. Psychology entered the field with its refinements of mental testing, which promised to improve diagnosis of mental problems. For their part, some psychiatrists became interested in using psychoanalysis and other forms of psychodynamic psychotherapy to understand and treat the mentally ill. In this type of treatment, a specially trained therapist develops a close relationship with the patient, who discusses wishes, dreams, social relationships, and other aspects of mental life. The therapist seeks to uncover repressed material and <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> patient creates defenses against certain thoughts and feelings. An important aspect of the therapeutic relationship is transference, in which deep unconscious feelings in a patient reorient themselves and become manifest in relation to the therapist.|$|E

This situation is common in JT systems, just as interactions between two nondegenerate electronic states are common for [...] non-JT systems. Examples are excited electronic states of NH3+ and the benzene radical cation. Here, crossings between the E and A state APESs amount to triple intersections, which are associated with very complex spectral features (dense line structures and diffuse spectral envelopes under low resolution).
