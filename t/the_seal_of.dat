5|$|King Arthur was {{assigned}} many different arms, {{but from the}} 13th century, he was most commonly given three gold crowns on an azure field (Loomis 1938, 38). In a 1394 manuscript depicting the Nine Worthies, Arthur is shown holding a flag with three gold crowns (Neubecker, 172). The reason for the triple-crown symbol is unknown, but it was associated with other pre-Norman kings, with <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> <b>of</b> Magnus II of Sweden, with the relics of the Three Wise Men in Cologne (which led to the three crowns in <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> <b>of</b> the University of Cologne), and with the grants of Edward I of England to towns which were symbolized by three crowns in the towns' arms. The number of crowns increased to eleven, thirteen and even thirty at times (Brault, 44–46).|$|E

5|$|From the 13th century onwards, the Court of Common Pleas could issue its own writs, {{and was not}} {{dependent}} on the Court of Chancery, where such documents usually originated. These were sealed with the Great Seal of the King until at least 1338, along with <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> <b>of</b> the justices; the Chancery writs had their own independent seal. Documents were, from 1350, considered acceptable if only marked with <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> <b>of</b> the justices. In 1344, the king created a separate seal for the Common Pleas, allowing them to process cases without involving the Chancery or the king. The court stood {{on an equal footing}} with the Exchequer of Pleas, Court of Chancery and King's Bench in relation to transferring cases between them. Any errors {{on the part of the}} Common Pleas would be corrected by the King's Bench through a separate action brought there. Thanks to the Bill of Middlesex and other legal fictions, the King's Bench gained much of the Common Pleas's jurisdiction, although the Common Pleas remained the sole place where real property claims could be brought.|$|E

5|$|Official state {{horses are}} one of many state symbols officially {{designated}} by states. Each state has its own flag and state seal, and many states also designate other symbols, including animals, plants, and foods. Such items usually are designated because of their ties to the culture or history of that particular state. In addition to being state symbols in their own right, horses have also appeared in state symbols; for example, a horse's head appears on <b>the</b> <b>Seal</b> <b>of</b> New Jersey.|$|E

In its first draft, Sub pecetea tainei was {{published}} by Gândirea in April 1930-April 1933, while Soborul țațelor was kept in three different variants. In a 1985 essay later published as a preface for Sub pecetea tainei, literary critic Nicolae Manolescu proposed that, while the story was not given a finishing touch, its plot was meant to seem ambiguous, and thus had led other commentators to wrongly assume that the text ended abruptly.|$|E
