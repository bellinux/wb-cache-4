50|$|Sparging is <b>trickling</b> <b>water</b> {{through the}} grain to extract sugars. This is a {{delicate}} step, as the wrong temperature or pH will extract tannins from the chaff (grain husks) as well, resulting in a bitter brew. Typically, 1.5 times more water is used for sparging than was for mashing. Sparging is typically conducted in a lauter tun.|$|R

50|$|The {{basic concept}} behind air {{conditioning}} {{is said to}} have been applied in ancient Egypt, where reeds were hung in windows and were moistened with <b>trickling</b> <b>water.</b> The evaporation of water cooled the air blowing through the window. This process also made the air more humid, which can be beneficial in a dry desert climate. In Ancient Rome, water from aqueducts was circulated through the walls of certain houses to cool them. Other techniques in medieval Persia involved the use of cisterns and wind towers to cool buildings during the hot season.|$|R

Droplets in a cloud sample are drawn into the conduit by a fan located at the back end of the conduit, impact upon the Teflon strands and are drawn down to the lower ends of the strands, where they drop and the accumulated droplets are diverted to a sample bottle for collection. The cloud <b>water</b> <b>collector</b> can be automated to collect a plurality of successive cloud water samples by an automated sampler containing a reservoir into which cloud water obtained in the cloud <b>water</b> <b>collector</b> is discharged. A motor-driven turntable is provided which holds a plurality of sample bottles. When the reservoir is filled to a predetermined volume, apparatus, such as a liquid level sensor, actuates a valve to open same and discharge the liquid sample from the reservoir into one of the bottles at a filling station on the turntable. The valve then closes and the turntable rotates to index the next bottle beneath the reservoir at the filling station, and the operation is repeated to fill the latter bottle. When all of the bottles on the turntable have been filled, the indexing mechanism is deactivated and liquid accumulating in the reservoir is diverted to an overflow bottle...|$|R

40|$|Accurate dust {{collectors}} {{are important in}} evaluating soil movement by wind. The relative efficiency of four types of eolian {{dust collectors}} was investigated by examining dust deposition efficiency in an eolian dust tunnel, and measuring long-term accumulation efficiency during a 24 -month field experiment in a desert environment. The deposition and accumulation surfaces of the collectors tested, were: (1) a dry and flat surface, (2) a flat but moist surface, (3) a surface composed of two superimposed layers of marbles, and (4) a free water surface. The <b>water</b> <b>collector</b> showed the highest efficiency, both for deposition and accumulation. Deposition efficiency of the marble collector was {{comparable to that of}} the <b>water</b> <b>collector,</b> but the former was more sensitive to post-depositional erosion. The effect of post-depositional erosion was most evident in the dry and the moist collectors tested. In general, deposition efficiency of the moist collector was lower than that of the dry collector. The latter was extremely sensitive to erosion, however, so that its accumulation efficiency was lower. Both collector types were less efficient than <b>water</b> and marble <b>collectors</b> for deposition as well as for accumulation. status: publishe...|$|R
