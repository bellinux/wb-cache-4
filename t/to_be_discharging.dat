60|$|If {{hitherto}} the follies of {{this man}} have cast an air of farce upon his sufferings, even when in part unmerited, such sentiments must now give place to that of indignation at his cruel and cold-blooded persecutors. Schubart, who never had the heart to hurt a fly, and with all his indiscretions, had been no man's enemy but his own, was conducted to a narrow subterraneous dungeon, and left, without book or pen, or any sort of occupation or society, to chew the cud of bitter thought, and count the leaden months as they passed over him, and brought no mitigation of his misery. His Serene Transparency of Würtemberg, nay the heroic General himself, might have been satisfied, could they have seen him: physical squalor, combined with moral agony, were at work on Schubart; {{at the end of}} a year, he was grown so weak, that he could not stand except by leaning on the walls of his cell. A little while, and he bade fair to get beyond the reach of all his tyrants. This, however, was not what they wanted. The prisoner was removed to a wholesome upper room; allowed the use of certain books, the sight of certain company, and had, at least, the privilege to think and breathe without obstruction. He was farther gratified by hearing that his wife and children had been treated kindly: the boys had been admitted to the Stuttgard school, where Schiller was now studying; to their mother there had been assigned a pension of two hundred gulden. Charles of Würtemberg was undoubtedly a weak and heartless man, but we know not that he was a savage one: in the punishment of Schubart, it is possible enough that he believed himself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discharging</b> an important duty to the world. The only subject of regret is, that any duty to the world, beyond the duty of existing inoffensively, should be committed to such hands; that men like Charles and Ried, endowed with so very small a fraction of the common faculties of manhood, should have the destiny of any living thing at their control.|$|E

50|$|Since 1930, {{the lake}} has {{gradually}} started receiving sewage and industrial effluents through the feeder nullahs.

A CERCLA removal action was initiated to address the discharges. The plume {{was found to be}} migrating 65 degrees oblique to the overall hydraulic gradient and was identified only after historic data were analyzed and field tests were performed under the working hypothesis of stratabound flow and transport. A detailed geologic and hydrologic analysis was performed that accurately predicted the 3 -dimensional plume configuration from a single point datum where significantly elevated contaminant levels were found in a bedrock core hole. Subsequent sampling found that direct discharges of contamination existed in the stream only in the location of the predicted stratum. The affected storm drain outfall discharges were suspected to be the major contributors to {sup 90 }Sr surface water risk from ORNL. Thus, the selected removal action focused on eliminating the known seepage to the storm drain network. Intercept system operations reduced the total surface water {sup 90 }Sr flux by about 90 %. Ongoing investigations seek to identify the source of the plume with the hope that the intercept system may eventually be deactivated. However, the efficiency of the system exceeded expectations and demonstrated that a good understanding of the hydrodynamics is a prerequisite to success. The relatively trouble free operation of the system also indicates that simple technologies can serve as effective measures to address immediate problems...|$|E
40|$|Background. Research {{suggests}} that inpatient geriatric evaluation and management units (GEMs), which undertake interdisciplinary diagnosis {{to improve the}} health of frail elderly patients, are effective. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) helped pioneer U. S. GEMs and mandates that every facility shall have a GEM by 1996. We conducted a population survey of VA GEMs in 1991 to assess their dissemination. Methods. Various organizational and performance characteristics of GEMs were entered in a data base derived from a piloted questionnaire and administrative records. Basic criteria from consensus reports were used to classify and compare "standard " and "nonstandard " GEMs. The criteria covered performance of assessment, team structure, patient selection, GEM location, and treatment functions. We analyzed the effect of GEM type and other factors on length of stay and placement. Reasons for closure of GEMs inactive in 1991 were recovered, and GEMs active in 1991 but later closed are described. Results. As of 1991, 41 of 73 GEMs were classified as standard, and 32 nonstandard. Standard compared to nonstandard GEMs had shorter stays (25. 4 vs 69. 9 days; p <. 001), higher home discharge rates (63. 4 % vs 40 %; p <. 001), and lower nursing home placement rates (19. 1 % vs 40. 3 %;p <. 001). Eleven hospitals had closed their programs by 1991. By 1993, 6 additional GEMs had closed; all were nonstandard in 1991. Conclusions. Most VA GEMs are organized according to basic consensus standards, and appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discharging</b> most patients {{back to the community}} after reasonably short stays. However, various resource constraints are common...|$|E

40|$|HIG Series, HIG-WRRC - 3 The {{rocks at}} the surface in Anaehoomalu and Lalamilo {{primarily}} are lavas from Mauna Loa which flowed through the saddle between Mauna Kea and Hualalai. These basalt lava flows, partly pahoehoe, but mainly aa, are generally quite permeable. No perched water or dike-impounded water is known in the area, certainly not close to the shore, and the fresh ground water is believed to occur in a thin layer at about sea level. Ground-water flux through the Anaehoomalu and Lalamilo districts {{is thought to be}} quite low, owing to the small recharge which results from the generally low rainfall and the high evapotranspiration. Computations of recharge from annual rainfall and losses from evapotranspiration suggest that the discharge along the shoreline averages only a few million gallons per day per mile. Onshore reconnaissance, which included sampling and electrical resistivity, and an offshore conductivity survey confirm that fresh and brackish water appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discharging</b> along the coastline from Hapuna Bay to Keawaiki Bay in quantities too small to be easily detected. No anomalously high ground-water levels which might indicate the presenoe of large ground-water flows were detected. A preliminary survey of salinity of coastal wells, springs, and water hole, and a visual search for ground water discharging at the shoreline did not show any evidence of such discharges on the order of millions of gallons per day. These data prompted an offshore salinity survey and electrical resistivity profiling onshore. The offshore reconnaissance did not detect distinctly fresh water. However, ten areas of discharge of brackish or fresh water were detected. Although it is extremely difficult to determine the exact volume of discharge, a reasonable estimate of the volume of flow of brackish and fresh-water discharges ranges from a few tens of thousands of gallons per day at eight discharge points to perhaps one million gallons per day from each of the two larger discharge zones. No evidence indicates that the flow of brackish and fresh water from the ten discharge points detected by this survey exceeds a few million gallons per day. All of the brackish and fresh-water discharges were detected in bays. It is not known whether this represents the true pattern of discharge or whether water being discharged along headland areas is very rapidly dissipated because of the high concentration of surf energy. Electrical, resistivity profiles using a Wenner spread were taken at 185 locations and electrical resistivity soundings, using a Schlumberger spread, were made at three of these locations. The soundings showed ground water to be very conductive up to sea level, and also indicated that the 70 -foot spacing between sounding sites was appropriate for the profiling. Neither a depression in the fresh-saline interface nor a higher permeability region having fresher water was indicated in the profile. Since profiling data are relative, interpretation is rather simple. By the combined use of sounding and profiling data, a layer of brackish water eight feet thick, equivalent to a head of two-tenths of a foot should have been discernible but no detectable fresh-water body of any thickness was found.

40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{was to determine if}} the cumulative impacts from point source discharges in the Kromdraai Catchment area sigdicantly impacting on the fitness of use of the surface water resource. The Kromdraai catchment area is located within the Upper Vaal Water Management Area and includes the Upper and Lower Wonderfonteinspruit, the Mooi River and the Loopspruit. The catchment area stretches from Krugersdorp to the confluence with the Vaal River and includes the towns of Westonaria, Carletonville, FochviUe and Potchefstroom. Various dams are situated within the catchment area, these include the Donaldson Dam, Klipdrift Dam, Boskop Dam, Klerkskraal Dam and the Potchefstroom Dam. In order to calculate relevant salt loads reference was made to the Best Practice Guideline Document for the compilation of water and salt balances (DWAF, 1999 b: 16). The assessment made use of the concentration of salts discharged in kg per day (also referred to as the Total Dissolved Salts or TDS in mg/l) in order to assess the levels of impact. The said method described was utilised throughout the assessment. In order to establish an informed assessment the following methodology was applied. Collation of information in order to obtain: - Understanding the activities of point source discharge. - Localities of discharge. - Quantities and qualities of discharge. Site visits to: - Obtain and clarify information. - Obtain additional information. - Form a holistic view of the area. Review of information: - Missing information was sourced. - Personal contact with point source dischargers. Cumulative impact assessment: - Impact was calculated in accordance to the guidelines of DWAF. Conclusions - Based on the results certain cumulative impact assessments were made, limitations and problem areas were highlighted and certain recommendations made. The following point source dischargers discharge directly into the surface water resource: Merafong City Lou 1 Municipality Oberholzer Sewage Works; Khutsong Sewage Works; Wedela Sewage Works; Welverdiend Sewage Works; Fochville Sewage Works; Mogale City Municipality Flip Human Sewage Works; Hannes van Niekerk Sewage Works; Potchefstroom Local Municipality Potchefstroom Water Care Works The following mining activities have a direct point source discharge point into the catchment area: GoldFieIds Limited - Hoof Gold Mine, Driefontein Consolidated Mines. AngloGold Ashanti - West Wits Durban Roodepoort Deep - Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mine Harmony Gold Mine - Deelkraal and Elandsrand, Randfontein Estates The conclusion that was formed {{based on the results of}} the different point source discharges was that: No single point of discharge can be identified as a major polluter. Certain of the point discharge sources were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discharging</b> water containing waste with TDS concentrations above the acceptable Water Research Commission Guideline (1998 : 59) for drinking water, however none of these point source discharges ever contained TDS concenhations of a magnitude that poses a risk to human health. The point source dischargers are cumulatively responsible for the raised levels of salts found in the surface water resource. It should be noted that this raised level is still not deemed to be a health risk to humans as per the standards. It was found that the state of especially municipal water care works is in need of urgent upgrading and maintenance as well as management. This was especially clear from site visits although not evident in the monitoring data. The assessment was done with data received from different point source dischargers. Throughout the assessment averaged figures were utilized. It should be noted that a great discrepancy exist in the methods used by the dischargers i. e. dates of sampling, times of sampling, methods of analysis, regularity of sampling and sampling methods. Final conclusion was that a uniform system of monitoring and analysis throughout the region would provide a much more accurate and clear indication of actual state and possible impact on the surface water resources.
