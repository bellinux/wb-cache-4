40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{security}} risk of a commercial aircraft, passengers are not allowed to take certain items in carry-on baggage. For this reason, human operators are trained to detect prohibited items using a manually controlled baggage screening process. In this paper, we propose the use of a method based on multiple X-ray views to detect some regular prohibited items with very defined shapes and sizes. The method consists of two steps: ‘structure estimation’, to obtain a geometric model of the multiple views from the object <b>to</b> be <b>inspected</b> (a <b>baggage),</b> and ‘parts detection’, to detect the parts of interest (prohibited items). The geometric model is estimated using a structure from motion algorithm. The detection of the parts of interest is performed by an ad-hoc segmentation algorithm (object dependent) followed by a general tracking algorithm based on geometric and appearance constraints. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experimental results on detecting regular objects −razor blades and guns − are shown yielding promising results...|$|R
50|$|These systems vary in the technology. AOI uses {{reflected}} light and cameras to capture images for analysis while AXI uses penetrating X-rays <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> solder joint quality. AOI {{technology can be}} deployed at various stages of a surface mount technology (SMT) line <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> solder paste deposition, component mounting and solder defects. X-rays can “see through” devices, for example, Ball-Grid Array devices, <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> solder connections beneath them.|$|R

40|$|Reliable Non Destructive Testing (NDT) {{is vital}} to the {{integrity}} and performance management of capital assets in safety critical industries such as aerospace, transportation, pipelines, petro-chemical processing, and power generation []. The structures that are <b>to</b> be <b>inspected</b> are usually very large and located in remote and hazardous environments. The NDT system has to be deployed by first providing very expensive access, requiring the erection of scaffolding and lengthy preparation before NDT can start. In addition the system must be capable of finding and characterizing component and structural defects to a high probability of detection thereby decreasing the probability of failure. Another priority is to reduce outage time as the cost of loss of production runs into millions. This presentation describes recent developments in mobile wall climbing, swimming and pipe crawling robots that provide the means to perform NDT on difficult to access structures and provide the possibility of carrying out the NDT in-service thus preventing costly outages. In confined and hazardous environments they are the only means to reach a test site and perform the NDT. Our research, funded by the European Commission and Industry, is developing mobile NDT Robots to go inside petro-chemical storage tanks (while full of product) <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> floors for pitting and corrosion [], to climb on the hulls of steel ships <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> hundreds of kilometres of weld [], <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> mooring chains securing off-shore oil and gas platforms in both air and underwater, <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> the walls of petro-chemical storage tanks for corrosion and weld integrity, <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> nozzle welds inside nuclear pressure vessels, <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> concrete structures such as dams and buildings, <b>to</b> internally <b>inspect</b> buried pipelines that are currently not reachable by intelligent pigs, to climb up off-shore wind turbine towers <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> the blades[], and to climb on aircraft wings and fuselage to detect for cracks and loose rivets...|$|R

5000|$|Denning {{essentially}} argues (not unlike noblesse oblige) that if {{an inspector}} has a statutory right <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> the property under construction, he thereby acquires a duty of care <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> carefully. That is to say: {{a person who has}} a right has duties attached to that right. But jurists Dias and Hohfeld have shown that rights and duties are jural correlatives. That is to say: if someone has a right, someone else owes a duty to them. So here, the inspector has a right (<b>to</b> <b>inspect),</b> and the builder has a duty <b>to</b> let them <b>inspect.</b> The later Murphy v Brentwood DC case revealed Denning's reasoning in Dutton to be flawed [...]The statement here that [...] "the inspector has a right (<b>to</b> <b>inspect),</b> and the builder has a duty to let them inspect" [...] does not correctly reflect the right/duty correlative as propounded by Dias. The inspector has right <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> and is duty bound to apply his professional expertise in carrying out the inspection. It is this 'expertise' of his that a third party would be relying on albeit not directly, but it is reasonable for a person purchasing a house to believe that 'if the District Council has certified a building as safe then it must be safe'. Thus, the inspector as a professional man has the right <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> and the duty to carry out that inspection with diligence and report to the 'community' any defect he finds in the building or his inability <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> at all or in full whether owing to obstruction by the builder or to any other reason, and not to certify the building as safe when he knew or ought to know that it was not.|$|R
