40|$|We have derived ozone and <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> to solar {{variability}} over a solar cycle, from 2002 to 2014 at 20 – 60  km and 48 ° S– 48 ° N, {{based on}} data from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument on the Thermosphere–Ionosphere–Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite. Simultaneous results for ozone and temperature with this kind of spatial coverage have not been previously available, and they provide the opportunity to study correlations between ozone and <b>temperature</b> <b>responses.</b> In previous studies, there has not been general agreement on the details or, at times, even the broad behavior of the responses to decadal solar variability. New results from a different dataset should supply new information on this important and interesting subject. A multiple regression is applied to obtain responses {{as a function of the}} solar 10. 7  cm flux. Positive responses mean that they are larger at solar maximum than at solar minimum of the solar cycle. Both ozone and <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> are found be positive or negative, depending on location. Generally, from [*]∼[*]  25 to 60  km, the ozone and <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> are mostly out of phase (negatively correlated) with each other as a function of solar variability, with some exceptions in the lower altitudes. These negative correlations are maintained even though the individual ozone (<b>temperature)</b> <b>responses</b> can change signs as a function of altitude and latitude, because the corresponding <b>temperature</b> (ozone) <b>responses</b> change signs in step with each other. From [*]∼[*]  50 to 60  km, ozone responses are relatively small, varying from [*]∼[*] − 1 to ∼[*]  2  %  100  sfu − 1 (solar flux units), while <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> can approach [*]∼[*]  2  °K  100  sfu − 1. From [*]∼[*]  25 to ∼[*]  40  km, the ozone responses have become mostly positive at all latitudes and approach a maximum of [*]∼[*]  5  %  100  sfu − 1 near the Equator and ∼[*]  30 – 35  km. In contrast, at low latitudes, the <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> have become negative but also reach a local maximum (near 32  km) in magnitude. The ozone and <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> remain mostly out of phase, with isolated exceptions at midlatitudes between [*]∼[*]  25 and 45  km. The general negative correlations are consistent with the idea that photochemistry is more in control in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere. The correlation coefficients between the solar 10. 7  cm flux and the ozone and temperature themselves from 2002 to 2014 are positive (negative) in regions where the responses are positive (negative).

In a recent study, in normal volunteers, flesinoxan induced a significant and dose-dependent increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH) {{and a decrease in}} body temperature. OBJECTIVES: In order to better define the role of 5 -HT receptor subtypes in response to flesinoxan, we assessed the influence of 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 2 antagonists on hormonal and <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> to flesinoxan. METHODS: Hormonal and <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> were studied in 6 volunteers with or without pretreatment with pindolol (30 mg p. o.), a 5 -HT 1 A antagonist, or ritanserin (10 mg p. o.), a selective 5 -HT 2 antagonist, using a double-blind crossover design. RESULTS: Pindolol significantly antagonized ACTH, PRL, GH and <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> to flesinoxan and ritanserin exhibited similar activity on PRL and ACTH responses.

5000|$|One popular {{technique}} for electro-thermal {{characterization of materials}} is the 3ω-method, in which a thin metal structure (generally a wire or a film) is deposited on the sample {{to function as a}} resistive heater and a resistance temperature detector (RTD).

There will be some delay between the heating of the sample and the <b>temperature</b> <b>response</b> which is dependent upon the thermal properties of the sensor/sample. This <b>temperature</b> <b>response</b> is measured by logging the amplitude and phase delay of the AC voltage signal from the heater across a range of frequencies (generally accomplished using a lock-in-amplifier).

40|$|We have derived ozone and <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> to solar {{variability}} over a solar cycle, from June 2002 through June 2014, 50 to 100  km, 48 ° S to 48 ° N, {{based on}} data from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument on the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite. Results with this extent of coverage in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere have not been available previously. A multiple regression is applied to obtain responses {{as a function of the}} solar 10. 7  cm flux (solar flux units, sfu). Positive responses mean that they are larger at solar maximum than at solar minimum of the solar cycle. From [*]∼[*]  80 to 100  km, both ozone and <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> are positive for all latitudes and are larger than those at lower altitudes. From [*]∼[*]  80 to 100  km, ozone responses can exceed 10  % (100  sfu) − 1, and <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> can approach 4  °K. From 50 to [*]∼[*]  80  km, the ozone responses at low latitudes ([*]∼[*] ± 35 °) are mostly negative and can approach [*]∼[*] negative 3  % (100  sfu) − 1. However, they are mostly positive at midlatitudes in this region and can approach [*]∼[*]  2  % (100  sfu) − 1. In contrast to ozone, from [*]∼[*]  50 to 80  km, the <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> at low latitudes remain positive, with values up to [*]∼[*]  2. 5  K (100  sfu) − 1, but are weakly negative at midlatitudes. Consequently, there is a systematic and robust relation between the phases of the ozone and <b>temperature</b> <b>responses.</b> They are positively correlated (in phase) from [*]∼[*]  80 to 100  km for all latitudes and negatively correlated (out of phase) from [*]∼[*]  50 to 80  km, also for all latitudes. The negative correlation from 50 to 80  km is maintained even though the ozone and <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> can change signs as a function of altitude and latitude, because the corresponding <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> change signs in step with ozone. This is consistent with the idea that dynamics have the larger influence between [*]∼[*]  80 and 100  km, while photochemistry is more in control from [*]∼[*]  50 to 75  km. The correlation coefficients between the solar 10. 7  cm flux and the ozone and temperature themselves from 2012 to 2014 are positive (negative) in regions where the responses are positive (negative). This supports our results since the correlations are independent of the multiple regression used to derive the responses. We also compare with previous results...|$|R

The ice recrystallization inhibition protein (IRIP) genes, fructosyltransferase (FST) genes, and many C-repeat binding factor (CBF) genes are Pooideae specific and important in low <b>temperature</b> <b>responses.</b> Here we used comparative analyses to study conservation and evolution of these gene families in B. distachyon to better understand its potential as a model species for agriculturally important temperate grasses. Results Brachypodium distachyon contains cold responsive IRIP genes which have evolved through Brachypodium specific gene family expansions. A large cold responsive CBF 3 subfamily was identified in B. distachyon, while CBF 4 homologs are absent from the genome. No B. distachyon FST gene homologs encode typical core Pooideae FST-motifs and low temperature induced fructan accumulation was dramatically different in B. distachyon compared to core Pooideae species.
