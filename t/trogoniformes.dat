25|$|Many {{species of}} birds are tetrachromatic, with {{dedicated}} cone cells for perceiving wavelengths in the ultraviolet and violet regions of the light spectrum. These cells contain a combination of short wave sensitive (SWS1) opsins, SWS1-like opsins (SWS2), and long-wave filtering carotenoid pigments for selectively filtering and receiving light between 300 and 400 nm. There {{are two types of}} short wave color vision in birds: violet sensitive (VS) and ultraviolet sensitive (UVS). Single nucleotide substitutions in the SWS1 opsin sequence are responsible blue-shifting the spectral sensitivity of the opsin from violet sensitive (λmax = 400) to ultraviolet sensitive (λmax = 310-360). This is the proposed evolutionary mechanism by which ultraviolet vision originally arose. The major clades of birds that have UVS vision are Palaeognathae (ratites and tinamous), Charadriiformes (shorebirds, gulls, and alcids), <b>Trogoniformes</b> (trogons), Psittaciformes (parrots), and Passeriformes (perching birds, representing {{more than half of all}} avian species).|$|E
2500|$|The trogons and quetzals are {{birds in}} the order <b>Trogoniformes</b> which {{contains}} only one family, the Trogonidae. The family contains 39 species in seven genera. The fossil record of the trogons dates back 49 million years to the Early Eocene. They might constitute {{a member of the}} basal radiation of the order Coraciiformes or be closely related to mousebirds and owls.

50|$|Afroaves is a clade of birds, {{consisting}} of the kingfishers and kin (Coraciiformes), woodpeckers and kin (Piciformes), hornbills and kin (Bucerotiformes), trogons (<b>Trogoniformes),</b> cuckoo roller (Leptosomatiformes), mousebirds (Coliiformes), owls (Strigiformes), raptors (Accipitriformes) and New World vultures (Cathartiformes). The most basal clades are predatory, suggesting the last common ancestor of the group was also.|$|E
50|$|Coraciimorphae is a clade {{of birds}} that {{contains}} the order Coliiformes (mousebirds) and the clade Eucavitaves (a large assemblage of birds that includes woodpeckers, kingfishers and trogons). The name however was coined in the 1990s by Sibley and Ahlquist based on their DNA-DNA hybridization studies conducted in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. However their Coraciimorphae only contain <b>Trogoniformes</b> and Coraciiformes.|$|E
50|$|Of these, the {{relationship}} of the Strigiformes is uncertain, whereas the first three groups almost certainly do not belong here; sandgrouse (Pterocliformes) may not even be higher landbirds. The Cuculiformes, Piciformes (including toucans), Coraciiformes (including hornbills) and <b>Trogoniformes</b> seem to be very close to the Passeriformes on the other hand (Johansson & Ericson 2003), and one of these almost certainly is—among the living birds—the sister taxon of the Passeriformes.|$|E
5000|$|At present, {{the closest}} living {{relatives}} of passerines {{are held to}} be the Piciformes, followed by the Coraciiformes. Neither of these two {{was included in the}} [...] "Passerae". The Coliiformes and <b>Trogoniformes,</b> while of unclear relationships among the [...] "higher landbirds", are also candidates for inclusion in a [...] "near passerine" [...] superorder. Insofar, it is actually hard to be less correct regarding the relationships of the perching birds than the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy.|$|E
50|$|The mousebirds (family Coliidae, order Coliiformes) are {{a family}} of birds. They are the sister group to the clade Eucavitaves, which {{includes}} the cuckoo roller (Leptosomatiformes), trogons (<b>Trogoniformes),</b> Bucerotiformes, Coraciformes and Piciformes. The mousebirds are therefore given order status as Coliiformes. This group is confined to sub-Saharan Africa, {{and is the only}} bird order confined entirely to that continent. They had a wider range in prehistoric times, with a widespread distribution in Europe and North America during the Paleocene.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of colour vision in birds: violet {{sensitive}} (VS) and ultraviolet sensitive (UVS). UVS birds have a visual pigment in the cones of their retinas that absorbs UV light, allowing them to see the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum. The major clades of birds that have UVS vision are Palaeognathae (ratites and tinamous), Charadriiformes (shorebirds, gulls, and alcids), <b>Trogoniformes</b> (trogons), Psittaciformes (parrots), and Passeriformes (perching birds, representing {{more than half of all}} avian species).|$|E

50|$|The cuckoo roller or courol (Leptosomus discolor) is {{the only}} bird in the family Leptosomidae, which is usually placed in the order Coraciiformes, which also {{includes}} the kingfishers, bee-eaters and rollers. However, its position is not very clear. Morphological evidence may suggest a placement in or near to Falconiformes. In the rather comprehensive DNA study by Hackett et al, this and the hoatzin {{are the only two}} birds whose position is unclear, although the cuckoo roller seems to be at the root of a group that contains the <b>Trogoniformes,</b> Bucerotiformes, Piciformes, and Coraciiformes.|$|E
40|$|Background: Colour {{vision in}} birds can be {{categorized}} into two classes, the ultraviolet (UVS) and violet sensitive (VS). Their phylogenetic distributions have traditionally been regarded as highly conserved. However, the complicated nature of acquiring spectral sensitivities from cone photoreceptors meant that until recently, only a few species had actually been studied. Whether birds are UVS or VS can nowadays be inferred {{from a wide range}} of species via genomic sequencing of the UV/violet SWS 1 cone opsin gene. Results: We present genomic sequencing results of the SWS 1 gene from 21 avian orders. Amino acid residues signifying UV sensitivity are found in the two most important spectral tuning sites 86 and 90 of Pteroclidiformes and Coraciiformes, in addition to the major clades, Palaeognathae, Charadriiformes, <b>Trogoniformes,</b> Psittaciformes and Passeriformes, where they where previously known to occur. We confirm that the presumed UVS-conferring amino acid combination F 86, C 90 and M 93 is common to Palaeognathae and unique to this clade, despite available spectrometric evidence showing the ostrich retina to be VS. Conclusions: By mapping our results together with data from previous studies on a molecular phylogeny we show that avian colour vision shifted between VS and UVS at least 14 times. Single nucleotide substitutions can explain all these shifts. The common ancestor of birds most likely had a VS phenotype. However, the ancestral state of the avian SWS 1 opsin's spectral tuning sites cannot be resolved, since the Palaeognathae are F 86, C 90 while the Neognathae are ancestrally S 86, S 90. The phylogenetic distribution of UVS and VS colour vision in birds is so complex that inferences of spectral sensitivities from closely related taxa should be used with caution.

40|$|In recent years, avian {{systematics}} {{has been}} characterized by a diminished reliance on morphological cladistics of modern taxa, intensive palaeornithogical research stimulated by new discoveries and an inundation by analyses based on DNA sequences. Unfortunately, in contrast to significant insights into basal origins, the broad picture of neornithine phylogeny remains largely unresolved. Morphological studies have emphasized characters of use in palaeontological contexts. Molecular studies, following disillusionment with the pioneering, but non-cladistic, work of Sibley and Ahlquist, have differed markedly {{from each other and}} from morphological works in both methods and findings. Consequently, {{at the turn of the}} millennium, points of robust agreement among schools concerning higher-order neornithine phylogeny have been limited to the two basalmost and several mid-level, primary groups. This paper describes a phylogenetic (cladistic) analysis of 150 taxa of Neornithes, including exemplars from all non-passeriform families, and subordinal representatives of Passeriformes. Thirty-five outgroup taxa encompassing Crocodylia, predominately theropod Dinosauria, and selected Mesozoic birds were used to root the trees. Based on study of specimens and the literature, 2954 morphological characters were defined; these characters have been described in a companion work, approximately one-third of which were multistate (i. e. comprised at least three states), and states within more than one-half of these multistate characters were ordered for analysis. Complete heuristic searches using 10 000 random-addition replicates recovered a total solution set of 97 well-resolved, most-parsimonious trees (MPTs). The set of MPTs was confirmed by an expanded heuristic search based on 10 000 random-addition replicates and a full ratchet-augmented exploration to ascertain global optima. A strict consensus tree of MPTs included only six trichotomies, i. e. nodes differing topologically among MPTs. Bootstrapping (based on 10 000 replicates) percentages and ratchet-minimized support (Bremer) indices indicated most nodes to be robust. Several fossil Neornithes (e. g. Dinornithiformes, Aepyornithiformes) were placed within the ingroup a posteriori either through unconstrained, heursitic searches based on the complete matrix augmented by these taxa separately or using backbone-constraints. Analysis confirmed the topology among outgroup Theropoda and achieved robust resolution at virtually all levels of the Neornithes. Findings included monophyly of the palaeognathous birds, comprising the sister taxa Tinamiformes and ratites, respectively, and the Anseriformes and Galliformes as monophyletic sister-groups, together forming the sister-group to other Neornithes exclusive of the Palaeognathae (Neoaves). Noteworthy inferences include: (i) the sister-group to remaining Neoaves comprises a diversity of marine and wading birds; (ii) Podicipedidae are the sister-group of Gaviidae, and not closely related to the Phoenicopteridae, as recently suggested; (iii) the traditional Pelecaniformes, including the shoebill (Balaeniceps rex) as sister-taxon to other members, are monophyletic; (iv) traditional Ciconiiformes are monophyletic; (v) Strigiformes and Falconiformes are sister-groups; (vi) Cathartidae is the sister-group of the remaining Falconiformes; (vii) Ralliformes (Rallidae and Heliornithidae) are the sister-group to the monophyletic Charadriiformes, with the traditionally composed Gruiformes and Turniciformes (Turnicidae and Mesitornithidae) sequentially paraphyletic to the entire foregoing clade; (viii) Opisthocomus hoazin is the sister-taxon to the Cuculiformes (including the Musophagidae); (ix) traditional Caprimulgiformes are monophyletic and the sister-group of the Apodiformes; (x) <b>Trogoniformes</b> are the sister-group of Coliiformes; (xi) Coraciiformes, Piciformes and Passeriformes are mutually monophyletic and closely related; and (xii) the Galbulae are retained within the Piciformes. Unresolved portions of the Neornithes (nodes having more than one most-parsimonious solution) comprised three parts of the tree: (a) several interfamilial nodes within the Charadriiformes; (b) a trichotomy comprising the (i) Psittaciformes, (ii) Columbiformes and (iii) Trogonomorphae (<b>Trogoniformes,</b> Coliiformes) + Passerimorphae (Coraciiformes, Piciformes, Passeriformes); and (c) a trichotomy comprising the Coraciiformes, Piciformes and Passeriformes. The remaining polytomies were among outgroups, although several of the highest-order nodes were only marginally supported; however, the majority of nodes were resolved and met or surpassed conventional standards of support. Quantitative comparisons with alternative hypotheses, examination of highly supportive and diagnostic characters for higher taxa, correspondences with prior studies, complementarity and philosophical differences with palaeontological phylogenetics, promises and challenges of palaeogeography and calibration of evolutionary rates of birds, and classes of promising evidence and future directions of study are reviewed. Homology, as applied to avian examples of apparent homologues, is considered in terms of recent theory, and a revised annotated classification of higher-order taxa of Neornithes and other closely related Theropoda is proposed. © 2007 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2007, 149, 1 – 95...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, I {{investigated}} the function {{and evolution of}} plumage-based visual signals in trogons (<b>Trogoniformes),</b> and assessed the influence of individual parameters in the receptor-noise model of colour discriminability. In Chapter 2, I {{investigated the}} function of tail raising in the elegant trogon. For this purpose, I used observational and experimental data collected in Costa Rica. Results demonstrated that tail raising in the elegant trogon is a multifunctional signal that targets both conspecifics and heterospecifics. Specifically, trogons used this behaviour during intra and intersexual interactions, and the experiment confirmed that tail raising is a pursuit-deterrent signal. In Chapter 3, I experimentally tested which plumage patches are used in species recognition in two species of trogons: the black-headed trogon, which is sympatric with a similar-looking congener, and the elegant trogon, which is not sympatric with a similar-looking congener. The results suggested that while both species use the back and belly colour as specie- recognition traits, the black-headed trogon but not the elegant trogon also assessed the tail banding pattern. In Chapter 4, I investigated the relationship between sympatry and plumage divergence in the genus Trogon. My results demonstrated that Trogon taxa diversified more rapidly, and that plumage trait divergence increased with sympatric overlap in South American but not Central American taxa. Together, my findings suggested that the rapid colonization of South America following the Great American Interchange resulted in reinforcement through character displacement or trait sorting. In Chapter 5, I investigated how dichromatism scores are influenced by individual parameters of the receptor-noise model of chromatic contrast threshold, using an avian-based tetrachromatic approach. I systematically tested parameter values for ambient light environment, photoreceptor sensitivities and densities, transmission properties of the ocular media and oil droplets, and compared the sensory experience of species for which the visual system has been fully characterized. My results demonstrated that oil droplet characteristics, photoreceptor densities, and {{the sensitivity of the}} SWS 1 photoreceptor (ultraviolet sensitive or not) had the most influence on dichromatism scores. I encourage the complete characterization of visual systems when possible, and my results will inform researchers when making inferences about tetrachromatic visual models...|$|E
40|$|As aves Caprimulgiformes formam um grupo bastante heterogêneo morfologicamente, a despeito da {{superficial}} similaridade de plumagem e dos hábitos noturnos. A maioria das hipóteses filogenéticas atuais são incongruentes entre si quanto ao relacionamento entre as famílias que compõem a ordem, exceto quanto ao posicionamento da família Aegothelidae, considerada mais próxima da ordem Apodiformes. Devido aos conflitos entre os estudos sistemáticos dessa ordem, e do aventado relacionamento próximo de alguns de seus representantes com a ordem Apodiformes, os objetivos desse estudo foram propor uma hipótese filogenética para as ordens Caprimulgiformes e Apodiformes com base em 120 caracteres osteológicos, utilizando-se representantes das ordens Psittaciformes, Strigiformes, Coraciiformes e <b>Trogoniformes</b> como grupos-externos na análise. Uma única árvore mais parcimoniosa demonstrou Steatornithidae e Podargidae como sucessivamente basais dentro da ordem, irmãs das demais famílias; um alto suporte ao clado composto pelas famílias Caprimulgidae e Nyctibiidae; e o relacionamento da família Aegothelidae com os Apodiformes, indicando o parafiletismo da ordem. A variação osteológica dentro das famílias é bastante notável, e importante fonte de caracteres para análises filogenéticas. Dessa forma, são propostas hipóteses filogenéticas para as famílias Nyctibiidae (incluindo fósseis) e Caprimulgidae, com base em 37 e 112 caracteres osteológicos, respectivamente. Com relação à primeira família, o padrão de relacionamento encontrado corrobora em parte os estudos moleculares prévios, particularmente quanto à posição basal de N. bracteatus. A variação osteológica entre as espécies daquela família indica que a atual sistemática da família, na qual todas as espécies são incluídas no gênero Nyctibius, deve ser revista. Com relação à família Caprimulgidae, a hipótese filogenética baseada nos caracteres osteológicos demonstrou: o parafiletismo das subfamílias tradicionalmente reconhecidas (Eurostopodinae, Chordeilinae e Caprimulginae); a posição basal dos gêneros Lyncornis e Eurostopodus (com baixo suporte ao parafiletismo desse último); um alto suporte ao gênero Chordeiles e indicação da revalidação dos gêneros Podager e Nannochordeiles; a posição basal de Nyctiprogne, Lurocalis e Nyctidromus, sucessivamente irmãs das demais espécies; e a existência de três clados, sendo um composto por espécies sul-americanas; um por espécies sul-, centro- e norte-americanas; e outro por espécies do velho mundo. Esses resultados corroboram em parte os estudos moleculares prévios e reforçam a importância da osteologia para o estabelecimento das relações filogenéticas nessa família, assim como o observado para a família Nyctibiidae e entre as famílias que compõem a ordem CaprimulgiformesThe avian order Caprimulgiformes is a morphologically heterogeneous group, {{in spite}} of their superficial resemblance and common nocturnal habits. The majority of the recent phylogenetic hypotheses are incongruent regarding the relationships among the families that compose the order, except regarding the position of Aegothelidae, which is considered more close related to the Apodiformes than to the remaining Caprimulgiformes. Due to the conflicts among recent studies, and the relationship of this order with the Apodiform birds, the main goal {{of this study was to}} propose a phylogenetic hypothesis of the Apodiform and Caprimulgiform families based on 120 osteological characters, with representatives of the orders Psittaciformes, Strigiformes, Coraciiformes and <b>Trogoniformes</b> as outgroups. A single most parsimonious tree revealed: Steatornithidae and Podargidae as basal taxa, nested at the base of the clade including all caprimulgiform and apodiform families; a strong support to a clade including Nyctibiidae and Caprimulgidae; and the close link of Aegothelidae to the Apodiform families, reinforcing the paraphyly of the order as mentioned in the literature but with an unprecedented morphological support. The remarkable variation among families strongly suggests the elevation of all families to the ordinal level. The noteworthy osteological variation observed within the families is also an important source of data to shed some light on the relationships among genera and species. Therefore, I propose the first phylogenetic hypotheses for the families Nyctibiidae (including fossils) and Caprimulgidae based on 37 and 112 osteological characters, respectively. Regarding Nyctibiidae, the relationships among species corroborate to some extent the previous molecular studies, mainly concerning the basal position of N. bracteatus, and suggest that the current systematics of the family, in which all species are included in the single genus Nyctibius, must be reviewed. Regarding the family Caprimulgidae, the data revealed: the paraphyly of the traditionally recognized subfamilies (Eurostopodinae, Chordeilinae and Caprimulginae); the basal position of the genera Lyncornis and Eurostopodus (with a weak support for the paraphyly of the latter); a strong support to the genus Chordeiles and the need for revalidation of Podager and Nannochordeiles; The basal position of Nyctiprogne, Lurocalis and Nyctidromus, nested at the base of a clade including all the remaining species; and the support of three clades, one including South American species; another one including South, Central and North American species; and another including old world species. These results corroborate to some extent previous molecular studies and emphasize the importance of the use of detailed osteological characters to the elucidation of the phylogenetic relationships in this family, as observed in Nyctibiidae and also among the families that compose the order Caprimulgiforme...|$|E
