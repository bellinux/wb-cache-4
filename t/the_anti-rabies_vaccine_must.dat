40|$|The {{presented}} report {{describes the}} epidemiology of potential rabies exposures and examines <b>the</b> utilization of <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> {{in a rural}} area of Ethiopia during a period of 43 months. A total of 683 persons (51. 1 % females, 73 % children) with animal- related bites were included in the retrospective, registry-based study. The most common site of exposure was the leg (66. 8 %). In children under 8 years of age the face was more often involved than in adults (9. 5 % vs. 4. 8 %; p= 0. 03). The main type of exposure was a bite with bleeding (66. 3 %) followed by contamination of mucous membranes with saliva (19. 7 %). The primary sources were dogs (93. 4 %) followed by cats (2. 6 %). Children under 15 years {{were more likely to be}} exposed to dogs (94. 9 %) than adults (88. 7 %) (p= 0. 01). The most common way of coming in contact with animals was ‘walking by’ (83. 9 %). Children came in contact with animals while ‘playing with’ (10. 7 %) more often than adults (1. 1 %) (p&amp;lt; 0. 001). All the patients received an <b>anti-rabies</b> nervous-tissue <b>vaccine,</b> 99 % of whom completed the vaccination course. Animal bites continue to be a problem in rural Ethiopia, mainly among children.

50|$|Roux and Yersin grew the {{bacillus}} {{that causes}} it and studied, thanks to various experiments {{they did on}} rabbits, its pathogenic power and symptoms, like the paralysis of the respiratory muscles. It is this last consequence of the diphtheria that provided the two researchers with a valuable clue {{of the nature of}} the disease, since it is caused by an intoxication due to a toxin introduced into the organism by the bacillus, that while secreting this particular venom is able to multiply itself: they were therefore inclined to think that the bacillus owed its virulence to the toxin. After filtrating the microbial culture of the Corynebacterium diphtheriae and injecting it into the lab animals, they were able to observe all the typical signs of the sickness. Roux and Yersin established that they were dealing with a new type of bacillus, not only able to proliferate and abundantly reproduce itself, but also capable of spreading at the same time a powerful venom, and they deduced that it can play the role of antigen, that is if they could overcome the delicate moment of its injection, made especially dangerous by the toxin.Some German researchers had also discovered the diphtheria toxin and were trying to immunize some guinea pigs through the use of a vaccine: one of them, Von Behring, Robert Koch's student, stated that he was able to weaken small doses of the toxin. Nonetheless Roux was not convinced by this result, since no-one knew the collateral effects of the procedure, and preferred to use serotherapy since more than one lab study - like the one accomplished by Charles Richet - demonstrated that the serum of an animal vaccinated against the disease included the antibodies needed to defeat it. The anti-diphtheria serum which was able to agglutinate the bacteria and neutralize the toxin was supplied by a horse inoculated with the viral germs, and it was separated from the blood drawn from the horses’ jugular vein. Like it happened for his teacher with <b>the</b> <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine,</b> Roux needed to test the effectiveness of the product he elaborated, and endured all the stress and ethical dilemmas that the first use of such a risky but also groundbreaking procedure implied. To test the serum two groups of children were chosen from two different hospitals: in the first one, which received the serum, 338 out of 449 children survived, in the latter one, treated with the customary therapies, only 204 out of 520 survived. Once the results were made public by Le Figaro newspaper, a subscription fund was opened to raise the money needed to provide the Institute the amount of horses necessary to produce enough serum to satisfy the national demand.|$|R
40|$|Rabies is a fatal {{disease that}} affects {{the central nervous system}} of all warmblooded mammals. The rabies virus belongs to the order Mononegavirales, family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus. This virus has a {{negative}} single-stranded RNA genome and the virions are bullet-shaped. Rabies is reported in many countries throughout the world and has been registered in all continents except Australia, where only the bat Lyssaviruses have been found, and in Antarctica where the main vectors of rabies are absent. Russia and most of the bordering countries are affected by rabies. Finland was a rabies-free country from 1959 to 1988, when a sylvatic rabies epidemic appeared with raccoon dogs as the main host and vector of infection. That epidemic was eradicated by the oral vaccination of wild carnivores and the parenteral immunization of dogs and cats; and Finland has been rabies-free since 1991. However, this status is constantly under threat because rabies is endemic in Russia and Estonia. In June 2003, a horse imported to Finland from Estonia was clinically and laboratory diagnosed as rabies positive. The close relationship of the isolated equine virus strain with the current Estonian strains was verified during subsequent molecular epidemiological studies. Because the case was imported, it did not affect Finland’s rabies-free status. Also in 2007 another 2 imported cases of rabies were recorded: one in a human being from Philippines and the other in a dog from India. Five different antigenic variants of the rabies virus were identified among rabies positive field samples from Russia, Finland, and Estonia by using antinucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies. Two rabies virus field isolates showed a different reaction pattern that was {{similar to that of the}} vaccine strains of the SAD group, which might suggest a new antigen variant or reverted vaccine strain. Nevertheless, the sequence analysis showed that the vaccine strains RV- 97 and SAD B 19 included in <b>the</b> oral <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> “Sinrab” (Russia) and “Fuchsoral” (Germany), respectively, differ considerably from all the field strains. Field rabies viruses collected in recent years from different regions of the Russian Federation were chosen on the basis of mAb studies and geographical origin for molecular epidemiological studies to characterize their genetic heterogeneity and to study their molecular epidemiology. In addition to the Russian viruses, archival samples from Estonia and Finland and Russian vaccine strains were also included in this study. Among the field viruses studied, two main phylogenetic groups were found, and designated as the Pan-Eurasian and Caucasian based on their geographical origin. The Pan-Eurasian 7 group including some reference viruses from Europe was further divided into four subgroups. All the vaccine strains were clearly different from the field strains. No recombination between the field and vaccine virus strains was observed. The critical roles of geographical isolation, the limitation of the genetic clustering, and the evolution of the rabies virus were shown during this study. The rabies virus vaccine strain RV- 97 is widely used in Russia as a component of <b>the</b> oral <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> “Sinrab”. To characterize the molecular properties of this strain, entire genome sequencing was conducted. A simple technique was developed to obtain this sequence, including the 3 ’- and 5 ’- ends. The entire genome sequence and deduced amino-acid sequences of the major viral proteins were compared with the sequences of other known fixed rabies viruses. The strain RV- 97 formed a separate phylogenetic branch and seems to be more related to the group of Japanese strains. The field strains from the Caucasian group seem to be phylogenetically the nearest group to the RV- 97 strain. The data shown herein makes it possible to develop molecular methods for distinguishing between the field rabies viruses from the vaccine strains for the rapid recognition of the vaccine strains that are unstable or have reverted back to their pathogenic form.

40|$|Background The {{outbreak}} of rabies in human in Bali-Indonesia is causing an extraordinary pressure {{for the government}} in providing adequate doses of <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Here, we directly compare the immune response and benefit of the intradermal (ID) protocol for rabies vaccine delivery with the intramuscular (IM) route. Methods: Sixty health workers {{who were willing to}} participate in this study have been randomly selected and grouped into ID, IM, and control groups, each with 20 volunteers. The Thai Red Cross ID- and Zangreb IM-protocols have been applied to the respective group. The sera of the volunteers were collected at day 0, week 1, week 3, week 4, month 3, month 6, month 9, and month 12 after <b>the</b> first vaccination. <b>Anti-rabies</b> virus IgG was detected using Platelia TM Rabies II Kit (Bio-Rad). Results: Anti-rabies IgG could be detected in the ID-group at one week. The ID-vaccine delivery induced a slightly higher maximum antibody titer compared to IM, though not statistically significant (p> 0. 05). ID vaccination caused less adverse reactions and produces longer lasting protective immune response.  Cost minimization analysis (CMA) on the provincial and national PEP data in 2009 - 2011 shows that the ID-delivery will reduce the total cost for a completed regimen by USD 28. 5, and would have saved the Indonesian government budget approximately USD 3. 6 and 4. 3 million for complete regimens in Bali and Indonesia, respectively. Conclusion: The ID administration of <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> induces a similar immune response compared to that of intramuscular injection. It also produces longer lasting protective immune response. It offers additional advantages of potential net cost savings as well as decreasing the pressure on vaccine availability due to the high number of dog bite cases. </p...|$|R

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for approving vaccines.|$|R
40|$|Although India {{accounts}} for nearly 50 % {{of the global}} rabies mortality, there is no organised national rabies control programme. Rabies control is generally confined to small urban pockets, with minimal intersectoral co-ordination. Tamil Nadu is the first state in India to implement a state-wide, multisectoral rabies control initiative. The CDC Program Evaluation Framework guided the current assessment of this rabies prevention and control initiative in Tamil Nadu. Principle stakeholders were engaged {{through a series of}} interviews in order to document policy initiatives, to describe the programme and to understand their various roles. Surveillance data on dog bites were triangulated with vaccine consumption and dog population data to identify trends at the district level in the state. Findings and recommendations were shared at different levels. Rabies control activities in Tamil Nadu were conducted by separate departments linked by similar objectives. In addition to public health surveillance, animal census and implementation of dog licensing rules, other targeted interventions included waste management, animal birth control and anti-rabies vaccination, awareness campaigns, and widespread availability of <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> at all public health facilities. In conclusion, this assessment suggests {{that it is possible to}} implement a successful ‘One Health’ programme in an environment of strong political will, evidence-based policy innovations, clearly defined roles and responsibilities of agencies, co-ordination mechanisms at all levels, and a culture of open information exchange...|$|R
40|$|The {{absence of}} {{standard}} guidelines from National and International regulatory agencies {{for the safety}} evaluation of biotechnology products challenges the ingenuity of toxicologists. At present, the development of standard pre-clinical toxicology protocols for Such products is on an individual case basis. The present investigation {{is an attempt to}} evaluate the safety profile of the first indigenously developed DNA based <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> in India. <b>The</b> test compounds were DNA rabies vaccine {DRV (100 mu g) } and combination rabies vaccine (CRV (100 mu g DRV and 1 / 50 dose of cell culture vaccine)), intended for clinical use by intramuscular route on 1, 7, 14 and 28 day. As per the regular mandatory requirements, the study has been designed to undertake acute (single dose- 10 days), sub-chronic (repeat dose- 28 days) and chronic (intended clinical dose- 120 days) toxicity tests using three dose levels viz. therapeutic, average (2 x therapeutic dose) and highest dose (10 x therapeutic dose) exposure in Swiss Albino mice. The selection of the rodent model viz. Swiss Albino mice is based on affinity and rapid higher antibody response during the efficacy studies. Apart from physical, physiological, clinical, hematological and histopathology profiles of all target organs, the tier-I immunotoxicity parameters have also been monitored. There were no observational adverse effects even at levels of 10 x therapeutic dose administration of DRV and CRV. The procedure also emphasizes on the designing of protocols for the products developed by recombinant technique...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} report an in vitro method for obtaining a {{secondary}} human antibody {{response to a}} dog kidney cell vaccine against rabies virus (DKCV) is described. Cultures of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} from normal rabies-immune and nonimmune donors were stimulated in vitro by DKCV. The production of virus-specific antibody in supernatant fluids was monitored by ELISA. Antibody was produced by lymphocytes from rabies-immune individu-als, whereas those of nonimmune subjects consistently failed to produce anti-rabies antibodies after in vitro stim-ulation with DKCV. The generation of <b>the</b> <b>anti-rabies</b> virus antibody response of lymphocytes stimulated with DKCV was shown to be an antigen-dependenty as well as an antigen-specific process. Optimal antigen-specific re-sponses were observed at relatively low concentration...|$|R
