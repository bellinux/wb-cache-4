5|$|In 1911, civil {{engineer}} Virgil Bogue presented {{a comprehensive plan}} {{for the city of}} Seattle, including an elevated rapid <b>transit</b> <b>line</b> running southeast from King Street Station through Chinatown towards the Rainier Valley. The plan was, however, rejected by voters on March 5, 1912, leaving it unimplemented. In 1957, Seattle City Engineer M. O. Anderberg and the Seattle Transit Commission proposed a rapid transit system utilizing the right-of-way cleared for Interstate 5 between Everett and Tacoma. The rapid <b>transit</b> <b>line</b> would travel through downtown Seattle in a tunnel under 5th Avenue, with one of its two stations at South Jackson Street at the site of Union Station. The proposal included redevelopment of Union Station into a multi-level transportation hub, with a bus terminal for intercity and suburban buses, a public parking garage, and a rooftop heliport. The proposal was rejected by the federal government, not wanting to jeopardize freeway construction, and was ultimately shelved.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{dates back}} to the designations of State Highway Route 31, which was main north–south highway in New Jersey. The Netcong Circle, a traffic circle in Netcong between NJ 183 and U.S. Route 46 was present for the entire {{lifetime}} of NJ 183 until it was replaced by a signalized intersection in 2013. A nearby bridge over a New Jersey <b>Transit</b> <b>line</b> was also replaced.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, plans for reopening the Staten Island Rapid <b>Transit</b> <b>line</b> in New Jersey were {{announced}} by the New York Port Authority. Since the Central Railroad of New Jersey became a New Jersey <b>Transit</b> <b>line,</b> a new junction would be built to the former Lehigh Valley Railroad. In order for all New England and southern freight {{to pass through the}} New York metropolitan area, a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Staten Island, and a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Greenville, New Jersey were planned. On December 15, 2004, a $72 million project to reactivate freight service on Staten Island and to repair the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge was {{announced by the}} NYCEDC and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Specific projects on the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge included repainting the steel superstructure and rehabilitating the lift mechanism. In June 2006, the freight line connection from New Jersey to the Staten Island Railway was completed, and became operated in part by the Morristown and Erie Railway under contract with the State of New Jersey and other companies.|$|E

5|$|Metro Transit {{opened the}} A Line, Minneapolis–Saint Paul's first {{arterial}} bus rapid <b>transit</b> <b>line,</b> along Snelling Avenue and Ford Parkway. The A Line connects the Blue Line at 46th Street station to Rosedale Center with a connection at the Green Line Snelling Avenue station. The A Line {{is the first}} in a series of planned arterial bus rapid transit lines and is set to open in early 2016.|$|E
5|$|Sound Transit {{expanded}} parking capacity at Everett Station to 1,067 spaces {{with the}} addition of 440 stalls, located east of the station and connected via a pedestrian overpass, that opened in May 2009 at a cost of $13.6 million. The southern lot of the station was cleared to build the terminus of Community Transit's Swift Bus Rapid <b>Transit</b> <b>line,</b> which began service on November 29, 2009, connecting Everett to Shoreline via the State Route 99 corridor.|$|E
5|$|Sound Transit {{plans to}} run a bus rapid <b>transit</b> <b>line</b> on SR522 from NE 145th Street to the University of Washington Bothell campus {{as part of its}} Sound Transit 3 program, {{approved}} in 2016. The line is scheduled to begin service in 2024 and will terminate at the NE 145th Street light rail station in Shoreline. The corridor has also been proposed for forms of rail transit since the mid-20th century, including the failed Forward Thrust ballot measures of 1968 and 1970, the Seattle Monorail Project, and light rail in the Sound Transit long-range plan.|$|E
5000|$|By 1916, the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) {{operated}} all streetcar {{and rapid}} <b>transit</b> <b>lines</b> in Boston. Original plans {{had called for}} an elevated rapid <b>transit</b> loop <b>line</b> through South Boston; however, that line was never constructed. Instead, South Boston was served by a network of surface streetcar lines that connected to the rapid <b>transit</b> <b>lines</b> at South Station, Broadway, and Andrew Square.|$|R

5|$|The first rapid <b>transit</b> <b>line,</b> the Holmenkoll Line, {{opened in}} 1898, with the branch Røa Line opening in 1912. It {{became the first}} Nordic {{underground}} railway in 1928 when the underground line to Nationaltheatret was opened. After 1993 trains ran under the city between the eastern and western networks in the Common Tunnel, followed by the 2006 opening of the Ring Line. All the trains are operated with MX3000 stock. These replaced the older T1000 stock between 2006 and 2010.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland has a bus {{and rail}} mass transit system {{operated}} by the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (RTA). The rail portion is officially called the RTA Rapid Transit, but local residents {{refer to it as}} The Rapid. It consists of two light rail lines, known as the Green and Blue Lines, and a heavy rail line, the Red Line. In 2008, RTA completed the HealthLine, a bus rapid <b>transit</b> <b>line,</b> for which naming rights were purchased by the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals. It runs along Euclid Avenue from downtown through University Circle, ending at the Louis Stokes Station at Windermere in East Cleveland. In 2007, the American Public Transportation Association named Cleveland's mass transit system the best in North America.|$|E
5|$|Swift {{launched}} on November 29, 2009 with a ribbon-cutting ceremony at Crossroads Station, {{and a day}} of free rides from 4:00p.m. to midnight. The following day {{marked the beginning of}} regular service, with the first runs departing their termini at 5:00am, and the new service attracted more than 1,500 riders, with end-to-end trips taking 20 minutes less compared to local buses on the same corridor. Swift debuted as the first bus rapid <b>transit</b> <b>line</b> in the state of Washington, ahead of King County's RapidRide, opening a year later in 2010, and one of the longest lines in the country when it opened.|$|E

5|$|The IND Culver Line (formerly BMT Culver Line) is a rapid <b>transit</b> <b>line</b> of the B Division of the New York City Subway, {{extending}} from Downtown Brooklyn south to Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York City, United States. The line {{is named after}} Andrew Culver, who built the original Culver Line that preceded the current subway line. The local tracks of the Culver Line are served by the F service, {{as well as the}} G between Bergen Street and Church Avenue. The express tracks north of Church Avenue have not been regularly used since 1976, while the peak-direction express track between Ditmas Avenue and Avenue X has not seen regular service since 1987.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of Toronto in the east, in the 19th century, {{led to the}} development of housing stock along the Kingston Road and Danforth Road corridors in Scarborough. This led to the creation of a <b>transit</b> <b>line.</b> In 1893, the Toronto and Scarboro' Electric Railway, Light and Power Company built a single-track radial line along Kingston Road to Blantyre. Over the next 13 years this was extended to West Hill. In 1904, the line became the Scarboro Division of the Toronto and York Radial Railway. Service continued along this line until 1936 when it was replaced by bus service.|$|E
5|$|Community Transit's {{planning}} for limited-stop bus service, which later evolved into bus rapid transit, {{began in the}} 1990s, with proposals to build bus lanes on State Route 99 between 145th Street NE in Shoreline and Casino Road (near State Route 526) in Everett. Sound Transit was established in 1996 as a regional transit authority, and selected the State Route 99 corridor as a route for its express bus system, but later replaced it, before service began, with an express route on Interstate 5 from Everett to Northgate, while leaving SR 99 to Community Transit. Sound Transit funded the construction of business access and transit lanes on State Route 99 through Lynnwood from 244th Street to 148th Street in 2002, converting former parking lanes, and widening the highway in some areas, improving existing bus service, and laying the ground for a future bus rapid <b>transit</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

5|$|Fares for Metro {{light rail}} service {{are the same}} as those for most Metro Transit bus {{services}} and include unlimited transfers to other light rail and bus routes within 2.5 hours from the time a fare is paid. Two exceptions exist for Metro light rail services: fares within (but not between) downtown zones are less expensive than regular fares but may not be transferred; and there is no cost to ride between terminals 1 and 2 at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport (MSP). Many stations connect with rail or bus routes. The Target Field station provides a connection to the Northstar commuter rail line, while the Mall of America station allows for transfers to the Metro Red Line bus rapid transit service. The A Line bus rapid <b>transit</b> <b>line</b> connects with the 46th Street Blue Line station and the Snelling Avenue Green Line stop. Two Metro light rail stations – 28th Avenue and Fort Snelling – have designated park and ride lots.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the New Jersey Department of Transportation {{proposed}} {{the elimination of}} the Netcong Traffic Circle, located at the intersections of U.S. Route 46 and Route 183 just north of the interchange with Interstate 80. The project was to produce two outcomes: replacement of the New Jersey Transit bridge that Route 183 crosses, and {{the elimination of the}} Netcong Circle with a signalized intersection. The project had issues dealing with the vertical clearance of the overpass for U.S. Route 46 westbound. The removal of the circle would eliminate this bridge, and the land would go to use as the new signalized intersection, with pedestrian and bicycle fittings. The entire project cost about $13.3 million (2009 USD) of state and local funds to construct. The Netcong Circle was replaced with a temporary junction in January 2013; the permanent intersection configuration opened in August of that year. The new bridge over the New Jersey <b>Transit</b> <b>line</b> opened in March 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Bergen Arches Expressway was {{proposed}} in 1989 by Governor Thomas Kean {{to connect the}} Jersey City waterfront with a new railroad line, which would provide access to the Meadowlands Sports Complex. This four-lane road was to follow an abandoned railroad line known as the Bergen Arches. This proposed highway was strongly supported by Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler, who felt that the road could bring further development, {{as well as provide}} traffic relief to the four-lane Route139. In 1998, this project was allocated $26million in the federal Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. Both Jersey City mayor candidates in 2001 supported a <b>transit</b> <b>line</b> instead of a highway along the Bergen Arches. Plans for a highway along the Bergen Arches were dropped in 2002 as leaders of Jersey City, including Mayor Glenn Dale Cunningham, favored mass transit.|$|E

5|$|The {{city has}} started {{moving away from}} the {{automobile}} and towards mass transit. From 2004 to 2009, the annual number of unlinked public transportation trips increased by approximately 21%. In 2006, voters in King County passed proposition 2 (Transit Now) which increased bus service hours on high ridership routes and paid for five bus rapid transit lines called RapidRide. After rejecting a roads and transit measure in 2007, Seattle-area voters passed a transit only measure in 2008 to increase ST Express bus service, extend the Link light rail system, and expand and improve Sounder commuter rail service. A light rail line from downtown heading south to Sea-Tac Airport began service on December 19, 2009, giving the city its first rapid <b>transit</b> <b>line</b> with intermediate stations within the city limits. An extension north to the University of Washington opened on March 19, 2016; and further extensions are planned to reach Lynnwood to the north, Des Moines to the south, and Bellevue and Redmond to the east by 2023. Voters in the Puget Sound region approved an additional tax increase in November 2016 to expand light rail to West Seattle and Ballard as well as Tacoma, Everett, and Issaquah.|$|E
25|$|MD 648 {{continues}} to parallel the <b>transit</b> <b>line</b> as a two-lane road north through Ferndale. The state highway passes the Ferndale {{station in the}} center of the community. MD 648 veers north away from the <b>transit</b> <b>line</b> at Hollins Ferry Road, then passes North County High School and crosses Cabin Branch. The state highway intersects Furnace Branch Road and the eastern end of MD 169 (Maple Road) prior to meeting I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. In the center of Pumphrey, MD 648 intersects MD 170, which heads northeast as Belle Grove Road and southwest as Camp Meade Road past the North Linthicum light rail station. The state highway passes under the Baltimore Light Rail tracks and begins to parallel them. MD 648 intersects MD 168 (Nursery Road) just west of the Nursery Road station shortly before the highway veers away from the <b>transit</b> <b>line</b> and crosses the Patapsco River.|$|E
25|$|METRORail {{expansion}} plans {{include the}} Uptown/Gold Line which will serve the Uptown Houston area and run primarily down the median strip of Post Oak Boulevard. In 2010, Houston Mayor Annise Parker announced {{that there were}} no available funds to construct the rail line, although it still remains in METRO's future expansion plans. In 2013, it was announced that the line will be constructed initially as a bus rapid <b>transit</b> <b>line,</b> but with the capability to convert to light rail in the future. The bus rapid <b>transit</b> <b>line</b> could be functioning as early as 2017.|$|E
