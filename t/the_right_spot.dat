5|$|Several years later, {{according}} to a narration collected by historian Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad was involved with a well-known story about setting the Black Stone {{in place in the}} wall of the Kaaba in 605 CE. The Black Stone, a sacred object, was removed during renovations to the Kaaba. The Meccan leaders could not agree which clan should return the Black Stone to its place. They decided to ask the next man who comes through the gate to make that decision; that man was the 35-year-old Muhammad. This event happened five years before the first revelation by Gabriel to him. He asked for a cloth and laid the Black Stone in its center. The clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and together carried the Black Stone to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>spot,</b> then Muhammad laid the stone, satisfying the honour of all.|$|E

The silver medal went to Marta Bastianelli (Italy), winning the chase group sprint half a minute behind. Third on the podium was another Dutch rider, Ellen van Dijk.|$|E
500|$|They {{decided to}} wait for the next man to come through the gate and ask him to make the decision. That person was 35-year-old Muhammad, five years before his prophethood. He asked the elders of the clans to bring him a cloth and put the Black Stone in its centre. Each of the clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and carried the Black Stone to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>spot.</b> [...] Then, Muhammad set the stone in place, {{satisfying}} the honour of all of the clans. After his Conquest of Mecca in 630, Muhammad is said to have ridden round the Kaaba seven times on his camel, touching the Black Stone with his stick in a gesture of reverence.|$|E

500|$|... "Let There Be Love" [...] {{combines}} {{a multitude of}} genres. It is a dance-pop, electronic dance music (EDM), and pop music song. It also contains electronica and trance influences. Aguilera's vocals here span from G3 to F5. It lasts for a duration of three minutes and 22 seconds. The instrumental consists of [...] "a propulsive beat and chewy synths", as well as [...] "loud drums" [...] and [...] "overwhelming" [...] electronica. According to Kitty Empire for The Guardian, the song is [...] "about as formulaic as club pop gets" [...] but [...] "resonates effectively." [...] Andrew Hampp for Billboard compared the song's instrumental to two songs recorded by Usher, [...] "DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love" [...] and [...] "Scream", {{both of which were}} produced by Martin. He also noted that Aguilera was probably aware that the [...] "Let There Be Loves melody bared strong resemblances to the songs, which most likely prompted her to spend [...] "the last minute wailing all over the place." [...] Aguilera [...] "roars" [...] the lyrics [...] "Let there be let there be love/ Here in the here in the dark" [...] over trance beats and projects a [...] "saucy" [...] tone as she sings [...] ""Hit <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>spot,</b> making my eyes roll back." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{ethereal}} aspects {{and double}} exposures were {{performed in the}} camera because {{the ability to create}} the effects in lab did not yet exist. Dwan made 24 dissolves in the film, each required precise control by the cameramen and that the counts had to be exact otherwise the shot would be ruined. Lombardi notes that the cinematographer, Walter Pritchard, was the man who had to go through the ordeal and that Universal said {{he was one of the}} company's oldest men. Dwan would claim that Pritchard would end up in the hospital from the production. In The Parade's Gone By, Brownlow instead gives the number of dissolves as 25 and adds to the story by Dwan claiming that the audience could not figure out the effect was done. Dwan also claimed that by the time 15 dissolves were done that the cinematographer was so nervous that the it would keep him up at night and cause his hands to shake so greatly that an assistant would have to reload the film at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>spot</b> before shots. This production may have been the last unbilled movie credit of Lon Chaney. The discovery of Lon Chaney's role was through Chaney having marked his appearance in a still with an X above his head. Chaney wrote [...] "This is me just below the X sign. Here I am a Russian Prince." [...] on the back of the still. The image still in particular leaves no question that it comes from The Restless Spirit because it also appears on the cover of The Universal Weekly for October 23, 1913. The second image found on the estate depicts Lon Chaney in the role of a wildman, which Mirsalis attributes to a fantasy sequence in the film.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} reagents {{which can be used}} to label terminal amino acids. They all react with amine groups and will therefore also bind to amine groups in the side chains of amino acids such as lysine - for this reason it is necessary to be careful in interpreting chromatograms to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>spot</b> is chosen. Two of the more common reagents are Sanger's reagent (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) and dansyl derivatives such as dansyl chloride. Phenylisothiocyanate, the reagent for the Edman degradation, can also be used. The same questions apply here as in the determination of amino acid composition, with the exception that no stain is needed, as the reagents produce coloured derivatives and only qualitative analysis is required. [...] So the amino acid {{does not have to be}} eluted from the chromatography column, just compared with a standard. Another consideration to take into account is that, since any amine groups will have reacted with the labelling reagent, ion exchange chromatography cannot be used, and thin layer chromatography or high-pressure liquid chromatography should be used instead.|$|E
