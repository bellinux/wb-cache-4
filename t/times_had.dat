5|$|After George Jones died in 1891, Charles Ransom Miller raised $1million {{dollars to}} buy the Times, along with other fellow editors at the newspaper, {{printing}} it under the New York Times Publishing Company. However, the newspaper was financially crippled by the Panic of 1893. By 1896, The New York <b>Times</b> <b>had</b> a circulation of less than 9,000, and was losing $1,000 a day when controlling interest in it was gained by Adolph Ochs, publisher of the Chattanooga Times for $75,000.|$|E

5|$|Kami, Perempuan {{was written}} by Armijn Pane, a Sumatra-born {{journalist}} and man of letters. Before the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies had begun in 1942, Pane had {{made a name for}} himself in helping to establish the magazine Poedjangga Baroe in 1933 and with his novel Belenggu (Shackles; 1940). His first stage play, Lukisan Masa (Portrait of the <b>Times),</b> <b>had</b> been performed and published in May 1937.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} cited human threat to birds is habitat loss. Other threats include overhunting; accidental mortality due to collisions with buildings and vehicles; long-line fishing bycatch; pollution (including oil spills and pesticide use), competition; predation; hybridisation from nonnative introduced or invasive species; and climate change. The collection of specimens for taxidermy and eggs {{from the wild}} has at <b>times</b> <b>had</b> a serious effect on some species. It is now forbidden in many countries, such as by the British Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.|$|E
5|$|To help counter these effects, in 2012 {{the various}} Chamonix-Mont Blanc {{authorities}} introduced a climate and energy action plan, committing {{the region to}} a 22% reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. The plan included proposals to improve air quality by banning those lorries from using the Mont Blanc Tunnel which were deemed {{to be the most}} polluting and which, at <b>times,</b> <b>had</b> reduced air quality to levels more usually associated with the streets of Paris.|$|E

5|$|Davies {{reacted to}} his deselection by announcing {{that the people}} of Merthyr, not the local Labour Party, would decide his future. If {{physically}} fit he would contest the next election as an Independent Socialist. Friends advised him not to risk humiliation; no deselected candidate in recent <b>times</b> <b>had</b> won election against the party machine, and Davies would, they predicted, get no more than 1,000 votes. Within a few days of the deselection meeting Wilson called a snap general election, which gave the Merthyr party little time to find their new candidate. They chose Tal Lloyd, an Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) official, a long-serving councillor and a former mayor, on the moderate wing of the Labour Party, and a strong supporter of Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Gustavus Adolphus {{chose to}} attack Riga, the Grand Duchy's {{foremost}} trade center, in late August 1621, {{just as the}} Ottoman army was approaching Khotyn, tying-up the Polish forces there. The city, stormed several <b>times,</b> <b>had</b> to surrender a month later. Moving inland to the south the Swedes next entered Courland. With Riga the Commonwealth lost the most important Baltic seaport {{in the region and}} an entry to northern Livonia, the Daugava River crossing. The 1622 Truce of Mitawa gave Poland the possession of Courland and eastern Livonia, but the Swedes were to take over most of Livonia north of the Daugava. The Lithuanian forces were able to keep Dyneburg, but suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Wallhof.|$|E

Gravel ended the session by, with no other senators present, establishing unanimous consent to insert 4,100 pages of the Papers into the Congressional Record of his subcommittee. The following day, the Supreme Court's New York Times Co. v. United States decision ruled in favor of the newspapers and publication in The Times and others resumed. In July 1971, Bantam Books published an inexpensive paperback edition of the papers containing the material The <b>Times</b> <b>had</b> published.|$|E

She increased the tempo and urgency from the original recording, but at <b>times</b> <b>had</b> difficulty in communicating with her band. Hill continued touring, including a set at the 6th Annual Jazz in the Gardens, in Miami Gardens, Florida in December. In Spring 2011, Hill performed at the Coachella Valley Music Festival, New Orleans Jazz Fest, and at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. In July 2011, Hill gave birth to her sixth child, Micah, her first not with Rohan Marley; the father remains publicly unknown.|$|E
5|$|On November 14, 2001, in The New York Times 150th anniversary issue, former {{executive}} editor Max Frankel wrote that {{before and during}} World War II, the NY <b>Times</b> <b>had</b> maintained a consistent policy to minimize reports on the Holocaust in their news pages. Laurel Leff, associate professor of journalism at Northeastern University, concluded that the newspaper had downplayed the Third Reich targeting of Jews for genocide. Her 2005 book Buried by the Times documents the paper's tendency before, during and after World War II to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of Jews, while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the Nazis' crimes on Jews in particular. Leff attributes this dearth {{in part to the}} complex personal and political views of the newspaper's Jewish publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, concerning Jewishness, antisemitism, and Zionism.|$|E
5|$|Over its 950 {{years of}} history Warwick Castle has been owned by 36 {{different}} individuals, plus four periods as crown property under seven different monarchs. It was the family seat of three separate creations of the Earls of Warwick, {{and has been a}} family home for members of the Beaumont, Beauchamp, Neville, Plantagenet, Dudley and Greville families. The first creation of the Earldom specifically included the right of inheritance through the female line, so the castle three <b>times</b> <b>had</b> a woman (or girl) as the owner. Eleven of the owners were under 20 when they inherited, including a girl aged two and a boy aged three. At least three owners died in battle, two were executed and one murdered. Every century except the 21st has seen major building work or adaptations at the castle.|$|E

5|$|Research by the Glasgow Media Group {{indicates}} that coverage of Sinn Féin by the BBC before the ban was minimal. In 1988 Sinn Féin was only heard or {{seen on television}} 93 <b>times,</b> <b>had</b> only 17 of the 633 formal BBC interviews as compared to 121 interviews with the Conservative Party and 172 with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the civil service, and were never interviewed in the studio like many other participants. However, after the ban there was a steep decline in coverage of Sinn Féin and Republican views, with television appearances being reduced to 34 times in the following year, and the delays and uncertainties caused by ambiguities, voice-overs and subtitles often led to coverage and films being dropped entirely.|$|E
5|$|Several {{months after}} opening in December 2015, a Sefton Council {{committee}} meeting recorded {{that the road}} was being very well used, with noticeably less traffic on the roads it was bypassing, those being the Northern Perimeter Road and Lydiate Lane respectively.

A year after opening, road users were giving generally positive feedback, with some confirming that travel <b>times</b> <b>had</b> been reduced and offers a more convenient means of accessing the motorways, although a common recurring concern were the junction issues at Switch Island.|$|E

On 22 February 1979, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly created monarchy of Saint Lucia.

Only in 2005–2006 did archaeological digs for the Marmaray project in the location of the Harbour of Theodosius (modern Yenikapi) uncover the remains of over 36 Byzantine ships from the 6th to 10th centuries, including four light galleys of the galea type.|$|E
5|$|The bad {{economic}} <b>times</b> <b>had</b> continued, {{and strengthened}} {{the hand of}} forces for free silver. The issue bitterly divided the Democratic Party; President Cleveland firmly supported the gold standard, but {{an increasing number of}} rural Democrats wanted silver, especially in the South and West. The silverites took control of the 1896 Democratic National Convention and chose William Jennings Bryan for president; he had electrified the delegates with his Cross of Gold speech. Bryan's financial radicalism shocked bankers—they thought his inflationary program would bankrupt the railroads and ruin the economy. Hanna approached them for support for his strategy to win the election, and they gave $3.5 million for speakers and over 200million pamphlets advocating the Republican position on the money and tariff questions.|$|E
