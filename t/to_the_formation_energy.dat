40|$|We {{describe}} in this lecture neutron irradiation experiments performed on superluid He- 3 -B at ultralow temperatures. The {{measurement of the}} thermal energy released by the neutron-He- 3 nuclear reaction reveals {{the existence of an}} energy deficit. We propose that this deficit can be ascribed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> of vortices, these topological defects being created by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism as the region heated to the normal state by the neutron irradiation recrosses the superfluid transition. A quantitative agreement is found with Zurek's predictions for the density of topological defects created during a rapid quench through a symmetry-breaking phase transition...|$|E

40|$|We {{present and}} discuss {{resonant}} photoemission (PES) spectra of Ti 4 O 7 taken at 50 and 300 K. The PES spectra {{taken in the}} metallic phase at 300 K show Ti 3 d bands at the Fermi level and O 2 p bands at higher binding energies. The intensity of the Ti 3 d bands increases for photon energies above 40 eV. This effect is attributed to a constructive interference with the Ti 3 p [...] > 3 d resonance which is confirmed by the corresponding constant-initial-state (CIS) spectra. The Ti 3 d bands shift approximately 0. 25 eV towards higher binding energies in the low temperature semiconducting phase at 50 K.

40|$|We have {{systematically}} {{studied the}} photocatalytic mechanisms of nitrogen doping in anatase TiO 2 using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, employing Hubbard U (8. 47 [*]eV) on-site correction. The impurity formation energy, charge density, and electronic structure properties of TiO 2 supercells containing substitutional nitrogen, interstitial nitrogen, or oxygen vacancies were evaluated {{to clarify the}} mechanisms under visible light. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>energy,</b> a substitutional N atom is better formed than an interstitial N atom, {{and the formation of}} an oxygen vacancy in N-doped TiO 2 is easier than that in pure TiO 2. The calculated results have shown that a significant band gap narrowing may only occur in heavy nitrogen doping. With light nitrogen doping, the photocatalysis under visible light relies on N-isolated impurity states. Oxygen vacancies existence in N-doped TiO 2 can improve the photocatalysis in visible light because of a band gap narrowing and n-type donor states. These findings provide a reasonable explanation of the mechanisms of visible light photocatalysis in N-doped TiO 2...|$|E
40|$|Different dopants {{with their}} {{specific}} dopant concentration can be utilized to produce ferroelectric HfO_ 2 thin films. In this work it is explored for {{the example of}} Sr in a comprehensive first-principles study. Density functional calculations reveal structure, formation energy and total energy of the Sr related defects in HfO_ 2. We found the charge compensated defect including an associated oxygen vacancy Sr_HfV_O to strongly favour the non-ferroelectric, tetragonal P 4 _ 2 /mnc phase energetically. In contrast, the uncompensated defect without oxygen vacancy Sr_Hf favours the ferroelectric, orthorhombic Pca 2 _ 1 phase. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> the uncompensated defect can form easily under oxygen rich conditions in the production process. Low oxygen partial pressure existing over the lifetime promotes the loss of oxygen leading to V_O and, thus, the destabilization of the ferroelectric, orthorhombic Pca 2 _ 1 phase accompanied by an increase of the leakage current.

40|$|Using the DFT {{supercell}} method, the BZ {{sampling error}} in the formation energy and atomic structure are investigated for vacancy and interstitial defects in diamond and silicon. We find that the k-point sampling errors in the total energy vary considerably depending on the charge state and defect type without systematic cancellation, even for the same size of supercell. The {{error in the}} total energy increases with decreasing electronic perturbation of the defect system relative to the perfect bulk; this effect originates in the localization of electronic states due to the symmetry reduction induced {{by the presence of}} a defect. The error in the total energy is directly transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>energy,</b> and consequently changes the thermodynamic stability of charge states and shifts the ionization levels. In addition, in force calculations and atomic structure determinations, the k-point sampling error is observed to increase as the charge becomes more negative. The Γ-point sampling results in erroneously large relaxation of the four atoms surrounding a vacancy in diamond. We suggest that stronger repulsions between electrons occupying degenerate defect levels at Γ-point compared to those occupying split energy levels at other k points induces larger atomic movements.

The stability of these complexes is calcu-lated using a Born-Haber cycle that was originally applied to determine the formation enthalpy of solid Cm intercalation com-pounds. We find that the formation energy of M@C 6 u depends crucially on the ionization potential and electron affmity of the endohedral atom and the Ce.,, molecule. A significant contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> comes from the polarization energy of the cage if the enclosed atom is not at the cage center; this finding is in agreement with available ab initio results.
