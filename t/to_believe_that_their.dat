Applewhite and Nettles told their followers {{that they would be}} visited by extraterrestrials who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated that he and his followers would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later, he came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> bodies were the mere containers of their souls, which would later be placed into new bodies. These ideas were expressed with language drawn from Christian eschatology, the New Age movement, and American popular culture.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critical}} scholars {{oppose the}} view that the sacred texts, including the Hebrew Bible, were divinely inspired. Many of these scholars accept the general principles of the documentary hypothesis and suggest that the Torah consists of inconsistent texts edited together in a way that calls attention to divergent accounts. Many suggest that during the First Temple period, the people of Israel believed that each nation had its own god, but that their god was superior to other gods. Some suggest that strict monotheism developed during the Babylonian Exile, perhaps in reaction to Zoroastrian dualism. In this view, it was only by the Hellenic period that most Jews came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> god was the only god and that the notion of a clearly bounded Jewish nation identical with the Jewish religion formed.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{government}} {{has become more}} efficient in its Internet regulations since the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen protest. On June 3, 2013, Weibo quietly suspended usage of the candle icon from the comment input tool, which netizens used to mourn the dead on forums. Some searches related to the protest on Chinese website services no longer come up with blank results, but with results {{that the government had}} “carefully selected.” These subtle methods of government censorship may cause netizens <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> searched materials were not censored. The government, however, is inconsistent in its enforcement of censorship laws. Netizens reported that searches of some censored terms on Chinese web services still resulted in blank pages with a message that says “relevant laws, regulations and policies” prevent the display of results related to the searches.|$|E

500|$|When the Spanish {{garrison}} marched out on 7 August {{almost all}} of the inhabitants, some 4,000 people in total, evacuated the town. They had reason <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> exile would not last long, as fortresses and towns changed hands frequently at the time. Many settled nearby in the ruins of Algeciras or around an old hermitage {{at the head of the}} bay in the expectation of a prompt return. They took with them the records of the city council including Gibraltar's banner and royal warrant. In time the refugee settlement at the hermitage developed into the town of San Roque. It was regarded by the Spanish, as Philip V put it in 1706, as being the [...] "City of Gibraltar resident in its Campo". A small population of around seventy neutral Genoese people stayed behind in Gibraltar.|$|E
500|$|After {{the failure}} of the Root and Branch Bill, Parliament in 1643 called {{together}} the Westminster Assembly of Divines, a body of lay politicians, lords, and clergy whose purpose was to reform church governance. [...] Vane sat on this body, which met periodically until 1648, as one of the lay representatives of the Independent faction. [...] Not long after its first meeting in July, Vane was sent {{at the head of a}} Parliamentary commission seeking military assistance from the Scots. [...] The Scots, who had been opposed to Charles in the Bishop's Wars (1639–40) over religious issues, were willing to assist the English Parliament if the latter were willing to allow the extension of the Presbyterian system of church polity to England. [...] Vane was opposed to both Presbyterianism and Episcopalianism, but found a way to finesse an agreement. [...] He proposed that the agreement, which covered a combination of religious and political topics, be called the Solemn League and Covenant, and he introduced slippery language into the agreement concerning [...] "the example of the best Reformed churches". [...] This language permitted the Scots <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> ideas would be adopted, while the English could interpret it to mean that English (i.e. Independent) practices could be adopted. [...] The league and covenant were eventually approved by authorities in Scotland, England, and Ireland, and paved the way for Scottish entry into the war.|$|E

However, she suffers a miscarriage and does not tell him, instead checking into Fairview Sanitarium; Case was disappointed when she heard that the character would be returning to the psychiatric facility. Case explained that Sharon was [...] "feeling insecure at the time about her [...] She was trying to build her relationship with Dylan and wasn't sure if {{he really wanted to}} be with her or if it was just because of the baby." [...] The actress also commented that Sharon did not want [...] "Dylan to go through what he went through before", having lost children previously.

At first, Case was not aware of Dr. Anderson's true identity, until she finally asked Bogush about her character. Dr. Anderson tells Sharon (who had been trying to conceive again) that she is pregnant, although in reality is drugging Sharon into experiencing a phantom pregnancy. Case said that she was [...] "up for anything" [...] upon learning that Sharon would be drugged. That November, Dr. Anderson presents Christian, the kidnapped newborn son of Nick's wife Sage Newman (Kelly Sullivan), to Sharon as her own child. Sharon, who does not remember giving birth, nevertheless accepts that the baby is hers, and names him Sully. Case noted that [...] "from Sharon's point of view, this woman pulled off a miracle.
