They were designed as test rounds to validate vehicle subsystems, such as booster stack combination performance, fin sets, payload deployment mechanism, telemetry and <b>trackability,</b> and inlet shroud, before flight testing the more complicated scramjet flowpath, which was to undergo proof-of-concept testing in a wind tunnel prior to flight testing.|$|E
50|$|For some {{while in}} the 1960s and 1970s SR-mount SLR lenses {{manufactured}} for the North American market were engraved with Rokkor-X rather than just Rokkor (as {{was used in the}} rest of the world) in order to improve <b>trackability</b> and dry out the gray market. Although some buyers from the USA and Europe each associated either the Rokkor-X or the non-X-ed Rokkor designation with a higher quality, respectively, both types of lenses were built to exactly the same specifications and quality standards in the factory. They differed only in their name plate. In the 1980s and 1990s, Minolta used a similar scheme for A-mount lenses, which were labelled Maxxum AF in the USA and Canada (where the A-mount camera bodies were labelled Maxxum) and just AF elsewhere (including in those regions otherwise using the Dynax and α labels for the cameras).|$|E
50|$|Guide wires are {{an example}} of an {{application}} for biomedical coatings. Guide wires are used in coronary angioplasty to correct the effects of coronary artery disease, a disease that allows plaque build up {{on the walls of the}} arteries. The guide wire is threaded up through the femoral artery to the obstruction. The guide wire guides the balloon catheter to the obstruction where the catheter is inflated to press the plaque against the arterial walls. Guide wires are commonly made from stainless steel or Nitinol and require polymer coatings as a surface modification to reduce friction in the arteries. The coating of the guide wire can affect the <b>trackability,</b> or the ability of the wire to move through the artery without kinking, the tactile feel, or the ability of the doctor to feel the guide wire's movements, and the thrombogenicity of the wire.|$|E

40|$|Many {{applications}} of current interests involve detecting instances of processes from databases or streams of sensor reports. Detecting processes relies on identifying evidences {{for the existence}} of such processes from usually noisy and incomplete observable events through statistical inferences. The performance of inferences can vary dramatically, depending on the complexity of processes ’ behavioral patterns, sensor resolution and sampling rate, SNR, location and coverage, and so on. Stochastic models are mathematical representations of all these factors. In this dissertation, we intend to answer the following questions:- Performance – How accurate are the inference results given the model?- <b>Trackability</b> – What are the boundaries of the performance of inferences?- Robustness – How sensitive is the performance of inferences to perturbations on input data or model parameters?- Methodology – How can we improve the <b>trackability</b> and robustness of process detection? From the information theoretic point of view, we address the reason of errors in detection to the losses of source information during the sensing stage, measured as entropy in the Shannon sense. We propose a series of entropic measures of the <b>trackability</b> and robustness for a popular modeling technique – hidden Markov models (HMM). Our major contributions include: the theory of trackability; structural analysis of <b>trackability</b> for HMMs through its non-parametric counterpart – DFA/NFAs; an effective visualization method for analyzing the <b>trackability</b> fo...|$|E

We evaluated the <b>trackability,</b> flexibility, and conformability of 17 coronary stents using specific mechanical bench tests. The quantifications used a dynamometer for assessment of <b>trackability</b> (maximal strength) and flexibility (stiffness) and a 3 D optical gauging machine for assessment of conformability (distance between stent and arterial wall in a curvature). The maximal strength (measuring the <b>trackability)</b> ranged respectively from 0. 24 ± 0. 06 and 0. 38 ± 0. 03 N (Seaquest) to 1. 31 ± 0. 42 and 1. 34 ± 0. 35 N (Carbostent), concerning respectively curvatures of 90 ° (P < 0. 0001) and 135 ° (P < 0. 0001). The stiffness (measuring the flexibility) ranged from 0. 53 ± 0. 16 (Seaquest) to 1. 28 ± 0. 10 N/mm (NIR Royal; P < 0. 0001).

40|$|We have {{developed}} a general framework, called a Process Query System (PQS), {{that serves as a}} foundation for formulating tracking problems, implementing software solutions to tracking problems and understanding theoretical issues related to tracking in specific scenarios. The PQS framework posits that an environment consists of multiple dynamical processes.

Examples of such dynamical processes are nondeterministic automata, Hidden Markov Models and classical state space models. We define a tracking problem as the inverse problem of determining the processes and process states that explain a stream of observations. This paper describes a quantitative concept of <b>trackability</b> by considering the rate of growth of state sequences of a process model given a temporal sequence of observations.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Gold {{has often}} been used in {{medicine}} because of its radiopacity and flexibility. To perform stent-supported coil embolization of intracranial aneu-rysms, we prepared a gold stent and examined its flexibility, radiopacity, and thrombogenic properties in comparison with a stainless steel device implanted in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Gold stents were prepared by plating gold on stainless steel stents as a template. Their mechanical properties and <b>trackability</b> in vitro were determined and {{compared with those of}} stainless steel stents of the same design. Twenty gold stents and two stainless steel stents were implanted in canine external carotid, vertebral, and renal arteries, as a muscle branch of the maxillary arteries, to examine their performance in vivo. RESULTS: The gold stent exhibited much less radial force and greater flexibility than the stainless steel stent. It also demonstrated superior <b>trackability</b> and radiopacity in the experi-mental endovascular procedures in canines.

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>trackability</b> is intimately {{related to the}} {{establishment}} of optimal trade-offs between the nosiness of the environment, due to poor sensing, and the randomness of the kinematics of the phenomena being examined, due to poor knowledge of their behaviors. Classically, a sensor system receives low level data in the form of numerical or analog signals and then through signal processing produces a high level observation suitable for a higher level state estimation process. These two phases may be further refined into a hierarchical chain of “tiers”, where observations at each level are obtained through the computation of a set of properties of the system’s estimated state at the lower level. An important factor that seems {{to have an impact on}} the overall ability to track high level phenomena in real time is the computational complexity of deciding those properties when generating observations between the tiers. And this complexity characterizes the accuracy of what can be computed within a bounded time frame. In this paper we intend to investigate the “real time ” <b>trackability</b> of phenomena through the analysis of the complexity of individual models in relation to the computational complexity of computing observations in any multi-tiered tracking system...|$|E

40|$|Background Intracranial stents have {{expanded}} endovascular therapy to wide neck aneurysms whose dimensions and configurations are not amendable to coil embolization alone. Stents however have not eliminated all problems due to technical factors with their delivery systems. The Neuroform stent system {{is one of}} the most widely used for this purpose and has undergone several technical modifications to improve deliverability. Despite improvements in the delivery system there are still reports of failure of stent deployment with the Neuroform 3. Here a simple back table modification is described in which the stent is pushed several centimeters back into the delivery catheter from its manufactured location. This makes the catheter tip more flexible and in our experience improves navigation through vessel curvature and increases deployment rate. Methods Our institution’s cerebrovascular database was reviewed retrospectively in compliance with institutional review board approval to identify all Neuroform 3 stents used for assistance with aneurysm embolization since the current stent design became clinically available. Records were reviewed to identify cases of failure of stent placement using the above described technical modification. Results 139 Neuroform 3 stents were placed at our institution for assistance with aneurysm embolization with the technique described above. Only three instances of failure of stent placement related to <b>trackability</b> of the delivery system were identified for a technical failure rate of 2. 2 %.

Visual servoing techniques have shown great promise as a control strategy capable of sub-micron precision while compensating {{for many of the}} problems that exist in the micro domain, including thermal expansion of assembly devices and imprecisely modeled and calibrated sensors and actuators. This project develops rules for micropart design to aid in device assemblability with visual servoing techniques by ensuring that the microparts can be easily tracked and controlled using vision feedback. A criterion is presented that estimates part <b>trackability</b> based on the visual appearance of the part. This criterion is then used to microfabricate features to improve part <b>trackability</b> and hence, the assemblability of the device. The criterion considers the feature appearance when the part lies out of the optical system's depth-of-field. A Fourier optics based approach is used to simulate the visual appearance of microparts represented by CAD models using high resolution optical systems. This simulation is used to automatically design microfabricated features on microparts. These features are used to estimate the tracking accuracy of the MEMS parts to subpixel levels using interpolation techniques in optical flow based tracking. This allows MEMS parts to be assembled with precisions on the order of 20 nm with high magnification lens, using visual servoing strategies. The curvature of the SSD surface is used to predict the tracking accuracy of the feature designed irrespective of defocus level and settings of the lens.

40|$|Multistatic sonar {{tracking}} is {{a difficult}} proposition. The ocean environment typically features very complex propagation conditions, causing low target probabilities of detection and high clutter levels. Additionally, most sonar targets are relatively low speed, which {{makes it difficult to}} use Doppler (if available) to separate target returns from clutter returns. The Maximum Likelihood Probabilistic Data Association Tracker (ML-PDA) and the Maximum Likelihood Probabilistic Multi-Hypothesis Tracker (ML-PMHT) [...] - a similar algorithm to ML-PDA [...] - can be implemented as effective multistatic trackers. This dissertation will develop a tracking framework for these algorithms. This framework will focus mainly on ML-PMHT, which has an inherent advantage in that its log-likelihood ratio (LLR) has a simple multitarget formulation, which allows it to be implemented as a true multitarget tracker. First, this multitarget LLR will be implemented for ML-PMHT, which will give it superior performance over ML-PDA for instances where multiple targets are closely spaced with similar motion dynamics. Next, the performance of ML-PMHT will be compared when it is applied in Cartesian measurement space and in delay-bearing measurement space, where the measurement covariance is more accurately represented. Following this, a maneuver-model parameterization will be introduced that will allow ML-PDA and ML-PMHT to follow sharply maneuvering targets; their previous straight-line parameterization only allowed them to follow moderately maneuvering targets. Finally, a novel method of determining a tracking threshold for ML-PMHT will be developed by applying extreme value theory to the probabilistic properties of the clutter. This will also be done with target measurements, which will allow the issue of <b>trackability</b> for ML-PMHT to be explored. Probabilistic expressions for the maximum values of the LLR surface caused by both clutter and the target will be developed, which will allow for the determination of target <b>trackability</b> in any given scenario...|$|E
40|$|Considering a {{checkpoint}} and communication pattern, the Rollback Dependency <b>Trackability</b> (RDT) property stipulates {{that there is}} no hidden dependency between local checkpoints. In other words, if there is a dependency between two checkpoints due to a non-causal sequence of messages, then there must exist a causal sequence of messages that "doubles" the non-causal one and that establishes the same dependency. This paper provides a minimal characterization of the RDT property. This characterization defines the smallest set of non-causal sequences of messages that have to be doubled in order to ensure the RDT property. Then, we consider the family of communication-induced checkpointing protocols that ensure on-the-fly the RDT property.
