50|$|While SI may {{be induced}} by {{multiple}} external factors, {{research suggests that}} a lack of control by tolerogenic dendritic cells and T-regulatory cells (Treg) is possibly the primary risk factor for the development of SI. In functioning immune responses, T-helper and T-cytotoxic cells are activated by presentation of antigens by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Chief among these are dendritic cells (DCs). When a DC presents an antigen to a <b>Treg</b> <b>cell,</b> a signal is then sent to the nucleus of the DC, resulting in the production of Indoleamine 2,3- Dioxygenase (IDO). IDO inhibits T cell responses by depleting tryptophan and producing kynurenine, which is toxic to the cell.|$|E

Methods. <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> were enumerated in peripheral blood and SF of RA patients and analysed by flow cytometry for expression of the proliferation marker Ki- 67 and binding of the apoptosis marker annexin V. Sorted <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> of RA patients were analysed for expression of anti-apoptotic regulators Bcl- 2 and microRNA- 21 (miR- 21) by RT-PCR. Results. <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> displaying a memory phenotype were abundant in the SF of RA patients. SF <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> more frequently expressed the proliferation marker Ki- 67 than conventional T cells.

CD 4 + CD 25 + <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> are well-known suppressive cells which express the transcription factor Foxp 3, are indispensable {{for the maintenance of}} immune self-tolerance and homeostasis by suppressing aberrant or excessive immune response.

Here we discuss the phenotypes and function of Foxp 3 + <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> and the potential use of such <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> against rheumatoid arthritis. Of note, even though most expanded populations of Foxp 3 + <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> exhibit suppressive activity, tissue-associated or antigen-specific <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> appear superior in suppressing local autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.

50|$|The TME {{may also}} {{directly}} impair intratumoral T cell proliferation. Indole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)—which {{can be expressed}} by DCs, MDSCs and cancer cells—catabolizes tryptophan and generates kynurenine. Both the deprivation of tryptophan and the generation of its metabolic product inhibit clonal T cell expansion. IDO also promotes the conversion of T cells to Treg cells and increases IL-6 expression, which augments MDSC functions. Accordingly, IDO1 genetic deficiency is associated with reduced tumor burden and metastasis and enhanced survival in mouse models of lung and breast cancer. The therapeutic potential of inhibiting IDO, in combination with anti-CTLA-4 was demonstrated in the B16 melanoma model and was associated with increased intratumoral T cells. IDO's capacity to block <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> to helperlike cell reprogramming by sustaining transcription factor Eos and the transcriptional program it regulates, also suppresses the immune response.|$|E

40|$|SummaryAppropriate {{development}} of regulatory T (Treg) cells {{is necessary to}} prevent autoimmunity. Neonatal mice, unlike adults, lack factors required for <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> development. It is unclear what these missing factors are. However, signals emanating from the T cell receptor (TCR), the costimulatory receptor CD 28, and the family of γc-dependent cytokine receptors are required for <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> development. Herein we demonstrate that expression of a constitutively active Stat 5 b transgene (Stat 5 b-CA) allowed for <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> development in neonatal mice and restored <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> numbers in Cd 28 −/− mice. Sequence analysis of TCR genes in Stat 5 b-CA Treg cells indicated that ectopic STAT 5 activation resulted in a TCR repertoire that more closely resembled that of naive T cells. Using MHCII tetramers to identify antigen-specific T cells, we showed that STAT 5 signals diverted thymocytes normally destined to become naive T cells into the <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> lineage. Our data support a two-step model of <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation in which TCR and CD 28 signals induce cytokine responsiveness and STAT 5 -inducing cytokines then complete the program of <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation...|$|E
40|$|SummaryT {{regulatory}} (<b>Treg)</b> <b>cells</b> {{play a role}} in {{the suppression}} of immune responses, thus serving to induce tolerance and control autoimmunity. Here, we explored whether <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> influence the immediate hypersensitivity response of mast <b>cells</b> (MCs). <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> directly inhibited the FcɛRI-dependent MC degranulation through cell-cell contact involving OX 40 -OX 40 L interactions between <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> and MCs, respectively. When activated in the presence of <b>Treg</b> <b>cells,</b> MCs showed increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations and reduced Ca 2 + influx, independently of phospholipase C (PLC) -γ 2 or Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores. Antagonism of cAMP in MCs reversed the inhibitory effects of <b>Treg</b> <b>cells,</b> restoring normal Ca 2 + responses and degranulation. Importantly, the in vivo depletion or inactivation of <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> caused enhancement of the anaphylactic response.

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{described}} that patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have increased numbers of regulatory T (<b>T(reg))</b> <b>cells.</b> In the present study, we analysed the mechanism behind <b>T(reg)</b> <b>cells</b> expansion in CLL. Neither analysis of the T-cell receptor repertoire nor CD 45 isoform expression of <b>T(reg)</b> <b>cells</b> from patients with CLL provided evidence for chronic (tumor) antigenic stimulation as a possible cause for <b>T(reg)</b> <b>cells</b> expansion in CLL. We found evidence however for increased formation of <b>T(reg)</b> <b>cells</b> via CD 70 costimulation, because we observed that CD 40 ligand activated CLL cells (which might be considered a model of lymph node CLL cells) strongly induced CD 70 -dependent formation of <b>T(reg)</b> <b>cells.</b> Reverse transcription-multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay expression analysis of 34 apoptosis-regulating genes showed that in comparison with other CD 4 (+) T-cells, <b>T(reg)</b> <b>cells</b> from both healthy individuals (HD) and patients with CLL had a high expression of pro-apoptotic Noxa and a low expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl- 2. Strikingly, Bcl- 2 levels of <b>T(reg)</b> <b>cells</b> in patients with CLL {{were significantly higher than}} in HD. Finally, the different apoptotic profile resulted in differences at the functional level, because <b>T(reg)</b> <b>cells</b> from patients with CLL were more resistant to drug-induced apoptosis than <b>T(reg)</b> <b>cells</b> from HD.

40|$|SummarySelf-reactive T cells {{can escape}} thymic {{deletion}} and therefore {{some of these}} potentially autoaggressive T cells need to convert into regulatory T (Treg) cells to help control responses against self. However, it remains unknown how peripheral self-reactive T cells are specifically instructed to become Treg cells. We report that CD 5, whose expression is upregulated in T cells by self and tolerizing antigens in the thymus and periphery, governed extrathymic <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> development.

In particular, shutdown of interleukin 2 (IL- 2) in the highly Th 1 cell-polarized environment triggered by infection directly contributes to <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> incapacity to suppress effector responses and eventually leads to immunopathogenesis. Furthermore, we found that environmental cues provided by both local dendritic cells and effector T cells can induce the expression of T-bet transcription factor and IFN-γ by Treg cells.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a {{plasma cell}} {{malignancy}} frequently associated with impaired immune cell numbers and functions. In MM, {{several studies have}} previously shown that CD 4 regulatory T (<b>Treg)</b> <b>cells</b> hamper effector T cell functions and enhance immune dysfunction. In this study, we aimed to prove the presence of functionally suppressive <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> expressing CD 8 phenotype (CD 8 <b>Treg</b> <b>cells)</b> in MM. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this has not been reported previously in MM. METHODS: We analyzed CD 8 <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> and their transcription factor FoxP 3 from 64 newly diagnosed MM patients using flow cytometry and real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RNA profile of cytokines in CD 8 <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> was also assessed using RT-PCR. CD 8 <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> from 5 MM patients and 5 healthy donors were functionally evaluated using proliferation assays. RESULTS: CD 8 <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> (CD 8 +CD 25 hi+) were significantly elevated in MM patients (P< 0. 0001), and their transcription factor FoxP 3 expression was also higher in MM (P< 0. 0001) compared to healthy donors which was evidenced by flow cytometry and RT-PCR analyses. CD 8 <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> negatively correlated with total lymphocyte count (P =  0. 016). Functional studies revealed that CD 8 <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> isolated from MM patients and healthy donors inhibited proliferation of CD 4 T cells in a concentration dependent manner. In the presence of CD 8 <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> in proliferation assays, level of IFN-γ was decreased but not IL- 10.

40|$|SummaryRegulatory T (Treg) {{cells are}} {{essential}} for maintaining immune homeostasis. Although Foxp 3 expression marks the commitment of progenitors to <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> lineage, how Treg cells are generated during lymphocyte development remains enigmatic. We report here that the c-Rel transcription factor controlled development of Treg cells by promoting {{the formation of a}} Foxp 3 -specific enhanceosome. This enhanceosome contained c-Rel, p 65, NFAT, Smad, and CREB. Although Smad and CREB first bound to Foxp 3 enhancers, they later moved to the promoter to form the c-Rel enhanceosome. c-Rel-deficient mice had up to 90 % reductions of Treg cells compared to wild-type mice, and c-Rel-deficient T cells were compromised in <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation. Thus, <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> development is controlled by a c-Rel enhanceosome, and strategies targeting Rel-NF-κB can be effective for manipulating <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> function...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral {{regulatory}} CD 4 + T cells (Treg cells) prevent maladaptive inflammatory {{responses to}} innocuous foreign antigens. <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> dysfunction {{has been linked}} to many inflammatory diseases, including allergic airway inflammation. Glucocorticoids that are used to treat allergic airway inflammation and asthma are thought to work in part by promoting <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation; patients who are refractory to these drugs have defective induction of anti-inflammatory Treg cells. Previous observations suggest that Treg cells deficient in the transcription factor FoxO 1 are pro-inflammatory, and that FoxO 1 activity is regulated by its phosphorylation status and nuclear localization. Here, we asked whether altering the phosphorylation state of FoxO 1 through modulation of a regulatory phosphatase might affect <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> function. In a mouse model of house dust mite-induced allergic airway inflammation, we observed robust recruitment of Treg cells to the lungs and lymph nodes of diseased mice, without an apparent increase in the Treg cytokine interleukin- 10 in the airways. Intriguingly, expression of PP 2 A, a serine/threonine phosphatase linked to the regulation of FoxO 1 phosphorylation, was decreased in the mediastinal lymph nodes of HDM-treated mice, mirroring the decreased PP 2 A expression seen in peripheral blood monocytes of glucocorticoid-resistant asthmatic patients. When we asked whether modulation of PP 2 A activity alters <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> function via treatment with the PP 2 A inhibitor okadaic acid, we observed increased phosphorylation of FoxO 1 and decreased nuclear localization. However, dysregulation of FoxO 1 did not impair <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation ex vivo or cause Treg cells to adopt a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, inhibition of PP 2 A activity did not affect the suppressive function of Treg cells ex vivo. Collectively, these data suggest that modulation of the phosphorylation state of FoxO 1 via PP 2 A inhibition does not modify <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> function ex vivo. Our data also highlight the caveat in using ex vivo assays of <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation and function, in that while these assays are useful, they may not fully recapitulate <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> phenotypes that are observed in vivo...|$|E
40|$|CD 4 +CD 25 + {{regulatory}} T (Treg) {{cells are}} crucial mediators of autoimmune tolerance. The factors that regulate Treg cells, however, are largely unknown.

The Treg cell-type CpG hypomethylation began in the thymus and continued to proceed in the periphery and could be fully established without Foxp 3. The hypomethylation was required for Foxp 3 + T cells to acquire Treg cell-type gene expression, lineage stability, and full suppressive activity.

Our results show that during normal pregnancy there is a generalised increase in <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> and mPRα+ <b>Treg</b> <b>cells,</b> from the second to the third trimesters (23. 4 % vs. 52. 3 % and 4. 3 % vs. 8. 3 %, respectively). On the contrary, on delivery day, compared with the values in the third trimester, there is a sudden decrease in both <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> (52. 3 % vs. 17. 4 %) and mPRα+ <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> (8. 3 % vs. 6. 1 %). Our findings suggest that human labour may develop as a consequence of a decline in mPRα+ <b>Treg</b> <b>cells,</b> which reduces progesterone anti-inflammatory action through <b>Treg</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|CD 4 +CD 25 +FOXP 3 + {{regulatory}} T cells (CD 4 + <b>Treg</b> <b>cells)</b> {{are thought}} to differentiate in the thymus and immigrate from the thymus to the periphery. <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> can regulate both acquired and innate immunity through multiple modes of suppression. The cross-talk between <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> and targeted cells, such as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T cells, is crucial for ensuring suppression by <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> in the appropriate microenvironment. Emerging evidence suggests that Treg compartmentalization and trafficking may be tissue or/and organ specific and that distinct chemokine receptor and integrin expression may contribute to selective retention and trafficking of <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> at sites where regulation is required. In this review, the cellular and molecular signals that control specialized migration and retention of <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Regulatory T (Treg) {{cells are}} a developmentally and {{functionally}} distinct T cell subpopulation that {{is engaged in}} sustaining immunological self-tolerance and homeostasis. The transcription factor Foxp 3 {{plays a key role}} in <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> development and function. However, expression of Foxp 3 alone is not sufficient for conferring and maintaining <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> function and phenotype. Complementing the insufficiency, Treg-cell-specific epigenetic changes are also critical in the process of <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> specification, in regulating its potential plasticity, and hence in establishing a stable lineage. Understanding how epigenetic alterations and Foxp 3 expression coordinately control Treg-cell-specific gene regulation will enable better control of immune responses by targeting the generation and maintenance of Treg cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{transcription}} factor Foxp 3 {{is essential for}} the development of regulatory T (Treg) cells, yet its expression is insufficient for establishing the <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> lineage. Here we showed that <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> development was achieved by the combination of two independent processes, i. e., the expression of Foxp 3 and the establishment of Treg cell-specific CpG hypomethylation pattern. Both events were induced by T cell receptor stimulation. The Treg cell-type CpG hypomethylation began in the thymus and continued to proceed in the periphery and could be fully established without Foxp 3. The hypomethylation was required for Foxp 3 (+) T cells to acquire Treg cell-type gene expression, lineage stability, and full suppressive activity. Thus, those T cells in which the two events have concurrently occurred are developmentally set into the <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> lineage. This model explains how <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> fate and plasticity is controlled and can be exploited to generate functionally stable Treg cells...|$|E
40|$|SummaryRecognition of self-antigens is {{required}} for regulatory T (Treg) cells to exert dominant tolerance. However, the mechanism by which self-reactive thymocytes are diverted into the <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> subset is unclear. To address this question, we looked for the immediate precursors to Treg cells within Foxp 3 −CD 4 +CD 8 − thymocytes. By using intrathymic transfer, {{we found that the}} CD 25 hi subset is highly enriched in <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> precursors. This was supported by tracking of thymocyte development via analysis of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires in a TCR-β transgenic model. These <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> precursors exist at a developmental stage where they are poised to express Foxp 3 without further TCR engagement, requiring only stimulation by interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) or IL- 15. Thus, we propose that the selection of self-reactive thymocytes into the <b>Treg</b> <b>cell</b> subset occurs via an instructive rather than stochastic-selective model whereby TCR signals result in the expression of proximal IL- 2 signaling components facilitating cytokine-mediated induction of Foxp 3...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDominant {{tolerance}} to self-antigen requires {{the presence of}} sufficient numbers of CD 4 (+) Foxp 3 (+) <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> with matching antigen specificity. However, the size and role of TCR repertoire diversity for antigen-specific immuno-regulation through <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> is not clear. Here, we developed and applied a novel high-throughput (HT) TCR sequencing approach to analyze the TCR repertoire of <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> and revealed the importance of high diversity for Treg-cell homeostasis and function. We found that highly polyclonal <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> from WT mice vigorously expanded after adoptive transfer into non-lymphopenic TCR-transgenic recipients with low Treg-cell diversity. In that system, we identified specific Treg-cell TCR preferences in distinct anatomic locations such as the mesenteric LN indicating that <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> continuously compete for MHC class-II-presented self-, food-, or flora-antigen. Functionally, we showed that high TCR diversity was required for optimal suppressive function of <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> in experimental acute graft versus host disease (GvHD). In conclusion, we suggest that efficient immuno-regulation by <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> requires high TCR diversity. Thereby, continuous competition of peripheral <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> for limited self-antigen shapes an organ-optimized, yet highly diverse, local TCR repertoire...|$|R
40|$|Although the cell-to-cell {{contact between}} CD 4 (+) Foxp 3 (+) {{regulatory}} T (Treg) and their target cells {{is important for}} the suppressor function of <b>Treg</b> <b>cells,</b> the regulation of this process is not well understood. Here we show that the Mst 1 kinase plays a critical role in the suppressor function of <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> through regulation of cell contact dependent processes. Mst 1 (-/-) <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> failed to prevent the development of experimental colitis and antigen-specific suppression of naïve T cells proliferation in vitro. Mst 1 (-/-) <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> exhibited defective interactions with antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs), resulting in reduced down-regulation of costimulatory molecules. While wild-type CD 4 (+) Foxp 3 (+) <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> formed mobile immunological synapses on supported planar membrane, Mst 1 (-/-) <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> did not exhibit ICAM- 1 ring or central peptide-MHC clustering. Using two-photon imaging we showed that antigen-specific wild-type <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> exhibited dynamic mobile contacts with antigen-pulsed DCs bearing stably associated naïve T cells. In contrast, Mst 1 (-/-) Treg had impairments in their interactions with DCs. Thus, Mst 1 is required for <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> to mediate contact-dependent suppressor functions...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} an {{increase}} of functional CD 4 +CD 25 + regulatory T <b>cells</b> (<b>Treg</b> <b>cells)</b> has been established for patients with solid tumors, acute leukemias, and lymphomas. We have reported an expanded pool of CD 4 +CD 25 high <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> in patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma (MM) {{as well as its}} premalignant precursor monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). In healthy individuals, low-level expression of CD 127 on T cells in addition to the expression of FOXP 3 has been associated with <b>Treg</b> <b>cells.</b> Here, we demonstrate that the expanded FOXP 3 + T-cell population in patients with colorectal cancer, CLL, MGUS, MM, follicular lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease are exclusively CD 127 low <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> and were strongly suppressive. A significant portion of CD 127 lowFOXP 3 + <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> expressed only low levels of CD 25 suggesting that the previously reported expansion of CD 25 + <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> underestimates the true expansion. The assessment of CCR 7 and CD 45 RA expression on the expanded CD 4 +CD 127 lowFOXP 3 + <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> revealed {{an increase of}} both naïve as well as central and effector memory <b>Treg</b> <b>cells</b> in peripheral blood.
