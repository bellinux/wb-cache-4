5|$|Initially, <b>the</b> <b>Ngô</b> family {{claimed that}} the army had carried out the raids, {{something}} their U.S. allies initially believed. However, this was later debunked, and the incident prompted the United States to turn against the regime and begin exploring alternative leadership options, eventually leading to Diệm's overthrow in a coup. In South Vietnam itself, the raids stoked widespread anger. Several high-ranking public servants resigned, and university {{and high school students}} boycotted classes and staged riotous demonstrations, resulting in further mass incarcerations.

5|$|Initially, the American embassy {{believed}} <b>the</b> <b>Ngô</b> family's {{claims that}} the regular army {{was responsible for the}} raids. The Voice of America, which was widely listened to in South Vietnam as the only non-Diệmist news source, initially aired Nhu's version of events, much to the dismay of the generals. The American media thought otherwise and began to debunk this theory, pointing out that <b>the</b> <b>Ngô</b> family constantly sought to undermine the army, and that Madame Nhu's joy over the events suggested the family had neither ceded power nor had their hands forced by the military. Furthermore, they identified Nhu's aides at the site, his idiosyncratic style in the announcements supposedly made by the ARVN, {{and the fact that the}} army had little motive to attack the Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1963, {{the coup}} went ahead, with Cao's troops {{isolated}} in the far south, and Tung's forces outside Saigon, unable to rescue Diệm from the rebel encirclement. Tung was called to the Joint General Staff (JGS) headquarters at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base under the pretense of a routine meeting, and was seized and executed. Attempts by Diệm and Nhu {{to make contact with}} Đính were blocked by other generals, who claimed that Đính was elsewhere. This led <b>the</b> <b>Ngô</b> brothers to think that Đính had been captured, still unaware that he had rebelled. The following morning, Đính was allowed to have the final word with Diệm before the brothers were arrested, allowing him to prove his loyalty to the rebel cause.

5|$|Tung {{was born}} in 1923 in central Vietnam, which was then the {{protectorate}} of Annam in French Indochina. The former servant of <b>the</b> <b>Ngô</b> family was devoutly Roman Catholic, short and bespectacled. Tung had a military background almost entirely in security and counterespionage, which was an unusual basis for leading the special forces. Tung had first served the French as a security officer in Central Vietnam. He then worked for Diệm as a lieutenant in the military security service in Central Vietnam. As a high-ranking official in Nhu's Cần Lao, the secret Catholic political apparatus which maintained <b>the</b> <b>Ngô</b> family's grip on power, Tung raised party funds by extorting money from wealthy businessmen. Tung was primarily known among colleagues for his unwavering loyalty to Diệm. In 1960, he was promoted straight {{to the rank of}} colonel and placed in charge of the special forces. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) regarded Tung as the third most powerful man in South Vietnam behind Diệm and Nhu, thereby ranking him as South Vietnam's most powerful military officer.|$|E
5|$|When {{rebel forces}} entered the palace, <b>the</b> <b>Ngô</b> {{brothers}} were not present, having escaped before to a loyalist shelter in Cholon. The brothers had kept {{in communication with}} the rebels through a direct link from the shelter to the palace, and misled them into believing {{that they were still}} in the palace. <b>The</b> <b>Ngô</b> brothers soon agreed to surrender and were promised safe exile; after being arrested, they were instead executed in the back of an armoured personnel carrier by ARVN officers on the journey back to military headquarters at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base. While no formal inquiry was conducted, the responsibility for the deaths of <b>the</b> <b>Ngô</b> brothers is commonly placed on Minh's bodyguard, Captain Nguyễn Văn Nhung, and on Major Dương Hiếu Nghĩa, both of whom guarded the brothers during the trip. Minh's army colleagues and US officials in Saigon agreed that Minh ordered the executions. They postulated various motives, including that the brothers had embarrassed Minh by fleeing the Gia Long Palace, and that the brothers were killed to prevent a later political comeback. The generals initially attempted to cover up the execution by suggesting that the brothers had committed suicide, but this was contradicted when photos of the Ngôs' corpses surfaced in the media.|$|E

5|$|By mid-October, Diệm and Nhu knew of {{the coup}} plans, but {{did not know that}} Đính was firmly among them, {{although}} they were wary of him. Nhu then decided to outwit the generals with a counter-plot. The generals heard of this and decided to counteract him. The other generals were still suspicious of Đính, fearing he would betray them. Having discovered that Nhu was trying to use him to trap them, and not sure which side he was really on, they promised to make him interior minister and offered other rewards if he helped to overthrow <b>the</b> <b>Ngô</b> brothers.|$|E

His period at the helm of South Vietnam's elite troops was noted mostly for his work in repressing dissidents, rather than fighting the Viet Cong insurgents.

5|$|Joseph Mendenhall, {{a senior}} Vietnam adviser in the US State Department, {{advocated}} {{the removal of}} Diệm in a military coup and his replacement with Thơ.

By this time, Diệm and Nhu realized a plot was afoot against them, but did not know that General Tôn Thất Đính, a palace favourite was involved.

The demonstrations and tension continued throughout July and August, with more self-immolations and an altercation (known as the Double Seven Day scuffle) between secret police and American journalists reporting on a Buddhist protest.|$|E
