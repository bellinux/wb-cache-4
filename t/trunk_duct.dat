50|$|Downstream {{of the air}} handler, {{the supply}} air <b>trunk</b> <b>duct</b> will {{commonly}} fork, providing air to many individual air outlets such as diffusers, grilles, and registers. When the system is designed with a main duct branching into many subsidiary branch ducts, fittings called take-offs allow {{a small portion of}} the flow in the main duct to be diverted into each branch duct. Take-offs may be fitted into round or rectangular openings cut into the wall of the main duct. The take-off commonly has many small metal tabs that are then bent to attach the take-off to the main duct. Round versions are called spin-in fittings. Other take-off designs use a snap-in attachment method, sometimes coupled with an adhesive foam gasket for improved sealing. The outlet of the take-off then connects to the rectangular, oval, or round branch duct.|$|E

Since, most of the HVAC company has lack of data for the designing purpose – leads to uncomforting. Less standardization in designing criteria of HVAC Systems (Except ASHRAE which provides data for refrigeration systems) leads to write this paper. There is no any sources available that can exactly says how to design an energy efficient HVAC Systems. This paper provides the mathematical aspects for designing the HVAC Systems. This paper includes the process of designing HVAC with components by using mathematical framework – confirmed by software. This paper provides proper selection of capacity of systems and life cycle cost analysis too. For the simplicity of understanding, we have provided a demonstration with the example of 1000 seats auditorium situated at Vadodara, Gujarat. As the result of this designing, we got an emission free HVAC Systems with low GWP (Global Warming Potential) and ODP (Ozone Depletion Potential) – providing best comfort condition with reduction <b>trunk</b> <b>duct</b> arrangement and low life cycle cost. However production side of the Ducting Systems will become more expensive and complex due to numbers of joints and duct sizes but after applying it properly – better performance and less frictional losses lead the system to high Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) ...|$|E

50|$|The {{company went}} {{underground}} {{in a big}} way in the 1920s, creating expensive new outside plant that fixed its geometry for the century to come. New cable ducts brought more reliable service to customers. They converged at approximately twenty wire centers, which were connected by larger <b>trunk</b> cable <b>ducts</b> running along the East and West Sides of Manhattan. The locations were a mile or two apart (2-3 km), close to concentrations of office workers without paying prime prices for land. At each wire center a new central office arose to house telephone switchboards, panel switches and other inside plant, and technicians, clerks, operators and other workers. The largest of these was also the corporate headquarters, at 140 West Street on the Lower West Side, about a kilometer (half mile) from AT&T HQ at 195 Broadway.|$|R
50|$|February 27, 1975 {{brought a}} fire in the {{telephone}} building at 204 Second Avenue, at East 13th Street. The MDF was destroyed, disconnecting tens of thousands of customers, and obsolescent switching equipment was destroyed or damaged by acrid smoke. Located {{at the south end of}} the East Side <b>trunk</b> cable <b>duct</b> under Second Avenue, this building connects many circuits to Brooklyn which were disrupted. A Bell System mobilization dealt with the crisis, including replacing the destroyed MDF. An obsolete and recently retired exchange at the West 18th Street office, not yet melted down for scrap metal, was temporarily resurrected to serve thousands of E13 customers though existing cross-town cables. The damaged Number One Crossbar Switching System (1XB switch) was cleaned, and a Number One Electronic Switching System (1ESS switch) that had been destined for the 104 Broad Street exchange was diverted. This was the largest loss of telephone service from fire in United States history until the September 11 attacks.|$|R

In the duodenum, especially, small processes, the villi project into the cavity, and being, like the small hairs of velvet pile, and as thickly set, give its inner coat a velvety appearance. In a villus we find (Figure IX., Sheet 3) a series of small blood-vessels and with it another vessel called a lacteal. The lacteals run together into larger and larger branches until they form a main <b>trunk,</b> the thoracic <b>duct,</b> which opens into the blood circulation at a point near the heart; but of this we shall speak further later. They contain, after a meal, a fluid called chyle.|$|R
25|$|In the {{majority}} of vertebrates, the mesonephros persists into the adult, albeit usually fused with the more advanced metanephros; only in amniotes is the mesonephros restricted to the embryo. The kidneys of fish and amphibians are typically narrow, elongated organs, occupying {{a significant portion of}} the <b>trunk.</b> The collecting <b>ducts</b> from each cluster of nephrons usually drain into an archinephric duct, which is homologous with the vas deferens of amniotes. However, the situation is not always so simple; in cartilaginous fish and some amphibians, there is also a shorter duct, similar to the amniote ureter, which drains the posterior (metanephric) parts of the kidney, and joins with the archinephric duct at the bladder or cloaca. Indeed, in many cartilaginous fish, the anterior portion of the kidney may degenerate or cease to function altogether in the adult.|$|R
40|$|A {{program to}} develop {{analytical}} tools {{for evaluating the}} dynamic performance of Air Cushion Landing Systems (ACLS) is described. The heave (vertical) motion of the ACLS was analyzed, and the analysis was extended to cover coupled heave-pitch motions. The mathematical models developed {{are based on a}} fundamental analysis of the body dynamics and fluid mechanics of the aircraft-cushion-runway interaction. The air source characteristics, flow losses in the feeding <b>ducts,</b> <b>trunk</b> and cushion, the effects of fluid compressibility, and dynamic trunk deflections, including ground contact are considered. A computer program, based on the heave-pitch analysis, was developed to simulate the dynamic behavior of an ACLS during landing impact and taxi over an irregular runway. The program outputs include ACLS motions, loadings, pressures, and flows as a function of time. To illustrate program use, three basic types of simulations were carried out. The results provide an initial indication of ACLS performance during (1) a static drop, (2) landing impact, and (3) taxi over a runway irregularity...|$|R
40|$|In muscular {{pulmonary}} atresia, major aortopulmonary collateral arteries {{are characteristic}} of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and are rarely seen in pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum. Two unusual cases of muscular pulmonary atresia are reported, one with an intact septum and one with a perimembranous ventricular septal defect, closed in utero by aneurysmal tricuspid tissue. In both cases the pulmonary blood supply came entirely from aortopulmonary collaterals. In case 1 a collateral artery connected the left subclavian artery and hypoplastic pulmonary arteries, and several aortopulmonary collaterals arose from the descending aorta, without overlap between these two circulations. In case 2 the pulmonary <b>trunk</b> and arterial <b>duct</b> were absent and the pulmonary blood supply came entirely from collateral arteries. The right ventricle was of normal size and tripartite with a closed perimembranous ventricular septal defect, discovered only at postmortem examination. These observations suggest right ventricular outflow tract obstruction early in fetal development, with involution of the pulmonary trunk and sixth arch derivatives, and persistence of primitive aortopulmonary connections. The morphology in case 1 {{is at odds with}} the theoretical division of pulmonary atresia with intact septum and pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect into two separate pathological entities that occur at different stages in fetal development...|$|R
40|$|The morphology, microanatomy and {{innervation}} of the biliary tree of the Australian possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, was examined. The gross morphology of the gallbladder, hepatic and cystic ducts, and {{the course}} of the common bile duct, conforms to those of other species. The sphincter of Oddi has an extraduodenal segment that extends 15 mm from the duodenal wall; within this segment the pancreatic and common bile ducts are ensheathed together by sphincter muscle. Their lumens unite to form a common channel within the terminal intraduodenal segment. Nerve cell bodies of the gallbladder were found in an inter-connecting network of ganglia that were located in the serosa, muscularis and mucosa. Nerve fibres innervated the muscle, arterioles and the mucosa. Few ganglia were found along the supra sphincteric portion of the common bile <b>duct.</b> Nerve <b>trunks</b> followed the <b>duct</b> and a dense nerve fibre plexus was found in the mucosa. In the sphincter most ganglia were located in two plexuses, the first between the layers of the external sphincter muscle, which was continuous with the external muscle of the duodenum, and the second was associated with the internal sphincter muscle. Nerve fibres were numerous in the sphincter muscle, and were also found in the subepithelial and periglandular plexuses of both the pancreatic and common bile ducts.

40|$|Multiple duct anastomoses during LLS {{transplantation}} {{increase the}} incidence of biliary complications. The optimal plane of hepatotomy that results in the least number of bile ducts at the surface was investigated according to LHD variations. Ducts of 30 human livers were injected with resin and LHD branching on 3 D-CT reconstructions were analyzed. Ducts on the virtual hepatotomy surface were estimated in three splitting lines. Variations with subtypes were described. Ia (66. 7 %) : ducts from segments (S.) II-III form a common trunk and S. IV duct joins it. Ib (10 %) : common <b>trunk</b> formed by <b>ducts</b> from S. II-S. III while S. IV duct joins the common hepatic duct. IIa (16. 67 %) : S. IV duct drains into S. III duct. IIc (3. 33 %) : S. IV duct drains into both S. II and S. III ducts. III (3. 33 %) : trifurcation of S. II, S. III and S. IV ducts. When the virtual hepatotomy line was on the FL, there was a single duct for the anastomosis in 30 % of cases but two, three, or four ducts in 53. 3 %, 10 %, and 3. 3 %, respectively. Division 1 cm {{to the right of}} the FL resulted in one duct (70 %), but S. IV duct injury may occur. LLS hepatotomy should not necessarily be performed along the FL. Variations must be taken into consideration to minimize the number of biliary anastomoses during liver implantation. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Bone {{morphogenetic}} proteins (BMPs) regulate essential processes during organogenesis, and {{a functional}} {{understanding of these}} secreted proteins depends on identification of their target cells. In this study, we generate a transgenic reporter for organogenesis studies that we use to define BMP pathway activation in the developing kidney. Results Mouse strains reporting on BMP pathway activation were generated by transgenically expressing β-galactosidase {{under the control of}} BMP responsive elements from Id 1. Reporter expression corresponds well with immunoassays for pathway activation in all organs studied, validating the model. Using these reporters we have generated a detailed map of cellular targets of BMP signaling in the developing kidney. We find that SMAD dependent BMP signaling is active in collecting <b>duct</b> <b>trunks,</b> but not tips. Furthermore, glomerular endothelial cells, and proximal nephron tubules from the renal vesicle stage onward show pathway activation. Surprisingly, little activation is detected in the nephrogenic zone of the kidney, and in organ culture BMP treatment fails to activate SMAD dependent BMP signaling in nephron progenitor cells. In contrast, signaling is efficiently induced in collecting duct tips. Conclusion Transgenic reporters driven by control elements from BMP responsive genes such as Id 1 offer significant advantages in sensitivity and consistency over immunostaining for studies of BMP pathway activation. They also provide opportunities for analysis of BMP signaling in organ and primary cell cultures subjected to experimental manipulation. Using such a reporter, we made the surprising finding that SMAD dependent BMP signaling is inactive in nephron progenitors, and that these cells are refractory to activation by applied growth factors. Furthermore, we find that the BMP pathway is not normally active in collecting duct tips, but that it can be ectopically activated by BMP treatment, offering a possible explanation for the inhibitory effects of BMP treatment on collecting duct growth and branching. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{design process}} of {{buildings}} include the planning where mechanical, electrical and plumbing equipment should be placed, known as mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) design. This report describes {{the design and}} implementation of a software extension to automate the placement of air ducts in buildings, for a building modeling software package called Revit. The main goal is a system that, given a building with unconnected vents, will produce ducts to connect those vents to a certain source. This report will discuss possible algorithms for solving the problem. One of these algorithms is an approach that creates a grid around each connector and uses Kruskal’s Algorithm to create a minimum spanning tree (MST) through that grid, to create the shortest path through all connectors. This algorithm did not yield optimal solutions as it tended to make too many corners. Also, “greedily” selecting all shortest paths between connectors often resulted in strange paths through the grid. Another approach, which is our final prototype, uses points created by the user which define the location where a main <b>trunk</b> of the <b>duct</b> system should be placed. The algorithm uses clustering techniques to divide the problem in smaller problems and will solve these clusters with structures that are regularly used in the building industry. It gives the user the opportunity to pick his or her desired solution for each cluster, enabling a lot of customization. Features of the system include wall avoidance {{and the use of}} duct connectors using industry standards. Features which are desirable but not implemented within this project are an extended three-dimensional sup- port, more and intuitive user interaction, more support for wall intersections and support for capacity calculations. The testing of the prototype is based on unit tests, where all classes are tested individually and extensively during the entire course of the project to make sure that no unforeseen situations would occur during the development process. The performance of the algorithm was tested by hand using different Revit models. During these tests we observed whether the decisions made by the algorithms followed the concepts of MEP design used in real life.

40|$|The {{results of}} the already {{published}} three reports and this paper are summarized as follows (ref. the summarized table) : 1. The 48 groups of lymph nodes were distinguished by their positions in the cat. Out of them, 9 groups : Lnn. subinguinales profundi, Lnn. epigastrici craniales, Ln. femoralis lateralis, Ln. prefemoralis, Lnn. intestinales, Lnn. sacrales laterales, Ln. mediastinalis ventralis, Lnn. mediastinales dorsales and Ln. diaphragmaticus, as lymph nodes in the cat, are herein described {{for the first time}} on the basis of the writers' observations. Furthermore, in 13 groups (^* mark) some revisions have become necessary in detailed descriptions. 2. Each group of lymph nodes was placed in either the constant (100 %), nearly constant (less than 100 %, over 80 %) or inconstant (less than 80 %) group determined by that occurrence ratio. The inconstant group, it showed a specific feature in that it consists of small nodes, generally less than 6 mm in the longest diameter. 3. In regard to the numbers of lymph nodes, some remarkable individual variations were noted in the abdominal cavity only, but not in other areas. No definite variations were found by sexes or between the right and left sides of the body. 4. The afferent and efferent lymphatic vessels of the above groups of lymph nodes have been described in the writers' series of reports. 5. In addition, three kinds of specific lymph streams were distinguished and discussed, as follows : 1) The branch lymph streams of the thoracic <b>duct</b> and jugular <b>trunks</b> were detected in some cases. Some branches of the thoracic duct passed through Lnn. mediastinales craniales, Lnn. tracheobronchiales craniales dextri, as has already been stated in respect to the cat. The writers, furthermore, found for the first time some branches of the thoracic duct which passed through Lnn. mediastinales dorsales, Lnn. tracheobronchiales craniales sinistri, Lnn. tracheobronchiales caudales and Ln. infraclacicularis, and some branches of the jugular trunk which passed through Lnn. anguli brachiocephalici. In the thoracic duct of the cat, the network formation surrounded Aa. intercostales in all cases. 2) Some peripheral lymphatic vessels, originating from the trachea, esophagus, thyroid gland, thymus, diaphragm, costal pleura, testis and ovary, empty directly into the jugular <b>trunk,</b> thoracic <b>duct,</b> lumbar <b>trunk</b> or cisterna chyli without the lymph passing through a node and then pour into the venous angles. The appearance of such lymphatic vessels is related intimately with the degree of occurrence of the special fixed nodes in accordance with the peripheral areas of their origin. It was suggested that such lymphatic vessels maintain an undifferentiated state without developing any appropriate node. 3) The writers found lymphatic communications by which lymph streams reversely among lymph nodes. The communications are divided into three types as follows : type A-connection by which lymph is able to stream reversely through a valveless-like vessel; type B-connection whose lymphatic vessels with single flowing direction alternate with each other among nodes; type C-connection by lymphatic networks with valves at various places. To the matter of this finding, no attention has been paid particularly until now. The occurrences of such communications are more numerous in the body surface than those in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. From the obtained results and from consideration of the development of the lymphatics, it seems that such communications derive from a remainder of a lymphatic plexus which appeared in the course of the developmental process. The third type is C, an original form, which may be changed from type B to type A, a more advanced one. A lymph stream by way of such communications among nodes may flow from the periphery towards the body center in the normal living state. But if the tissue pressure in the peripheral areas is made higher by some conditions, such flow can clearly be reversed. The three kinds of specific lymph vessels should be noted in pathology and physiology to act as a specific pathway of the lymph. 6. The writers divided lymph nodes into three types of Z, T and ZT, and made macroscopic observations with considerations of the structural differences among the nodes of each type. The node of type Z receives only peripheral lymph, that of type T receives only lymph which has passed through other nodes and that of type ZT receives both sorts of lymph. The occurrences of each type differed among the groups of lymph nodes which were determined by their locations. As a rule, no definite differences were macroscopically detected between types Z and ZT, but only type T showed a specific feature; type T is small node, approximately 1 mm in diameter, which does not join into groups at a definite position but appears as an accessory one accompanying types Z and ZT without exception. 7. From the ratio of occurrences, types classified by appearances of afferent vessels and sizes of lymph nodes, the writers suggest, at least, that there is something of structural difference among nodes of 3 groups as follows : 1. nodes of types Z and ZT in the writers' constant and nearly constant groups, 2. nodes of types Z and ZT in the writers' inconstant group, 3. nodes of type T, without falling into groups classified with relation to their ratio of occurrence. The suggestion should be followed up by microscopical observations. 8. In this observation, Neoprene latex was used in an attempt to find whether it was applicable for demonstration of lymphatic vessels. Neoprene latex is within the range of possibility of use as an injection material for comparatively larger vessels, but more advanced study is necessary before it can be recommended for injection into the peripheral lymphatic vessels...|$|R
