The Iranian was a double agent and handed over the information to Iranian intelligence. This also has been denied by an intelligence official.

50|$|While we have {{no illusions}} about how a Kerry {{administration}} would govern — absent mass pressure from below — and are not impressed with his delayed criticism {{of the war and}} his earlier commitments in favor of 'free trade,' we also realize <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> as reactionary as Reagan’s. A Kerry defeat would be taken not as a defeat of the US political center, which Kerry represents, but of the mainstream Left. As a result, it would embolden the Right and demoralize the Left (as well as trade unionists and people of color) as much as Reagan’s 1984 defeat of Mondale did. On the other hand, a Kerry victory will let us press onward, with progressives aggressively pressuring an administration that owed its victory to democratic mobilization from below.|$|E

40|$|A {{new report}} in the Washington Post says that in 2003 members of the Bush {{administration}} continued to say that Iraq had a WMD program, citing mobile units purportedly for making biological weapons, even after they had received a report from on-site experts to the contrary. A poll conducted last month by WorldPublicOpinion. org finds that seven in ten Americans perceive the Bush administration as still saying that Iraq had a major WMD program or actual WMD.

The palpable hue and cry against such an idea {{is easy to understand}} since it overturns a policy that traditionally has guided U. S. thinking on addressing weapons of mass destruction (WMD) proliferation. For decades the United States chose to rely on multilateral control regimes and diplomatic or economic pressures against states seeking to acquire WMD. Indeed, one notable exception to this policy has been the effort undertaken by both Republican and Democratic administrations over the last decade to use military force to slow or destroy Iraq's efforts to acquire nuclear, chemical and biological weapons...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} section of this paper, I will discuss the {{promotion}} of democracy as part of U. S. grand strategy in the Post-Cold War era. I will present different and conflicting scholarly opinions regarding the role of democracy promotion and the sort of priority that it should hold for U. S. foreign policy. In the last eight years, the Clinton administration has adopted a strategy that most closely resembles the model of Cooperative Security, although turning in the direction of Primacy, a direction <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> likely to follow. I will use the frame that I have developed about the priority of democracy promotion for U. S. grand strategy, to consider U. S. -Cuban relations. Prior to the fall of the Soviet bloc, U. S. policy on Cuba was directly related to containing the threat of communism. After the Cuban revolution of 1959, the rise of Fidel Castro and his ensuing decision to declare the revolution socialist to receive Soviet [aid] were extremely threatening to the United States because it gave the Soviets a very close geographical location to the U. S. and a charismatic leader who was interested in liberating other small nations from their imperialistic governments. Therefore, the Cuban revolution was not only an ideological loss, but it became a national security threat for the United States...|$|E

40|$|Well, it {{has been}} an exiting time for the global climate change debate recently. The EU car makers {{announced}} that {{they are not going to}} be able to meet the CO 2 limits they agreed with the European Commission for 2008, never mind the not yet agreed, but much tougher limits proposed by the Commission for 2012. Soon after this ‘uncheerful’, but unsurprising news, it was announced in Washington <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> expected to abandon plans to include SUVs in a revised CAFÉ regime. This is to protect the embattled Big 3 automakers who have much to lose from such a change in regulation; much more than their Japanese competitors, in fact. The Big 3 are also still fighting the proposals by the California Air Resources Board in Sacramento to regulate on CO 2, although a similar regime in Canada has already been accepted, albeit reluctantly. Finally, in the UK, the House of Lords select committee on economic affairs published a report entitled The Economics of Climate Change, in which it is suggested that the science underlying the Kyoto Protocol may have erred on the side of the negative implications of global warming. The report suggests the science has been somewhat biased for political reasons and that the possible positive results of climate change have been underplayed. This is a significant move as it puts their lordships in the same camp as the self-styled, and much reviled, ‘sceptical environmentalist’, Bjørn Lomborg. The Danish academic may find himself in the mainstream yet...|$|E
40|$|A {{joint report}} by Labor Council for Latin American Advancement and Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch. The Labor Council for Latin American Advancement (LCLAA) and Public Citizen {{celebrate}} {{the promise of}} increased interaction and cross-border cooperation among different nationalities on pressing global concerns. This {{is why we are}} concerned about the current model of corporate globalization being fostered by "free trade" agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Negotiated behind closed doors by unelected and largely unaccountable bureaucrats who represent mainly business interests, these trade agreements invariably fail to promote equitable regional integration and cooperation. Instead, this model of corporate globalization explicitly benefits large multinational corporations at the expense of workers, farmers, immigrants, women, people of color, the environment and democratic governance. As the fastest-growing sector of the U. S. population, Latinos are {{and will continue to be}} among the groups most affected by this model of corporate globalization. Whether newcomers from El Salvador or fifth-generation Mexican-Americans, U. S. Latinos are seeing adverse effects on their job security, health and environment. Many are immigrants who left their homelands due to the economic and social devastation caused by the current globalization model. In both the United States and in their countries of origin, Latinos have seen their environment and their livelihoods harmed by the status quo globalization package of free trade, investment and finance liberalization, new protections for foreign investors and intellectual property, and new powers that enable multinational corporations to attack state, local and federal public interest laws. In this report, we examine the impact of NAFTA on Latino communities throughout the United States. Implemented in 1994, NAFTA is the most fully realized version of the corporate globalization model. It is currently being used as the blueprint for other trade and investment agreements <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>is</b> pushing in the hemisphere, such as the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and an array of bilateral free trade agreements with the Andean countries (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru) and Panama. Although we support trade, we feel that NAFTA is not the model to follow and should not be copied in these agreements...|$|E
