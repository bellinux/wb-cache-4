5|$|Soon {{after the}} bat's {{discovery}} in the 1970s, some roosting sites became disturbed {{as a result}} of tourism, scientific collection, and even the collection and sale of individuals as souvenirs. However, <b>these</b> <b>pressures</b> may not have had a significant effect on the species as a whole, since many small colonies exist in hard-to-access locations, and only a few major caves were disturbed. Another potential risk is the activity of local monks, who have occupied roost caves during periods of meditation.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, {{the diamond}} {{stingray}} {{is one of}} the most important components of Pacific artisanal shark and ray fisheries, comprising around a tenth of the total annual catch. Its significance is likely underestimated, as Mexican fishery reports frequently suffer from misidentifications and a lack of species-specific data. It is mainly caught during summer and fall, being the most common ray landed in Bahía Magdalena, and second most common ray landed off Sonora state. Demersal gillnets are the main fishing gear employed; both adult and juvenile rays easily become entangled in the mesh by their tail spines, with juveniles known to have comprised most of the Bahía Magdalena catch in 19982000. This species is also often caught incidentally in bottom trawls, on longlines, and in fish traps. In the future, habitat degradation from increasing numbers of shrimp farms may pose an additional threat to this species in the region. As a result of <b>these</b> <b>pressures,</b> the IUCN has assessed the diamond stingray as Near Threatened in Mexican waters. No management schemes have yet been enacted for this species.|$|E
5|$|This {{curtailment}} of governors' {{powers as}} the Emperors' representatives may have lessened the political dangers of an all-too-powerful class of Imperial delegates, {{but it also}} severely limited governors' ability to oppose local landed elites, specially those of senatorial status, which, although with reduced opportunities for office holding, retained wealth, social prestige, and personal connections. – specially in relatively peaceful regions without a great military presence. On one occasion, Diocletian had to exhort a proconsul of Africa not to fear the consequences of treading on the toes of the local magnates of senatorial rank. If a governor of senatorial rank himself felt <b>these</b> <b>pressures,</b> one can imagine the difficulties faced by a mere praeses. That accounts for the strained relationship between the central power and local elites: sometime during 303, an attempted military sedition in Seleucia Pieria and Antioch made Diocletian to extract a bloody retribution on both cities by putting to death a number of their council members for failing their duties of keeping order in their jurisdiction.|$|E

40|$|During {{investigations}} {{of the effects of}} sym-pathomimetic amines on ventricular function in normal dogs, significant pressure gradients were observed frequently across the right ven-tricular outflow tract. The magnitude of <b>these</b> <b>pressure</b> gradients was greatest in anesthetized animals infused with isopropylarterenol. Since no detailed description of such functional right ventricular outflow-tract pressure gradients was found in the literature, studies on the occurrence and mechanism of this phenome-non were initiated. These experiments demonstrated that infu-sions of isopropylarterenol induce pressure gradients, which are largest in late systole, be-tween the sinus of the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery; that the magnitude of <b>these</b> <b>pressure</b> gradients always is increased by the prior administration of either acetyl strophanthidin or calcium chloride, and that the genesis of <b>these</b> <b>pressure</b> gradients appar-ently depends on early vigorous contraction of the infundibulum of the right ventricle...|$|R

25|$|The Reformation {{occurred}} {{later in}} Britain {{than in most}} of mainland Europe.

Various types of gun drills also use similar arrangements.|$|E
25|$|Preying on {{demersal}} {{bony fishes}} and crustaceans, the speartooth shark is adapted for hunting in near-complete darkness.

25|$|The {{goal of a}} trafficker is to turn a {{human being}} into a slave.

Traffickers may hold their victims captive, expose them to large amounts of alcohol or use drugs, keep them in isolation, or withhold food or sleep. During this time the victim often begins to feel the onset of depression, guilt and self-blame, anger and rage, and sleep disturbances, PTSD, numbing, and extreme stress.

25|$|The {{shape of}} the nozzle is important. Consider a balloon {{propelled}} by air {{coming out of a}} tapering nozzle. In such a case the combination of air pressure and viscous friction is such that the nozzle does not push the balloon but is pulled by it. Using a convergent/divergent nozzle gives more force since the exhaust also presses on it as it expands outwards, roughly doubling the total force. If propellant gas is continuously added to the chamber then <b>these</b> <b>pressures</b> can be maintained for as long as propellant remains.

25|$|As a side effect, <b>these</b> <b>pressures</b> on {{the rocket}} also {{act on the}} exhaust in the {{opposite}} direction and accelerate this exhaust to very high speeds (according to Newton's Third Law). From the principle of conservation of momentum the speed of the exhaust of a rocket determines how much momentum increase is created for a given amount of propellant. This is called the rocket's specific impulse. Because a rocket, propellant and exhaust in flight, without any external perturbations, may be considered as a closed system, the total momentum is always constant. Therefore, the faster the net speed of the exhaust in one direction, the greater the speed of the rocket can achieve {{in the opposite direction}}. This is especially true since the rocket body's mass is typically far lower than the final total exhaust mass.|$|E

The end of the war found the zoo in a state of slight disrepair and depletion of stocks, but in good condition considering the conflict of the last six years. Furthermore, this time saw the retirement, and movement of many of the early or original members of the zoo staff.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacities}} and demands {{model has been}} proposed {{to account for the}} heterogeneity of the disorder. In this approach, speech performance varies depending on the capacity that the individual has for producing fluent speech, and the demands placed upon the person by the speaking situation. Capacity for fluent speech may be affected by a predisposition to the disorder, auditory processing or motor speech deficits, and cognitive or affective issues. Demands may be increased by internal factors such as lack of confidence or self esteem or inadequate language skills or external factors such as peer pressure, time pressure, stressful speaking situations, insistence on perfect speech, and the like. In stuttering, the severity of the disorder is seen as likely to increase when demands placed on the person's speech and language system exceed their capacity to deal with <b>these</b> <b>pressures.</b> However, the precise nature of the capacity or incapacity has not been delineated.|$|E
