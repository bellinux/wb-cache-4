25|$|That you say as {{a theologian}} that I am a universalist is evident, {{in the sense}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Jesus was sent into the world to save the sinners that we all are. This is what I {{understand}} Saint Paul to say when he mentions that sin has entered the world through one man, Adam, and spread to all men, and that he calls Jesus the second Adam through Whom redemption entered the world for all men, and even as he says 'all of creation,' that the redemption of Christ is the victory of God over the Fall. I believe that this great plan of salvation is universal, concerns not only all men but the universality {{of the world and}} that Jesus on the Cross has accomplished this Salvation, this reconciliation of men with God, that the 'chastisement' as Isaiah says is fallen upon Him to free men from the malediction of the Fall. This plan of God therefore seems to be collective, global, universal.|$|E

2500|$|In an August 27, 2006, {{appearance}} on Meet the Press, Novak {{was asked if}} indeed Armitage was his source of Mrs. Wilson's identity as a CIA operative. Novak responded: [...] "I told Mr. Isikoff... that I do not identify my sources on any subject if they're on a confidential basis until they identify themselves... I'm going to say one thing, though, I haven't said before. And that is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the time has way passed for my source to identify himself." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My motive in {{desiring}} {{to become}} acquainted with Mr Keswick," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "is one you could scarcely understand, and all I can say about it is, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> knew the gentleman who had formerly been the accepted lover of a lady, I should better know the lady." ...|$|R

I {{did my best}} to {{find out}} his family, but had no idea of ever seeing the man himself, for the simple reason <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> he died twenty years ago. He had sailed in a vessel that was {{reported}} as lost with all hands, so you may well imagine my surprise when he told me who he was." ...|$|R
2500|$|There {{are among}} them {{a few things that}} are not {{completely}} worthless. The music is a bit infantile, plain, spirited; but in the end, the people, our Spanish people, are something of all <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the people are right when they continue to be moved by Córdoba, Mallorca, by the copla of the Sevillanas, by the Serenata, and Granada. In all of them I now note that there is less musical science, less of the grand idea, but more color, sunlight, flavor of olives. That music of youth, with its little sins and absurdities that almost point out the sentimental affectation ... appears to me like the carvings in the Alhambra, those peculiar arabesques that say nothing with their turns and shapes, but which are like the air, like the sun, like the blackbirds or like the nightingales of its gardens. They are more valuable than all else of Moorish Spain, which though we may not like it, is the true Spain.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2017 BFI London Film Festival, Guadagnino {{stated that}} he was open {{to the idea of}} a sequel in 2020, {{suggesting}} it might be in the style of Richard Linklater's Before trilogy, whilst telling the story of Oliver and Elio as they aged. [...] "If I paired the age of Elio in the film with the age of Timothée, in three years’ time, Timothée will be 25, as would Elio by the time the second story was set," [...] he said. In the novel, Elio and Oliver reunited 15 years later, when Oliver is married. Guadagnino said that Elio probably wouldn’t be gay in the potential sequel: [...] "I don’t think Elio is necessarily going to become a gay man. He hasn’t found his place yet. I can tell you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he would start an intense relationship with Marzia [...] again.” Guadagnino is also interested in the politics of the 1990s, saying [...] "it would be the beginning of the Berlusconi era in Italy and it would mean dealing with the war of Iraq.” ...|$|E

"Well, Anne, as I say, I cannot {{withstand}} you, {{since it}} was your mother who requested Lady Oglethorpe's patronage for you, though I tell you sincerely <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> had the two courses been set before her she would have chosen the safer and more private one.|$|E

6000|$|S. [...] "Then it seems, {{from what}} has been agreed, that it is {{indifferent}} {{to the spirit of}} truth, whether it speak truth or not. The spirit seems to be of an enviable serenity.

6000|$|... 'Why,' said Captain Charteris, 'I hardly know.

'And I may add <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> as you say, you did not desire actually to win the prize by underhand means. But I cannot overlook such an offence. It is serious.

"I should think," [...] Jonas suggested, [...] "that Isaac {{should go}} back, and break it to them, first, that I have returned; that I {{have been a}} slave among the Romans, and have escaped from them.

We did not exchange many words, for he was greatly disturbed in spirit at the wounding of his old servant, and the scene he had gone through; and, seeing {{that he and his wife}} would rather be alone with their patient, I left almost directly after Dr. Hodges went away. However, I may say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> there are private matters in the affair, which he will probably himself communicate to you." ...|$|E

6000|$|But mind, I do {{not mean}} to say that, in past or present {{relations}} between Ireland and England, you have been wrong, and we right. Far from <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> in all great questions of principle, and in all details of administration of law, you have been usually right, and we wrong; sometimes in misunderstanding you, sometimes in resolute iniquity to you. Nevertheless, in all disputes between states, though the strongest is nearly always mainly in the wrong, the weaker is often so in a minor degree; and I think we sometimes admit the possibility of our being in error, and you never do.[237] ...|$|E

I do not say that I am free from anxiety myself, but my confidence in Netta's cleverness, and I may say prudence, is such <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the risk she is running is very slight.

I need not say that I know little of the real disposition of your two nephews. Frank behaved to me with the greatest kindness when I was a poor cripple without the slightest claim upon him. Fred has behaved kindly and courteously, although I have come between him and you.

6000|$|... [Sidenote: King Mark betrays Sir Tristram to a promise] King Mark said: [...] "I {{have listened}} to your singing for this long while {{concerning}} the Lady Belle Isoult.

For because of your songs and ballads I have come to love her so greatly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I shall have no happiness in life until I have her for my Queen.

60|$|And {{now what}} remains {{for me to}} tell? Her nose was Grecian, but perhaps a little too wide at the nostril to be {{considered}} perfect in its chiselling. Her hair was soft and brown,--that dark brown which by some lights is almost black; {{but she was not}} a girl whose loveliness depended much upon her hair. With some women it is their great charm,--Neæras who love to sit half sleeping in the shade,--but it is a charm that possesses no powerful eloquence. All beauty of a high order should speak, and Madeline's beauty was ever speaking. And now that I have said <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I have told all that may be necessary to place her outward form before the inward eyes of my readers.|$|E

And, Philippa, for one part of my adventure, the part which concerns you, it was a gorgeous prelude, and for the other--well, it just does not count because I have no fear. I have faith in my fortune, do you know <b>that?</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I shall leave this place unharmed, but I believe that if I leave it without you, I shall go back to the worst hell in which a man could ever..." ...|$|E
