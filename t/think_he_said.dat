25|$|Wales is an atheist. In an {{interview}} with Big <b>Think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> his personal philosophy is firmly rooted in reason {{and he is a}} complete non-believer. , he lives in London, England.|$|E
25|$|The focus {{therefore}} {{shifted to}} a separate individual born at the same time, in a neighbouring stable. When Jesus appears in the film (first, as a baby in the stable, {{and then later on}} the Mount, speaking the Beatitudes), he is played straight (by actor Kenneth Colley) and portrayed with respect. The comedy begins when members of the crowd mishear his statements of peace, love, and tolerance ("I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'Blessed are the cheesemakers'").|$|E
2500|$|He {{said that}} he would safely and conscientiously trust him with a {{considerable}} trust in government, but I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> it with a little hesitation. It is clear that he is not quite at ease about him, tho' as far as I can see determined not to abandon him. ... The combat in his mind between the candid interpretation of his friend's actions, and his own conviction deprives him of half the benefit of his understanding.|$|E
6000|$|Harper nodded. “There’s {{not much}} you don’t <b>think</b> of,” <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> “Still, {{it seems to}} me quite likely that Maccario can’t get through.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> perhaps,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'we {{had better}} all be {{thinking}} of going to bed.' And he smiled with a feeble and deprecatory smile.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, don't you <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> changed?' <b>said</b> Mrs. Heep. 'There I must umbly beg {{leave to}} differ from you. Don't {{you see a}} {{thinness}} in him?' ...|$|R
2500|$|The Pythons {{unanimously}} {{deny that}} they were ever out to destroy people's faith. On the DVD audio commentary, they contend that the film is heretical because it lampoons the practices of modern organised religion, but {{that it does not}} blasphemously lampoon the God that Christians and Jews worship. When Jesus does appear in the film (on the Mount, speaking the Beatitudes), he is played straight (by actor Kenneth Colley) and portrayed with respect. The music and lighting make it clear that there is a genuine aura around him. The comedy begins when members of the crowd mishear his statements of peace, love and tolerance ("I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'blessed are the cheese makers'"). Importantly, he is distinct from the character of Brian, which is also evident in the scene where an annoying and ungrateful ex-leper pesters Brian for money, while moaning that since Jesus cured him, he has lost his source of income in the begging trade (referring to Jesus as a [...] "bloody do-gooder").|$|E
2500|$|Political historians still {{debate whether}} Kennedy {{could have won}} the Democratic {{nomination}} had he lived. Some historians, such as Theodore H. White and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., have argued that Kennedy's broad appeal and famed charisma would have convinced the party bosses at the Democratic Convention {{to give him the}} nomination. Jack Newfield, author of RFK: A Memoir, stated in a 1998 interview that on the night he was assassinated, [...] " [...] had a phone conversation with Mayor Daley of Chicago, and Mayor Daley all but promised to throw the Illinois delegates to Bobby at the convention in August 1968. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to me, and Pete Hamill, 'Daley is the ball game, and I think we have Daley. However, other writers such as Tom Wicker, who covered the Kennedy campaign for The New York Times, believe that Humphrey's large lead in delegate votes from non-primary states, combined with Senator McCarthy's refusal to quit the race, would have prevented Kennedy from ever winning a majority at the Democratic Convention, and that Humphrey would have been the Democratic nominee even if Kennedy had lived. The journalist Richard Reeves and historian Michael Beschloss have both written that Humphrey was the likely nominee, and future Democratic National Committee chairman Larry O'Brien wrote in his memoirs that Kennedy's chances of winning the nomination had been slim, even after his win in California.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{called to}} inquire {{yesterday}} morning. I am not sure,' said the exact little boy, 'but I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he met papa in the steamer.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I don’t {{know if this}} is {{the right}} thing, but it’s all I can <b>think</b> of,” <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> “We want to keep down any {{internal}} bleeding.” ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Caryll {{continued}} to watch him, in silence, and--as an observer might have thought, as, indeed, Gaskell did <b>think,</b> though <b>he</b> <b>said</b> nothing at the time--with wicked relish.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I rayther <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is,' <b>said</b> the imperturbable Sam; 'and I {{hope this}} here reverend gen'l'm'n 'll excuse me saying that I wish I was THE Weller as owns you, mother-in-law.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was a {{young man}} in the {{carriage}} with me," [...] he asked presently. [...] "Mr. Gerald something or other I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> his name was?" ...|$|E
6000|$|John Paul {{was brought}} up, and the Junior Lord of the Admiralty looked him over {{from head to}} toe. And what, my dears, do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to him? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Little? Jim {{told me she}} was tall; regal, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> In fact, he's {{enthusiastic}} about her; and that makes me curious, because Jim's taste is not often bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was talking}} very loudly, and I thought some of Lord Arthur's friends {{up in the}} {{pavilion}} must have heard. He thought so, too, I <b>think,</b> for <b>he</b> <b>said</b> quickly: ...|$|R
6000|$|Somerset was {{a little}} {{surprised}} at the avowal: the minister's words on the effects of her new environment recurred to his mind. 'Miss De Stancy doesn't <b>think</b> so,' <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> 'She cares nothing about those things.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is,' <b>said</b> Constance; 'it {{seems to}} me that Stanhope leads him into that betting, and makes him think it does not signify whether he passes or not, and so he does not take pains.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Analysed sounds," [...] I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> but I am not sure. He {{glanced at}} the window. [...] "Have {{you ever seen a}} curtain before a window fixed in that way before?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he did {{not quite}} believe it;" [...] {{and then she was}} forced, much against her will, to {{describe}} to her betrothed how Owen had boldly claimed her as his own.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Palmer will be {{so happy}} to see you," [...] said she; [...] "What do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> when he heard of your coming with Mama? I forget what it was now, but it was {{something}} so droll!" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Mr. Smith has the {{engaging}} {{quality of}} hitting hard without making personal {{charges against the}} integrity and motives of those who <b>think</b> differently. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> many things that made the House gasp, and many that made it laugh..." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lin Shaohua: He {{declared}} that men should avoid housework, as {{pots and pans}} are fatal to men. [...] "They wear out a man’s thinking and spirit—that’s the reason why there are effeminate men," [...] and <b>thinks</b> what <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was totally right.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was,' <b>said</b> {{the young}} woman. 'In fact, I {{think you are}} a funny lot, toll-gate woman and all. Now here is a quarter; please take the toll and give me the change, that is, {{if you know how}} to calculate.' ...|$|R
60|$|A {{great number}} of my uncle's sonnets, he said, were written from the 'Cat and Salutation,' or a public-house with some such name, in Smithfield, where my uncle imprisoned himself for some time; and they {{appeared}} in a newspaper, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> the Morning Chronicle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] {{said the}} boy quietly. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> something, but I've {{forgotten}} it. But it was mighty good of him to come, for I thought, you know, {{that he did not}} care to see me after Heavy Tree, and that he'd gone back on us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> so," [...] {{the czar}} replied. [...] "He simply said that I could perform an {{amputation}} {{as well as}} he could, which was not quite true. But I studied surgery for a time in Holland, and performed several operations under the eyes of the surgeons there.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No fool!--I should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> isn't, indeed,' <b>said</b> Cytherea, {{looking up}} from the paper in quite an excitement: 'to write such verses as these!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course {{my mother}} <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> did," [...] <b>said</b> John, {{going back to}} his book. [...] "It is {{impossible}} that she should think otherwise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has been,' <b>said</b> she, smiling. 'There is some {{difference}} {{between you and}} the boyish young deacon that came here two years ago.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that Harmac {{would come}} to Mur and settle his account with the Abati, and that the foreign men {{would be wise to}} fly fast and far. That's all I understood; ask me no more, who would not return into that cave to be made a prince." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{it right}} to judge so hastily?" [...] she inquired, {{mastering}} her indignation with difficulty. [...] "The poor man may not be fit for hard work--I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> so--and I cannot help growing wrathful at times when I hear the stories which reach me of commercial avarice and tyranny." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Old Bakenkhonsu told me, Prince, that he {{had been}} present at many royal betrothals, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> eleven, and had never seen one {{conducted}} with more grace. He added that the way in which you kissed the brow of her Highness was perfect, as was all your demeanour after the first argument." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If you <b>think</b> we're wax-works,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'you {{ought to}} pay, you know. Wax-works weren't {{made to be}} looked at for nothing, nohow!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, yes, I <b>think</b> you would,' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> more kindly; 'but your {{indifference}} for so many, {{many years}} {{has made me}} doubt it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She answered: [...] "Philip Dunboyne <b>thinks</b> so. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> to me, 'I {{resist the}} temptation because I might be wanting in respect if I gave way to it. But I should like to follow her when she goes out--merely for the {{pleasure}} of seeing her walk.'" ...|$|R
