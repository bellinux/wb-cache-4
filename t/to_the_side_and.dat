5|$|It {{was only}} a brief return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> two months later Rhodes joined Conference National side Woking on loan {{for the rest of}} the season. His debut for Woking came two days later in the club's 1–1 draw with Wrexham, with Rhodes being {{substituted}} towards the end of the second half by Joel Ledgister. He played three games for Woking, scoring one goal. Rhodes returned to Rotherham but was released by the club having played 18games and scoring four goals during his one season stay.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Burns {{was given}} a {{prolonged}} run in the Warwickshire team, playing both first-class and one-day cricket throughout April and May; he failed to impress during these matches, recording a highest score of 35 and averaging well under twenty in both forms of the game. He {{spent the rest of}} the season playing for the second team. Some strong performances for the seconds at the start of the 1996 season, including scores of 77 and 81 not out in a match against the Marylebone Cricket Club Young Cricketers, and a finger injury suffered by Piper, saw him regain a place in the Warwickshire first team in June. He remained in the first team for the rest of the season, playing as a specialist batsman when Piper returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> scored three half-centuries in first-class cricket, including his highest first-class score to that point, 81 runs scored against Nottinghamshire, during a match in which he also remained 65 not out in the second innings.|$|E

5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have {{calves and}} ankles that return and amplify the energy {{supplied}} by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E
5|$|Players {{take control}} of Nier—a middle-aged man in Nier and Nier Gestalt and a teenaged boy in Nier Replicant—though the {{character}} can be renamed by the player. The player directly controls Nier through a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies throughout the game. The player can also turn the camera around the characters, which allows for a 360° view of the surroundings. The three-dimensional world is divided into areas separated by loading screens, and the player can move freely throughout these areas by walking, running, jumping, and climbing ladders. In some rooms and buildings, the camera swings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> Nier is restricted to moving as in a two-dimensional platforming environment, while during certain battles the camera pulls up to simulate a top-down shoot 'em up or other video game genres.|$|E
5|$|The large orbit {{was shaped}} like an {{imperfect}} ellipse (with the longest axis {{from front to}} back), and faced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> slightly forward. The infratemporal fenestra (opening) behind the eye was narrow and sloped backwards, and the supratemporal fenestra on the top back of the skull was very reduced in size, due to the thickening of the frontoparietal. The basicranium (back part) of the skull was shortened and distanced from the regions below the orbits and around the palate. The occiput sloped backwards and down, and the occipital condyle was deflected in the same direction. The lacrimal bone formed the lower front margin of the orbit, and its surface had rows of node-like ornamentation. The prefrontal and palpebral bones were fused and formed a thick ridge above the orbit. The relatively large jugal bone formed the lower margin of the orbit, extending far forwards and down towards the jaw joint. It was ornamented with ridges and nodes in a radiating arrangement.|$|E

5|$|Jones {{started the}} 2011–12 season well scoring against Norwich City and twice against FC Thun in the UEFA Europa League. With Stoke signing Peter Crouch {{at the end}} of August, Jones found himself out of favour and was {{restricted}} to cup and European matches. This has led to speculation that Jones could be leaving the club in the 2012 January transfer window but Pulis insists that he is still in his plans. He scored an historic goal for Stoke against Dynamo Kyiv to earn them a 1–1 draw which secured Stoke's qualification to the knock-out stage of the Europa League. In 2012–13 Jones remained behind Crouch in Pulis' starting line-up restricting him to cameo appearances off the bench. He regained his place in December 2012 after injury to Crouch and scored his first Premier League goal for sixteen months in a 1–1 draw with Everton. Jones continued his revival scoring against Liverpool on boxing day, and against his old club Southampton on 29 December. Jones lost his place once Crouch had returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> he ended the season on a sour note as he was involved in a dressing room bust-up with Glenn Whelan. At {{the end of the season}} Tony Pulis was replaced by Mark Hughes and Jones was critical of the style of football played under Pulis.|$|E

25|$|Most male {{birds have}} no phallus. In the males of species without a phallus, sperm {{is stored in}} the seminal glomera within the cloacal {{protuberance}} prior to copulation. During copulation, the female moves her tail <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> the male either mounts the female from behind or in front (as in the stitchbird), or moves very close to her. The cloacae then touch, so that the sperm can enter the female's reproductive tract. This can happen very fast, sometimes in {{less than half a}} second.|$|E
