5|$|Eager to {{add another}} {{franchise}} player to their team, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> heavily pursued free agent center Dwight Howard in the 2013 offseason. He officially signed with <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> on July 13, 2013. Led by the new inside-out combination of Howard and James Harden, and with a strong supporting cast including Chandler Parsons, Jeremy Lin, and Ömer Aşık, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> were expected to jump into title contention in the upcoming season. However, in the post-season, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> were defeated {{in the first round}} by the Portland Trail Blazers, losing the series 4–2. Still, in the 2014–15 season, without Lin and Parsons but reinforced by Trevor Ariza, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> started the season well, winning the first four games of the season {{for the first time since}} 1996–97, and winning each of their first six games by 10 points or more, the first team to accomplish this feat since the 1985–86 Denver Nuggets. While <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> had many key players miss time throughout the entire season, James Harden took it upon himself to keep <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> near the top of the conference, turning him into an MVP front-runner. He became the first Rocket to score 50 points in a game since Hakeem Olajuwon, as well as the only player in franchise history to record multiple 50 point games in a season. On April 15, 2015, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> beat the Jazz to claim their first ever Southwest Division title and first Division crown since 1994, and by completing 56 wins finished with the third-best regular season record in franchise history. During the playoffs, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> beat the Mavericks 4–1 in the first round, and overcame a 3–1 deficit against the Los Angeles Clippers to win the Western Semifinals and return to the Conference Finals for the first time in 18 years. In the Conference Finals, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> were defeated by the Golden State Warriors 4–1.|$|E
40|$|To {{achieve an}} {{accurate}} rocket launch, {{it is necessary}} to assess how the perturbations appearing when <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> leaves <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> launcher system, influence <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> flight trajectory and shooting accuracy as well. Therefore, we will analyze the influence of <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> launcher system oscillations, during the shooting, on <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> movement. We are taking into account other perturbation factors that can appear during the shooting and <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> flight in standard atmosphere.

50|$|The {{short drive}} shaft {{operated}} the pivot clamp around <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> midsection, which could move <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> 28 mm (~1") forward or backward along its centreline. <b>The</b> <b>rocket</b> midsection was {{fitted with a}} band which included trunnion pins placed in opposition; the pivot clamp held <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> by <b>the</b> trunnion pins. The pivot clamp was able to rock on a transverse shaft, thus causing <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> to move along its centreline. After erection of <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> to a vertical position, it was held suspended above the launch table; by use of the pivot clamp, the weight of <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> could be gently lowered onto the launch table until fully taken up, allowing <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> to be unsecured from the lifting frame, thus dismounting it from the Meillerwagen.|$|R
5000|$|At launch, a valve {{released}} the gaseous CO2 to expel <b>the</b> <b>rocket.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> left <b>the</b> launch tube, the plug in <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> nozzle dropped off, allowing <b>the</b> <b>rocket's</b> fins {{to be deployed}} and the propellent charge to be released through the nozzle. The propellent discharge lasted about two seconds, giving <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> a velocity of about 550fps (167 meters per second) and about 75g's acceleration for a [...]75 lbs payload.|$|R
5|$|Eager to {{add another}} {{franchise}} player to their team, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> heavily pursued free agent center Dwight Howard in the 2013 offseason. On July 5, 2013, Howard announced via his Twitter account {{that he intended to}} sign with the Houston Rockets after the July moratorium period ended. The NBA fined <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> $150,000 for talking about Howard during this moratorium period. Dwight Howard officially signed with <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> on July 13, 2013.

5|$|In 1968, after <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> won a coin toss {{against the}} Baltimore Bullets to {{determine}} who would have the first overall pick in the 1968 NBA Draft, they selected Elvin Hayes from the University of Houston. Hayes led the team to the franchise's first ever playoff appearance in 1969, but <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> lost in the semi-finals of the Western Division to the Atlanta Hawks, four games to two. In 1970 NBA Draft, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> drafted Calvin Murphy and Rudy Tomjanovich, who would both spend their whole careers with <b>the</b> <b>Rockets.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rockets</b> drafted Patrick Patterson of Kentucky {{with the}} 14th {{pick in the}} 2010 NBA Draft. On July 15, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> signed free agent Brad Miller.

50|$|Disposal {{operations}} for the M55 are made more difficult because of <b>the</b> <b>rocket's</b> design. <b>The</b> <b>rocket</b> propellant was a double base composition nitroglycerin (NG) and nitrocellulose (NC) propellant. Besides the NG and NC, M28 contains 2-nitrodiphenylamine (NDPA) as a stabilizer. <b>The</b> <b>rocket</b> propellant cannot {{be removed from the}} warhead without cutting open <b>the</b> <b>rocket.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rockets</b> have {{developed}} many rivalries within the Western Conference {{ever since the}} team returned there in 1980. Two are intrastate rivalries, with the San Antonio Spurs, who moved along with <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> after four years {{with them in the}} Eastern Conference, and the Dallas Mavericks, introduced that very season. Houston faced both Texas teams in playoffs since 1980, beating the Spurs three times and losing once. <b>The</b> <b>Rockets</b> lost twice to the Mavericks, while beating them once. Other famed rivalries were with the Los Angeles Lakers, who in the 1980s Showtime era only missed the NBA Finals when beaten by <b>the</b> <b>Rockets,</b> and the Utah Jazz, who <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> beat in both championship seasons but were defeated by Utah in five other occasions.|$|E
5|$|After {{a disappointing}} season, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> {{had to make}} some {{significant}} changes to their roster. Howard wasn't happy with his role and the team overall still lacked an identity. On June 1, 2016, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> named Mike D'Antoni as their new head coach. Howard opted out of {{the final year of}} his contract later in June, and signed with the Atlanta Hawks in July. With Howard gone, Harden was now the undisputed franchise player. Harden reaffirmed his commitment to the franchise when he signed a four-year, $118.1 million contract extension in July. <b>The</b> <b>Rockets</b> also signed Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon, two perimeter players who complemented Harden and fit D'Antoni's style of play.|$|E
5|$|By the All-Star {{break in}} February 2011, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> were 26-31. On February 24, 2011, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> traded Shane Battier to the Memphis Grizzlies for Hasheem Thabeet and a first round pick. They also traded Aaron Brooks to the Phoenix Suns for Goran Dragić and a first round pick. Afterwards the team won 15 games out of 20, {{reaching}} {{a winning record}} and contending for a playoff spot. The team entered April with chances of qualifying for the postseason, but {{for the second straight}} season <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> failed to make the playoffs after losing to the New Orleans Hornets in Louisiana with three games remaining. The team still finished the year with a 43-39 winning record. Head coach Rick Adelman left <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> right after the season.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rocket</b> is {{equipped}} with an onboard computer to help correct the horizontal and vertical deviations. During the first three seconds of <b>the</b> <b>rocket’s</b> flight, <b>the</b> onboard computer detects the horizontal difference between the programmed trajectory and actual status of <b>the</b> <b>rocket,</b> and controls <b>the</b> <b>rocket’s</b> stabilising thrust system to correct <b>the</b> <b>rocket’s</b> flying direction. <b>The</b> onboard computer corrects the vertical deviation by adjusting the warhead detonation time so that the submunitions are spread with a high accuracy.|$|R
50|$|The diagram {{illustrates}} three cases. <b>The</b> middle <b>rocket</b> shows <b>the</b> straight-line {{flight configuration}} {{in which the}} direction of thrust is along the center line of <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> and through <b>the</b> center of gravity of <b>the</b> <b>rocket.</b> On <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> at <b>the</b> left, the nozzle has been deflected {{to the left and}} the thrust line is now inclined to <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> center line at an angle called the gimbal angle. Since the thrust no longer passes through the center of gravity, a torque is generated about the center of gravity and the nose of <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> turns to <b>the</b> left. If the nozzle is gimballed back along the center line, <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> will move to the left. On <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> at <b>the</b> right, the nozzle has been deflected to the right and the nose is moved to the right.|$|R
40|$|A commercially {{available}} water rocket {{is used to}} illustrate the idea of action and reaction applied to rocketry. Air is pumped {{into the body of}} <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> under pressure. When the air is released, the pressure within <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> forces <b>the</b> air out as exhaust. The reaction force of the exhaust air on <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> gives <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> its thrust. When a small amount of water is exhausted with the pressurized air, <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> experiences a much greater thrust, due to the greater momentum of the water in the exhaust. Clearly, neither the pressure alone nor the energy stored in <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> alone is responsible for this phenomenon...|$|R
5|$|Chaney {{was named}} the Coach of the Year for the 1990–91 season, after leading <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> to a 52-30 record despite Olajuwon's absence due to injury for 25 games. <b>The</b> <b>Rockets</b> were once again {{eliminated}} {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, 3–0 to the Lakers. Midway through the next season, with the Rockets' record only 26–26, Chaney was fired and replaced by one of his assistants, former Houston player Tomjanovich. Although <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> did not make the playoffs, in the next year, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> won-loss record improved by 13 games, as they won 55 games. Olajuwon won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award, and <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> clinched the Midwest title. The playoffs started with Houston's first series victory in 5 years by defeating the Los Angeles Clippers, before an elimination by the SuperSonics during a game 7 overtime loss in one of the classic postseason series in NBA History.|$|E
5|$|Drexler {{retired after}} the season, and <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> traded {{to bring in}} Scottie Pippen to take his place. In the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> lost to the Lakers {{in the first round}} of the playoffs. After the 1999 draft, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> traded for the second overall pick Steve Francis from the Vancouver Grizzlies, in {{exchange}} for four players and a first-round draft pick. However, after Houston traded a discontented Pippen to Portland, and Barkley suffered a career-ending injury, the rebuilt Rockets went 34–48 and missed the playoffs, for only the second time in 15 years.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} decade, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> rehauled their roster and were again contenders for the NBA title. In the 2014–15 NBA season, led by head coach Kevin McHale and guard James Harden, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> won their first {{division}} title in 21 years, {{and reached the}} Western Conference Finals {{for the first time}} since 1997.|$|E

5|$|Following Jordan's departure, the Houston Rockets, led by Hakeem Olajuwon, won the 1994 and 1995 NBA titles. During this period, Olajuwon {{became the}} only player in history to win the NBA MVP, NBA Defensive Player of the Year and Finals MVP awards in the same season. That was the only year that both the NBA and NHL finals went to seven games while {{involving}} teams from the same city, with <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> facing the New York Knicks in 1994. With their win in Game 7, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> denied New York from winning both the NBA and NHL titles in the same year, as the New York Rangers won the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals. After trading for Drexler midseason, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> later swept an Orlando Magic team consisting of Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway in the 1995 Finals; Olajuwon was again named Finals MVP, and <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> became the fifth franchise to win back-to-back titles {{and became the first}} 6th-seeded team to win the title without enjoying home court advantage on any of their playoff series.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a season}} of ups-and-downs with injury and form, Jeremy Lin {{was traded to the}} Lakers on July 13, 2014. That same day, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> {{declined}} to match the three-year, $46 million offer sheet that Chandler Parsons received from the Mavericks, and to compensate for his departure, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> agreed to bring back Trevor Ariza on a four-year, $32 million deal in free agency.
