5|$|Civilian A-10: Proposed by <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> School of Mines and Technology {{to replace}} its North American T-28 Trojan {{thunderstorm}} penetration aircraft. The A-10 would have its military engines, avionics, and oxygen system replaced by civilian versions. The engines and airframe would receive protection from hail, and the GAU-8 Avenger {{would be replaced}} with ballast or scientific instruments.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the National Science Foundation granted $11 {{million to}} modify an A-10 for weather {{research}} for CIRPAS at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School and {{in collaboration with}} scientists from <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> School of Mines & Technology (SDSM), replacing SDSM's retired North American T-28 Trojan.

5|$|The Great Plains cover most of {{the western}} two-thirds of South Dakota. West of the Missouri River the {{landscape}} becomes more rugged and consists of rolling hills, plains, ravines, and steep flat-topped hills called buttes. These buttes sometimes rise 400 to 600feet (120 to 180m) above the plains. In the south, east of the Black Hills, lie <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> Badlands.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture has {{historically}} been {{a key component of}} <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> economy. Although other industries have expanded rapidly in recent decades, agricultural production is still very important to the state's economy, especially in rural areas. The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle, corn (maize), soybeans, wheat, and hogs. Agriculture-related industries such as meat packing and ethanol production also have a considerable economic impact on the state. South Dakota {{is one of the largest}} producers of ethanol in the nation.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{was one of}} four fast battleships of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> {{class to}} be {{authorized}} for construction by the United States Congress in 1938. Her keel was laid down on 20 July 1939 at the Fore River Shipyard of Quincy, Massachusetts.

5|$|A {{prototype}} Mark 2 {{was tested}} and proven on 8 April 1918, {{and the gun}} was scheduled to go into naval service in 1923. However, with the cancellation of both the Lexington and <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> classes, no guns were installed on any ships even though 71 had been built and 44 were under construction. In 1922–24, twenty of the guns {{were given to the}} Army for use as coastal defense guns along with the Army's 16"/50 caliber M1919 guns. Later planning called for the use of these guns in the s, but miscommunication between design bureaus led to the 16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun being used instead. As a result, all but three of the Navy's remaining Mark 2 and 3 guns were sent to the Army to also be used as coastal defense guns.|$|E
5|$|After {{his single}} season at Reedley, McCarty {{transferred}} to Western Washington University and played football for the Vikings. McCarty was immediately {{a significant factor}} in the Vikings' gameplan. In the season opener, he rushed for 139 yards and three touchdowns on 30 carries against the Humboldt State Lumberjacks. He also played a large role in the passing game early in the season, making eight receptions for 126 yards through the first two games. After starting the first seven games for the Vikings, McCarty broke his foot in a game against <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> Hardrockers. At the time of his injury, he led the Vikings in rushing and receiving yards. He finished the season with 492 rushing yards and five touchdowns on 130 carries, as well as 30 receptions for 278 yards. McCarty was also named a second-team all-star of the North Central Conference.|$|E

5|$|Construction work on Alabama, {{the fourth}} and final member of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> class, began on 1 February 1940 in the Norfolk Navy Yard with the keel laying. She was {{launched}} on 16 February 1942 and commissioned into service six months later, on 16 August. Alabama sailed on her shakedown cruise from the Chesapeake Bay on 11 November, which culminated in Casco Bay, Maine. Minor repairs were carried out in Norfolk, after which the big ship returned to Casco Bay to conduct training maneuvers with her sister, South Dakota. Beginning in March 1943, Alabama {{was assigned to the}} British Home Fleet, and tasked with convoy escort duties on the route to the Soviet Union. She was relieved of these duties in July so that she could return to Norfolk for a brief overhaul in August.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to higher}} {{elevation}} and precipitation, {{the ecology of}} the Black Hills differs significantly from that of the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by coniferous needleleaf evergreens: various types of pines—including ponderosa (covering , or 80% of the Black Hills forest), lodgepole, white, and timber—as well as western red cedar and spruces. Western yellow ponderosa is the most important lumber tree in the area. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> state tree is the Black Hills spruce. The Red Valley is home to blue-joint and bluegrasses, and wild plum, Juneberry, and chokecherry shrubs grow in the Hills. Violets, thistles, and horse mint are prevalent herbs. Vines grow widely: the woodbine, bittersweet, and wild grape, which is the pattern for Black Hills gold jewelry.|$|E
5|$|As of 2005, South Dakota has {{the lowest}} per capita total state tax rate in the United States. The state does not levy {{personal}} or corporate income taxes, inheritance taxes, or taxes on intangible personal property. The state sales tax rate is 4.5 percent. Various localities have local levies so in some areas the rate is 6 percent. The state sales tax {{does not apply to}} sales to Indians on Indian reservations, but many reservations have a compact with the state. Businesses on the reservation collect the tax and the state refunds to the Indian Tribes the percentage of sales tax collections relating to the ratio of Indian population to total population in the county or area affected. Ad valorem property taxes are local taxes and are a large source of funding for school systems, counties, municipalities and other local government units. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> Special Tax Division regulates some taxes including cigarette and alcohol-related taxes.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{additional}} displacement, the General Board was incredulous that a tonnage increase of 10000 LT would allow only {{the addition of}} 6 kns over <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakotas.</b> Rather than retaining the 16-inch/45 caliber Mark 6 guns used in <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakotas,</b> they ordered that future studies would have to include the more powerful (but heavier) 16-inch/50 caliber Mark 2 guns {{left over from the}} canceled s and [...] battleships of the early 1920s.

5|$|On 26 July 1954, a {{conversion}} {{proposal for the}} South Dakota-class ships was ordered by the Chairman of the Ship Characteristics Board. The request was made for the ships' speed to be increased to at least 31 knots. To do so, the design staff decided to remove the after turret and use the weight and space gained to install either a set of improved steam turbines or a set of gas turbines. Either system would have to produce at least 256,000shaft horsepower (190 MW)—the minimum requirement to achieve 31knots on <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> hull. Unfortunately, this would have necessitated alterations to the hull form, particularly {{in the rear of}} the ship. Larger propellers were also required, and all four shafts would have had to have been completely rebuilt to accommodate the changes. Estimates for the project ran as high as $40,000,000 per ship, and this did not include the cost of reactivating the ship and upgrades to its electrical and combat systems. As a result, the conversion program was halted.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2008, the brigade's combat service/combat {{sustainment}} support battalions took part in equipment testing and training in Rapid City, South Dakota. It tested the Multifunction Agile Remote Control Robot IV, a route clearance robot, {{with the assistance of}} <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> National Guard. The bulk of the brigade spent the summer at Fort Sill, Oklahoma to train aviation assets for deploying units. In June 2008, the brigade trained the aviation assets of the 34th Infantry Division in air combat, air assault, and other tactics related to aviation. For this mission, the brigade was assisted by the 479th Field Artillery Brigade, which handled ground exercises. As part of a new training routine, the brigade trained the 34th Infantry Division's aviation units at Fort Rucker, spending a longer time training the unit because it continued to train the brigade as it mobilized and prepared to deploy. Other units trained with the Division, but none through the entire mobilization process. This process used new and never-before-used facilities to streamline training exercises. Purportedly, it gave the 166th Aviation Brigade much additional time for training, as the streamlining process made some programs more efficient, cutting time needed to prepare for them in half.|$|E
