5|$|Meth {{mouth is}} very {{difficult}} to treat unless the patient stops using methamphetamine; persistent drug use makes changes in hygiene or nutrition practices unlikely. Many drug users lack access to dental treatment, and few are willing to participate in such a course of action, often because of poverty. Those who are willing to seek dental treatment often resist discussing <b>their</b> <b>drug</b> use. Providing dental treatment to individuals who use methamphetamine can also be dangerous, because the potential combination of local anesthetic and methamphetamine can cause serious heart problems. There is also an increased risk of serious side effects if opioid medications are used in the patient's treatment.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of the men}} who {{purchased}} {{sex with}} Falle were police officers, and she knew girls who used drugs with <b>their</b> <b>drug</b> counselors. Falle was brainwashed to believe that her only worth lay in prostitution, which she later said was why it took her so long to exit prostitution. While engaging in prostitution, Falle was frequently threatened by other women in the sex industry, she was verbally abused by her clients, she was stalked, and she was threatened with guns on multiple occasions, including by her pimp. She was also drugged several times, and was once sexually assaulted by an escort driver after having been drugged by him. At one point, she was kidnapped. She had to resort to pulling a knife on people at times when she was threatened with violence. Because of various instances of violence during her time in prostitution, Falle was injured in a variety of ways. Her pimp broke several of her bones and burned her body.|$|E

40|$|One hundred {{patients}} whose hypertension was originally well controlled were carefully screened when a routine clinic visit showed that {{their blood pressure}} was above 170 / 100 mm Hg.

Eleven patients were using racemic alpha-methyldopa, which was ineffective; 11 others said they could not afford the drugs; only three intentionally stopped <b>their</b> <b>drugs</b> because of unpleasant side effects. Patients need to be thoroughly informed about their treatment and the number of drugs kept to a minimum...|$|R
5|$|One {{day before}} senior year, Veronica is working {{a job at}} a {{restaurant}}. Soon, a boy named Kelvin (Charles Duckworth) comes into the restaurant and says that he failed his drug test, even though he has been clean for ten months. Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face. Although he woke up with a knife and found one of the gang members was stabbed, Logan tells Veronica that he did not stab the gang member, and Veronica believes him. However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed <b>their</b> <b>drug</b> test. Wallace informs Veronica about the details of the drug test, and the episode flashes back to show the details of Veronica and Logan starting to date over the summer. Veronica talks to all the students who were framed in the drug test, and they all say some people might want to harm them. Veronica has become estranged from Meg, and Veronica reveals that Logan was released from prison soon after he was arrested.|$|E

25|$|The {{security}} policy of Peña Nieto has prioritized {{the reduction of}} violence rather than attacking Mexico's drug-trafficking organizations head-on, marking {{a departure from the}} strategy of the previous six years during Felipe Calderón's administration. One of the biggest contrasts is the focus on lowering murder rates, kidnappings, and extortions, as opposed to arresting or killing the country's most-wanted drug lords and intercepting <b>their</b> <b>drug</b> shipments. The government of Calderón justified its position by stating that the violence in the country was a necessary stage in Mexico's drug war, as weakening criminal groups fought for territorial control against one another and the government.|$|E

25|$|Although over 85 {{percent of}} the {{population}} use an insurance system to reimburse <b>their</b> <b>drug</b> expenses, the government heavily subsidizes pharmaceutical production/importation in order to increase affordability of medicines, which tends also to increase overconsumption, overprescription and misuse of drugs, much like the abuse of pharmaceutical opioids in Iran such as the heavily prescribed codeine for moderate to severe pain. The regulatory environment of the country is rather strict on the import of drugs and pharmaceuticals towards companies that intend to enter into the market for the first time. The Ministry of Health and Medical Education is the main stakeholder of pharmaceutical affairs in the country.|$|E

Furthermore, many traffickers believe they {{have a better chance}} of surviving a firefight than the outcome of any legal proceedings. In China, sentencing for drug trafficking could include capital punishment. For example, the seizure of 50grams or more of heroin or crystal methamphetamine could result in the use of the death penalty by the Government.|$|E
