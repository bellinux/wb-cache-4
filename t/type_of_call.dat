25|$|As {{opposed to}} screech owls, scops owls {{have only a}} single <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>call.</b> This {{consists}} {{of a series of}} whistles or high-pitched hoots, given with a frequency of 4 calls per second or less, or of a single, drawn-out whistle. Calls differ widely between species in type and pitch, and in the field are often the first indication of these birds' presence, as well as the most reliable means to distinguish between species. Some, like the recently described Serendib scops owl (Otus thilohoffmanni), were discovered because their vocalizations were unfamiliar to experts in bird-calls.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the typical}} {{cotton-top}} tamarin communicative vocalizations, the combination long call (CLC) and the alarm call (AC) {{are the most}} heavily represented in the literature. CLCs encompass a range of contact calls that are produced by isolated individuals using chirps and whistles. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> is also used for seemingly altruistic alarm calls, thus adding to its range of cooperative behaviors. It is issued {{in the presence of}} kin when a threatening llamas predator is seen. Predators of the cotton-top tamarin include snakes, ocelots, tayras, and most notably, hawks. Early observations by Patricia Neyman even showed that cotton-tops produce diverse sets of alarm calls that can discriminate the presence of birds of prey versus ground-based predators.|$|E

According to an estimate by the Conference Board of Canada, it generates $140 million in economic activity, $65 million in taxes and 3,000 direct and indirect jobs. For the past few years however, the town has been working to attract more technical industries with mayor Dan Mathieson spearheading the effort. The Royal Bank of Canada opened a $300 million data centre here, Starwood Hotels is experimenting with a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> centre, and the University of Waterloo has opened a satellite campus with about 500 students specializing in digital media and information technology, and as the home of the technology forum Canada 3.0 and various technology companies.|$|E

2500|$|Right {{whales in}} other oceans have been {{recorded}} making a percussive vocalization labeled a [...] "gunshot call" [...] or gunshot. The role and purpose of this call is uncertain. However, until 2017, {{it had never been}} proven than it was right whales in the North Pacific that were the whales making this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>call,</b> so detection of gunshots was not considered a reliable indicator of the presence of right whales.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cotton-top}} tamarin vocalizes with bird-like whistles, soft chirping sounds, high-pitched trilling, and staccato calls. Researchers describe its repertoire of 38 distinct sounds as unusually sophisticated, conforming to grammatical rules. Jayne Cleveland and Charles Snowdon performed an in-depth feature analysis to classify the cotton-top's repertoire of vocalizations in 1982. They {{concluded that it}} uses a simple grammar consisting of eight phonetic variations of short, frequency-modulated [...] "chirps"—each representing varying messages—and five longer constant frequency [...] "whistles". They hypothesize {{that some of these}} calls demonstrate that the {{cotton-top tamarin}} uses phonetic syntax, while other calls may be exemplars of lexical syntax usage. Each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> is given a letter signifier; for example, C-calls are associated with finding food and D-calls are associated with eating. Further, these calls can be modified to better deliver information relevant to auditory localization in call-recipients. Using this range of vocalizations, the adults may be able to communicate with one another about intention, thought processes, and emotion, including curiosity, fear, dismay, playfulness, warnings, joy, and calls to young.|$|E
