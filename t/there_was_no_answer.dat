25|$|Based on {{cell phone}} usage, police believe the killings {{took place on}} the evening of September 11. A call was placed at 8:54p.m. from Weissman's cell phone to Gerry's Italian Kitchen, a Watertown restaurant, for {{delivery}} of three dinner entrees. When a delivery woman arrived at 9:14p.m., <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> at the door, and no one answered when the restaurant called Weissman's cell phone.|$|E
25|$|On 29 January 1889, Franz Joseph and Elisabeth gave {{a family}} dinner party prior to leaving for Buda, in Hungary, on 31 January; Rudolf excused himself, {{claiming}} to be indisposed. He had arranged for a day's shooting at Mayerling early {{on the morning of}} the 30th, but when his valet Loschek went to call him, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer.</b> Count Joseph Hoyos, the Archduke's hunting companion, joined in, with no response. They tried to force the door, but it would not give. Finally Loschek smashed in a panel with an axe to find the room shuttered and half-dark. Rudolf was found sitting (by some accounts, lying) motionless by the side of the bed, leaning forward and bleeding from the mouth. Before him on the bedside table stood a glass and a mirror. Without closer examination in the poor light, Loschek assumed that the crown prince had drunk poison from the glass, since he knew strychnine caused bleeding. On the bed lay the body of Mary Vetsera, white, ice-cold, and already quite rigid. The mistaken impression that poison was involved, and even that the baroness had poisoned the crown prince and then killed herself, would persist for some time.|$|E
500|$|Wilson, Borrow and the 35 others {{made for}} Lobengula's enclosure. The king's wagon was still there, but when Wilson called to him, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer.</b> The king {{had moved on}} during the night. At that moment, the troopers {{heard the sound of}} rifles being cocked in the wood {{surrounding}} them. A Matabele inDuna stepped out from behind a tree and announced that the enclosure was surrounded by thousands of Matabele who wanted to [...] "see if the white men were afraid to die." [...] He then fired his rifle to signal the start of the attack to his men. A volley from the Matabele riflemen followed, but most of the shots went too high; no Company trooper was hit. The only casualties of this opening volley were two of the patrol's horses. Wilson immediately ordered his men to fall back, first to an antheap, then to a thick wood. Three of them were wounded during this retreat, but none fatally.|$|E

2500|$|Earlier that week, Clough, as a {{television}} pundit, memorably called Poland goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski a [...] "circus clown in gloves" [...] before the crucial World Cup qualifier with England at Wembley. The match, which England had to win, ended 1–1, mostly thanks to Tomaszewski's heroics. When commentator Brian Moore said [...] "You call him a clown, Brian, but he saved his side", Clough replied [...] "Would you want him in your team every week?", to which <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E

Later Alice B. Toklas was buried {{alongside}} her. According to the famous version of her last moments, before having been taken into surgery, Stein asked her partner Toklas: [...] "What is the answer?" [...] After Toklas replied to Stein that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer,</b> Stein countered by sinking back into her bed, murmuring: [...] "Then, there is no question!" ...|$|E
2500|$|After being unopposed in the 2016 Republican primary, Price faced Democratic {{challenger}} Rodney Stooksbury in {{the general}} election. Stooksbury, {{said to be a}} retired aeronautic, was described by the media as a [...] "ghost candidate", as he had no public photographs, official website, or social media presence. When CBS46 sent a reporter to his listed address, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer,</b> and Stooksbury's supposed neighbors had never heard of him. The Stooksbury campaign spent a mere $346. Despite the handicap of possibly not existing, Stooksbury performed better than any of his predecessors - Price won the election, but only carried 61% of the vote.|$|E

Quietly and gradually there came out of the mist of thought this answer clear and strong, [...] "Let this body – this symbol of him – be carried reverently over the sea to his native land".

2500|$|According to Canadian {{government}} submissions in a Federal Court case, Abousfian was interrogated by two Canadian Security Intelligence Service agents {{while in}} Sudanese detention, {{under threat of}} torture and without charge. Canadian official Sean Robertson ordered Canadian ambassadorial staff to not attempt to monitor the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) interrogation, after Abdelrazik had requested that they accompany him to the interrogation. At the interrogation, the FBI threatened that he would [...] "never return to Canada" [...] {{if he did not}} agree to work with them. Embassy staff compromised with Abdelrazik and told him they would phone him immediately after the scheduled interrogation was over, but when they called, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer.</b> Meanwhile, however, assurances were being given to Canadian Parliament that he was receiving full consular protection.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of Tuesday, March 18, Effie went to check on Joan after the doctor had left for the day. [...] She found Joan in a soiled nightgown; when she moved her to help her change into a fresh gown, Effie saw that Joan had been lying in dried feces. [...] Two towels had been placed under her due to a recent loose bowel {{movement}} that appeared to contain blood. The maid {{did her best to}} help Joan into the bathroom to clean her. [...] As she did this, Effie noticed that Joan's face began turning blue. [...] The maid hurriedly cleaned up Joan and the soiled bed and called to her husband, who also worked for the Hills, to phone Mrs. Hill's parents' home at once. When <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer,</b> Archie Green tried unsuccessfully to reach John Hill at his office and left a message. [...] Rhea Robinson was unaware of Joan's condition when her husband dropped her off at the Hill home to visit her daughter.|$|E

2500|$|Former girlfriend Kym Wilson and her then-boyfriend, Andrew Reyment, {{were the}} last people to see Hutchence alive when they left him at 4:50am; he was still {{awaiting}} {{a phone call from}} Yates in London concerning whether she would bring their daughter Tiger to Australia. Hutchence's second last outgoing phone call was to his personal manager, Martha Troup's voice-mail, [...] "Marth, Michael here. I've fucking had enough." [...] When Troup returned the call <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer.</b> At 9:54am he talked to his former longtime girlfriend, Michèle Bennett, who stated that he was crying, sounded upset and said he needed to see her. Bennett arrived at his door at about 10:40am, but there was no response. Hutchence's body was discovered by a hotel maid at 11:50am. Police reported that, [...] "He was in a kneeling position facing the door. He had used his snake skin belt to tie a knot on the automatic door closure {{at the top of the}} door, and had strained his head forward into the loop so hard that the buckle had broken." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his villa in Rapallo, Sibelius wrote: [...] "Don Juan. I {{was sitting}} in the dark in my castle when a {{stranger}} entered. I asked who he could be again and again — but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer.</b> I tried to make him laugh but he remained silent. At last the stranger began to sing — then Don Juan knew who it was. It was death." [...] On the same piece of paper, he wrote the bassoon theme for the [...] first part of the second movement, out of which a pizzicatoed string [...] "walking bass" [...] stems. Two months later in Florence, he drafted the second theme, with a note reading [...] "Christus," [...] perhaps symbolizing the death and resurrection of the movement, or even of Finland. Scholars also suggest that Sibelius modeled the second movement after Dante's Divine Comedy. Nonetheless, Robert Kajanus said that the movement [...] "strikes one as the most broken-hearted protest against all the injustice that threatens at the present time to deprive the sun of its light and our flowers of their scent." [...] The movement culminates with a towering, brassy theme, following by an ethereal, mist-like motif in the divided strings.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} few years, Bader made himself a thorn {{in the side of}} the Germans. He often practised what the RAF {{personnel}} called [...] "goon-baiting". He considered it his duty to cause as much trouble to the enemy as possible, much of which included escape attempts. He made so many escape attempts that the Germans threatened to take away his legs. In August 1942, Bader escaped with Johnny Palmer and three others from the camp at Stalag Luft III B in Sagan. Unluckily, a Luftwaffe officer of Jagdgeschwader 26 was in the area. Keen to meet the Tangmere wing leader, he dropped by to see Bader, but when he knocked on his door, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer.</b> Soon the alarm was raised, and a few days later, Bader was recaptured. During the escape attempt, the Germans produced a poster of Bader and Palmer asking for information. It described Bader's disability and said he [...] "walks well with stick". Twenty years later, Bader was sent a copy of it by a Belgian civilian prisoner, who had worked in a Gestapo office in Leipzig. Bader found this amusing, as he had never used a stick. He was finally dispatched to the [...] "escape-proof" [...] Colditz Castle Oflag IV-C on 18 August 1942, where he remained until 15 April 1945 when it was liberated by the First United States Army.|$|E
