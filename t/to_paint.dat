5|$|In May 1843, Etty was one {{of eight}} artists chosen by Prince Albert <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> frescoes {{on the theme of}} Milton's Comus for a new {{pavilion}} being built in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Etty was unhappy with his selection, as fresco was a medium with which he had no experience, but reluctantly did so, choosing <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> on the theme of Circe and the Sirens Three. The result was a disaster. Etty found himself unable to retouch or alter his existing work, as any freshly applied paint would flake away from the existing paint layer, and the lunette shape of the panel left Etty with a large empty space above the central figures. Etty's fresco was deemed unsalvageable, and although he offered <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> a replacement on the theme of Hesperus he was rejected, and William Dyce was commissioned <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> a replacement fresco. Etty was paid only a token £40 fee.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} Renaissance, {{painters}} such as Duccio di Buoninsegna learned <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> faces {{first with a}} green undercoat, then with pink, which gave the faces a more realistic hue. Over the centuries the pink has faded, making some of the faces look green.|$|E

5|$|For Lord Charlemont, Hogarth chose <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> the satirical Piquet, or Virtue in Danger (also {{known as}} The Lady's Last Stake, after a 1708 play by Colley Cibber), which, with echoes of Marriage à-la-Mode, shows an army officer {{offering}} an aristocratic lady {{a chance to}} recover the fortune she has just lost by gambling (with the implication that if she loses again, {{she will have to}} take him as her lover). After Grosvenor saw this painting in Hogarth's studio in 1758, he asked Hogarth <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> a picture for him as well, under the same terms.|$|E

5|$|From {{around this}} time onwards, while Etty still held to his belief {{that the purpose of}} art is to {{illustrate}} moral lessons, he began to abandon the literary, religious and mythological themes which had dominated his work. He began <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> still lifes, beginning with Pheasant and Peach (likely to be the painting now called Dead Pheasant and Fruit); in the 1840s he exhibited six in total, and painted many more. Etty was the first English painter <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> significant still lifes, which at the time were thought by the English a primarily Netherlandish form. Also for the first time, he began <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> a significant number of landscape paintings. Etty still continued <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> history paintings, but while he continued to produce highly acclaimed reworkings of his previous pictures, those works on fresh topics were generally poorly received. Etty's decline in quality can possibly be attributed in part to London art dealers; from 1835 dealer Richard Colls had become increasingly close to Etty, and by 1844 had a near-monopoly on his work. As the importance of the landed gentry to the art market declined, the new purchasers of art were industrialists; generally lacking in a classical education and with little interest in Old Masters, they preferred to buy works by then-contemporary artists such as Etty, and relied on dealers to advise them.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Hergé {{decided he}} wanted <b>to</b> <b>paint.</b> He chose Louis Van Lint, {{one of the most}} {{respected}} Belgian abstract painters at the time, whose work he liked a lot, to be his private teacher.|$|E
5|$|In June 1835, Friedrich {{suffered}} {{his first}} stroke, which {{left him with}} minor limb paralysis and greatly reduced his ability <b>to</b> <b>paint.</b> As a result, {{he was unable to}} work in oil; instead he was limited to watercolour, sepia and reworking older compositions.|$|E

5|$|In the 1860s and 1870s, despite {{evolving}} {{trends in}} Europe, especially in Paris, embracing Realism and Impressionism, the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts refused {{to change their}} approach, insisting their students should continue <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> in the preferred styles of Historicism and Neoclassicism. Among those who were increasingly frustrated by this approach were Michael Ancher, Karl Madsen and Viggo Johansen who in the early 1870s were studying at the Royal Danish Academy in Copenhagen. Madsen, who had already visited Skagen in 1871 while staying with his uncle in nearby Frederikshavn, invited Ancher to join him there in 1874, <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> the local fishermen. He became {{a friend of the}} Brøndum family who had a shop with a bar which was soon extended to become Brøndums Gastgiveri, a guest house. He was invited to their 15-year-old daughter Anna's confirmation and showed an immediate interest in her. The following year, he returned to Skagen with both Madsen and Viggo Johansen who had been strongly influenced by French Impressionism. In particular, Johansen began <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> open-air scenes combining Impressionism with Realism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1895, on the orders of the Patriarch of Karlovci, Georgije I, the Congress Board of Sremski Karlovci {{commissioned}} the young realist Paja Jovanović <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> Migration of the Serbs, intending {{for it to be}} displayed as part of the Serb pavilion. Georgije had originally approached the artist Uroš Predić, but Predić said it would take him two years to complete the painting. Jovanović assured the Patriarch that he could finish the work in eight months. The painting was one of two works that Jovanović was hired <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> for the Exhibition, the other being the Vršac triptych, which was commissioned by the Vršac city council.|$|E

In the 1980s, she was selected <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> a horse-themed plate that was given to American president Ronald Reagan who also owned a Nipper painting on canvas. In 1982, her work was displayed in the Fine Arts Pavilion at the World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee. In 2012, Nipper painted an ornament that decorated the Christmas tree at the Governor of Tennessee's mansion. Nipper was also commissioned <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> pictures for Zsa Zsa Gabor and Shania Twain.|$|E
