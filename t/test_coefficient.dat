40|$|There are a {{large number}} of methods for solving under-determined linear inverse problem. Many of them have very high time {{complexity}} for large datasets. We propose a new method called Two-Stage Sparse Representation (TSSR) to tackle this problem. We decompose the representing space of signals into two parts, the measurement dictionary and the sparsifying basis. The dictionary is designed to approximate a sub-Gaussian distribution to exploit its concentration property. We apply sparse coding to the signals on the dictionary in the first stage, and obtain the training and <b>testing</b> <b>coefficients</b> respectively. Then we design the basis to approach an identity matrix in the second stage, to acquire the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) and universality property. The <b>testing</b> <b>coefficients</b> are encoded over the basis and the final representing coefficients are obtained. We verify that the projection of <b>testing</b> <b>coefficients</b> onto the basis is a good approximation of the signal onto the representing space. Since the projection is conducted on a much sparser space, the runtime is greatly reduced. For concrete realization, we provide an instance for the proposed TSSR. Experiments on four biometrics databases show that TSSR is effective and efficient, comparing with several classical methods for solving linear inverse problem.

40|$|In applied measurement, {{test scores}} are usually {{transformed}} to decisions. Analogous to classical test theory, the reliability of decisions {{has been defined as}} the consistency of decisions on a test and a retest or on two parallel <b>tests.</b> <b>Coefficient</b> kappa (Cohen, 1960) is used for assessing the consistency of decisions. This coefficient has been developed for assessing agreement between nominal scales. It is argued that the coefficient is not suited for assessing consistency of decisions. Moreover, it is argued that the concept consistency of decisions is not appropriate for assessing the quality of a decision procedure. It is proposed that the concept consistency of decisions be replaced by the concept optimality of the decision procedure. Two types of optimality are distinguished. The internal optimality is the risk of the decision procedure with respect to the true score the test is measuring. The external optimality is the risk of the decision procedure with respect to an external criterion. For assessing the optimality of a decision procedure, coefficient delta (van der Linden & Mellenbergh, 1978), which can be considered a standardization of the Bayes risk or expected loss, can be used. Two loss functions are dealt with: the threshold and the linear loss functions. Assuming psychometric theory, coefficient delta for internal optimality can be computed from empirical data for both the threshold and the linear loss functions. The computation of coefficient delta for external optimality needs no assumption of psychometric theory. For six <b>tests</b> <b>coefficient</b> delta as an index for internal optimality is computed for both loss functions; the results are compared with coefficient kappa for assessing the consistency of decisions with the same tests...|$|R
