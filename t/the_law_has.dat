5|$|While Article 34 of the {{constitution}} of Luxembourg formerly required the grand duke or duchess to sanction and promulgate a new law for it to take effect, the required sanction was removed in 2008, after Grand Duke Henri informed his prime minister {{that he could not}} in good conscience assent to a bill to permit euthanasia in the country. The subsequent constitutional amendment removed the need for assent while retaining the need for the Grand Duke to promulgate new laws. The Grand-Duke's signature is still required, but does not imply assent, only promulgation (announcement that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>has</b> been enacted by Parliament). The Grand-Duke did sign the Euthanasia Act under this new constitutional arrangement.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>laws</b> <b>have</b> been criticised for {{allowing}} excessive police powers leaving scope for abuse.

25|$|Since passage, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>has</b> {{never been}} implemented, because of {{opposition}} from Presidents Clinton, Bush, Obama and Trump, who {{view it as}} a Congressional infringement on the executive branch's constitutional authority over foreign policy; they have consistently claimed the presidential waiver on national security interests.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012, Brownback did {{not include}} Kansas's sodomy law in a list of unenforced and {{outdated}} laws that the legislature should repeal. Gay rights advocates had asked his administration to recommend its repeal because <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>has</b> been unenforceable since the Supreme Court's Lawrence v. Texas decision in 2003.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, {{a person}} filed lèse-majesté charges against his brother, showing how easily the lèse-majesté law can be misused and that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>has</b> {{now become a}} {{potential}} weapon in family feuds.

25|$|The law {{was first}} {{published}} in 1784 by French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb and was essential {{to the development of the}} theory of electromagnetism. Being an inverse-square law, it is analogous to Isaac Newton's inverse-square law of universal gravitation. Coulomb's law can be used to derive Gauss's law, and vice versa. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>has</b> been tested extensively, and all observations have upheld the law's principle.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>has</b> aroused further controversy, {{given that}} in its passing through the {{chambers}} of the legislature, the mandatory seven-day period between debate and assent of the new legislation was ignored. The view among {{the part of the}} opposition that opposed the bill is that Kirchner’s government is trying to rush the law through parliament before December 2009, when the government will lose its absolute majorities in Congress.|$|E

Hokusai's picture The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife (1814), which depicts a woman having an erotic fantasy, is a well-known example. In Japanese drawings, such as hentai, pubic hair is often omitted, since {{for a long time}} the display of pubic hair was not legal.

Applicants eligible for dual citizenship are those who hold citizenship of any country in addition to the citizenship of Ghana. In these instances, all applicants are required by law to provide evidence of their Ghanaian nationality or their country of birth. Its intention was to increase immigration of skilled labour, but <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>has</b> been criticised for not giving full citizens rights as native-born citizens.|$|E
25|$|More {{than half}} of U.S. stream and river miles {{continue}} to violate water quality standards. However, since {{the passage of the}} 1972 act, the levels of pollution in the United States have experienced a dramatic decrease. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>has</b> resulted in much cleaner waterways than before the bill was passed. Agriculture, industry, communities and other sources continue to discharge waste into surface waters nationwide, and many of these waters are drinking water sources. It is argued in a 2008 paper that the Clean Water Act has made extremely positive contributions to the environment, but is in desperate need of reform to address the pollution problems that remain.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the birth}} of the modern State of Israel in 1948, the Law of Return was enacted to give any Jew the right to immigrate to Israel and become a citizen. However, due to an {{inability}} on the lawmakers to agree, the Law did not define who was a Jew, relying instead on the issue to resolve itself over time. As a result, the Law relied in form on the traditional halakhic definition. But, the absence of a definition of who is a Jew, for the purpose of <b>the</b> <b>Law,</b> <b>has</b> resulted in the divergent views of the various streams of Judaism competing for recognition.|$|E
25|$|The power {{vested in}} the {{commission}} to suo motu take up matters for discussion and submit recommendations has also worked well {{to the advantage of}} India's legal system. The history of the commission is replete with such recommendations which {{have been made in the}} wake of the hour and where <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>has</b> needed change. Further, the commission has been often returned to review its earlier reports in the wake of changed scenarios and the aptness of law in such situations. Euthanasia and related issues, in particular, has been one such area where the commission has been relook the situation at least three times, with the latest being its 196th report on the topic.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand law {{has three}} {{principal}} sources: English common law; certain statutes of the United Kingdom Parliament enacted before 1947 (notably the Bill of Rights 1689); and statutes of the Parliament of New Zealand. In interpreting common law, {{there is a}} rebuttable presumption in support of uniformity with common law as interpreted in the United Kingdom and related jurisdictions. Non-uniformity arises where the New Zealand courts consider local conditions to warrant it or where <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>has</b> been codified by New Zealand statute. The maintenance of the Privy Council in London as the {{final court of appeal}} and judges' practice of tending to follow British decisions, even though, technically, they are not bound by them, both bolstered this presumption. The Supreme Court of New Zealand, which was established by legislation in October 2003 and which replaced the Privy Council for future appeals, has continued to develop the presumption.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>has</b> met heavy {{resistance}} from students, trade unions, and left-wing activists, sparking protests in February and March 2006 (and continuing into April) {{with hundreds of}} thousands of participants in over 180 cities and towns across France. On 18 March, up to as many as 1.5 million demonstrated across France, over half of the country's 84 public universities were closed because of student blockades, and Bernard Thibault, the leader of the CGT, one of France's five major labour unions, suggested that a general strike across the country would occur if the law was not repealed. A big march was prepared for 4 April, while students' organizations had already called for a general strike. In the biggest student movement since 1968, mass meetings were held in many universities (In Toulouse over 4,000 students occupied the rugby stadium to hold their meeting). Motorways were blockaded and employers organisations offices were occupied. The actions were (unusually) supported by all of the main trade union federations and all the Left political parties (more or less enthusiastically). The protests spread to high schools, and involved large numbers of young people both from prestigious universities, and from technical high schools and other places of education drawing a mainly working class student body.|$|E
500|$|The series' {{creative}} {{interpretation of}} <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>has</b> {{led to a}} misconception by the public of what real law is like (cf.

500|$|One way to {{interpret}} the clause is by the intentionalist view. As stated by University of North Carolina School of Law professor Michael J.

The commonly used term for this spirit of the law argument is [...] "net increases". According to conservative constitutional law attorney Bruce Fein, [...] "The so-called fix fits the purpose of the clause like a glove." ...|$|E
