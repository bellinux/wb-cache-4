Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe) {{disturbs}} him to say that Rudy's (Keshia Knight Pulliam) goldfish, Lamont, has died, {{but she does not}} realize it yet. They have a hard time explaining to Rudy what has happened. Once they do, Rudy becomes depressed. Later that day, <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>kids</b> start making fun of Lamont's death, Theo saying they should hold a memorial service for the fish around the family toilet. When Cliff feels {{that the rest of the}} family is insensitive to Rudy's loss, he requires the entire family to participate in a memorial service for Lamont in the bathroom in proper funeral attire. Rudy loses interest in the funeral and leaves to watch television, ending the ceremony abruptly. She later returns to the bathroom and asks for privacy, not because she wants to say goodbye to Lamont as Cliff thinks, but because she needs to use the toilet.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the singer}} has never {{mentioned}} physical abuse in her family, she had mentioned {{that her father}} was a disciplinarian and her stepmother was hard on her. Author Lucy O'Brien wrote in her book Madonna: Like an Icon that the song stemmed more from the emotional neglect that Madonna faced, with her father locked up in grief after Mrs. Ciccone died. When he married again, his new wife was wrapped up with her own children, so <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>kids</b> were often left to their own devices. O'Brien believed that for this reason, Madonna's girlhood would have been without much joy, and that [...] "Oh Father" [...] was a potent example of the singer using her imagination to escape from her troubled childhood, while blaming it on her father. Tony later said, [...] "Maybe I'm not the greatest father in the world, but life wasn't easy for us, and Nonni [...] knows all of this." ...|$|E

She said that he struggled with sports, before eventually quitting due to problems adjusting as well as being bullied.

He would leave home for school in the morning like usual, but it turned out later that he had not been in school for half a year.

2500|$|While {{there remains}} a general gap in the {{literature}} regarding the production of facial expressions and the processes which underlie this production at middle childhood and adolescence ages, research has been done to assess the overall production capabilities of children ranging in ages 5–13. Results generally indicate that the ability to produce facial emotion increases with age and is slightly correlated with the ability to discriminate the facial expressions of another. Odom and Lemond (1972) created a study to test the potential for [...] "a developmental lag between the perception and production of facial expressions," [...] meaning they were looking to uncover a relationship between previously created schemas and mental representations of different expressions and the ability to transform these representations into facial expression. They operated using the logical assumption that coding perceptions of expressions comes before the discrimination of expressions which then precedes production. Upon assessing two differing age groups, one in kindergarten and the other in fifth grade, they discovered that there is a lag between perception and production of facial expressions, however this lag does not decrease with age. Production and discrimination do not develop at the same rate. [...] Odom and Lemond (1972) have arrived at the far conclusion that production of facial expressions will never be at the same level of discrimination of facial expressions, which supports the findings of another study by Izard (1971) who found that even adults have difficulty producing requested expressions. Despite this, the increased accurate productions of <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>kids</b> was found to be due to their discrimination abilities yet the older children still made many errors leading researchers to believe that full discrimination abilities are not at full potential at the middle childhood and adolescence stage of development.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed at}} assessing liking and preference for capretto and chevon {{as a function}} of consumer familiarity with goat meat. Five meats were produced: traditional milk capretto (MC), heavy summer capretto (HSC), summering (SCh), fall (FCh) and late fall chevon (LFCh). HSC was the most tender meat, having less cooking losses than both MC and redder chevon types. The instrumental profile corresponded with the appearance and texture attributes perceived by panellists. With aging of kids, meat lost its milk aroma (MC) and sweet taste (HSC) and acquired an increasing intensity of goat flavour and livery notes, partially related to feeding regime and fatty acid profile. A niche market preferred chevon over capretto, while the cluster of consumers who were unfamiliar with chevon showed a decrease in pleasantness when tasting chevon, the familiar group reduced their ratings only for meat from <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>kids...</b>|$|R

40|$|Consumer {{acceptability}} of chevon types, {{different from the}} traditional milk capretto and available outside the Easter period, was evaluated with relationship to their intrinsic sensory properties and consumer familiarity with goat meat. Five meat types, from 38 ram kids, were evaluated: milk capretto (MC, suckling, 1 - 1. 5 months <b>old,</b> m. o., <b>kids),</b> heavy summer kid (HSK, 3 - 4 m. o. kids), summering chevon (SCh, mountain-pasture grazing, 4 - 5 m. o. kids), fall chevon (FCh, 5 - 5. 5 m. o. kids) and late fall chevon (LFCh, 5. 5 - 6 m. o. kids). HSK was the most tender meat, having less cooking losses than both MC and the most matured, redder chevon types (P≤ 0. 05). The instrumental parameters corresponded with the appearance and texture attributes perceived by panellists. In going from the young to <b>the</b> <b>old</b> ram <b>kids,</b> <b>the</b> meat lost its delicate aroma of milk (MC) and sweet taste (HSK) and acquired an increasing intensity of goat odour and flavour, together with livery notes. 104 consumers evaluated the sensory differences between meats, and their liking scores were significantly affected by familiarity. The target consumers for obtaining maximal value from chevon are those having familiarity with goat meat, because their acceptability drops only for meat from <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> ram <b>kids,</b> i. e. those close to sexual maturity...|$|R
