In particular, the contribution of any improper driver behavior or actions must be identified before (a) a program of behavior modification is recommended to authorities or (b) countermeasures are implemented to improve road safety, or both. This study attempts to identify the driver actions that contribute significantly to <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> of a crash involving at least one EV by using data from the Province of Alberta, Canada, for the period from 1999 to 2008. In addition, the impact of control variables formed from demographic, vehicle, environmental, and behavioral factors will also be explored.

40|$|Snakebites {{comprise}} a serious health problem {{in several countries}} due to their global incidence, which exceeds 2. 5 million per year, and the elevated number of victim fatalities. To counteract envenomations, antivenoms have been used regularly {{for more than a}} century. Apart from side effects including anaphylactic reactions, antivenoms are not able to efficiently neutralize local tissue damage, which contributes <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> and morbidity observed in patients. This fact, in turn, may be responsible for economic hardship, particularly in rural populations of developing countries. In the present work, we evaluated the antiophidian properties of 12 Brazilian plant extracts against the hemolytic, coagulant, hemorrhagic and proteolytic effects of Lachesis muta venom. Taken together, our data revealed that most of these aqueous products were capable of inhibiting those activities at different levels, except for Sapindus saponaria extract. In contrast, Stryphnodendron barbatiman extract completely neutralized all the analyzed biological activities. Thus, we may conclude that Brazilian flora may also be useful against L. muta accidents.

Its operations included some particularly dangerous mine shafts, sections of which were filled waist-high with water. Workers were not provided with adequate timbers for bracing and cave-ins were frequent.

5000|$|The {{resistance}} of law enforcers sometimes confounds {{the efforts of}} law makers to change social norms. Thus, as legislators expand liability for date rape, domestic violence, and drunk driving, police become less likely to arrest, prosecutors to charge, jurors to convict, and judges to sentence severely. The conspicuous {{resistance of}} these decisionmakers in turn reinforces the norms that law makers intended to change. Can this [...] "sticky norms" [...] pathology be effectively treated? It can be, if law makers apply [...] "gentle nudges" [...] rather than [...] "hard shoves". When the law embodies a relatively mild degree of condemnation, the desire of most decisionmakers to discharge their civic duties will override their reluctance to enforce a law that attacks a widespread social norm. The willingness of most decisionmakers to enforce can initiate a self-reinforcing wave of condemnation, thereby allowing lawmakers <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> {{of the law in}} the future without prompting resistance from most decisionmakers. Kahan presents a formal model of this strategy for norm reform, illustrates it with real-world examples, and identifies its normative and prescriptive implications.|$|E
50|$|Coxsackievirus shows {{a cardiac}} tropism {{partly due to}} the high {{expression}} of coxsackievirus and adenoviris receptors (CAR) in cardiomyocytes. Coxsackievirus B genome is approximately 7.4 Kb and translated as a polycistronic polyprotein. Upon translation, the polyprotein is cleaved by two essential viral proteases, 2A and 3C. The viral protease 2A cleaves the proteins in a sequence specific manner. These viral proteases can also act on host proteins exerting negative effects on the residing cell. Enteroviral protease 2A can cleave the cytoskeletal dystrophin protein in cardiomyocytes disrupting the dystrophin glycoprotein (DCG) complex. The cleavage site of dystrophin by protease 2A occurs in the hinge 3 region of the protein resulting a disruption of DCG complex and loss of sarcolemma integrity and increasing myocyte permeability. This eventually results in similar cardiac deformities observed in dilated cardiomyopathy caused by hereditary defects in dystrophin in DMD patients. Additionally, dystrophin deficiency has been shown <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> in dilated cardiomyopathy in a mouse model for DMD. The increased susceptibility of dystrophin deficient heart to coxsackievirus-induced dilated cardiomyopathy is attributed to more efficient release of the virus from infected cells resulting an increased in viral-mediated cytopathic effects.|$|E

40|$|Holidays {{are times}} of recreation, rest and {{relaxation}} to be enjoyed with our loved ones. Hence, any road traffic accidents {{and the subsequent}} deaths and injuries tend to receive more media attention and evoke stronger public reactions {{because they are more}} tragic as they turn our merriment into grief and mourning. Consequently, many jurisdictions have implemented more aggressive police enforcement and publicity campaigns targeted at reducing risky driving behaviors during the holidays. However, relatively little formal research has been conducted to specifically identify the factors contributing to crashes during holidays. Using data from 1999 - 2008, this research endeavors to identify the behavioral factors that statistically and significantly contribute to <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> of holiday crashes involving two-vehicles. In addition, the impact of different control variables formed from crash, vehicle, road surface and other behavioral factors will also be explored.

There were also cases where infections by E. jeanselmei occurred during solid organ transplants. Infections frequently cause inflammation in the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues of the skin, causing phaeomycotic cyst, chromoblastomycosis and can occasionally cause eumycetoma which is a chronic granulomatous disease {{in the form of}} black grains. Mycetoma, a common form of clinical manifestation of E. jeanselmei, is a chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease that forms abscess and draining sinuses in more advanced stages. In mycotic mycetoma, vesicles of cyst like structures are formed.

40|$|Economic {{sanction}} {{has been}} widely used and increasingly a popular tool in maintaining peace and political stability in the world. The use of economic sanction, {{as opposed to the}} use of military power, to punish target countries have been supported by the Charter of United Nations (UN).

Fifty-six elbows of 45 RA patients aged 47 to 77 years (mean age, 63 years) were tested. Muscle strength was measured with an isometric torque-cell dynamometer. Test-retest reliability of the dynamometer was proven by measuring 12 elbows of 6 healthy young men. In RA patients, elbow flexion and extension strength decreased in proportion <b>to</b> <b>increases</b> in <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> of Larsen's grades from Grade 1 to 4.

40|$|This essay {{consists}} of three chapters. Chapter one extends Allen and Gale’s (2000) model to a core-periphery network structure. We identify that the financial contagion in core-periphery structure is different to Allen and Gale (2000) in two aspects. Firstly, the shocks to the periphery bank and to the core bank have different contagion processes. Secondly, contagion not only depends {{on the amount of}} claims a bank has on a failed bank, but also on the number of links the failed neighbour has. Chapter two studies the policy effect on financial network formation when the government has time-inconsistency problem on bailing out systemically important bank. We show that if interbank deposits are guaranteed, the equilibrium network structure is different from the one under market discipline. We show that under market discipline individual banks can collectively <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> component size using interbank intermediation in order <b>to</b> <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> of systemic risk and hence trigger the bailout. If interbank intermediation is costly the equilibrium network has core-periphery structure. Chapter three follows Acharya and Yorulmazer’s (2007) study of the "too many to fail" problem in a two-bank model. They argue that {{in order to reduce the}} social losses, the financial regulator finds it ex post optimal to bail out every troubled bank if they fail together, because the acquisition of liquidated assets by other investors result in a high misallocation cost. In contrast to their paper, we argue that there is no "too many to fail" bailout, unless banking capital is costly and market price sensitive.
