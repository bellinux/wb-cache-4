In the year 2015, the A-Humans of A-Earth have created genetically engineered A-Humans capable of super intelligence and strength, as well as parasitic co-existence with machinery and animals, particularly humans. A terrorist organization known as Scarlet rose up within this race and sought to dominate the rest of the A-Humans and A-Earth by locking the planet down and keeping anyone else out. During the height of Scarlet's power, an assassination attempt on the group's leader, Epsilon-Eagle, was carried out by a special forces group. Scarlet fought back with their powers, and the battle somehow breached the space-time continuum. Epsilon was gravely injured and cast somewhere into the continuum.|$|E

The <b>text</b> <b>scroll</b> in his hand shows the words Misit me Dominus (the Lord sent me). Below him is the Tree of Jesse (the lineage leading to Christ), while above is a representation of the Trinity. It is customary for the pilgrims to touch the left foot of this statue, signifying that they have reached their destination. So many pilgrims have laid their hands on the pillar to rest, that a groove has been worn in the stone.|$|E

50|$|The game {{includes}} many parodies in its dialogue, settings, and characters. This process of parodying action games and other genres is greatly assisted {{by the fact}} that Matt Hazard is capable of breaking the fourth wall.

5000|$|Some green screen {{displays}} were {{furnished with}} a particularly full/intense phosphor coating, making the characters {{very clear and}} sharply defined (thus easy to read) but generating an afterglow-effect (sometimes called a [...] "ghost image") when the <b>text</b> <b>scrolled</b> down the screen or when a screenful of information was quickly replaced with another as in word processing page up/down operations.

40|$|AbstractWe wabted to {{determine}} whether the 2 - to 4 -fold increases in reading speed found for patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMID) when reading filtered text, presented one word at a time {{in the middle of the}} display would also be found when filtered <b>text</b> was <b>scrolled</b> across the screen. Reading speeds for filtered text that compensates for an observer's reduced contrast sensitivity function (CSF) were compared with the reading speeds for unfiltered text, when continuous, non-repeating <b>text</b> was <b>scrolled</b> across the display. The reading speeds of the ARMD observers tested were 1. 7 – 4. 5 -times faster when reading filtered text, than when reading unfiltered <b>text</b> that was <b>scrolled</b> across the screen. The largest increments, over a 4 -fold increase, were obtained in those subjects with the lowest unfiltered reading rates and the greatest loss of central vision. This study illustrates the usefulness of individualized text filtering for image enhancement in digitally based viewing devices to provide low vision remediation...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} are reported investigating oculomotor behavior and linguistic processing when reading dynamic horizontally <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> (compared to reading normal static text). Three factors known to modulate processing time in normal reading were investigated: Word length and word frequency {{were examined in}} Experiment 1, and target word predictability in Experiment 2. An analysis of global oculomotor behavior across the 2 experiments showed that participants made fewer and longer fixations when reading <b>scrolling</b> <b>text,</b> with shorter progressive and regressive saccades between these fixations. Comparisons of the linguistic manipulations showed evidence of a dissociation between word-level and sentence-level processing. Word-level processing (Experiment 1) was preserved for the dynamic <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> condition with no difference in length and frequency effects between <b>scrolling</b> and static <b>text</b> formats. However, sentence-level integration (Experiment 2) was reduced for scrolling compared to static text in that we obtained no early facilitation effect for predictable words under <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the amount}} of {{streaming}} video has grown rapidly on the Web. Often, retrieving these streaming videos offers the challenge of indexing and analyzing the media in real time because the streams must be treated as effectively infinite in length, thus precluding offline processing. Generally speaking, captions are important semantic clues for video indexing and retrieval. However, existing caption detection methods often have difficulties to make real-time detection for streaming video, and few of them concern on the differentiation of captions from scene <b>texts</b> and <b>scrolling</b> <b>texts.</b> In general, these texts have different roles in streaming video retrieval. To overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes a novel approach which explores the inter-frame correlation analysis and wavelet-domain modeling for real-time caption detection in streaming video. In our approach, the inter-frame correlation information is used to distinguish caption texts from scene <b>texts</b> and <b>scrolling</b> <b>texts.</b> Moreover, wavelet-domain Generalized Gaussian Models (GGMs) are utilized to automatically remove non-text regions from each frame and only keep caption regions for further processing. Experiment results show that our approach is able to offer real-time caption detection with high recall and low false alarm rate, and also can effectively discern caption texts from the other texts even in low resolutions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHorizontally <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> is, in theory, {{ideally suited}} to enhance viewing {{strategies}} recommended to improve reading performance under conditions of central vision loss such as macular disease, although it is largely unproven in this regard. This study investigated if the use of <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> produced an observable improvement in reading performed under conditions of eccentric viewing in an artificial scotoma paradigm. Participants (n= 17) read <b>scrolling</b> and static <b>text</b> with a central artificial scotoma controlled by an eye-tracker. There was an improvement in measures of reading accuracy, and adherence to eccentric viewing strategies with scrolling, compared to static, text. These findings illustrate {{the potential benefits of}} <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> as a potential reading aid for those with central vision loss...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Technological {{devices such}} as {{smartphones}} and tablets are widely available and increasingly used as visual aids. This study evaluated {{the use of a}} novel app for tablets (MD_evReader) developed as a reading aid for individuals with a central field loss resulting from macular degeneration. The MD_evReader app <b>scrolls</b> <b>text</b> as single lines (similar to a news ticker) and is intended to enhance reading performance using the eccentric viewing technique by both reducing the demands on the eye movement system and minimising the deleterious effects of perceptual crowding. Reading performance with <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> was compared with reading static sentences, also presented on a tablet computer. Methods: Twenty-six people with low vision (diagnosis of macular degeneration) read static or dynamic <b>text</b> (<b>scrolled</b> from right to left), presented as a single line at high contrast on a tablet device. Reading error rates and comprehension were recorded for both text formats, and the participant’s subjective experience of reading with the app was assessed using a simple questionnaire. Results: The average reading speed for static and dynamic text was not significantly different and equal to or greater than 85 words per minute. The comprehension scores for both text formats were also similar, equal to approximately 95 % correct. However, reading error rates were significantly (p= 0. 02) less for dynamic text than for static text. The participants’ questionnaire ratings of their reading experience with the MD_evReader were highly positive and indicated a preference for reading with this app compared with their usual method. Conclusions: Our data show that reading performance with <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> is at least equal to that achieved with static text and in some respects (reading error rate) is better than static text. Bespoke apps informed by an understanding of the underlying sensorimotor processes involved in a cognitive task such as reading have excellent potential as aids for people with visual impairments...|$|R
