5|$|As a freshman, Manning {{began the}} season as the third-string quarterback. In the season opener against UCLA, Manning {{was one of three}} quarterbacks <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bench after starter Jerry Colquitt {{suffered}} a season-ending injury on the seventh play of the game. However, Manning was not able to generate any offense and was pulled from the game. During the season's fourth game, against Mississippi State, starter Todd Helton got injured and Manning took over. The Vols lost 24–21, but Manning was named the team's starter and remained so {{for the rest of his}} college career. In his first start, the following week against Washington State, the Vols won 10–9. They won all but one of their remaining games, finishing the season 8–4 with a 45–23 victory over Virginia Tech in the 1994 Gator Bowl.|$|E
5|$|McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and Airbus A310-300s made {{up most of}} Biman's {{international}} fleet, {{before the}} delivery of the modern Boeing 777-300ERs started in 2011. Fokker F28s made up {{the remainder of the}} fleet for the domestic and regional sectors, before they were retired in 2012. Biman's fleet contains the second-to-last Douglas DC–10 <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> production line (l/n 445), and only three other Airbus A310–300s were produced following Biman's purchase of two new Airbus A310s in 1996. The two Fokker F28–4000s were acquired from PBair in 2004 at a cost of $2.91million. Both of these aircraft were built in 1977, making Biman's latest acquisitions the oldest aircraft in its fleet. The ageing fleet made it difficult for Biman to maintain its flight schedule, as the aircraft suffered from mechanical problems, leading to flight delays and cancellations. A number of aircraft remained grounded owing to lack of spare parts as they are no longer manufactured and used parts are difficult to source.|$|E

5|$|Parker's injury {{extended}} into {{the beginning of}} the 2015–16 NBA season. He returned to action on November 4 against the Philadelphia 76ers in the fifth game of the season for the Bucks but struggled, posting just two points in 16 minutes as a starter. As he ramped up his activity, he was rested on the second of back-to-back games. Nonetheless, after five games, he endured a sprain in his talonavicular joint in the right mid-foot causing him to be expected to miss several games. He only missed one game. The following week, he began <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bench while O. J. Mayo took his starting spot. On December 12, Parker had a 19-point, 7-rebound, 2-steal performance against the Golden State Warriors to help end their 24-game win streak. On January 27, 2016, he was named to the 2016 NBA All-Star Game weekend Rising Stars Challenge lineup. On February 19, he tied his career high with 23 points in a loss to the Charlotte Hornets. He surpassed that total the following night, recording career highs of 28 points and 13 rebounds in a 117–109 double-overtime win over the Atlanta Hawks. On February 29, Parker set a new career high with 36 points in a 128–121 Bucks victory over the Houston Rockets.|$|E
5|$|The Eighth Army telephoned Colonel Ernest V. Holmes, Chief of Staff of the 1st Cavalry Division, {{and told}} him that the 1st Cavalry Division had {{responsibility}} for the Walled City.

Holley, commanding officer of the 8th Engineer Combat Battalion, to report to Colonel Raymond D. Palmer, commanding the 8th Cavalry Regiment. That afternoon Palmer in his command post on the Tabu-dong road outlined to Holley and the commanding officers of D Company, 8th Engineer Combat Battalion, and E Company, 8th Cavalry, his attack plan to regain control of Ka-san. The Engineer company, commanded by First Lieutenant John T. Kennedy, was to lead the attack, E Company following. Once the force had gained the crest and E Company had established itself in defensive positions, the Engineer company was <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> mountain.

Others specimens may raise the first part of their bodies off the ground, flattening their necks and moving forward, tongue extended, like a small cobra. The rather frantic strikes are often combined with attempts to quickly glide away.|$|E

25|$|McHale {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bench during {{first half}} of the 1984–1985 season, but moved into a starting role in February 1985 after Cedric Maxwell suffered a knee injury.

Two nights later McHale scored 42 points against the Knicks, the only other time in his career he topped 40 points in a game. The 98 points in consecutive games is still a Celtics' record. Nine days after McHale had scored 56 points, Larry Bird established a new Celtics' single-game scoring mark by pouring in 60 points versus the Atlanta Hawks.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} {{expanded}} pilot requirements immediately preceding World War II necessitated decentralization of Air Corps flying training, {{which had been}} the core element of the program after Lahm organized the Air Corps Training Center. The ACTC was broken up geographically, establishing three regional training centers. The ACTC, still headquartered at Randolph, was renamed the Gulf Coast Air Corps Training Center and became operational in February 1941. Lahm served as its commander from October 21, 1941, to his mandatory retirement on November 20, 1941. He retired, after {{more than forty years}} of continuous military service, in the grade of brigadier general. Three weeks later, {{in the wake of the}} attack on Pearl Harbor, he offered <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> retired list but was not accepted.|$|E
25|$|However, Toronto was {{not about}} to give up on Bargnani yet and {{committed}} the entire summer coaching him to become a more effective interior player, forcing him to drive to the basket more and settle less for jump shots. The arrival of six-time NBA All-Star Jermaine O'Neal also meant that Bargnani was likely <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bench in most games, with Bosh and O'Neal forming the starting frontcourt. During the summer he worked hard on his body, putting up some more weight (adding some 15 pounds of muscle); this work showed his effects in the first games of the regular campaign, when the Italian was more willing to rebound in traffic and drive to the basket. He also seemed to rediscover his shooting stroke, had better shot selection and became a consistent shot-blocker, and he was soon moved to the starting line-up as small forward.|$|E

25|$|If {{the catch}} taken is {{pronounced}} or obvious, the players need not {{appeal to the}} umpire; the batsman normally chooses to acknowledge the dismissal himself. However, {{in the event that}} the ball brushes the edge of the bat, or the catch is taken very close to the ground, or the ball appears to have bounced off the batsman's foot (so it has not touched the ground), or the ball appearing <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bat very close to the pitch surface (bump ball), or if the batsman is reluctant to accept that he has been dismissed, the fielding team has to appeal to the umpire for this decision. In international competition, if neither field umpire can clearly decide if a catch has been made or not, they may refer to the third (television) umpire for a review. The third umpire may also be used if the Umpire Decision Review System is available and a team wishes to dispute a call concerning a possible catch.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some authors that the portrayal of Owen as a vindictive and treacherous man was fostered and encouraged by his rivals (particularly Darwin, Hooker and Huxley) and may be somewhat undeserved. In {{the first part of}} his career he was regarded rightly {{as one of the great}} scientific figures of the age. In the second part of his career his reputation slipped. This was not due solely to his underhanded dealings with colleagues; it was also due to serious errors of scientific judgement that were discovered and publicized. A fine example was his decision to classify man in a separate subclass of the Mammalia (see Man's place in nature). In this Owen had no supporters at all. Also, his unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> fence concerning evolution became increasingly damaging to his reputation as time went on. Owen continued working after his official retirement at the age of 79, but he never recovered the good opinions he had garnered in his younger days.|$|E
