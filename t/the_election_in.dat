In the 1998 general election two months later, the party lost all its seats in Parliament. This was {{as a result of the}} Centre Democrats's failure to benefit from increased attention on immigration issues, its years of internal infighting, and new legislation directed mainly against the far-right, which had raised the number of signatures per district required in order to contest elections.|$|E
