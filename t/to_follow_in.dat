5|$|Emile Durkheim {{was born}} in Épinal in Lorraine, the son of Mélanie (Isidor) and Moïse Durkheim. He came {{from a long line}} of devout French Jews; his father, grandfather, and {{great-grandfather}} had been rabbis. He began his education in a rabbinical school, but at an early age, he decided not <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>in</b> his family's footsteps and switched schools. Durkheim led a completely secular life. Much of his work was dedicated to demonstrating that religious phenomena stemmed from social rather than divine factors. While Durkheim chose not <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>in</b> the family tradition, he did not sever ties with his family or with the Jewish community. Many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, and some were blood relations. Marcel Mauss, a notable social anthropologist of the pre-war era, was his nephew. One of his nieces was Claudette (née Raphael) Bloch, a marine biologist and mother of Maurice Bloch, who became a noted anthropologist.|$|E

5|$|By 1993, Romney {{had begun}} {{thinking}} about entering politics, partly based upon Ann's urging and partly <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>in</b> his father's footsteps.
