5|$|A {{recent study}} of raven {{mitochondrial}} DNA showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations.

5|$|Although the Mellotron was {{designed}} to reproduce {{the sound of the}} original instrument, replaying a tape creates minor fluctuations in pitch (wow and flutter), and amplitude, so a note sounds slightly different each time it is played.

5|$|Although the Romans {{had a more}} hostile {{attitude}} {{than the}} Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued. The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.|$|E

The red wolf may have originated during a time of declining wolf populations in the southeastern United States, forcing a wolf-coyote hybridization as well as backcrossing with local parent coyote populations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> about 75–80% of the modern red wolf's genome is of coyote derivation.|$|E

5|$|For a long time, {{sources of}} {{nitrogen}} compounds were limited. Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions. Nitrogen fixation by industrial processes like the Frank–Caro process (1895–1899) and Haber–Bosch process (1908–1913) eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> half of global food production (see Applications) now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. At the same time, {{use of the}} Ostwald process (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock {{in the manufacture of}} explosives in the World Wars of the 20th century.|$|E

The older Gaudí ate frugally, dressed in old, worn-out suits, and neglected his appearance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> sometimes he was taken for a beggar, such as after the accident that caused his death.|$|E

His successor as archbishop subsequently had Gerard's remains moved into the cathedral church from their initial resting place beside the cathedral porch.|$|E
