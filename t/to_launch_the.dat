5|$|A {{fleet of}} 40 AEC Routemaster buses were {{purchased}} from London Transport in 1986 <b>to</b> <b>launch</b> <b>the</b> new services {{in competition with}} Strathclyde Buses. Kelvin had not previously employed conductors, but introduced them for these services. This meant the vehicles {{did not have to}} spend as long loading at bus stops as one-person operated buses and were able to offer quicker journeys through Glasgow. The Routemasters proved popular with both passengers and staff and continued to operate into the 1990s under successor company Kelvin Central, {{which was one of the}} last operators of the type in regular service in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} studies {{investigated}} sending a Gemini spacecraft onto a circumlunar trajectory. Many of the proposals made for this involved a double-launch architecture, with the Gemini spacecraft rendezvousing with an upper stage in orbit. Upper stages that were considered included the Transtage, {{the second stage of}} a Titan II, four different types of Centaur, including the S-V variant developed for the Saturn I, the Agena-D, an enlarged Agena, and two Agenas burning in parallel. Either a Titan or Saturn IB would have been used <b>to</b> <b>launch</b> <b>the</b> upper stage, whilst the Gemini would launch on the Titan II, as it had in the Gemini program.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the missile and the need for extensive testing prior <b>to</b> <b>launch,</b> <b>the</b> V-2's designers at the Peenemünde Army Research Center favoured using heavily defended fixed sites where the missiles could be stored, armed, and fuelled from an on-site LOX production plant before launching. But the German Army and the V-2 project's head, Major-General Walter Dornberger, were concerned that the sites would be vulnerable to aerial attack by the Allies. The Army's preferred option was to use Meillerwagens, mobile firing batteries, which presented a much smaller target for the Allied air forces.|$|E
