5|$|Article 20 {{provides}} {{protection from}} conviction for offences in certain respects, including the rights against {{ex post facto}} laws, double jeopardy and freedom from self-incrimination. Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> of the grounds of arrest, consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate. The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for preventive detention, subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. The provisions pertaining to preventive detention were discussed with skepticism and misgivings by the Constituent Assembly, and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949. Article 22 provides that {{when a person is}} detained under any law of preventive detention, the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any detention for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board. The person being detained also has the right <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> about the grounds of detention, and be permitted to make a representation against it, at the earliest opportunity.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech {{players and}} coaches {{attempted}} to leave the field, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> that Indiana called a timeout with one second remaining. Despite Tech head coach Frank Beamer's protests, Indiana's Manolopoulos was {{able to return to}} the field to attempt a 51-yard goal. The kick was blocked and the ball recovered by Tech's Antonio Banks, who returned it 80yards for a touchdown. The score, which came with no time remaining on the clock, gave Tech a 2813 lead at halftime.|$|E
5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in July 1940, Gens was fired from his job. He was unable to secure a work permit nor was he allowed to continue to live in Kaunas. He went to live with his brother, Solomon, in Vilnius, and although Gens was on a list to be sent to Soviet labor camps, he managed to secure an unregistered job at the Vilnius health department through an old military colleague, Colonel Juozas Ūsas. Gens was not on the official payroll, which meant that the political officer attached to the hospital did not need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> of his employment. During June 1941, when thousands of the Lithuanian elites were exiled to Siberia, Gens remained in hiding and was not deported.|$|E

5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue in a controlled manner for a couple of weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Harvey's {{account of}} the smoke-filled room had Harding being sent for {{in the early morning}} hours, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate. Harvey stated he asked if there was {{anything}} in Harding's background that might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not. Harding biographer Charles W. Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night, and that other participants denied that Harding was there. Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him.|$|E
5|$|French {{military}} planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign. After the unsuccessful American attempts of co-operation leading to failed assaults at Rhode Island and Savannah, they realised more {{active participation in}} North America was needed. However, they also needed to co-ordinate their actions with Spain, where there was potential interest in making {{an assault on the}} British stronghold of Jamaica. It turned out that the Spanish were not interested in operations agaynst Jamaica until after they had dealt with an expected British attempt to reinforce besieged Gibraltar, and merely wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> of the movements of the West Indies fleet.|$|E

5|$|The detainee is also <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> within 14 {{days of his}} or {{her right}} to make {{representations}} against the order to an advisory board, which is required to hear and consider the detainee's representations. Each advisory board is chaired by a Supreme Court judge appointed by the President, and has two other members appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief Justice. The board has the powers of a court to summon and examine witnesses, and to order that documents be produced. It evaluates the evidence and must make recommendations to the President concerning the matter within three months of the date of detention. When the advisory board recommends the release of the detainee against the Minister's decision, the President exercises personal discretion whether the detainee should be released. Before exercising his discretion, the President is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} earlier, a healthy Nalla {{took part in}} various street theatre {{performances}} protesting against multinational corporation-driven industrialisation, {{that resulted in the}} marginalisation of the labour force. He was at odds with Kandasamy Padayatchi (Nassar), a manipulative factory owner who refused to give his workers a raise. Nalla satirically imitated Padayatchi in many of his shows. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Nalla and Padayatchi's daughter Balasaraswathi, called Bala (Kiran Rathod), fell in love with each other. Realising their chances of getting together would be slim if Padayatchi knew about their relationship, Nalla and Bala decided to elope to Kerala. Nalla boarded a bus bound for Kerala, and on his way to meet Bala, the bus crashed on a hillside leaving him scarred, disfigured, and partially paralysed for life. After recovering from his wounds, he visited Bala only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> by Padayatchi that his daughter was already married and has settled abroad. Padayatchi had earlier lied to Bala that Nalla died in the accident. It was also at this time that Nalla became a firm believer in kindness and love. Despite suffering from an inferiority complex due to his scarred and deformed body, Nalla performs community service and social work with renewed fervour while continuing to fight for union causes.|$|E
5|$|After {{tying up}} Ms. Botz, the kids find all their {{telephones}} disabled (which Ms. Botz had done earlier) {{and go to}} a nearby payphone to alert the authorities. Meanwhile, Marge tries to call home to check up on the kids but because there is no answer, she and Homer decide to cancel their motel reservation and go home. They find Ms. Botz bound and gagged in front of the TV. Homer, thinking his children have gotten the best of another babysitter and unaware of her true identity, frees her and pays her handsomely. After advising Homer to keep both eyes on Bart, Ms. Botz makes a clean getaway, just seconds before the kids arrive with the police and news media to arrest her. As Bart tries to lead the police to the house, Homer attempts to berate him for his behavior towards Ms. Botz, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> by a news reporter about Ms. Botz's true identity and that he just freed her. Realizing his mistake, a humiliated Homer attempts to save face by claiming he fought Botz and she escaped, then warning her on camera never to show her face to him again. Later that night, Homer moans about his blunder on TV, but Marge cheers him up by saying that if he raised three children who can hogtie a perfect stranger, he must be doing something right.|$|E

5|$|In March 1805, the French Mediterranean Fleet sailed from Toulon under Vice-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve for an {{extended}} cruise to the West Indies, ultimately under orders to link with the French Atlantic Fleet based at Brest. Together these fleets would stage a major operation in the English Channel, driving off the Royal Navy Channel Fleet and allowing a fleet of landing barges {{to land on the}} southern coast of England as the first move in an invasion of Britain. Arriving at Martinique on 14 May, Villeneuve waited for reinforcements from the Atlantic fleet, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> on 2 June that they had failed to leave port. Despite repeated orders issued to the Atlantic fleet instructing them to sail to Martinique, Vice-Admiral Honoré Ganteaume had failed in his one effort to break out of Brest during March and then given up. His entire fleet ultimately remained in port throughout the campaign. On 7 June Villeneuve learned of the arrival in the Caribbean of the British Mediterranean Fleet under Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson and hastily sailed back to Europe, eventually sheltering in the Spanish harbour of Vigo after an encounter on 22 July with a British fleet under Sir Robert Calder at the Battle of Cape Finisterre, in which two of his ships were captured. In the aftermath of the spring campaign, both Nelson and Calder returned to Britain, leaving only relatively small squadrons off the French and Spanish coasts.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{continued}} during autumn 1938. The Soviets {{reduced their}} demands: a Red Army operation {{was not an}} option anymore and the focus was shifted on securing the Gulf of Finland. The Soviets wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> of key elements of the Finnish–Estonian Gulf blockade, the secret military plan against the Baltic Fleet. Furthermore, Yartsev suggested that the Finns fortify the Suursaari island, but that the Soviets would take care of its defence. During the negotiations, Rudolf Holsti resigned as foreign minister, although not for reasons associated with the negotiations, and his place was taken by Eljas Erkko. Holsti was rather anti-German, so the resignation set off rumours, quickly quelled by the Finnish government, that he had been forced to resign by a Finnish government sympathetic to the Germans. The Finns attempted to appear even-handed, and the interior ministry issued an order banning the extreme-right IKL. The ban was reversed by the Finnish courts as being unconstitutional. Many years later, the minister in charge at that time, Urho Kekkonen, admitted that this was a simple gesture, to suggest to Moscow that Finland did not harbour a German fifth column.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the brigade}} arrived, {{many of the}} Germans around the drop zone withdrew or offered no further resistance. The first unit on the ground, 10 Para, {{attacked}} and destroyed the Dutch SS Wachbattalion while Brigadier Hackett personally captured ten Germans shortly after landing. When Hackett arrived at brigade headquarters, he was informed by Lieutenant Colonel Mckenzie of the division's staff about the change in plans, explaining that 11 Para was to be detached from his brigade to support the push into Arnhem. At {{the same time the}} KOSB, until then responsible for defending the northern side of the landing grounds, were attached to 4th Parachute Brigade to replace 11 Para. Meanwhile, the KOSB still had to defend landing-zone 'L', to protect gliders arriving on day three. While Hackett formulated a new plan, Mckenzie returned to divisional headquarters, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> on his arrival that 60 German tanks were approaching Arnhem from the north. Transport aircraft passing over occupied channel ports had confirmed German suspicions of a second lift such {{that they were able to}} give their troops at Arnhem forty-five minutes advance notice of the allies' arrival. Prepared in advance for such an eventuality, a Waffen SS mobile unit had been dispatched towards the likely landing grounds.|$|E
