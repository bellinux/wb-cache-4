5|$|Barkas and Ayrton {{went out}} onto the beach dunes <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> think. Barkas {{recalled}} the sacked Jasper Maskelyne, a stage magician who had briefly worked for him, saying he needed his vanishing tricks now. Ayrton agreed, suggesting they use Sunshields to make the tanks seem to be trucks, and vice versa. By {{the end of that}} afternoon they had typed up a plan and presented it to de Guingand and Richardson. They proposed to create two dummy armoured brigades to deploy in the south. They would give the appearance of not being ready by making it seem the tanks had not moved from their forming-up areas (Murrayfield and Melting Pot). Dummy tanks would replace them there; while they would mimic trucks when they arrived in the forward Martello area.|$|E
5|$|Other {{additions}} {{include the}} Rig and the Anti-Tank; the Rig is {{a modified version}} of an APC from the previous titles modified to be able to build temporary buildings, while the Anti-Tank is both a direct and long-range weapon specifically designed to do damage to tanks. Two modifications include the Battleship, which can now move and attack in one round, and the Aircraft Carrier, which can produce low-fuel aircraft called Seaplanes. Another new unit is the Gunship, which can attack and carry units as well. In discussing the online play of the game, the developers felt that it was necessary to limit online battles to only two people per battle, explaining that they felt it would be too boring for a player to have <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> stare at a screen while three other people made their moves.|$|E
25|$|Hup This is the {{traditional}} command <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> stay. When hupped the dog can be given direction called to the handler. The ability to hup a dog actively working a running bird allow the handler and any gunners to keep up without having to run.|$|E

25|$|This {{exercise}} is {{a modified version}} of the Stand for Exam. It is generally used in novice level classes and requires the handler to order the dog <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> then to move away from the dog the length of the leash. The judge will then approach the dog and pet the dog's head.|$|E
25|$|Also in mid-2006 a major {{renovation}} of C-Block and the science laboratories {{on its first}} floor was completed. The new building work included two observation classrooms (one a laboratory {{and the other a}} normal classroom), with one way mirrors allowing people in a small room in between the two observation classrooms <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> observe lessons without being seen.|$|E

He returned, therefore, to the kitchen, told the cook of the order he had received <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up <b>and</b> take Master Harry's coffee {{to him when he}} should ring, and made arrangements with Robin <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up <b>and</b> help him to enliven his vigil with a game of draughts.|$|R

25|$|Rear-hinged doors make {{entering}} and exiting {{a vehicle}} easier, allowing a passenger to enter by turning <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> exit by stepping forward and out. In combination with traditional front doors, they allow chauffeurs {{easier access to}} the rear door. In Austin FX4 taxis, drivers were able to reach the rear door handle through the driver's window without {{getting out of the}} vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Bathypelagic {{fish have}} special adaptations {{to cope with}} these {{conditions}} – they have slow metabolisms and unspecialized diets, being willing to eat anything that comes along. They prefer <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> wait for food rather than waste energy searching for it. The behaviour of bathypelagic fish can be contrasted with the behaviour of mesopelagic fish. Mesopelagic are often highly mobile, whereas bathypelagic fish are almost all lie-in-wait predators, normally expending little energy in movement.|$|E
25|$|Peerages {{were largely}} {{hereditary}} until the regular creation of life peers {{began in the}} second half of the 20th century. The last creation of a non-royal hereditary peer occurred in 1984; even then it was considered unusual. Life peers and 92 hereditary peers still retain the right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> vote in the House of Lords, though their power is restricted and further reform of the House of Lords is under consideration.|$|E

25|$|The {{swimming}} pool in this resort {{can be accessed}} through the sixth floor. The area overlooks the Strip {{with a view of}} the north and south. It features two pools and two hot spa one of each in both the South and North Strip. The one in the North Strip section features VIP cabanas for renting. In between is a bar/grill/snack-bar with a patch of grass lined with pool chairs for guests <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> eat.|$|E
25|$|During the 1930s the Adelaide (2 wards: 'P1' & 'P2') and Ellis (4 wards: 'S1'−'S4') {{groups were}} built. In the {{photograph}} above, the {{top left corner}} may show foundations for the Ellis ward group. It is believed that these wards also found work caring for the shell shock victims of World War II. The wards each featured a large covered patio area facing south and looking onto lawns and shrubbery beds allowing patients <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> relax whatever the weather, sun or rain.|$|E
25|$|In {{front of}} the church complex is the Plaza Allende, popularly known as Jardin Principal or Main Garden, but most often {{referred}} to simply as el jardin. It was designed in French style, with wrought iron benches and filled with laurel trees. It is a popular place <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> relax and bands often play in the kiosk on weekends. In addition to the parish, other important structures, such as the Ignacio Allende House, the Canal House and the municipal palace overlook the garden.|$|E

25|$|My dear Miss Hamilton, What can I have to say? Not much indeed! But to {{wish you}} a good morning, in the pretty blue and white room where I had the {{pleasure}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> read with you The Hermit, a poem which is such a favourite with me that I have read it twice this summer. Oh! What a blessing to keep good company! Very likely I {{should not have been}} acquainted with either poet or poem was it not for you.|$|E
25|$|In ancient Athens, {{often cited}} as the birthplace of democracy, only adult, male {{citizens}} who owned land were permitted to vote. Through subsequent centuries, Europe was generally ruled by monarchs, though various forms of parliament arose at different times. The high rank ascribed to abbesses within the Catholic Church permitted some women the right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> vote at national assemblies – as with various high-ranking abbesses in Medieval Germany, who were ranked among the independent princes of the empire. Their Protestant successors enjoyed the same privilege almost into modern times.|$|E
25|$|In January 2006, {{the man in}} the photographs, Malcolm McCauley, told Adelaide Now that he {{had visited}} Corby in Bali twice in 2005 – but only as a tourist {{offering}} support during her drugs trial. McCauley said he first met Corby at her court hearing in May 2005. He said Corby's mother invited him to visit Corby at Kerobokan Prison the following day. Despite claims that the photos had been taken prior to Corby's arrest, McCauley said the photos were taken at an empty fish pond at the prison where the two were permitted by prison guards <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> talk.|$|E

25|$|On March 11, 2006, the City of Cerritos {{dedicated}} a new {{sculpture garden}} featuring {{a memorial to}} the victims of the accident. The sculpture, designed by Kathleen Caricof, consists of three pieces. One piece, which resembles a wing, commemorates all the victims who perished aboard the Aeroméxico jet and the Piper. A similar, but smaller and darker wing, commemorates all the victims who perished on the ground. Each wing rests on a pedestal that lists the respective victims in alphabetical order. In front of the memorial lies a bench, which commemorates all victims and allows visitors <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> reflect on the disaster.|$|E
25|$|Olmsted also {{designed}} the Summer House, the open-air brick building that sits {{just north of}} the Capitol. Three arches open into the hexagonal structure, which encloses a fountain and twenty-two brick chairs. A fourth wall holds a small window that looks onto an artificial grotto. Built between 1879 and 1881, the Summer House was intended to answer complaints that visitors to the Capitol had no place <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> no place to obtain water for their horses and themselves. Modern drinking fountains have since replaced Olmsted's fountain for the latter purpose. Olmsted intended to build a second, matching Summer House on the southern side of the Capitol, but congressional objections led to the project's cancellation.|$|E
25|$|Population of {{the country}} {{did not have a}} bed or chair <b>to</b> <b>sit,</b> <b>and</b> to eat they do not use a spoon or chopsticks. Men and women enjoy chewing betel nut mixed with, betel leaves, and white chalk made from ground mussels shells. They eat rice for meal, first they took a scoop of water and soak betel in their mouth, then wash their hands and sit down to make a circle; getting a plate of rice soaked in butter (probably coconut milk) and gravy, and eat using hands to lift the rice and put it in their mouth. When {{receiving}} guests, they will offer the guests, not the tea, but with betel nut.|$|E
