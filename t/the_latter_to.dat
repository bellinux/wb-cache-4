5|$|Some {{paintings}} also {{depict the}} sacrifice of Aravan.

5|$|After finalizing their lineup, Something Corporate began {{performing}} at local venues, eventually gaining support slots for {{groups such as}} Better Than Ezra and Sugar Ray. Shortly afterwards, the band signed to independent label Drive-Thru Records.

5|$|Alley's {{retirement}} {{was marked}} {{by a series of}} discharges from the military, trials, and prison sentences. At one trial, Zinsou's conduct sparked another coup led by Kouandété. On October 26, 1972, Mathieu Kérékou seized power in a coup. He ended Alley's military career, {{as well as that of}} every other senior officer, and named Alley commissioner of the National Oil Wells (SNADAH), a role with very little responsibility. Kérékou accused Alley of plotting against him on February 28, 1973, and sentenced <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>to</b> 20 years in prison. He died on March 28, 1987.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all modern}} paleontologists agreed with Riggs {{that the two}} dinosaurs should be {{classified}} together in a single genus. According {{to the rules of}} the ICZN (which governs the scientific names of animals), the name Apatosaurus, having been published first, has priority as the official name; Brontosaurus was considered a junior synonym and was therefore long discarded from formal use. Despite this, at least one paleontologistRobert T. Bakkerargued in the 1990s that A.ajax and A.excelsus were in fact sufficiently distinct for <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>to</b> merit a separate genus.|$|E

5|$|Another species {{complex in}} Attalea {{includes}} A.speciosa and related species. Henderson (1995) recognised A.speciosa and A.spectabilis, considering <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>to</b> either be an acaulescent form of A.speciosa or a hybrid {{between it and}} A.microcarpa. Govaerts and Dransfield accepted A.spectabilis, but Glassman considered it a dubious taxon. Attalea vitrivir was recognised as a distinct species by Michael Balick and coauthors; Glassman and Govaerts and Dransfield concurred, but Henderson considered it part of A.speciosa. Glassman also described a fourth member of this group, A.brejinhoensis, and it is accepted by Govaerts and Dransfield.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1960s, the power stations' {{operating}} hours were decreased due {{to the opening of}} the much larger Blyth power station in Northumberland. This meant that less ash was produced by the Stella and Dunston stations; so {{by the end of the}} 1960s, the CEGB sold Hexhamshire Lass and Bobby Shaftoe. The former went to a firm in Fareham, Hampshire, where it worked as a sand dredger until scrapped in 1993; <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>to</b> a French dredging company.|$|E
5|$|At Issus in 333BC, {{his first}} {{confrontation}} with Darius, {{he used the}} same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through. Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army. At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels {{to break up the}} phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>to</b> flee once again.|$|E

During his tenure with the Development Program, he made the choice to play NCAA hockey, opting against the major junior Ontario Hockey League (OHL) in order to attend college. The decision was encouraged by his father, who valued Booth's education. Enrolled at Michigan State University while playing for the school's hockey team, he studied dentistry before switching to general management.|$|E
5|$|Grosser Kurfürst {{was lost}} in 1878 during {{maneuvers}} shortly after her commissioning, when a pair of small sailing boats crossed the bows of Grosser Kurfürst and , which caused both ships to undertake emergency maneuvers. In the confusion, König Wilhelm collided with Grosser Kurfürst, causing <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>to</b> sink. Both Preussen and Friedrich der Grosse served in the fleet until the 1890s, when they were relegated to secondary duties, including serving as harbor ships, and later as coal hulks. The ships were eventually scrapped {{following the end of}} World War I, in 1919 and 1920, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In {{neighboring}} {{areas of}} Russia {{there are significant}} numbers of Norway spruce, but they only exist sporadically within Øvre Pasvik, {{with no more than}} 40 trees in one place. The lack of spruce is caused by a combination of frost occurring as late as June, and wildfire. There is also a limited amount of birch, specifically dwarf birch and silver birch. Aspen is uncommon largely because its bark and roots are popular food for animals. Along some creeks there are bird cherry and grey alder. The area is too dry to allow <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>to</b> grow away from creeks and lake sides. There are eight to ten species of willow within the national park.|$|E

5|$|Looking at {{symbolism}} in religion, Stace {{states that}} {{there are two types of}} predicates applied to God: first, the ethically-neutral sort, such as God being mind, power or personhood. Secondly, the ethical kind, where he is love, mercy, or righteousness. He explains that the former qualities are justified by an appeal to a hierarchy of being, and <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>to</b> a hierarchy of value. In both cases the more adequate symbol are those that are higher in each hierarchy. In rooting symbolism in hierarchies, Stace explicitly states he is in opposition to Otto who thought religious symbolism was based on analogy between the numen and qualities found in the natural world.|$|E
5|$|McGivney {{traveled}} to Boston {{to examine the}} Massachusetts Catholic Order of Foresters and to Brooklyn, New York {{to learn about the}} recently established Catholic Benevolent League, both of which offered insurance benefits.

He explored establishing a New Haven Court of the Foresters, but the group's charter in Massachusetts limited them to operating within the Commonwealth.
