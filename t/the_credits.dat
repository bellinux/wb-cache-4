50|$|Subsequent years saw {{consistent}} {{growth from}} <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> union. <b>The</b> <b>credit</b> union passed $100 {{million in assets}} in 1984 and achieved the $500 million milestone in 1997. In August 2001, <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> union passed $1 billion in assets. In 2004, <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> union decided to expand beyond Northwest Airlines and open its doors to anyone employed in the air transportation industry in the United States. To reflect a changing membership, the name of <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> union was changed to Wings Financial Federal Credit Union.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>credit</b> {{union was}} founded in June, 1957 as Big Bear Employees Credit Union {{by a group of}} {{employees}} that worked for the former Big Bear Stores Company. <b>The</b> <b>credit</b> union's office was located within the headquarters of the Big Bear Stores Company, located at 770 W. Goodale Blvd. in Columbus, Ohio. In 1983, <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> union moved its office to a Big Bear Stores satellite office, located at 1184 Dublin Road in Columbus. The new location allowed <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> union to double its space, and provided enough room for six employees. In 1990, <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> union moved into its first office with its own public entrance, located in converted warehouse space at 851 W. 3rd Avenue in Columbus. In March 2003, noting that only fifteen percent of <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> union's members were employed by Big Bear Stores Company, <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> union's membership voted to change the name of <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> union to Members First <b>Credit</b> Union, providing <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> union with a brand new identity. By the end of 2003, Big Bear Stores announced that their company would cease operations by the beginning of 2004. In March 2004, <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> union moved into a newly built facility, located at 1445 W. Goodale Blvd. {{in the heart of the}} Grandview / Marble Cliff area.|$|R
30|$|Since 1990 s {{some major}} banks {{acknowledged}} {{the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> risk was still the key factor in financial risks {{and they began to}} concern about the problems of <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> risk measurement, trying to establish the internal method and model for measuring <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> risk. Among those models, <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> risk management system “Credit Metrics” by J.P. Morgan obtained the widest attention.|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>credit</b> {{derivative}} contract {{is a new}} type of contract in the Financial Law and Banking Law that emerged in the early 1990 ’s and now applies all over the world. The purpose of <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> {{derivative contract}} is to transfer credit risk associated with underlying instruments to the counterpart, without delivering or transferring any of the underlying instrument itself. The part that takes over <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> risk receives payment for taking over <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> risk from <b>the</b> other part. The thesis analyses <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> derivative contract in relation to the existing legislation, the legal nature of this type of contract and compares it to similar types of contracts in Swedish Law and English Law. The thesis analyses also the two main types of <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> derivative contracts and 2003 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions and 2002 ISDA Master Agreement. These documents constitute the partly standardised documentation that is used to document <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> derivative contract. Based on the analysis described above, the thesis presents conclusions regarding development of <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> derivative contract. Some of important conclusions are that <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> derivative contract is a different type of contract from <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> insurance contract and some other types of contract, that <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> derivative contract is dependent on its comprehensive documentation and that it is {{a new type of}} contract because it combines the existing legal terms and elements in a new way...|$|R

50|$|The renewal {{community}} employment credit provides {{businesses with}} {{an incentive to}} hire individuals who both {{live and work in}} a renewal community. Employers can claim <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> if they pay or incur “qualified zone wages” to a “qualified zone employee”. <b>The</b> <b>credit</b> is for wages paid or incurred after 2001. <b>The</b> <b>credit</b> is 15% of the qualified wages paid or incurred during a calendar year. The amount of qualified wages you can use to figure <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> cannot be more than $10,000 for each employee for each calendar year.
