40|$|Tillering is a core {{constituent}} {{of plant}} architecture, and influences light interception to affect plant and crop performance. Near-isogenic lines (NILs) varying for a tiller inhibition (tin) gene and representing two genetic backgrounds were investigated for tillering dynamics, organ size distribution, leaf area, light interception, red: far-red ratio, and chlorophyll content. Tillering ceased {{earlier in the}} <b>tin</b> <b>lines</b> to reduce the frequencies of later primary and secondary tillers compared to the free-tillering NILs, and demonstrated the genetically lower tillering plasticity of tin-containing lines. The distribution of organ sizes along shoots varied between NILs contrasting for tin. Internode elongation commenced at a lower phytomer, and the peduncle was shorter in the <b>tin</b> <b>lines.</b> The flag leaves of <b>tin</b> <b>lines</b> were larger, and the longest leaf blades were observed at higher phytomers in the tin than in free-tillering lines. Total leaf area was reduced in <b>tin</b> <b>lines,</b> and non-tin lines invested more leaf area at mid-canopy height. The tiller economy (ratio of seed-bearing shoots to numbers of shoots produced) was 10 % greater in the <b>tin</b> <b>lines</b> (0. 73 – 0. 76) compared to the free-tillering sisters (0. 62 – 0. 63). At maximum tiller number, the red: far-red ratio (light quality stimulus that is thought to induce the cessation of tillering) at the plant-base was 0. 18 – 0. 22 in <b>tin</b> <b>lines</b> and 0. 09 – 0. 11 in free-tillering lines at levels of photosynthetic active radiation of 49 – 53 % and 30 – 33 %, respectively. The <b>tin</b> <b>lines</b> intercepted less radiation compared to their free-tillering sisters once genotypic differences in tiller numbers had established, and maintained green leaf area in the lower canopy later into the season. Greater light extinction coefficients (k) in <b>tin</b> <b>lines</b> prior to, but reduced k after, spike emergence indicated that differences in light interception between NILs contrasting in tin cannot be explained by leaf area alone but that geometric and optical canopy properties contributed. The careful characterization of specifically-developed NILs is refining {{the development of a}} physiology-based model for tillering to improve understanding of the value of architectural traits for use in cereal improvement...|$|R

40|$|The Australian wheat {{production}} environments {{are typically}} water-limited, and both temperature and vapour pressure deficit increase {{as the season}} progresses. As a result, high incidences of small or shriveled wheat kernels (screenings) are commonly generated and can substantially reduce grain value. Previous studies suggest the incorporation of the tiller inhibition (tin) gene can reduce the production of infertile tillers and increase kernel weight (KW). It was hypothesised that the incorporation of the tin gene into wheat germplasm may a) contribute {{to the maintenance of}} large KW and reduction in screenings (SCR) in terminal water deficit environments; and b) not be associated with a grain yield (GY) penalty in terminal water deficit environments. Thus, the major objective of this thesis was to evaluate the expression and performance of tin gene in terms of GY and SCR: 1) in different genetic backgrounds and across Australian production environments; 2) in various northern production environments which are particularly prone to terminal water deficit conditions; and 3) to determine the mechanisms that contribute to the maintenance of large KW of <b>tin</b> <b>lines</b> in terminal stress conditions. To address the overall objective, populations of lines were genotyped for the presence/absence of the tin gene and were field tested. Line differences in GY, yield components, SCR and general growth and development attributes were determined in 22 field experiments conducted between 2005 - 2007. The experiments were grouped into those that evaluated: a large number of sister lines from four genetic backgrounds in multi-location experiments; selected lines from Silverstar population in multi-location experiments; and selected sister lines in detailed agronomic experiments examining the effect of plant density and controlled levels of water supply {{through the use of a}} rainout shelter facility. The effect of tin on GY and SCR varied with environment and genetic background. In the Brookton, Wyalkatchem and Chara background, there was no reduction in GY associated with tin in southern production environments. However, a 31 % and 10 %, advantage of free-tillering over reduced tillering Silverstar lines existed in the 2005 western and 2006 northern experiments respectively, and led to an average 12 % reduction in GY of Silverstar <b>tin</b> <b>lines.</b> In northern experiments, <b>tin</b> <b>lines</b> in a Silverstar background produced up to 50 % fewer SCR than Silverstar free-tillering lines. Averaged across experiments, KW of Silverstar <b>tin</b> <b>lines</b> was 10 % greater than free-tillering lines. Based on stem number per plant, Silverstar lines were classified into three groups; the restricted (R) and semi-restricted (SR) <b>tin</b> and free-tillering <b>lines</b> attained 2. 9, 3. 4 and 4. 8 stems per plant respectively. Expression of tin in terms of maximum stem number production was genetic background and genotype dependent, and unlike free-tillering <b>lines,</b> R <b>tin</b> <b>lines</b> in particular, were not as responsive to plant density. Head number per unit area rather than kernel number per head was strongly associated with KW determination. Therefore, to maximize KW under water limiting conditions it is more beneficial if high kernel number can be achieved via the production of low head number with more kernels per head, as can be achieved with the use of <b>tin</b> <b>lines.</b> The KW advantage of Silverstar R tin was associated with greater anthesis total dry matter, stem water soluble carbohydrate and nitrogen available per head relative to free-tillering lines, and thus R <b>tin</b> <b>lines</b> had more assimilate for translocation during the grain filling period. In a terminal water deficit experiment, individual KW data collected for Silverstar <b>tin</b> and free-tillering <b>lines</b> revealed that KW of <b>tin</b> <b>lines</b> (≈ 25 mg per kernel) was maintained for main stem to fourth tiller heads and across floret positions 1 - 4 within spikelets. In contrast, free-tillering lines (≈ 18 mg per kernel) generated small kernels across the entire plant, with the largest proportion originating from floret positions 3 and 4. <b>Lines</b> containing the <b>tin</b> gene had a greater mean KW and kernel width, and a higher frequency of wider kernels than free-tillering lines. The high frequency of large kernel widths was associated with significantly less SCR in <b>tin</b> <b>lines.</b> A strong positive association between maturity head number per plant and SCR indicated, for every fertile head produced, SCR increased by 11 % in the terminal water deficit experiment. Reduction in SCR in the Silverstar tin material in the north, was associated with high KW and a tendency for lower GY, although <b>tin</b> <b>lines</b> with equivalent GY to Silverstar could be identified in each environment. The incorporation of the tin gene has the potential to significantly reduce the incidence of SCR in commercial wheat crops. The reduction in GY associated with the tin gene was dependent on genetic background, suggesting the potential for selection of higher-yielding tin progeny in commercial line development. However, a tailored agronomic package to optimize yield potential of <b>tin</b> <b>lines</b> needs to be developed for different target environments. With the incorporation of the tin gene into genetic material adapted to the northern wheat belt and optimisation of head density, there exists scope for simultaneous improvements in GY and KW and subsequent reduction in SCR for terminal water deficit environments...|$|R

40|$|Post-anthesis {{water deficit}} and {{increasing}} vapour pressure deficit are common and {{can result in}} reduced grain yield {{and the development of}} small or shrivelled wheat kernels (screenings) that reduce grain value. Previous studies suggest incorporation of a tiller inhibition (tin) gene to restrict tiller number and thereby slow water use and promote the development of larger, fertile spikes to increase kernel weight. This paper reports on the influence of the tin gene on grain yield and screenings in multiple wheat genetic backgrounds assessed in field experiments in 2005 and 2006. Across environments, grain yield ranged from 0. 90 to 5. 50 t/ha and screenings from 4 to 20 %. The effect of tin on grain yield and screenings varied with environment and genetic background. Grain yield was unchanged in <b>tin</b> <b>lines</b> derived from varieties Brookton, Chara, and Wyalkatchem assessed in southern Australian environments. However, there was a 31 and 10 % advantage of free-tillering over tin-containing Silverstar lines for the 2005 western and 2006 northern experiments, respectively, resulting in an average 12 % reduction in grain yield of Silverstar <b>tin</b> <b>lines.</b> In northern experiments, where screenings ranged from 4 to 12 %, Silverstar-based <b>tin</b> <b>lines</b> produced significantly fewer screenings than free-tillering sister lines. Reduction in screenings was associated with a higher kernel weight (+ 10 %) and a tendency for lower grain yield, although individual Silverstar tin progeny with grain yield equivalent to the parent were readily identified. The incorporation of the tin gene has considerable potential to reduce the incidence of screenings in commercial wheat crops. Variation in grain yield associated with the tin gene was dependent on genetic background, with potential for selection of higher yielding tin progeny for commercial line development...|$|R

40|$|Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{with the}} ‘Gigas’ or ‘Big Ear’ {{characteristics}} {{is easy to}} distinguish from other commercial wheat. The main distinguishing characteristics for ‘Gigas’ wheat include: uniculm plants, large number of spikelets per spike and a thick stem. The reduction in tillering {{is due to a}} single recessive gene, designated tin, for tiller inhibition. The tin gene is located on wheat chromosome 1 AS. It has been reported that spring wheat <b>lines</b> containing the <b>tin</b> gene had a 90 % reduction in tillering when planted during the spring and summer, but if planted during late fall/winter the effect was only 30 - 50 % reduction in tillering. One of the objectives {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of the tin gene in a winter wheat background on agronomic performance. A second objective of this study was to identify QTL for traits that are associated with the tin gene, which include spike length, number of spikelets per spike, seeds per spikelet, grams of seed per spike, plant height, and stem diameter. ^ In the first experiment to investigate the effect of the tin gene on the agronomic performance of winter wheat, two doubled haploid (DH) populations were produced. The DH lines were selected for being either free tillering or tin. The first experiment evaluated the agronomic performance at two locations during the 2013 / 2014 season. The <b>tin</b> <b>lines</b> produced significantly fewer spikes per m 2 but significantly more spikelets per spike, seeds per spikelet, grams of seed per spikelet, and had wider stems.

QTL were identified for the number of spikes per plant on 1 A, number of seeds per spikelet also on 1 A, and grams of seed per spike on 6 B. ^ The results of these studies provide potential genetic sources which could be utilized by breeders.
