5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{escalating}} violence the government was forced to appeal for international peacekeepers on 25 May. Peacekeepers began to arrive in Dili the next day and eventually restored order. A total of 37 people were killed in the fighting in April and May and 155,000 fled their homes. A United Nations inquiry found that the interior and defence ministers and the commander of the F-FDTL had illegally transferred weapons to civilians during the crisis and recommended <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> prosecuted.|$|E
5|$|As of December 2007, the TTB lists both Zinfandel and Primitivo as {{approved}} grape varieties for American wines, {{but they are}} not listed as synonyms. U.S. producers, therefore, must label a wine according to whether it is Zinfandel or Primitivo. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) proposed in 2002 <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> recognised as synonyms, but no decision on this proposal (RIN 1513–AA32, formerly RIN 1512-AC65) has been made.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the maximum}} calibre of naval gun allowed under the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was 40.6cm (16inch), Hitler soon had second {{thoughts}} about the guns {{to be used for}} the new ships and ordered <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> armed with 38cm (15inch) weapons. However, the 28.3cm turrets were readily available; 38cm turrets would take years to develop, and Hitler wanted capital ships as soon as possible to fulfill his political ideals. He was also reminded that, despite the allowances of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the British had historically been sensitive about increases in main gun calibers aboard German capital ships. He therefore acquiesced to the ships' being armed with 28.3cm guns, with the provision <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> upgunned to 38cm at the earliest opportunity.

5|$|After the Fall of France, some French {{scientists}} {{escaped to}} Britain with their stock of heavy water.

It therefore recommended <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> relocated to the United States, and co-located with the Manhattan Project's reactor effort.
