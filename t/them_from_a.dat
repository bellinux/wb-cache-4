5|$|As King William {{intensely}} {{disliked the}} Duchess and Conroy, {{he vowed to}} wait until Victoria came of age to die simply to keep <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> regency. In 1831, the year of William's coronation, Conroy and the Duchess embarked {{on a series of}} royal tours with Victoria to expose her to the people and solidify their status as potential regents. On one trip Conroy was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Oxford. Their efforts were ultimately successful and, in November 1831, it was declared that the Duchess would be sole regent in the event of Victoria's young queenship, while Conroy could claim to be the closest adviser to the Duchess and her daughter.|$|E

During this time, he served in China delivering much-needed supplies to a country devastated by the long Second Sino-Japanese War and once even saved the lives of 90students by sheltering <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Kuomintang officer. By donning an American army officer's uniform, Harrison was able to convince the Kuomintang officer to not check a barge which held the students hidden inside.|$|E
5|$|Reach {{features}} updated {{versions of}} old weapons, plus new weapons fulfilling various combat roles. In Halo 3, players can carry single-use equipment power-ups that offer temporary offensive or defensive advantages. This system of single-use equipment is replaced in Reach by reusable and persistent armor abilities that remain with a character {{until they are}} replaced. The abilities are a jetpack; active camouflage; sprint; hologram, which creates a facsimile of the player running towards a target point; drop shield, which creates a bubble that heals those inside and protects <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> limited amount of damage; and armor lock, which immobilizes the player but grants invincibility {{for a brief period}} of time. When playing as Covenant Elites, players also have access to an evade armor ability.|$|E

Pitt was badly {{in debt and}} King George III {{believed}} that the post, which came with a salary of £3,000 a year, would usefully supplement Pitt's income. Pitt made extensive use of the castle and by 1803 he used it as his main residence {{in an effort to}} reduce his living costs. Pitt's niece, Lady Hester Stanhope, joined him at Walmer between 1803 and 1806; together with Pitt, she carried out extensive work on the castle gardens, transforming <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> simple kitchen garden into a set of landscaped ornamental enclosures; Stanhope enlisted the Dover militia to help with the landscaping and planting.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the episode, flashbacks {{depict a}} young Sam (Ford) and Dean (Canipe) on Christmas Eve of 1991; {{with their father}} out on a hunt, the {{brothers}} are staying alone in a motel room until he returns. As Sam wraps an object he obtained from Bobby Singer as a present for his father, he begins to question Dean about what their father is doing. Although Dean brushes him off, Sam reveals that he has read their father's hunting journal. Dean acquiesces, and confirms that their father hunts monsters. This revelation terrifies Sam, who is afraid that the monsters will come after them. Later that night, Dean wakes Sam up and claims that their father briefly returned and left presents. When Sam's gifts {{end up being a}} Barbie doll and a sparkly baton, Dean admits that he stole <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> nearby house.

Duncan enters the room and they discover several videotapes which show Lilly {{having an affair with}} Logan's father, Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin). Veronica believes that Lilly found the tapes and refused to return them, which angered Aaron and he killed her; Duncan arrived home to find Lilly dead and had an epileptic fit, at which time Jake and Celeste returned home. While an unseen person watches <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> closet, Veronica calls Keith and tells him that she will bring home the tapes, noting that Aaron is at the party.

5|$|A 2–1 away defeat to Barrow saw {{the team}} {{knocked out of}} the FA Trophy in the quarter-final, Pacquette scoring for York. York {{suffered}} a second straight league defeat after being beaten 2–1 away by Forest Green Rovers, in which Mackin scored after his shot hit {{the back of an}} opposition player. Chester's expulsion from the Football Conference resulted in York having the three points gained against <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 3–2 victory expunged, meaning the team moved down to sixth in the table. York were defeated 2–1 at home by Salisbury, after Sangaré had put the team in the lead. Chesterfield midfielder Paul Harsley joined on loan {{until the end of the}} season, and made his debut in a 0–0 draw away to Altrincham, a result that ended a run of three consecutive defeats. York's first victory in six league matches was a 1–0 away win over Mansfield, Pitt scoring his first goal for the club. McWilliams was loaned out to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Whitby Town for one month. A second successive victory came after Barrett scored the only goal in a 1–0 away victory over Kidderminster. Graham opened the scoring in a 1–1 home draw with Tamworth, who equalised through former York player Chris Smith. A 4–0 victory away to Grays saw Brodie score for the first time since January 2010 with two goals; Harsley and Barrett also scored.|$|E

5|$|Frogs {{can hear}} {{both in the}} air and below water. They do not have {{external}} ears; the eardrums (tympanic membranes) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind the eye. The size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls. In some species such as the bullfrog, the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females, the eyes and tympani are much the same size. A noise causes the tympanum to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear. The middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation. In the inner ear, the auditory hair cells are arranged in two areas of the cochlea, the basilar papilla and the amphibian papilla. The former detects high frequencies and the latter low frequencies. Because the cochlea is short, frogs use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds. This arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their conspecifics. In some species that inhabit arid regions, the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> dormant state. A frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not usually take any action until it has located the source of the sound by sight.|$|E
5|$|In Challenge mode, {{the player}} must sneak around and deliver food to hungry NPCs. Hunger is {{indicated}} above thought bubbles which float above {{the heads of}} the NPCs. An NPC with a burger icon over their head is able to be given food, but they will lose their appetite if they spot the player. NPCs move around the map in a set pattern and have a narrow cone of vision to detect player. Erik Brudvig of IGN described this narrow cone of vision as being similar to those of Metal Gear Solid. NPCs can also detect the player by excessive noise, the amount of sound a player is making is indicated by a noise meter. Challenges can be failed if a player alerts NPCs to their presence. Successful delivery of an item requires sneaking up behind an NPC or surprising <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> hiding place. Points are awarded based on how hungry a character is, the player's stealth and proximity to the NPC and style points on delivery. When presenting food, a Flourish meter appears which quickly fills and empties, requiring a timed button press. The higher the flourish meter, the more style points. Each level has 20 associated challenges and fulfilling half the challenges on a level opens the way to the next level. Once all 80 challenges are completed, an alternative costume is unlocked. Gamerscore is rewarded for achieving certain goals or style on the Xbox 360 version.|$|E
5|$|Million Dollar Challenge is a {{poker game}} show where amateur poker players attempt to defeat celebrities, {{professional}} poker players and, eventually, Daniel Negreanu {{in order to}} win the show's grand prize, $1 million. In the first round, the amateur (with Negreanu at their side, acting as their coach and lending advice) must defeat a celebrity such as Jayde Nicole, Jerome Bettis, Joanna Krupa, John Salley or Tito Ortiz. If the contestant is able to defeat the celebrity the contestant wins a trip to the Bahamas and advances to the second round. In the second round, the amateur (with Negreanu now helping <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> sound proof booth, giving them advice through a listening device in the amateur's ear) must defeat a professional poker player such as Vanessa Rousso, Barry Greenstein, Joe Cada or Chris Moneymaker. If the contestant is able to defeat the professional the contestant wins $25,000 in addition to the trip to the Bahamas. At this point, the amateur has a decision to make. Keep the money and walk away $25,000 richer, or risk the money (the trip is still theirs to keep) and play Daniel Negreanu heads-up for $100,000, knowing that if they lose they walk away with nothing but the trip to the Bahamas. In the season finale, the champions from each episode compete against each other in a sit-n-go tournament, the winner of which plays Negreanu for $1 million.|$|E
