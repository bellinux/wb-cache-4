5|$|Denholm Elliott as Dr. Marcus Brody: Indiana's bumbling English colleague. Elliott {{returned}} after Spielberg sought <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> <b>the</b> tone of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), following the actor's absence in the darker Temple of Doom (1984).|$|E
5|$|John Rhys-Davies as Sallah: A {{friend of}} Indiana and a {{professional}} excavator living in Cairo. Like Elliott's, Rhys-Davies' return was an attempt <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> <b>the</b> spirit of Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} on 9 June, a Royalist force led by Sir Michael Woodhouse attempted <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> <b>the</b> castle, now garrisoned by Parliament. The counter-attack was unsuccessful, {{ending in}} the rout of the Royalist {{forces in a}} skirmish at the nearby village of Wistanstow.|$|E

They again achieved third place in 1966, after losing to St. Louis, 1-0, in the semi-final. The Mids {{would return to the}} Tournament three more times with Glenn Warner, but would never come close <b>to</b> <b>recapturing</b> <b>the</b> title.|$|R

5|$|Benedict Arnold again led a {{fleet of}} ships at the Battle of Valcour Island, and played other key roles in thwarting Britain's attempt <b>to</b> <b>{{recapture}}</b> <b>the</b> fort in 1776. The British did recapture the fort in July 1777 during the Saratoga campaign, but had abandoned it by November after Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga.|$|E
5|$|Despite these improvements, {{a second}} {{invasion}} {{by the former}} Katangan gendarmerie, known as Shaba II in May–June 1978, was only dispersed with the despatch of the French 2e régiment étranger de parachutistes and a battalion of the Belgian Paracommando Regiment. Kamanyola Division units collapsed almost immediately. French units fought the Battle of Kolwezi <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> <b>the</b> town from the FLNC. The U.S. provided logistical assistance.|$|E
5|$|On 23 May 1948, the Indian Army {{captured}} Tithwal from Pakistani troops, but the Pakistanis quickly {{launched a}} counter-attack <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> <b>the</b> area. The Indian troops, unable {{to withstand the}} attack, withdrew from their positions to the Tithwal ridge, preparing to regain their positions at the right moment.|$|E
50|$|Massacre Bay {{was among}} the landing sites of United States Army troops in the Battle of Attu in May 1943, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>recapture</b> of <b>the</b> island from the Japanese during World War II.|$|R

5|$|The Germans {{refrained from}} {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> <b>the</b> lost ground at Lens, {{due to the}} demands of defensive operations of the Third Battle of Ypres and the need to avoid the diversion of forces from the main effort. The Canadian attack prevented the Germans from transferring five divisions in the Lens area to Flanders.|$|E
5|$|The {{transformation}} of age-old customs, commerce and administration to the Swedish model {{could not be}} effected quickly or easily. In the first fifty years of the transition, {{the treatment of the}} population was quite harsh. Denmark made several attempts <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> <b>the</b> territories, the last in 1710, but ultimately conceded the territories as lost.|$|E
5|$|When the British paratroopers had withdrawn, two of {{the guns}} were put back into action by the Germans.

5|$|A {{declared}} {{purpose of}} the Treaty of the Triple Alliance was the demolition of the Humaitá fortifications and that none others of that sort should be built again. However the fortress, though not by then invulnerable to the latest armour-plated warships, was a serious obstacle to the Allies’ plans to proceed upriver to the Paraguayan capital Asunción and <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian territory of Mato Grosso: it delayed them {{for two and a}} half years. It was taken in the Siege of Humaitá (1868), then razed pursuant to the Treaty.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the team}} was {{considered}} successful, {{in spite of the}} failure <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> <b>The</b> Ashes, the problems between the players and the administrators continued. Before the team departed Australia, the players arbitrarily replaced one of the selected players without recourse to the ACC. After the final match in England, Trott and his players broke an agreement to return home in time for the 1896–97 Australian season. Instead, they organised matches in North America and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|As more {{reinforcements}} {{arrived from}} Hudong-ni on 30 November, the garrisons attempted <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> <b>the</b> East Hill. All efforts failed despite {{the destruction of}} a Chinese company. When darkness settled, the PVA 58th Division gathered its remaining 1,500 soldiers in a last-ditch attempt to capture Hagaru-ri. The reinforced defenders annihilated most of the attacking forces, with only the defences around the East Hill giving way. As the Chinese tried to advance from the East Hill, they were cut down by the 31st Tank Company.|$|E
50|$|The {{battle of}} Rio Nuevo {{was the last}} Spanish attempt <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> Jamaica. <b>The</b> island would {{eventually}} be fully ceded to England by Spain in 1670 {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Madrid.|$|R

5|$|Because of Plant's injuries, Led Zeppelin did not tour in 1976. Instead, {{the band}} {{completed}} the concert film The Song Remains the Same {{and the accompanying}} soundtrack album. The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans. The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where, unwilling to tour since 1975 because of their tax exile status, Led Zeppelin faced an uphill battle <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> <b>the</b> public's affection.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{promising}} start Reid failed <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> <b>the</b> form {{he had shown}} at Forest and {{had to wait until}} May before netting for his new club, coming against Aston Villa in a 5–1 win {{at the end of the}} season. Making only 20 starts in 26 appearances he scored just one goal for Tottenham leading him to be listed by one journalist as one of the worst signings of the January Transfer market.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the British {{captured}} the fort in the Siege of Fort Mackinac, the first {{battle of the}} conflict, because the Americans had not yet heard that war had been declared. The victorious British attempted to protect their prize by building Fort George on the high ground behind Fort Mackinac. In 1814, the Americans and British fought a second battle {{on the north side}} of the island. The American second-in-command, Major Andrew Holmes, was killed and the Americans failed <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> <b>the</b> island.|$|E

50|$|On 4 August, ISIL {{launched}} a counter-offensive, <b>recapturing</b> <b>the</b> territory {{north of the}} Ancient Quarries {{and south of the}} Jazal Mountains. However, the SAA managed to repel the ISIL assault and <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> most of <b>the</b> lost territory.|$|R

5|$|General Archibald Wavell—the {{commander-in-chief}} of the British Middle East Command—conceived Operation Brevity as a rapid blow in the Sollum area. Wavell {{intended to}} create advantageous conditions {{from which to}} launch Operation Battleaxe, the main offensive that he was planning for June. Operation Brevity's primary objectives were <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> <b>the</b> Halfaya Pass, to drive the enemy from the Sollum and Capuzzo areas, and to deplete Rommel's forces. A secondary objective was to advance toward Tobruk, although {{only as far as}} supplies would allow, and without risking the force committed to the operation.|$|E
5|$|In May 7, 2007, Melina began feuding with Playboy {{cover girl}} Candice Michelle, {{after she was}} {{defeated}} in a tag team match alongside Victoria against Candice Michelle and Mickie James.

Outraged, Phyllis' husband Bob Vance (Bobby Ray Shafer) throws {{him out of the}} reception hall. Dwight does not let him re-enter, taking satisfaction in being able to eject a real wedding crasher. Michael finds company with Uncle Al, and eventually confesses that he is sorry for his behavior and worried that it may have sullied Phyllis' day.|$|E
50|$|Within two years, Cao Cao {{was able}} <b>to</b> <b>recapture</b> all <b>the</b> cities in Yan Province and {{defeated}} Lü Bu at Juye. Lü Bu then fled eastwards to join Liu Bei, {{who had taken}} over Xu Province from Tao Qian.|$|R
50|$|In October 1993, Aliev was {{formally}} elected president {{and promised to}} bring social order to the country in addition <b>to</b> <b>recapturing</b> <b>the</b> lost regions. In October, Azerbaijan joined the CIS. The winter season was marked with similar conditions {{as in the previous}} year, both sides scavenging for wood and harvesting foodstuffs months in advance. Two subsequent UNSC resolutions on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict were passed, (874 and 884), in October and November, reemphasizing the same points as the previous two, they acknowledged Nagorno-Karabakh as a region of Azerbaijan Republic.|$|R
5000|$|Washington voters tend {{to support}} Democratic Party candidates, with the New York Times {{referring}} to the state as [...] "Democratopolis." [...] The last Republican governor in Washington was John Spellman, who held office from 1981 to 1985. Republicans came closest <b>to</b> <b>recapturing</b> <b>the</b> state's chief executive office in 2004 when Democrat Christine Gregoire secured election by just 133 votes out of 2.8 million cast. The last time Washington gave its electoral votes to a Republican candidate for U.S. president was in 1984, when {{a majority in the}} state voted for Ronald Reagan.|$|R
