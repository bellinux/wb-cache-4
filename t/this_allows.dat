5|$|Photoluminescence from SWCNT, {{as well as}} optical {{absorption}} and Raman scattering, is linearly polarized along the tube axis. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> monitoring of the SWCNTs orientation without direct microscopic observation.|$|E
5|$|Angle-resolved low-coherence {{interferometry}} (a/LCI) uses {{scattered light}} {{to measure the}} sizes of subcellular objects, including cell nuclei. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> interferometry depth measurements to be combined with density measurements. Various correlations have been found between the state of tissue health and the measurements of subcellular objects. For example, {{it has been found}} that as tissue changes from normal to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size increases.|$|E
5|$|Antibody genes also re-organize in {{a process}} called class {{switching}} that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> a single antibody {{to be used by}} different types of Fc receptors, expressed on different parts of the immune system.|$|E

5|$|Applesauce cake {{tends to}} be moist due to the liquid content present in the apple sauce. However, using a chunky-style apple sauce {{can result in a}} cake with less moisture, {{compared}} to using standard apple sauce. Letting it sit for one or two days before serving can increase its flavor, as <b>this</b> <b>allows</b> time for the ingredients to intermingle within the cake.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} pet species, {{a variety of}} colors, coat types, and other {{features}} that do {{not appear in the}} wild have either been developed, or have appeared spontaneously. Any individual rat may be defined one or more ways by its color, coat, marking, and non-standard body type. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> for very specific classifications such as a ruby-eyed cinnamon Berkshire rex Dumbo.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids are {{the right}} whales. These animals have very large heads, which can make {{up as much as}} 40% of their body mass, and much of the head is the mouth. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> them to take in large amounts of water into their mouths, letting them feed more effectively.|$|E
30|$|<b>This</b> <b>allowed</b> {{constructing}} of six distinct initial matrices {{for each}} set of answers.|$|R

5|$|Cortana on Windows {{mobile and}} Android {{is capable of}} {{capturing}} device notifications and sending them to a Windows 10 device. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> a computer user to view notifications from their phone in the Windows 10 Action Center. The feature was announced in early 2016 and released later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Criticism must {{generally}} {{be expressed in}} a temperate and dispassionate manner. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> rational debate about the issues raised, and thus may even contribute to the improvement and strengthening of the administration of justice.|$|E
5|$|Energy and {{momentum}} are conserved {{only on the}} average in interactions between matter and radiation, but not in elementary processes such as absorption and emission. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> one to reconcile the discontinuously changing energy of the atom (the jump between energy states) with the continuous release of energy as radiation.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} changes to the bullet-shooting crossbow was the strong, upwardly curved bow. <b>This</b> <b>allowed</b> the strings and pouch, which hold and launch the bullet, to be placed away {{from the rest of the}} gun. <b>This</b> <b>allowed</b> for a straighter stock or body of the crossbow, which utilizes stronger springs to launch bullets faster and more accurately.|$|R
5|$|Histamines are {{proteins}} {{associated with}} many allergic reactions. When the UV radiation or light {{comes in contact}} with a person with solar urticaria, histamine is released from mast cells. When this occurs, the permeability of vessels near the area of histamine release is increased. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> blood fluid to enter the vessels and cause inflammation. Antihistamines suppress {{the activity of the}} histamine.|$|E
5|$|If no ethnographic nor {{historical}} data are found which can support this assertion then {{acceptance of the}} idea relies upon {{whether or not there}} are enough petroglyph sites in North America that such a correlation could occur by chance. It is helpful when petroglyphs are associated with existing peoples. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> ethnoastronomers to question informants as to the meaning of such symbols.|$|E
5|$|In each case, these {{simplified}} models display many of {{the issues}} that have to be handled in practice. Constraint satisfaction problems, which generalize graph homomorphism problems, can express various additional types of conditions (such as individual preferences, or bounds on the number of coinciding assignments). <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> the models to be made more realistic and practical.|$|E
50|$|Numbers were {{represented}} as 30-bit words, <b>this</b> <b>allowed</b> for five 6-bit alphanumeric characters per word.|$|R

5|$|Prokaryotes {{control their}} use of these {{electron}} donors and acceptors by varying which enzymes are produced, in response to environmental conditions. This flexibility is possible because different oxidases and reductases use the same ubiquinone pool. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> many combinations of enzymes to function together, linked by the common ubiquinol intermediate. These respiratory chains therefore have a modular design, with easily interchangeable sets of enzyme systems.|$|E
5|$|Students {{will receive}} {{advanced}} standing from the SIT overseas university (OU) partners {{as most of}} the applicants have received prior relevant education in polytechnic. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> full-time students to finish a full-length degree programme in a span of 2 or 2.5 years instead of between 3 and 4 years.|$|E
5|$|The Paris–Roubaix Cyclo is {{organised}} by the Velo Club de Roubaix {{every other}} June. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> amateurs {{to experience the}} cobbles, the finishing laps in the vélodrome, and the showers. There is a choice of three levels: 120km, most of the cobbled sectors; 190km all the cobbles; or the full 261km. All finishers receive a small cobblestone on a wooden plinth.|$|E

5|$|The {{functionality}} of a USB {{device is}} defined by a class code sent to a USB host. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> the host to load software modules for the device and to support new devices from different manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>allows</b> more {{resources}} to be allocated to more intensive strategies focusing on higher risk entities, providing an incentive to entities {{to want to be}} seen to be compliant. The robustness of the risk assessments, {{and the quality of the}} data on which the assessments rely, are therefore very important.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>allows</b> {{the host}} to perform bus {{management}} action like enumerating new USB devices via retrieving the new device device descriptors. Retrieval {{of the device}} descriptors would especially allow for determining the USB Class, VID, and PID, which are often used for determining the correct USB driver for the device.|$|E
