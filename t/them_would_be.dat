5|$|Allied forces {{then began}} {{preparing}} for the invasion of mainland Japan, Operation Downfall. I Corps was assigned as one of four Corps {{under the command of}} the Sixth Army, with a strength of 14 divisions. I Corps was to lead the assault on Miyazaki, in southern Kyūshū, with the 25th, 33rd, and 41st Infantry Divisions. Opposing <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the Japanese 57th Army, with the 154th, 156th, and 212th Japanese Infantry Divisions. Before the assault could be launched, Japan surrendered, following the use of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|Furious {{with the}} marriage, Babli's family asked for {{intervention}} {{from the local}} khap panchayat, which annulled the marriage. The khap also announced a social boycott on Manoj's family. Anyone who kept ties with <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fined ₨25,000. Ompati tried to persuade her family that Babli did nothing dishonourable and that she and Manoj would move back home soon.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} suit the modern sensibility, several changes were introduced. Akhtar changed a number of aspects of the climax as he felt the {{original}} ending was outdated for today's audiences. On the other hand, a number of elements from the original were retained in the new film, notably the background score, two songs, some dialogue, and some situations, all of which Akhtar believed were fine in the original, saying that not including <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a crime.|$|E
5|$|Major General William Bridges {{decided that}} the Duntroon cadets, none of whom had yet {{finished}} their training, should be split up and posted to the various units of the AIF as regimental rather than staff officers. Robertson was posted to the 10th Light Horse as its machine-gun officer. He was one of seven members of his class in the 3rd Light Horse Brigade. By the end of August 1915, three of <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> dead.|$|E
5|$|The Khap panchayat's {{ruling was}} based on the {{assumption}} that Manoj and Babli belonged to the Banwala gotra, a Jat community, and were therefore considered to be siblings despite not being directly related and any union between <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> invalid and incestuous. Nevertheless, the couple went ahead with their marriage, following which they were abducted and killed by Babli's relatives.|$|E

5|$|The {{critical}} {{decision for}} the Saigon government was made two days later at Cam Ranh Bay during a meeting between Thiệu and General Phu. Thiệu decided that Pleiku and Kon Tum were to be abandoned and that the forces defending <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> redeployed to retake demographically more important Ban Mê Thuột. Phu informed the president that the only route possible for the redeployment, given PAVN blocking actions, was little-used Interprovincial Route 7B, a neglected, narrow, rough-surfaced track (actually a logging road) with several downed bridges along its course.|$|E
5|$|The partisans arrested Mussolini {{and took}} him to Dongo, where he spent part of the night in the local barracks.

5|$|Tucker and Allie Clark both {{attempted}} to make the Indians roster to begin the 1951 season, as the additions of Harry Simpson and Minnie Miñoso made it likely that {{one or both of}} <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> traded or released. Tucker played only one game for the Indians, on April 29 when he recorded a strikeout in his lone at-bat. In early May, the Indians sent him to their Triple-A minor league affiliate, the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League; his last major league game was April 29.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, he {{reported}} preliminary cytological {{studies on the}} Aspleniums and suggested that A.montanum had crossed with ebony spleenwort (A.platyneuron) to yield Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi), noting that D. C. Eaton and W. N. Clute had already made tentative suggestions along those lines. He also made chromosome counts of A.×trudellii, which had been classified by some simply as a variety of A.pinnatifidum. As A.pinnatifidum {{proved to be a}} tetraploid while A.montanum was a diploid, a hybrid between <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a triploid, and Wagner showed that this was in fact the case for A.×trudellii. His further experiments, published the following year, strongly suggested that both A.bradleyi and A.pinnatifidum were allotetraploids, the product of hybridization between A.montanum and another Asplenium to form a sterile diploid, followed by chromosome doubling that restored fertility.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's wife, Shelley (Mädchen Amick), is at {{home when}} he returns and assaults her. He drives her to the sawmill, ties her up, and rigs a timed device that will set the {{building}} on fire. Meanwhile, Packard meets with recently paroled Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey) to give him US$90,000; it is revealed Packard paid Jennings to serve eighteen months in prison. This ensured that neither of <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> implicated {{in the death of}} Packard's husband, from whom she inherited the mill. Jennings later calls Martell to lure her to the mill. As Martell arrives, the device explodes, engulfing the building in flames. At the same time, Johnson attempts to kill Shelley's lover, Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook), but is shot by Jennings.|$|E
5|$|The first Vietnamese {{refugee camp}} was opened in Pulau Bidong in August 1978 with United Nations assistance; the island {{accommodated}} up to 25,000 refugees. Other refugee camps {{were set up}} at Pulau Tengah, Pulau Besar, Kota Bharu, Kuantan, Sarawak and Sabah. In 1982, a transit centre was established at Sungei Besi, where refugees awaiting deportation to Western countries that were willing to accept <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> housed. The number of Vietnamese refugee arrivals fluctuated between 1981 and 1983, before a period of significant decrease from 1984 to 1986. In 1987, Malaysia and other neighbouring countries saw a sudden {{increase in the number}} of Vietnamese refugees landing in Malaysia. At an ASEAN summit in June 1987, member countries chastised the Vietnamese government for not having sufficiently addressed the refugee problem.|$|E

5|$|To {{expand the}} {{connection}} between Terra and Riku, scenes foreshadowing future events involving Riku from Terra's perspective {{were added to the}} game, though Nomura has stated that these scenes are not of a precognitive nature. Nomura expects that in future games, {{the connection between}} both of <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> expanded. Ryōtarō Okiayu was chosen as Terra's Japanese voice actor as the staff wanted one actor similar to Chikao Ōtsuka, Xehanort's voice actor, and Akio Ōtsuka, Xehanort's voice actor while using Terra's body. The staff found Chikao's was a dry sort of voice, Akio's a deep, resonating sort of voice, and liked how Okiayu bore elements from both actors.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, the {{receivers}} granted a two-year exclusivity period to their preferred bidder, the British Virgin Islands-registered investment vehicle Trillion Trophy Asia (TTA), wholly owned by Chinese businessman Paul Suen Cho Hung. After striking {{deals with the}} previous major shareholders such that legal action against <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> dropped {{in return for their}} agreement not to obstruct any transfer of ownership, {{the receivers}} released a document in June 2016 setting out a timescale for the company restructure, share relisting and takeover, to be completed by the end of October. It confirmed that Suen would hold 60.78% of BIH shares and the Yeung faction no more than 14%, and that the company would not be sold on within two years. The process completed on 17 October, leaving TTA owning 50.64% of BIH's share capital, a level of ownership that required them to make an offer for the remainder.|$|E
5|$|Royall and Marbury envisaged {{nuclear energy}} being {{controlled}} by experts, {{with a minimum}} of political interference. The commissioners would be appointed for indefinite terms, and the President's power to remove <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> limited. They would be supported by four advisory boards, for military applications, industrial uses, research and medicine, the membership of which would be restricted to those with technical qualifications. Day-to-day running of the organization would {{be in the hands of}} an administrator and his deputy. The Royall–Marbury Bill was reviewed by the Interim Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki lifted the veil of secrecy surrounding the Manhattan Project, Royall and Marbury were able to consult with the Attorney General, the Judge Advocate General and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The draft was sent to the President in August for circulation among, and comment from, affected government agencies. Only the State Department had objections, on the basis that it was still involved in trying to hammer out an international agreement on nuclear energy.|$|E

5|$|The team of Curry Man and Shark Boy were {{pitted against}} Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray), who were {{accompanied}} by Johnny Devine, in a thirteen-minute-and-twelve-second Fish Market Street Fight. Prior to this bout, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that if Team 3D made weight, then the weight restriction on <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> lifted. Also, that Kurt Angle originally won the Six Sides of Steel Cage match against Christian Cage, however the decision with The Unlikely Alliance gaining the advantage in the Six Man Tag Team match was still in effect. Before the bout, both members of Team 3D were weighed, with both coming in below the mark. In a Fish Market Street Fight the match is won by pinfall or submission, {{in which there are}} no disqualifications and the ring area is covered by fish paraphernalia. Devine interfered in the match near the end, accidentally throwing white powder in Ray's face. This led to Shark Boy tossing him out of the ring and through a table. Afterwards, Ray mistakenly performed Team 3D's signature tag team maneuver the 3D on Devon with Curry Man, allowing Shark Boy to cover for the pinfall victory.|$|E
