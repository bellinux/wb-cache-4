The concept of agricultural land management within an intensive system of agriculture was the basis for developing at Fundulea, on a leached chernozem, experiments meant to study the effects of modern crop management, with the aim of maintaining a high yield level. The studies carried out referred to: the relationship between annual rainfalls and yields achieved, infection of wheat grains at harvesting with Fusarium spp. and the evolution of floristic composition of weeds in win-ter wheat in different crop rotations for a period of 25 years. Determinations regarding weed infestation were made in wheat monoculture and rotations of 2 - 3 - 4 years (wheat- maize, wheat- maize- peas respectively wheat-sugar beet — maize- sunflower) at the beginning of April and in July (at harvesting). After 25 years of experiments, weed infestation decreased very much within the rotations studied (monoculture = 100 %; <b>two-years</b> <b>rotation</b> = 36 %; three years rotation = 17 %; four-years rotation = 5 %).

5000|$|If available, {{choosing}} a maize hybrid that is resistant to gray leaf spot {{is the most}} cost-effective way to control the disease. No maize hybrid is completely immune to gray leaf spot, but there are varieties that have very good levels of resistance. Most seed companies have a gray leaf spot resistance rating for their hybrids that are available. As far as controlling Pyricularia grisea, ryegrass, tall fescue, and St. Augustinegrass are all fairly susceptible to gray leaf spot and neither of them are considered resistant. Planting other types of grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass, bentgrass, or annual bluegrass {{would be a lot}} more beneficial as they are not affected by gray leaf spot. Managing crop residue is another important thing to keep in mind when trying to control gray leaf spot. Continuous corn and a no-till or reduced tillage system are at a very high risk for disease development because of the amount of residue being left on the soil surface. Rotating crops away from corn followed by tillage is recommended to prevent disease in the subsequent crop. In fields with a history of grey leaf spot with a no-till system, a <b>two-year</b> <b>rotation</b> may be needed. [...] Using fungicides effectively can also reduce the amount of diseased crops and help stop the spread of gray leaf spot. Some research has shown that strobilurin and strobilurin/triazole fungicides are the most effective at preventing yield loss from the disease.

In the semi-arid regions of Southern India, farmers traditionally crop sorghum or chickpea on Vertisols during the post-rainy season, keeping the fields fallow {{during the rainy season}}. This practice avoids land management problems, but limits the potential for crop intensification to increase systems productivity. A long-term (15 year) experiment at ICRISAT demonstrated that cropping during the rainy season is technically feasible, and that grain productivity of double cropped sorghum + chickpea (SCP–SCP) and mung bean + sorghum (MS–MS) sequential systems were higher than their conventional counterparts with rainy season fallow, i. e. fallow + post-rainy sorghum (FS–FS) and fallow + post-rainy chickpea (FS–FCP). Without N application, mean grain yield of post-rainy sorghum in the MS–MS system was significantly greater (2520 kg ha− 1 per <b>two-year</b> <b>rotation)</b> than in the FS–FS system (1940 kg ha− 1 per <b>two-year</b> <b>rotation),</b> with the added benefit of the mung bean grain yield (1000 kg ha− 1 per <b>two-year</b> <b>rotation)</b> from the MS–MS system. In the SCP–SCP system the additional grain yield of rainy sorghum (3400 kg ha− 1 per <b>two-year</b> <b>rotation)</b> ensured that the total productivity of this system was greater than all other systems. Double cropping MS–MS and SCP–SCP sequential systems had significantly higher crop N uptake compared to traditional fallow systems at all rates of applied nitrogen (N). The intensified MS–MS and SCP–SCP sequential systems without any N fertilizer applied recorded a much higher median gross profit of Rs. 20, 600 (US 375) and Rs. 15, 930 (US 290) ha− 1 yr− 1, respectively, compared to Rs. 1560 (US 28) ha− 1 yr− 1) with the FS–FS system. Applying 120 kg of N ha− 1 considerably increased the profitability of all systems, lifting median gross profits of the sorghum + chickpea system over Rs. 60, 000 (US 1091) ha− 1 yr− 1 and the conventional system to Rs. 20, 570 (US 374) ha− 1 yr− 1. The gross profit margin analysis showed that nitrogen is a key input for improving productivity, particularly for the double cropping systems. However, traditional systems are unviable and risky without N application in the variable climates of the semi-arid tropics.

40|$|The {{adoption}} {{and use of}} diversified cropping practices has become widely accepted by producers. However, the profitability of an enterprise {{is dependent on the}} biophysical and economic factors. The biophysical factors determine the enterprise relationship among the various crops, their interactions with the ecosystem, and how each of them fits into the overall management plan. The economic factors determine the relative advantage of each crop and service in the farm plan. Although there have been experimental studies in Canada examining the impacts of rotations on the agronomics of field crops, there is limited research in modeling economic and environmental dynamics of the potato production system. Potato production in Manitoba has rapidly increased in recent years and became the second largest potato producer in Canada producing about 22. 2 % of the total Canada's potato production as of 2004. Alberta has had similar expansion with the highest yield per acre in Canada. The expansion of potato industry in these two provinces and other parts of Canada has created some concerns about agro-environmental indicators such as water contamination, soil erosion and long-term profitability of potato production practices. The objective {{of this study was to}} address some of these concerns and develop a dynamic model that integrates environmental and economic components of potato production systems and estimates sustainability of some of the agricultural practices. A Stella Modeling framework was developed to provide crop production and environmental input to an economic model of potato rotations. The economic performance of different potato rotations ranging from two to four years in duration, and containing potatoes in combination with oilseed, cereal, forage, and legume crops was evaluated based on standard budgeting techniques. Net income was estimated as the income remaining above cash costs (i. e., seed, fertilizer, chemical, fuel and oil, repairs, crop insurance premium, miscellaneous, land taxes, and interest cost on variable inputs), ownership costs (depreciation, interest on investment, and insurance and housing) for machinery and grain storage, and labour. All annual inputs used in each phase of rotation for each management treatment, the type and frequency of field operation, year and replicate including pre-plant activities, tillage, fertilization, planting, insects and pests control, harvesting, storage, and transportation were included in the analysis. Modelling the economics of irrigated potato rotations required input from an agro-environmental model. This agro-environmental model was developed to simulate nutrient dynamics, soil moisture dynamics, soil characteristics and erosion, soil organic matter content, residue decomposition, and crop growth. The economic model takes into account economic factors and costs that are influenced by yield function, nutrients and crop water thus establishing the link between the agro-environmental module and the economic module. Farm operation costs in our model are divided into two categories: dependent costs and base costs. Dependent costs are costs that are controlled by the agro-environmental module, including yield dependent costs, irrigation dependent costs and fertilizer dependent costs. Base costs were developed through experimental evaluation with E-Views and remain constant throughout the rotation. On the agro-environmental side, the model outputs the changes in soil organic matter, soil loss due to erosion, and carbon dioxide emission due to decomposition and mineralization. Results of the model show that changes in these variables are dependent upon the length of, and the crops involved in, the rotation. The economic model results showed highest average net revenue was found in shorter <b>two-year</b> <b>rotations</b> due to the greater frequency of potato. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R

Precipitation in the region ranges from 300 to 500 mm annually, with the majority of precipitation falling during hot summer months. The prevailing cropping system is a <b>two-year</b> <b>rotation</b> of wheat and summer fallow. The adoption of no-till practices has resulted in greater precipitation storage and use efficiency, which has led to greater cropping intensity, higher productivity, more diverse crop rotations, and improvements in soil properties.

Soil erosion was reduced to just 25 % of that from a conventional tillage wheat–summer fallow system. The primary challenge with reducing fallow frequency is the increase in yield variability and risk of crop failure. Improved approaches for choosing crop or fallow are being developed based on soil water content and forecasted weather. Development of alternative crops, crop rotations, and integrated livestock systems that are sustainable from both economic and ecological perspectives is an on-going effort. Other research is addressing adaptation of cropping practices to climate change and the potential for dryland biomass crop production for the developing biofuel industry...|$|E
40|$|A two-year {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess how mulch influences weed dynamics following imposition of different fertilization treatments under three crop establishment options: (i) conventional; (ii) ripping; and (iii) basin, in a <b>two-year</b> maize-legume <b>rotation.</b> Eight treatments were imposed within each crop establishment option and received maize stover mulch applied at 0 % or 30 % cover before planting  maize (Zea mays) or cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) as test crops. Maize received nitrogen (N) at 35, 90, or 120 kg·ha− 1 and phosphorus (P) at 14 or 26 kg·ha− 1 applied alone or in combination with 4 or 7 t cattle manure·ha− 1, while cowpea received 8 or 17 N·kg·ha− 1 and similar P rates to maize. Results indicated that both weed biomass and diversity were influenced more by fertilization than method of crop establishment. On treatments under high fertilizer application rates, or previously planted to cowpea weed biomass ranged between 220 and 400 g·m− 2 under mulch and 370 – 510 g·m− 2 (no mulch). Here species richness ranged between 7 – 16 and was dominated by dicotyledons. This was in contrast to biomass ranges of 75 – 200 g·m− 2 in the low fertilized and control plots, where only one or two grass types dominated. Overall, weed densities were 6 % to 51 % higher under conventional tillage compared to the two conservation agriculture (CA) options, although the data indicated that mulch significantly (p < 0. 05) depressed weed density by up to 70 %. We concluded that mulching could be a potential mechanism for reducing weeding labor costs for smallholders and the general environmental and health concerns {{associated with the use of}} herbicides in CA systems...|$|R
40|$|Livestock {{and crop}} {{producers}} can reduce or even eliminate purchases of commercial nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) by taking proper credit for manure nutrients applied to their fields. The N, P, and K {{value of the}} manure generated annually by a 100 -sow farrow-to-finish operation can be worth over $ 8, 000 {{at the time it}} is hauled to the field. (Note that the cost of transporting manure to the field or land applying the manure to cropland is not included here.) Producers can profit from these manure nutrients on their own cropland or by selling the manure to neighboring crop farmers. Replacement Strategy The fertilizer bill for a 150 bu/acre corn crop is approximately $ 100 /acre if only the value of the N applied and the P and K removed by the crop are considered. A 50 bu/acre soybean crop removes approximately $ 40 of P and K per acre. Because manure contains more P and K relative to N based on corn crop removal, manure applied to corn based on crop N needs generally contains enough P and K to fertilize a second crop with both nutrients. Therefore, in a <b>two-year</b> corn-soybean <b>rotation,</b> the manure applied to a corn crop can easily be worth $ 140 /acre by eliminating the need for commercial N, P, and K for both the corn and soybean crops. Ideally, you should apply manure based on its plant-available N (PAN) content and place it on fields that test low for P and K so that crop production fields can benefit from the added P and K. To maximize manure nutrient value, you need three things: a manure nutrient analysis, application equipment that can apply manure at the desired PAN rate, and soil test reports to determine which fields will benefit most from the P and K present in the manure. Manure Testing A complete manure analysis from a soil testing laboratory that includes total N, ammonium N, phosphate (P 2...|$|R
40|$|Collinsville, Illinois is {{the leading}} {{producer}} of horseradish is the nation. The river bottom geography surrounding Collinsville, Illinois near St. Louis, Missouri is a high-production area for horseradish. The development of soybean technologies resistant to dicamba or 2, 4 -D may allow horseradish growers {{to gain control of}} troublesome weeds, such as Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) or volunteer horseradish, but could pose risks as well. Drift of these two herbicides or carryover to horseradish could cause severe injury and possible crop loss. While synthetic auxin-tolerant soybean may also allow growers to control volunteer horseradish, herbicide efficacy may differ depending on the volunteer horseradish variety. These risks and benefits could affect the adoption rate of these new soybean technologies in horseradish production areas. A field trial was established in 2015 in Edwardsville, IL and 2016 Medora, IL to simulate drift of both dicamba and 2, 4 -D onto horseradish. Applications were made in horseradish to mimic drift of a mid-post emergence application in soybean onto the horseradish crop. Plants were monitored for injury and stand, height, and yield reductions throughout the season. Individual roots were evaluated post-harvest. Overall, 2, 4 -D caused more injury at all rates when compared to dicamba. Horseradish growers may see yield reductions if rates at or greater than 1 / 1000 X of a field rate of 2, 4 -D drift onto their fields. Not planting horseradish near a 2, 4 -D-tolerant soybean field, as well as reading the herbicide labels and following application requirements, should help growers prevent serious injury and yield loss. On the other hand, rates of 2, 4 -D at or above a full field rate offered complete control of all plants; therefore, growers who struggle with persistent volunteer horseradish could rotate to a 2, 4 -D-tolerant soybean and gain needed control of those plants. Field experiments were conducted in 2014, 2015, and 2016 to investigate the impact of dicamba residues following applications in a dicamba-tolerant soybean crop on horseradish planted the following season. Carryover trials were conducted as <b>two-year</b> <b>rotations</b> of soybean followed by horseradish in Collinsville, Illinois. Multiple rates of dicamba were applied at several timings in dicamba-tolerant soybean and the crop was monitored for injury. The following season horseradish was planted and monitored for injury and stand, height, and yield reductions. No injury or reductions were observed with any treatment in either year, potentially indicating a lack of dicamba remaining in the soil. Horseradish plant stand counts, height as well as yields were not reduced when compared to the nontreated. Results from this experiment suggest that rotating from dicamba-tolerant soybean to horseradish should pose no threat to horseradish. Greenhouse experiments were carried out in 2016 in three separate runs. Each run consisted of three replications of five varieties of horseradish, 604, 788, 9705, Hungarian, and V 7 E 3, and two rates of dicamba, glyphosate, and dicamba plus glyphosate. Plants were sprayed when at least one plant in each pot had reached a height of 17 to 23 cm. Horseradish was then rated for injury at 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after treatment (DAT). Heights were also taken at 0, 14, and 28 DAT. At 28 DAT plants were harvested, weighed and place in a dryer for 72 hours and weighed again. The lowest level of injury at 28 DAT was with variety 604. The control of horseradish roots is critical to ensure the plant is killed completely and does not return the following season as a volunteer. The concerns associated with auxin-tolerant crops can be mitigated with proper management of herbicides and crop locations. While off target movement of 2, 4 -D may cause damage to a horseradish crop, it {{could be used as a}} herbicide to control volunteer horseradish. Additionally, if a grower chooses to use a dicamba-tolerant soybean variety, they may have the choice to use a dicamba plus glyphosate premix which will also give good control of volunteer horseradish with little concerns of dicamba carryover to the subsequent horseradish crop. Capitalizing on the strengths and weaknesses of each technology will help horseradish growers manage many weeds and facilitate the production of this important specialty crop...|$|R
