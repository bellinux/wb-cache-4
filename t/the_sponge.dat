5|$|Sponge flies, {{also known}} as spongilla-flies (Neuroptera, Sisyridae), are {{specialist}} predators of freshwater sponges. The female lays her eggs on vegetation overhanging water. The larvae hatch and drop into the water where they seek out sponges to feed on. They use their elongated mouthparts to pierce <b>the</b> <b>sponge</b> and suck the fluids within. The larvae of some species cling {{to the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>sponge</b> while others take refuge in the sponge's internal cavities. The fully grown larvae leave the water and spin a cocoon in which to pupate.|$|E
5|$|In {{anaerobic}} protozoa, such as Plagiopyla frontata, archaea reside {{inside the}} protozoa and consume hydrogen produced in their hydrogenosomes. Archaea also associate with larger organisms. For example, the marine archaean Cenarchaeum symbiosum lives within (is an endosymbiont of) <b>the</b> <b>sponge</b> Axinella mexicana.|$|E
5|$|Caribbean sponges of {{the genus}} Aplysina suffer from Aplysina red band syndrome. This causes Aplysina to develop one or more rust-colored bands, {{sometimes}} with adjacent bands of necrotic tissue. These lesions may completely encircle branches of <b>the</b> <b>sponge.</b> The disease appears to be contagious and impacts approximately 10 percent of A. cauliformis on Bahamian reefs. The rust-colored bands are caused by a cyanobacterium, but it is unknown whether this organism actually causes the disease.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{series of}} cellulose/soy protein isolate (SPI) sponges was {{prepared}} using a freeze-drying process.

30|$|The {{difference}} in the microbial community structure of <b>the</b> <b>sponges</b> was more evident from the PCoA plot based on the weighted unifrac distances (Fig.  2). Our analysis showed that microbial community structure of <b>the</b> two <b>sponges</b> was significantly (ANOVA, p ≤  0.0001) different from each other. Studies have shown that, the origin and habitat of <b>the</b> <b>sponges</b> play very important role in establishing the microbial community structure (Cleary et al. 2013). Our study also supported these observations as the physiochemical parameters measured for the habitat (water) of the two species of sponges showed significant differences (Additional file 1 : Table S 2) supporting the possible role played by habitat in establishing the microbial community structure. PCoA plot also showed that the microbiota of <b>the</b> <b>sponges</b> was significantly different from their respective water samples. Additionally, Venn diagram analysis of OTUs showed that, <b>the</b> <b>sponges</b> harboured {{a large number of}} unique OTUs compared to each other and its respective water samples (Fig.  3). The distinct microbial community structure of <b>the</b> <b>sponges,</b> compared to its surrounding water samples also implicates the influence of the host genetic factors in structuring the microbial community structure of <b>the</b> <b>sponges</b> (Costa et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|Cellulose based sponges were {{developed}} by freeze-drying of regenerated cellulose gels and characterizedas a potential wound dressing. Morphological characteristics were analyzed by means of micro-computedtomography. The {{results showed that the}} porosity of <b>the</b> <b>sponges</b> reached 75 %, the pores were inter-connected and their size ranged from 10 to 1200 m with a mean pore diameter of 750 m. Due tohydrophilicity of cellulose and high specific surface area (14. 5 mm 2 /mm 3) <b>the</b> <b>sponges</b> possess highsorption of simulated wound fluids (approx. 210 %) and high water vapour transmission ability. Dif-ferent active compounds, such as polyphenols from Calendula officinalis or Chamomilla recutita extracts(1 day diffusion experiment), silver nanoparticles (1, 2 and 4 days diffusion experiments) were immo-bilized into <b>the</b> <b>sponges</b> in order to improve wound dressing performance. Release kinetics of silvernanoparticles and polyphenols from <b>the</b> <b>sponges</b> were investigated. <b>The</b> <b>sponges</b> incorporated with sil-ver, showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis.

5|$|The spiny scallop {{usually has}} a {{symbiotic}} relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on its left valve. This is most often the orange Myxilla incrustans but is sometimes the purple or brown Mycale adherens. <b>The</b> <b>sponge</b> provides camouflage for the scallop and may deter predators from attacking it as sponges often produce a repulsive odour and tend to be distasteful. It also {{makes it more difficult}} for a starfish to get the strong grip with its tube feet that it needs to force the two valves of the scallop apart.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sponge</b> {{benefits}} {{from the fact that}} living on the scallop prevents it from being buried in sediment. In the wild it has been found that the scallops and their encrusting sponges both grow to a larger size in areas of high turbidity. A laboratory study showed that, in conditions where the sediment was frequently stirred up, sponges on empty scallop shells all died while those on living shells flourished. However, another study showed that growth rates in scallops heavily encrusted by sponges were significantly lower than in unencumbered ones.|$|E

40|$|Sponges {{composed}} of sodium alginate and chitosan were prepared via a freeze drying process {{in order to}} assess the utility of mixed sponges as potential wound dressings or matrices for tissue engineering. Sponge preparation involved dissolving both polymers (either individually or mixed) in 1 % acetic acid and freeze-drying the corresponding solutions. The mechanical properties of <b>the</b> <b>sponges</b> were assessed using texture analysis and the microstructure examined using scanning electron microscopy. The dissolution of a model drug (paracetamol) from <b>the</b> <b>sponges</b> was assessed as a function of polysaccharide composition. It was noted that <b>the</b> <b>sponges</b> had a flexible yet strong texture, as assessed macroscopically. Measurement of the resistance to compression (‘hardness’) indicated that <b>the</b> chitosan <b>sponges</b> were <b>the</b> ‘hardest’ while <b>the</b> alginate <b>sponges</b> showed <b>the</b> least resistance to compression, with all sponges showing a high degree of recovery. In contrast, the breaking force (tensile force) of <b>the</b> <b>sponges</b> were greatest for the single component systems, while the elongation prior to breaking was similar for each material. SEM studies indicated that the mixed systems had a less well-defined microstructure than <b>the</b> single component <b>sponges.</b> This was ascribed to the two polysaccharides interacting in aqueous solution via coulombic forces, leading to a more randomly ordered network being formed on freezing. Dissolution studies indicated that systems containing chitosan alone showed the slowest release profile, with the mixed systems showing a relatively rapid dissolution profile. The use of chitosan and alginates together, therefore, appears to allow the formulator to manipulate both the mechanical properties and the drug release properties of <b>the</b> <b>sponges...</b>|$|R

25|$|Some scallops, {{including}} Chlamys hastata, frequently carry epibionts such as sponges and barnacles {{on their}} shell. The relationship of <b>the</b> <b>sponge</b> to the scallop is {{characterized as a}} form of mutualism, because <b>the</b> <b>sponge</b> provides protection by interfering with adhesion of predatory sea-star tube feet, camouflages Chlamys hastata from predators, or forms a physical barrier around byssal openings to prevent sea stars from inserting their digestive membranes. Sponge encrustation protects C. hastata from barnacle larvae settlement, serving as a protection from epibionts that increase susceptibility to predators. Thus, barnacle larvae settlement will occur more frequently on sponge-free shells than sponge-encrusted shells.|$|E
25|$|Aquaculture {{production}} of C. matthewsi sponges was {{undertaken by the}} Marine and Environmental Research Institute of Pohnpei (MERIP), to try and generate a sustainable income for local community residents with few options to earn money.
