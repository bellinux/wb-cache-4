Lee, the Board recommended <b>that</b> <b>Key</b> Biscayne be made a military reservation, and the United States Secretary of War so ordered in March 1849. Later that year, the United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers set up a camp with an astronomical/magnetic station {{to serve as a}} datum base for a survey of the Florida Keys and the Great Florida Reef.|$|E

5|$|The British {{policy as}} stated in the {{declaration}} was to face numerous challenges to its implementation in the following years. The first of these was the indirect peace negotiations which took place between Britain and the Ottomans in December 1917 and January 1918 during a pause in the hostilities for the rainy season; although these peace talks were unsuccessful, archival records suggest <b>that</b> <b>key</b> members of the War Cabinet may have been willing to permit leaving Palestine under nominal Turkish sovereignty as part of an overall deal.|$|E
5|$|Theobald Boehm did not {{directly}} invent the key system of the clarinet. Boehm was a flautist who created the key system that is now used for the transverse flute. Klosé and Buffet applied Boehm's system to the clarinet. Although the credit goes to those people, Boehm's name was given to <b>that</b> <b>key</b> system because {{it was based on}} that used for flute.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of Kanon, the Key staff started production on Air and expanded {{the number of people}} involved in this project compared to Kanon. The executive producer for Air was Takahiro Baba from VisualArt's, the publishing company <b>that</b> <b>Key</b> is under. The planning for Air was headed by Jun Maeda who was also one of two main scenario writers, the other being Takashi Ishikawa. Scenario assistance was provided by four more people: Kazuki Fujii, Kai, Tōya Okano, and Yūichi Suzumoto. Art direction was headed by Key's artist Itaru Hinoue who worked on the character design. Further computer graphics were split between three people—Miracle Mikipon, Na-Ga, and Shinory—and background art was provided by Din and Torino. The music in the game was composed primarily by Shinji Orito, Jun Maeda, and Magome Togoshi, who had started working with Key since before Kanons release. After {{the completion}} of Air, two of the staff—Kazuki Fujii, and Takashi Ishikawa—left Key.|$|E

5|$|At {{a luncheon}} with the St. John's Board of Trade in February 2012, Dunderdale {{delivered}} a speech which {{laid out a}} more fiscally conservative course. She stated that the days of big spending were over {{and that it was}} time to rein in public spending. Dunderdale said that there would be virtually no new spending in the upcoming provincial budget, that government departments were told to find savings and that she had ordered an audit of all government programs. She also said that her goal in the next decade is to radically decrease Newfoundland and Labrador's debt load and to achieve the same per capita debt as the Canadian average. Fiscal restraint was again the key message in the March 5, 2011, speech from the throne. The speech announced that all government departments and programs were under review. Dunderdale later stated that her government was looking for $100 million in savings for the upcoming fiscal year and <b>that</b> <b>key</b> services were exempt from cuts.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the only}} other {{scenario}} writer on the project was Yūto Tonokawa of Key, who previously contributed on Key's sixth game Little Busters!. Tanaka was tasked with drawing up the entire scenario framework, and during this time, Takahiro Baba suggested that one more heroine route {{be added to the}} story to bring the total to six, but to do that they had to hire another writer. Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion, the creators of the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Umineko no Naku Koro ni game franchises, was brought in as the third scenario writer after Baba suggested in late 2007 <b>that</b> <b>Key</b> ask him to join the staff for Rewrite. Ultimately, Tanaka wrote the story leading up to the heroine's routes, Kotori's and Akane's scanarios, the Moon and Terra routes, and the bonus Oppai route. Tonokawa wrote Chihaya's and Sizuru's routes, and Ryukishi07 wrote Lucia's story. Tanaka initially planned on the length of Rewrites story to be on about the same scale as Key's second game Air, but as it increased in size, he later attempted to keep it close to the scale of Little Busters!.|$|E
5|$|In , the {{caretaker}} government approved plans to turn Biman {{into a public}} limited company with shareholdings split between seven public sector organisations. As {{a part of the}} restructuring, the government put in place a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) to reduce the man-equipment ratio (MER) of 367:1 (ratio of manpower to aircraft). The industry average at the time was 200:1, and other Asian airlines operated with MERs of about 150:1. The VRS provided compensation based on length of service, at a cost to the government of over BDT2.97billion borrowed from the World Bank. Biman management expected to reduce its workforce by 1,600, but 2,162applications were received, many from employees who expected to be dismissed with little or no severance pay if the quota was not met. Biman accepted between 1,863 and 1877 applications, and affirmed <b>that</b> <b>key</b> personnel {{would not be allowed to}} leave the organisation via VRS.|$|E

40|$|This study uses conjuring to {{investigate}} the effects of suggestion, social influence and paranormal belief upon the accuracy of eyewitness testimony for an ostensibly paranormal event. Participants watched a video of an alleged psychic seemingly bending a metal key {{by the power of}} psychokinesis. Half the participants heard the fake psychic suggest <b>that</b> the <b>key</b> continued to bend after it had been put down on a table and half did not. Additionally, participants were exposed to either a negative social influence (a stooge co-witness reporting <b>that</b> the <b>key</b> did not continue to bend), no social influence, or a positive social influence (a stooge co-witness reporting <b>that</b> the <b>key</b> did continue to bend). Participants who were exposed to the verbal suggestion {{were significantly more likely to}} report <b>that</b> the <b>key</b> continued to bend. Additionally, more participants reported <b>that</b> the <b>key</b> continued to bend in the positive social influence condition compared to the other two social influence conditions. Finally, believers in the paranormal were more likely to report <b>that</b> the <b>key</b> continued to bend than non-believers...|$|R
5|$|In 1824 Mary Ann Channer Davis, who {{had moved}} to St. Augustine {{with her husband in}} 1821, bought the Fornells claim to Key Biscayne from one of the Fornells' heirs for US$100. Mary and her husband William Davis, a deputy U.S. Marshal, {{probably}} were aware of plans to build a lighthouse on the Florida coast somewhere between St. Augustine and Key West, and knew <b>that</b> <b>Key</b> Biscayne was a likely location for it. Mary and William sold three acres (about one-and-a-quarter hectares) of their newly acquired land at the southern tip of the island (Cape Florida) to the U.S. government for US$225. The federal government built the Cape Florida lighthouse on that land in 1825.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 the Air Ministry, the British {{government}} {{department responsible for}} the Royal Air Force, believed that {{in the event of}} war enemy aerial bombing of London would cause up to 200,000 casualties per week. British government commissions under Warren Fisher and Sir James Rae in 1937 and 1938 considered <b>that</b> <b>key</b> government offices should be dispersed from central London to the suburbs, and non-essential offices to the Midlands or North West. Pending this dispersal, in May 1938 Sir Hastings Ismay, then Deputy Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, ordered an Office of Works survey of Whitehall to identify a suitable site for a temporary emergency government centre. The Office concluded the most suitable site was the basement of the New Public Offices, a government building located on the corner of Horse Guards Road and Great George Street, near Parliament Square. The building now accommodates HM Treasury.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} main plot lines that the player {{will have the}} chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given {{multiple}} options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made.

After Mai's scenario is completed, a replay of her route will offer an additional choice to play through Sayuri's back-story. Jun Maeda, who worked on the scenario for Kanon, commented in March 2001 that the Japanese public may have fallen under the impression <b>that</b> <b>Key</b> makes soothing games because of Kanons influence, but Maeda affirmed that there was not one person who worked on Kanon who thought that.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1950s, Soedjatmoko and President Sukarno, {{with whom}} he had had a warm working relationship, had a falling out over the president's {{increasingly}} authoritarian policies. In 1960 Soedjatmoko co-founded and headed the Democratic League, which attempted to promote democracy in the country; he also opposed Sukarno's Guided Democracy policy. When the effort failed, Soedjatmoko went to the US and took a position as guest lecturer at Cornell University. When he returned to Indonesia in 1962, he discovered <b>that</b> <b>key</b> members of the PSI had been arrested and the party banned; both Siasat and Pedoman were closed. To avoid trouble with the government, Soedjatmoko voluntarily left himself unemployed until 1965, when he became co-editor of An Introduction to Indonesian Historiography.|$|E
