500|$|The city of Paterson, New Jersey, {{renamed the}} Eastside Park {{baseball}} field [...] "Larry Doby Field" [...] on June 1, 2002. The Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center has a section named the Larry Doby Wing. Of Berra, Doby said, [...] "Yogi {{was one of}} the first opposing players <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> As a catcher, Yogi talked to everybody. I finally had to tell the umpire: 'Please tell him to shut up. He asked me how my family was back in the first inning.'" [...] In 2011, the U.S. Postal Service announced that Doby would be one of the four baseball players (along with Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, and Willie Stargell) to appear on a postage stamp in 2012, as part of its [...] "Major League Baseball All-Stars" [...] series. The stamp was released July 21, 2012.|$|E
500|$|During {{the offseason}} {{preceding}} the 2015 season, De Fratus {{became involved in}} some controversy involving Phillies blogger Bill Baer and the Black Lives Matter campaign when he tweeted, [...] "I'm sick of this black vs white and men vs women garbage that's been going on. We're just people. #AllLivesMatter," [...] to which Baer responded with a scathing column on Crashburn Alley, a blog affiliated with ESPN, in which he stated that De Fratus is [...] "complicit in perpetuating a system which inflicts violence on those who didn’t {{have the luxury of}} being born white and male and straight and in an economically-stable area." [...] Subsequently, De Fratus penned a retort to Baer via Facebook, in which he commented, [...] "I sincerely hope that you will take the time <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> personally next time before you decide to hide behind your computer screen and criticize me, my upbringing and my character based on 140 characters. I do not apologize for anything I have said. I have a platform and I WILL use it for the agenda of love." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2012, Hawke {{entered the}} horror genre {{for the first}} time, by playing a true crime writer in Scott Derrickson's Sinister, which grossed US$87million at the {{worldwide}} box office—the film {{was the first in}} a series of highly profitable films for Hawke after the start of the new decade. In the week prior to the US opening of Sinister, Hawke explained that he was previously turned off by horror because good acting is not always required for success; however, the producer of Sinister, Jason Blum, who formerly ran a theater company with Hawke, made the offer to the actor based on the character and director."when I was younger, I ran a theater company with this guy, Jason Blum. And he loved horror movies and he went on to create his own little subgenre with [...] "Paranormal Activity." [...] And he kept trying <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about how I should love this whole genre. And I told him: I've never had a script with a really great character and a real filmmaker attached to it that I'd be interested in. So, he brought me into it.|$|E
500|$|Xhinovci {{has come}} to believe that he is Hitler reincarnated since he began {{dressing}} as the Nazi leader. He carries numerous pieces of Nazi paraphernalia around with him, including Nazi-era Reichsmarks, swastika-emblazoned buttons, scarves embroidered with swastikas and other Nazi imagery, as well as a copy of Mein Kampf. He has business cards featuring a swastika and the word [...] "Hitler" [...] printed in bold. Locals and peacekeepers alike do not seem to mind Xhinovci's Hitler impersonations, especially as many Kosovars are too preoccupied with the country's crippling poverty and rampant corruption to give his actions much thought. On the contrary, many passersby—including some NATO peacekeepers—stop and greet him with the Nazi salute. One local told Vice News: [...] "I have {{a lot of other things}} to worry about in my life. I might look at him if he walks by, but that's it." [...] Locals apparently believe that his way of earning a living [...] "shows great enterprise". [...] "People respect me," [...] Xhinovci explains. [...] "The young and old [...] men, women and children. Everyone greets me with [...] "Heil Hitler". Xhinovci's five daughters, referred to locally as [...] "Hitler's children", are not bothered by their father's Hitler impersonations. Xhinovci reportedly attends parent-teacher conferences dressed as Hitler and says that teachers and other parents do not mind his appearance. He says that every time he goes to pick his daughters up from school he is surrounded by children who want to talk with him and take pictures. [...] "Girls like to touch my face. They think it's a mask. They pull my hair and ask if they can kiss me on the face. When I'm out of the house with my family, people stop <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But my wife is not a jealous person—she doesn't mind." ...|$|E

The owner of the pharmacy named Gacy as the contractor Piest had most likely left the store to talk with about a job.|$|E

As he released George, he said, 'Anytime you want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> just pick up the phone and come over.' It was a vintage LBJ performance." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of her career, Blackwell played mostly soubrette roles and has since moved more into the lyric coloratura soprano repertoire. Blackwell has commented that she felt opera houses were initially uncertain as to how to cast her because of her musical theater background. She said, [...] "They saw me in the lighter repertoire and my voice teacher and I saw me in the lyric repertoire." [...] In addition, her small frame and 5'1" [...] stature in combination with girlish looks made her a perfect physical casting choice for soubrette roles. It wasn't until Blackwell studied in Busseto with Carlo Bergonzi, Renata Tebaldi, and Sylvia Barrachi in the late 1980s that she finally was given direction into the lyric coloratura repertoire. Blackwell recalls, [...] "At {{the end of the program}} Mrs. Barrachi and Renata Tebaldi sat down with me and told me what roles I should sing if I wanted to have a major career. Having those two women take the time <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> made a big difference. I have always been the type of individual that takes all the information and then makes the decision that's appropriate for me. I can be very stubborn. I really do have to credit those two women for saving me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ford {{was highly}} intelligent, erudite, {{sensitive}} and sentimental, but {{to protect himself}} in the cutthroat atmosphere of Hollywood he cultivated {{the image of a}} [...] "tough, two-fisted, hard-drinking Irish sonofabitch". One famous event, witnessed by Ford's friend actor Frank Baker, strikingly illustrates the tension between the public persona and the private man. During the Depression, Ford—by then a very wealthy man—was accosted outside his office by a former Universal actor who was destitute and needed $200 for an operation for his wife. As the man related his misfortunes, Ford appeared to become enraged and then, to the horror of onlookers, he launched himself at the man, knocked him to the floor and shouted [...] "How dare you come here like this? Who do think you are <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> this way?" [...] before storming out of the room. However, as the shaken old man left the building, Frank Baker saw Ford's business manager Fred Totman meet him at the door, where he handed the man a cheque for $1,000 and instructed Ford's chauffeur to drive him home. There, an ambulance was waiting to take the man's wife to the hospital where a specialist, flown in from San Francisco at Ford's expense, performed the operation. Some time later, Ford purchased a house for the couple and pensioned them for life. When Baker related the story to Francis Ford, he declared it the key to his brother's personality: ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{was curious}} why a {{high-ranking}} official in President Bill Clinton's National Security Council (NSC) was given this assignment. Wilson {{had become a}} vocal opponent of President Bush's policies in Iraq after contributing to Al Gore {{in the last election}} cycle and John Kerry in this one. During a long conversation with a senior administration official, I asked why Wilson was assigned the mission to Niger. He said Wilson had been sent by the CIA's counter-proliferation section at the suggestion of one of its employees, his wife. It was an offhand revelation from this official, who is no partisan gunslinger. When I called another official for confirmation, he said: [...] "Oh, you know about it." [...] The published report that somebody in the White House failed to plant this story with six reporters and finally found me as a willing pawn is simply untrue. At the CIA, the official designated <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> denied that Wilson's wife had inspired his selection but said she was delegated to request his help. He asked me not to use her name, saying she probably never again will be given a foreign assignment but that exposure of her name might cause [...] "difficulties" [...] if she travels abroad. He never suggested to me that Wilson's wife or anybody else would be endangered. If he had, I would not have used her name. I used it in the sixth paragraph of my column because it looked like the missing explanation of an otherwise incredible choice by the CIA for its mission.|$|E
