40|$|The Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) is an {{independent}} statutory authority and is the key provider of independent environmental advice <b>to</b> Government. <b>The</b> <b>EPA’s</b> objectives are <b>to</b> protect <b>the</b> environment and <b>to</b> prevent, control and abate pollution. <b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> aims <b>to</b> achieve some of this {{through the development of}} Environmental Assessment Guidelines (EAGs) for the environmental impact assessment (EIA) of proposals or schemes.

25|$|E-waste is {{a growing}} problem, {{accounting}} for 20–50 million metric tons of global waste per year according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA.</b> It is also the fastest growing waste stream in the EU. Many recyclers do not recycle e-waste responsibly. After the cargo barge Khian Sea dumped 14,000 metric tons of toxic ash in Haiti, the Basel Convention was formed to stem the flow of hazardous substances into poorer countries. They created the e-Stewards certification to ensure that recyclers are held to the highest standards for environmental responsibility and to help consumers identify responsible recyclers. This works alongside other prominent legislation, such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive of the EU the United States National Computer Recycling Act, to prevent poisonous chemicals from entering waterways and the atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|In December 2010, several groups, {{including}} the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, {{filed suit against}} the EPA in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The plaintiffs argued the EPA {{does not have the}} authority to issue a “partial waiver” that covers some cars and not others. Among other arguments, the groups argued that the higher ethanol blend is not only a problem for cars, but also for fuel pumps and underground tanks not designed for the E15 mixture. It was also argued that the rise in ethanol has contributed to the big jump in corn prices in recent years. In August 2012, the federal appeals court rejected the suit against the EPA. The case was thrown out on a technical reason, as the court ruled the groups did not have legal standing to challenge EPA's decision to issue the waiver for E15. In June 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from industry groups opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> ruling about E15, and let the 2012 federal appeals court ruling stand.|$|E
25|$|In March 2009 Growth Energy, a {{lobbying}} {{group for the}} ethanol industry, formally requested the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to allow the ethanol content in gasoline to be increased to 15%, from 10%. In October 2010, the EPA granted a waiver to allow up to 15% blends to be sold for cars and trucks with a model year of 2007 or later, representing about 15% of vehicles on the roads. In January 2011 the waiver was expanded to authorize use of E15 to include model year 2001 through 2006 passenger vehicles. The EPA also decided not to grant any waiver for E15 use in any motorcycles, heavy-duty vehicles, or non-road engines because current testing data does not support such a waiver. According to the Renewable Fuels Association the E15 waivers now cover 62% of vehicles {{on the road in}} the country. In December 2010 several groups, including the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, filed suit against the EPA in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In August 2012 the federal appeals court rejected the suit against the EPA ruling that the groups did not have legal standing to challenge EPA's decision to issue the waiver for E15.

The New York Times, Vice Media's tech-news site Motherboard, public radio station WNYC, real estate news site 6sqft, and environmental advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) connected Trump's declared policies to the risk of returning to a more polluted environment, with each publication evoking the 1966 smog as an example of the potential dangers of defunding and deregulation. David Hawkins, an attorney for NRDC, recalled, [...] "I was a student at Columbia Law School during the 1966 episode.

500|$|A {{number of}} {{organizations}} have been formed to try to gain public interest in restoring the river. One {{of the most prominent}} is the Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority (SAWPA), formed by five municipal water districts in the Santa Ana River area. A second one is the Santa Ana River Dischargers Association. Both have conducted studies as to what beneficial uses the Santa Ana River would have aside from water supply and flood control, as well as the removal of some of the concreted sections of the lower river. This set of studies is known as the [...] "Use-Attainability Analysis", which was submitted to the state Congress, which approved it.
