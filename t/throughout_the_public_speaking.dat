40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to gather {{evidence}} about whether or not students would be interested in taking <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> course in <b>the</b> cross-cultural format, and whether or not NNS would be likely to fit well in such a class with NS. To determine student interest in cross-cultural programming and perceived needs in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> course, a survey was given to the students enrolled in speech communications 212 at Iowa State University during the spring semester of 2000. This study reports the findings and results of <b>the</b> <b>Public</b> Speaking and Cultural Perceptions Survey. Responses were collected from NS and NNS enrolled in the course and compared to determine similarities and differences between the two groups. Using this information, the study assessed the student attitudes toward cross-cultural programming and perceived needs in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> course and made suggestions on how to use cross-cultural programming in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> program at Iowa State.

The teachers of WLA believe that the students should learn the materials in unity. This study involved 102 of 3 rd to 5 th year grade students of Smart Ekselensia High School, Bogor, Indonesia. <b>The</b> <b>public</b> English <b>speaking</b> activity has been held for 6 months. <b>The</b> <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> can be in form of storytelling, general speech, and religious speech.

40|$|M. A. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the state of rhetorical criticism in <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> organisations in South Africa. <b>Public</b> <b>speaking</b> is defined as rhetoric and <b>the</b> evaluation of <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> as rhetorical criticism. The different perspectives towards rhetorical criticism are outlined and the approaches encompassed by these perspectives are discussed. The focus of the study is the state of rhetorical criticism in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> organisations in South Africa. It was therefore necessary to establish the orientations and purposes of these organisations. <b>The</b> <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> organisations identified at the outset of the study were Afrikaanse Taal-en Kultuurvereniging and Toastmasters International. The research project involved participant observation for the purpose of first-order interpretation ofthe methods ofevaluation used by these organisations. These organisations were founded for the purposes of promoting <b>the</b> skill of <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> and developing confidence in speakers. By applying purposive sampling initially, snowball sampling emerged and <b>the</b> other <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> organisations in South Africa were identified. This enabled the inclusion of the whole population for the purposes of this study. The investigation of the contemporary theories on rhetorical criticism revealed that there was a breakaway from the initial speaker orientation that focused on the effect of the speaker. Different perspectives on rhetorical criticism emerged since the traditional perspective that included approaches that focused on various forms of message analysis. Although effectiveness remained the overall criteria in the assessment ofpublic speaking, the emphasis has shifted to the message rather than the speaker. It is accepted that rhetorical criticism is subjective but at the same time it should be justified by reasons...|$|R

After implementing this teaching approach for one semester, the results showed an increase in cognitive learning but no improvement in the quality of student speeches or grading consistency.
