5|$|In 1981, Yamaha {{introduced}} a new square-four cylinder bike, similar to Suzuki's RG500. Roberts raced to a second-place finish behind Marco Luchinelli at the non-championship Imola 200 race. Roberts' bike had a suspension failure in the Grand Prix season opener at Austria, but he rebounded to win the next two races in Germany and Italy. Roberts' title hopes suffered a setback at the Dutch TT at Assen when his Yamaha's front brake pads were installed incorrectly causing his front wheel <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> on the starting line, ending his race before it had started. He came back to score a second place behind Lucchinelli in Belgium, but was once again struck by misfortune when {{a bad case of}} food poisoning forced him to miss the San Marino Grand Prix. He then narrowly lost the British Grand Prix to Jack Middelburg by three-tenths of a second before ending his season with a seventh place in Finland and a retirement in Sweden. Suzuki team riders Mamola and Lucchinelli battled to the final race of the season before the Italian claimed the championship with a total of five Grand Prix victories, with Mamola finishing in second and Roberts in third place.|$|E
5|$|In {{the debates}} {{leading up to}} World War I, a number of isolationist {{senators}} filibustered bills that Wilson considered important. The filibusters lasted for weeks and twice lasted for over three months. Wilson and the bills' supporters requested that Marshall put a gag-order in place to cut off debate, but he refused on ethical grounds, allowing a number of bills to be defeated in hopes that opposition would eventually end their filibuster. Among the defeated bills was one allowing merchant ships to arm themselves, and another allowing the US government to make direct arms sales to the allies. Despite their victories, {{the small group of}} senators continued <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> the senate to prevent any pro-war legislation from passing. In response, Marshall led the Senate to adopt a new rule on March 8, 1917, allowing filibusters to be broken by two-thirds of voting Senators. This replaced the previous rule that allowed any senator to prolong debate as long as he desired. The rule has been modified several times, most prominently that the current rule requires three-fifths of all Senators, not only the ones voting.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of Muguruza's early loss at the 2017 China Open, Halep was finally able <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> the WTA world no. 1 ranking {{for the first time}} by {{defeating}} Ostapenko in the semifinals of the same event. Despite losing her next match in the final to Caroline Garcia, Halep took the no. 1 ranking on 9 October. She became the seventh player to reach the no. 1 ranking without having won a Grand Slam tournament.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the early 1970s, the issue of race began to {{dominate}} all others and the regime started to repress its white opponents. By 1975, although officially democratic, the regime had started <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> even peaceful opponents of white domination. Black Rhodesians regarded their legal situation as morally unjustifiable and wanted full equality. From August 1964 to December 1974, Robert Mugabe was imprisoned without trial. Although legal, it was emblematic of a regime that disregarded human rights as part of its fight against terrorism.|$|E
25|$|The ABS {{controller}} {{knows that}} such a rapid deceleration is impossible, so it reduces the pressure to that brake until it sees an acceleration, then it increases the pressure until it sees the deceleration again. It can do this very quickly, before the tire can actually significantly change speed. The {{result is that the}} tire slows down {{at the same rate as}} the car, with the brakes keeping the tires very near the point at which they will start <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>up.</b> This gives the system maximum braking power.|$|E

25|$|Then Lt. Col Shuwa was Commander of the 5th Battalion in Kano {{during the}} Nigerian Army Mutiny of July 1966 where many Igbo {{military}} officers were systematically murdered by their northern counterparts {{for what the}} northern officers perceived as retribution for the January 15, 1966 coup (which was led by mostly Igbo officers). Shuwa's deputy at the 5th Battalion, then Major James Oluleye took the initiative by asking his company commanders <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> the battalion armory and hand over the armory keys in Olulye's armory safe. As a result of Shuwa and Oluleye's leadership, {{the lives of many}} Igbo officers during the July mutiny were saved.|$|E
500|$|Luxating patella {{is another}} health {{issue in the}} Pomeranian breed. It occurs when, through either {{malformation}} or trauma, the ridges forming the patellar groove in the knee are not prominent and are too shallow to allow the patella to properly sit securely. This can cause the patella to [...] "luxate" [...] (jump out of the groove) sideways which will cause the leg <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> with the foot off the ground. While the muscles are contracted the patella cannot return to the correct position. The initial pain {{is caused by the}} knee cap sliding across the ridges of the femur. Once out of position, the dog does not feel any pain caused by the slipped disc.|$|E

2500|$|... 5) One-channel, one-sensor ABS: This {{system is}} {{commonly}} found on pickup trucks, SUVs, and vans with rear-wheel ABS. It has one valve, which controls both rear wheels, and one speed sensor, {{located in the}} rear axle. This system operates {{the same as the}} rear end of a three-channel system. The rear wheels are monitored together and they both have to start <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> before the ABS kicks in. In this system {{it is also possible that}} one of the rear wheels will lock, reducing brake effectiveness. This system is also easy to identify, as there are no individual speed sensors for any of the wheels.|$|E
2500|$|In Dream Warriors, more of Freddy's backstory is {{revealed}} by the mysterious nun who repeatedly appears to Dr. Gordon. Freddy's mother, Amanda Krueger, was a nurse at the asylum featured in the film. At the time she worked there, a largely abandoned, run-down wing of the asylum was used <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> entire hordes of the most insane criminals all at once. When Amanda was young, she was accidentally locked {{into the room with}} the criminals over a holiday weekend. They managed to keep her hidden for days, raping her repeatedly. [...] When she was finally discovered, she was barely alive and was pregnant with the future Freddy Krueger.|$|E
2500|$|... 3) Three-channel, three-sensor ABS: This scheme, {{commonly}} found on pickup trucks with four-wheel ABS, has a speed sensor and a valve {{for each of}} the front wheels, with one valve and one sensor for both rear wheels. The speed sensor for the rear wheels is located in the rear axle. This system provides individual control of the front wheels, so they can both achieve maximum braking force. The rear wheels, however, are monitored together; they both have to start <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> before the ABS will activate on the rear. With this system, it is possible that one of the rear wheels will lock during a stop, reducing brake effectiveness. This system is easy to identify, as there are no individual speed sensors for the rear wheels.|$|E

2500|$|A and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [...] UKHL 17, the {{majority}} of the House of Lords decided that the detention without trial under the ATCSA 2001 was discriminatory to non-British nationals, and therefore incompatible under Art.14 ECHR. A declaration of incompatibility was issued under s.4 HRA 1998. Lord Hoffmann was the only dissenting judge to hold that the whole detention without trial idea was incompatible with the right to a trial under Art.6, and that the derogation was unacceptable, because there was no [...] "threat {{to the life of the}} nation". He argued strongly that it would be wrong to suggest, with {{the majority}}'s view that discrimination was the problem, that the government should be allowed <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> all Britons alike.|$|E
2500|$|After landing, Comstock {{reported}} {{what happened}} and the chief designer of the P-47 Thunderbolt, Alexander Kartveli, questioned Lt. Comstock at length and made numerous calculations. [...] Republic Aviation soon issued a press release claiming that Lts. Comstock and Dyar had exceeded the speed of sound. [...] This was {{picked up in the}} national media and also drawn in Ripley's Believe It or Not! [...] Soon after the press release, the 56th Fighter Group received a telegram from Gen. Henry “Hap” Arnold that “there would be no more discussion about the dive”. The actual speed attained was probably less than the speed of sound but this speed which caused the flight controls <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> was referred to as “compressibility”. This effect was encountered by many pilots flying in combat but training and proper procedures allowed them to recover from it.|$|E
2500|$|Watson proved unable <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> the George C. Wallace base in South Carolina. Former State Representative Alfred W.

Bethea claimed that Wallace was {{sympathetic}} to his candidacy, but Wallace was successfully seeking a third nonconsecutive term {{as governor of}} Alabama that year; he took no part in the South Carolina campaign. Frank B. Best, Sr., of Orangeburg, the 1968 Wallace campaign manager in South Carolina, endorsed Watson, having objected to West's early backing of Hubert H. Humphrey {{in the presidential race}} that year. West had called Humphrey [...] "a real friend of the South though he has had no credit for it." [...] Other Wallace leaders backed West, who led in ten of the twelve counties that Wallace had carried in 1968.|$|E

2500|$|The SMU Mustangs {{had won the}} 1935 {{national}} championship (as determined by the Dickinson System at the time), 10 Southwest Conference titles, and had attended 11 bowl games. They also had numerous All-Americans including a Heisman Trophy winner (Doak Walker in 1949). [...] From 1980 to 1984, SMU enjoyed its most successful era since the late 1940s and early 1950s. [...] They posted a record of 49–9–1 and won three Southwest Conference titles. [...] They nearly won their second national title in 1982, when they finished the season as the only undefeated team in the nation. [...] However, the team lost its shot at a title when it settled for a tie against Arkansas in the last {{game of the season}} in order <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> the conference title and a spot in the Cotton Bowl, rather than risk a two-point conversion that could have won the contest. [...] For most {{of the first half of}} the 1980s, the Mustangs played at Texas Stadium, then the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{following}} year, Bell became professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at the Boston University School of Oratory. During this period, he alternated between Boston and Brantford, spending summers in his Canadian home. At Boston University, Bell was [...] "swept up" [...] by the excitement engendered {{by the many}} scientists and inventors residing in the city. He continued his research in sound and endeavored {{to find a way}} to transmit musical notes and articulate speech, but although absorbed by his experiments, he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation. While days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes, Bell began to stay awake late into the night, running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house. Keeping [...] "night owl" [...] hours, he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> his notebooks and laboratory equipment. Bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking cover. Worse still, his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches. Returning to Boston in fall 1873, Bell made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{weeks earlier}} in Camelot, Emma brings {{a box with}} the Spark of the Promethean Flame in it to Granny's Diner, and she tells Henry that she can reunite the sword with it. Henry tells her that the others are not back with the Arthur's {{fragment}} of Excalibur, and Emma says that Merlin is missing too. Granny and Henry begin <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> the shop, but before they can finish, they are frozen with magic by Merlin, who is there and being forced to follow Arthur's orders, due to him being tethered to the Excalibur fragment. He says that Arthur tethered him to Excalibur and has ordered him to unite the sword, with the Promethean Flame. Emma refuses to hand it over, and Merlin says that Arthur has her family and will force him to kill them, unless she hands over the Dagger of the Dark One and the flame. Emma says that it’s not a flame yet, just a spark, since she hasn't {{had enough time to}} light it yet, but Merlin tells her that with her power, she will be able to light it when she's ready. Emma then says she can’t give up without a fight. But Merlin tells her that [...] "acceptance is a form of strength," [...] begs her not to seek vengeance and not to make the same mistakes as Nimue.|$|E
