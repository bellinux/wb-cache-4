40|$|AbstractSitting for the Examination for Admission to Higher Education (YGS) is {{the first}} phase of the {{university}} entrance examination process in Turkey. High school teachers have raised concerns regarding the inconsistency between <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> YGS mathematics tests and <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 11 th- and 12 th-grade mathematics curricula. Document analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2010 – 2012 YGS mathematics tests and <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> 11 th- and 12 th-grade mathematics textbooks revealed that <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> these tests is 89 % to 93 % inconsistent with <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 11 th-grade mathematics textbook and 98 % to 99 % inconsistent with <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 12 th-grade mathematics textbook...|$|R

5|$|The BASIC {{interpreter}} {{was developed}} from that {{used on the}} ZX81 and a ZX81 BASIC program can be typed into a Spectrum largely unmodified, but Spectrum BASIC included many extra features {{making it easier to}} use. The ZX Spectrum character set was expanded from that of the ZX81, which did not feature lower-case letters. Spectrum BASIC included extra keywords for the more advanced display and sound, and supported multi-statement lines. The cassette interface was much more advanced, saving and loading around five times faster than the ZX81 (1500 bits per second compared to 307), and unlike the ZX81, the Spectrum could maintain the TV display during tape storage and retrieval operations. As well as being able to save programs, the Spectrum could save <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> arrays, <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the screen memory, and <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> any defined range of memory addresses.|$|E

30|$|The {{processes}} of solution in, and exsolution from, formation water influence <b>the</b> component <b>content</b> <b>of</b> natural gas by contrasting <b>the</b> relative <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> components before <b>the</b> natural gas dissolves {{in water and}} those after exsolving from water under different conditions of high temperatures and pressures. Compared with the composition of original natural gas, <b>the</b> relative <b>content</b> <b>of</b> methane and nitrogen increased after the natural gas dissolved in water. <b>The</b> increase <b>of</b> nitrogen <b>content</b> exceeds that <b>of</b> methane, but <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> ethane, propane, pentane etc reduced. At the same temperature and with pressure increasing <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> methane increased and that of heavier hydrocarbons reduced. At the same pressure <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> methane increased quickly from 90 °C to 120 °C, and <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> heavier hydrocarbons reduced. But at even higher temperatures, the increase of methane slowed down and <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> heavier hydrocarbons increased slightly. At the same temperature and different pressures, heavier hydrocarbons reduced much more with increasing carbon atom number, while with temperature increasing <b>the</b> <b>content</b> difference <b>of</b> heavier hydrocarbons reduced. Therefore, {{the influence of the}} solution and exsolution should be considered {{in the study of the}} migration and accumulation mechanism of natural gas.|$|R

5|$|An unusual type of {{predator}} deterrence {{is observed}} in the Malaysian exploding ant. Social hymenoptera rely on altruism to protect the entire colony, so the self-destructive acts benefit all individuals in the colony. When a worker ant's leg is grasped, it suicidally expels <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> its hypertrophied submandibular glands, expelling corrosive irritant compounds and adhesives onto the predator.
