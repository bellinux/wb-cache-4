40|$|Abstract — Future MEMS {{systems will}} be {{composed}} of larger varieties of devices with very different functionality such as electronics, mechanics, optics and bio-chemstry. Integration technology of heterogeneous devices must be developed. This article first deals with the current development trend of new fabrication technologies; those include self-assembling of parts over a large area, wafer-scale encapsulation by wafer-bonding, nano imprinting, and roll-to-roll printing. In {{the latter half of}} the article, the concept towards the heterogeneous integration of devices and functionality into micro/nano systems is described. The key idea is to combine the conventional top-down technologies and the novel bottom-up technologies for building nano systems. A simple example is the carbon nano <b>tube</b> <b>interconnection</b> that is grown in the via-hole of a VLSI chip. In the laboratory level, the position-specific self-assembly of nano parts on a DNA template was demonstrated through hybridization of probe DNA segments attached to the parts. Also, bio molecular motors were incorporated in a micro fluidic system and utilized as a nano actuator for transporting objects in the channel.

40|$|AbstractExisting {{commercial}} {{parabolic trough}} power plants use thermal oil as a heat transfer fluid, with working {{temperatures in the}} region of 400 °C. In order to achieve more efficient generating systems, a second generation of parabolic troughs that operate at temperatures higher than 400 °C is being developed. One possibility, Abengoa Solar is assessing, it is the use of direct steam generation (DSG) inside parabolic troughs in order to achieve higher temperatures; the first stage heating up to 450 °C and the second stage heating up to 550 °C. There is, however, a certain degree of complexity in the use of DSG technology that has resulted in it not yet being utilized in commercial plant designs. Due to the presence of saturated steam inside the parallel loops the required control system is more complex, particularly during transitory periods of radiation. Also the higher operating pressures and temperatures in the solar field mean that the receiver <b>tubes</b> and <b>interconnections</b> between collectors are very critical components. For this reason, typical systems utilize an intermediate fluid for energy transfer. In order to overcome these challenges, Abengoa Solar has built a demonstration plant of 8 MWht. The plant is composed of an evaporator field with three parallel loops and a superheater field with two loops in order to work at 85 bar and 450 °C. The demonstration plant has been operated and evaluated for one year. During this test period, the following have been evaluated and validated:•An innovative control strategy system that guarantees the stability of the plant even under transient conditions. •Receiver tube design able to achieve 450 °C, analyzing the mechanical behavior, optical performance, and heat losses. •Different configurations of interconnections between collectors with ball joints and flexible rotation joints. A theoretical model has been developed for commercial scale DSG plants and validated with experimental data obtained from the demonstration plant...|$|R
40|$|Microfabrication {{technologies}} {{originating from}} {{the semiconductor industry}} were applied to the instrumentation of analytical chemistry. Heated nebulizer (HN) chips made of silicon and glass were developed. The HN chips are used to vaporize a sample prior to detection by a mass spectrometer. The chips {{can be used with}} both liquid and gaseous samples and they are compatible with multiple atmospheric pressure ionization techniques, which enables wide applicability with different separation methods and various types of analytes. Better sensitivity, flexibility and operation with a lower sample and nebulizer gas flow rates was achieved by the miniaturization of the heated nebulizer. The chips can operate with 50 nL min- 1 to 5 µL min- 1 sample flow rates typical of microfluidic separation systems. Silicon and glass microfabrication methods - etching, wafer bonding and thin film technology - were developed and applied to the fabrication of the HN chips in 40 different layout and process variations. The thermal behaviour of the chips and the shape of the gaseous jet produced by the chips was studied. A method was developed for measuring the temperature distribution of a gaseous jet using a miniature thermocouple attached to a computer controlled xyz stage. Different methods for making capillary <b>tube</b> and electrical <b>interconnections</b> to the chips were also studied. Liquid chromatography (LC) column chips were developed resulting in an integrated chip having both an LC column and a heated nebulizer on a single chip. At the end of the LC column there is a high aspect ratio micropillar frit which enables packing the column with particles. The novel chips developed in this work extend the available ionization methods and the range of suitable analytes compared to the previously presented chips for mass spectrometry...|$|R
