5|$|As a {{delegate}} to the U.N. General Assembly in 1968, Cooper strongly denounced the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. He also supported Montana Senator Mike Mansfield's proposal to bring {{the matter of the}} Vietnam War before the United Nations. Returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> 1969, he joined Alaska Senator Ernest Gruening and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse in protesting restrictions on orderly protests at the United States Capitol.|$|E

5|$|Biden {{was born}} in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 1942, and lived there for ten years before moving {{with his family to}} Delaware. He became an {{attorney}} in 1969, and was elected to the New Castle County council in 1970. He was first elected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> 1972, and became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in the Senate, Stanley {{returned}} to his legal practice. In the 1927 gubernatorial election, he threw his support to his old enemy, J. C. W. Beckham, hoping to improve his chances of returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> 1930. Beckham lost to Republican Flem D. Sampson, greatly diminishing Stanley's chances in the senatorial campaign.|$|E
5|$|Following the Prussian campaign, Napoleon {{appointed}} Klein {{as governor}} of the Imperial palace. In 1807, Klein was called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> <b>In</b> 1808, he was raised by letters of patent to a count of the empire and awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Bavarian Lion. In 1812, he was placed {{in command of the}} recruitment and training of a cohort of the National Guard.|$|E

5|$|Glenn {{resigned}} from NASA in January 1964. He planned {{to run for}} a U.S. Senate seat from Ohio, but an injury in February 1964 forced his withdrawal. He retired from the Marine Corps the following year. He lost a close primary election in 1970. A member of the Democratic Party, Glenn first won election <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> 1974 and served for 24 years until January 1999.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Dar {{returned}} to Pakistan after several monthsâ€™ of stay outside Pakistan. He {{ran for a}} seat of the Senate of Pakistan and was successfully elected {{for the first time}} for a term of three years. During his tenure as Member of the Senate, he served as Parliamentary Leader of PML-N in the Senate. He was re-elected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> the 2006 senate election, this time for six years.|$|E
5|$|As First Lady of the United States, Clinton was an {{advocate}} for gender equality and healthcare reform. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led to her issuing a statement reaffirming her commitment to the marriage. In 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female Senator from New York. She was re-elected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> 2006. Running for president in 2008, she won far more delegates than any previous female candidate, but lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama.|$|E

5|$|As a Senator, Gravel became {{nationally known}} for his {{forceful}} but unsuccessful attempts to end the draft during the War in Vietnam and for putting the Pentagon Papers into the public record in 1971 at some risk to himself. He conducted an unusual campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1972 for Vice President of the United States, and then {{played a crucial role}} in getting Congressional approval for the Trans-Alaska pipeline in 1973. He was re-elected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> 1974, but gradually alienated most of his Alaskan constituencies and his bid for a third term was defeated in a primary election in 1980.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840 presidential election, Crittenden again {{encouraged}} Kentucky Whigs {{to support}} the nomination of Henry Clay. After Clay lost the nomination, Crittenden supported eventual victor William Henry Harrison. Crittenden was re-elected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> 1840 {{even though he was}} widely expected to be named to a position in Harrison's presidential cabinet. He was apparently given his choice of cabinet positions, and chose that of Attorney General. He resigned his Senate seat to take this post.|$|E
5|$|Mathias {{was elected}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> 1968, {{unseating}} the incumbent Democrat, Daniel Brewster, who twenty years earlier {{had been his}} roommate while attending the University of Maryland School of Law. He continued his record as a liberal Republican in the Senate, and frequently clashed with the conservative wing of his party. For {{a few months in}} late 1975 and early 1976, Mathias considered running an insurgent presidential campaign in an attempt to stave off the increasing influence of conservative Republicans led by Ronald Reagan.|$|E

5|$|On January 19, 2010, Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown {{was elected}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> a special {{election}} to replace Kennedy, having campaigned on giving the Republican minority the 41st vote needed to sustain Republican filibusters. His victory had become significant because of its effects on the legislative process. The first was psychological: the symbolic importance of losing Kennedy's traditionally Democratic Massachusetts seat made many Congressional Democrats concerned about the political cost of passing a bill.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} factions were {{inflamed}} {{almost as soon}} as the 1924 legislature convened. A bill to outlaw parimutuel betting in the state passed the House of Representatives, but failed in the Senate. The next legislative battle centered on removing the head of the Board of Charities and Corrections and give the governor greater control over the board's makeup; this attempt also narrowly failed. When Senator Stanley, an opponent of prohibition, sought re-election <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> 1924, Fields and his allies did not support him, leading to the election of Republican Frederick M. Sackett and giving the Republicans both of the state's senate seats {{for the first time in}} history.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{freshman}} class of 1910 brought new hope to the reformers. Fourteen of the thirty newly elected senators {{had been elected}} through party primaries, which amounted to popular choice in their states. More {{than half of the}} states had some form of primary selection for the Senate. The Senate finally joined the House to submit the Seventeenth Amendment to the states for ratification, nearly ninety years after it first was presented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> 1826.|$|E

5|$|Tydings won {{election}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> 1964. However, {{his controversial}} stances {{on gun control}} and crime in the District of Columbia cost him re-election in 1970. He made another attempt at his old seat in 1976, but was defeated in the Democratic primary election by Paul Sarbanes. He later served {{as a member of}} the Board of Regents of the University of Maryland, College Park and the University System of Maryland, and continues to practice law.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Johnson {{returned}} to the House of Representatives. The legislature appointed him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> 1819 to fill the seat vacated by John J. Crittenden. As his prominence grew, his interracial relationship with Julia Chinn, an octoroon slave, was more widely criticized. It worked against his political ambitions. Unlike other upper class leaders who had African American mistresses but never mentioned them, Johnson openly treated Chinn as his common law wife. He acknowledged their two daughters as his children, giving them his surname, much {{to the consternation of}} some of his constituents. The relationship is believed to have led to the loss of his Senate seat in 1829, but his Congressional district returned him to the House the next year.|$|E
5|$|Beckham {{attempted}} to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> 1936. The {{head of the}} Jockey Club, James B. Brown, had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in 1930. In 1933 Beckham's ally, Robert Bingham, had been appointed ambassador to the Court of St. James's, increasing his prominence and influence. Beckham also enjoyed {{the support of the}} United Mine Workers and Louisville mayor Neville Miller. The race was complicated, though, by the entry of John Y. Brown, a Democrat who was a U.S. Representative and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives. He had agreed to support Chandler's bid for the governorship in exchange for Chandler's support in his run for the Senate. However, Chandler threw his support to Beckham, and while Brown was not able to win the seat without the support of Bingham and Chandler, he did garner 85,000 votes, most of them at Beckham's expense. Democratic incumbent M. M. Logan retained the seat by 2,385 votes.|$|E
