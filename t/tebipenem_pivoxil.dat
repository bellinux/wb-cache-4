50|$|Tebipenem (brand name: Orapenem) is a broad-spectrum orally-administered antibiotic, {{from the}} {{carbapenem}} subgroup of β-lactam antibiotics. It was {{developed as a}} replacement drug to combat bacteria that had acquired antibiotic resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Tebipenem is formulated as the ester <b>tebipenem</b> <b>pivoxil</b> due to the better absorption and improved bioavailability of this form. It has performed well in clinical trials for ear infection and looks likely to be further developed in future. It is only marketed in Japan. Tebipenem is the first carbapenem whose prodrug form, the pivalyl ester, is orally available.|$|E
40|$|Aims: To systemically {{investigate}} the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial properties of <b>tebipenem</b> <b>pivoxil</b> tablet. In addition, acute toxicity of this preparation was also studied. Methods: In vitro, {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) or minimal inhibitory concentration (MBC) were determined by using the serial 2 -fold broth or agar dilution methods. Further, cumulative MIC inhibition curves were then made to assess the antibacterial effects of the drug at various concentrations. In vivo, minimum lethal dose (MLD) in combination with maximum tolerance dose (MTD) {{was used to measure}} the acute toxicity of the <b>tebipenem</b> <b>pivoxil</b> tablet in mice. After that, sepsis mouse models challenged with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively, were established to evaluate the anti-infective effect of this preparation. Results: The MIC 90 values of <b>tebipenem</b> <b>pivoxil</b> against Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Pyogenic streptococcus, and Enterococcus faecalis were ≤ 0. 125, 16, 0. 5, 8, ≤ 0. 125, and 32 μg/mL, respectively. Correspondingly, the MIC 90 values of <b>tebipenem</b> <b>pivoxil</b> against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii were 1, 0. 5, ≤ 0. 125, 0. 25, 64, 64 μg/mL, respectively. The MBC values of <b>tebipenem</b> <b>pivoxil</b> against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae were 0. 016 – 2, 0. 063 – 32, 0. 031 – 32 μg/mL, respectively. The acute toxicity study showed that the MLD of the <b>tebipenem</b> <b>pivoxil</b> tablet was 4. 00 g/kg and the MTD was 3. 40 g/kg in mice. In all the sepsis mouse models, the simultaneous administration of the <b>tebipenem</b> <b>pivoxil</b> tablets significantly reduced mortality of the sepsis-model mice as compared with the control. Furthermore, the survival rate in the <b>tebipenem</b> <b>pivoxil</b> tablet group was remarkably higher than that in the meropenem group in all the sepsis mouse models tested. In the sepsis model challenged with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strain, respectively, <b>tebipenem</b> <b>pivoxil</b> tablet (100 mg/kg) displayed a better protective effect than <b>tebipenem</b> <b>pivoxil</b> granules (100 mg/kg). Conclusions: In summary, <b>tebipenem</b> <b>pivoxil</b> displays an excellent antibacterial activity against a variety of pathogenic bacteria in vitro. Importantly, <b>tebipenem</b> <b>pivoxil</b> tablet significantly protects the sepsis mice challenged with various pathogenic bacteria, which may provide a potential approach to treating bacterial sepsis in clinic...|$|E
40|$|Biapenem is a {{parenteral}} carbapenem antibiotic that exhibits wide-ranging antibacterial activity, remarkable chemical stability, {{and extensive}} stability against human renal dehydropeptidase-I. Tebipenem is the active form of <b>tebipenem</b> <b>pivoxil,</b> a novel oral carbapenem antibiotic {{that has a}} high level of bioavailability in humans, in addition to the above-mentioned features. β-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems, target penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are membrane-associated enzymes that play essential roles in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. To envisage the binding of carbapenems to PBPs, we determined the crystal structures of the trypsin-digested forms of both PBP 2 X and PBP 1 A from Streptococcus pneumoniae strain R 6, each complexed with biapenem or tebipenem. The structures of the complexes revealed that the carbapenem C- 2 side chains form hydrophobic interactions with Trp 374 and Thr 526 of PBP 2 X and with Trp 411 and Thr 543 of PBP 1 A. The Trp and Thr residues are conserved in PBP 2 B. These results suggest that interactions between the C- 2 side chains of carbapenems and the conserved Trp and Thr residues in PBPs play important roles in the binding of carbapenems to PBPs...|$|E
