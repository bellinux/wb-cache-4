Due to disputes between aircraft owners and insurance companies about whether the accident aircraft was taxiing or attempting to take-off, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> has been discontinued by many insurance companies.|$|E

Essentially, there are three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> available: loss <b>of</b> use, personal property, and personal liability.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} issues in sensor networks is related to analyzing the coverage, or how well a network of sensors monitors the physical space for an intrusion. The coverage {{is a measure of}} the quality of service (QoS) of the sensor network and has been the subject of various studies. The concept <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> was introduced by Gage in 1992, who studied it in relation to multi-robot systems. He defined three classes <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> problems: blanket coverage (also known as area coverage), where the goal is to achieve a static arrangement of sensing elements that maximizes the detection rate of targets appearing in the region, sweep coverage, where the goal is to move a number of sensors across the region as to maximize the probability of detecting a target, and barrier coverage, where the objective is to protect the region from unauthorized penetration. While blanket coverage is relatively well researched, the other two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> have been less studied and offer much greater technical challenges. In this survey we concentrate on the two dynamic <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> problems, barrier and sweep coverage. We review recent results, proof techniques, analyses, and open problems and challenges. We focus on methods that allow the performance of the algorithms, i. e. ...|$|R

50|$|There are {{the three}} types of {{insurance}} coverage. Replacement cost coverage pays the cost of repairing or replacing your property with like kind & quality regardless of depreciation or appreciation. Premiums for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> are based on replacement cost values, and not based on actual cash value. Actual cash value coverage provides for replacement cost minus depreciation. Extended replacement cost will pay over the coverage limit if the costs for construction have increased. This generally will not exceed 25% of the limit. When you obtain an insurance policy, the limit is the maximum amount of benefit the insurance company will pay for a given situation or occurrence. Limits also include the ages below or above what an insurance company will not issue a new policy or continue a policy.|$|E
500|$|Over 90% of D.C. {{residents}} {{have health insurance}} coverage, the second-highest rate in the nation.

5000|$|The 1961 {{amendment}} {{added another}} method of determining a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> called enterprise coverage. Enterprise coverage applies {{only when the}} business is involved in interstate commerce and its gross annual business volume is a minimum of $500,000. All employees working for [...] "enterprises" [...] are then covered by the FLSA if the individual firms of the [...] "enterprise have a revenue greater than $500,000 per year." [...] Under the original 1938 Act, a worker whose work is in the channels of interstate commerce is covered as an individual. [...] "Interstate commerce" [...] is interpreted so broadly that most work is included, such as ordering, loading, or using supplies from out of state, accepting payments from customers based on credit cards issued by out-of-state banks, and so on.|$|E
50|$|Each {{insurance}} company {{has its own}} set of underwriting guidelines to help the underwriter determine whether or not the company should accept the risk. The information used to evaluate the risk of an applicant for insurance will depend on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> involved. For example, in underwriting automobile coverage, an individual's driving record is critical. However, the type of automobile is actually far more critical. As part of the underwriting process for life or health insurance, medical underwriting may be used to examine the applicant's health status (other factors may be considered as well, such as age & occupation). The factors that insurers use to classify risks are generally objective, clearly related to the likely cost of providing coverage, practical to administer, consistent with applicable law, and designed to protect the long-term viability of the insurance program.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{coverage}} of the constitutional crisis often repeated that Zelaya wanted to call a constitutional convention because he sought either to continue in office as President, or sought a chance to seek re-election to President at some future point. Such reports echo the claims {{of three of the}} four daily newspapers in Honduras, which originated these claims. An example of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> is the German newspaper, Die Welt, which wrote [...] "Opponents of Zelaya believe he was pushing the limits of democracy with his drive to extend the single four-year term of presidents to allow re-election." [...] As noted above, Zelaya pointed out on at least one occasion (26 June) that since the electorate's decision whether to convoke a constituent assembly would not be made until 29 November 2009 [...] - [...] simultaneously with the presidential election [...] - [...] any constitutional changes that might eventually result would be too late to allow him to run for reelection.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{research}} on health insurance expansions has ignored the content <b>of</b> <b>coverage,</b> yet the nature <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> offered {{is likely to}} affect both take-up by the uninsured and the public policy relevant consequences of the expansion. This paper uses the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, the Survey of Program Dynamics, and the Rand Health Insurance Experiment to show that uninsured {{people are likely to}} value certain <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> more than others. Using a simulation model of the value <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> expansions, I show that front-end coverage with a low-benefit maximum is likely to be perceived as more valuable than catastrophic coverage by low-income uninsured people. Some high-deductible coverage may make uninsured people subjectively worse off. ...|$|R
