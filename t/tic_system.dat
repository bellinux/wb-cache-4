However, the use of tools for the statistical analysis of stochas- <b>tic</b> <b>systems</b> requires software engineers to carefully specify such systems in low level and specific languages.

We discuss how restricted e-Motions sys- tems are used to produce Maude corresponding specifications, using a model transformation from e-Motions to Maude, which comply with the restrictions of the VeStA tool, and which can therefore be used to per- form statistical analysis on the stochastic systems thus generated.

40|$|The {{characterisation}} of the behaviour of nonlinear aeroelastic {{systems has}} become a very important re- search topic. Nevertheless, {{most of the work}} carried out to date concerns the development of unsteady CFD solutions in the transonic region. Important though this work is, there is also a need for research which aims at understanding the behaviour of non- linear systems, particularly the occurance of Limit Cycle Oscillations (LCOs). The purpose of this pa- per is to study the stability of a simple aeroservoelas- <b>tic</b> <b>system</b> with nonlinearities in the control system. The work considers both structural and control law nonlinearities and assesses the stability of the system response by use of bifurcation diagrams. It is shown that simple feedback systems designed to increase the stability of the linearised system also stabilise the nonlinear system, although their effects can be less pronounced. Additionally, a nonlinear control law designed to limit the control surface pitch response was found to increase the flutter speed considerably by forcing the system to undergo limit cycle oscilla- tions instead of fluttering. Finally, friction was found to affect the damping of the system but not its sta- bility, as long as the amplitude of the frictional force is low enough not to cause stoppages in the motion.

40|$|This thesis deals {{primarily}} with the phenomenology associated to quan- tum aspects of spacetime. In particular, it aims at exploring the phenomeno- logical {{consequences of a}} fundamental discreteness of the spacetime fabric, as predicted by several quantum gravity models and strongly hinted by many theoretical insights. The {{first part of this}} work considers a toy-model of emergent spacetime in the context of analogue gravity. The way in which a relativistic Bose– Einstein condensate can mimic, under specific configurations, the dynamics of a scalar theory of gravity will be investigated. This constitutes proof-of- concept that a legitimate dynamical Lorentzian spacetime may emerge from non-gravitational (discrete) degrees of freedom. Remarkably, this model will emphasize the fact that in general, even when arising from a relativis- <b>tic</b> <b>system,</b> any emergent spacetime is prone to show deviations from exact Lorentz invariance. This will lead us to consider Lorentz Invariance Viola- tions as first candidate for a discrete spacetime phenomenology. Having reviewed the current constraints on Lorentz Violations and stud- ied in depth viable resolutions of their apparent naturalness problem, the second part of this thesis focusses on models based on Lorentz invariance. In the context of Casual Set theory, the coexistence of Lorentz invariance and discreteness leads to an inherently nonlocal scalar field theory over causal sets well approximating a continuum spacetime. The quantum as- pects of the theory in flat spacetime will be studied and the consequences of its non-locality will be spelled out. Noticeably, these studies will lend support to a possible dimensional reduction at small scales and, in a clas- sical setting, show that the scalar field is characterized by a universal non- minimal coupling when considered in curved spacetimes. Finally, the phenomenological possibilities for detecting this non-locality will be investigated. First, by considering the related spontaneous emission of particle detectors, then by developing a phenomenological model to test nonlocal effects using opto-mechanical, non-relativistic systems. In both cases, one could be able to cast in the near future stringent bounds on the non-locality scal...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{stochastic}} numerical model for {{what can be}} considered, at the present state-of-the-art, a prototype chemical oscillator, i. e. the Belousov- Zhabotinsky reaction. We mainly focus our attention on properly modifying an usual model based on systems of deterministic differential equations, commonly known as Oregonator. We aim to provide a mathematical description of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction by means of systems of stochastic differential equations of Ito type, together with the corresponding numerical discretization. Together with standard numerical schemes that approximate the whole stochas- <b>tic</b> <b>system,</b> such as the Euler-Maruyama method and its improvements, we also aim to separately treat the deterministic term and the stochastic one, by cou- pling the so-called exponential fitting technique [2] and Montecarlo simulations. This coupling looks particularly suitable to provide numerical approximations of oscillatory problems, since classical methods could require a very small step- size to accurately reproduce oscillatory behaviours. We rather propose a method that is constructed {{in order to be}} exact on functions other than polynomials for the approximation of the deterministic part. The coecients of the resulting adapted method are no longer constant as in the classical case, but rely on a parameter linked to oscillatory character, whose value is clearly unknown. The proposed estimation strategy is based on exploiting the informations belonging to known time series of experimental data which are available in the literature [1, 3]. Numerical experiments will be provided to show the effectiveness of the presented approach. References 1.

40|$|TravInfo is a Field Operational Test of {{advanced}} traveler information {{systems for the}} San Francisco Bay Area, sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The project involves a public/private partnership which seeks to compile, integrate and broadly disseminate timely and accurate multi-modal traveler information through commercial products and services. The public sector component centers on the Traveler Information Center (TIC), which collects and integrates both static and dynamic traveler information. The TIC began operations in September 1996 and will operate as an FOT through September of 1998. Private sector participation includes Information Service Providers (ISPs), who refine the information and disseminate it to end users. This report documents {{the evaluation of the}} TIC performed from September 1, 1996 (date at which TravInfo went on-line) through June 30, 1997 with respect to the system reliability, communications interface and operator interface elements of the evaluation of the <b>TIC.</b> <b>System</b> reliability examines system failures, including their initial symptoms, causes and duration. The communications interface examines TIC data access {{on the part of both}} the public and private sectors. Operator interface investigates the human element by considering the role of the operator in the flow of information through the TIC, the operators' tasks and responsibilities and the operators' physical working environment. With respect to system reliability, during the period of investigation (January-June 1997), a total of seventy-three problems originated within the TIC, eighty-nine percent of which originated within the primary TIC program, TransView. The publicly available traveler information phone service, Traveler Advisory Telephone System (TATS), recorded a fairly constant monthly call volume of between 50, 000 and 60, 000 calls during the reporting period of September 1996 through June 1997. AC Transit alone contributed approximately 55 % of the overall call volume throughout the reporting period. On average, for Oakland, the busiest regional system, approximately 3 % of the TATS system capacity was utilized. Private sector access of data, via the Landline Data System, has also been quite limited. From November 1996 to June 1997, only three ISPs downloaded data on a continuous basis, one of which downloaded 95 % of all data during this reporting period. The operator's role in the flow of information through the TIC has been crucial both in terms of data entry and data interpretation and prioritization. The two most time-consuming data sources are the California Highway Patrol's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system and Metro Network's airborne reports that respectively utilize approximately 57 % and 26 % of all operator time.

40|$|AbstractChloroplasts must import {{thousands}} of nuclear-encoded preproteins synthesized in the cytosol through two successive protein translocons at the outer and inner envelope membranes, termed TOC and TIC, respectively, {{to fulfill their}} complex physiological roles. The molecular identity of the TIC translocon had long remained controversial; two proteins, namely Tic 20 and Tic 110, had been proposed to be central to protein translocation across the inner envelope membrane. Tic 40 also had long been considered to be another central player in this process. However, recently, a novel 1 -megadalton complex consisting of Tic 20, Tic 56, Tic 100, and Tic 214 was identified at the chloroplast inner membrane of Arabidopsis and was demonstrated to constitute a general TIC translocon which functions {{in concert with the}} well-characterized TOC translocon. On the other hand, direct interaction between this novel <b>TIC</b> transport <b>system</b> and <b>Tic</b> 110 or Tic 40 was hardly observed.

40|$|International audienceThe {{conversion}} of anodic TiO 2 films into TiOxCy in ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) has been traced by photoemission spectroscopy {{in order to}} optimize the process parameters and study the different phase stabilities. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed in order to elucidate the main questions about TiOxCy composition and stability. The experimental data indicate that the anodic TiO 2 film is stable both in UHV and ethylene background up to ca. 600 K, and at this temperature, it starts to reduce leading to suboxide TiOx species. Above ca. 750 K, the formation of TiOxCy starts, since the oxygen vacancies begin {{to be replaced by}} carbon atoms. A surface enrichment in TiO 2 and elemental carbon has been detected on the converted TiOxCy film at room temperature. Real-time measurements have shown that this phenomenon takes place during the cool down process and DFT calculations suggest a possible explanation: as the temperature decreases below ca. 750 K (temperature at which the formation of TiOxCy starts), the TiOxCy phase is not thermodynamically stable, and it decomposes into TiO 2 and elemental carbon. The comparison of the experimental valence band data with DFT results has also allowed to establish that the film surface is not homogeneous and that segregation of TiO and <b>TiC</b> <b>systems</b> may take place. On the other hand, the local compositional study carried out by scanning photoelectron microscopy has shown that the {{conversion of}} the film is not homogeneous but depends on the grain orientation, in particular crystallites with an orientation close to 0 > and 0 > planes show a higher grade of conversion.

Tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) is a rather celebrated unit and much eort has been spent in the literature because of its importance as a structural component in many biologi-cally active natural products. 1 In addition, various deriva-tives of THIQ show promising biological activity. While designing conformationally restricted peptides, 1, 2, 3, 4 -tet-rahydroisoquinoline- 3 -carboxylic acid (Tic) has been uti-lized as a restricted analogue of phenylalanine. Tic moiety was also used as a synthon for the preparation of biologically active peptides and enzyme inhibitors. 2 Incorporation of Tic in d opioid receptors enhances d receptor binding anity and selectivity. 3 The traditional methods 4 such as Bischler-Napieralski, Picter-Spengler among others 5 for Tic preparation can deliver a limited degree of functionality in the aryl ring and the substitution pattern is set prior to the cycliza-tion step. A method that would generate the <b>Tic</b> ring <b>system</b> via a cycloaddition approach would provide a unique opportunity for the introduction of various sub-stituents by judicious choice of the reacting partners. The currently available approaches to THIQ unit cannot easily be extended to the synthesis of Tic derivatives. 6 In essence, preparation of Tic derivatives impose more constraints {{in the design of}} synthetic strategy. In this communication we report a general method involving a [2 + 2 + 2]-cycloaddition reaction as a key step for the construction of various Tic derivatives (eq 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{problems}} arising in applications {{result in}} the need to probe a probability distribution for functions. Examples include Bayesian nonparametric statistics and conditioned diffusion processes. Standard MCMC algorithms typically become arbitrarily slow under the mesh refinement dictated by nonparametric description of the un- known function. We describe an approach to modifying {{a whole range of}} MCMC methods, applicable whenever the target measure has density with respect to a Gaussian process or Gaussian random field reference measure, which ensures that their speed of convergence is robust under mesh refinement. Gaussian processes or random fields are fields whose marginal distri- butions, when evaluated at any finite set of N points, are RN-valued Gaussians. The algorithmic approach that we describe is applicable not only when the desired probability measure has density with respect to a Gaussian process or Gaussian random field reference measure, but also to some useful non-Gaussian reference measures constructed through random truncation. In the applications of interest the data is often sparse and the prior specification {{is an essential part of}} the over- all modelling strategy. These Gaussian-based reference measures are a very flexible modelling tool, finding wide-ranging application. Examples are shown in density estimation, data assimilation in fluid mechanics, subsurface geophysics and image registration. The key design principle is to formulate the MCMC method so that it is, in principle, applicable for functions; this may be achieved by use of proposals based on carefully chosen time-discretizations of stochas- <b>tic</b> dynamical <b>systems</b> which exactly preserve the Gaussian reference measure. Taking this approach leads to many new algorithms which can be implemented via minor modification of existing algorithms, yet which show enormous speed-up on a wide range of applied problems...|$|R
40|$|Based on the SHS {{reaction}} of Ti-B 4 C-sucrose <b>system,</b> <b>Ti(C,</b> N) -TiB 2 ceramic preforms were prepared by self-reactive spray forming technology. The characters of combustion and SHS reaction during the spray process were investigated by water-quenching experiments and collision experiments. The {{results show that}} during the spray process, the sprayed particles transform into ceramic beads after the process of heating, surface melting and reacting. The reaction begins with the melting of titanium. And the nitridation and oxidation of titanium go with the whole spray process. Each sprayed particle acts as an individual reactive unit, {{and there is no}} macro combustion wave and surface moving in the system. Each particle reacts and transforms in the different time by its own flight track. The transforming extent of the sprayed particles depends on their temperature and size. The sprayed particles with optimal size and high temperature can all transform into ceramic beads. The relative density, micro-hardness and fracture toughness of the sprayed preforms are ª© 97. 7 %,ªªHV 0. 2 2029 and 6. 0 MPa¡¤m 1 / 2 respectively. ª...|$|R
