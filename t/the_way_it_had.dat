25|$|Space, as {{an element}} of architecture, was {{utilised}} differently from <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been in the Middle Ages.

25|$|In 1980, the USFS {{realized}} how much its renovations had damaged an architecturally significant structure and began trying to undo {{some of the changes}} it had made. It developed a plan to restore the house and estate to a condition similar to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been in Pinchot's era, in consultation with the Park Service's Harper's Ferry Center, and hired staff with expertise in landscape and architecture. After a brief closing for this renovation, it reopened on August 11, 2001, Gifford Pinchot's birthday. The state of Pennsylvania's Department of Natural Resources also made a $2 million grant available for renovations to the entrance, entry road and parking facilities. In 2007 the USFS restored the swimming pool.|$|E

Hot Chip used a variety of vocal structures, including layered vocals, where two takes of the same vocals were added together, changed by idiosyncrasies from <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been sung, and the doubling of a single performance, shifted out of beat.|$|E
500|$|This missal {{had been}} {{owned by the}} Legh family since at least 1508.

[...] When the family moved from the house in 1946, the missal went with them, and was held for safe-keeping in the John Rylands Library in Manchester. [...] In the late 2000s the National Trust acquired it, and {{it was decided to}} return it to Lyme Park. [...] To celebrate this the décor of the library was restored to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been during the 19thcentury. [...] This included re-graining of its ceiling, reproducing velvet for the upholstery and curtains, and re-papering the room with replica wallpaper, based on its original design.|$|E

500|$|When {{the health}} care plan, now called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed Congress and became law in March 2010, McCain {{strongly}} opposed the landmark legislation not only on its merits but also on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been handled in Congress. As a consequence, he warned that congressional Republicans would not be working with Democrats on anything else: [...] "There will be no cooperation {{for the rest of}} the year. They have poisoned the well in what they've done and how they've done it." [...] McCain became a vocal defender of Arizona SB 1070, the April 2010 tough anti-illegal immigration state law that aroused national controversy, saying that the state had been forced to take action given the federal government's inability to control the border. In the August 24 primary, McCain beat Hayworth by a 56 to 32percent margin. McCain proceeded to easily defeat Democratic city councilman Rodney Glassman in the general election.|$|E
500|$|Inclement weather {{continued}} {{to disrupt the}} Saturday's proceedings as qualifying was delayed multiple times before being ultimately rescheduled for Sunday morning. Many drivers backed the decision, with Jenson Button saying: [...] "It {{was the right thing}} to do [...] In one respect, maybe if we decided three hours earlier it would have been better for the fans. But we wanted to get out there and drive and put on a show. Delaying it every half an hour was <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to be." [...] During the waiting period on Saturday, many teams had engaged in tomfoolery in the paddock to entertain the crowds, such as bowling or ballroom dancing between Red Bull teammates Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat. Ferrari later condemned the behaviour of their fellow teams, with team principal Maurizio Arrivabene saying: [...] "We are a Formula One team, not the Cirque du Soleil."

So in My Darling Clementine, we did it exactly <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been." [...] When Ford was working on his last silent feature Hangman's House in 1928, which {{included}} the first credited screen appearances by John Wayne, Earp used to visit the set. John Wayne later told Hugh O'Brian that he based his Western lawman walk, talk and persona to his acquaintance with Wyatt Earp, who was good friends with Mix. [...] "I knew him... I often thought of Wyatt Earp when I played a film character. There's a guy that actually did what I'm trying to do." [...] Wyatt Earp's character has been the central figure in 10 films and featured in many more. Among the best-known actors who have portrayed him are Randolph Scott, Guy Madison, Henry Fonda, Joel McCrea, Burt Lancaster, James Garner, Jimmy Stewart, Hugh O'Brian, Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner.|$|E

500|$|The {{second season}} {{begins with the}} {{introduction}} of two new cases: a bus accident that kills several of Veronica's classmates, and the death of PCH biker gang member Felix Toombs. A school bus carrying six Neptune High students and a teacher plunges off a cliff, killing all but one passenger. Veronica, {{who was supposed to be}} on the bus, makes it her mission to discover why the bus crashed and who is responsible. Logan picks a fight with Weevil and the PCHers and ends up accused of killing Felix (a charge he denies). Partway through the season, Weevil becomes convinced of Logan's innocence and they team up to find the real killer. This season shows Veronica's life returning to much <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been before Lilly's death: having broken up with Logan during the summer, she reunites with Duncan and is somewhat accepted by the '09ers. However, her private-eye sideline and tough persona keep her from being truly assimilated back into the rich crowd. '09ers Dick Casablancas and Cassidy [...] "Beaver" [...] Casablancas deal with a gold-digging stepmother, Kendall Casablancas, with whom they are left when their father flees the country while under investigation for real estate fraud. Wallace discovers that his biological father is alive, and takes a romantic interest in Jackie Cook, the daughter of baseball legend Terrence Cook who is investigated for the bus accident. Veronica discovers that the town mayor, who years ago coached a little league baseball team, sexually molested several team members, including Cassidy [...] "Beaver" [...] Casablancas. In the finale, it is discovered that Beaver is responsible for the bus accident and Veronica's rape, as well as a plane crash that kills the mayor (Veronica's dad was supposed to be on the plane, so she thinks he is dead). Veronica confronts Beaver on the roof of the Neptune Grand hotel, where he tries to kill her. Logan saves her, but Beaver commits suicide by jumping off the roof.|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt {{commented on}} {{his role in}} the battles: [...] "On the day of the big fight I had to ask my men to do a deed that European {{military}} writers consider utterly impossible of performance, that is, to attack over open ground an unshaken infantry armed with the best modern repeating rifles behind a formidable system of entrenchments. The only way to get them to do it in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to be done was to lead them myself." ...|$|E

Residents from several villages stated they first had to sit through a half-hour prayer meeting before receiving assistance.

[...] "What do they know of fishing" [...] he wrote [...] "who know only one fish and one way to fish for him?" [...] Yet his language was seldom so polemic and never adversarial.

2500|$|The Cromwell {{libretto}} {{arrived from}} Piave in pieces, and Verdi {{put it away}} until he had the complete version to work from. [...] However, when the composer and La Fenice's president met in Venice in late August, Verdi expressed some dissatisfaction at how the libretto had turned out. Then Mocenigo's casual reference to Hugo's successful 1830 drama Hernani as {{an idea for a}} libretto caught Verdi's imagination, as seen in a letter which the latter wrote to Mocenigo in early September which expressed concerns about Allan Cameron and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> turned out, though noting that this was [...] "the fault of the subject and not the poet".

2500|$|Blackmun {{turned to}} the [...] "colorable argument" [...] first made by Stewart in Scherk, calling it [...] "a ghost {{reluctant}} to accept its eternal rest" [...] that had received no development since then. It was really a device to introduce the argument that Wilko turned primarily on the acceptance of arbitration, a reading he described as [...] "overly narrow", feeling it contradicted what he had written in Mitsubishi Motors. Wilko had found expressly that the 1933 Act created {{an exception to the}} FAA, which the majority did not deal with. And thus, it did not follow that if the court was more confident about arbitration and Wilko had been decided <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been solely because of this lack of confidence, then Wilko was no longer valid.|$|E
