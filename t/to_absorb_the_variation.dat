This has caused an inefficient energy production and a huge variation in the energy prices. In the near future (10 to 15 years) the amount of non-controllable energy sources will double or more. This again will result in a number of problems: Inefficient energy production, problems with controlling the power grid, the wind turbines have to stop when the wind is optima and so on. The way to overcome these problem is to make the power consumer more flexible, or in other word the consumer have to use the energy when it is available. The main electrical energy consumer in a modern society is buildings and private homes. The amount of electrical energy used in this sector is about 70 % of the total electricity consumption. Because of that buildings and private homes has to play an active role in controlling the power grid, and by that mean secure a more efficient and green energy production. If houses and private housholds has {{to be a part of}} the solution then it is very important to finde a solusion that minimize the impact on the living comfort. The way to due that is to make an automatic and inteligente house control system that maximize the consumption flexibility based on the energy users behavior with out affection the living comfort. This behavior is of course different from household to household, because of that it is nessasary include an adaptive behavior prediction system. This paper describes a method to make houses flexible based om preknowlages of the user behavior. And calculate the energy flexibility base on simulation for 200000 typical houses in Denmark. The simulations shows that it is possible, based on 200000 houses, to store enough energy <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> in the production over a time horisont on several hours. 1...|$|E

50|$|Although the {{diesel-electric}} powertrain is {{the preferred}} choice for icebreakers due to the good low speed torque characteristics of the electric propulsion motors, icebreakers have also been built with diesel engines mechanically coupled to reduction gearboxes and controllable pitch propellers. The mechanical powertrain has several advantages over diesel-electric propulsion systems, such as lower weight and better fuel efficiency. However, diesel engines are sensitive to sudden changes in propeller revolutions, and to counter this mechanical powertrains are usually fitted with large flywheels or hydrodynamic couplings <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> torque <b>variations</b> resulting from propeller-ice interaction.|$|R

40|$|As third {{generation}} (3 G) wireless networks with {{high data rate}} get widely deployed, optimizing TCP performance over these networks would have a broad and significant impact on data application performance. One {{of the biggest challenges}} in optimizing TCP performance over the 3 G wireless networks is adapting to the significant delay and rate <b>variations</b> over <b>the</b> wireless channel. In this paper, we make two main contributions. First, we present a Window Regulator algorithm that uses the receiver window field in the acknowledgment packets to convey the instantaneous wireless channel conditions to the TCP source and an ack buffer <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> channel <b>variations,</b> thereby maximizing long-lived TCP performance. It improves the performance of TCP Sack by up to 100 % over a simple drop-tail algorithm for small buffer sizes at the congested router.

The proposed dynamometer system includes an energy storage mechanism <b>to</b> adaptively <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> energy <b>variations</b> following <b>the</b> dynamometer transients.

The overall dynamometer system is a dynamic complex system and design of the system is a multi-objective problem, which requires advanced optimisation techniques such as genetic algorithms. The case study of designing and simulation of the dynamometer system indicates that the genetic algorithm based approach is able to locate a best available solution in view of system performance and computational costs...|$|R
40|$|Gastric {{cancer is}} a {{completely}} curable cancer when it can be detected at its early stage. Thus, because early detection of gastric cancer is important, cancer screening by gastroscopy is performed. Recently, the hyperspectral camera (HSC), which can observe gastric cancer {{at a variety of}} wavelengths, has received attention as a gastroscope. HSC permits the discerning of <b>the</b> slight color <b>variations</b> of gastric cancer, and we considered its applicability to a gastric cancer diagnostic support system. In this paper, after correcting reflectance <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> individual <b>variations</b> in <b>the</b> reflectance of the HSC, a gastric cancer diagnostic support system was designed using the corrected reflectance. In system design, the problems of selecting the optimum wavelength and optimizing the cutoff value of a classifier are solved as a pattern recognition problem by the use of training samples alone. Using the hold-out method with 104 cases of gastric cancer as samples, design and evaluation of the system were independently repeated 30 times. After analyzing the performance in 30 trials, the mean sensitivity was 72. 2 % and the mean specificity was 98. 8 %. The results showed that the proposed system was effective in supporting gastric cancer screening...|$|R
