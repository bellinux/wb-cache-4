These may include carpets, upholstered furniture, or textiles. These routes of entry may be of particular importance in regard to children because contact can occur indirectly by hand-to-mouth transfer or directly if an infant sucks on the product. Another route that must be considered is inhalation of PFCs in indoor or outdoor air [10, 45, 46] {{as well as the}} inhalation of waterproofing sprays. Dermal exposure may also occur by skin contact with PFC-treated products [17].|$|E
40|$|The human {{prefrontal cortex}} (PFC) {{has been shown}} to be {{important}} for metacognition, the capacity to monitor and control one's own cognitive processes. Here we dissected the neural architecture of somatosensory metacognition using navigated single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to modulate tactile working memory (WM) processing. We asked subjects to perform tactile WM tasks and to give a confidence rating for their performance after each trial. We circumvented the challenge of interindividual variability in functional brain anatomy by applying TMS to two PFC areas that, according to tractography, were neurally connected with the primary somatosensory cortex (S 1) : one area in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG), another in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG). These two PFC locations and a control cortical area were stimulated during both spatial and temporal tactile WM tasks. We found that tractography-guided TMS of the SFG area selectively enhanced metacognitive accuracy of tactile temporal, but not spatial WM. Stimulation of the MFG area that was also neurally connected with the S 1 had no such effect on metacognitive accuracy of either the temporal or spatial tactile WM. Our findings provide causal evidence <b>that</b> the <b>PFC</b> <b>contains</b> distinct neuroanatomical substrates for introspective accuracy of tactile WM...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} vability of canine hearts after {{prolonged}} ex-vivo heart perservation, we evaluated the myocardial metabolism by determining the high energy phosphate(HEP) levels and respiratory function of isolated mitochondria(MRF). Furthermore, we calculated the mitochondrial score(MS) for semi-quantitative analysis of ultrastructural changes. These three indicators {{were compared with}} the left ventricular function(LVF) following orthotopic heart transplantation(H-TX). Forty two hearts, harvested from mongrel dogs, each weighing 8. 5 kg～ 15 kg, were divided into 3 groups : 24 -hour immersion in modified Collins solusion(MC) (group A), 24 -hour perfusion with MC(group B) and 24 -hour perfusion with MC containing perfluorochemicals(PFC) (group C). After the 24 -hour preservation, biopsies were obtained from 7 hearts in each group and HEP levels, MRF and MS were determined. The HEP levels, MRF and MS were significantly higher in group C than in group B and significantly higher in group B than group A. The cardiac function after H-TX revealed a similar tendency. These findings indicate that continuous hypothermic perfusion provides better protection than simple hypothermic immersion and that perfusion with an intracellular solution <b>containing</b> <b>PFC</b> preserves and protects an organ sufficiently before clinical heart transplantation...|$|R

40|$|Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) {{are used}} in {{biomaterial}} formulations to increase oxygen (O 2) tension and create a homogeneous O 2 environment in three-dimensional tissue constructs. It is unclear how PFCs affect mechanical and transport properties of the scaffold, which are critical for robustness, intracellular signaling, protein transport, and overall device efficacy. In this study, we investigate composite alginate hydrogels containing a perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB) emulsion stabilized with Pluronic (R) F 68 (F 68). We demonstrate that PFC addition significantly affects biomaterial properties and performance. Solution and hydrogel mechanical properties and transport of representative hydrophilic (riboflavin), hydrophobic (methyl and ethyl paraben), and protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA) solutes were compared in alginate/F 68 composite hydrogels with or without PFOB. Our results indicate that mechanical properties of the alginate/F 68 /PFOB hydrogels are not significantly affected under small strains, but a significant decrease fracture stress is observed. The effective diffusivity Deff of hydrophobic small molecules decreases with PFOB emulsion addition, yet the Deff of hydrophilic small molecules remained unaffected. For BSA, the Deff increased and the loading capacity decreased with PFOB emulsion addition. Thus, a trade-off between the desired increased O 2 supply provided by PFCs and the mechanical weakening and change in transport of cellular signals must be carefully considered {{in the design of}} biomaterials <b>containing</b> <b>PFCs.</b> (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
