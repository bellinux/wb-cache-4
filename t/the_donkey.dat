5|$|Archaeological, biogeographical, and {{linguistic}} evidence suggest that <b>the</b> <b>donkey</b> was first domesticated by nomadic pastoral people in North Africa over 5,000 years ago. The animals {{were used to}} help cope with the increased aridity of the Sahara and the Horn of Africa. Genetic evidence finds that <b>the</b> <b>donkey</b> was domesticated twice based on two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. It also points to a single ancestor, the Nubian wild ass. Attempts to domesticate zebras were largely unsuccessful, though Walter Rothschild trained some to draw a carriage in England.|$|E

There are over 5 million donkeys living in Australia, which means that <b>the</b> <b>donkeys</b> eat a significant amount of vegetation. <b>The</b> <b>donkeys</b> can readily find food in winter if it is wet; however food is much less plentiful in times of drought.|$|R

5|$|R.C. Pro-Am was {{developed}} by UK-based company Rare. In 1987, the game was originally titled Pro-Am Racing but was later renamed. It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) by Nintendo in February 1988 in North America, and in Europe on April 15 of the next year. It would later be ported to the Sega Genesis under the name Championship Pro-Am and was released by Tradewest in 1992.

5|$|Rare, who had {{previously}} developed <b>the</b> <b>Donkey</b> Kong Country games, began development on the 3D Donkey Kong in 1997. A 16-person team, with many members recruited from Rare's Banjo group, finished the game in 1999, when it was published by Nintendo for North America in November and worldwide by December. It was the first game to require the Nintendo 64 console's Expansion Pak, an accessory that added memory resources. The game had an exceptionally large marketing budget that included advertisements, sweepstakes, and a national tour.|$|E

5|$|The {{circuit board}} of Radar Scope was {{restructured}} for Donkey Kong. The Radar Scope hardware, originally {{inspired by the}} Namco Galaxian hardware, was designed for {{a large number of}} enemies moving around at high speeds, which Donkey Kong did not require, so the development team removed unnecessary functions and reduced the scale of the circuit board. While the gameplay and graphics were reworked for updated ROM chips, the existing CPU, sound hardware and monitor were left intact. The character set, scoreboard, upper HUD display and font are almost identical to Radar Scope, with palette differences. <b>The</b> <b>Donkey</b> Kong hardware had the memory capacity for displaying 128 foreground sprites at 16x16 pixels each and 256 background tiles at 8x8 pixels each. Mario and all moving objects used single sprites, the taller Pauline used two sprites, and the larger Donkey Kong used six sprites.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the second}} half of September, while the Anzac Mounted Division was at Abasan el Kebir, 600 donkeys were {{attached}} to <b>the</b> division. <b>The</b> <b>donkeys</b> arrived at <b>the</b> railway station, and after the [...] "bored-looking quadrupeds with their comical expressions and long floppy ears" [...] were unloaded, they were tied together in fives for the journey.

[...] Instead of moving along <b>the</b> road, <b>the</b> <b>donkeys</b> toured <b>the</b> countryside to eventually arrive at divisional headquarters, where they were assigned to a number of units. Seven donkeys were attached to each squadron to be ridden or led by 'spare parts.' A form of polo was played by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade riding donkeys, and swinging walking sticks at a football.

The breeding of large, white riding asses made Damascus famous, while Syrian breeders developed at least three other breeds, including one preferred by women for its easy gait. The Muscat or Yemen ass was developed in Arabia. By the second millennium BC, <b>the</b> <b>donkey</b> was brought to Europe, possibly {{at the same time as}} viticulture was introduced, as <b>the</b> <b>donkey</b> is associated with the Syrian god of wine, Dionysus. Greeks spread both of these to many of their colonies, including those in what are now Italy, France and Spain; Romans dispersed them throughout their empire.|$|E
