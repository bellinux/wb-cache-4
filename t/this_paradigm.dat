Some writers in ancient Greece (including, most notably, Aristotle) considered slavery natural and even necessary. <b>This</b> <b>paradigm</b> was notably questioned in Socratic dialogues; the Stoics produced the first recorded condemnation of slavery.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, design {{management}} {{was seen as}} limited to the management of design projects, but over time, it evolved to include other aspects of an organization at the functional and strategic level. A more recent debate concerns the integration of design thinking into strategic management as a cross-disciplinary and human-centered approach to management. <b>This</b> <b>paradigm</b> also focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an abductive mode of inference, compared to practices associated with the more traditional management paradigm.|$|E
5|$|Business design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of integrating design thinking into management. In organisation and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture / Design / Anthropology (A/D/A) paradigm which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. <b>This</b> <b>paradigm</b> focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an adductive mode of thinking, compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics / Economics / Psychology (M/E/P) management paradigm. Since 2006, the term Business Design is trademarked by the Rotman School of Management; they define business design as the application of design thinking principles to business practice. The designerly way of problem solving is an integrative way of thinking that {{is characterized by a}} deep understanding of the user, creative resolution of tensions, collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach to problem solving can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the problem solving process forms the core of business {{design management}} activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the Aalto University in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.|$|E

In diagnosing the various perceived ills of modernity (e. g., isolation, dehumanization, etc.), Buber believed that the expansion of a purely analytic, material view of existence was at heart an advocation of Ich‑Es relations - even between human beings.

40|$|As concepts, {{communication}} and information are very closely related, {{but they also}} designate more than their usual conceptual meaning when they are called upon in social theories {{as well as in}} philosophical theories about the reality and the truth of social life; information and communication are then designating physical events or event like objects of the observable reality, which will be hereafter described as a procedural ontologization of information. Why do they have this role and how do they play it in contemporary social sciences and philosophy of social sciences? This article questions the scientificity of these concepts in these theoretical contexts. It wants to propose a framework for an epistemology of {{communication and}} information that is critical about the cybernetician paradigm in the social sciences. It presents <b>this</b> <b>paradigm’s</b> main features: informational ontology and probabilistic sociality. It offers a critique of <b>this</b> <b>paradigm’s</b> epistemological and methodological pretensions. It finally exposes the basis of an alternative philosophical theory of communication that wants to support the thesis that the cybernetician paradigmatic communication theory is not scientifically productive; and that it cannot be used in social scientific theoretical contexts without being dramatically redesigned and reoriented towards new goals...|$|R
25|$|In 2015, a new {{paradigm}} for multi-objective optimization based on novelty was presented using evolutionary algorithms. This {{new paradigm}} searches for novel solutions in objective space (i.e., novelty search on objective space) {{in addition to the}} search for non-dominated solutions. Novelty search is like stepping stones guiding the search to previously unexplored places. It is specially useful in overcoming bias and plateaus as well as guiding the search in many-objective optimization problems. Subpopulation Algorithm based on Novelty is the first algorithm based on <b>this</b> <b>paradigm.</b>|$|E

25|$|Surgery is {{not often}} {{considered}} as a treatment option in SCLC (including c-SCLC) due to the high probability of distant metastases {{at the time of}} diagnosis. <b>This</b> <b>paradigm</b> was driven by early studies showing that the administration of systemic therapies resulted in improved survival as compared to patients undergoing surgical resection. Recent studies, however, have suggested that surgery for highly selected, very early-stage c-SCLC patients may indeed improve outcomes. Other experts recommend resection for residual masses of NSCLC components after complete local tumor response to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in c-SCLC.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of the non-Euclidean geometries had a ripple effect which went far {{beyond the boundaries of}} mathematics and science. The philosopher Immanuel Kant's treatment of human knowledge had a special role for geometry. It was his prime example of synthetic a priori knowledge; not derived from the senses nor deduced through logic— our knowledge of space was a truth that we were born with. Unfortunately for Kant, his concept of this unalterably true geometry was Euclidean. Theology was also affected by the change from absolute truth to relative truth in the way that mathematics is related to the world around it, that was a result of <b>this</b> <b>paradigm</b> shift.|$|E
25|$|In many localities, paramedics {{operate as}} a direct {{extension}} of a physician medical director and practice {{as an extension of}} the medical director's license. In the United States, a physician delegates authority under an individual state's Medical Practice Act. This gives a paramedic the ability to practice within limited scope of practice in law, along with state DOH guidelines and medical control oversight. The authority to practice in this manner is granted in the form of standing orders (protocols) (off-line medical control) and direct physician consultation via phone or radio (on-line medical control). Under <b>this</b> <b>paradigm,</b> paramedics effectively assume the role of out-of-hospital field agents to regional emergency physicians, with independent clinical decision.|$|E
