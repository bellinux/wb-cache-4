5|$|Mockingbird nests {{are also}} often parasitized by cowbirds. The parents are found <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> {{parasitic}} eggs at an intermediate rate. A recent study {{has shown that}} foreign eggs {{are more likely to}} be rejected from a nest later in the breeding season than from earlier in a breeding season. Early nesting hosts may not have learned the pattern and coloration of their first clutch yet, so are less likely <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> foreign eggs. There is also a seasonal threshold in terms of the overlap between the breeding seasons of the northern mockingbirds and their parasites. If the breeding season of the parasites starts later, there is less likelihood of parasitism. Hence, it pays the hosts to have relatively lower sensitivity to parasitic eggs.|$|E
