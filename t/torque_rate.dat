40|$|A {{practical}} pinch torque estimator {{based on}} the H∞ filter is proposed for low-cost anti-pinch window control systems. To obtain the acceptable angular velocity measurements, the angular velocity calculation algorithm was proposed with the measurement noise reduction logics in previous method. Apart from the previous works {{based on the}} angular velocity or torque estimates for detecting the pinched condition, the proposed pinch detection algorithm makes use of the <b>torque</b> <b>rate</b> information integrated with state flow chart. To do this, the <b>torque</b> <b>rate</b> is augmented to the system model and the <b>torque</b> <b>rate</b> estimator is derived by applying the steady-state H∞ filter recursion to the model. The motivation of this approach comes from {{the idea that the}} <b>torque</b> <b>rate</b> is less sensitive to the motor parameter uncertainties. Moreover, the statistics of modeling errors and angular velocity measurement noises are actually unknown. Hence, the proposed scheme minimizes the anti-pinch window control system's exposure to the false alarm. To detect the pinched condition, a systematic way to determine the threshold level of the <b>torque</b> <b>rate</b> estimates is also suggested via the deterministic estimation error analysis. Experimental results certify the pinch detection performance of the proposed algorithm and its robustness against the motor parameter uncertainties...|$|E

Lidar-assisted collective pitch control is a simple, but promising approach to reduce the rotor speed variation and structural loads for full load operation.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} solve {{the risk of}} safety on power window, an improved pinch detection algorithm based on the fault detection observer estimation is proposed for an anti-pinch window control system. In designing a residual generator, the proposed fault detection algorithm makes use of the pinch <b>torque</b> <b>rate</b> information by establishing the mathematical model of DC, considered as a fault under the pinched condition. By comparing the residual signal with the pre-designed threshold, the occurrence of pinch is detected. The fault detection observer takes into account robustness against disturbances and sensitivity to faults, simultaneously, {{both of which are}} regarded as optimization problems. In this study, the mixed H-/H∞ performance index and reference model fault detection method are advanced to solve the optimization problem in the Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) which transforms a mathematical problem. The simulation results of the detection time obtained from the two methods are 0. 15 and 0. 07 s, respectively, proving that the use of the fault detection algorithm is effective for an anti-pinch window.

40|$|The time optimal path {{tracking}} for industrial robots regards {{the problem of}} generating trajectories that follow predefined end-effector (EE) paths in shortest time possible taking into account kinematic and dynamic constraints. The complicated tasks used in industrial applications lead to very long EE paths. At the same time smooth trajectories are mandatory {{in order to increase}} the service life. The consideration of jerk and <b>torque</b> <b>rate</b> restrictions, necessary to achieve smooth trajectories, causes enormous numerical effort, and increases computation times.

The overall trajectory is then found by assembling these splines to the solution for the whole path. Further we will show that by using splines, the jerks are automatically bounded so that the jerk constraints {{do not have to be}} imposed in the optimization, which reduces the computational complexity.

At present, information related to drilling force, drilling <b>torque,</b> <b>rate</b> of drill-bit penetration and drill-bit rotational speed is not available to orthopaedic surgeons, clinicians and researchers as bone drilling is performed manually. Methods: This study demonstrates that bone drilling force data if recorded in-vivo, during the repair of bone fractures, can provide information {{about the quality of the}} bone. To understand the variability and anisotropic behaviour of cortical bone tissue, specimens cut from three anatomic positions of pig and bovine were investigated at the same drilling speed and feed rate. Results: The experimental results showed that the drilling force does not only vary from one animal bone to another, but also vary within the same bone due to its changing microstructure. Drilling force does not give a direct indication of bone quality; therefore it has been correlated with screw pull-out force to provide a realistic estimation of the bone quality. A significantly high value of correlation (r 2 = 0. 93 for pig bones and r 2 = 0. 88 for bovine bones) between maximum drilling force and normalised screw pull-out strength was found.

General linear models with repeated measures were used to assess the influence of load on angular velocities, net torques, powers, and rates of torque development at the ankle, knee, and hip joint. The results suggest that the biomechanical demands required from the lower extremities change with the lifted load and to an extent depend on the respective joint. Most notably, the hip and knee extended significantly faster than the ankle independent of load, while the hip and ankle generally produced significantly higher torques than the knee. <b>Torque,</b> <b>rate</b> of torque development, and power at the ankle and knee joint were maximal at 85 % and 75 % of 1 -RM, respectively, whereas torque and rate of torque development at the hip were maximal at loads above 75 % and 85 % of 1 -RM, respectively.

Methods: Asymmetrical deficit was calculated ((fractured/sum both lower-limbs) x 100 %) for isometric knee extension <b>torque,</b> <b>rate</b> of force development during isometric testing, and leg extension power. The asymmetrical measure for lower-limb muscle mass was calculated (fractured-non-fractured), and that of lower-limb pain and disease and injury burden (nonfractured-fractured).

Regression analyses showed that asymmetrical measures of lower-limb pain, muscle mass and disease and injury burden predicted asymmetrical deficit in knee extension torque (R 2 = 0. 43) and rate of force development (R 2 = 0. 36). More intense pain and disease and injury burden affecting the non-fractured limb and smaller muscle mass relative to the fractured limb were associated with a smaller asymmetrical deficit.

40|$|International audienceFeedrate interpolation, which {{consists}} in generating the set points {{sent to the}} axis controllers from the initial path, constitutes a major line of the trajectory planning process. In multi-axis high speed machining the feedrate is usually evaluated by a kinematic method as the maximum fee-drate respecting the joint velocity, acceleration an jerk limits. However this approach requires a difficult experimental tuning of the kinematic limits based on the observation of the axis behaviour {{that leads to a}} loss of productivity. The multiplication of the kinds of multi-axis machines in manufacturing leads to the need to take the dynamic behaviour into account, particularly for highly dynamic systems such as serial robots. A novel and efficient dynamic approach of the feedrate interpolation process is proposed in this paper. The system performance characteristics are checked through torque and <b>torque</b> <b>rate</b> limits at the actu-ator level. The integration of the dynamic model of the system enables to include different chosen effects such as inertia, centrifugal, Coriolis effects, gravity, and friction forces. The dynamic model can be also easily adapted to different systems and processes such as serial manufacturing robots or multi-axis machining centers. Then, these new dynamic constraints lead to limit values based on the dynamic behaviour of the whole axis mechanical chain from the actua-tor to the end-effector, and allow to be close from the system components technology. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated by several simulations on different systems and test paths and is compared to the usual kine-matic method results. M. Vulliez-S. Lavernhe-O.

The bus voltage level is adjusted to the required PMSM terminal voltage in each operating point. Doing so, switching losses can be reduced at low speed by lowering the bus voltage. At high speed, the voltage level is boosted and field-weakening operation and the associated additional losses are avoided. An 11 kW PMSM drive, with an active front-end controlling the bus voltage, is used as a test setup to mimic a series-hybrid drivetrain.
