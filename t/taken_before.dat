5|$|Gosse had {{collected}} the British Museum specimen of Oryzomys antillarum in 1845, {{but may not}} have separated it from introduced rats found with it. Coues noted that the two USNM specimens he examined were received after he had written the preceding part of his monograph; later, Thomas and others wrote that these specimens were obtained around 1877, but Ray asserted that they were <b>taken</b> <b>before</b> 1874. No specimens have been collected since.|$|E

5|$|Within the conch fisheries, one of {{the threats}} to {{sustainability}} {{stems from the fact}} that there is almost as much meat in large juveniles as there is in adults, but only adult conchs can reproduce, and thus sustain a population. In many places where adult conchs have become rare due to overfishing, larger juveniles and subadults are <b>taken</b> <b>before</b> they ever mate. On a number of islands, subadults provide the majority of the harvest.|$|E
5|$|Dietary {{supplements}} often contain vitamins, but {{may also}} include other ingredients, such as minerals, herbs, and botanicals.

5|$|In 2379, {{two hundred}} years after the events of Alien 3, {{military}} scientists on the space vessel USM Auriga create a clone of Ellen Ripley, designated Ripley 8, using DNA from blood samples <b>taken</b> <b>before</b> her death. The xenomorph queen's DNA has been mixed in with Ripley's, and the clone grows up with an embryo inside it. The scientists extract the embryo, raise it and collect its eggs while keeping Ripley 8 alive for further study. As {{a result of the}} xenomorphs' DNA inside her, she has enhanced strength and reflexes, blood that is somewhat acidic and a psychic link with the xenomorphs. Additionally, the xenomorph's genetic memory allows the clone to have some of Ripley's memories.|$|E
5|$|In June the {{subcommittee}} met {{to mark up}} the bill. Bordallo's amendment tightening the language prohibiting vessel transport of fins was passed by voice vote. A week later the full committee, after adding an amendment by Faleomavaega requiring that fins {{be attached to the}} carcasses, sent the bill to the full House. In July it was passed by voice vote and referred to the Senate, where it was sponsored by John Kerry of Massachusetts. It was read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. No further action was <b>taken</b> <b>before</b> the 110th Congress adjourned, and the bill died.|$|E

The monarch additionally swears a separate oath to preserve Presbyterian church government in the Church of Scotland and this oath is <b>taken</b> <b>before</b> the coronation.|$|E

It was the final event hosted by the venue after {{it was announced that}} it was being closed down and being replaced with a 42-story skyscraper. Gaga revealed that Roseland was the only venue in New York City that she had never played, although she had visited there previously to watch shows. A poster announcing the event was released, showing an old image of Gaga <b>taken</b> <b>before</b> the time she became successful as a recording artist.|$|E
5|$|Meetings {{could take}} place either inside or outside of the formal {{boundary}} of the city (the pomerium), though the official meeting place, or curia was at {{the centre of the}} Roman forum. The president of the Senate was normally one of the consuls, but it could be called to meet by any of the praetors or tribunes, both of whom had the authority to call the Senate, though praetors rarely did so unless the consuls were away and the tribunes almost never did so. Meetings were suffused in religious ritual. Temples were a preferred meeting site and auspices would be <b>taken</b> <b>before</b> the meeting could commence.|$|E

5|$|Preparedness {{refers to}} {{precautions}} {{that should be}} <b>taken</b> <b>before</b> a thunderstorm. Some preparedness {{takes the form of}} general readiness (as a thunderstorm can occur at any time of the day or year). Preparing a family emergency plan, for example, can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly. Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees, which can be blown over in high winds, can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterward, Alan Ray {{came back}} into the picture, {{claiming}} that he had proof the card had been doctored by Mastro at one point after the initial $25,000 trade in 1985. He had a photograph of the card <b>taken</b> <b>before</b> the transaction with Mastro and claimed that the card in the photo looked significantly different from the photo of Gretzky's card. He sent the comparison of the two photos to both McNall and Sotheby's, but never received a response back. Some memorabilia collectors have dismissed Ray's claims, saying that the photo hardly proves any doctoring was ever done on the card.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} now under a rector, who {{replaced}} the lay abbot; and any remaining priests of the clas and their abod were presumably expelled. If one accepts {{the evidence of}} the inquisition <b>taken</b> <b>before</b> Rhys ap Gruffydd, lieutenant of the Justiciar, at Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn, 1 September 1326 (which conflicts with Gerald's account), as early as 1212 there were apparently only two monks (from St Peter's, Gloucester) in residence. However, {{it is difficult to see}} how they can have remained, in light of Welsh control of the area; possibly they had only arrived in 1211; we don't know whether there was a priest resident (one of the monks might have been a priest).|$|E

5|$|Those {{involved}} were <b>taken</b> <b>before</b> a tribunal in November 1913, {{where the}} leaders freely stated their intentions of overthrowing the French colonial regime. Of the 111 people arrested, the tribunal convicted 104, of whom 63 received prison sentences. During the trial, some community leaders {{wrote to the}} Governor-General of Indochina, blaming French oppression of the populace through corvee labour and the confiscation of land, for the discontent {{that led to the}} uprising. The prosecutor also criticised the way in which colonial authorities operated.|$|E
5|$|When {{the state}} would not enforce his {{order to reduce the}} catch of non-Indian {{commercial}} fishermen, Boldt took direct action, placing the matter under federal supervision. The United States Coast Guard and the National Marine Fisheries Service were ordered to enforce the ruling and soon had boats in the water confronting violators. Some of the protesters rammed Coast Guard boats and at least one member of the Coast Guard was shot. Those whom the officers caught breaking the court's orders were <b>taken</b> <b>before</b> federal magistrates and fined for contempt, and the illegal fishing as a protest stopped. The United States District Court continued to exercise jurisdiction over the matter, determining traditional fishing locations and compiling major orders of the court.|$|E
5|$|A person's {{history of}} taking {{paracetamol}} is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis. The {{most effective way}} to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug nomogram developed in 1975, called the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion. To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury. A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be {{in the process of being}} absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a serum level <b>taken</b> <b>before</b> 4hours is not recommended.|$|E
