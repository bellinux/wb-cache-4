5|$|Beer is {{consumed}} {{out of a}} variety of vessels, such as a glass, a beer stein, a mug, a pewter <b>tankard,</b> a beer bottle or a can; or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs, from a plastic cup. The shape of the glass from which beer {{is consumed}} can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style. Breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion, as this increases sales of their product.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{athletic}} event {{held at the}} stadium was the Vaux Breweries International Athletics meet in July 1961. According to its sponsors, the highlight of this meet was the team three-mile race, won by the Blackpool and Fylde Athletic club who were awarded a gold <b>tankard</b> as their prize. Attracted by a prize fund of £500 and the imminent AAA Championships in London, the event attracted several athletes from New Zealand, including reigning 5000m metre Olympic champion Murray Halberg and Peter Snell, the reigning 800m Olympic champion. Watched by a capacity crowd of 10,000 spectators, the men won their respective races; Halberg placed first in the mile {{with a time of}} 4:03:70 and Snell led a New Zealand one-two in the 880-yard event, finishing ahead of teammate Gary Philpott in 1:50:40.|$|E

5|$|As {{the ship}} was {{intended}} {{to function as a}} floating, self-contained community, it was stocked with victuals (food and drink) that could sustain its inhabitants for extended periods of time. The casks used for storage on the Mary Rose have been compared with those from a wreck of a trade vessel from the 1560s and have revealed that they were of better quality, more robust and reliable, an indication that supplies for the Tudor navy were given high priority, and their requirements set a high standard for cask manufacturing at the time. As a miniature society at sea, the wreck of the Mary Rose held personal objects belonging to individual crew members. This included clothing, games, various items for spiritual or recreational use, and objects related to mundane everyday tasks such as personal hygiene, fishing, and sewing. The master carpenter's chest, for example, contained a backgammon set, a book, three plates, a sundial, and a <b>tankard,</b> goods suggesting he was relatively wealthy.|$|E

25|$|There {{have long}} been tales of hauntings at The Grotto, mainly {{relating}} to a smuggler named John the Jibber who was reputedly murdered by his fellow criminals after selling information to HM Customs. It is {{said that he was}} hung in a barrel in a cave close to the present lift shaft and left to starve. Until the pub was sold by Vaux, it was said that the landlord would leave out a special <b>tankard</b> of ale each night after closing and, in the morning, it would be empty. Local DJ and TV presenter, Alan Robson drank from the <b>tankard</b> during one of his live Metro Radio shows, allegedly sparking off a series of supernatural phenomena that eventually forced the then landlord to quit. This included flying ashtrays smashing against the wall and flooding in the cellar after all the beer taps were inexplicably turned on. Unfortunately the original <b>tankard</b> was lost during refurbishment. A replacement is on display, but is no longer filled up each night for the ghost. The pub was also the venue for a uktv investigation in 2001, where paranormal researchers claimed to have identified at least seven different spirits.|$|E

50|$|In {{previous}} centuries, the pewter {{used to make}} <b>tankards</b> often contained lead, which {{exposed the}} drinker to medical effects ranging from heavy metal poisoning to gout.

Clay <b>tankards</b> became prevalent in this area. Pewter is now widely lead-free.|$|R
25|$|In 1997–98, the relegation was avoided on {{the final}} day as goals from Martin Foyle, Jan Jansson and Lee Mills secured a 4–0 win over Huddersfield Town, at the expense of Manchester City and Stoke City. The next season was another struggle, and John Rudge was {{controversially}} sacked in January 1999. He was replaced by former player Brian Horton, who spent big to secure the club's a second consecutive final-day escape. There was no escaping the drop in 1999–2000 however, as they were some thirteen points short of safety. Horton led the club to LDV Vans Trophy success in 2001, beating Brentford in the final at the Millennium Stadium, Marc Bridge-Wilkinson and Steve Brooker getting the goals. Following this the Valiants lost the services of veterans Tony Naylor and Allen <b>Tankard,</b> and a disappointing 14th-place finish followed in 2001–02. At the end of 2002, Bill Bell called in the administrators, with the club around £1.5 million in debt. Valiant 2001 secured control of the club after a long and drawn-out process as the season neared its close.|$|E

500|$|Modern {{sans-serif}} designs {{inspired by}} Gill often adapt the concept {{by creating a}} design better proportioned and spaced for body text, a wider and more homogeneous range of weights, something easier since {{the arrival of the}} computer due to the use of multiple master or interpolated font design, or more irregular and hand-drawn in style. Jeremy Tankard's Bliss and Volker Küster's Today Sans are modern variations; <b>Tankard</b> commented on the genre's eclipse that his aim was to create [...] "the first commercial typeface with an English feel since Gill Sans". Rowton Sans is inspired by Gill but has a nearly upright italic, similar to that used by Gill in his serif font Joanna. More distantly, Arthur Vanson's Chesham Sans is inspired by the British tradition of sans-serif signpainting, with many similarities to Gill's work. Bitstream's Humanist 521 was an unofficial digitisation, to which its Russian licensee ParaType added a Cyrillic version in 1997. The companies SoftMaker and Fontsite also released Gill Sans digitisations under different names including 'Chantilly', 'Gibson' and others.|$|E
