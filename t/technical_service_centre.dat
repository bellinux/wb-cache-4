To {{the end of his}} life, Roger Guérillot used two first names in legal documents, Léon et Charles, and said that he had been a student at the École Spéciale des Travaux Publics (ETSP) before being hired by Michelin in 1928 to work as an engineer in their <b>technical</b> <b>service</b> <b>centre</b> in Paris. The historian Pierre Kalck claims that he was only a mechanic, dispatched to French Equatorial Africa in 1928 to work on the steamships. In 1935, Guérillot left Michelin and moved to Ubangi-Shari where he worked for the Society of African Mechanics and then the Society for Forestry and Industrial Exploitation (SEFI). Following the invasion of France by Axis forces in July 1940, Guérillot joined the Free French. For his services he was awarded the Resistance Medal and the Commemorative medal for voluntary service in Free France after the war.|$|E

40|$|M. Environmental Management, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Eskom Holdings SOC Limited (referred to as Eskom), {{a public}} state owned company, is {{required}} to continually demonstrate environmental duty of care and report on its environmental performance. In furthering its commitment to sustainable development and in line with environmental compliance of its activities, Eskom is planning to have the Distribution Division certified against the International Organisation for Standardization (ISO) 14001 : 2004 environmental management system (EMS) standard by 2014. In general, management review may quickly turn into a dry review of {{the items on the}} agenda, done only to show an auditor the review was held. As such, the aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effectiveness of management reviews as one of the key continual improvement elements of the ISO 14001 : 2004 environmental management system within Eskom Distribution: Western Region. This research has been designed to take place in three stages. These stages are planning, execution and publication, and preparing the dissertation for marking. The research methodology included a literature study on various national and international articles and journals on EMSs that relate to environmental performance. The databases of Eskom Distribution: Western Region ‒ i. e. the management review presentation results for the 2008 / 09, 2009 / 10 and 2010 / 11 financial years, key significant environmental aspects for the <b>Technical</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Centres</b> (TSCs) and Minor/Major Engineering Works (MEW), key performance indicators (KPIs), Risk Audit System (RAS) results, and results of the external EMS audit conducted from 23 – 25 April 2007 were used for this research. Questionnaires were sent to the TSCs’ senior supervisors and Safety, Health, Environment and Quality (SHEQ) management. An analysis of the questionnaires completed by the TSC senior supervisors showed that all the participants have seen an improvement in environmental performance due to annual management reviews, except TSC 11, who have not seen management review results. It can be concluded from the results of the SHEQ management questionnaires that an improvement (continual improvement as per the ISO 14001 requirement) was observed. The improvements were identified through improved processes, improved gap analysis, increased environmental awareness, and addressing risks. Most of the ISO 14001 : 2004 requirements for the management review for all financial years covered in this study were met. In terms of the objectives, targets and KPIs, Eskom Distribution: Western Region performed effectively and most of the outcomes were implemented according to the recommendations. Further, based on the external audit conducted from 23 to 25 April 2007, it is clear that Eskom Distribution: Western Region conformed to the minimum requirements of the ISO 14001 : 2004 EMS. Their management reviews also met all requirements of the ISO 14001 : 2004 relating to management review. This was proven by minutes of previous meetings that covered all the necessary issues that were audited. Thus, the existence of management reviews contributed towards ensuring that the ISO system was scrutinised and improved where it worked, and that aspects that did not work well were removed.

" (Reitz, 2009) In the past 10 years or so, <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> experienced tremendous changes due to advances in technology, scholarly communication, research, information retrieval and higher education. Have the employers' expectations for head of <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> positions changed in the past 10 years or so? This study uses job ads for head of <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> positions in academic libraries to answer the following research questions.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} factors that {{influence}} perceived and expected daily task competencies for <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> administrators; that is, the competencies <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> administrators claim to possess (perceived) and those they believe they ought to possess (expected) in the areas of acquisitions, cataloging, and serials. For the purposes of this paper, a <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> administrator is one who oversees, at a minimum, the acquisitions, cataloging, and serials units in her library. The author surveyed 116 <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> administrators via e-mail in Fall 2003, receiving a response rate of fifty-four percent and an acceptable use rate of fifty-three percent. The survey was designed to correlate perceived and expected competencies with (1) an incumbent’s professional background; (2) tenure in current position at present institution; and (3) size of <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> unit as measured in full-time equivalents (FTE). The study concludes that incumbent tenure and size of the <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> unit affect both perceived and expected competencies, with the latter having a greater effect. Professional background affects competency possession, but has only a marginal effect on competency expectation. The findings reveal that administrators with ten or more years in their current positions, who have non-cataloging backgrounds, and who have at least ten FTE in their <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> units are least likely to know the daily procedures of their <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> units.

The poster {{reports on the}} research findings about the roles of paraprofessionals in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> in academic libraries in the previous five years. Due to factors including technological advances, budget cuts, reorganizations, downsizing, outsourcing, expanded roles of professionals {{and changes in the}} information world, the workload among professionals and paraprofessionals has been redistributed in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> in academic libraries. Today, paraprofessionals manage major functional areas in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> and dominate the <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> work force. The roles of paraprofessionals have expanded to include duties that used to be considered the sole responsibilities of professionals in <b>technical</b> <b>services.</b> In 2011, the author conducted a survey to understand more about the roles of paraprofessionals in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> in academic libraries in the previous five years. The survey was designed to answer the following research questions: 1.
