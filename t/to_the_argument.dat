5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> {{over the}} need for manned aircraft, additional political machinations {{had the effect of}} complicating the project. In September 1957 the Ministry of Supply informed the heads of the aviation companies that the only acceptable proposals would be those issued from teams consisting of more than one company. There were a large number of competing aircraft manufacturing companies in the UK while orders were decreasing, thus the government intended to foster cooperation between certain companies and encourage mergers.|$|E
5|$|Related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> from {{morality}} {{is the argument}} from conscience, associated with eighteenth-century bishop Joseph Butler and nineteenth-century cardinal John Henry Newman. Newman proposed that the conscience, as well as giving moral guidance, provides evidence of objective moral truths which must be supported by the divine. He argued that emotivism is an inadequate explanation of the human experience of morality because people avoid acting immorally, even when it might be in their interests. Newman proposed that, to explain the conscience, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|Whilst the {{government}} is eager to implement the changes, many oppose the proposal, some on civil liberties grounds.

Indeed, in some jurisdictions (e.g. Scotland), individuals are considered to reach full maturity at 16.|$|E

5|$|Plantinga's {{free will}} defense begins by asserting that Mackie's {{argument}} failed {{to establish an}} explicit logical contradiction between God {{and the existence of}} evil. In other words Plantinga shows that (1-4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian's implicit unstated assumptions, assumptions representing premises not stated in the argument itself. With an explicit contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add premises <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> for it to succeed. Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further argument then an atheologian's intuitive impressions that a contradiction must exist would have remain unanswered. Plantinga sought to resolve this by offering two further points.|$|E

25|$|But Lewis later {{agreed with}} Elizabeth Anscombe's {{response}} to his Miracles argument.

25|$|In an 1825 plebiscite, {{the region}} of Partido de Nicoya chose {{to be part of}} Costa Rica, {{becoming}} Guanacaste Province. Costa Rica annexed Guanacaste, in exchange for giving up her claims to sovereignty over the San Juan River and the Canal Route. However, when tensions between the nations rise over Costa Rica's rights of navigation in the river, Nicaragua often brings up the topic of Guanacaste as a counterpoint <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument.</b>|$|E

25|$|Since the {{characteristic}} {{function of a}} convolution {{is the product of}} {{the characteristic}} functions of the densities involved, the central limit theorem has yet another restatement: the product of the characteristic functions of a number of density functions becomes close to the characteristic function of the normal density as the number of density functions increases without bound, under the conditions stated above.
