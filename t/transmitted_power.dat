5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>power</b> but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} function {{provided by}} the carrier in standard AM, but which is lost in either single or double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission, is that it provides an amplitude reference. In the receiver, the automatic gain control (AGC) responds to the carrier so that the reproduced audio level stays in a fixed proportion to the original modulation. On the other hand, with suppressed-carrier transmissions there is no <b>transmitted</b> <b>power</b> during pauses in the modulation, so the AGC must respond to peaks of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>power</b> during peaks in the modulation. This typically involves a so-called fast attack, slow decay circuit which holds the AGC level {{for a second or}} more following such peaks, in between syllables or short pauses in the program. This is very acceptable for communications radios, where compression of the audio aids intelligibility. However it is absolutely undesired for music or normal broadcast programming, where a faithful reproduction of the original program, including its varying modulation levels, is expected.|$|E
25|$|Morse code {{is usually}} heard at the {{receiver}} as a medium-pitched on/off audio tone (600–1000Hz), so transmissions {{are easier to}} copy than voice through the noise on congested frequencies, {{and it can be}} used in very high noise / low signal environments. The <b>transmitted</b> <b>power</b> is concentrated into a limited bandwidth so narrow receiver filters can be used to suppress interference from adjacent frequencies. The audio tone is usually created by use of a beat frequency oscillator.|$|E
30|$|Each UE’s <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> can be regulated. However, the <b>transmit</b> <b>powers</b> {{have not}} been {{calibrated}} as the experimental setup {{does not allow for}} such a measurement. Nevertheless, we can change the <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> of the UEs by switching between predefined <b>power</b> amplifier (PA) <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> settings, which are denoted by values from − 4 dB to − 32 dB. The PA <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> setting of − 4 dB addresses the highest <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> possible and equals approximately a total <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> of 23 dBm at a bandwidth of 30 PRBs. Since a PA <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> setting ensures a constant <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> density over the complete bandwidth that is allocated, the total UE <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> changes when changing the bandwidth of the UE. In order to decrease the receive power of UE 0 even more than it is possible with the <b>transmit</b> <b>power,</b> we add a fixed 20 dB attenuator for this UE’s UL transmission (see Fig. 2).|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{analyze the}} {{capacity}} of an opportunistic scheduling system in a spectrum sharing environment where multiple secondary users can share a frequency spectrum with multiple primary users as long as secondary users do not cause interference power exceeding a given threshold to the primary users. We consider three different power control schemes of secondary users: fixed <b>transmit</b> <b>power,</b> adaptive <b>transmit</b> <b>power,</b> and infinite <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> schemes. Our numerical and simulation results show that {{the capacity of}} the adaptive <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> scheme {{is similar to that of}} the fixed <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> scheme in the low <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> region, while the capacity of the adaptive <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> scheme is close to that of the infinite <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> scheme in the high <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> region and is saturated beyond a certain point.

25|$|The cyclic prefix, {{which is}} {{transmitted}} during the guard interval, {{consists of the}} end of the OFDM symbol copied into the guard interval, and the guard interval is transmitted followed by the OFDM symbol. The reason that the guard interval consists of a copy {{of the end of}} the OFDM symbol is so that the receiver will integrate over an integer number of sinusoid cycles for each of the multipaths when it performs OFDM demodulation with the FFT. In some standards such as Ultrawideband, in the interest of <b>transmitted</b> <b>power,</b> cyclic prefix is skipped and nothing is sent during the guard interval. The receiver will then have to mimic the cyclic prefix functionality by copying the end part of the OFDM symbol and adding it to the beginning portion.|$|E
25|$|Hydrokinetic {{transmission}} (also called hydrodynamic transmission) uses a {{torque converter}}. A torque converter {{consists of three}} main parts, two of which rotate, and one (the stator) that has a lock preventing backwards rotation and adding output torque by redirecting the oil flow at low output RPM. All three main parts are sealed in an oil-filled housing. To match engine speed to load speed over the entire speed range of a locomotive some additional method is required to give sufficient range. One method is to follow the torque converter with a mechanical gearbox which switches ratios automatically, similar to an automatic transmission on a car. Another method is to provide several torque converters each {{with a range of}} variability covering part of the total required; all the torque converters are mechanically connected all the time, and the appropriate one for the speed range required is selected by filling it with oil and draining the others. The filling and draining is carried out with the transmission under load, and results in very smooth range changes with no break in the <b>transmitted</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{disturbance}} to {{the field}} inside the line caused by the insertion of the probe is minimised as far as possible. [...] There are two parts to this disturbance. [...] The first part {{is due to the}} power the probe has extracted from the line and manifests as a lumped equivalent circuit of a resistor. [...] This is minimised by limiting the distance the probe is inserted into the line so that only enough power is extracted for the detector to operate effectively. [...] The second part of the disturbance is due to energy stored in the field around the probe and manifests as a lumped equivalent of a capacitor. [...] This capacitance can be cancelled out with an inductance of equal and opposite impedance. [...] Lumped inductors are not practical at microwave frequencies; instead, an adjustable stub with an inductive equivalent circuit is used to [...] "tune out" [...] the probe capacitance. [...] The result is an equivalent circuit of a high impedance in shunt across the line which has little effect on the <b>transmitted</b> <b>power</b> in the line. [...] The probe is more sensitive {{as a result of this}} tuning and the distance it is inserted can be further limited as a result.|$|E

2500|$|In principle, the {{transmitted}} pulses can {{be generated}} by applying impulses to the input of the dispersive transmit filter, with the resultant output chirp amplified as necessary for transmission. [...] Alternatively, a voltage controlled oscillator {{may be used to}} generate the chirp signal. [...] To achieve maximum <b>transmitted</b> <b>power</b> (and so achieve maximum range) it is normal for a radar system to transmit chirp pulses at constant amplitude from a transmitter run in a near-limiting condition. [...] The chirp signals reflected from targets are amplified in the receiver and then processed by the compression filter to give narrow pulses of high amplitude, as previously described.|$|E

2500|$|Compression is used {{in voice}} {{communications}} in amateur radio that employ SSB modulation. [...] Often {{it is used to}} make a particular station's signal more readable to a distant station, or to make one's station's transmitted signal stand out against others. [...] This occurs especially in pileups where amateur radio stations are competing for the opportunity to talk to a DX station. Since an SSB signal's amplitude depends on the level of modulation, the net result is that the average amplitude of the signal and hence average <b>transmitted</b> <b>power</b> would be stronger than it would be had compression not been used. [...] Most modern amateur radio SSB transceivers have speech compressors built in.|$|E
2500|$|During August 1936, WOWO was {{acquired}} by Westinghouse Broadcasting as its first radio station purchase, joining original Westinghouse outlets KDKA in Pittsburgh, KYW in Philadelphia, WBZ in Boston and WBZA in Springfield, Massachusetts. Westinghouse built new studios for WOWO at 925 South Harrison Street in Fort Wayne, which were completed on May 1, 1937. [...] On that same date WOWO joined the NBC Blue Network, while maintaining its CBS network affiliation, as multiple network affiliations were common for NBC-Blue affiliates. On March 29, 1941 Westinghouse completed the FCC licensing of WOWO's famous clear-channel broadcasting on 1190kHz. During and after World War II, these clear-channel broadcasts made WOWO a popular radio super-station of sorts throughout the eastern United States. Although there were other radio stations in the eastern United States broadcasting on 1190kHz during daylight hours, they were required by the FCC either to cease broadcasting at sunset or to reduce their <b>transmitted</b> <b>power</b> at sunset {{to make way for}} WOWO's clear-channel signal. WOWO's clear-channel license and resulting large audience permitted various owners over the years to consider WOWO their flagship station.|$|E

Its [...] "zero lift" [...] aerodynamics were {{a big part of}} keeping it drivable. The 959 also featured Porsche-Steuer Kupplung (PSK) which was at the time the most advanced all-wheel-drive system in a production car. Capable of dynamically changing the torque distribution between the rear and front wheels in both normal and slip conditions, the PSK system gave the 959 the adaptability it needed both as a race car and as a [...] "super" [...] street car. Under hard acceleration, PSK could send as much as 80% of available power to the rear wheels, helping {{make the most of the}} rear-traction bias that occurs at such times. It could also vary the power bias depending on road surface and grip changes, helping maintain traction at all times. The dashboard featured gauges displaying the amount of rear differential slip as well as <b>transmitted</b> <b>power</b> to the front axle. [...] The magnesium alloy wheels were unique, being hollow inside to form a sealed chamber contiguous with the tire and equipped with a built-in tire pressure monitoring system.|$|E
30|$|In this section, {{we propose}} a feedback-based <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> and carrier phase {{adjustment}} scheme {{that controls the}} <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> level and carrier phase offset in order to fully exploit the MPR channel capacity. The proposed <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> and carrier phase adjustment scheme has two steps.

The second is the optimal <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> and carrier phase adjustment, which computes the optimal <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> level and carrier phase offset, and feeds the information—which includes the optimal <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> levels and carrier phase shifts—back to the transmitters as described in Figure  1. The optimal <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> levels and carrier phase offsets are obtained for a given modulation scheme based on the placement of constellation points that maximize the minimum Euclidean distance between the points.|$|R
