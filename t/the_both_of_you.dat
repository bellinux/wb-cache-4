C-Mix allows you to get <b>the</b> best <b>of</b> <b>both</b> worlds: <b>you</b> write <b>the</b> easy-to-understand programs, and C-Mix turns them into equivalent, ecient ones. As C-Mix is fully automatic, this allows for faster and more reliable maintenance of software systems: system programmers need not spend hours on guring out and altering the complicated, ecient code. C-Mix is a program specializer: Given a program written in C for solving a general problem, C-Mix generates faster programs that solve more specic instances of the problem. Application areas include model simulators, hardware verication tools, scientic numerical calculations, ray tracers, in-terpreters for programming languages (Java bytecode interpreters, task-specic interpreters), pattern matchers and operating system routines. C-Mix currently runs on Unix systems supporting the GNU C compiler, and treats programs strictly conforming to the ISO C standard.

The song's lyrical content {{has been described as}} reflective and confessional as it delves into different parts of Drake's life. It begins with Aiko's verse, which towards the end she sings [...] "I love me, I love me enough for <b>the</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us/That's why <b>you</b> trust me, I know you been through more than most of us/So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?/Darling you, you give but you cannot take love", which becomes the hook for the entire track. The song deals with Drake's past relationships with other women. According to Aaron Matthews of Exclaim!, the song [...] "Jhene Aiko deflates Drake's ego while he meditates on selfishness, immaturity and arrogance in past relationships over sumptuous keys." [...] "From Time" [...] also features a reference to a woman named [...] "Courtney from Hooters", who was later discovered to be a waitress at the restaurant and a model. Katie Hasty of HitFix was critical of the mention of his former relationships on the song, calling it petty and accused him [...] "intentionally inflicting his exes and with the same spotlight that so alienates him."
