At this juncture, I feel like asking the Maharashtrian people that if I am voicing your true emotion, <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>are</b> you sitting on the fence. Come join me in this struggle." ...|$|E

6000|$|Was Augustus George {{intended}} to have limbs, {{or to be}} born a Torso? I presume that limbs were the intention, as they are the usual practice. <b>Then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>are</b> my poor child's limbs fettered and tied up?

6000|$|... "Is it so? <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>are</b> you {{so careful}} to hide your wisdom {{which should be}} open like a flower for us poor bees to suck at? Well, I am glad to learn that you are wise, for in this book of magic that I have been reading I find {{problems}} worthy of Khaemuas the departed, whom I only remember as a brooding, black-browed man much like my cousin, Amenmeses his son--save {{that no one can}} call Amenmeses wise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop a bit, stop a bit," [...] says Mr. Stewart. [...] "What's all this? A Whig? <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>are</b> {{you here}} with Alan's button? {{and what kind}} of a black-foot traffic is this that I find ye out in, Mr. Whig? Here is a {{forfeited}} rebel and an accused murderer, with two hundred pounds on his life, and ye ask me to meddle in his business, and then tell me ye're a Whig! I have no mind of any such Whigs before, though I've kennt plenty of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus invited, Mr. Chadband steps forth, {{and after}} a little sleek smiling and a little oil-grinding with the palms of his hands, {{delivers}} himself as follows, [...] "My friends, we are now--Rachael, my wife, and I--in the mansions {{of the rich and}} great. Why are we now in the mansions of the rich and great, my friends? Is it because we are invited? Because we are bidden to feast with them, because we are bidden to rejoice with them, because we are bidden to play the lute with them, because we are bidden to dance with them? No. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>are</b> we here, my friends? Air we in possession of a sinful secret, and do we require corn, and wine, and oil, or what is much the same thing, money, for the keeping thereof? Probably so, my friends." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "And if you astrologers {{answer that}} it is {{precisely}} because of this distance and smallness that their influences <b>are</b> negligible, <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> it that you claim a great influence for the smallest heavenly body, Mercury? <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> it that you have given an influence to al-Ra's and al-Dhanab, which are two imaginary points and descending nodes?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "O most unfortunate Prahlada, {{you have}} always {{described}} a supreme being other than me, a supreme being who is above everything, who is the controller of everyone, and who is all-pervading.

6000|$|... "You have an adorable way {{of making}} {{yourself}} understood," [...] she laughed. [...] "Come, do let us talk sense {{for a minute or}} two.

60|$|How {{many are}} there who never yet did {{one thing to}} make their companions better, and yet have done many a thing to make their companions worse! <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>are</b> they alive still? Why does not God rid Himself of them at once and let them die, instead of cumbering the ground? I know but one reason. If they were only God's plants, or His stock, or His servants, He might rid Himself of them. But they are {{something}} far nearer and dearer to Him than that. They are His children, and therefore He has mercy on them. They are redeemed by {{the blood of the}} Lord Jesus Christ, the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world; and therefore {{for the sake of the}} Lord Jesus Christ, God looks on them with long-suffering and tender loving-kindness. Man was made in God's likeness at first, and was the son of God. And therefore howsoever fallen and corrupt man's nature is now, yet God loves him still, even though he be a heathen or an infidel. How much more for you, my friends, who know that you are God's children, who have been declared to be His children by Holy Baptism, and grafted into Christ's church. You at least are bound to believe that God preserves you from death, because He loves you. He protects you every day and every hour, as a father takes care of His children, and keeps them out of dangers which they cannot see or understand.|$|E
6000|$|My dear Reynolds--Ever since I {{wrote to}} my Brothers from Southampton I {{have been in}} a taking--and at this moment I am about to become settled--for I have {{unpacked}} my books, put them into a snug corner, pinned up Haydon, Mary Queen of Scots, and Milton with his daughters in a row. In the passage I found a head of Shakspeare which I had not before seen. It is most likely the same that George spoke so well of, for I like it extremely. Well--this head I have hung over my Books, just above the three in a row, having first discarded a French Ambassador--now this alone is a good morning's work. Yesterday I went to Shanklin, which occasioned a great debate in my mind whether I should live there or at Carisbrooke. Shanklin is a most beautiful place--Sloping wood and meadow ground reach round the Chine, which is a cleft between the Cliffs of the depth of nearly 300 feet at least. This cleft is filled with trees and bushes in the narrow part, and as it widens becomes bare, {{if it were not for}} primroses on one side, which spread to the very verge of the Sea, and some fishermen's huts on the other, perched midway in the Balustrades of beautiful green Hedges along their steps down to the sands. But the sea, Jack, the sea--the little waterfall--then the white cliff--then St. Catherine's Hill--"the sheep in the meadows, the cows in the corn." [...] <b>Then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>are</b> you at Carisbrooke? say you. Because, in the first place, I should be at twice the Expense, and three times the inconvenience--next that from here I can see your continent--from a little hill close by the whole north Angle of the Isle of Wight, with the water between us. In the 3rd place, I see Carisbrooke Castle from my window, and have found several delightful wood-alleys, and copses, and quick freshes.[12] As for primroses--the Island ought to be called Primrose Island--that is, if the nation of Cowslips agree thereto, of which there are divers Clans just beginning to lift up their heads. Another reason of my fixing is, that I am more in reach of the places around me. I intend to walk over the Island east--West--North--South. I have not seen many specimens of Ruins--I don't think however I shall ever see one to surpass Carisbrooke Castle. The trench is overgrown with the smoothest turf, and the Walls with ivy. The Keep within side is one Bower of ivy--a colony of Jackdaws have been there for many years. I dare say I have seen many a descendant of some old cawer who peeped through the Bars at Charles the first, when he was there in Confinement. On the road from Cowes to Newport I saw some extensive Barracks, which disgusted me extremely with the Government for placing such a Nest of Debauchery in so beautiful a place. I asked a man on the Coach about this--and he said that the people had been spoiled. In the room where I slept at Newport, I found this on the Window--"O Isle spoilt by the milatary!..." ...|$|E

50|$|The quantal {{theory of}} speech is a phonetic answer {{to one of}} the {{fundamental}} questions of phonology, specifically: if each language community is free to arbitrarily select a system of phonemes or segments, <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>are</b> the phoneme inventories of different languages so similar?
