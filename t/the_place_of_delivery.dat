40|$|Jurisdiction - Place of {{delivery}} - Incoterms - Ex works - Free from the seller's premises Facts This preliminary {{reference to the}} Court of Justice of the European Union arose out of a sale of goods contract. The seller was domiciled in Italy, the buyer in France and the goods were sold in Italy. The contract contained a term providing that delivery was to be ‘free from the seller’s premises’ (in the original: ‘Resa: Franco ns. sede’) to a carrier and that the goods would finally be transferred to France. When the buyer was asked {{to pay the price}} of the goods in Italy, it objected that the Italian court did not have jurisdiction to decide the matter. This, in the opinion of the Italian court might trigger the application of art 5 (1) (b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 44 / 2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments on civil and commercial matters, establishing a jurisdiction additional to the domicile of the defendant. In order to decide whether it was competent to deal with the issue, the Italian court had to determine <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b> Was it the place of the final destination of the goods, ie France, or <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> to the carrier, ie Italy? <br/...|$|E

It provides the opportunity to learn about risks associated with pregnancy and guides to plan <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliveries</b> thereby preventing maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. In ‘Pakistan’ antenatal services to rural population are being provided through a network of primary health care facilities designated as 2 ̆ 7 Basic Health Units and Rural Health Centers. Pakistan is a developing country, consisting of four provinces and federally administered areas. Each province is administratively subdivided in to ‘Divisions’ and ‘Districts’. By population ‘Punjab’ is the largest province of Pakistan having 36 districts. This study was conducted to assess the coverage and quality antenatal care in the primary health care facilities in ‘Punjab’ province of ‘Pakistan’. Methods: Quantitative and Qualitative methods were used to collect data. Using multistage sampling technique nine out of thirty six districts were selected and 19 primary health care facilities of public sector (seventeen Basic Health Units and two Rural Health Centers were randomly selected from each district.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The study {{seeks to}} improve {{understanding}} of maternity health seeking behaviors in resource-deprived urban settings. The {{objective of this}} paper is to identify the factors which influence <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> among <b>the</b> urban poor, with a distinction between sub-standard and "appropriate" health facilities. METHODS: The data are from a maternal health project carried out in two slums of Nairobi, Kenya. A total of 1, 927 women were interviewed, and 25 health facilities where they delivered, were assessed. Facilities were classified as either "inappropriate" or "appropriate". <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> is <b>the</b> dependent variable. Ordered logit models were used to quantify the effects of covariates on <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery,</b> defined as a three-category ordinal variable. RESULTS: Although 70 % of women reported that they delivered in a health facility, only 48 % delivered in a facility with skilled attendant. Besides education and wealth, <b>the</b> main predictors <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> included being advised during antenatal care to deliver at a health facility, pregnancy "wantedness", and parity. The influence of health promotion (i. e., being advised during antenatal care visits) was significantly higher among the poorest women. CONCLUSION: Interventions to improve the health of urban poor women should include improvements in the provision of, and access to, quality obstetric health services. Women should be encouraged to attend antenatal care where they can be given advice on delivery care and other pregnancy-related issues. Target groups should include poorest, less educated and higher parity women...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to explore {{pregnant}} women's decision-making and major influences on their preferences for a place of delivery. The study was prompted by the UK government's policy of a woman centred maternity service (Department of Health 1993 b), and the observation that studies had concentrated on professionals' rather than women's views about <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b> Two factors were considered to have potential influence in decision making, one being the individual woman's risk perception related {{to the process of}} childbirth, and the other, knowledge about available options for place of birth. First, a systematic review was conducted, looking at available studies on women's views about <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b> Only 9 studies were found, suggesting a need for more studies. Secondly, a primary study was conducted using in-depth interviews with 20 women planning a hospital birth, and 13 planning a home birth to explore factors that led to their respective choices. Results from the primary study indicate that women were not offered information about the availability of home birth. Consequently, 90 % of those planning a hospital birth did not give thought to where {{they were going to have}} their babies, but assumed they were going to go to hospital. On the other hand, those planning a home birth found information privately and discussed the options with their husbands before making a decision. Additionally, results exposed differences in perception of safety concerning childbirth for subsequent deliveries according to planned place of delivery. Control of the birth process and environment was also found to be important for women planning a home birth. Risk perception and information about available options were found to influence decision-making about the place of birth, thus supporting the hypotheses of the thesis. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out of all 8856 births {{occurring}} at home in England and Wales in 1979. Of these births, 67 % had been booked for delivery at home, 21 % had been booked for delivery in hospital, 3 % had not been booked, and for 9 % <b>the</b> intended <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> was unknown. <b>The</b> perinatal mortality varied almost 50 -fold according to <b>the</b> intended <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery,</b> ranging from 4. 1 / 1000 births in those booked for delivery at home to 196. 6 / 1000 unbooked births. Deliveries that occurred at home but had been booked for a hospital consultant unit were associated with a perinatal mortality of 67. 5 / 1000. Births that had been booked for delivery at home included the smallest proportion of babies of low birth weight: 2. 5 % weighed 2500 g or less compared with 18 % of those booked for consultant units and 29 % of those not booked. Within these low birthweight groups there were noticeable differences in perinatal mortality; births booked to occur at home had the lowest mortality and unbooked births had the highest. Perinatal mortality among babies who weighed more than 2500 g was generally low irrespective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intended <b>place</b> <b>of</b> delivery; <b>the</b> only exception was in babies whose delivery had not been booked.

SETTING [...] A rural health district of 400, 000 population where one third <b>of</b> all <b>deliveries</b> occurred in seven isolated general practitioner maternity units, 8 % in the integrated general practitioner unit, and the remainder in the consultant unit. SUBJECTS [...] All babies <b>of</b> women whose <b>deliveries</b> were booked in the district before the onset of labour or the diagnosis of intrauterine death, excluding twins, babies with lethal congenital malformations, and those less than 2500 g. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Outcome <b>of</b> all <b>deliveries</b> and parity <b>of</b> mothers. RESULTS [...] 14, 415 Deliveries were analysed. The perinatal mortality rate was 2. 8 / 1000 births in the consultant unit (7950 deliveries), 4. 8 in the isolated general practitioner units (5237 deliveries), and zero in the integrated general practitioner unit (1228 deliveries). Perinatal deaths attributable to asphyxia were more common in the isolated general practitioner units (1. 5 per 1000) than the consultant unit (0. 6 per 1000). The perinatal mortality rate among babies born to nulliparous women was 3. 2 / 1000 births in the consultant unit and 5. 7 in the isolated general practitioner units; for those born to multigravid women it was 2. 4 and 4. 2 respectively. CONCLUSIONS [...] The outcome <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> was not influenced by parity. Both antenatal and intrapartum care were responsible for the higher perinatal mortality rate in the isolated general practitioner units. The integrated unit, which shared midwifery staff with the consultant unit, seemed to work well.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: The Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran {{established}} maternity {{facilities in}} order to provide a safe delivery and reduce deliveries at home in rural areas. However, a few of deliveries in Kohgilouyeh and Boyerahmad province took place in these centers. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the delivery status and factors influencing the pregnant women’s tendency to choose <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b> Materials & Methods: This descriptive study was carried out on 747 participants in the rural areas that were covered by maternity facilities in the first three months of 1384. Data were collected by a self-structured questionnaire whose validity and reliability had been determined previously. Data of age, education level, parietal status, antenatal cares, decision-maker for <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery,</b> geographical access to maternity facility centers and the cause of avoidance of referring to the centers were determined asking the women. Data were analyzed by SPSS software and using X 2 statistical test. Results: The results showed that overall 31 % (230 cases) of deliveries took place at home and 51 % (384 cases) at hospital, but only 18 % (133 cases) of deliveries took place at maternity facility centers. There was a significant difference in antenatal education by midwives between women who delivered at home and those that delivered at maternity facility centers, showing that more educated women have managed to deliver at the maternity facility centers (p < 0. 001). 58 % of mothers had selected their delivery place by themselves, but in others the delivery place was selected by their mothers, mothers-in-law, their husbands, etc. Almost 79 % (181 cases) of mothers who delivered at home announced that geographical access (long distance) to the maternity facility was major problem. In addition, there was a significant association between literacy, living place and the number of previous pregnancies with selection of delivery place (p< 0. 005). Conclusion: Findings showed that the most important cause of avoidance of referring to maternity facility centers, from women’s point view, was geographical access to maternity facility centers as well as antenatal education by midwives...|$|E
30|$|The {{import of}} {{household}} electricity, improved toilet facilities and delivery at hospital facilities to child survival {{as indicated by}} this study cannot be overemphasized.

Design: Semi-structured interviews and thematic framework analysis. Setting: UK specialist children's hospital and surrounding primary care trusts. Participants: 37 NHS stakeholders including healthcare professionals, managers, commissioners and executive team members. Results: Participants acknowledged that outreach clinics would involve a change in traditional ways of working and that the physical setting of the clinic would influence aspects of professional practice. Different models of CCTH were discussed, as were alternatives for improving access to specialist care. Participants supported CCTH as a good principle for paediatric outpatient services; however the challenges of setting up and maintaining community clinics meant they questioned how far it could be achieved in practice.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Referral from community midwife to a gynecologist during labor, because of fetal distress, failure to progress in second stage of labor, meconium stained amniotic fluid, failure to progress in first stage of labor, wish for pain relief, a combination of other less urgent reasons or no referral (reference). RESULTS: A total of 241 [*] 595 (32 %) were referred from community midwife to a gynecologist during labor, because of fetal distress (FD; 5 %), failure to progress in second stage of labor (FTP 2; 14 %), meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF; 24 %), failure to progress in first stage of labor (FTP 1; 17 %), wish for pain relief (WFPR; 7 %) {{or a combination of}} other less urgent reasons, for example, malpresentation (e. g. breech) or other nonspecified problems (OTHER; 33 %). The strongest overall risk indicators were gestational age (lower risk of referral because of FD, FTP 2, MSAF, FTP 1 and WFPR and a higher risk of referral because of OTHER at a gestational age between 37 (+ 0) and 37 (+) (6) weeks, and higher risks of referral for all reasons at a gestational age[*]≥ 41 (+) (0) when compared to a gestational age between 38 [*](+) (0) and 40 [*](+) (6) weeks and no referral), <b>the</b> intended <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> (higher risk <b>of</b> all types of referral compared to no referral when <b>the</b> intended <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> was either at a midwife-led birth center or a hospital instead of at home) and birth history (higher risk of all types of referral compared to no referral when women had a history <b>of</b> instrumental vaginal <b>delivery</b> or when they were nulliparous instead of being multiparous without a history of an instrument vaginal delivery).

This research explores the fundamental decisions women make during the birthing process: the amount of prenatal care mothers will receive, the type of health care provider they will use, picking <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery,</b> views on technological and medical interventions, and outlooks on natural childbirth. In addition to an extensive literature review, in-depth interviews with mothers, midwives, and obstetricians are used to examine the various controversies of childbirth. This thesis begins with a review of the transition from midwives to physicians as customary birth attendants in the United States and offers a comparison to obstetric care in Europe. Then comparing the training of obstetricians and midwives and their birthing philosophies to examine the medical and holistic models of childbirth. Finally, first-hand experiences of mothers conclude the research conducted and offer insight on the controversies of childbirth in an age of medical and technological interventions. This research concludes that the transitions in American history have led to the cultural norm of medicalized, hospital births attended by physicians. These societal customs have led to great ambivalence towards alternative methods of childbirth such as not using the medical and technological resources available or using a midwife. With this, there has been a paradox created between the institutional pressures of childbirth and an individual’s choice when deciding what will be involved in a woman’s childbirth experience...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} risk {{indicators for}} referral during labor from community midwife to a gynecologist in a prospective cohort {{of women with}} a singleton term pregnancy, starting labor with a community midwife between 2000 and 2007, registered in the Dutch national perinatal registry. Referral from community midwife to a gynecologist during labor, because of fetal distress, failure to progress in second stage of labor, meconium stained amniotic fluid, failure to progress in first stage of labor, wish for pain relief, a combination of other less urgent reasons or no referral (reference). A total of 241 [*] 595 (32 %) were referred from community midwife to a gynecologist during labor, because of fetal distress (FD; 5 %), failure to progress in second stage of labor (FTP 2; 14 %), meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF; 24 %), failure to progress in first stage of labor (FTP 1; 17 %), wish for pain relief (WFPR; 7 %) {{or a combination of}} other less urgent reasons, for example, malpresentation (e. g. breech) or other nonspecified problems (OTHER; 33 %). The strongest overall risk indicators were gestational age (lower risk of referral because of FD, FTP 2, MSAF, FTP 1 and WFPR and a higher risk of referral because of OTHER at a gestational age between 37 (+ 0) and 37 (+) (6) weeks, and higher risks of referral for all reasons at a gestational age[*]≥ 41 (+) (0) when compared to a gestational age between 38 [*](+) (0) and 40 [*](+) (6) weeks and no referral), <b>the</b> intended <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> (higher risk <b>of</b> all types of referral compared to no referral when <b>the</b> intended <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> was either at a midwife-led birth center or a hospital instead of at home) and birth history (higher risk of all types of referral compared to no referral when women had a history <b>of</b> instrumental vaginal <b>delivery</b> or when they were nulliparous instead of being multiparous without a history of an instrument vaginal delivery). Risk indicators associated with specific reasons of referral were maternal age, ethnicity, degree of urbanization, social economic status, neonatal gender and birth weight. Among low-risk pregnant women, a referral during labor is associated with readily available risk indicators. These risk indicators may be used to increase referral risk awareness and to counsel women for <b>the</b> intended <b>place</b> to start labo...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{examines}} <b>the</b> association between <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery,</b> delivery assistants and perinatal mortality in Nigeria. Previous {{studies have found}} these factors {{to be associated with}} the risk of perinatal mortality. This study therefore aims to determine the extent to which these two factors predict perinatal mortality in the Nigerian context as this information will be useful in informing health policy decisions and actions in so far as a desirable reduction in childhood mortality in Nigeria is concerned. Methods: This study uses cross sectional design through secondary analysis of the 2003 Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). <b>The</b> variables representing <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> and delivery assistants have been fitted into logistic regression models to determine their association with perinatal mortality. Several other known risk factors for perinatal mortality such as maternal education and birth weight, to mention a few, have also been investigated using the logistic regression analysis. Results: 5783 live singleton births were analyzed with 194 newborns dying within the first seven days of life giving an early neonatal mortality rate (ENMR) of 33. 5 per 1000 and an estimated perinatal mortality rate (PNMR) of 72. 4 per 1000 live births. The results also show that <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> [p= 0. 8777] and delivery assistants [p= 0. 3812] are not significantly associated with perinatal mortality even after disaggregating the analysis by rural and urban areas. However being small in size at birth [AOR= 2. 13, CI= 1. 41 – 3. 21], female [AOR= 0. 57, CI= 0. 42 – 0. 77] and having a mother who practiced traditional religion [AOR= 4. 37, CI= 2. 31 – 8. 26], were all significantly associated with perinatal mortality. Conclusions: <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> and delivery assistants are not good predictors of perinatal mortality in the Nigerian context. However various limitations of the study design used such as the issue of uncontrolled confounding may have affected the findings. Nonetheless, the increased risk of perinatal deaths in small babies and the decreased risk of death among female babies are consistent with other studies and have both been attributed elsewhere to biologic mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Clinical studies {{demonstrate}} {{the efficacy of}} interventions to reduce neonatal deaths, but there are fewer studies of their real-life effectiveness. In India, women often seek facility delivery after complications arise, rather than to avoid complications. Our objective was to quantify the association <b>of</b> facility <b>delivery</b> and postnatal checkups with neonatal mortality while examining the "reverse causality" in which the mothers deliver at a health facility due to adverse perinatal events. We conducted nationally representative case-control studies of about 300, 000 live births and 4, 000 neonatal deaths to examine <b>the</b> effect <b>of,</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> and postnatal checkup on neonatal mortality. We compared neonatal deaths to all live births and to a subset of live births reporting excessive bleeding or obstructed labour that were more comparable to cases in seeking care. In the larger study of 2004 - 8 births, facility delivery without postnatal checkup was {{associated with an increased}} odds of neonatal death (Odds ratio = 2. 5; 99 % CI 2. 2 - 2. 9), especially for early versus late neonatal deaths. However, use of more comparable controls showed marked attenuation (Odds ratio = 0. 5; 0. 4 - 0. 5). Facility delivery with postnatal checkup was associated with reduced odds of neonatal death. Excess risks were attenuated in the earlier study of 2001 - 4 births. The combined effect <b>of</b> facility <b>deliveries</b> with postnatal checks ups is substantially higher than just facility <b>delivery</b> alone. Evaluation <b>of</b> the real-life effectiveness of interventions to reduce child and maternal deaths need to consider reverse causality. If these associations are causal, facility delivery with postnatal check up could avoid about 1 / 3 of all neonatal deaths in India (~ 100, 000 /year) ...|$|R
