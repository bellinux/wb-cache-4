5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> {{around the}} {{platform}} is in a considerably preserved state as well, although parts of it have broken off. It is quite thickand was presumably constructed to protect the stupa from the sides. There is evidence that inner surface of the wall had been adorned with paintings. Its lower portion is covered by stone panels with carvings of a flower design. Below the wall, {{the side of the}} upper platform itself is decorated with carvings, as is the side of the lower platform.|$|E

5|$|An {{official}} {{video for}} the remix version produced by HarDrum was {{included on the}} CD format of the single; it included unreleased footage that did not appear on the original version, featuring different angle shots of the girls, expressions from the public's faces and the band performing erratically. It also included various scenes of people on-set helping with the music video's production, and one holding the wired fence. In July and September 2015, the group uploaded two teaser videos of a remix version produced by Fly Dream in order to commemorate the single's 15th anniversary on 19 December that same year; by then, it still remained unreleased. On 7 August 2016, one year since the two trailers, t.A.T.u. uploaded an HD version of the video with new unreleased scenes and extended footage. Lasting five minutes and 37 seconds, it showed an extended cut of the girls arguing next to <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> and walking {{around the corner to}} find the vast Khodynka Field with a clearer cityscape in the distance by the fourth minute. The ending of the video portrays t.A.T.u. in the distance, similar to the original video.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Harvard University, through straws, thus concealing the {{purchases}} from the neighborhood, bought the wood frame and brick houses along Francis, Fenwood, St. Alban's, Kempton Streets, {{and part of}} Huntington Avenue, and announced plans to demolish the buildings. Most were replaced with the Mission Park residential complex of towers and townhomes in 1978 after neighborhood residents organized the Roxbury Tenants of Harvard Association to convince Harvard to rebuild. The tower sits {{on the site of}} the House of the Good Shepard, once a large and prominent orphanage. The gates to the complex and <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> along Huntington survive from this era.|$|E
25|$|The crowned White Eagle, {{which is}} also used in the coat of arms of Poland, and the crown above the {{escutcheon}} symbolize the fact that Cracow was the Polish capital and seat of Polish kings from ca. 1040 until 1596. The coat of arms with <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall,</b> the three towers, the open gate and the eagle {{dates back to the}} 16th century. The actual colors and shapes, however, changed with time. The current design, adopted in 2002, uses shapes of the escutcheon and the eagle based on those found on Renaissance seals, signets and other artifacts, but other shapes, including Gothic and Neo-Classical, were also used in past. The Free City of Cracow, a city state which existed between 1815 and 1846 used the Cracow coat of arms as its state symbol. The Grand Duchy of Cracow created after the Free City's annexation by the Austrian Empire, used the White Eagle with the Cracow coat as an inescutcheon but without the eagle inside the gate.|$|E

25|$|For {{many of the}} {{hundreds}} of thousands of people who visit Graceland each year, the visit takes on a quasi-religious perspective. They may plan for years to journey to the home of the ‘King’ of rock and roll. On site, headphones narrate the salient events of Elvis’s life and introduce the relics that adorn the rooms and corridors. The rhetorical mode is hagiographic, celebrating the life of an extraordinary man, emphasizing his generosity, his kindness and good fellowship, how he was at once a poor boy who made good, an extraordinary musical talent, a sinner and substance abuser, and a religious man devoted to the Gospel and its music. At the meditation garden, containing Elvis’s grave, some visitors pray, kneel, or quietly sing one of Elvis’s favorite hymns. <b>The</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> that encloses the mansion's grounds is covered with graffiti that express an admiration for the singer as well as petitions for help and thanks for favors granted.|$|E
25|$|The paratroopers {{started going}} down the avenue and came under fire. They could not {{distinguish}} where the enemy fire was coming from. Yoffe's APC was hit by an RPG, killing four of his men and wounding him as well as others. The vehicles pulled over and the soldiers took cover in adjacent buildings, most of them entering Al-Arba'een Police Station, a two-story building surrounded by a tall brick wall. In a very brief firefight the paratroopers wounded two and captured eight policemen. Ten minutes later the second floor was cleared. Lieutenant David Amit, the ranking unwounded officer, organized the defenses of the fifty paratroopers inside. He posted men at windows and behind <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> {{in the front of}} the building to block the entrance. A room was used as an aid station. Five men positioned themselves on the roof an adjacent building and began firing on the surrounding Egyptians. The policemen launched two attempts to break into the police station and rescue those held inside. In one of the attempts, the Egyptians broke into the building from a side entrance and advanced toward the aid station, and the battalion doctor and his medics opened fire on them. Yoffe's leg had been badly ripped but he refused morphine in order to stay alert. When the Egyptian fire stopped, he told his men that the Egyptians were preparing for an attack. The building was then attacked by RPGs and grenades, and the second floor caught fire. Yoffe told the doctor to burn the maps and papers that might help the Egyptian intelligence. Having lost much blood, he kept losing consciousness. The fire was eventually doused and the attack repulsed. Both attempts failed had cost the Egyptians another eight policemen killed.|$|E

500|$|Britain's first {{roadside}} petrol {{filling station}} was opened by The AA on the Bath Road near Aldermaston on 2 March 1919. The following year, one villager requested that a pump be installed by his house. [...] "Chuffer" [...] Ford, {{who lived in}} The Forge with his wife Olive, was told by Keyser {{that it must be}} [...] "behind a wall and recessed". A hole was cut in <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> beside Ford's yard to house the Shell-branded pump. The location of this pump is marked by a square hole in the present wall. Ford's business offered other motoring services, with signage reading [...] "vacuum, oil, and cycles".|$|E
500|$|The {{circular}} lower {{platform is}} entered through a single entrance {{on the northern}} side. Four elaborately constructed doorways lead from it to the upper platform, which {{is surrounded by a}} brick wall on its edge. These entrances are oriented to the four cardinal directions. The center of this platform is occupied by the stupa, which has four Buddha statues seated around it, each facing one of the entrances. Each of these statues are [...] high, and are seated on stone seats with a height of [...] each. Three concentric rows of stone columns had existed on the upper platform. Two of these rows, of which nothing remain, were within <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall,</b> while the third row is just outside it. The inner row had consisted of 16 columns, the middle row of 20, and the outer row of 32. The existing stone columns of the outer ring are about [...] in height.|$|E
50|$|St Luke's Church {{was built}} in about 1430. Originally half-timbered, <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> <b>walls</b> {{encasing}} <b>the</b> nave and chancel are later additions. It was designated a Grade I listed building on 14 February 1967.|$|R

500|$|The album's title {{alludes to}} the doggy style sex {{position}} and is {{a reference to the}} musician's name. The artwork, which was done by artist Joe Cool, represents the themes covered in the album and the style of implementation of those ideas. Some critics believe the artwork portrays a woman merely as a hole to be filled by the man, which they believe adheres to the narcissistic and sexist lyrical themes Snoop Dogg covers. In this interpretation, the cover art and lyrics convey what they refer to as the self-indulgent [...] "gangsta" [...] lifestyle, drugs, cars, sex, and money. The artwork uses several quotes from the 1982 George Clinton single [...] "Atomic Dog". The quotes come from the dogs at the top of <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> on the album cover, which say, [...] "Why must I feel like dat?", [...] "Why must I chase da cat?" [...] and [...] "Nuttin' but da dogg in me".|$|E
500|$|The castle {{then passed}} to Isabella's grandson, Edward the Black Prince. Edward III had decreed in 1337 {{that his son}} would inherit the castle after Isabella's death, {{complete}} with the surrounding manor {{and the right to}} part of the tolls from King's Lynn, although these brought in only a relatively modest £100 a year. As part of this arrangement, the King declared the castle to be a permanent part of the Duchy of Cornwall, an estate traditionally assigned {{for the use of the}} Prince of Wales. The Prince undertook repairs to the castle during the 1360s, including spending £81 on repairing the [...] "Nightegale Tower" [...] in 1365, although it is uncertain which part of the castle this refers to. The Prince died in 1376, returning the Duchy of Cornwall to the control of the Crown, and during this time Castle Rising appears to have been maintained in good condition. [...] It was ordered on several occasions during the 1380s to raise local forces to counter the threat of a French invasion, and may have been equipped with two cannons. If not built by Isabella, <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> around the inner bailey may have been constructed during this period.|$|E
500|$|The cover photo {{features}} (from left to right) Johnny, Tommy, Joey and Dee Dee Ramone, {{staring at}} the camera with blank faces. They are all wearing ripped/faded blue jeans and leather jackets, standing upright against <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> of a private community garden called Albert's Garden, located in the Bowery neighborhood of New York City between Bowery Street and Second Street. The stance of the group members in the photograph would influence their future cover designs as well, {{with the majority of}} their succeeding albums using a picture of the band on the front cover. Music historian Legs McNeil states that [...] "Tommy [...] standing on his tip-toes and Joey [...] hunched over a bit." [...] The back cover art, which depicts a belt buckle with a bald eagle and the band's logo, was designed by Arturo Vega. Liner notes on the back cover fail to acknowledge backing vocalists and additional instrument players. Leigh, who performed backing vocals on several tracks, asked guitarist Johnny why he was not mentioned on the record's credits. Johnny replied: [...] "We didn't want people to get confused with who's in the band or who's not. It's our first album, you know, and we didn't want people to get confused." ...|$|E

When asked about <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> comment, Bryant said, [...] "I knew {{there was a lot of}} talk about <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> and all that.
