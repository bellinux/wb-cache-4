40|$|This study {{investigated}} relationships among and between psychological hardiness, coping style, and burnout in 101 female hospital nurses. The third generation (50 -item) hardiness scale, scored by the revised scoring procedure, {{was used to}} measure hardiness and its components. The Maslach Burnout Inventory was used as the measurement for burnout. Coping style was assessed by the COPE Inventory. The components of hardiness, commitment, control, and challenge, were hypothesized to be negative predictors of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and positive predictors of personal accomplishment. In addition, hardiness and its components were postulated to be positively related <b>to</b> adaptive <b>coping</b> styles and negatively related <b>to</b> maladaptive <b>coping</b> styles. Emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were thought to be related positively <b>to</b> maladaptive <b>coping</b> styles and negatively related <b>to</b> adaptive <b>coping</b> styles. Personal accomplishment was thought to be positively related <b>to</b> adaptive <b>coping</b> style and negatively related <b>to</b> maladaptive <b>coping</b> style.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{investigated}} how humor in general, but not specific humor styles in particular, is related <b>to</b> different <b>coping</b> styles. In the present study, 256 adults {{were asked to}} rate the funniness of 24 written jokes selected by the authors as representative of sick humor (humor on death, disgusting jokes, and jokes on disabled persons) and neutral, non-sick humor. In addition, they completed the Brief COPE Inventory (Carver 1997) and a religiosity index. Appreciation of sick humor was positively related <b>to</b> <b>coping</b> styles reflecting emotional expression and to use of humor as coping, and negatively related to religion measures. Appreciation of neutral humor was positively related <b>to</b> <b>coping</b> styles reflecting active coping and positivity in reframing. Although religiosity seemed to share with humor the latter coping styles, it differed in that it was negatively related <b>to</b> emotional expression <b>coping</b> styles and self-distraction, the latter style being typical of all humor indicators of the study.

Twenty-seven mothers of children diagnosed with cancer completed several measures of religious beliefs and behaviors as well as the Beck Depression Inventory–II.

Three different military samples were studied (officer cadets, special infantry and Marine corps recruits, and recruits).

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} growth of leisure coping research, {{it is not}} entirely clear what types of leisure best {{contribute}} <b>to</b> <b>coping</b> with stress, and how the processes that link specific activities <b>to</b> <b>coping</b> outcomes operate. Also, researchers have tended <b>to</b> examine leisure <b>coping</b> independent of general coping (i. e., coping not directly associated with leisure such as problem-focused <b>coping).</b> <b>To</b> help overcome these limitations, {{the purpose of the}} present study was to test two models of leisure and coping: (a) an independent model and (b) a buffer model. The study focused on the impact of participation in major types of leisure activity when the effects of general coping were taken into account. Specifically, examined were the effects of both leisure behavior and experience (i. e., frequency and enjoyment of leisure participation) on the adaptational outcomes of stress-coping. The two models of leisure and coping suggest that the mechanisms by which leisure contributes <b>to</b> <b>coping</b> are somewhat different. An independent model assumes that although the presence of stressors is detrimental to health, leisure safeguards against ill-health and promotes positive adaptational outcomes (e. g., well-being), irrespective of the presence or levels of the stressors encountered (Ensel & Lin, 1991). For example, those individuals who actively participate in leisure are assumed to gain greater health benefits than those who do not no matter how stressful or non-stressful their lives are. A buffer model suggests that leisure acts as a "buffer " against the experience of stress and helps maintain good health and produce positive adaptational outcomes (e. g., stress reduction). For example...|$|R
