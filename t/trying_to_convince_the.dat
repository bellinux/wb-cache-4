Meanwhile, sales rep Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) finds methods to undermine his cube-mate, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson); receptionist Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) tries to deal with Michael's insensitivities and flubs; and temporary employee Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) is acting mostly as an observer of the insanity around him.|$|E
5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas spent 50 {{years of}} his life {{actively}} fighting slavery and the violent colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization. Unlike the other priests who sought to destroy all of the indigenous peoples native books and writings, he was strictly opposed to this action. Although he failed to save the indigenous peoples of the Western Indies, his efforts resulted in several improvements in the legal status of the natives, and in an increased colonial focus on the ethics of colonialism. Las Casas is often seen {{as one of the first}} advocates for universal conception of human dignity (later human rights).|$|E
25|$|Administration {{officials}} have long accused Iran of supporting Shiite militias in attacks on American forces in Iraq. The difference {{now is that}} administration officials are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> Iraqi government that Iran {{may not be the}} ally it thought, and is behind attacks against Iraqi government forces. That is a harder sell, given that Iran has supported Iraq’s government.|$|E

25|$|Sally Roesch Wagner of The Matilda Joslyn Gage Foundation has {{published}} a pamphlet titled The Wonderful Mother of Oz describing how Matilda Gage's feminist politics were sympathetically channeled by Baum into his Oz books. Much of the politics in the Republican Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer dealt with <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> populace to vote for women's suffrage. Baum was the secretary of Aberdeen's Woman's Suffrage Club. Susan B. Anthony visited Aberdeen and stayed with the Baums. Nancy Tystad Koupal notes an apparent loss of interest in editorializing after Aberdeen failed to pass the bill for women's enfranchisement.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1760s, {{a survey}} team divided the Island into 67 lots. On July 1, 1767, these {{properties}} were allocated to supporters of King George III {{by means of}} a lottery. Ownership of the land remained in the hands of landlords in England, angering Island settlers who were unable to gain title to land on which they worked and lived. Significant rent charges (to absentee landlords) created further anger. The land had been given to the absentee landlords with a number of conditions attached regarding upkeep and settlement terms; many of these conditions were not satisfied. Islanders spent decades <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> Crown to confiscate the lots, however the descendants of the original owners were generally well connected to the British government and refused to give up the land.|$|E

25|$|Georges Cuvier is {{credited}} with establishing the modern conception of extinction in a 1796 lecture to the French Institute, though he would spend {{most of his career}} <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> wider scientific community of his theory. Cuvier was a well-regarded geologist, lauded for his ability to reconstruct the anatomy of an unknown species from a few fragments of bone. His primary evidence for extinction came from mammoth skulls found in the Paris basin. Cuvier recognized them as distinct from any known living species of elephant, and argued that it was highly unlikely such an enormous animal would go undiscovered. In 1812, Cuvier, along with Alexandre Bronigniart & Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, mapped the strata of the Paris basin. They saw alternating saltwater and freshwater deposits, as well as patterns of the appearance and disappearance of fossils throughout the record. From these patterns, Cuvier inferred historic cycles of catastrophic flooding, extinction, and repopulation of the earth with new species.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, matters {{had come}} to a head. The Pope had refused to confirm Louis's {{favourite}} candidate for the bishopric of Cologne, William Egon of Fürstenberg. Enraged, the French king decided to execute a lightning campaign into Germany before the emperor could shift his troops to the West. Louis also hoped to keep his Turkish ally in the war this way. For the immediate future James had to hold his own, something Louis expected him to be quite capable of, especially if the Dutch were intimidated. On 9 September (Gregorian calendar) the French envoy Jean Antoine de Mesmes, the Comte d'Avaux, handed two letters from the French king, who had known of the invasion plans since May, to the States General of the Netherlands. In the first they were warned not to attack James. In the second they were advised not to interfere with the French policy in Germany. James hurriedly distanced himself from the first message, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> States General that there was no secret Anglo-French alliance against them. This however, had precisely the opposite effect: many members became extremely suspicious. The second message proved that the main French effort was directed to the east, not the north, so there was no immediate danger of a French invasion for the Republic itself.|$|E
25|$|The end of 1912 saw {{the end of}} a year of {{political}} struggle for Law. As well as the problem of Home Rule, there were internal party struggles; supporters of the Church of England or military reform lambasted Law for not paying attention to their causes, and tariff reformers argued with him over his previous compromise on food duties. Despite this, most Conservatives realised that as a fighting leader, Law could not be bettered. The results of by-elections throughout 1913 continued to favour them, but progress on the Home Rule Bill was less encouraging; on 7 July it was again passed by the Commons, and again rejected by the Lords on 15 July. Parliament rose for the summer recess on 15 August, and Law and the Unionists spent the summer <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> King to voice an opinion on the issue. Their first suggestion was that he should withhold the Royal Assent on it, something that horrified Law's constitutional law adviser A.V. Dicey. The second was more reasonable– they argued that the Liberals had put the King in an impossible position by asking him to ratify a bill that would infuriate half of the population. His only option was to write a memo to Asquith saying this and requesting that the problem of home rule be put to the electorate via a general election. After thinking on this, the King agreed, and handed a note to Asquith on 11 August requesting either an election or an all-party conference.|$|E

[...] A source from the MTA commented that no subway stations in the MTA system are named or co-named after individuals, mostly because it could confuse riders.

500|$|In January 1966, Cooper {{accompanied}} Secretary of State Rusk and Ambassador W.

This visit, along with visits to South Vietnam in December 1965 and January 1966, reinforced Cooper's opposition to military operations in Southeast Asia. In a meeting with President Johnson on January 26, 1966, he again urged the president to forgo his announced intentions to resume bombing missions in North Vietnam and negotiate a settlement instead. Johnson was noncommittal, and that afternoon, Cooper returned to the Senate floor, urgently <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> legislators that negotiation was preferable to escalation, even when it meant negotiating with the Viet Cong fighters in South Vietnam, which he believed was necessary to achieve peace. Cooper advocated a three-to-five-year cease fire, enforced by the United Nations, followed by national elections as prescribed by the 1954 Geneva Convention. Ultimately, Johnson did not heed Cooper's plea and resumed U.S. bombing missions in North Vietnam.|$|E
500|$|Skaaren's {{first draft}} {{retained}} {{some of the}} more sinister characteristics of McDowell's Betelgeuse, but toned down the character to make him a troublesome pervert rather than blatantly murderous. Betelgeuse's true form was that of the Middle Eastern man, and much of his dialogue was written in African American Vernacular English. This version concluded with the Deetzes returning to New York and leaving Lydia in the care of the Maitlands, who, with Lydia's help, transform the exterior of their home into a stereotypical haunted house while returning the interior to its previous state. [...] It also would have featured deleted scenes such as the real-estate agent, Jane, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> Deetzes to allow her to sell the house for them (having sold it to them in the first place—Charles and Delia decline), and a reveal on how Beetlejuice had died centuries earlier (that he'd attempted to hang himself while drunk, only to mess it up and died slowly choking to death, rather than quickly by snapping his neck) and wound-up working for Juno before striking it out on his own as a [...] "free-lance Bio-Exorcist".|$|E
