5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little {{had been changed}} since the 17th century in terms of legal {{education}} or practice, except <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>were</b> no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call to the Bar was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had been called to the Bar at the Inn transferred to others.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the public}} commented that {{although}} some events were sold out, {{there appeared to be}} many unoccupied seats at venues, and claimed that this was because the Ministry of Education (MOE) made a block purchase of 87,000 passes to be given to schools. However, students usually did not stay for the full duration of sessions, which can be up to seven hours long. The MOE denied <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>were</b> to blame, stating that more than 95% of students allocated tickets had attended events, and that some schools had asked to purchase additional tickets due to overwhelming demand. The SYOGOC announced that once sessions had begun, unoccupied seats would be resold to people who turned up in person at venues. To enable venue managers to gauge the number of seats available for resale, teachers escorting students to events were instructed to inform venue managers if they intended to leave before sessions ended and the number of seats occupied by students. On 20 August, the organisers reported that tickets were sold out for all 26 sports except girls' football.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First English Civil War led to a complete suspension of legal education, and from November 1642 until July 1644 no Pension meetings were held. Only 43 students were admitted during the four years of the war, and none were called to the Bar. Meetings of Pension resumed after the Battle of Marston Moor but the education system remained dormant. Although Readers were appointed, none read, and no moots were held. In 1646, {{after the end of}} the war, there was an attempt to restore the old system of readings and moots, and in 1647 an order was made <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>were</b> required to moot at least once a day. This failed to work, with Readers refusing to read, and the old system of legal education completely died out.|$|E

Meyer, appeared on the Fox News show The Big Story with John Gibson, where he debated Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education. There Meyer sought to convey the Institute's message that debate over evolution is not a ploy to get religious ideas into public schools, that evolution is a theory in crisis, and <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>were</b> currently being taught in error there was no scientific controversy over evolution.|$|E
25|$|From 1878 until 1883 {{he studied}} at the Pontificia Accademia dei Nobili Ecclesiastici in Rome.

Cardinal Mariano Rampolla took note of him and furthered his entry in the diplomatic service of the Vatican in 1882, where he was employed by Rampolla as a secretary and soon to be posted to Madrid. When Rampolla subsequently was appointed Cardinal Secretary of State, della Chiesa followed him. During these years, della Chiesa helped negotiate the resolution of a dispute between Germany and Spain over the Caroline Islands as well as organising relief during a cholera epidemic.|$|E

25|$|The re-emergence of Botany in {{the medieval}} world came about during the sixteenth century. As part of the revival of {{classical}} medicine, {{one of the biggest}} areas of interest was materia medica: the study of remedial substances. “Italian humanists in the fifteenth century had recovered and translated ancient Greek botanical texts which had been unknown in the West in the Middle Ages or relatively ignored”. Soon after the rise in interest in botany, universities such as Padua and Bologna started to create programs and fields of study; some of these practices including setting up gardens so <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>were</b> able to collect and examine plants. “Botany was also a field in which printing made a tremendous impact, through the development of naturalistic illustrated herbals”. During this time period, university practices were highly concerned with the philosophical matters of study in sciences and the liberal arts, “but by the sixteenth century both scholastic discussion of plants and reliance upon intermediary compendia for plant names and descriptions were increasingly abandoned in favor of direct study of the original texts of classical authors and efforts to reconcile names, descriptions, and plants in nature”. Botanist expanded their knowledge of different plant remedies, seeds, bulbs, uses of dried and living plants through continuous interchange made possible by printing. In sixteenth century medicine, botany was rapidly becoming a lively and fast-moving discipline that held wide universal appeal in the world of doctors, philosophers, and pharmacists.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} school trained cadets {{for various}} periods, 3 years {{for those who}} were not proficient in French, 2 years {{for those who were}} proficient in French and one year for Non-Commissioned Officer’s. At the end of the training period, they graduate and get promoted to lieutenant rank according to a degree. During the graduation ceremony which is often chaired by the Syrian prime minister, the graduating officers are given Platoon commander certificate each in his own specialty (Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, Engineering) and a certificate of competence for the rank of lieutenant. After the graduation, the officers are assigned to different army units where they establish the necessary departments and units in order to train, habilitate and lead. On August 15, 1945, the school barracks were handed over to the Syrian authorities and the Lebanese and French units moved to Lebanon. Instructors and students joined the Kobbeh barracks in Tripoli and they were put administratively under the authority of the third battalion’s company located there. After <b>that,</b> <b>students</b> <b>were</b> given a 15 days leave and joined a camp in Kousba. On September 25, the school moved to St. Anthony convent in Baabda, and settled there for about a year. On October 14, 1946, the school moved to Shikri Ghanem base, the buildings consisted of barracks that were used by the British before they left Lebanon and the school remained in this location till now. On December 31, 1951, the Lebanese president Bechara El Khoury inaugurated the school's new buildings.|$|E
500|$|Bird {{was quick}} to defend the virtuousness of students. [...] In November 1853, in a reply to {{a letter from a}} student in the Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal {{complaining}} of a lack of moral care from his superiors, Bird attacked the prevalent public view <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>were</b> [...] "guilty of every kind of open vice and moral depravity". [...] Bird laid much of the blame for this public opinion on the caricatures of students in the writings of Charles Dickens. [...] He {{went on to say that}} the behaviour and character of students had greatly improved over the preceding ten years. [...] He attributed this improvement in part to the greatly increased study requirements imposed on students, but also in part to Christian influences acting on them. [...] He also commented that pious students had once been ridiculed, but were now respected.|$|E

30|$|Davis (1993) {{points out}} that the user {{acceptance}} of a new information system, such as online learning is considered the essential factor that determines {{the success or failure of}} the system. In fact, in addition to this study, a vast host of relative studies show <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> not naturally ready for e-learning. Piskurich (2003) holds that there are various reasons behind individuals’ failure in e-learning environments and often the reason of the failure <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> not ready for it. Taher Farahat (2012) finds out that although the investment in large number of financial resources and the intensive efforts to implement online learning resulted in quantitative growth of e-courses that become online available, the <b>students</b> <b>are</b> reluctant to practice online learning. Hao (2016) also agrees <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> not prepared for flipped learning.|$|R
500|$|From 1976 to 1979, {{the group}} lived in campgrounds, {{usually in the}} Rocky Mountains or Texas. Applewhite and Nettles began to place greater demands on their followers' {{heretofore}} loosely structured lives, which improved membership retention. They typically communicated with their disciples in writing or through assistants. Increasingly, they emphasized {{that they were the}} only source of truth—the idea that members could receive individual revelations was rejected in an attempt to prevent schisms. Applewhite also sought to prevent close friendships among his followers, fearing that this could lead to insubordination. Applewhite and Nettles insisted that their followers practice what they referred to as [...] "flexibility": strict obedience to their often shifting requests. The two leaders limited the group's contacts with those outside the movement, even some who may have been interested in joining, ostensibly to prevent infiltration from hostile parties. In practice, this made their followers completely dependent upon them. Applewhite instructed his disciples to be like children or pets in their submission—their sole responsibility was to obey their leaders. Members were encouraged to constantly seek Applewhite's advice and often ask themselves what their leaders would do when making a decision. To his followers, he did not seem dictatorial: many of them found him laid back and fatherly. In his 2000 study of the group, Winston Davis states that Applewhite mastered the [...] "fine art of religious entertainment", noting that many of his disciples seemed to enjoy their service. Applewhite organized seemingly arbitrary rituals that were intended to instill a sense of discipline in his followers; he referred to these tasks as [...] "games". He also watched science-fiction television programs {{with the rest of the}} group. Rather than issue direct commands, he attempted to express his preferences and nominally offer his disciples a choice. He emphasized <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>were</b> free to disobey if they chose, in what Lalich dubs the [...] "illusion of choice".|$|E
2500|$|The Board of Education reacted by banning all but [...] "polite dances" [...] {{on school}} premises.

2500|$|For many years, {{students}} would throw marshmallows at the kick-off of football games. Northwestern archivist Patrick Quinn says <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>were</b> likely [...] "trying {{to get them}} into the tubas, and then started throwing them at each other", leading to the tradition of throwing marshmallows at the field. While Gary Barnett was football coach, he banned marshmallows because they supposedly detracted from the serious level of football that he wanted for the school.|$|E

[...] The video claims that the shootings at Virginia Tech and Columbine, among others, are in part the result of: decreased discipline in schools; no prayer in schools; sex out of wedlock; rampant violence in TV, movies, and music; or abortions.|$|E

2500|$|While {{some claim}} that phone text {{messaging}} {{is the primary}} cause of character amnesia, the phenomenon, at least in Japan, appears to originate with widespread use of word processors. An article in the Asahi Shimbun from 23 September 1985, reports <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>were</b> finding it increasingly difficult to remember how to write even quite simple kanji by hand since the full-scale introduction of word processors at a university campus in Isehara. A 1993 survey of members of the Information Processing Society of Japan found that habitual word processor users reported declining ability to write characters by hand. The Japanese term [...] describes a person whose handwriting ability has deteriorated due to overreliance on computer input methods.|$|E
2500|$|Caldwell also {{removed the}} {{controversial}} Youth News Network from Manitoba schools. [...] The network's parent company, Athena Education Partners, had previously offered free technology to schools {{in return for}} requiring students to watch daily YNN broadcasts, which included commercials from private corporations. [...] According to Todd Scarth of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, YNN televisions were equipped with two-way monitoring systems to ensure <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>were</b> watching and that the volume was not adjusted. [...] Athena's contracts also required schools to hire a half-day technician to maintain YNN equipment. [...] Caldwell described YNN's programming as [...] "clearly an unsatisfactory curriculum choice" [...] for children, and oversaw the program's elimination once previously-signed contracts were concluded in August 2000. [...] The network was also banned in other provinces, and went off the air in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Safford School District, {{like many}} school districts, has a policy {{strictly}} prohibiting the use, possession, or sale of any drug on school grounds, including prescription drugs, without advanced administrative permission.

[...] On the day of Savana’s search, the same student turned a white pill over to Mr. Wilson. [...] The pill was later identified {{as a form of}} prescription ibuprofen.
