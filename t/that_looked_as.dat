25|$|Albus Dumbledore {{was tall}} and thin, with silver hair and beard (auburn in his youth) so long {{that they could be}} tucked into his belt. He had a very long and crooked nose <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> if it had been broken at least twice. (It is speculated that his brother's punch during their sister's funeral may {{have played a role in}} shaping his nose.) He was also said to have had long and {{skillful}} fingers. His eyes were described to be a brilliant, soul-piercing shade of blue, and usually twinkled with kindness and mischief.|$|E
25|$|Tina Louise is Ginger Grant, {{the movie}} star. Louise clashed with {{producer}} Sherwood Schwartz because {{she believed that}} she was hired as the central character. Her character was originally written as a hard-nosed, sharp-tongued temptress, but Louise argued that this portrayal was too harsh and refused to play it as written. A compromise was reached; Louise agreed to play her as a Marilyn Monroe/Jayne Mansfield type. Louise continued to clash with producers over her role and was the only cast member who refused to return {{for any of the}} post-series TV movies, saying that the role had killed her career as a serious actress. She did, however, appear in a reunion of the cast on a late-night television talk show in 1988 and on an episode of Roseanne in 1995 when the Roseanne cast re-enacted Gilligan's Island. In the first season, Ginger often wore gowns <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> if they were tailored from Minnow tarpaulins or similar substitute cloth (some had the name of the vessel stenciled on them). In the pilot episode, the character of Ginger, no last name, (then a secretary) was played by actress Kit Smythe.|$|E
500|$|Some special effects, like Motoko's [...] "thermo-optical camouflage", were {{rendered}} {{through the}} use of TIMA software. The process uses a single illustration and manipulates the image as necessary to produce distortions for effect in combination with a background without altering the original illustration. The effect is re-added back into the shot to complete the scene. While the visual displays used in the film were technically simple to create, the appearance of the displays underwent numerous revisions by the production team to best represent visual displays of the future. Another aspect of the CG use was to create images and effects <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> if they were [...] "perceived by the brain" [...] and were generated in video and added to the film in its final stages.|$|E

2500|$|... "There was a National Park out there, but I can't {{remember}} {{exactly where it}} was [...] [...] [...] at least, it wasn't of substantial significance {{in the scheme of}} things. The thing that was significant was that we had to double the output of power in this state in ten years in order [...] supply the demands of industry and the community. And this was the scheme <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> though it could do a greater part of [...] job for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first 63 {{issues of}} Animal Man {{featuring}} Bolland's artwork covered the tenures of writers Grant Morrison, Peter Milligan, Tom Veitch and Jamie Delano, with Bolland's images maintaining a continuity {{of style and}} imagery while the interior work underwent several changes of style and storyline. Initially, he recalls that his cover images derived directly from the script. He would [...] "go through and find a scene <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> if {{it would make a}} good cover," [...] or [...] "find a particular hook that cleverly summed up what's going on inside the book." [...] This included the incorporation of photographs into the later covers of Morrison's tale of metafiction and deus ex machina author-input. With the (post-Morrison) move of Animal Man to DC's new 'Mature Readers' imprint Vertigo, Bolland notes that the covers moved to [...] "full color painted covers" [...] with issue No. 57. These of his covers were [...] "a mixture of ink linework, color washes, airbrush and then, eventually, areas painted in poster color by my wife, Rachel," [...] which ultimately saw her have significant input on some covers, with Bolland acknowledging that [...] "some of the last Animal Man covers were more her than me." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "After the {{two parts}} which I have already explained, at the left of Our Lady and a little above, we saw an Angel with a flaming sword in his left hand; flashing, it gave out flames <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> though they would set the world on fire; but they died out {{in contact with the}} splendour that Our Lady {{radiated}} towards him from her right hand: pointing to the earth with his right hand, the Angel cried out in a loud voice: 'Penance, Penance, Penance!' And we saw in an immense light that is God: 'something similar to how people appear in a mirror when they pass in front of it' a Bishop dressed in White 'we had the impression that it was the Holy Father'. Other Bishops, Priests, Religious men and women going up a steep mountain, at the top of which there was a big Cross of rough-hewn trunks as of a cork-tree with the bark; before reaching there the Holy Father passed through a big city half in ruins and half trembling with halting step, afflicted with pain and sorrow, he prayed for the souls of the corpses he met on his way; having {{reached the top of the}} mountain, on his knees at the foot of the big Cross he was killed by a group of soldiers who fired bullets and arrows at him, and in the same way there died one after another the other Bishops, Priests, Religious men and women, and various lay people of different ranks and positions. Beneath the two arms of the Cross there were two Angels each with a crystal aspersorium in his hand, in which they gathered up the blood of the Martyrs and with it sprinkled the souls that were making their way to God." ...|$|E

60|$|Will pursed up {{his smooth}} sensuous face <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> {{if it had}} never needed shaving. Lettie went out with Marie, hearing the bell ring.|$|E

60|$|At length, on {{the very}} crest of the high, smooth hill, they alighted and Fred led the way toward a rusty old hack <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> much out of place on that wind-swept point as a Chinese pagoda.|$|E

60|$|The boy went, and re-appeared {{five minutes}} afterwards, {{struggling}} with an antediluvian chunk of wood, <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> {{though it had}} been recently dug out of somewhere, and dug out carelessly, so as to have been unnecessarily damaged in the process.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I can," [...] said Jeff; and in {{a minute}} or two they stood before the matronizing hostess, after a passage through the {{babbling}} and laughing groups <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> impossible after they had made it as it looked before.|$|E
6000|$|True, he hadn't {{thought of}} that. He had no cards. He {{received}} {{one from the}} clerk <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> if it had done duty before, and scrawled his name upon it, {{and gave it to}} the insolent little darky who served as [...] "Front." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Prink half an hour, {{and put on}} her wad," [...] {{answered}} the irreverent Tom, whose preparations for school consisted in flinging his cap on to his head, and strapping up several big books, <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> if they were sometimes used as weapons of defence.|$|E
60|$|Five {{minutes more}} found them {{again on the}} way, and now Songbird had the large lights turned on, which made the roadway ahead as bright as day.

60|$|They had now {{to advance}} with more caution than ever, and {{several days later}} came to some open water <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> if it would bar all further progress. The lead was six or seven hundred feet wide, and ran east and west as far as eye could reach.|$|E

6000|$|... "Where is this outlet?" [...] asked Deerslayer; [...] "I see no {{opening in}} the banks or the trees, <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> if it would let a river like the Susquehannah run through it." ...|$|R
60|$|This time we whistled {{and roared}} till the steam gave out, {{and the answer}} nearly {{deafened}} us.

60|$|It {{seems that}} they had luncheon somewhere together. She {{did not take the}} trouble to inquire where she was: an old-fashioned hotel somewhere in Kensington, with table-cloths <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> if they had been used for several {{previous}} luncheons, and foreign waiters who wore weird-looking shoes and trousers frayed at the edges.|$|E
6000|$|... “I know this: Less than an {{hour ago}} we met two fellows on the river, one with a hamper {{and the other with}} a bundle <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> if it was done up in an {{overcoat}} turned inside out.
