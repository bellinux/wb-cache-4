At one point Mackenzie threatened to sue. However, Mackenzie did love islands and would graduate from Herm to the Hebrides.|$|E

5|$|Microgale macpheei is an extinct shrew tenrec from southeastern Madagascar. It {{is known}} only from two partial skulls found in Andrahomana cave, which {{radiocarbon}} dating of associated rodent remains suggests are about 2000 years old. It {{is the only}} known recently extinct tenrec. First described in 2007, it is most similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> Microgale brevicaudata of northern and western Madagascar. M.macpheei has a broad rostrum (front part of the skull) and, like M.brevicaudata, lacks a diastema (gap) between the premolars. A number of details of tooth morphology are characteristic of M.macpheei.|$|E

40|$|A {{report of}} {{alveolar}} soft part sarcoma metastatic <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> bowel is presented. Hematogenous metastases <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> bowel from primary tumors outside the abdominal cavity are uncommon, and most remain asymptomatic {{and are not}} discovered until autopsy. However, small bowel metastases can lead to intestinal obstruction, intussuseption or even perforation. While metastases <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> bowel have been described for other tumor types, including melanoma and lung cancer, this is extremely uncommon for sarcoma, especially alveolar soft part sarcoma. We describe a 42 -year-old male {{with a long history}} of alveolar soft part sarcoma, metastatic <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lung and brain, who developed an intussuseption from metastases <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> bowel...|$|R
30|$|Gastric cancer {{metastasis}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine is very rare, {{and almost all}} metastases <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine are direct invasions or disseminations, making lymphatic or hematogenous metastases especially rare (9.1 % of metastatic tumors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine) [16]. In this case, the tumor in <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine was considered a hematogenous metastasis of the gastric cancer because (1) this tumor was histologically {{the same as the}} gastric cancer, (2) there was no peritoneal dissemination, and (3) hematogenous spread is more typical and often includes the adrenal gland, liver, and bone.|$|R
5|$|One inefficient {{approach}} {{to finding the}} GCD of two natural numbers a and b is to calculate all their common divisors; the GCD is then the largest common divisor. The common divisors can be found by dividing both numbers by successive integers from 2 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> number b. The number of steps of this approach grows linearly with b, or exponentially {{in the number of}} digits. Another inefficient approach is to find the prime factors of one or both numbers. As noted above, the GCD equals the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers a and b. Present methods for prime factorization are also inefficient; many modern cryptography systems even rely on that inefficiency.|$|E

Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it {{difficult}} to find enough food to feed his people, who were starving and exhausted. Sitting Bull’s presence in the country led to increased tensions between the Canadian and the United States governments. Before Sitting Bull left Canada, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a memento.|$|E
5|$|The Martin AM Mauler (originally XBTM) was a single-seat {{shipboard}} attack aircraft {{built for}} the United States Navy. Designed during World War II, the Mauler encountered development delays and did not enter service until 1948 in small numbers. The aircraft proved troublesome and remained in frontline service only until 1950, when the Navy switched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> and simpler Douglas AD Skyraider. Maulers remained in reserve squadrons until 1953. A few were built as AM-1Q electronic-warfare aircraft with an additional crewman in the fuselage.|$|E

This was down from the previous year's attendance of 18,065, but the decline could be attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> size of the venue for WrestleMania XI. The attendance figure was also lower than the following year's figure of 18,852 fans at WrestleMania XII. The pay-per-view buyrate for WrestleMania XI was 1.3, which was lower than the 1.68 buyrate for WrestleMania X but higher than the 1.2 buyrate for WrestleMania XII.|$|E

During the second day (August 1) Hannibal, aware that Varro would be in command the following day, left his camp and offered battle, but Paullus refused. When his request was rejected, Hannibal, recognizing the importance {{of water from the}} Aufidus to the Roman troops, sent his cavalry <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> Roman camp to harass water-bearing soldiers that were found outside the camp fortifications.

5|$|All lemurs, {{particularly}} the smaller species, {{are affected by}} predation and they are important prey items for predators. Humans are the most significant predator of diurnal lemurs, despite taboos that occasionally forbid the hunting and eating of certain lemur species. Other predators include native euplerids, such as the fossa, feral cats, domestic dogs, snakes, diurnal birds of prey, owls, and crocodiles. Extinct giant eagles, including one or two species from the genus Aquila and the giant Malagasy crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus mahery), {{as well as the}} giant fossa (Cryptoprocta spelea), previously also preyed on lemurs, perhaps including the giant subfossil lemurs or their subadult offspring. The existence of these extinct giants suggests that predator-prey interactions involving lemurs were more complex than they are today. Today, predator size only restricts owls <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> lemurs, usually 100g (3.5oz) or less, while the larger lemurs fall victim to the larger diurnal birds of prey, such as the Madagascan harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) and the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus).|$|E
5|$|Alonso quickly progressed {{through the}} youth ranks and the reserve team at Real Sociedad (winning the regionalised fourth tier in his single {{season with the}} latter) and {{impressed}} enough to earn a first team debut {{at the age of}} 18. He made his first senior appearance against Logroñés in December 1999 in a Copa del Rey match. Alonso failed to make another appearance in the season but the following year brought more opportunities. At the beginning of the 2000–01 season, Javier Clemente sent him to Segunda División team Eibar to gain experience. Alonso's father particularly felt the move <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> club improved him as a player. A quick turnover of managers, however, including a two-month period with Periko Alonso in charge, left Real Sociedad in a dire situation. By January 2001, Real Sociedad were bottom of the league and its new manager, John Toshack, turned to the prodigious Alonso in the hope of reversing the team's fortunes. In a surprise move, the Welsh manager made the 20-year-old the team captain, a position traditionally held by more senior players. By the end of the season, Sociedad had climbed out of the relegation zone and finished in 14th place. Toshack lauded Alonso, noting that the impression he had on the team was exceptional, especially for a player from the youth team.|$|E

5|$|Dorset hosts {{a number}} of annual festivals, fairs and events {{including}} the Great Dorset Steam Fair near Blandford, {{one of the largest}} events of its kind in Europe, and the Bournemouth Air Festival, a free air show that attracted 1.3million visitors in 2009. The Spirit of the Seas is a maritime festival held in Weymouth and Portland. Launched in 2008, the festival features sporting activities, cultural events and local entertainers. The Dorset County Show, which was first held in 1841, is a celebration of Dorset's agriculture. The two-day event exhibits local produce and livestock and attracts some 55,000 people. Inside Out Dorset is an outdoor arts festival produced by Dorchester-based Activate Performing Arts that takes place every two years in rural and urban locations across Dorset. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> folk festivals held in towns such as Christchurch and Wimborne, Dorset holds several larger musical events such as Camp Bestival, Endorse It in Dorset, End of the Road and the Larmer Tree Festival.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{studies are}} {{necessarily}} holistic {{as opposed to}} reductionistic. Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations {{without reference to the}} whole system, which leads to 3) a metaphysical hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> parts. Scientific holism differs from mysticism that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the biomolecular properties of the exterior shells.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{participated in}} the Rangers' {{training}} camp that preceded the 2013–14 season, during which he impressed New York's head coach Alain Vigneault, and head European scout Anders Hedberg. Although {{it was his first}} North American professional training camp, Fast made the Rangers roster, partially because the team needed a right-handed shot to replace the injured captain Ryan Callahan. Fast made his NHL debut on October 3 against the Phoenix Coyotes, taking one shot on goal in 10:13 of ice time. Fast played in eight of the Rangers' first 10 games of the season, playing on the fourth line and recording no points and a -5 plus-minus, before returning to the AHL to make room for Carl Hagelin's return from a shoulder injury. Observers said Fast needed to adjust <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> North American ice surface, and did not get sufficient minutes to do so quickly enough to remain in the NHL.|$|E
