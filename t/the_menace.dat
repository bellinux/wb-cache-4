5|$|Farmers use live {{electric}} wires to guard their farms, which kills other animals as well. Farmers in Neemuch (Madhya Pradesh) {{went on a}} hunger strike in 2015 demanding {{compensation for the damage}} caused by nilgai. Although blackbuck cause a similar problem, the damage caused by them is significantly lower as they merely break off young shoots. A 1990 study suggested culling, building enclosures for the antelopes and fencing off agricultural areas as remedies for <b>the</b> <b>menace.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Jaws {{is limited by}} how the humans respond to the shark menace. The fish is given much detail, with {{descriptions}} of its anatomy and presence creating the sense of an unstoppable threat. Elevating <b>the</b> <b>menace</b> are violent descriptions of the shark attacks. Along with a carnivorous killer on the sea, Amity is populated with equally predatory humans: the mayor has ties with the mafia, an adulterous housewife, criminals among the tourists.|$|E
5|$|Harding's general {{election}} opponent was Ohio Attorney General Timothy Hogan, who {{had risen to}} statewide office despite widespread prejudice against Roman Catholics in rural areas. In 1914, the start of World War I {{and the prospect of}} a Catholic senator from Ohio increased nativist sentiment. Propaganda sheets with names like <b>The</b> <b>Menace</b> and The Defender contained warnings that Hogan was the vanguard in a plot led by Pope Benedict XV through the Knights of Columbus to control Ohio. Harding did not attack Hogan (an old friend) on this or most other issues, but he did not denounce the nativist hatred for his opponent.|$|E
5|$|Arulpragasam befriended {{students}} in the college's fashion, advertising and graphics departments. She met Justine Frischmann, front woman of the British band Elastica, through her friend Damon Albarn at an Air concert in 1999, and Frischmann commissioned Arulpragasama to create the cover art for the band's 2000 album, <b>The</b> <b>Menace,</b> and video document their American tour. Arulpragasam returned to Jaffna in 2001 to film a documentary on Tamil youth, {{but was unable to}} complete the project because she encountered harassment. In 2001, Arulpragasam's first public exhibition of paintings after graduating took place at the Euphoria Shop on London's Portobello Road. It featured graffiti art and spray-paint canvasses mixing Tamil political street art with images of London life and consumerist culture. The show was nominated for an Alternative Turner Prize and a monograph book of the collection was published in 2002, titled M.I.A.. Actor Jude Law was among early buyers of her art.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} Stephen V in 1272 {{meant that he}} was succeeded by his infant son Ladislaus IV, with the widowed consort and mother of the boy, Elizabeth, as his regent. At the time, Jacob Svetoslav still held Vidin as a Hungarian vassal. Possibly in 1273, Hungarian rule in Braničevo, west of Jacob's domain, was put to an end by two Cuman–Bulgarian nobles, Darman and Kudelin. Cut off from his Hungarian suzerains and facing <b>the</b> <b>menace</b> of a Bulgarian attack from the east, Jacob Svetoslav once again {{submitted}} to Bulgarian rule. He arrived in the capital Tarnovo to negotiate his submission with Constantine's consort Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene, who was the dominant figure in the empire at the time due to the Tsar's paralysis. There, Jacob was formally adopted by the much younger Maria as her second son, after the infant heir Michael Asen II. This adoption solidified Jacob's ties to the court and meant that he could safely retain his autonomous domain as a Bulgarian vassal. He also harboured hopes to ascend to the throne by ousting Michael when Constantine died. Suspicious of these disloyal intentions of Jacob's, Constantine's consort Maria {{is thought to have}} poisoned him, and he died in 1275 or 1276/1777, shortly before the Uprising of Ivaylo.|$|E

North also appeared as Dennis on an episode of The Donna Reed Show and in the theatrical film Pepe (both 1960). In 1987, a Dennis <b>the</b> <b>Menace</b> live-action television film was released; it was later re-released on video under the title Dennis the Menace: Dinosaur Hunter. Another live-action Dennis <b>the</b> <b>Menace</b> film, starring Walter Matthau as Mr. Wilson and Mason Gamble as Dennis, was released to theaters in 1993. It was originally titled The Real Dennis <b>the</b> <b>Menace</b> before the final name was approved. This was followed with the direct-to-video Dennis <b>the</b> <b>Menace</b> Strikes Again in 1998, starring Don Rickles as Mr. Wilson. The most recent film adaptation, A Dennis <b>the</b> <b>Menace</b> Christmas was released to DVD on November 6, 2007.
