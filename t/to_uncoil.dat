40|$|The present {{paper is}} devoted to studying, {{with the aid of}} {{different}} organic dyes, the transmittance spectra of hemoglobin and immunoglobulin G extracted from the blood of laboratory rats, which have been chronically intoxicated with ethanol. The differences in the spectra are detected, when compare with those for the control group. It is shown that the presence of ethanol in blood probably leads <b>to</b> <b>uncoiling</b> partially the hemoglobin molecules. The essential difference is also found in the transmission spectra of immunoglobulin-dye solution prepared from the blood of the control-group animals and those of the animals of the first generation. The IgG of blood plasma of the first-generation rats probably includes a larger quantity of free remains, which could couple with the intoxicated agents. The small difference between the IgG-dye solution spectra for the animals given to drink ethanol during 6 months and the control-group animals is quite possibly referred to decreasing the IgG concentration after a durable ethanol intake...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe motor protein myosin II plays {{a crucial}} role in muscle contraction. The {{mechanical}} properties of its coiled-coil region, the myosin rod, are important for effective force transduction during muscle function. Previous studies have investigated the static elastic response of the myosin rod. However, analogous to the study of macroscopic complex fluids, how myosin will respond to physiological time-dependent loads can only be understood from its viscoelastic response. Here, we apply atomic force microscopy using a magnetically driven oscillating cantilever to measure the dissipative properties of single myosin rods that provide unique dynamical information about the coiled-coil structure as a function of force. We find that the friction constant of the single myosin rod has a highly nontrivial variation with force; in particular, the single-molecule friction constant is reduced dramatically and increases again as it passes through the coiled-uncoiled transition. This is a direct indication of a large free-energy barrier <b>to</b> <b>uncoiling,</b> which may be related to a fine-tuned dynamic mechanosignaling response to large and unexpected physiological loads. Further, from the critical force at which the minimum in friction occurs we determine the asymmetry of the bistable landscape that controls uncoiling of the coiled coil. This work highlights the sensitivity of the dissipative signal in force unfolding to dynamic molecular structure that is hidden to the elastic signal...|$|R

40|$|Vesicular {{stomatitis}} virus ribonucleoproteins (RNP) {{obtained by}} a detergent treatment of purified virus (vRNP) or from infected HeLa cell cytoplasm (icRNP) were examined by sedimentation in sucrose or Renografin gradients {{in the presence}} or absence of EDTA. It was shown that vRNP and icRNP sediment at the same rate in sucrose and Renografin in the absence of EDTA; however, icRNP sedimented more slowly in the presence of EDTA than did vRNP. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the proteins of vRNA and icRNP recovered from EDTA-containing gradients demonstrated that both RNP structures contained L, N, and NS proteins in the same proportion. Electron microscopy of both RNP structures, in the absence of EDTA, demonstrated that both exist as helical structures ∼ 20 by 700 nm. However, in the presence of EDTA the icRNP was completely uncoiled with a mean length of 4, 095 nm, whereas vRNP was hardly affected. The addition of excess Mg 2 + or Mn 2 + <b>to</b> <b>uncoiled</b> icRNP preparations partially restored the coiled configuration. These observations suggest that the change in sedimentation of icRNP in the presence of EDTA is due to a change from a coiled <b>to</b> an <b>uncoiled</b> conformation, that icRNP and vRNP are not structurally identical, and that icRNP must undergo a conformational change during maturation of VSV from the 20 -by- 700 -nm intracellular form to the 50 -by- 175 -nm form found in intact virus. The icRNP containing L, N, and NS proteins (icRNPL,N,NS) and icRNP containing only N protein (icRNPN), prepared by centrifugation of icRNPL,N,NS in CsCl to remove L and NS, were compared by cosedimentation in sucrose gradients. There was a decrease in sedimentation rate of icRNPN due to loss of L and NS. This sedimentation difference was also apparent in the presence of EDTA; however, both icRNPL,N,NS and icRNPN sedimented at a much slower rate in the presence of EDTA, and by electron microscopy both were completely uncoiled. These observations suggest that N protein alone is responsible for the 20 -by- 700 -nm coiled structure and that the divalent cation interactions disrupted by EDTA are N-N or N-RNA interactions. These results are discussed with regard to vesicular stomatitis virus maturation...|$|R

40|$|Electron {{microscope}} {{examination of}} fragmented elastic tissue obtained from fish swim bladder, bovine ligamentum nuchae, and aortas of various mammals, including man, reveals characteristically formed fibers and much amorphous material. Boiling in dilute acid destroys the associated collagen {{but does not}} obviously alter the elastic tissue. Digestion in crystalline trypsin of either boiled or unheated tissue {{from any of the}} above-mentioned sources causes the release of thin threads ranging in length from 0. 1 µ to many microns. A large proportion of these threads are evenly and tightly coiled double helices formed from at least two interlacing filaments and measuring about 120 A in width. The distance between coils ranges from about 470 to 590 A. The individual smooth filaments, many of which are present in parallel pairs, measure approximately 70 A in width. Raising the pH of a neutral suspension of threads from ligamentum nuchae lowers the ratio of helical threads <b>to</b> <b>uncoiled</b> filaments, whereas lowering the pH with acetic acid results in clumping of threads with complete loss of identity at about pH 3. 6. Threads and filaments obtained from all sources studied were destroyed in the temperature range 75 – 85 °C. at pH 7. It is concluded that the elastic fiber is a two component system composed of bundles of trypsin-resistant threads of characteristic form and size plus a trypsin-sensitive, heat-resistant "amorphous" binding matrix. The possible relationship of this structure to the elastic properties of the tissue is discussed...|$|R

The kinetics of barrier overcoming are considered and the operational quantities and experimental procedures are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Gram-negative {{bacteria}} often initiate their colonization by use {{of extended}} attachment organelles, so called pili. When exposed to force, the rod of helix-like pili {{has been found to}} be highly extendable, mainly attributed <b>to</b> <b>uncoiling</b> and recoiling of its quaternary structure. This provides the bacteria with the ability to redistribute an external force among a multitude of pili, which enables them to withstand strong rinsing flows, which, in turn, facilitates adherence and colonization processes critical to virulence. Thus, pili fibers are possible targets for novel antibacterial agents. By use of a substance that compromises compliance of the pili, the ability of bacteria to redistribute external forces can be impaired, so they will no longer be able to resist strong urine flow and thus be removed from the host. It is possible such a substance can serve as an alternative to existing antibiotics in the future or be a part of a multi-drug. In this work we investigated whether it is possible to achieve this by targeting the recoiling process. The test substance was purified PapD. The effect of PapD on the compliance of P pili was assessed at the single organelle level {{by use of}} force-measuring optical tweezers. We showed that the recoiling process, and thus the biomechanical compliance, in particular the recoiling process, can be impaired by the presence of PapD. This leads to a new concept in the search for novel drug candidates combating uropathogenic bacterial infections-"coilicides", targeting the subunits of which the pilus rod is composed...|$|R
40|$|A {{finite element}} model is first used to {{calculate}} the modal pressure difference for a box model of the cochlea, which shows that the number of fluid elements across the width of the cochlea determines the accuracy with which the near field, or short wavenumber, component of the fluid coupling is reproduced.

It is, however, the far field, or long wavelength, component of the fluid coupling that is most affected by the geometry.

6000|$|I {{called to}} my two {{boys who were}} {{skinning}} birds below and said, [...] "Here's a big snake in the roof;" [...] {{but as soon as}} I had shown it to them they rushed {{out of the house and}} begged me to come out directly. Finding they were too much afraid to do anything, we called some of the labourers in the plantation, and soon had half a dozen men in consultation outside. One of these, a native of Bouru, where there are a great many snakes, said he would get him out, and proceeded to work in a businesslike manner. He made a strong noose of rattan, and with a long pole in the other hand poked at the snake, who then began slowly <b>to</b> <b>uncoil</b> itself. He then managed to slip the noose over its head, and getting it well on to the body, dragged the animal down. There was a great scuffle as the snake coiled round the chairs and posts to resist his enemy, but at length the man caught hold of its tail, rushed out of the house (running so quick that the creature seemed quite confounded), and tried to strike its head against a tree. He missed however, and let go, and the snake got under a dead trunk close by. It was again poked out, and again the Bouru man caught hold of its tail, and running away quickly dashed its head with a swing against a tree, and it was then easily killed with a hatchet. It was about twelve feet long and very thick, capable of doing much mischief and of swallowing a dog or a child.|$|E
60|$|Among {{the reefs}} of rock upon the Australian coast, an explorer's dredge often brings {{up to the}} surface some tangled tresses of reddish seaweed, which, when placed for a while in a bucket of water, begin slowly <b>to</b> <b>uncoil</b> {{themselves}} as if endowed with animal life, and finally to swim about with a gentle tremulous motion in a mute inquiring way from side to side of the pail that contains them. Looked at closely with an attentive eye, the complex moving mass gradually resolves itself into two parts: one a ruddy seaweed with long streaming fronds; the other, a strangely misshapen and dishevelled pipe-fish, exactly imitating the weed itself in form and colour. When removed from the water, this queer pipe-fish proves in general outline somewhat to resemble the well-known hippocampus or sea-horse of the aquariums, whose dried remains, in a mummified state, form a standing wonder in many tiny domestic museums. But the Australian species, instead of merely mimicking the knight on a chess-board, looks rather like a hippocampus in the most advanced stage of lunacy, with its tail and fins and the appendages of its spines flattened out into long thin streaming filaments, utterly indistinguishable in hue and shape from the fucus round which the creature clings for support with its prehensile tail. Only a rude and shapeless rough draught of a head, vaguely horse-like in contour, and inconspicuously provided with an unobtrusive snout and a pair of very unnoticeable eyes, at all suggests to the most microscopic observer its animal nature. Taken as a whole, nobody could at first sight distinguish it in any way from the waving weed among which it vegetates.|$|E

40|$|Structural {{changes of}} pyrene-labeled and unlabeled poly(maleic acid/octyl vinyl ether) (PMAOVE) and poly-(maleic acid/methyl vinyl ether) (PMAMVE) {{with changes in}} pH have been {{investigated}} in this study.

The vibrational fine structure of the pyrene fluorescence (I 3 /I 1) and the ratio between excimer and monomer fluorescence (Ie/Im) of both pyrene-labeled and unlabeled PMAMVE and PMAOVE suggest that, at pH 4, the polymers are in the coiled form and PMAOVE forms hydrophobic nanodomains.

Samples were then allowed to proceed through the cell cycle for increasing times. The DNA loops were induced in situ <b>to</b> completely <b>uncoil</b> around the nuclear matrix. The autoradiographic analysis shows that, under the experimental conditions used, 'non-origin' regions behave as expected from previous studies, i. e., they associate with the nuclear matrix only when they become part of a replication fork, whereas active origins of replication remain associated with the matrix throughout the cell cycle...|$|R
