The man on the little stool behind the President, is the Capo Lazzarone, a kind of tribune of the people, appointed on their behalf to see that all is fairly conducted: attended by a few personal friends. A ragged, swarthy fellow he is: with long matted hair hanging down all over his face: and covered, from head to foot, with most unquestionably genuine dirt.

Romualgo Rodrigo, OAR. which had be en published in «Periodica» (1973), pp. 503 - 550, a journal of the Gregorian University in Rome. Reporting a grand Lumber of facts and considerations, the author explains the actual condition of matrimonial processes in Spain. He insists in the judidal, and not administrative, nature of the ratifying Decree, as determined in the Motu proprio. Causas matrimoniales». Spain does not recognize divorce, and the transaction of the causes of marriage according to canon law, whether it be a case of nullity or separation, is reserved for the Church courts. The government recognizes these decisions to all legal effects, which should be determined by the civil courts. The author points out the advantage that Spanish law offers with respect to marriage and the family since the civil code does not concede legal effects to a consented separation, in agreement with Church doctrine and law. Therigidity of Spanishlaw withrespect to the dissolution of the marriage bond, the decision of the married couple to live apart, and the parentalresponsabilities regarding the Catholic upbringing of the children is a logical consequence of this posture. Considering the current state of divorce, nullificationand separation, the •author insists that the Church must, whenever possible, strive to safeguard the dignitv and holiness of marriage and of the family; and should not surrender its right to decide cases of matrimonial separation. In relation to the service which the Church offers its faithful seeking justice in matrimonial affairs, this paper studies the principies which should guide the organization of the ecclesiastical courts. The author hasexamined with special attention the convenience of the Rota of the Apostolic Nunciatura in Madrid, in •relation to the lower Spanish and pontificalcourts, specially the Sacred Roman Rota. The author analizes subsequently the arguments which are employed in Spain to discredit the ecclesiastical tribunales. At the end of this paper various conclusions and suggestions are offered with respect to the unipersonal diocesan courts, the provincial and diocesan <b>tribunales,</b> the <b>courts</b> in Barcelona and Madrid, and the Rota of the Apostolic Nunciature. The report also provides interesting illustrations, showing the different levels of the distinct tribunales. The author advocates a serious study of the Rota...|$|R
