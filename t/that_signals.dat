5|$|Lucas {{stated that}} he {{conceived}} the Star Wars saga's story {{in the form of}} a plot outline in 1973. However, he later clarified that, at the time of the saga's conception, he had not fully realized the details—only major plot points. He began working on Episode III even before the previous film, , was released, proposing to concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven battles on seven planets. Michael Kaminski, in The Secret History of Star Wars, surmises that Lucas found flaws with Anakin's fall to the dark side and radically re-organized the plot. For instance, instead of opening the film with various Clone Wars battles, Lucas decided instead to focus on Anakin, ending the film's first act with his killing of Count Dooku, an action <b>that</b> <b>signals</b> his descent to the dark side.|$|E

25|$|Cushing's syndrome, {{also known}} as hyperadrenocorticism, is {{characterized}} {{by an increase in}} glucocorticoids secreted by the adrenal glands. About 85 percent of cases are caused by a tumor in the pituitary gland, while 15 percent are caused by an adrenal tumor. The pituitary gland produces a hormone <b>that</b> <b>signals</b> the adrenal gland to produce cortisol; a tumor can cause it to produce the adrenal-stimulating hormone even when it is not needed. Signs include increased appetite, increased drinking and urination, a pot-bellied appearance, muscle weakness, and lethargy. Cushing's can be caused by overuse of steroid medications; in some cases, stopping the medication is enough to solve the problem. Diagnosis can be difficult as there are no tests with both high sensitivity and specificity.Treatments inclulde mitotane, trilostane, ketoconazole, or selegiline. Surgery is used in some cases of adrenal tumors.|$|E

This daily tradition wasn't always this highly publicized either. In fact, it was only in 1995 that the NYSE began having special guests ring the bells on a regular basis. Prior to that, ringing the bells was usually the responsibility of the exchange's floor managers.|$|E
25|$|However, {{humans are}} limited in their {{capacity}} for reparative regeneration, which occurs in response to injury. One of the most studied regenerative responses in humans is the hypertrophy of the liver following liver injury. For example, the original mass of the liver is re-established {{in direct proportion to}} the amount of liver removed following partial hepatectomy, which indicates <b>that</b> <b>signals</b> from the body regulate liver mass precisely, both positively and negatively, until the desired mass is reached. This response is considered cellular regeneration (a form of compensatory hypertrophy) where the function and mass of the liver is regenerated through the proliferation of existing mature hepatic cells (mainly hepatocytes), but the exact morphology of the liver is not regained. This process is driven by growth factor and cytokine regulated pathways.|$|E

25|$|The light cone has an {{essential}} role within the concept of causality. It is possible for a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time ofnbsp&O to the position and time of D (Fig.nbsp&2‑4). It is hence possible for eventnbsp&O to have a causal influence on eventnbsp&D. The future light cone contains all the events that could be causally influenced by O. Likewise, {{it is possible for}} a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time of A, to the position and time of O. The past light cone contains all the events that could have a causal influence on O. In contrast, assuming <b>that</b> <b>signals</b> cannot travel faster than the speed of light, any event, like e.g.nbsp&B ornbsp&C, in the spacelike region (Elsewhere), cannot either effect eventnbsp&O, nor can they be affected by eventnbsp&O employing such signalling. Under this assumption any causal relationship between eventnbsp&O and any events in the spacelike region of a light cone is excluded.|$|E
25|$|Light has an {{associated}} frequency, and this frequency {{may be used}} to drive the workings of a clock. The gravitational redshift leads to an important conclusion about time itself: Gravity makes time run slower. Suppose we build two identical clocks whose rates are controlled by some stable atomic transition. Place one clock on top of the tower, while the other clock remains on the ground. An experimenter on top of the tower observes <b>that</b> <b>signals</b> from the ground clock are lower in frequency than those of the clock next to her on the tower. Light going up the tower is a just a wave, and it is impossible for wave crests to disappear on the way up. Exactly as many oscillations of light arrive {{at the top of the}} tower as were emitted at the bottom. The experimenter concludes that the ground clock is running slow, and can confirm this by bringing the tower clock down to compare side-by-side with the ground clock. For a 1km tower, the discrepancy would amount to about 9.4nanoseconds per day, easily measurable with modern instrumentation.|$|E
25|$|The {{spinal cord}} {{processes}} and interprets proprioception {{in a manner}} similar to how our visual system processes information. When we view a painting, the brain interprets the total visual field, as opposed to processing each individual pixel of information independently, and then derives an image. At any instant the spinal cord receives an ensemble of information from all receptors throughout the body <b>that</b> <b>signals</b> a proprioceptive “image” that represents time and space, and it computes which neurons to excite next based on the most recently perceived “images.” The importance of the CPG is not simply its ability to generate repetitive cycles, but also to receive, interpret, and predict the appropriate sequences of actions during any part of the step cycle, i.e., state dependence. The peripheral input then provides important information from which the probabilities of a given set of neurons being active at any given time can be finely tuned to a given situation during a specific phase of a step cycle. An excellent example of this is when a mechanical stimulus is applied to the dorsum of the paw of a cat. When the stimulus is applied during the swing phase, the flexor muscles of that limb are excited, and the result is enhanced flexion in order to step over the obstacle that created the stimulus. However, when the same stimulus is applied during stance, the extensors are excited. Thus, the functional connectivity between mechanoreceptors and specific interneuronal populations within the spinal cord varies according to the physiological state. Even the efficacy of the monosynaptic input from muscle spindles to the motor neuron changes readily from one part of the step cycle to another, according to whether a subject is running or walking.|$|E

500|$|The Japanese {{attacked}} the transports again the following day, {{but none of}} Saratogas aircraft were involved. Concerned about his declining fuel reserves and worried about air and submarine attacks after losing 20% of his fighters, Fletcher requested permission from Ghormley to withdraw one day early to refuel. This was granted and Fletcher's carriers were mostly out of range by the morning of 9 August. This meant that the transports lacked air cover, but the only Japanese airstrike of the day specifically targeted the carriers and ignored the transports entirely. Fletcher loitered southeast of the Solomons, waiting for the Japanese carriers <b>that</b> <b>signals</b> intelligence told him were en route to be spotted.

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{model of}} the transmission line was probably described by Georg Ohm (1827) who established that resistance in a wire is proportional to its length.*John C. Shedd, Mayo D. Hershey, [...] "The history of Ohm's law", The Popular Science Monthly, pp.599-614, December 1913 ISSN 0161-7370. The Ohm model thus included only resistance. Latimer Clark noted <b>that</b> <b>signals</b> were delayed and elongated along a cable, an undesirable form of distortion now called dispersion but then called retardation, and Michael Faraday (1853) established that {{this was due to}} the capacitance present in the transmission line. Lord Kelvin (1854) found the correct mathematical description needed in his work on early transatlantic cables; he arrived at an equation identical to the conduction of a heat pulse along a metal bar. This model incorporates only resistance and capacitance, but that is all that was needed in undersea cables dominated by capacitance effects. Kelvin's model predicts a limit on the telegraph signalling speed of a cable but Kelvin still did not use the concept of bandwidth, the limit was entirely explained in terms of the dispersion of the telegraph symbols. The mathematical {{model of the}} transmission line reached its fullest development with Oliver Heaviside. Heaviside (1881) introduced series inductance and shunt conductance into the model making four distributed elements in all. This model is now known as the telegrapher's equation and the distributed elements are called the primary line constants.Heaviside, O, Electrical Papers, vol 1, pp.139-140, Boston, 1925 ...|$|E
500|$|The nests can be {{more than}} two metres (six feet) in {{diameter}} and nearly a metre (three feet) high. Pairs shows high fidelity to the nest site, often refurbishing and reusing a nest {{for as many as}} five breeding seasons. The clutch is one or two eggs (rarely three or four) which are incubated by both sexes for about 31 days (range 26–35 days). Eggs are chalky white and weigh about 240grams. When disturbed from the nest, parents may sometimes attempt to conceal the eggs by attempting to cover them with material {{from the edge of the}} nest. The eggshells are removed by the parents after the chicks hatch either by carrying away the fragments or by swallowing them. Approximately 30% of all breeding pairs succeed in raising chicks in any year, and most of the successful pairs raise one or two chicks each, with brood sizes of three being rare. The chicks are fed by the parents for the first few days, but are able to feed independently after that and follow their parents for food. When alarmed, the parent cranes use a low korr-rr call <b>that</b> <b>signals</b> chicks to freeze and lie still. Young birds stay with their parents until the subsequent breeding season.
