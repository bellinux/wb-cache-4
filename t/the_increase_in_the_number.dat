5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century the fraternity system continued to expand at such a rapid pace that university newspapers questioned if <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of fraternities would ever end. Many fraternity chapters were founded during this time that no longer exist at the university, such Alpha Chi Rho, Theta Nu Epsilon, and Delta Chi. Other chapters that are still active were founded at this time as well, such as Theta Chi and Phi Sigma Kappa.|$|E

5|$|Test cricket {{is played}} between {{international}} cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Unlike One Day Internationals, Test matches consist of two innings per team, having no limit in their number of overs. Test cricket is first-class cricket, so statistics and records set in Test matches are also counted toward first-class records. The duration of Tests, currently limited to five days, has varied through Test history, ranging from {{three days to}} timeless matches. The earliest match now recognised as a Test was played between England and Australia in March 1877; since then there have been over 2,000 Tests played by 11 teams. The frequency of Tests has steadily increased partly because of <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of Test-playing countries, and partly as cricket boards seek to maximise their revenue.|$|E

40|$|Present {{work has}} got its aim {{of finding the}} role of {{different}} process parameters for A 713 alloy on the Mechanical properties of the sand castings. Different input process parameters taken under consideration are grain fineness number, moisture content, green strength and clay content. The different values of aforesaid parameters affecting the Tensile strength, Hardness and Impact strength of the final castings have been optimized by Taguchi optimization technique. Castings were prepared as per the Taguchi’s L 9 orthogonal array and their Mechanical properties as mentioned above were deduced out. It observed by graphs that the hardness shows decreasing and <b>increasing</b> trend with <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grain fineness number and moisture content. It <b>increases</b> with <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clay content and also shows <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> and decreasing trend with <b>the</b> decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> green strength. Impact strength shows decreasing and <b>increasing</b> trend with <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grain fineness number and moisture content. Effect of clay content and green strength is almost insignificant on impact strength of A 713 alloy. Tensile strength shows decreasing and <b>increasing</b> trend with <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grain fineness number where {{on the other hand}} it shows a sharp decline by <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> moisture content.
