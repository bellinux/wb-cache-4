40|$|Sinusoidal {{modeling}} {{has enjoyed}} a rich history in both speech and music applications, including sound transformations, compression, denoising, and auditory scene analysis. For such applications, the underlying signal model must efficiently capture salient audio features (Goodwin 1998). In this article, we present an accurate, efficient, and flexible three-part model for audio signals consisting of sines, <b>transients,</b> and <b>noise</b> by extending spectral modeling synthesis (SMS) (Serra and Smith 1990) with an explicit flexible transient model called transient-modeling synthesis (TMS). The sinusoidal transformation system (STS) (McAulay and Quatieri 1986) and SMS find the slowly varying sinusoidal components in a signal using spectral-peak-picking algorithms. Subtracting the synthesized sinusoids from the original signal creates a residual consisting of <b>transients</b> and <b>noise</b> (Serra 1989; George and Smith 1992). However, sinusoids do not model this residual well. Although {{it is possible to}} model <b>transients</b> and <b>noise</b> by a sum of sinusoidal signals (as with the Fourier transform), it is neither efficient, because transient and noisy signals require many sinusoids for their description, nor meaningful, because transients are short-lived signals, while the sinusoidal model uses sinusoids that are active on a much larger time scale. In the STS system (generally applied to speech), the <b>transient</b> + <b>noise</b> residual is often masked sufficiently to be ignored (McAulay and Quatieri 1986). In music applications, this residual is often important to the integrity of th...|$|R

50|$|Record restoration, a {{particular}} kind of audio restoration, is the process of converting theanalog signal stored on gramophone records (either 78 rpm shellac, or 45 and 33⅓ rpmvinyl) into digital audio files that can then be edited with computer software and eventually stored on a hard-drive, recorded to digital tape, or burned to a CD or DVD. The process may be divided into several separate steps performed in the following order: 1. Cleaning the record, to prevent unwanted audio artefacts from being introduced in the capture that will necessitate correction in the digital domain (e.g. transient surface noise caused by dirt), and to prevent unnecessary wear and damage to the stylus used in playback.2. Transcription of the record to another format on another medium (generally a digital format such as a wav file on a computer);3. Processing the raw sound file with software in order to remove <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> resulting from record surface damage (clicks, pops, and crackle cause by surface scratches and wear);4. Using software to adjust the volume and equalization; 5. Processing the audio with digital and analogue techniques to reduce surface/wideband noise; 6. Saving the file in the desired format (WAV, MP3, FLAC, etc.). The source of the information for these steps is available from various websites and the help files for the software employed in the process.|$|E
30|$|The LTP filter {{generally}} {{searches the}} most similar signal segment {{to the current}} signal segment within a pre-defined search range [11, 12]. If <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> component exists in the search range, however, a <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> segment in the current frame can be predicted by the other <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> in the search range. In such case, the LTP filter models the characteristic of the <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> and brings residual noise in synthesized speech. Another problem of the conventional LTP method is that the LTP filter cannot preserve pitch information at the onset and the transition region of speech because a reference pitch does not exists. As a result, the conventional LTP method needs to be modified to accurately model the pitch related speech component without being affected by <b>transient</b> <b>noise.</b> To solve the first problem on having <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> component within a pitch search interval, we need to skip the <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> region while searching a reference pitch. However, skipping the <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> region occasionally results in failure in the pitch prediction when the <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> is located where the reference pitch exists. Therefore, we extend the pitch search range to cover multiple pitch periods. The pitch estimation problem at the onset and the transition region of speech can be solved by adopting a look-ahead memory and a backward pitch estimation method. The modified LTP significantly reduces the residual noise in an enhanced signal and successfully reconstructs desired speech after the <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> reduction.|$|E

Since the <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> is recorded in real environment, additive background noise such as fan noise is also included in the recoded noise signal.

30|$|After {{removing}} <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> {{from the}} residual signal, the speech component extracted by the STP filter or the LTP filter should be re-synthesized. Please {{note that the}} pre-filter should not keep the characteristic of <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> not to bring any residual noise. In general, <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> lasts for the certain amount of time, e.g., up to 50 ms, and has short-term correlation. Therefore, the STP filter which models the short-term characteristic of signal is not appropriate for our purpose. On the contrary, <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> component which generally has short duration would not affect an LTP result [7, 8, 10, 11, 13].|$|E
30|$|The {{conventional}} LTP method {{predicts a}} speech segment by utilizing a previous speech segment at one pitch period before [10 – 12]. Unlike the STP filter, the LTP filter is {{not affected by}} the short-term characteristic of <b>transient</b> <b>noise.</b> However, the LTP filter also models <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> component if the <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> exists within the search range of the pitch lag. One way of reducing the problem is to skip the <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> region while searching the pitch lag. Note also that, the conventional LTP method cannot estimate pitch at the onset or the transition region of vowel because the reference pitch segment does not exists.

In general, <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> is generated by tapping a recording device or an object near it. Since <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> randomly occurs in time and has a time-varying unknown impulse response, the characteristic of the noise is not easy to estimate. In other words, both the occurrence time and the impulse response of <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> are unpredictable. The good thing is that <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> usually is a fast varying signal with short duration and high amplitude thus its activity is relatively easy to detect [4 – 8].|$|E

Furthermore, consistency tests currently used to try to eliminate these <b>noise</b> <b>transients</b> are not applicable to general networks of detectors with different orientations and noise spectra.

We observe that voiced speech spectral com-ponents are slowly varying compared to <b>transient</b> <b>noise.</b> Thus, by applying an algorithm for noise power spectral density (PSD) esti-mation, configured to track faster variations than pseudo-stationary noise, the PSD of speech components may be estimated. In addition, we utilize diffusion maps to embed the measurements into a new do-main. We obtain a new representation which enables clustering of different <b>transient</b> <b>noise</b> types. The new representation is incorpo-rated into a NL filter as a better affinity metric for averaging over transient instances.
