He returns {{to the office of}} Dr. Duncan who tells him that he wanted to teach him a lesson although Jeff gets his car keys back. As he is about to leave campus, Jeff runs into Pierce and Troy, and shows his ability <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> better about themselves through advice and encouragement. The others join, and Jeff admits to being a fraud. He says that he does not have the test answers, and that he will probably flunk next day's test. The group has now taken a liking to him, and they invite him back in. The episode ends with a dedication to the recently deceased John Hughes, whose film The Breakfast Club had been repeatedly referenced throughout the episode.|$|E
25|$|Considered {{the most}} {{powerful}} wizard in the world, Dumbledore is benevolent and wise, a good wizard {{in the style of}} Merlin. He almost constantly gives off an aura of serenity and composure, rarely displaying intense emotions of anger or fear. Yet despite his benign nature, it is said that Dumbledore was the only wizard Lord Voldemort ever truly feared. Dumbledore is very eccentric and even slightly effeminate; he is very fond of knitting patterns and frequently wears flamboyant clothing (at one point, he is seen wearing a flowered bonnet). He is also known for his odd displays of whimsicality; he often uses humour <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> comfortable in his presence. As a supremely talented wizard, Dumbledore displays numerous examples of extraordinary powers. His abilities as a wizard are combined with a kind of cunning and subtlety of mind that allowed him to comprehend human nature and turn the better aspects of humanity (trust, love, and friendship) to Voldemort's disadvantage in particular.|$|E

The story was constructed differently than what was popular at the time. There were no villains, violence, or battles between good and evil.

Thereafter she became highest paid movie star (Males and Females) that remained till 2002.|$|E
500|$|The {{frontman}} {{was more}} involved in the composition of Born Villain than he was for preceding records. Manson has said that this is a result of him beginning the project with a different mindset from that of his chief collaborator, Twiggy. He said he developed a [...] "clear idea" [...] of the album's direction early in its writing stages, which he was reluctant to share {{with other members of the}} band. He worked on the album in a minimally decorated apartment located above a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles, which was once owned by actor Billy Zane and was the site where Manson created his first painting in 1996. The album contains seven songs which feature the vocalist as a composer, including three where he is listed as the sole writer. At the time of the album's release, Manson distanced himself from the approach he took when creating previous albums, explaining: [...] "On the last two records I made, I was trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> what I was feeling—which wasn't a good idea, because I was feeling like shit. Check mark number one: don't make records that make people feel bad." ...|$|E

Many people were impressed by the perfect services rendered by the saint and expressed interest in rendering perfect service in the Sattainathar Temple, Sirkazhi. People engaged themselves in Shaivism duties like plucking flowers, preparation of flower garlands, fetching holy water for consecration, writing hymns, chanting hymns etc., The saint also provided facilities in the temple complex <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> comfortable while rendering selfless service to the god.

5000|$|The {{approbation}} maxim states: 'Minimize {{the expression}} of beliefs which express dispraise of other; maximize {{the expression of}} beliefs which express approval of other.' It is preferred to praise others {{and if this is}} impossible, to sidestep the issue, to give some sort of minimal response (possibly through the use of euphemisms), or to remain silent. The first part of the maxim avoids disagreement; the second part intends <b>to</b> <b>make</b> other <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> good by showing solidarity.

2500|$|Most importantly, Butler wrote Kindred as a {{reaction}} to an impassioned statement from a young man involved in black consciousness raising, who, ashamed of the humility and subservience older generations of African Americans, considered them traitors to their people and wished he could kill them all. Butler disagreed with this view. From her personal experience, what older generations of African Americans had endured had to be put into historical context to be fully understood as the silent, courageous resistance that it was. She then decided to create a present-day character and send her (originally it was a him) back to slavery to explore how hard it would be for a modern person to survive in such harsh conditions. As she explains in a 2004 interview with Allison Keyes, she [...] "set out <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> history." ...|$|E

Chapman then approached Gillian Armstrong who said:I really loved it because I love Helen's writing. I think she has incredibly acute observation of people and wonderful poetry in her writing. I did think the biggest challenge was that so much was in one house, but I took that on board and thought, well, we'll just have to do everything possible <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>people</b> still <b>feel</b> they're watching a movie.

When the suggestions were first put to him in the late 1970s, Richard responded by saying: [...] "It's untrue. People are very unfair with their criticism and their judgements. I've had girlfriends. But people seem to think that if a bloke doesn't sleep around he must be gay. Marriage is a very special thing to me. I'm certainly {{not going to do it}} just <b>to</b> <b>make</b> other <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> satisfied."

40|$|The {{unemployment}} rate, {{which is}} considered {{as one of the}} most important factors that determine one 2 ̆ 7 s economy, could be negatively affected by overly generous unemployment benefits. Unemployment becomes one of the most important issues facing policy makers during economic hard times. The concern when deciding on unemployment is the possible effect of raising unemployment benefits on those who receive them. This consideration by the government seemed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> settled while unemployed.

500|$|According to {{historian}} Kerry Trask, Black Hawk and {{his fellow}} prisoners were treated like celebrities because the Indians served as a living embodiment of the noble savage myth that had become popular in the eastern United States. Then and later, argues Trask, white Americans absolved themselves of complicity in the dispossession of Native Americans by expressing admiration or sympathy for defeated Indians like Black Hawk. The mythologizing of Black Hawk continued, argues Trask, with the many plaques and memorials that were later erected in his honor. [...] "Indeed," [...] writes Trask, [...] "most of the reconstructed memory of the Black Hawk War has been designed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> white <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> good about themselves." [...] Black Hawk also became an admired symbol of resistance among Native Americans, even among descendants {{of those who had}} opposed him.|$|R

500|$|After {{seeing the}} first three episodes, Maxwell Zachs called the series [...] "a disappointment".

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the phenomenon of}} the demographic ageing of the population and educational opportunities for older adults in Lithuania. Ageing population is a natural outcome of demographic evolution of society. However, a growing number of older people in Lithuania as well as in other European countries requires continuous revision of societal resources in social security, economics, education, health care areas and their adjustment to the new demands. Though current discussion in Lithuania highlights the inclusion of older adults into active social life through educational activities, the studies in diverse areas show that a small number of older people take part in lifelong learning. For this reason and in the attempt <b>to</b> <b>make</b> older <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> satisfaction with life it is necessary to encourage their activity, to promote their social roles, to give them opportunities to take up voluntary tasks, educational and cultural functions and study new subjects...|$|R
