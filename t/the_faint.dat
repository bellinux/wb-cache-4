5|$|On July 2, 2009, July 3, 2009, and August 8, 2009, {{use of the}} NIFS {{integral}} field spectrograph with ALTAIR {{allowed the}} astronomers {{to collect data on}} the spectrum of <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> object and its star. Analysis of the spectra and the objects' astrometry (how the star and <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> object change position in the sky) led to the confirmation of the companion HIP 78530 b.|$|E

The lyrics reference the events Duff experienced in the years leading to the album's release, and the album's songs contain influences {{of rock and roll}} and hip hop music.|$|E

5|$|GJ 3021 is a solar twin—a star {{very like}} our own Sun—around 57 light-years distant with a {{spectral}} type G8V and magnitude of 6.7. It has a Jovian planet companion (GJ 3021 b). Orbiting about 0.5AU from its sun, it has a minimum mass 3.37 times that of Jupiter and a period of around 133 days. The system is a complex one as <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> star GJ 3021B orbits {{at a distance of}} 68 AU; it is a red dwarf of spectral type M4V.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up imaging {{took place}} on July 2, 2009 and August 30, 2010 using the same instruments, as astronomers hoped to reveal this {{companion}} object's proper motion, or the rate that it moves over time. Additional follow-up data was recovered {{in the spring and}} summer of 2010, but large errors in the data's astrometry led the investigating astronomers to disregard it. The observations over the three years was compiled, with the data used to filter out pixelated portions of the images and improve the images' quality. The result suggested not only that <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> object in the image was nearby the star HIP 78530, but that it was a brown dwarf or planet in size. Further study would be needed to prove its true nature.|$|E
5|$|The {{damaging}} {{effects of}} ionising radiation were not {{known at the}} time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed. She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, and she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> light that the substances gave off in the dark. Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war. Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to cataracts) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.|$|E

5|$|The {{supernova}} SN 1006 {{appeared in}} the southern constellation of Lupus during the year 1006 CE. This was the brightest recorded star ever {{to appear in the}} night sky, and its presence was noted in China, Egypt, Iraq, Italy, Japan and Switzerland. It may also have been noted in France, Syria, and North America. Egyptian physician, astronomer and astrologer Ali ibn Ridwan gave the brightness of this star as one-quarter the brightness of the Moon. Modern astronomers have discovered <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> remnant of this explosion and determined that it was only 7,100 light-years from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Xerocomellus zelleri {{was first}} {{described}} by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912, based on specimens he {{found on the}} campus of the University of Washington. Murrill named it Ceriomyces zelleri before switching the genus later that year to Boletus. In 1944, Walter Henry Snell thought the taxon would be more appropriate in the genus Xerocomus. In 1959, mycologists Rolf Singer, Snell and Esther A. Dick transferred the species to Boletellus, explaining that the microstructure of the trama and <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> ornamentation of the spores were inconsistent with placement in Xerocomus. American mycologist Harry D. Thiers, in his 1976 monograph on North American boletes, claimed that he failed to consistently find ornamentation on the spores of material he collected, and preferred to retain the species in Boletus. In 2011, it was moved to the genus Xerocomellus.|$|E
5|$|As a whole, {{the ring}} system of Uranus is unlike either <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> dusty rings of Jupiter or the broad and complex rings of Saturn, {{some of which}} are {{composed}} of very bright material—water ice. However, there are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system; the Saturnian F ring and the Uranian ε ring are both narrow, relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons. The newly discovered outer ν and μ rings of Uranus are similar to the outer G and E rings of Saturn. Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian rings also resemble the narrow rings of Uranus. In addition, dust bands observed between the main rings of Uranus may be similar to the rings of Jupiter. In contrast, the Neptunian ring system is quite similar to that of Uranus, although it is less complex, darker and contains more dust; the Neptunian rings are also positioned further from the planet.|$|E

5|$|The dust is {{constantly}} being {{removed from the}} main ring {{by a combination of}} Poynting–Robertson drag and electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. Volatile materials, for example ices, evaporate quickly. The lifetime of dust particles in the ring is from 100 to 1000years, so the dust must be continuously replenished in the collisions between large bodies with sizes from 1cm to 0.5km and between the same large bodies and high velocity particles coming from outside the Jovian system. This parent body population is confined to the narrow—about 1000km—and bright outer part of the main ring, and includes Metis and Adrastea. The largest parent bodies must be less than 0.5km in size. The upper limit on their size was obtained by New Horizons spacecraft. The previous upper limit, obtained from HST and Cassini observations, was near 4km. The dust produced in collisions retains approximately the same orbital elements as the parent bodies and slowly spirals in the direction of Jupiter forming <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> (in back-scattered light) innermost part of the main ring and halo ring. The age of the main ring is currently unknown, but it may be the last remnant of a past population of small bodies near Jupiter.|$|E

25|$|Water-air {{interfaces}} provide {{another source}} of circular polarization. Sunlight that gets scattered back up towards the surface is linearly polarized. If this light is then totally internally reflected back down, its vertical component undergoes a phase shift. To an underwater observer looking up, <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> light outside Snell's window therefore is (partially) circularly polarized.|$|E
