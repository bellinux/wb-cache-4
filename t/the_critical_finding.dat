Both musicians and nonmusicians were affected by instrumentation change in excerpts from a symphonic poem by Liszt (Expt. 3). This finding suggests that timbre may contribute, along with pitch and rhythm, to the identity of musical materials.

Some studies of on line reading suggests that word frequency affects an earlier perceptual, encoding stage and case mixing affects a later central, decision stage (e. g., Reingold, Yang, & Rayner, 2010). Others have suggested otherwise (e. g., Allen, Smith, Lien, Grabbe, & Murphy, 2005; Besner & McCann, 1987).

We measured two event-related potential components: the N 170 (an early peak occurring 140 - 240 ms after stimulus onset, related to structural encoding) and the P 3 (a late peak occurring 400 - 600 ms after stimulus onset, related to stimulus categorization). <b>The</b> <b>critical</b> <b>finding</b> is that the N 170 amplitude was sensitive to case mixing, but the P 3 amplitude was sensitive to word frequency and lexicality.

Reactions to deceit may however differ depending on whether one is being deceived oneself or observes a deceitful exchange between others. In the present study, we investigated whether personal involvement influenced the neural responses associated with the detection of deceit. Subjects watched videos of actors lifting a box and judged whether the actors had been misled about the real weight of the box. Personal involvement was manipulated by having the participants themselves among the actors. <b>The</b> <b>critical</b> <b>finding</b> was that there was activity in amygdala and fusiform gyrus only for the condition in which participants observed themselves being deceived. In contrast, the superior temporal sulcus and anterior cingulate cortex were activated irrespective of whether the participants detected that the experimenter had deceived themselves or another. These four brain areas are all interconnected and are part of the discrete neural system subserving social cognition. Our results provide direct evidence, using judgments of deceit in a social context, that the crucial factor for amygdala activation is the involvement of the subjects because they are the target of the deceit. We interpret the activation of the amygdala in this situation as reflecting the greater affective reaction when one is deceived oneself.

Existing research has focused on identifying the legal constraints on BIM adoption without a systematic analysis of standard contracts to identify changes needed to facilitate BIM integration. This study focuses on the BIM legal challenges and identified 10 main thematic areas including a number of key subthemes. These themes form a Qualitative Content Analysis coding frame that is applied to a standardised construction contract. <b>The</b> <b>critical</b> <b>findings</b> of <b>the</b> analysis identifies that the contract uses a ‘traditional’ procurement method that inhibits collaboration, relies on proprietary file formats for data transfer, does not recognize the model as a contract document or include BIM specific processes and protocols. The outcomes of this research provide a mechanism for identifying changes required to contracts for BIM adoption, a transitional roadmap to collaborative BIM adoption and possible avenues for future research...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explicate the nature and {{significance}} of persuasion in lobbying at two levels of the public policy-making process, namely a macro, or cultural context, level and a micro, or issue-specific, level. This project answered two primary substantive research questions: How do lobbyists do what they do communicatively? Why are lobbyists effective persuasively? This effort achieved two significant theoretical accomplishments: symbolic convergence theory was further validated as a general communication theory; lobbying-style communication was identified and named as a new special communication theory. Methodologically, fantasy theme analysis enabled a comprehensive examination of the shared consciousness about common lobbying experiences embedded in the oral histories of thirty-seven current and former registered lobbyists in Austin, Texas. A case study was presented to illustrate the issue-specific fantasizing that occurs involving discrete public policy issues. Recommendations for the improved practice of lobbying were outlined. A follow-up study was proposed to empirically verify <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> <b>findings</b> of <b>the</b> current study. A long-term program of research this work initiates also was described. ...|$|R
