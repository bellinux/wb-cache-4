5|$|Pokémon Red and Blue allow {{players to}} trade Pokémon between <b>two</b> <b>cartridges</b> via a Game Link Cable. This method of trading {{must be done}} to fully {{complete}} the Pokédex since certain Pokémon will only evolve upon being traded and each of the two games have version-exclusive Pokémon. The Link Cable also makes it possible to battle another player's Pokémon team. When playing Red or Blue on a Game Boy Advance or SP, the standard GBA/SP link cable will not work; players must use the Nintendo Universal Game Link Cable instead. Moreover, the English versions of the games are incompatible with their Japanese counterparts, and such trades will corrupt the save files, as the games use different languages and therefore character sets.|$|E
5|$|Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles were {{originally}} planned {{as a single}} game. However, time was limited and the manufacturing costs of a 34-megabit cartridge with NVRAM would have been prohibitively expensive. Sonic Team split the game in half, giving the developers more time to finish the second part, and splitting the cost between <b>two</b> <b>cartridges.</b> The cartridge has {{a small amount of}} non-volatile RAM built into it, which allows the player to save game progress to the game cartridge. Sega planned to release a single cartridge version of both games titled Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Limited Edition, though it was eventually cancelled for unknown reasons; a prototype ROM image of this version was leaked in 2008.|$|E

2500|$|At {{approximately}} 15:40 on Wednesday 19 April 2000 John Carthy went to {{the cabinet}} within which was his shotgun. He brought it, a full box of cartridges and his gun belt {{back to the kitchen}} demonstrating, according to his mother, that [...] "no one was going to put him out of his house". He loaded the gun with <b>two</b> <b>cartridges,</b> went outside the hall door and discharged two shots.|$|E
2500|$|Though [...]38 and [...]357 {{would seem}} to be {{different}} diameter chamberings, they are in fact identical, as [...] is the true bullet diameter of the [...]38 Special cartridge. The [...]38 Special nomenclature relates to the previous use of heeled bullets (such as the [...]38 Short Colt), which were the same diameter as the case. Thus, the only external difference in the <b>two</b> <b>cartridges</b> is a slight difference in length, solely for safety purposes.|$|E
2500|$|Turret presses, most {{commonly}} of the [...] "C" [...] type, {{are similar to}} single stage presses, but permit mounting all of the dies for one cartridge (or sometimes <b>two</b> <b>cartridges)</b> simultaneously, with each die being installed and correctly locked in position with lock rings onto the press at the same time. [...] Batch operations are performed similar as to on a single stage press, but to switch dies, the turret is simply rotated, placing another die in position. [...] Although turret presses operate much like single stage presses, they eliminate much of the setup time required in positioning individual dies correctly.|$|E

2500|$|The [...]460 Weatherby Magnum compares {{well with}} the classic English big bore {{cartridges}}; it exceeds all these cartridges in velocity, energy, trajectory and penetration. Cartridges such as the [...]500 Jeffery, [...]500 Nitro Express, [...]505 Gibbs, [...]577 Nitro Express, [...]600 Nitro Express do however provide a larger diameter bullet while the latter <b>two</b> <b>cartridges</b> are also capable of [...] launching heavier bullets than the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum. At present only the modern classic [...]700 Nitro Express exceeds {{the performance of the}} [...]460 Weatherby and then in only a single category: energy. Cartridges such as the [...]475 A Magnum, [...]500 A-Square, and the [...]550 Magnum which are based on the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum can exceed the performance of the parent cartridge, however, these are considered wildcat and proprietary cartridges.|$|E
2500|$|Full hood, half- or full-facepiece {{designs are}} marketed in many {{varieties}} {{depending on the}} hazard of concern using an air filter which acts passively on air inhaled by the wearer. Two common examples {{of this type of}} respirator are single-use escape hoods and filter masks. The latter are typically simple, light, single-piece, half-face masks and employ the first three mechanical filter mechanisms in the list below to remove particulates from the air stream. [...] The most common of these is the disposable white N95 variety. It is discarded after single use or some extended period depending on the contaminant. Filter masks also come in replaceable-cartridge, multiple-use models. Typically one or <b>two</b> <b>cartridges</b> attach securely to a mask which has built into it a corresponding number of valves for inhalation and one for exhalation.|$|E
2500|$|While IMI makes a cosmetically similar pistol, {{originally}} {{called the}} Jericho 941 and marketed by Magnum Research as the [...] "Baby Eagle", the guns bear no functional equivalence: the Jericho/Baby Eagle design {{is a standard}} double action, short-recoil design derived from the CZ-75. The one functional similarity is in the IMI developed cartridges. The [...]41 Action Express (or [...]41 AE) developed for the Jericho 941 used a rebated rim, so that the pistol could switch between 9mm Luger and [...]41 AE with just the change of a barrel. This is because the [...]41 AE {{was based on a}} shortened [...]41 Magnum case with the rim and extractor groove cut to the same dimensions of the 9mm Luger. This allowed the same extractor and ejector to work with both cartridges. The [...]50 AE has a similar rebated rim, cut to the same dimensions as the [...]44 Magnum. This is what allows caliber changes between [...]44 Magnum and [...]50 AE with just the change of the barrel and magazine. Beginning January 1, 2009, KBI began importing the Jericho (using its original trade name). KBI Jericho pistols can be distinguished from earlier Jericho models by the addition of an accessory rail just forward the trigger guard. The Jericho 941's name was derived from the <b>two</b> <b>cartridges</b> it chambers, with the conversion kit.|$|E
50|$|The <b>two</b> <b>cartridge</b> slots are {{designed}} to share data between the games. The cartridge placed in slot 1 is the game that will be played, while the cartridge in slot 2 supplies additional data {{for use in the}} main game. Nine of the thirteen SuFami Turbo titles make use of this system.|$|R

2500|$|On April 8, 1927, their appeals exhausted, Sacco and Vanzetti {{were finally}} {{sentenced to death}} in the {{electric}} chair. A worldwide outcry arose and Governor Alvin T. Fuller finally agreed to postpone the executions and set up a committee to reconsider the case. By this time, firearms examination had improved considerably, and it was now known that an automatic pistol could be traced by several different methods if both bullet and casing were recovered from the scene. Automatic pistols could now be traced by unique markings of the rifling on the bullet, by firing pin indentations on the fired primer, or by unique ejector and extractor marks on the casing. The committee appointed to review the case used the services of Major Calvin Goddard in 1927. [...] Major Goddard used Philip Gravelle's newly invented comparison microscope and helixometer, a hollow, lighted magnifier probe used to inspect gun barrels, to make an examination of Sacco’s [...]32 Savage Model 1907, the bullet that allegedly killed Berardelli, and the spent casings allegedly recovered from the scene of the crime. [...] (Defenders of Sacco and Vanzetti claim that the bullet and cartridge case linked to Sacco's pistol were substituted for genuine evidence by the Massachusetts police.) In the presence of one of the defense experts, he fired several test bullets from Sacco's gun into a wad of cotton and prepared them for a comparative examination. [...] He then put the ejected shell casings on the comparison microscope next to casings recovered at the South Braintree murder scene. [...] Then he analyzed them carefully. [...] The third bullet, designated Bullet III matched the rifling marks found on the barrel of Sacco's pistol, while firing pin marks on a [...]32 spent casing recovered from the murder scene matched a test shell casing known to have been fired from Sacco's pistol. [...] Even the defense expert agreed that the <b>two</b> <b>cartridges</b> had been fired from the same gun. The second original defense expert also concurred. The committee upheld the convictions. Nicola Sacco [...] and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were found guilty and executed via electrocution in Massachusetts on August 23, 1927.|$|E

In 1968 the company announced its System 21 small computer system together with its intention to lease the systems starting at a revolutionary price of $40 per month.

60|$|An {{enormous}} three-toed {{track was}} imprinted {{in the soft}} mud before us. The creature, whatever it was, had crossed the swamp and had passed on into the forest. We all stopped to examine that monstrous spoor. If it were indeed a bird--and what animal could leave such a mark?--its foot was so much larger than an ostrich's that its height upon the same scale must be enormous. Lord John looked eagerly round him and slipped <b>two</b> <b>cartridges</b> into his elephant-gun.|$|E

Then the mere {{sensation}} of knowing that there are one or more hungry lions prowling round you somewhere in the dark is disquieting, however well one may be used to it, and, by keeping the attention on the stretch, tends to prevent one from sleeping. In addition to all these troubles, too, I was, I remember, seized with a dreadful longing for a pipe of tobacco, whereas, under the circumstances, I might as well have longed for the moon.|$|E
60|$|Hans {{looked at}} nothing, but Edith's eyes wandered wildly from detail to detail {{of what had}} taken place. Dennin lay without movement. The {{overturned}} chair, hurled onward in the mad whirl, lay near him. Partly under him lay the shot-gun, still broken open at the breech. Spilling out {{of his right hand}} were the <b>two</b> <b>cartridges</b> which he had failed to put into the gun and which he had clutched until consciousness left him. Harkey lay on the floor, face downward, where he had fallen; while Dutchy rested forward on the table, his yellow mop of hair buried in his mush- plate, the plate itself still tilted at an angle of forty-five degrees. This tilted plate fascinated her. Why did it not fall down? It was ridiculous. It was not in the nature of things for a mush-plate to up- end itself on the table, even if a man or so had been killed.|$|E
50|$|The Famicom has <b>two</b> <b>cartridge</b> pins {{that were}} {{originally}} intended to facilitate the Disk System's own sound chip, but are also used by cartridge games to provide sound enhancements. In {{the design of the}} NES, these pins were removed from the cartridge port and relocated to the bottom expansion port. As a result, individual cartridges can not make use of this audio functionality, and many NES localizations suffer from technologically inferior sound compared to their equivalent Famicom versions. Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse is a notable example of this problem.|$|R
50|$|Atari BASIC {{had been}} {{designed}} to fit in a single 8K cartridge, with an optional second cartridge adding additional capability (the Atari 800 home computer featured <b>two</b> <b>cartridge</b> slots). However, the second cartridge was never produced. Instead, OSS produced a disk-based product called BASIC A Plus (or BASIC A+), which was compatible with Atari BASIC but corrected several bugs and added quite a few features. Among the notable features were PRINT USING (for formatted output), trace and debug enhancements, direct DOS commands, and explicit support for the Atari computers' exceptional graphics hardware.|$|R
