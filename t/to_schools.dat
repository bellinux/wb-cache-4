40|$|IntroductionDriven {{largely by}} {{international}} declines in rates of walking and bicycling <b>to</b> <b>school</b> and the noted {{health benefits of}} physical activity for children, research on children’s active commuting <b>to</b> <b>school</b> has expanded rapidly during the past 5 years. We summarize research on predictors and health consequences of active commuting <b>to</b> <b>school</b> and outline and evaluate programs specific to children’s walking and bicycling <b>to</b> <b>school.</b> MethodsLiterature on children’s active commuting <b>to</b> <b>school</b> published before June 2007 was compiled by searching PubMed, PsycINFO, and the National Transportation Library databases; conducting Internet searches on program-based activities; and reviewing relevant transportation journals published during the last 4 years. ResultsChildren who walk or bicycle <b>to</b> <b>school</b> have higher daily levels of physical activity and better cardiovascular fitness than do children who do not actively commute <b>to</b> <b>school.</b> A wide range of predictors of children’s active commuting behaviors was identified, including demographic factors, individual and family factors, school factors (including the immediate area surrounding schools), and social and physical environmental factors. Safe Routes <b>to</b> <b>School</b> and the Walking School Bus are 2 public health efforts that promote walking and bicycling <b>to</b> <b>school.</b> Although evaluations of these programs are limited, evidence exists that these activities are viewed positively by key stakeholders and have positive effects on children’s active commuting <b>to</b> <b>school.</b> ConclusionFuture efforts <b>to</b> promote walking and bicycling <b>to</b> <b>school</b> will be facilitated by building on current research, combining the strengths of scientific rigor with the predesign and postdesign provided by intervention activities, and disseminating results broadly and rapidly...|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1859, PedroII {{departed}} {{on a trip to}} provinces {{north of}} the capital, visiting Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco and Paraíba. He returned in February 1860 after four months. The trip was a huge success, with the Emperor welcomed everywhere with warmth and joy. The first half of the 1860s saw peace and prosperity in Brazil. Civil liberties were maintained. Freedom of speech had existed since Brazil's independence and was strongly defended by PedroII. He found newspapers from the capital and from the provinces an ideal way to keep track of public opinion and the nation's overall situation. Another means of monitoring the Empire was through direct contacts with his subjects. One opportunity for this was during regular Tuesday and Saturday public audiences, where anyone of any social class, including slaves, could gain admittance and present their petitions and stories. Visits <b>to</b> <b>schools,</b> colleges, prisons, exhibitions, factories, barracks and other public appearances presented further opportunities to gather first-hand information.|$|E
