50|$|An oil shear brake has {{a series}} of {{friction}} discs and steel plates similar to the clutches in an automobile automatic transmission. The shaft carrying the friction discs {{is attached to the}} load through a coupling. A piston pushes the stack of friction discs and steel plates together creating shear in the oil between the discs and plates applying a torque. Torque control can be pneumatic or hydraulic. Force lubrication maintains a film of oil between the surfaces to eliminate wear. Reaction is smooth to zero RPM without stick-slip. Loads up to hundreds of thermal horsepower can be absorbed through the required force lubrication and cooling unit. Most often, the brake is kinetically grounded through a torque arm anchored by a strain gauge which produces a current under load fed to the dynamometer control. Proportional or servo control valves are generally used to allow the dynamometer control to apply pressure to provide the program torque load with feedback from the strain gauge closing the loop. As <b>torque</b> <b>requirements</b> go up there are speed limitations.|$|E
50|$|The Panthers' main {{weakness}} was {{its final}} drive unit. The problems stemmed from several factors. The original MAN proposal {{had called for}} the Panther to have an epicyclic gearing (planetary) system in the final drive, {{similar to that used}} in the Tiger I. Germany suffered from a shortage of gear-cutting machine tools and, unlike the Tiger tanks, the Panther was intended to be mass-produced. To achieve the goal of higher production rates, numerous simplifications were made to the design and its manufacture. This process was aggressively pushed forward, sometimes against the wishes of designers and army officers, by the Chief Director of Armament and War Production, Karl-Otto Saur (who worked under, and later succeeded, Reichminister Speer). Consequently, the final drive was changed to a double spur system. Although much simpler to produce, the double spur gears had inherently higher internal impact and stress loads, making them prone to failure under the high <b>torque</b> <b>requirements</b> of the heavy Panther tank. Because of the significant numbers of breakdowns, the Wehrmacht was forced to move the Panther D and Tiger I tanks by rail, throughout 1943. The tanks could not participate in major movements of more than 100 km without adversely affecting unit strengths due to breakdowns.|$|E

50|$|How {{it works}} - Magnetic {{particles}} (very similar to iron filings) {{are located in}} the powder cavity. When current flows through the coil, the magnetic flux that is created tries to bind the particles together, almost like a magnetic particle slush. As the current is increased, the magnetic field builds, strengthening the binding of the particles. The clutch rotor passes through the bound particles, causing drag between the input and the output during rotation. Depending upon the output <b>torque</b> <b>requirement,</b> the output and input may lock at 100% transfer.|$|R

Sub-optimal steering techniques are defined which reduce the geosynchronous mission <b>torque</b> <b>requirements</b> to acceptable levels with negligible performance penalties.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop an}} analytical model {{that is capable of}} predicting the <b>torque</b> <b>requirements</b> of a rotavator fitted with commercially available L-shaped blades. An analytical approach based on the limit equilibrium analysis was used to develop the proposed model. The proposed model was verified by comparing the model and measured <b>torque</b> <b>requirements</b> at predetermined rotavator blade angular positions from the horizontal for a down-cut rotavator. The study findings indicated that there was an optimum set tillage depth for each rotavator configuration and operational conditions at which the resultant horizontal thrust generated was greatest. This unique depth was influenced by the bite length. The validation of the proposed model showed that the predicted and measured <b>torque</b> <b>requirements,</b> at different angular blade positions from the horizontal, correlated reasonably well for all the set tillage depths. As the depth of tillage increased, however, the curve for the measured <b>torque</b> <b>requirements</b> exhibited a cyclic behaviour after the peak <b>torque</b> <b>requirements</b> value had been recorded. The cyclic behaviour was probably due to the re-tilling and the instability of the tool-frame carrier, which increased with the set tillage depth. The knowledge contributed by this research will afford the designers of active tillage tools {{a better understanding of the}} operations of the rotavator, particularly in deep tillage. The modelling approach, and instrumentation technique used in this research, can be extended to analyze the performance of rotavators fitted with other types of commercial blades.

40|$|ABSTRACT−Narrow {{commuter}} vehicles {{can address}} many congestion, parking and pollution {{issues associated with}} urban transportation. In making narrow vehicles safe, comfortable and acceptable to the public, active tilt control systems are likely to play a crucial role. This paper focuses {{on the development of}} an active direct tilt control system for a narrow vehicle that utilizes an actuator in the vehicle suspension. A simple PD controller can stabilize the tilt dynamics of the vehicle to any desired tilt angle. However, the challenges in the tilt control system design arise in determining the desired lean angle in real-time and in minimizing tilt actuator <b>torque</b> <b>requirements.</b> Minimizing <b>torque</b> <b>requirements</b> requires the tilting and turning of the vehicle to be synchronized as closely as possible. This paper explores two different control design approaches to meet these challenges. A Receding Horizon Controller (RHC) is first developed so as to systematically incorporate preview on road curvature and synchronize tilting with driver initiated turning. Second, a nonlinear control system that utilizes feedback linearization is developed and found to be effective in reducing torque. A close analysis of the complex feedback linearization controller provides insight into which terms are important for reducing actuator effort. This is used to reduce controller complexity and obtain a simple nonlinear controller that provides good performance...|$|E

30|$|The {{prototype}} ankle-foot mechanism {{was designed}} to control the foot in two DOFs. The mechanism uses two identical motors to generate torques in the sagittal plane and in the frontal plane. When both motors rotate in the same direction, they generate DP motion at the foot. IE motion is also generated when the motors move in opposite directions. Sagittal plane <b>torque</b> <b>requirements</b> are larger than the frontal plane <b>torque</b> <b>requirements,</b> and the design benefits from its combined power from both motors to generate DP torques and difference in torques to generate IE torques, instead of using one large motor for DP and one smaller motor for IE. The cable design also allows for placement of the motors at different places on the pylon. This allows the design to be easily adjusted for amputees with different residual limb length or to optimize weight distribution. Additionally, the design may be significantly improved using Bowden cables, allowing the motors and gear boxes to be mechanically decoupled from the pylon and placed elsewhere. This will allow for great flexibility on the design and customization of the prostheses based on individual user needs, especially for amputees with long residual limbs. Also, having the flexibility of placing the motors and gearboxes, which carry {{the most of the}} weight of the mechanism, away from the distal end of tibia would allow for a lightweight prosthesis that in theory can result in more symmetric gait patterns.|$|E

40|$|Project Summary Transportation energy usage is {{predicted}} to increase substantially by 2020. Hybrid vehicles and fuel cell powered vehicles are destined to become more prominent as fuel prices rise with the demand. Hybrid and fuel cell vehicle platforms are both dependent on high performance electric motors. Electric motors for transportation duty will require sizeable low-speed torque to accelerate the vehicle. As motor speed increases, the <b>torque</b> <b>requirement</b> decreases which results in a nearly constant power motor output. Interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSM) are well suited for this duty.,, These rotor geometries are configured in straight lines and semi circular arc shapes. These designs are of limited configurations {{because of the lack}} of availability of permanent magnets of any other shapes at present. We propose to fabricate rotors via a novel processing approach where we start with magnet powders and compact them into a net shape rotor in a single step. Using this approach, widely different rotor designs can be implemented for efficiency. The current limitation on magnet shape and thickness will be eliminated. This is accomplished by co-filling magnet and soft iron powders at specified locations in intricate shapes using specially designed dies and automatic powder filling station. The process fundamentals for accomplishing occurred under a previous Applied Technology Program titled, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂMotors and Generators for the 21 st CenturyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ. New efficient motor designs that are not currently possible (or cost prohibitive) can be accomplished by this approach. Such an approach to motor fabrication opens up a new dimension in motor design. Feasibility Results We were able to optimize a IPMSM rotor to take advantage of the powder co-filling and DMC compaction processing methods. The minimum low speed <b>torque</b> <b>requirement</b> of 5 N-m can be met through an optimized design with magnet material having a Br capability of 0. 2 T. This level of magnetic performance can be met with a variety of bonded magnet compositions. The torque ripple was found to drop significantly by using thinner magnet segments. The powder co-filling and subsequent compaction processing allow for thinner magnet structures to be formed. Torque ripple can be further reduced by using skewing and pole shaping techniques. The techniques can be incorporated into the rotor during the powder co-filling process...|$|R
