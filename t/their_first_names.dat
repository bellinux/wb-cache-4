25|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century it {{was common}} for women, {{especially}} those from a very poor background, not to have a surname and so to be known only by <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names.</b> A woman would then adopt her husband's full surname after marriage. With the advent of republicanism in Brazil and Portugal, along with the institution of civil registries, all children now have surnames.|$|E
25|$|The school {{began in}} the late 1960s as an {{educational}} experiment. The curriculum was unique, varied and highly specialized, following a trimester system, and students were encouraged to address their teachers by <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names</b> and focus on independent learning. The school attracted innovative teachers and self-directed students. Around 1980, with the introduction of a school Disciplinarian, this model gave way to a more traditional, but still high-achieving academic environment.|$|E
2500|$|Like knights, baronets are {{accorded the}} style [...] "Sir" [...] before <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name.</b> Baronetesses in <b>their</b> own right use [...] "Dame", also before <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name,</b> while wives of baronets use [...] "Lady" [...] {{followed}} by the husband's (marital) surname only, this by longstanding courtesy. Wives of baronets are not baronetesses; only women holding baronetcies {{in their own right}} are so styled.|$|R

25|$|The game {{distinguishes between}} {{historical}} and fictional characters with the rollover text that is displayed when the cursor is placed over a character. With {{a few exceptions}} (including ACME agents, V.I.L.E villains, and the peasants in Case 5) characters who have both a first and last name are genuine historical figures, while characters with only a first name or a descriptive title are fictional. However, some of the real historical figures like Queen Elizabeth I and Montezuma are referred to by only <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kees {{was born}} in Beatrice, Nebraska, to John Kees, a {{hardware}} manufacturer, and Sarah Green Kees, a schoolteacher. The Kees family was well-to-do, John Kees being part owner of F.D. Kees Manufacturing Co., which patented and produced corn-husking hooks as well as innovative products such as a window defroster for automobiles and a moving lawn sprinkler that resembled a farm tractor. Weldon Kees was a precocious child whose playmates included Robert Taylor and whose pastimes included producing his own magazines, giving puppet shows and even acting. He was treated like a small adult by his parents, whom he addressed by <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike its predecessor, the {{syndicated}} What's My Line? did not emphasize formality as the panelists dressed in normal attire. In addition, the panelists were simply {{referred to by}} name and only <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names</b> were displayed in front of them. The show did manage to keep some elements of the original series intact, as the intro used during the final two seasons on CBS was reused. The panelists also entered {{in the same manner}} as they had before with Soupy Sales (or the panelist occupying the seat furthest left when he was absent) coming out first and introducing the person sitting next to him, and continuing down the line to Arlene Francis (or whoever occupied her seat while she was absent), who would then introduce the host.|$|E

50|$|Since 1993 {{no one in}} Sweden {{has been}} baptised as Gert {{according}} to the Swedish Bureau of Census, so the name is becoming increasingly rare.

50|$|Börje {{was very}} common {{as a given}} name in 1930-49. Today it is almost never given as a <b>first</b> <b>name</b> {{that is used to}} address the person. In 2017 {{approximately}} 7 500 persons had the <b>name</b> as <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name</b> or name of address.|$|R
25|$|In January 1955 Heseltine began {{articles}} at Peat Marwick & Mitchell. Whilst {{training as}} an accountant, he also {{built up a}} property business in the London property boom of the late 1950s. He and his Oxford roommate Ian Josephs had each inherited around £1,000 (around £23,000 at 2016 prices). They formed a property company called “Michian” (after <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names)</b> and {{with the aid of}} a mortgage bought a 13-year lease on the so-called Thurston Court Hotel at 39, Clanricarde Gardens (near Notting Hill) for £3,750. They evicted the existing tenants so that Josephs’ father could renovate the property and let out the rooms for a total rent of around £30 per week. A year later, they were able to sell the property at a profit, doubling their capital to £4,000.|$|E
500|$|The Sovereign {{is known}} as [...] "His Majesty" [...] or [...] "Her Majesty". The form [...] "Britannic Majesty" [...] appears in {{international}} treaties and on passports to differentiate the British monarch from foreign rulers. The monarch chooses his or her regnal name, not necessarily his or her first name – King George VI, King Edward VII and Queen Victoria did not use <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names.</b>|$|E
500|$|Throughout its run, {{the series}} was led by three (season 5) and four (seasons 1–4, 6) primary cast members, who were {{credited}} by <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names.</b> Its original main cast members were Conrad, Heidi Montag, Audrina Patridge, and Whitney Port. Upon {{the conclusion of the}} fourth season, Port moved to New York City after receiving employment with Diane von Fürstenberg and was commissioned to star in the spin-off The City.|$|E

500|$|Anastasia and {{her older}} sister Maria were known within the family as [...] "The Little Pair". The two girls shared a room, often wore {{variations}} of the same dress, and spent {{much of their time}} together. Their older sisters Olga and Tatiana also shared a room and were known as [...] "The Big Pair". The four girls sometimes signed letters using the nickname OTMA, which was derived from the first letters of <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names.</b>|$|E
500|$|Marion Raven and Marit Larsen {{come from}} Lørenskog in the {{district}} east of Oslo. They became friends at age five, and formed their own band when they were eight. They released a children's album, Synger Kjente Barnesanger, under the band name [...] "Marit & Marion", which {{was nominated for a}} Spellemannprisen award when they were both 12-years-old. They continued writing pop songs and sent demo recordings out. One of the demos ended up at Atlantic Records and they were signed to a worldwide contract in 1998, after which they shortened their name to M2M, which reflects the initials of both <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{actors who}} {{featured}} in the live-action cutscenes and performed the voice work for the original Resident Evil were credited by <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names</b> only.

Valentine was voiced by Catherine Disher in Resident Evil 3; Heidi Anderson in the 2002 remake of Resident Evil, Kathleen Barr in Under the Skin; and Michelle Ruff in the non-canon game [...] Patricia Ja Lee provided the voice and motion capture for Valentine in Resident Evil 5 and the voice for The Umbrella Chronicles.

5000|$|Dutch people quickly {{start calling}} people by <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name.</b> In the Netherlands, a younger person, a child, a relative, a friend, or an {{acquaintance}} are addressed with an informal je/jij ("you"). The formal u {{is used to}} address people one does not know, or is only slightly acquainted with. [...] "U" [...] {{is also used to}} address a higher-ranking business person, although it can soon be replaced by the informal je. When meeting someone in the Netherlands for the first time, they are generally called Sir or Madam, but one will soon be asked to refer to them by <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name.</b> In other countries, it takes much longer for people to associate on a <b>first</b> <b>name</b> basis. There is no special rule that tells how to deal with this: it is safe to follow the lead of the other person. When someone introduces him/herself with just <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name,</b> it is safe to assume that they prefer to be addressed with the informal jij/je.|$|R
500|$|Throughout its run, The Real Housewives of Atlanta {{has been}} led by five (seasons 1–2), six (seasons 3–10 with the {{exception}} of some of season 5), and seven (some of season 5) housewives, who are credited by <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names,</b> and is distinguished within The Real Housewives franchise in that it was, until the introduction of The Real Housewives of Potomac in 2016, the only installment with a predominantly black cast. Its original main housewives were Lisa Wu, DeShawn Snow, NeNe Leakes, Kim Zolciak, and Shereé Whitfield. Snow departed from the program after the first season, and alleged that producers considered her to be [...] "too human for a circus show" [...] and was replaced by Kandi Burruss in the second season.|$|E
500|$|Throughout its run, {{the series}} was led by four (season 2) and five (season 1) primary cast members, who were {{credited}} by <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names.</b> Its original main cast members were Port, Erin Lucas, Jay Lyon, Olivia Palermo, and Adam Senn. Lucas, Lyon, and Senn were replaced by Erin Kaplan and Roxy Olin beginning {{in the second half}} of the first season. The aforementioned women's storylines were largely developed by a number of supporting cast members. Alexandra Crandell was credited as [...] "Adam's girlfriend", while Samantha Swetra was labeled [...] "Whitney's friend". Kelly Cutrone was featured the owner of the PR firm People's Revolution and the employer of Port and Olin, while Joe Zee was credited as Palermo's boss at Elle.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{say that}} {{they did not want to}} force modernity onto the story. There were some {{creative}} challenges, such as the decision to include the sign [...] "221B" [...] on Holmes' front door. Gatiss and Moffat reflect that in the modern world the door would only display the number of the house, and there would be doorbells for each flat. The full house number is so iconic that they felt unable to change it. The writers also decided that the lead characters would address each other by <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names,</b> rather than the traditional Holmes and Watson. This was also reflected in the title of the series. Director Paul McGuigan came up with the idea of putting text messages on the screen instead of having cut-away shots of a hand holding the phone.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, {{there were}} 59,011 men in Sweden with [...] "Kjell" [...] as <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name,</b> {{making it the}} 42nd most common {{masculine}} name in Sweden. In Swedish it is pronounced like [...] "Chell". There were 30,809 men in Norway with [...] "Kjell" [...] as <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name.</b> This makes it the 5th most common masculine name in Norway. In Denmark, 8079 men were called [...] "Kjeld" [...] and 5491 [...] "Keld". In Finland, {{the number of men}} called Kjell in 2008 was 1405.|$|R
25|$|Naturalisation {{of foreigners}} (per Article 47 of the EGBGB).

40|$|To {{determine}} how women in pregnancy {{would like to}} be addressed and to ascertain their preferred choice of title during pregnancy. A questionnaire was administered to 925 antenatal women. Midwifery and medical staff (183) were invited to respond to a similar questionnaire. The response rate was 71. 2 % from the survey of pregnant women. The vast majority (82. 1 %) preferred to be addressed by <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name.</b> Women were in favour of being called ’patient’ (32. 8 %) as <b>their</b> <b>first</b> choice. The staff survey yielded a response rate of 77 %. The majority (81. 8 %) of health professionals preferred to address women by <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name.</b> ’Mother’ (28. 7 %) was the most popular first choice. We conclude that women in pregnancy do have a preference on how they {{would like to be}} addressed and this is predominantly by <b>first</b> <b>name.</b> Health professionals also prefer to call pregnant women by <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name.</b> The term ’patient’ was the most popular first choice of title of women in pregnancy but the term ’mother’ was the preferred choice of the health professionals. Medical staff were more likely to choose ’patient’ than midwives...|$|R
