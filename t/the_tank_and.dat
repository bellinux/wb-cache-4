5|$|Olivia rejoins Henry {{and then}} leaves him to swim {{the rest of}} the way in and make her way to the {{isolation}} tank. After injecting herself with the same drugs Walternate (John Noble) had used on her, she enters <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> soon finds herself back in her own universe. She encounters a cleaning lady, and as Olivia feels herself being dragged back to the parallel universe, she gives the cleaning lady a message to pass along to Peter (Joshua Jackson). Back in the isolation tank, Walternate has had Olivia extracted from <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> directs his agents to lock her up and sedate her.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the costumes}} {{from the film}} had been {{originally}} used in the stage production. Props and set pieces were reused from old Hammer Horror productions and others. <b>The</b> <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> dummy used for Rocky's birth originally appeared in The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958). These references to earlier productions, in addition to cutting costs, enhanced the cult status of the film.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the wood}} {{recovered}} from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of wood in good condition, or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping the wood in heated tanks in a solution of polyethylene glycol and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing {{the water in the}} wood with the wax over a period of about nine months. After this treatment the wood was removed from <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> wiped clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.|$|E

5|$|GoldenEye was {{the last}} film of special effects {{supervisor}} Derek Meddings, to whom the film was dedicated. Meddings' major contribution was miniatures. It {{was also the first}} Bond film to use computer generated imagery. Among the model effects are most external shots of Severnaya, the scene where Janus' train crashes into <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> <b>and</b> the lake which hides the satellite dish, since the producers could not find a round lake in Puerto Rico. The climax in the satellite dish used scenes in Arecibo, a model built by Meddings' team and scenes shot with stuntmen in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Nagore dargah is {{a common}} place of worship for devotees of various {{religious}} faiths. According to {{the administration of the}} dargah, about 50–75 per cent of pilgrims visiting the dargah everyday are Hindus. The practise of offering flowers, sweetmeats and food, the way of conducting worship, and playing musical instruments like nadaswaram (a type of pipe instrument commonly used in Tamil Nadu) are atypical of Hindu tradition. Other worship practises include offering flags and lighting lamps of ghee at the saint's tomb. Devotees shave their heads near <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> offer tin or silver-plated facsimiles of body parts, houses, sailboats matching their material needs.|$|E
5|$|World War I was {{the most}} devastating in British {{military}} history, with nearly 800,000 men killed and over twomillion wounded. Early in the war, the BEF was virtually destroyed and was replaced first by volunteers and then a conscript force. Major battles included those at the Somme and Passchendaele. Advances in technology saw the advent of <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> (<b>and</b> {{the creation of the}} Royal Tank Regiment) and advances in aircraft design (including the creation of the Royal Flying Corps) which would be decisive in future battles. Trench warfare dominated Western Front strategy for most of the war, and the use of chemical weapons (disabling and poison gases) added to the devastation.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Nemo {{is placed}} in a fish tank {{in the office of}} a dentist. He meets {{aquarium}} fish called the Tank Gang, led by Gill, a moorish idol. The fish learn that Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece, Darla, who previously killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag. Gill then reveals his plan to escape, jamming the tank's filter with a pebble. The fish would be placed in plastic bags so that the dentist can clean <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> <b>and</b> then they would roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to jam the filter, but fails, almost getting himself killed in the process. Near the harbor, a pelican, Nigel, flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's adventure. Inspired by his father's determination, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam the filter. Unlike the first attempt, he is able to successfully render the filter useless, but to the tank gang's dismay, the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape.|$|E
5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a few yards away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E
5|$|West Nohno {{had made}} her way to Hampton Roads, Virginia, by 29 May, when she sailed for Key West, Florida. After her 4 June arrival at Key West, she began a nine-month journey to Alexandria, Cairo, and other ports. During this {{extended}} voyage, three crewmen entered one of West Nohnos fuel tanks to clean it while the ship was at Suez on 29 September 1942. The crewmen did not use gas masks and were soon overcome by fumes. The second mate of the Norwegian tanker Britannia, Henning Vaagsnes, entered <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> removed all three men. Two of West Nohnos men survived but the third, despite two hours of attempts to revive him by Vaagsnes, did not. For his efforts, Vaagsnes received a pair of binoculars from U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt and a gold watch from the ship owners. He was also awarded St. Olav's medal with Oak Branch, a medal awarded for personal courage and bravery by the Norwegian government.|$|E

5|$|Jason X (2001) {{takes place}} in the future, when Jason has again been inexplicably resurrected. A scientist, Rowan Lafontaine (Lexa Doig), decides that cryonic {{suspension}} is the only method of stopping him, but Jason breaks free and kills the army personnel guarding him before he can be again imprisoned. Rowan manages to lure Jason into the cryo‑chamber, but he ruptures <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> freezes both himself and Rowan. Over 400 years later, a team of students studying Earth discover Jason's body and take it into space. Upon being thawed by the team, he proceeds to murder everyone aboard the spacecraft. He is seemingly killed, but is then resurrected via nanotechnology as a cyborg version of himself. Finally, he is ejected into space and incinerated by Earth Two's atmosphere, his mask falling to the bottom of a lake. The next Friday the 13th film, Freddy vs. Jason (2003), was a crossover with A Nightmare on Elm Street. Set in the contemporary period, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) resurrects Jason (Ken Kirzinger) and sends him to Springwood hoping that he will create enough fear among the residents that Freddy will be strong enough to invade their dreams. Jason accomplishes this but refuses to stop killing. A battle ensues both in the dream-world and at Crystal Lake. The outcome is left ambiguous, as Jason surfaces from the lake holding Freddy's severed head, which winks and laughs.|$|E
5|$|The Tank, Light, Mk VIII (A25), {{also known}} as the Harry Hopkins, after American President Roosevelt's chief {{diplomatic}} advisor, was a British light tank produced by Vickers-Armstrong during the Second World War. The Mk VIII was the last in the line of light tanks the company had built for the British Army, and was intended to be the successor of the previous light tank designed by Vickers-Armstrong, the Mk VII Tetrarch. A number of changes were made to the Mk VIII, most notably increasing its width, length and weight and also increasing the thickness of the armour. The design of the tank was submitted to the War Office in late 1941, with an initial order for 1,000 models being made by the Tank Board of the War Office in the same month, a number that increased to 2,410 in November. Production began in June 1942 but immediately began encountering problems with <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> <b>and</b> a number of modifications had to be made to the design after complaints were made by the War Office and the Fighting Vehicle Proving Establishment. These problems were so acute that only 6 tanks had been produced by mid-1943, and only 100 when production ended in February 1945.|$|E
25|$|On 9 April 1940, {{when the}} Germans invaded Norway, <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> the three {{armoured}} cars were {{stored in the}} depot of Dragoon Regiment 1 at Gardermoen. When Dragoon Regiment 1 finished its mobilization at 03:00 on 10 April and moved out to oppose the invading German forces they left both <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> the armoured cars behind. <b>The</b> <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> the armoured cars were captured by the advancing Germans and disappeared from records, after having been a popular object for souvenir photos for German troops at Gardermoen in May 1940.|$|E

5000|$|The Red Army Mechanized {{infantry}} tactics {{during the}} 1950s {{were similar to}} World War II methods in which APCs were used as [...] "battle taxis"; they would keep the infantry {{in close proximity to}} the battle-tanks during movement, but on enemy contact they would unload their infantry before retreating to safer areas. This was in contrast to the German doctrine of infantry fighting vehicles manifested in the Schützenpanzer Lang HS.30, where the vehicles were supposed to stay with <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> engage lighter targets, both to take a burden off <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> to support their infantry squads.|$|R

25|$|According to Forty, Ordnance {{recommended}} that 1,500 of the T26E1 be built. The Armored Force recommended only 500. The AGF rejected the 90mm version of <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> <b>and</b> {{wanted it to}} be built with the 76mm gun instead. Somehow, Ordnance managed to get production of the T26E1 started in November 1944. Forty primarily quoted from a post-war report from the Ordnance Dept.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the number}} of German {{communication}} trenches, sap heads, crater posts, detached posts and subsidiary trenches in the area, <b>the</b> second wave <b>tanks</b> were given specific German positions, routes and positions in villages to deal with, as well as attacking the main Hindenburg trenches. Infantry were to follow [...] behind, to attack trenches {{as soon as they were}} engaged by <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> mark gaps in <b>the</b> wire; each <b>tank</b> carried spare ammunition for the infantry. Training in the 51st and 62nd divisions departed from the [...] "Notes" [...] issued by <b>the</b> <b>Tank</b> Corps, by having infantry keep a greater distance from <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> moving in lines rather than files, along with the use of Rovers ahead of <b>the</b> Fighting <b>Tanks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The livery of the M {{class was}} the NSR's Madder lake with straw lining, and NORTH STAFFORD {{lettering}} on <b>the</b> side <b>tanks</b> along with <b>the</b> company crest.

In LMS days all received the crimson lake passenger livery of the early LMS with large numerals on <b>the</b> side <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> company crest on the bunker, but by 1928 they were repainted in plain black with L M S written on <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> number on <b>the</b> bunker.|$|R
