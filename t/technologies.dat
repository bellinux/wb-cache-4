5|$|Active solar {{techniques}} use photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, {{solar thermal}} collectors, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing {{the position of}} a building to the Sun. Active solar <b>technologies</b> increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side <b>technologies,</b> while passive solar <b>technologies</b> reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side <b>technologies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from eastern Africa {{extending from the}} Rift Valley from Ethiopia to northern Tanzania represents the largest archaeological evidence of the shift from the Late Acheulian to the Middle Stone Age tool <b>technologies.</b> This transition is characterized by stratigraphic layering of Acheulian stone tools, a bifacial handaxe technology, underneath and even contemporaneous with MSA <b>technologies,</b> such as Levallois tools, flakes, flaked tools, pointed flakes, smaller bifaces that are projectile in form, and, on rare occasions, hafted tools. Evidence of the gradual displacement of Acheulian by MSA <b>technologies</b> is further supported by this layering and contemporaneous placement, {{as well as by}} the earliest appearance of MSA <b>technologies</b> at Gademotta and the latest Acheulian <b>technologies</b> at the Bouri Formation of Ethiopia, dated to 154 to 160 kya. This suggests a possible overlap of 100-150 thousand years.|$|E
