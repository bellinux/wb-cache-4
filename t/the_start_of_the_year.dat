5|$|In 1988, an enquiry {{investigated}} the Fremantle Prison riot that occurred at <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> The report suggested that little evidence supported the escape plan theory {{reported by the}} media, but that the riot was largely {{the result of an}} incident of that morning involving the mistreatment of a prisoner and his subsequent release into Three Division yard.|$|E

In the semi-finals against China, Lee was defeated by Lin Dan, which ended his 18-match unbeaten record since <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Rhodes scored over 1,000 runs in {{the season}} for the first time, in the process {{completing}} his first double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets. However, after bowling {{a large number of}} overs against Worcestershire early in the season, he had little success as a bowler for a spell of three weeks. Pelham Warner, a leading amateur cricketer and later captain of England, noted that Rhodes was comparatively unsuccessful at <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> but came back well to take 193 wickets. Warner wrote that Rhodes at this time was accused of being easy to face on a wicket which suited the batsmen, although Warner himself did not agree.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool Data Research Associates (LDRA) {{were called}} in to {{investigate}} allegations of cheating using banned driving aids, such as traction control and launch control, both prohibited at <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> The top three cars of Michael Schumacher, Nicola Larini and Mika Häkkinen were investigated and their teams were asked to surrender their systems' source code to the company. Larini's team, Ferrari, complied in light of allegations that they were cheating, but Schumacher and Häkkinen's teams, Benetton and McLaren refused, claiming copyright reasons. After being fined $100,000 by the FIA, both teams complied eight days after the race. LDRA discovered that McLaren were running a programme that permitted automatic gearshifts but the car was declared legal.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{interest}} in the 1886 season concerned the newly inaugurated Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in July, which offered a then record prize of £10,000. From <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> St. Gatien was seen {{as one of the}} leading contenders for the new race together with Bendigo and Minting. For the second year in succession, St. Gatien's spring preparation was disrupted, this time by injury, although he was able to resume his training in time for Royal Ascot. It was reported that St. Gatien had been defeated by Melton in a private trial race in early 1886, but there are few details and it is unclear whether or not this was a serious contest.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{assigned}} the pennant number L134 during 1973. At <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> Sydney was marked {{for a potential}} deployment to Mururoa {{in support of a}} Royal New Zealand Navy frigate sent to protest French nuclear testing at the atoll. The former carrier was chosen as she was capable of replenishing smaller vessels, and the RAN's dedicated replenishment oiler, , was undergoing refits. The Australian government did not want to send a warship until all other avenues of protest had been exhausted; the length of this delay meant Supplys refit was finished before Sydney was deployed, and the oiler was sent instead. Sydney visited Singapore in March, returned to Australia, and sailed to New Zealand in April: she participated in training exercises during both visits. The troopship was then involved in a joint warfare exercise in Jervis Bay during May.|$|E
5|$|By 1965, the Americans {{were looking}} for someone to {{overthrow}} Khánh, and these efforts were spearheaded by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, who had begun encouraging other senior officers to move against Khánh since <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> even though there was still significant hesitation and opposition to any regime change back in Washington. At the time, the US was planning to start a large-scale bombing campaign against the communist north and regarded Khánh's reliance on Buddhist support as an obstacle to their aims. Furthermore, Taylor and Khánh developed an intense personal antipathy for one another, which culminated in a breakdown in their relationship; in December 1964, Khánh's junta deposed the High National Council, a civilian advisory body that was designed to give a semblance of civilian rule. This resulted in Taylor angrily condemning Khánh and his generals in private to the point of suggesting Khánh resign the leadership. Khánh responded by threatening to expel Taylor, and going on a media offensive against the ambassador. Taylor threatened to withhold military aid, but the Americans could not do so because of their overriding desire to see the military defeat of the communists, and without foreign funding, South Vietnam could not survive.|$|E
5|$|The Matriculation exam tested {{candidates}} on five subjects: Latin, Greek, Mathematics, Science, and English Literature. By exam-time this dedication to his studies had paid off spectacularly; the 1887 Cape lists placed Jan third overall, {{with the highest}} marks in the Colony in Greek. In what had been by any standards a year of tremendous success the latter achievement was especially outstanding; a misunderstanding at <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> led Jan {{to believe that he}} would be exempted from the Greek exam – as a result it was a subject which he largely disregarded. Six days before the exam this potentially devastating oversight was exposed – there was now less than a week in which to catch up with a year’s study. Jan immediately shut himself away in his rooms, spending the next days in total seclusion, working from sunrise to sunset in the attempt to master the grammar and vocabulary upon which he was shortly to be tested. By the time of the exam this hard work had paid off. Within a relatively short period Jan had largely memorised his books and had mastered the Greek language to a remarkable degree.|$|E
