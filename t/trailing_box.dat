50|$|The M1931 {{was one of}} {{the first}} Soviet {{artillery}} pieces to feature split trail carriage. This carriage construction allowed for much better traverse angles compared to earlier single <b>trail</b> or <b>box</b> <b>trail</b> carriages. Good elevation angle and ability to use different propellant charges made the gun flexible indirect fire weapon, and its ballistics were powerful enough to make it useful in direct fire role against enemy armor (though, as mentioned above, it was not an ideal anti-tank gun because of its size, traverse speed and rate of fire).|$|R

50|$|It is {{characterized}} by a very short barrel, <b>box</b> <b>trail,</b> and large wooden wheels. It has an interrupted thread type breech block and hydro-spring recoil-mechanism. No shield is used with this weapon.|$|R
50|$|The Type 38 105mm Field Gun was a {{conventional}} design, with crew {{seats on the}} gun shield and a solid <b>box</b> <b>trail.</b> It had a hydrospring recoil system, interrupted screw type breechblock, and 1/16-inch gun shield.|$|R
50|$|The Type 4 is {{the first}} Japanese weapon to replace the hydrospring recoil system with the hydropneumatic. Its {{modified}} <b>box</b> <b>trail</b> allows it to fire at extreme elevations, increasing its usefulness in jungle or rugged terrain.|$|R
5000|$|Dale's Trail: This trail can be {{accessed}} from either Ice <b>Box</b> <b>Trail</b> or Pine Creek Trail. It follows the terrain {{at the base of}} the escarpment and connects the two above mentioned trails. (4. 4 mile round trip, moderate).|$|R
25|$|The Type 38 75mm Field Gun was a {{thoroughly}} conventional design for its day, complete with crew {{seats on the}} gun shield and a solid <b>box</b> <b>trail.</b> It had a hydrospring recoil system, interrupted screw type breechblock, and 1/16-inch gun shield.|$|R
50|$|Both {{references}} {{listed below}} believe this gun {{was developed in}} the 1930s, but this seems unlikely given the photographic evidence of the designation as modello 18. The <b>box</b> <b>trail</b> would also be very old-fashioned for a gun designed that late.|$|R
5000|$|The pack {{howitzer}} carriage M1 had dismantling construction. The carriage was of <b>box</b> <b>trail</b> type, with steel-rimmed wooden wheels. For transportation, the howitzer M1 or M1A1 on carriage M1 {{could be}} broken down into six mule loads, with payload weight between 73 and 107 kg each: ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>box</b> <b>trail</b> {{carriage}} {{was nearly}} identical {{to that of the}} M1910. It had either unsprung wooden wheels or metal wheels with solid rubber tires. With wooden wheels, the speed of transportation was limited to about 6 km/h. A team of eight horses was needed to tow the gun; another six towed an ammunition box with 42 rounds.|$|R
50|$|The gun had {{monobloc}} barrel {{fitted with}} horizontal sliding breech. The recoil system consisted of hydraulic compressor and hydropneumatic recuperator, both {{mounted in the}} gun cradle. The recoil length was fixed. The carriage was of <b>box</b> <b>trail</b> type, with equilibrator, suspension and a folding spade. Metal wheels had removable rubber tires. The gun was equipped with a shield.|$|R
5000|$|The Type 38 75 mm Field Gun was a {{thoroughly}} conventional design for its day, complete with crew {{seats on the}} gun shield and a solid <b>box</b> <b>trail.</b> It had a hydrospring recoil system, interrupted screw type breechblock, and 1/16-inch gun shield.At some point prior to the Second Sino-Japanese War (sources differ as to when) the Type 38 was extensively modified. The piece was trunnioned forward and equilibrators were added to compensate for muzzle heaviness. It was given a hollow <b>box</b> <b>trail</b> that allowed elevation to 43°. The new version was called the [...] "Improved Type 38". Some 400 units were produced in Japan, and it is unclear exactly how many Type 38s were upgraded to the improved version. However, both types were still in service in limited numbers {{by the start of}} World War II, despite efforts to replace the design with the Type 90 75 mm Field Gun.|$|R
25|$|The Type 38 150mm Howitzer was a {{conventional}} design for its day, complete with crew {{seats on the}} gun shield and a solid <b>box</b> <b>trail.</b> It had a hydrospring recoil system, interrupted screw type breechblock, and 1/16-inch gun shield. It {{was designed to be}} moved by a team of eight horses, but in practice, its heavy weight was a problem.|$|R
50|$|The major variant was the Mark IV gun on Mk IV {{carriage}}. The Mk IV gun started {{testing in}} 1916 {{mounted on a}} new Mk III carriage with <b>box</b> <b>trail.</b> This eliminated the original central pole trail, which had restricted elevation, allowing increased elevation to 37.5 degrees and hence increased maximum range from 6525 to 9300 yards with the 2 charge shell.|$|R
50|$|Intended {{to replace}} the various Austro-Hungarian heavy {{howitzer}} that the Czechs had inherited, they began a program {{to develop a new}} howitzer shortly after achieving independence in 1919. It didn't reflect many of the lessons of World War I as it retained a <b>box</b> <b>trail</b> and wooden wheels suitable only for horse traction. Its carriage broke down into two loads for transport. It fired a 42 kg shell.|$|R
50|$|It was {{originally}} designed to be towed by horses with wooden-spoked wheels. Some weapons may have been modernized for tractor-towing with steel-spoked wheels and pneumatic tires. For transport the <b>box</b> <b>trail</b> {{was supported by a}} small limber. Howitzers captured by the Germans after the Italian surrender in 1943 were given the designation of 10.5 cm leichte Feldhaubitze 326(i), although it is unknown to what extent they were actually used.|$|R
40|$|The lack of {{suitable}} nest sites {{may be a}} {{limiting factor}} for Western Bluebird populations inhabiting the upper Willamette Valley. Nest <b>box</b> <b>trails</b> have been established on the hills surrounding the Portland metropolitan area. Since their placement, approximately 25 % of the boxes available {{have been used by}} Western Bluebirds as nest cavities. This study was undertaken to identify factors which might determine the selection of a nest box by Western Bluebirds and the subsequent nest success or failure. The breeding biology of Western Bluebirds using the nest <b>box</b> <b>trail</b> located on Parrett Mountain, Oregon in 1979 was investigated. Breeding season, mean clutch size, average incubation and nestling periods, and level of nest success were determined. Nest box dimensions, placement, and surrounding habitat features were quantified. Potentially important nest site characteristics were examined and tested for association with Western Bluebird nest box use and reproductive success. Western Bluebird nest box selection was random with regard to all of the characteristics studied except Solar Index and Nest Box Density. No correlation was seen between nest box characteristics and bluebird nest success...|$|R
5000|$|Bryan Gibson (born November 10, 1947 in Kentville, Nova Scotia) is {{a retired}} boxer from Canada, who {{represented}} his native country at the 1976 Summer Olympics, and is the first boxer of African descent from Nova Scotia (and possibly all of Canada) {{to compete in the}} Olympics. There he was defeated {{in the first round of}} the men's middleweight division ( [...] - [...] 75 kilograms) by East Germany's Bernd Wittenburg. He now coaches the Evangaline <b>Trail</b> Amateur <b>Boxing</b> Club in Kentville, Nova Scotia (his hometown). He has coached a variety of amateur boxers including some amateur national champions and a gold medallist at the most recent Canada Games. He is also a bus driver for the Annapolis Valley Regional School Board in Nova Scotia, Canada.|$|R
50|$|The {{area was}} {{extensively}} logged {{in the late}} 19th to the mid-20th century. Although logging still continues on a smaller scale, the reserve was created in 1971 to provide outdoor recreation opportunities while favouring wildlife conservation. In harmony with its mandate to ensure the sustainability of resources and to foster the rational use of its territory, the reserve pursues wildlife and fish development activities by setting up spawning grounds, tree groves, interpretation <b>trails,</b> and nesting <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The K 16 was a {{thoroughly}} conventional design for its {{day with a}} <b>box</b> <b>trail,</b> steel wheels for motor transport and a curved gunshield. The axle was suspended on a traverse leaf spring. For transport the barrel was generally detached from the recoil system and moved on its own trailer. In 1941 {{a small number of}} K 16 barrels were placed on 21 cm Mrs 18 carriages to become the 15 cm K 16 in Mrs Laf.|$|R
25|$|The Mk II gun {{introduced}} from 1918 had {{a longer}} barrel, new <b>box</b> <b>trail</b> carriage giving increased elevation to 35 degrees and cut-off gear to automatically reduce the recoil length from 54 to 24inches with increasing elevation, hydro-pneumatic recoil system below the barrel, single-motion Asbury breech. It arrived {{too late to}} see service in the First World War and was effectively a new weapon. The gun {{was one of two}} types that could be carried by the Gun Carrier Mark I.|$|R
50|$|The leading and {{trailing}} {{carrying wheels}} were fitted in F.W. Webb-type radial axleboxes. Webb's arrangement {{consisted of two}} radial axle boxes joined by a curved casting, so that they moved in unison between curved steel plates bolted to the main frame. A bogie check spring, having a single spiral spring, was enclosed in a box secured to the curved plates. The arcs of the leading and <b>trailing</b> radial axle <b>boxes</b> were struck from a centre midway between the coupled wheels.|$|R
50|$|The light gun {{appears to}} owe {{a number of}} its {{features}} to the QF 25 pounder, unsurprisingly since RARDE was the successor to the design department, Woolwich Arsenal. Among these features are its vertically sliding block breech, and a <b>box</b> <b>trail</b> instead of a split trail; a traversing platform is normally used with it. Its comparatively light weight is also attributed {{to the nature of}} the steel used in the carriage and ordnance, and other weight-reducing features, including its narrow wheelbase.|$|R
50|$|As {{the full}} company name (Rohrbach Metall-Flugzeugbau) makes clear, all Rohrbach {{aircraft}} were all-metal, including their duralumin skinning. The Robbe was a monoplane {{with a high}} wing described {{at the time as}} a semi-cantilever structure, meaning that there were no rigid wing struts but that it retained external bracing with flying wires to the wings from the lower fuselage. The wings were mounted with 5° of dihedral. In plan they were straight tapered, with unswept leading edges and blunt tips. Internally the wings were built around single box spars, assisted by leading edge and <b>trailing</b> edge <b>boxes.</b> The edge boxes also served as fuel tanks. At this time there were still doubts about the repairability of metal aircraft, so the Robbe's two-part wing was designed to be easy to inspect internally by the removal of the edge boxes and all parts were replaceable. The wing skin was riveted to the ribs.|$|R
25|$|The 60 pounder {{was a heavy}} field gun or ‘gun of position’ {{designed}} to be towed by either a horse team or mechanical vehicle. It had a quick firing recoil, meaning that the carriage did not move when the gun fired. The barrel was a wire wound A tube in a jacket with a screw breech. It fired a separate round (i.e. shell and bagged cartridge were loaded separately). The lower carriage comprised a <b>box</b> <b>trail.</b> It was designed for one-man laying with both traverse and elevation sights and controls on the left.|$|R
2500|$|The limber <b>box</b> (<b>trail</b> chest) held 9 {{round shot}} while the caisson carried an {{additional}} 48-round shot and 20 canister shot. Of the canister shot, 12 were larger rounds with 41 large projectiles while eight were smaller rounds with 112 small projectiles. A single 12-pounder had three ammunition wagons each holding 68 rounds. The canister round was propelled by [...] of gunpowder while the round shot charge contained [...] of gunpowder. The maximum {{range of the}} 12-pounder was [...] The effective range was [...] for shot and [...] for canister.|$|R
50|$|In 1934, the Italian firm of Ansaldo {{produced}} a new mountain howitzer design, the Obice da 75/18 modello 34, designed by Lt. Colonel Sergio Berlese {{who served in}} the Italian artillery. The modello 34 could be broken down into eight loads for transport. In the interest of standardization and logistics a version of the 75/18, the modello 35, was also used as the light howitzer component of normal field batteries. The modello 35 did not break down into smaller loads and had a split, rather than <b>box,</b> <b>trail.</b>|$|R
