50|$|<b>Threadfins</b> {{frequent}} open, {{shallow water}} {{in areas with}} muddy, sandy, or silty bottoms; they are rarely seen at reefs. Their pectoral rays are thought to serve as tactile structures, helping to find prey within the sediments. Noted for being euryhaline, <b>threadfins</b> are able to tolerate {{a wide range of}} salinity levels. This attribute allows <b>threadfins</b> to enter estuaries and even rivers.

25|$|The <b>threadfin</b> jack is of some {{importance}} to fisheries throughout its range, although individual catch {{statistics for the}} species are not kept. It is often caught by hook-and-line methods or by gill nets and various artisanal traps. It {{is considered to be}} good to excellent table fare, and is marketed both fresh and salted. The species has also been found at a number of archaeological sites in both Panama and Ecuador, indicating it has been caught by humans for food for at least 3450 years. The <b>threadfin</b> jack is also of interest to anglers who catch the species occasionally, and is considered a minor gamefish. Juveniles are occasionally caught from shore, such as piers and breakwaters, while larger individuals are caught over deeper reefs. The species takes a variety of bait, including fish and prawns, but they also take lures, including hard and small, fly-like Sabiki lures.|$|E
25|$|Much {{of biology}} and {{ecology of the}} <b>threadfin</b> jack is unknown, with the species' diet the only studied aspect of its biology. A study in fishes of the {{continental}} shelf of Colombia found the species takes predominantly small, benthic fishes of the families Triglidae, Synodontidae, and Batrachoididae. Other common prey included benthic crustaceans, including various crabs and shrimp.|$|E
25|$|Filter feeders {{strain the}} water column indiscriminately for small prey, {{typically}} phyto- and zooplankton. This category of fishes includes <b>threadfin</b> shad (Dorosoma petenense), American shad (Alosa sapidissima), inland silversides (Menidia beryllina), and anchovies (Engraulis mordax). Some evidence suggests {{that some of these}} species are food-limited due to the depressed levels of plankton after the introduction of the Amur River clam. Anchovies have left the LSZ in favor of more productive regions of the estuary in the San Pablo and Central Bays.|$|E

25|$|In life, the <b>threadfin</b> jack is a silvery-blue above, {{becoming}} silvery-white on the underside, {{with golden}} to yellow reflections. The first dorsal and pelvic fin is grey, {{while the second}} dorsal, anal, pectoral, and caudal fins are hyaline or grey with a yellow tinge. Juveniles have clear, dark, vertical bands, fading with age. Much like the shadow trevally, small black spots occur on the bases of soft dorsal rays and the body immediately below them that increase in size with age, with a small black blotch on the upper operculum.|$|E
25|$|The <b>threadfin</b> jack is {{distributed}} throughout the tropical regions of the eastern Pacific Ocean, inhabiting the western coast of the Americas. The northern limit to the species range is southern Baja California, with its range extending south to Mexico and Central America to a southern limit of Ecuador, with the species also recorded from the Galapagos Islands.

25|$|The African pompano (Alectis ciliaris) (also {{known as}} the pennant-fish and <b>threadfin</b> trevally) is a widely {{distributed}} species of tropical marine fish in the jack family, Carangidae. The species is found in tropical waters worldwide, with adults often inhabiting coastlines, while juveniles are usually pelagic, floating with ocean currents. The adult African pompano is similar in appearance to {{the other members of}} the genus Alectis, with the concave shape of the head near the eyes the clearest distinguishing feature. The juveniles are similar to other members of Alectis, having long, filamentous dorsal and anal fin tips which are thought to discourage predators. The species lives in depths less than 100 m, consuming a range of crustaceans and small fishes. The species is of minor economic importance, often taken amongst other tropical midwater fishes by hook and line, while juveniles are occasionally caught in beach seines. African pompano are also highly rated game fish, often considered one of the strongest of the jacks in larger sizes.|$|E

25|$|As {{defined by}} the World Wildlife Fund, the San Joaquin River {{watershed}} {{is part of the}} Sacramento-San Joaquin freshwater ecoregion, which supports almost 40 species of freshwater fish. These include several types of lampreys, sturgeons, sunfish, perch and various anadromous fish species such as salmon and steelhead. Some of these fish are believed to have descended from fishes of the Columbia Basin in geologically ancient times, when {{the upper reaches of the}} Sacramento River watershed were connected with that of the Snake River. Up to 75 percent of the historic species were endemic to the Sacramento-San Joaquin basin. Most native fish stocks have suffered because of predation by introduced species and dam construction. In a study from 1993 to 1995, it was found that the main stem of the San Joaquin River was mainly populated by fathead minnow, red shiner, <b>threadfin</b> shad and inland silverside, all of which were introduced. Downstream portions of the river's main tributaries were populated mainly by largemouth and smallmouth bass, redear sunfish and white catfish, while native species have survived relatively well in the upper reaches of the river and its tributaries, which also play host to introduced brown trout.|$|E
500|$|The {{bald eagle}} is an {{opportunistic}} carnivore {{with the capacity}} to consume {{a great variety of}} prey. Throughout their range, fish often comprise the majority of the eagle's diet. In 20 food habit studies across the species' range, fish comprised 56% of the diet of nesting eagles, birds 28%, mammals 14% and other prey 2%. In Southeast Alaska, fish comprise approximately 66% of the year-around diet of bald eagles and 78% of the prey brought to the nest by the parents. Eagles living in the Columbia River Estuary in Oregon were found to rely on fish for 90% of their dietary intake. In the Pacific Northwest, spawning trout and salmon provide most of the bald eagles' diet from late summer throughout fall. Southeast Alaskan eagles largely prey on pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), coho salmon (O. kisutch) and, more locally, sockeye salmon (O. nerka), with chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), due to their large size ( [...] average adult size) probably being taken only as carrion. Also important in the estuaries and shallow coastlines of southern Alaska are Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus). In Oregon's Columbia River Estuary, the most significant prey species were largescale suckers (Catostomus macrocheilus) (17.3% of the prey selected there), American shad (Alosa sapidissima; 13%) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio; 10.8%). Eagles living in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland were found to subsist largely on American gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), <b>threadfin</b> shad (D. petenense) and white bass (Morone chrysops). Floridian eagles have been reported to prey on catfish, most prevalently the brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) and any species in the Ictalurus genus as well as mullet, trout, needlefish, and eels. Wintering eagles on the Platte River in Nebraska preyed mainly on American gizzard shads and common carp. From observation in the Columbia River, 58% of the fish were caught live by the eagle, 24% were scavenged as carcasses and 18% were pirated away from other animals.|$|E

The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide.

2500|$|The <b>threadfin</b> jack or thread pompano, Carangoides otrynter, is {{a species}} of coastal marine fish in the jack family Carangidae.

It is a moderately large fish, growing to [...] and may be recognized by its filamentous dorsal and anal fin lobes. The <b>threadfin</b> jack inhabits both deeper coastal waters and inshore environments, including reefs and estuaries, where it preys on minute benthic and pelagic organisms, including small fishes and crustaceans.

The <b>threadfin</b> jack is of importance to fisheries throughout its distribution, caught by hook-and-line and net methods and marketed fresh and salted, and is considered a very good table fish.
