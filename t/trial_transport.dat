40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the maximum time of emersion of Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) specimens to {{form the basis for}} a dry sole transport procedure. For this purpose, 56 specimens (922. 33 29. 52 g body weight) were individually placed in polystyrene boxes on a wet cloth, maintaining constant temperature (15 °C) during emersion trial. Specimens (n = 7 per group) were sampled for plasma, and mortality was monitored at different points (0, 2, 6, 12, 20, 28, 36 and 44 h of emersion), and several tress (cortisol, glucose and lactate) and metabolic (triglycerides, proteins and amino acids) parameters were assessed. After sampling, each experimental group was placed in recovery tanks for the assessment of delayed mortality and feeding performance after emersion <b>trial.</b> <b>Transport</b> periods longer than 28 h produced high stress level indicated by (i) significant increase in circulating cortisol and lactate and (ii) glucose reserves mobilization. These alterations originated physiological problems during the emersion trial that induced mortality as well as problems for recovering correct feeding performance of specimens.

40|$|Poor produce {{quality and}} {{inconsistent}} supply currently impede smallholder vegetable growers in Fiji from accessing high-value domestic markets. One proposed option {{to overcome these}} constraints is to adopt a more centralised approach to product grading and storage, based around a network of regional ripening and packaging facilities. In terms of tomato growers, this would necessitate reconfiguring existing postharvest supply chains, removing the need for on-farm ripening, and transport of harvest-green mature fruit. This preliminary study was undertaken {{to determine whether the}} alternative transport of mature hard-green fruit would affect the incidence of bruising and impact damage. Fruits of four ripening stages were commercially transported to Suva municipal market, and then stored for seven days at 20 - 28 °C (ambient market storage conditions). Fruit deformation due to compression in the carton was significantly less in mature-hard green fruits. We found that mature hard-green stage was least susceptible to bruising (8 %) compared with turning stage tomatoes (12 %), commercially traded fruit (16 %) and light-red (21 %). For mature green tomatoes most damage (36 %) was in the middle inner level of the carton. Light red and turning tomatoes placed in the bottom inside layer displayed highest level of damage, 62 and 46 % respectively. Based on this preliminary <b>trial,</b> <b>transporting</b> hardgreen tomatoes is likely {{to reduce the risk of}} in-transit postharvest damage, compared to the current smallholder practices of transporting fully-ripe fruit...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} traits for nanoparticle delivery systems is that they must be biodegradable on the scale of a few days. A few common polymer materials used for drug delivery studies are polybutyl cyanoacrylate (PBCA), poly(isohexyl cyanoacrylate) (PIHCA), polylactic acid (PLA), or polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA). Human serum albumin (HSA) and chitosan are also materials of interest. PBCA undergoes degradation through enzymatic cleavage of its ester bond on the alkyl side chain to produce water-soluble byproducts. PBCA also proves to be the fastest biodegradable material, with studies showing 80% reduction after 24 hours post intravenous therapy injection. PIHCA, however, was recently found to display an even lower degradation rate, which in turn further decreases toxicity. PIHCA, due to this slight advantage, is currently undergoing phase III clinical <b>trials</b> for <b>transporting</b> the drug doxorubicin as a treatment for hepatocellular carcinomas.|$|R
40|$|Background Evidence-based {{public health}} {{requires}} research to support policy. There {{is a large}} amount of literature on strategies for knowledge translation or more discursive knowledge exchange. However, little evidence exists for their effectiveness and underlying mechanisms, especially with regard to multisectoral, multidisciplinary evidence in knowledge mobilisation. Taking the opportunity of a knowledge exchange forum {{at the end of a}} natural experimental study, we investigated how stakeholders assess, negotiate, and use multisectoral evidence. Methods Participants represented both existing and newly interested stakeholders of the natural experimental study, from national and local government, the third sector, and academia. We conducted participant observation during an interactive event with 41 stakeholders and semi-structured interviews with 17 of them. Formal and informal interactions between stakeholders were recorded in field notes. Interviews considered the event format and content as well as knowledge exchange in general. Thematic content analysis of field notes and transcripts was undertaken. Findings Stakeholders working across sectors expressed uncertainties about finding a common language between research and practice and between sectors, and about who had the capacity to translate across these boundaries. They also expressed differing expectations of evidence. Whereas public health specialists tended to have a hierarchical view of evidence that favoured <b>trials,</b> <b>transport</b> specialists tended to prefer case studies as precedents for workable solutions. However, stakeholders encountered uncertainties about their preferred evidence. Population health studies generated more complex results than did those of apparently clear-cut randomised controlled trials; case studies highlighted the context-dependency of evidence and difficulties in transferring insights across settings. Finally, stakeholders had to reconcile uncertainties about “health in all remits”. Despite its premise, public health was not always acknowledged to contribute to the goals of other policy sectors, and stakeholders had to negotiate competing priorities, such as those between health improvement and economic growth, or between integrated and designated budgets. Interpretation This case study of stakeholders' experiences indicates that multisectoral research, practice, and policymaking require the ability and capacity to locate, understand, and communicate complex evidence from a variety of disciplines, and integrate different types of evidence into clear business cases...|$|R
40|$|Two {{preliminary}} {{experiments were}} conducted with artificially inseminated ewes to examine the considerable variation in counts of spermatozoa recovered in flushings from the reproductive tract. In the second <b>trial,</b> road <b>transport</b> stress immediately after insemination caused {{a reduction in the}} number of spermatozoa reaching the Fallopian tubes. In the third <b>trial,</b> sperm <b>transport</b> after insemination with fresh, undiluted semen at two sites in the tract at predetermined times relative to synchronised ovulation (progestagen-HCG treatment) was investigated. Deposition of semen at the uterine end of the cervix or within the uterus using a specially adapted inseminating pippette, resulted in the recovery of higher numbers of spermatozoa from the uterus and Fallopian tubes 4 hours after insemination, than did insemination at the external cervical os. Twenty-four hours after insemination similar numbers of spermatozoa were found in all segments for both sites of insemination. Deposition of semen before or after the expected time of ovulation, or at both times, had little effect on the numbers of spermatozoa recovered. More ova with accessory spermatozoa were recovered from oviducts containing high numbers of sperm. The transport of spermatozoa after deposition of fresh or frozen semen into the uterus by surgical and non-surgical methods, was studied in a fourth experiment. The number of spermatozoa recovered from the uterus and isthmus was similar for both types of semen, but only 'fresh' spermatozoa deposited at surgery, reached the ampulla in significant numbers. 'Frozen' sperm deposited by both methods, and fresh sperm deposited non-surgically, did not reach the ampulla within 4 hours of insemination. Impaired transport of 'frozen' spermatozoa to the site of fertilization appeared to be a result of reduced longevity of these cells within the female tract, and nay involve factors such as breakage of spermatozoa in the uterus, and delayed transport in the oviducts. The improvement of sperm transport in the ewe through the development of non-surgical, intrauterine inseminations and using either freshly extended or frozen semen, are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Children’s {{disruptive}} behavior problems place children {{at high risk}} for oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, and carry a high burden for individuals and society. Policy makers and service providers aiming to reduce children’s {{disruptive behavior}} problems must often choose between importing an intervention developed abroad or instead developing or using a “homegrown” (i. e., local) intervention. No comprehensive comparison of these interventions exists. Method: We performed a multilevel meta-regression of 129 randomized trials (374 effect sizes) of transported and homegrown parenting interventions. We identified trials by searching the included trials lists of systematic reviews, found through searches in 6 databases (e. g., MEDLINE, EMBASE). Trials that had not yet been reviewed were found by searching the same databases. Primary outcome was the mean difference in effectiveness between transported and homegrown interventions to reduce disruptive child behavior.

40|$|Ectotherms {{regulate}} {{body temperature}} (Tb) primarily through behavioral interactions with their environment. These animals also have limited aerobic scopes and {{must rely on}} anaerobic metabolism to support intense activity; lactate byproduct and glycogen depletion are two consequences of anaerobic metabolism that {{must be dealt with}} during exercise recovery. It has been suggested that, in many ectothermic species, Tb may affect the rate of lactate clearance and glycogen repletion during recovery from intense exercise. This study investigated thermoregulatory behavior in Western Fence Lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis) to determine preferred Tb during exercise recovery. I hypothesized that animals would select higher Tb’sduring the recovery period on the basis that biochemical processes occur at faster rates at high temperatures, which may facilitate a more rapid reduction of lactate and replenishment of glycogen stores. However, it was found that control animals maintained a constant Tb of 33 °C, while exercised animals cooled Tb to 30 °C 20 minutes after exercising, and eventually warmed to 32 °C by the 2 hour mark. Animals were found to be able to cool Tb by a maximum of 0. 175 °C/min given the available temperatures, which negated possible effects of temperature variation on Tb during exercise <b>trials</b> and <b>transport.</b> My results suggest a benefit of lowered Tb to facilitate exercise recovery in these animals.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the stress response of pirarucu juveniles in a closed system transport. Pirarucu (Arapaima gigas) is a native Amazonian fish species from the Osteoglossidae family and an obligated air breather. A short duration <b>transport</b> <b>trial</b> (6 h) was undertaken comparing closed polyethylene bags filled with atmospheric air (Air group) and bags filled with pure oxygen (Oxi group). Dissolved oxygen was the only water parameter that presented a difference between fish groups, and was saturated in the oxi group as expected. There was no mortality in either group after transport. Fish feeding was observed 36 h after transport for all fish, and normal feeding consumption was observed at 72 h. In both groups physiological responses were similar. Cortisol did not show any significant alteration during the sampled period. Unlike most fish species, cortisol values were unaltered in both groups during sampling, while glucose presented a significant change up to 12 h after transport.

30|$|Upon {{designing}} and performing the fish <b>transport</b> <b>trials</b> {{described in this}} paper, it became evident that very little information is currently available regarding the live transport of pelagic fish. In fact, the only resources in the scientific literature describe usage of medium to large fishing vessels, capable of transporting big water tanks on-board (Wexler et al. 2003; Margulies et al. 2007). The only alternative that was briefly discussed for small-scale live pelagic fish transport for research operations was using tuna tubes (McPherson 2004). However, {{the majority of the}} knowledge and experience regarding the use of tuna tubes for live fish transport is withheld in the hands of recreational and semi-commercial game fishermen and is not publicly available for the research community. Considering this gap in knowledge, lack of alternatives and the complexity of live transport of fast-swimming pelagic fish, our results show, despite the limited success in capturing a large number of fish, that even basic improvements to the original tuna tubes design can improve survival rates. This study offers the knowledge and information to encourage further optimization of the tuna tubes, which should include direct measurements of stress level and water quality parameters, to provide research facilities with a cost effective and applicable method for small-scale transportation of pelagic fish.|$|R

40|$|Rear-end crashes {{constitute}} approximately 30 % of all {{crashes and}} drivers who maintain inappropriately short time headways {{are at a}} higher risk {{for this type of}} crash. One approach to help drivers maintain appropriate headway times is to use technology to monitor headway and provide drivers with feedback. This paper investigates the effects of a feedback-reward system on headway time. Data utilized in this research were collected from 37 participants (20 to 70 years old) through a field <b>trial</b> commissioned by <b>Transport</b> Canada. In this field trial, a feedback-reward system was investigated, which provided feedback and rewards to the drivers based on safe headway maintenance (≥ 1. 2 seconds) and speed limit compliance. The trial consisted of three phases: baseline (two weeks), intervention (twelve weeks), and post-intervention (two weeks). During the intervention phase, real-time feedback was provided on an in-vehicle display. Participants also accumulated reward points and could view related information on a special website. Results indicate that the intervention increased safe headway compliance rates by 10 %. Further, during instances when the drivers were not within the safe headway time, headway time was larger in the intervention period compared to the baseline. Thus, intervention had a positive effect even when the drivers were not compliant. To a large degree, these benefits appeared to not persist in the post-intervention phase...|$|R
