5|$|Chinook HC.2 ZD576 {{crashed on}} the Mull of Kintyre, Scotland, killing all 25 {{passengers}} and all four crew members; <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> disputed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> not {{completely}} understood, but involves a T cell-mediated immune response {{triggered by a}} variety of factors. Different individuals have different triggers, which may include nutritional deficiencies, local trauma, stress, hormonal influences, allergies, genetic predisposition or other factors.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Hindenburg airship was a notorious example of hydrogen combustion and <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> still debated. The visible orange flames in that incident {{were the result of}} a rich mixture of hydrogen to oxygen combined with carbon compounds from the airship skin.|$|E
50|$|An {{investigation}} into possible sabotage commenced. A theory emerged that <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> a bomb dropped accidentally by a Swedish plane on training maneuvers, and other theories <b>were</b> advanced. But <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> never established.|$|R
50|$|Géo Lefèvre insisted <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> food poisoning.|$|R

5|$|Epilepsy {{can have}} both genetic and {{acquired}} causes, with interaction {{of these factors}} in many cases. Established acquired causes include serious brain trauma, stroke, tumours and problems in the brain {{as a result of}} a previous infection. In about 60% of cases <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> unknown. Epilepsies caused by genetic, congenital, or developmental conditions are more common among younger people, while brain tumors and strokes are more likely in older people.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{typically}} involves both {{diarrhea and}} vomiting, or less commonly, presents {{with only one}} or the other. Abdominal cramping may also be present. Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72hours after contracting the infectious agent. If due to a viral agent, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some viral causes may also be associated with fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. If the stool is bloody, <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> {{less likely to be}} viral and more likely to be bacterial. Some bacterial infections may be associated with severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{are subject}} to equine {{recurrent}} laryngeal neuropathy, a disease of the axons of the recurrent laryngeal nerves. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> not known, although a genetic predisposition is suspected. The length of the nerve is a factor since it {{is more common in}} larger horses, and the left side is affected almost exclusively. As the nerve cells die, there is a progressive paralysis of the larynx, causing the airway to collapse. The common presentation is a sound, ranging from a musical whistle to a harsh roar or heaving gasping noise (stertorous), accompanied by worsening performance. The condition is incurable, but surgery can keep the airway open. Experiments with nerve grafts have been tried.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> {{thought to}} be a birdstrike.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>causes</b> <b>are</b> {{divided into}} benign or malignant.|$|R
50|$|The postulator for <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> Dr. Andrea Ambrosi.|$|R
5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH {{are due to}} trauma. In 85 percent of cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a weakness in the wall {{of one of the}} arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged. They tend to be located in the circle of Willis and its branches. While most cases of SAH are due to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> unknown. The {{underlying}} mechanism {{involves an}} autoimmune disorder {{in which the}} body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves and damages their myelin insulation. Sometimes this immune dysfunction is triggered by an infection or, less commonly, surgery or vaccination. The diagnosis is usually made based on the signs and symptoms, through the exclusion of alternative causes, and supported by tests such as nerve conduction studies and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. There {{are a number of}} subtypes based on the areas of weakness, results of nerve conduction studies, and the presence of certain antibodies. It is classified as an acute polyneuropathy.|$|E
5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> not clear, the {{underlying}} mechanism {{is thought to}} be either destruction by the immune system or failure of the myelin-producing cells. Proposed causes for this include genetics and environmental factors such as being triggered by a viral infection. MS is usually diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms and the results of supporting medical tests.|$|E

5|$|In 1816 {{his wife}} Sarah died, {{although}} <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> unrecorded. Evans remarried {{two years later}} in April 1818 to Hetty Ward, who was many years his junior and {{the daughter of the}} New York innkeeper. In these last years Evans lived in New York with his new wife. In early 1819 Evans developed an inflammation of the lungs and after a month of illness, died on April 15, 1819. Just four days prior, on April 11, news had reached him in New York that the Mars Works in Philadelphia had burned down, though his sons-in-law were committed to re-establishing the business and did so further outside of the city. Evans was buried at Zion Episcopal Church in Manhattan, but when that church was sold his body was moved several times until finally resting in 1890 in an unmarked common grave at Trinity Cemetery, Broadway at 157th Street, New York City.|$|E
5|$|Syndromes {{in which}} causes are not clearly {{identified}} {{are difficult to}} match with categories of the current classification of epilepsy. Categorization for these cases was made somewhat arbitrarily. The idiopathic (unknown cause) category of the 2011 classification includes syndromes in which the general clinical features and/or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic cause. Some childhood epilepsy syndromes {{are included in the}} unknown cause category in which <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> presumed genetic, for instance benign rolandic epilepsy. Others are included in symptomatic despite a presumed genetic cause (in at least in some cases), for instance Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not the main feature (e.g. Angelman syndrome) were categorized symptomatic but it was argued to include these within the category idiopathic. Classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> {{not entirely}} clear, but {{is thought to}} be multifactorial. It has even been {{suggested}} that aphthous stomatitis is not a single entity but rather a group of conditions with different causes. Multiple research studies have attempted to identify a causative organism, but aphthous stomatitis appears to be non-contagious, non-infectious and not sexually transmissible. The mucosal destruction {{is thought to be}} the result of a T cell (T lymphocyte) mediated immune response which involves the generation of interleukins and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Mast cells and macrophages are also involved, secreting TNF-α along with the T cells. When early aphthous ulcers are biopsied, the histologic appearance shows a dense inflammatory infiltrate, 80% of which is made up of T cells. Persons with aphthous stomatitis also have circulating lymphocytes which react with peptides 91–105 of heat shock protein 65–60, and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of individuals with aphthous stomatitis is decreased.|$|E
