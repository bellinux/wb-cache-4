5|$|Vieuxpont {{was one of}} only a few {{supporters}} of the king in northern England, and he most likely began construction of Brougham Castle as soon as he acquired the land. At this stage, the castle would have been enclosed by an earthen bank surmounted by a timber palisade. The first three storeys of the stone keep date from this period. It was entered through the first floor via a forebuilding. To the east of this was a stone structure which was probably a hall. Building in stone was an expensive and time-consuming process. No records <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> much Brougham cost to construct, but there are records for other stone construction. For example, the late-12th-century stone keep at Peveril Castle in Derbyshire would have cost around £200, although something on a much larger scale, such as the vast Château Gaillard, cost an estimated £15,000 to £20,000 and took several years to complete.|$|E

500|$|Acquiring {{a larger}} sample of such objects would help in {{determining}} which scenario is most likely. [...] "I call Sedna a fossil record of the earliest Solar System", said Brown in 2006. [...] "Eventually, when other fossil records are found, Sedna will help <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> the Sun formed {{and the number of}} stars that were close to the Sun when it formed." [...] A 2007–2008 survey by Brown, Rabinowitz and Megan Schwamb attempted to locate another member of Sedna's hypothetical population. Although the survey was sensitive to movement out to 1,000AU and discovered the likely dwarf planet , it detected no new sednoid. Subsequent simulations incorporating the new data suggested about 40 Sedna-sized objects probably exist in this region, with the brightest being about Eris's magnitude (−1.0).|$|E

500|$|The coast offered Percy Shelley and Edward Williams {{the chance}} to enjoy their [...] "perfect plaything for the summer", a new sailing boat. The boat had been {{designed}} by Daniel Roberts and Edward Trelawny, an admirer of Byron's who had joined the party in January 1822. On 1 July 1822, Percy Shelley, Edward Ellerker Williams, and Captain Daniel Roberts sailed south down the coast to Livorno. There Percy Shelley discussed with Byron and Leigh Hunt the launch of a radical magazine called The Liberal. On 8 July, he and Edward Williams {{set out on the}} return journey to Lerici with their eighteen-year-old boatboy, Charles Vivian. They never reached their destination. A letter arrived at Villa Magni from Hunt to Percy Shelley, dated 8 July, saying, [...] "pray write to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> you got home, for they say you had bad weather after you sailed monday & we are anxious". [...] "The paper fell from me," [...] Mary told a friend later. [...] "I trembled all over." [...] She and Jane Williams rushed desperately to Livorno and then to Pisa in the fading hope that their husbands were still alive. Ten days after the storm, three bodies washed up on the coast near Viareggio, midway between Livorno and Lerici. Trelawny, Byron, and Hunt cremated Percy Shelley’s corpse on the beach at Viareggio.|$|E

2500|$|Taylor's theorem is of {{asymptotic}} nature: it only {{tells us}} that the error Rk in an approximation by a k-th order Taylor polynomial Pk tends to zero faster than any nonzero k-th degree polynomial as x→a. It does not <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> large the error is in any concrete neighborhood of the center of expansion, but for this purpose there are explicit formulae for the remainder term (given below) which are valid under some additional regularity assumptions on f. These enhanced versions of Taylor's theorem typically lead to uniform estimates for the approximation error in a small neighborhood of the center of expansion, but the estimates do not necessarily hold for neighborhoods which are too large, even if the function f is analytic. In that situation one may have to select several Taylor polynomials with different centers of expansion to have reliable Taylor-approximations of the original function (see animation on the right.) ...|$|E
