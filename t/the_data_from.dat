5|$|The {{investigators}} also {{requested that}} Fokker conduct {{a study of}} the effects of ice contamination and pilot technique on the F28 aircraft. The NTSB evaluated <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> the tests and found that the pilot initiated the rotation five knots earlier at 119 knots instead of the proper rotation speed of 124 knots. <b>The</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> Fokker was correlated with the cockpit voice recording and confirmed that the first officer called a rotation speed of 113 knots but the captain did not rotate until 119 knots. It was never established why the rotation was called and initiated earlier than was standard.|$|E
5|$|Mariner 9 and Viking allowed better maps of Mars to be {{made using}} <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> these missions, and another major leap forward was the Mars Global Surveyor mission, {{launched}} in 1996 and operated until late 2006, that allowed complete, extremely detailed maps of the Martian topography, magnetic field and surface minerals to be obtained. These maps are available online; for example, at Google Mars. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Express continued exploring with new instruments, and supporting lander missions. NASA provides two online tools: Mars Trek, which provides visualizations of the planet using data from 50 years of exploration, and Experience Curiosity, which simulates traveling on Mars in 3-D with Curiosity.|$|E

Scully presents Skinner with the newspaper article, thinking that <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> Soona's death can clear Mulder in his father's murder. Skinner, however, refuses to do any follow-up on it. After Scully leaves it is revealed that the Cigarette Smoking Man was waiting in an adjacent room to question Skinner about the exchange. Leaving the building, Scully has a hunch upon seeing the metal detector again that leads to locating metal {{in the back of}} her neck. Scully sees a doctor, who removes a small metal implant.|$|E
5|$|Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory {{think that}} Voyager 1 entered the {{termination}} shock in February 2003. This marks {{the point where}} the solar wind slows down to subsonic speeds. Some other scientists expressed doubt, discussed in the journal Nature of November 6, 2003. The issue would not be resolved until other data became available, since Voyager 1s solar-wind detector ceased functioning in 1990. This failure meant that termination shock detection would have to be inferred from <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> the other instruments on board.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, {{provided}} a comprehensive coverage of Jupiter's magnetic field near the equatorial plane at distances up to 100RJ. The regions studied included the magnetotail and the dawn and dusk {{sectors of the}} magnetosphere. While Galileo successfully survived in the harsh radiation environment of Jupiter, it still experienced a few technical problems. In particular, the spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors. Several times electrical arcs occurred between rotating and non-rotating parts of the spacecraft, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> the 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileo's ultra-stable quartz oscillator.|$|E

5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{remastering}} {{work was}} outsourced to the Shanghai-based studio Virtuos. Square Enix's internal staff was responsible for reassembling the original assets, and helped with a part of redoing the high-definition data. Among the returning original team members were Motomu Toriyama, Yusuke Naora, Toshitaka Matsuda and Masaki Kobayashi who supervised the production. X-2 art director Shintaro Takai remained in the same role for both remastered games. The Chinese side of development was headed by managing director Pan Feng. The team encountered problems in porting the games to PlayStation 3 and Vita as their graphics used many functionalities unique to the PlayStation 2 hardware. The loss and repair {{of some of the}} original assets posed another hurdle, with Kitase commenting that it might have been easier to recreate <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> the ground up.|$|E

We now have the data, therefore, the challenge remains with all of us to ensure it is put into good use by making informed decisions for our people,”. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) helped the Government of Zambia, especially the Child Welfare Ministry to update <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> the Living Condition Monitoring Survey (LCMS) and data on all key performance indicators of the National Development Plan (ZNDP) during 2013.|$|E

The development of the Lockheed U-2 and the SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft, as well as the XB-70, prompted Soviet aerospace engineers to design and develop their high-altitude and high-speed MiG-25 interceptor.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the command {{sequence}} to be relayed to the spacecraft and the calculations for each photograph's exposure time were developed by space scientists Candy Hansen of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Carolyn Porco of the University of Arizona. After the planned imaging sequence was taken on February 14, 1990, <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> the camera was stored initially in an on-board tape recorder. Transmission to Earth was also delayed by the Magellan and Galileo missions being given priority {{over the use of}} the Deep Space Network. Then, between March and May 1990, Voyager 1 returned 60 frames back to Earth, with the radio signal travelling {{at the speed of light}} for nearly five and a half hours to cover the distance.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{performance}} of an SSD {{is dependent upon}} a number of factors, including write amplification. Writing to a flash memory device takes longer than reading from it. An SSD generally uses multiple flash memory components connected in parallel to increase performance. If the SSD has a high write amplification, the controller {{will be required to}} write that many more times to the flash memory. This requires even more time to write <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> the host. An SSD with a low write amplification will not need to write as much data and can therefore be finished writing sooner than a drive with a high write amplification.|$|E

5|$|The sum {{argument}} {{advanced by}} the JWP in {{the approval of}} the discovery of nihonium was later criticized in a May 2016 study from Lund University and the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, as it is only valid if no gamma decay or internal conversion takes place along the decay chain, which is not likely for odd nuclei, and the uncertainty of the alpha decay energies measured in the 278Nh decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility; and if this is the case, similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters become a meaningless argument, as different isomers of the same nuclide can have wildly different half-lives (the ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of mere hours, but an excited state 180mTa has never been observed to decay). However, although this study found reason to doubt and criticize the IUPAC approval of the discoveries of moscovium and tennessine, <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> RIKEN for nihonium was found to be congruent, and <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> the Dubna team for moscovium and nihonium to probably be so, thus necessitating no criticism of the IUPAC approval of the discovery of element 113.|$|E
5|$|To {{accurately}} {{plan the}} brachytherapy procedure, a thorough clinical examination is performed {{to understand the}} characteristics of the tumour. In addition, a range of imaging modalities can be used to visualise the shape and size of the tumour and its relation to surrounding tissues and organs. These include x-ray radiography, ultrasound, computed axial tomography (CT or CAT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). <b>The</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> many of these sources can be used to create a 3D visualisation of the tumour and the surrounding tissues.|$|E
5|$|Transit {{observations}} in 1874 and 1882 allowed this value to be refined further. Three expeditions—from Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States—were {{sent to the}} Kerguelen Archipelago for the 1874 observations. The American astronomer Simon Newcomb combined <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> the last four transits, and he arrived at a value of about 149.59 million kilometers (±0.31 million kilometers). Modern techniques, {{such as the use}} of radio telemetry from space probes, and of radar measurements of the distances to planets and asteroids in the Solar System, have allowed a reasonably accurate value for the astronomical unit (AU) to be calculated to a precision of about ±30 meters. As a result, the need for parallax calculations has been superseded.|$|E
