5|$|Originally, {{the story}} of a woman {{separated}} from her husband when the plane crashes was going to be used for Kate, but when Kate's role in the series changed the producers kept that story for Rose.

Critics reacted positively to the couple, often hoping they would appear more frequently, and both actors were praised for their work.|$|E
