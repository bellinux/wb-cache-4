5|$|Conditions in {{the casual}} wards were worse {{than in the}} {{relieving}} rooms and deliberately designed to discourage vagrants, who were considered potential trouble-makers and probably disease-ridden. Vagrants who presented themselves at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> workhouse were {{at the mercy of}} the porter, whose decision it was whether or not to allocate them a bed for the night in the casual ward. Those refused entry risked being sentenced to two weeks of hard labour if they were found begging or sleeping in the open and prosecuted for an offence under the Vagrancy Act 1824.|$|E

Laura finally realizes what happened: while searching for Simón the night he disappeared, Laura moved pieces of construction scaffolding, blocking {{the entrance to the}} secret room. The crashes that night were caused by Simón trying to get out. He fell and broke his neck.|$|E

5|$|The Playford family {{heritage}} can {{be traced}} back to 1759, when a baby boy was left at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> house in Barnby Dun, Yorkshire, England, with a note to christen the child 'Thomas Playford'. The occupants of the house, who were to raise the child, were given instructions to receive money from a bank account for the deed. The child grew up to be a simple farmer in the village, and had a son in 1795 who he christened 'Thomas Playford'. The tradition of naming the firstborn son in the family in this way has continued since.|$|E
5|$|The next night, the ghouls {{leave the}} belfry and float into town {{accompanied}} by their straitjacketed, deformed minions. They knock on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> student. When he opens it, aroused from sleeping, they hold {{him down and}} carve out his heart while he tries in vain to scream. At Giles' apartment his visiting girlfriend, Olivia, is frightened by one of The Gentlemen outside Giles' window. The following morning in a campus classroom, Giles uses a series of overhead transparencies {{to explain to the}} others that The Gentlemen steal the townspeople's voices so no one can scream as they gather the hearts they need, and that folklore indicates that they have been vanquished before when a princess screamed: the only thing that will kill them is a live human voice.|$|E

25|$|According to some reports, Gelman started {{banging on}} <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> motorman's cab, {{demanding}} {{to be let}} in, at which point two police officers assigned to the manhunt arrived and subdued him after a struggle with Lozito's help.

25|$|The traps of the bladderworts {{may have}} derived from {{pitchers}} that specialized in aquatic prey when flooded, like Sarracenia psittacina does today. Escaping prey in terrestrial pitchers {{have to climb}} or fly out of a trap, and both of these can be prevented by wax, gravity and narrow tubes. However, a flooded trap can be swum out of, so in Utricularia, a one-way lid may have developed to form <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> proto-bladder. Later, this may have become active by {{the evolution of a}} partial vacuum inside the bladder, tripped by prey brushing against trigger hairs {{on the door of the}} bladder.|$|E

They knocked on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> private house and called out in Arabic via the intercom, frightening the residents into calling the police. Then, they killed responding police officer Eliyahu Shahar. According to the Israeli security services' reconstruction of the incident, Shahar was killed after he got out of his vehicle and fired two warning shots into the air. Kuntar's group responded with a massive burst of gunfire. Samir Kuntar boasted that he alone shot 30 bullets in this incident.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} in Halbe was desperate for the Germans. Orders {{were still being}} issued to recognisable formations, but these were by now all mixed up. There was considerable tension between the Waffen-SS and Wehrmacht troops, with both accusing the other of helping their own while ignoring {{the plight of the}} other. In Halbe itself, some of the civilians took pity on very young soldiers ("Kindersoldaten") and allowed them to change out of their uniforms into civilian clothes. In one documented case, an SS man appeared at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cellar intending to shoot a Panzerfaust into a cellar with about 40 civilians and young Wehrmacht soldiers in it, only to be shot dead by one of the soldiers.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} noted that the tachi would be paired with a tantō and later the uchigatana would be paired with another shorter uchigatana. With {{the advent of the}} katana, the wakizashi {{eventually}} was chosen by samurai as the short sword over the tantō. Kanzan Satō in his book The Japanese sword notes that there {{did not seem to be}} any particular need for the wakizashi and suggests that the wakizashi may have become more popular than the tantō due to the wakizashi being more suited for indoor fighting. He mentions the custom of leaving the katana at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> castle or palace when entering while continuing to wear the wakizashi inside.|$|E

25|$|The College was {{in great}} {{disrepair}} when Jan Standonck took over—some {{of the walls}} were falling down. It had {{become known as the}} Collège de Montaigu, after the Archbishop's brother, and Jan was to make it famous. He imposed a very severe regime on the students. They could leave only with his permission and had to return before nightfall—he took the key from the porter every night. They wore only a single cloth gown and were given only a piece of bread each day to eat. They had to go to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nearby monastery at eleven o'clock each morning to receive a hand-out of food. They were punished for the slightest fault, and were encouraged—out of pure charity—to inform of any misdemeanours, and to criticise each other's conduct. Erasmus, one of the students, later said he did not think anyone could forget—or even survive unscathed—their time at the College.|$|E
25|$|Schiele {{was born}} in 1890 in Tulln, Lower Austria. His father, Adolf Schiele, the station master of the Tulln station in the Austrian State Railways, {{was born in}} 1851 in Vienna to Karl Ludwig Schiele, a German from Ballenstedt and Aloisia Schimak; Egon Schiele's mother Marie, née Soukup, was born in 1861 in Český Krumlov (Krumau) to Johann Franz Soukup, a Czech father from Mirkovice, and Aloisia Poferl, a German Bohemian mother from Český Krumlov. As a child, Schiele was fascinated by trains, and would spend many hours drawing them, {{to the point where}} his father felt obliged to destroy his sketchbooks. When he was 11years old, Schiele moved to the nearby city of Krems (and later to Klosterneuburg) to attend {{secondary}} school. To those around him, Schiele was regarded as a strange child. Shy and reserved, he did poorly at school except in athletics and drawing, and was usually in classes made up of younger pupils. He also displayed incestuous tendencies towards his younger sister Gertrude (who was known as Gerti), and his father, well aware of Egon's behaviour, was once forced to break down <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> locked room that Egon and Gerti were in to see what they were doing (only to discover that they were developing a film). When he was sixteen he took the twelve-year-old Gerti by train to Trieste without permission and spent a night in a hotel room with her.|$|E
25|$|Paine {{was arrested}} in France on December 28, 1793. Joel Barlow was {{unsuccessful}} in securing Paine’s release by circulating a petition among American residents in Paris. Sixteen American citizens were allowed to plead for Paine’s release to the Convention, yet President Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier of the Committee of General Security refused to acknowledge Paine’s American citizenship, stating he was an Englishman and a citizen of a country at war with France. Paine himself protested and claimed {{that he was a}} citizen of the U.S., which was an ally of Revolutionary France, rather than of Great Britain, which was by that time at war with France. However, Gouverneur Morris, the American minister to France, did not press his claim, and Paine later wrote that Morris had connived at his imprisonment. Paine narrowly escaped execution. A chalk mark was supposed to be left by the gaoler on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cell to denote that the prisoner inside was due to be removed for execution. In Paine's case, the mark had accidentally been made on the inside of his door rather than the outside; this was {{due to the fact that}} the door of Paine's cell had been left open whilst the gaoler was making his rounds that day, since Paine had been receiving official visitors. But for this quirk of fate, Paine would have been executed the following morning. He kept his head and survived the few vital days needed to be spared by the fall of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor (July 27, 1794).|$|E
