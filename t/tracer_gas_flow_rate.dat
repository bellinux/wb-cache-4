40|$|In {{a typical}} {{air-conditioned}} office, the thermal comfort and {{indoor air quality}} are sustained by delivering the amount of supply air with the correct proportion of outdoor air to the breathing zone. However, in a real office, {{it is not easy}} to measure these airflow rates supplied to space, especially when the space is served by a variable air volume (VAV) system. The most accurate method depends on what is being measured, the details of the building and types of ventilation system. The constant concentration <b>tracer</b> <b>gas</b> method as a means to determine ventilation system performance, however, this method becomes more complicated when the air, including the <b>tracer</b> <b>gas</b> is allowed to recirculate. An accurate measurement requires significant resource support in terms of instrumentation set up and also professional interpretation. This method deters regular monitoring of the performance of an airside systems by building managers, and hence the indoor environmental quality, in terms of thermal comfort and indoor air quality, may never be satisfactory. This paper proposes a space zone model for the calculation of all the airflow parameters based on <b>tracer</b> <b>gas</b> measurements, including <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> of outdoor air, VAV supply, return space, return and exfiltration. Sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) are used as <b>tracer</b> <b>gases.</b> After using both SF 6 and CO 2, the corresponding results provide a reference to justify the acceptability of using CO 2 as the <b>tracer</b> <b>gas.</b> The validity of using CO 2 has the significance that metabolic carbon dioxide can be used as a means to evaluate real time airflow rates. This approach provides a practical protocol for building managers to evaluate the performance of airside systems. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

All results {{are based on}} physical modeling studies carried out both using low and high <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> and nozzle diameters ranging from 0. 8 mm to 3. 0 mm. At the low <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> the penetration depth in the bath was studied. The experiments focused on studying the effect of nozzle diameter, lance height and <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> on the penetration depth. It {{was found that the}} penetration depth increases with decreasing nozzle diameter, decreasing lance height and with increasing <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> The results were also compared with previous work. More specifically, it was studied how the previous published empirical relationships fitted the current experimental data. It was found that the relationships of Banks [1], Davenport [2], Chatterjee [3] and Qian [4] agreed well with the experimental data of this investigation for nozzle diameters of 2. 0 mm and 3. 0 mm. However, for smaller nozzle diameters there were considerable deviations. Therefore, a new correlation heuristically derived from energy conservation consideration was suggested and showed better agreement for small nozzle diameters. The experiments carried out at higher <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> focused on the study of swirl motion. The effects of nozzle diameter, lance height, <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and aspect ratio on the swirl motion were investigated. The amplitude and period of the swirl as well as the starting time and the damping time of the swirl were determined. The amplitude was found to increase with an increased nozzle diameter and <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> while the period had a constant value of about 0. 5 s for all nozzle diameters, <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> and lance heights.

40|$|In this work, we {{extend our}} {{previous}} {{efforts on the}} effect of surfactants on air-water flow in a vertical pipe by also considering pipe inclinations between 20 ° (with respect to horizontal) and vertical. For air-water flow, independent of the inclination, there is a regular annular <b>flow</b> at large <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> and an irregular churn or slug <b>flow</b> at low <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> Closely related to the transition between regular and irregular flow, although not necessarily coinciding with it, there is a minimum in the pressure gradient {{as a function of the}} <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> In <b>gas</b> wells, surfactants are used to shift this minimum to lower <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> which allows a stable gas production up to lower reservoir pressures. In this work, we investigate how the pipe inclination affects air-water flow without and with surfactants. Surfactants generate foam, which decreases the density and increases the thickness of the film at the pipe wall. For vertical flow, we previously established that surfactants increase the pressure gradient at high <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> decrease the pressure gradient at low <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> shift the minimum in the pressure gradient to lower <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> and shift the transition between regular and irregular <b>flow</b> to lower <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> The new results described in this paper show that for large <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> both the <b>flow</b> with and without surfactants is unaffected by the inclination. At low gas velocities, however, in inclined pipes the surfactants are much less effective at shifting the transition between irregular flow and regular flow and at shifting the minimum in the pressure gradient than in vertical pipes. The foam causes a regular film morphology at the top wall of the pipe, but is unable to make the morphology of the bottom liquid film regular. As a result, at low <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> the relative decrease of the pressure gradient due to surfactants is smaller for smaller inclinations from horizontal. This larger relative decrease for vertical flow compared to inclined flow is related to an increased foam formation and therefore a smaller mass density of the film in vertical flow. </p...|$|R

The experimental results indicate that in the cases of four tuyeres in the square-corner and triangle-corner-center placements, 10. 0 mm tuyeres yield the shortest mixing time (and thus the best mixing effect) under different total <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> In the case of five tuyeres in the square-corner-center placement, 10. 0 mm tuyeres also have the shortest mixing time under total <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> of 400 NL/min and 500 NL/min. However, 12. 5 mm tuyeres have the shortest mixing time under a total <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> of 600 NL/min. In addition, in the case of three tuyeres in the triangle-corner placement, 12. 5 mm tuyeres have the shortest mixing time under different total <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> When the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> per tuyere is 80 NL/min, the fewer the tuyeres, the shorter the mixing time. Depending on tuyere placement, some of the energy injected by the gas may be counteracted. For example, when a bottom-blowing tuyere exists in the center, the gas injection from that tuyere may be counteracted by that of adjacent tuyeres such that energy dissipates. In contrast, a tuyer...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} various N 2 <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> on {{friction}} coefficient and surface roughness of TiN-coated D 2 tool steel was examined by a commercially available cathodic arc physical vapor deposition (CAPVD) technique. A Pin-on-Disc test was carried out to study the Coefficient of friction (COF) versus sliding distance. A surface roughness tester measured the surface roughness parameters. The minimum values for the COF and surface roughness were recorded at a N 2 <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> of 200 sccm. The increase in the COF and surface roughness at a N 2 <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> of 100 sccm was mainly attributed {{to an increase in}} both size and number of titanium particles, whereas the increase at 300 sccm was attributed to a larger number of growth defects generated during the coating process. These ideas make it possible to optimize the coating properties as a function of N 2 <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> for specific applications, e. g. cutting tools for automobiles, aircraft, and various mechanical parts. Coatings, TiN, cathodic arc, friction coefficient, surface roughness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A stable 12 -phase AC arc was {{successfully}} developed and {{applied in the}} field of glass in-flight melting, and the arc discharge behavior was characterized by image analysis. The effects of sheath <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> on arc discharge and melting behavior of granulated glass raw material were investigated. Results show that different sheath <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> lead to various arc discharge and high-temperature region. The fluctuation of luminance area ratio and coefficient of variation reflects the change of arc discharge behavior. As the sheath <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> increases, the ratio of luminance area decreases and the center temperature of arc increases. The vitrification degree of glass raw material is mostly dependent on the center temperature of arc, higher center temperature and more vitrification degree...|$|R
