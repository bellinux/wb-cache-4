5|$|All these controversies {{have led}} {{ethnic groups in}} Macedonia to use terms in {{conflicting}} ways. Despite the fact that <b>these</b> <b>terms</b> {{may not always be}} used in a pejorative way, they may be perceived as such by the ethnic group to which they are applied. Both Greeks and ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from Macedonia to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side, or the region in general.|$|E
5|$|Buckner had a keen {{interest}} in politics and friends had been urging him to run for governor since 1867, even while terms of his surrender confined him to Louisiana. Unwilling to violate <b>these</b> <b>terms,</b> he instructed a friend to withdraw his name from consideration if it was presented. In 1868, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention that nominated Horatio Seymour for president. Though Buckner had favored George H. Pendleton, he loyally supported the party's nominee throughout the campaign.|$|E

It does not mean to surrender, although it may sometimes be used in preparation to surrendering. Truce terms are only used within a specific age group, have little currency outside that group and are by and large abandoned by the age of 10 or 11 years.

5|$|Given {{the large}} number of Latter Day Saint churches and their differing backgrounds, categorizing them can be difficult.

5|$|However, Nosanchuk {{was still}} not certain that he would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds. In Ontario at that time, a {{defendant}} found not guilty under <b>these</b> <b>terms</b> remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province's Executive Council, acting {{on the advice of}} a Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge. Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk that even if he used an insanity defence and won, Lamb would probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane for life. It was still possible for the lawyer to approach the prosecution and propose a plea bargain, offering to plead guilty to non-capital murder, which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years. In any case, Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written instruction from his client to plead insanity. Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter, Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a mental disorder defence. The boy made clear his understanding that if he were found not guilty under <b>these</b> <b>terms,</b> the state still had the right to detain him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

Wulfred is recorded to have agreed to <b>these</b> <b>terms,</b> but the conflict continued well past Coenwulf's death, with an apparently final agreement between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter Cwoenthryth reached in 826 or 827. However, Wulfred officiated at the consecration of Coenwulf's brother and heir, Ceolwulf, on 17 September 822, so {{it is evident that}} some accommodation had been reached by that time.

5|$|In {{a general}} peace conference at Sparta, the Spartans, with their {{authority}} {{enhanced by the}} threat of Persian intervention, secured the acquiescence of all the major states of Greece to <b>these</b> <b>terms.</b> The agreement eventually produced was commonly known as the King's Peace, reflecting the Persian influence the treaty showed. This treaty marked the first attempt at a Common Peace in Greek history; under the treaty, all cities were to be independent, a clause that would be enforced by the Spartans as guardians of the peace. Under threat of Spartan intervention, Thebes disbanded its league, and Argos and Corinth ended their experiment in shared government; Corinth, deprived of its strong ally, was incorporated back into Sparta's Peloponnesian League. After 8 years of fighting, the Corinthian war was at an end.|$|E
