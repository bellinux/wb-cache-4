5|$|Blood {{was viewed}} as a potent source of {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E
5|$|In the Epistle to the Hebrews, Abraham's {{willingness}} to follow God's command to sacrifice Isaac {{is used as}} an example of faith as is Isaac's action in blessing Jacob and Esau with reference to the future promised by God to Abraham In verse 19, the author views the release of Isaac from sacrifice as analogous to the resurrection of Jesus, the idea of <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> Isaac being a prefigure of <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> Jesus on the cross.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} first {{sequence}} of pictures, the three panels concerning Noah, taken from the sixth to ninth chapters of Genesis are thematic rather than chronological. In the first scene is shown <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> a sheep. Vasari, in writing about this scene mistakes it for the sacrifices by Cain and Abel, in which Abel's sacrifice was acceptable to God and Cain's was not. What this image almost certainly depicts is the sacrifice made by the family of Noah, after their safe deliverance from the Great Flood which destroyed the rest of Humankind.|$|E
5|$|Congressional {{reaction}} to the losses suffered by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer's unit at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 was shock and dismay at {{the failure of the}} Peace Policy. Grant blamed Custer wholly for the defeat stating that <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> troops was unnecessary. The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant's Peace Policy. The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies.|$|E

5|$|The flag {{does not}} differ {{significantly}} from {{the flag of the}} Byelorussian SSR, other than the removal of the hammer and sickle and the red star, and the reversal of red and white in the hoist pattern. While there is no official interpretation for the colors of the flag, an explanation given by President Alexander Lukashenko is that red represents freedom and <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> the nation's forefathers, while green represents life.|$|E
5|$|Almost 35,000 South Australians {{served in}} the First World War. This number {{amounted}} to 8.5% of the South Australian population at the time, or 37.7% of men {{between the ages of}} 18 and 44. Of those who served, over 5,000 South Australians died. In response to these deaths, Archibald Peake, the premier of South Australia, asked the state parliament to fund a memorial commemorating the victory and <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> those who had fought and fallen. The motion was presented in March 1919, and it received unanimous support in the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council. With the passing of this motion, the South Australian Government became the first in Australia to elect to build a memorial to the soldiers of the First World War.|$|E
5|$|National {{governmental}} {{bodies and}} charities were rapidly formed to produce memorials for these sites. The British government, for example, {{set up the}} Battle Exploits Committee in 1919 to create national battlefield memorials, alongside {{the work of the}} IWGC. Initially their intent was to celebrate the more heroic aspects of the fighting, and to avoid the flavour of memorials to the fallen that were being built elsewhere; by 1921, however, the committee had entered into a partnership with IWGC and adopted the same focus on <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> the fallen soldiers. The Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission (CBMC) was similarly established in 1920 to produce war memorials for the major battlefields involving Canadian forces.|$|E

5|$|Rice is the {{foundation}} of every meal, and is often eaten with fish broth, greens, beans or squash. Manioc and green bananas are staples most commonly eaten when other more preferable foods are too expensive or out of season. The Antankarana were historically herders and although they are now generally agriculturalists, cattle are kept for milk. They are also viewed as a form of wealth; the number of cattle one gives away indicates generosity, and the number sacrificed to the ancestors is a measure of loyalty. <b>The</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> zebu is a typical element of many major rituals and celebrations ranging from Muslim holidays to life events like marriage, death and birth.|$|E
5|$|The Eucharist {{was a key}} {{center of}} {{controversy}} in the Reformation as it not only focused differences between the reformers and the church but also between themselves. For Zwingli {{it was a matter}} of attacking a doctrine that imperiled the understanding and reception of God's gift of salvation, while for Luther {{it was a matter of}} defending a doctrine that embodied that gift. It is not known what Zwingli's eucharistic theology was before he became a reformer and there is disagreement among scholars about his views during his first few years as a priest. In the eighteenth article of The Sixty-seven Articles (1523) which concerns <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> the mass, he states that it is a memorial of the sacrifice. He expounds on this in An Exposition of the Articles (1523).|$|E
5|$|The Eucharistic celebration, {{also called}} the Mass or Divine liturgy, {{includes}} prayers and scriptural readings, {{as well as an}} offering of bread and wine, which are brought to the altar and consecrated by the priest to become the body and the blood of Jesus Christ, a change called transubstantiation. The words of consecration reflect the words spoken by Jesus during the Last Supper, where Christ offered his body and blood to his Apostles the night before his crucifixion. The sacrament re-presents (makes present) <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>of</b> Jesus on the cross, and perpetuates it. Christ's death and resurrection gives grace through the sacrament that unites the faithful with Christ and one another, remits venial sin, and aids against committing moral sin (though mortal sin itself is forgiven through the sacrament of penance).|$|E
50|$|The Canon {{continues}} {{with a prayer}} that God may accept <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>the</b> Church now offers as he accepted <b>the</b> <b>sacrifices</b> <b>of</b> three outstanding Old Testament figures. In other words, it asks that the devotion of the Church may be like theirs.|$|R
