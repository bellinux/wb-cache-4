5|$|Memento was re-released in the UK on a 3-disc Special Edition DVD on December 27, 2004. This release {{contains}} all the special {{features that are}} on the two US releases in one package plus a couple of new interviews. <b>The</b> <b>menus</b> appear as tattoos on a body and are more straightforward than the US 2-disc limited edition DVD.|$|E
5|$|The DVD boxset for season four was {{released}} by 20th Century Fox in the United States and Canada on June 15, 2004, eleven years after it had completed broadcast on television. As well as every episode from the season, the DVD release features bonus material including deleted scenes, Animatics, and commentaries for every episode. <b>The</b> <b>menus</b> are a different format than the previous seasons.|$|E
5|$|The PC version {{also has}} both DirectX 9 and DirectX 10 mode. It is labeled Games for Windows and runs on XP, Vista and 7. It assumes a Gamepad is present and only uses the mouse in <b>the</b> <b>menus,</b> {{providing}} the same interface as the Xbox 360 version.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>menu</b> bar in Microsoft Windows {{is usually}} {{anchored}} {{to the top of}} a window under the title bar; therefore, there can be many menu bars on screen at one time. Menus in <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> bar can be accessed through shortcuts involving the Alt key and the mnemonic letter that appears underlined in <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> title. Additionally, pressing Alt or F10 brings the focus on <b>the</b> first <b>menu</b> of <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> bar.|$|R

Note: everything on <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> can be done manually from the command processor.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Edit <b>menu</b> is a menu-type {{graphical}} {{control element}} {{found in most}} computer programs that handle files, text or images. It is often <b>the</b> second <b>menu</b> in <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> bar, next to <b>the</b> file <b>menu.</b>|$|R
5|$|Before {{each game}} and single-player Conquest, players choose between Sports and Action camera views. Action view is a {{trailing}} third-person shot similar to {{looking over the}} player-character's shoulder, while Sports view is a spectator perspective similar that of a televised basketball game. Enclosed arenas are inaccessible when using Sports view. The camera view cannot be changed once single-player begins, so Conquest mode players in Sports view will not see the arenas they unlock. The Action view camera swings wildly and can be pulled back slightly in <b>the</b> <b>menus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Favreau {{contacted}} Roy Choi, a restaurateur {{who created}} the Kogi Korean BBQ food truck, {{to serve as a}} consultant on the film; Choi was eventually promoted to co-producer. While the film was in pre-production, Favreau shadowed Choi in his restaurants and worked as part of Choi's kitchen crew after training at a culinary school. Choi oversaw all of <b>the</b> <b>menus</b> prepared for the film and created the Cuban sandwiches that formed a central part of the storyline.|$|E
5|$|The DVD boxset for season five was {{released}} by 20th Century Fox in the United States and Canada on December 21, 2004, ten years after it had completed broadcast on television. As well as every episode from the season, the DVD release features bonus material including deleted scenes, animatics, and commentaries for every episode. <b>The</b> <b>menus</b> are a different format than the previous seasons, and that format would be used in every set after.|$|E
50|$|Digeo, Inc. {{was awarded}} an Advanced Media Technology Emmy for its {{innovative}} Moxi Media Center User Interface, called <b>the</b> Moxi <b>Menu.</b> <b>The</b> Moxi <b>Menu’s</b> dual-axis navigation puts content choices on <b>the</b> <b>menu’s</b> top level, minimizing {{the number of}} clicks a user needs to go through.

40|$|We report {{results on}} the {{performance}} of the combination of soft keyboards and marking menus. A model of expert user performance indicated an 11 - 37 % (depending on the keyboard layout) improvement in text entry rate over the same keyboard without <b>the</b> <b>menu.</b> To verify <b>the</b> advantage in real usage, we conducted two experiments using the QWERTY keyboard layout with and without <b>the</b> <b>menu.</b> <b>The</b> first experiment imitated nearly perfect cognitive performance and measured motor performance. Using <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> saved time. <b>The</b> second experiment measured performance in a realistic text entry task. Initially using <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> slows down text entry. By the end of the 20 -session experiment both conditions were equally fast. With continued practice text entry is likely to be faster with <b>the</b> <b>menu...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Apple <b>menu</b> {{has been}} a feature in Apple's Mac OS since its inception.

5|$|The {{interior}} of the restaurant was designed by Adam Tihany, and features full length windows allowing diners to see straight into the kitchen. It features a pulley system based on a 16th-century design used for the British Royal Court. The brand identity items such as the logo and <b>the</b> <b>menus</b> were designed by design agency Seymourpowell.

5|$|The menu at Pétrus {{is split}} into several fixed price menus, {{containing}} modern French cuisine. It {{has been described}} by Zoe Williams as being distinctly Gordon Ramsay in composition, despite the influences of head chef Sean Burbidge. The meals come with an amuse-bouche, a pre-starter course, and after dinner chocolates in addition to the items listed on <b>the</b> <b>menus</b> themselves. A number of pan fried fish dishes have been on the menu, including mackerel with tomato chutney and a niçoise salad, and a sea bream course served with brown shrimp, samphire and an oyster velouté sauce. Further seafood related dishes include a langoustine and watercress soup entrée which was praised by food critic Jay Rayner. Sauces are generally delivered to the table in small jugs and are poured tableside.|$|E
5|$|As in Final Fantasy XII, {{enemies are}} {{integrated}} into the open field and can be approached or avoided by the player. When the player's character touches an enemy, the screen transitions from the regular map to a separate battle screen {{similar to those used}} in previous Final Fantasy titles. A maximum of three characters may be used in battles, which use a variant on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Under this system, the player selects an action from <b>the</b> <b>menus,</b> such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Unlike previous games in the series, the player only controls the lead character while the remaining two characters are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which continually refills to a set maximum number of slots. The ATB bar gradually increases in size throughout the game from two slots to six. The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions, or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of battle, and the characters' health is fully restored after each battle.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{is almost}} {{identical}} to the previous game's version of the series' Active Time Battle (ATB) system, called the Command Synergy Battle system. Under this system, the player selects an action from <b>the</b> <b>menus,</b> such as Attack, Abilities, or Item. Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which continually refills at a constant rate to a set maximum number of slots. The kinds of attack actions available are close-range melee attacks or ranged magical attacks, {{but there are also}} other magical actions that evoke healing or shielding abilities. The ATB bar can be increased in size throughout the game from three slots to six. The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of combat, and the characters' health is fully restored after each fight. Players have the option of restarting a battle while {{in the middle of a}} fight. During some skirmishes, players are put through quick time events called Cinematic Actions that allows them to deal higher damage to foes and end certain battles.|$|E

50|$|The two {{criteria}} for determining which menu items should be featured on a menu have been food cost percentage and gross profit. Food cost percentage is calculated {{by dividing the}} cost of <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> item ingredients, including surrounding dish items, e.g., salad, bread and butter, condiments, etc. by <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> price. Gross profit is calculated by subtracting <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> cost as previously defined, from <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> price. Advocates of Menu Engineering believe that gross profit trumps food cost so they tend to identify <b>menu</b> items with <b>the</b> highest gross profit, items like steaks and seafood, as the items to promote.|$|R

40|$|Rapid Order @ is an Ameritech Services {{audiotext}} {{system which}} lets consumers learn about and order 12 telephone services. <b>The</b> current <b>menu</b> structure {{is based on}} the development history of the services rather than on an intuitive organization for the consumer. Four studies were performed to develop a new menu structure which would be easier for consumers to use. The first study used cluster analysis to develop a <b>menu</b> structure. <b>The</b> second experiment tested the goodness of fit of <b>the</b> new <b>menu</b> compared to <b>the</b> old <b>menu.</b> Results showed that consumers were more accurate in determining where on <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> a service would be found with <b>the</b> new <b>menu.</b> In <b>the</b> third experiment, we changed the name of one of <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> categories and got an even greater improvement i n performance. Finally, we tested <b>the</b> same three <b>menu</b> structures using a phone prototype rather than a paper task and the results were similar to those with the paper task. Consumers were 18 % more accurate in locating a service on <b>the</b> best new <b>menu</b> than on <b>the</b> existing <b>menu.</b> These results strongly suggest that changing <b>the</b> Rapid Order <b>menu</b> will result in improved customer performance with <b>the</b> <b>menu.</b> They also illustrate how cluster analysis alone will not provide all <b>the</b> answers in <b>menu</b> design. <b>The</b> labeling of the clusters can {{have a significant effect on}} the goodness of fit of <b>the</b> <b>menu...</b>|$|R
