40|$|Inner liner of a <b>tubeless</b> <b>tyre</b> is {{currently}} constructed using a speciality synthetic rubber called chlorobutyl rubber (CIIR). Blending of CIIR with natural rubber (NR) will enable to achieve improvement in physico-mechanical properties with a reduced compound cost. Also, use of CIIR/NR blends for inner liners are best at retaining air pressure and minimizing the temperature dependence of air permeability. The properly increase {{is enhanced by}} addition of a mix of carbon black and silica fillers, which are reinforcing fillers. One reason for carrying out this research is to enhance the market opportunities of NR by developing NR/CIIR blends to reach the end product requirements. In this study, different series of compounds were prepared, one with CIIR alone by varying the carbon black to silica ratio at 10 phr intervals, other with CIIR/NR blends by varying the CIIR to NR blend ratio at 20 % intervals. Total filler loading was kept constant at 60 phr. Melt viscosity, hardness, tensile strength, modulus at 300 % and tear strength increased with silica loading, while scorch time, abrasion volume loss and air permeability decreased above silica loading of 30 phr [...] Cure time did not show any variation with type of filler. When replacing CIIR with NR, cure rate index increased significantly from 40 % NR and hence the cure time decreased. Mechanical properties and air permeability varied significantly. Materials used for the inner liner mainly chlorobutyl rubber are very expensive and hence by using the above mentioned blend with the optimum filler loading, the production cost can be minimized. Results in overall showed optimum properties for the 20 : 80 CIIR/NR blend at 10 : 50 carbon black /silica filler ratio...|$|E
50|$|The Comstar wheel, {{sometimes}} referred to as Com-stars or stylised as ComStar, was a composite motorcycle wheel that Honda fitted to many of its motorcycles from 1977 to the mid 1980s. Its design allowed it the option of being fitted with <b>tubeless</b> <b>tyres</b> and its use on the Honda CX500 was the first time <b>tubeless</b> <b>tyres</b> had been designed for a production motorcycle.|$|R

5000|$|Other {{features}} include a dual side handle lock for ease in parking, a kick start mechanism {{that makes it}} possible to start the scooter while sitting, a luminous ignition key for better visibility, and <b>tubeless</b> <b>tyres.</b>|$|R
40|$|It is {{notoriously}} {{difficult to detect}} and measure faults {{below the surface of}} composite materials, such as carbon-fibre reinforced flaps for aircraft, radial tyres for lorries, and even sports shoes. Now a prototype laser-assisted inspection system can find and map hidden defects in vehicle tyres, dashboards and rubber-metal objects such as valves for <b>tubeless</b> <b>tyres.</b> The technology can cut the cost of quality inspections by 90 %...|$|R
5000|$|The early XBR500 {{was fitted}} with Comstar wheels and <b>tubeless</b> <b>tyres.</b> Later models were {{provided}} with spoked wheels and tubed tyres. A removable seat cover was also fitted in order to simulate a cafe-racer look. Honda subsequently released a café racer version of the XBR500, the Honda GB500 TT, which featured some [...] "classic British qualities", such as a solo seat, seat hump, wire wheels, and a fuel-tank with pinstriping.|$|R
50|$|The {{front brake}} {{was a single}} inboard {{ventilated}} disc that was developed to improve brake performance and feel. This was only seen on Honda models for a few years, before a switch to sintered metal brake pads with the more traditional disc/caliper arrangement. Other features included a hydraulic clutch, Comstar wheels with <b>tubeless</b> <b>tyres,</b> TRAC anti-dive front forks and Pro-Link rear suspension. Engine coolant passed {{through one of the}} frame tubes. The early UK specification model had built-in front fairing indicators, and optional radiator side-cowls and belly pan. Following the VT250F, the VT250 Spada and VTR250 were produced.|$|R
5000|$|The {{front wheels}} were {{suspended}} with double-wishbone connectors {{with coil springs}} and telescopic shock absorbers, and the back wheels on trailing arms with coil springs with and anti-roll bar. [...] The brakes, considered advanced at the time, were applied using a hydraulic linkage, with four light-alloy 200 mm brake drums. [...] The hand brake was operated mechanically and worked on the rear wheels. [...] Almost as innovative {{at the time was}} the specification of <b>Tubeless</b> <b>tyres</b> on the 13" [...] wheels. The rack and pinion steering required 3.36 between opposite locks, and the turning circle was 10.7 m.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in the UK in 1980 as the J1 version, their {{styling and}} spec {{was aimed at}} the sports touring market and as a {{competition}} against the Honda CB400/4 and CB550/4 series of successful UJM (universal Japanese motorcycle) middleweights.The 400 was almost the same in specs as the Z500 model but differed in {{that it had a}} rear drum brake instead of a disc.The J2 was fitted with air assisted forks, adjustable damping rear twin shocks, <b>tubeless</b> <b>tyres</b> in cast 7 spoke wheels, grab rail and different tank/seat cowl striping The J3 version was offered was Megaphone shortie silencers and chromed tops on the twin shocks. In 1983 the Z400 was altered significantly and the engine was heavily reworked resulting in the ZR400.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tubeless</b> tires or <b>tyres</b> (in some Commonwealth Nations) are {{pneumatic}} tires that do {{not require}} a separate inner tube.|$|R
50|$|Pneumatic tyres {{were invented}} by John Boyd Dunlop in 1888, {{and were in}} {{widespread}} use on bicycles and some early motorcycle prototypes by 1895. They were used on the first production motorcycle, the 1894-1897 Hildebrand & Wolfmüller, and have been on nearly all production and special motorcycles ever since. During this period tyre sizes were usually 22 to 28 in diameter and 1+1/2 to 2 in wide. The early wheels were spoked, made of all metal, or wood and metal, and used inner tubes to hold air. Flats were a constant problem; largely the fault of poor roads and not necessarily tyres. For easier repair, butt-ended or open ended inner tubes were used on some models, and some brands made rear wheels easier to detach. Spoked wheels with tubes remained standard until the 1970s, when solid, usually alloy, wheels began to appear and eventually dominate street motorcycles, making lighter <b>tubeless</b> <b>tyres</b> practical.|$|R

Later models also came with an aluminium box frame. The engine redlined at 13500 rpm. The engine also tends to heat up causing severe damage to the crankshaft bearings. It is advised to use only 10W/40 engine oil for v-twins and v-four engine motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|The Comstar was Honda's {{replacement}} for the tension spoked wheel. Whilst spoked wheels offered a degree of flexibility to help absorb road imperfections, they also required periodic maintenance to ensure correct spoke tension and required the fitment of an inner tube. Honda claimed the Comstar design combined {{the strength of a}} cast wheel but allowed a predetermined level of radial flex like spoked wheels. Comstar wheels also allowed the fitment of <b>tubeless</b> <b>tyres</b> which, like other alloy wheels, helped to reduce unsprung mass, although not all models fitted with Comstars had tubeless tyres.Honda debuted Comstars on their FIM European Motorcycle Endurance Championship winning RCB-941 production endurance race bikes for the 1976 season. Honda first fitted Comstars to its road going motorcycles in 1977 on models such as the CB400T Dream, CB750F2 and the later flagship CBX1000. A special lightweight version was also used on HRC's failed oval-piston four stroke GP motorcycle, the NR500, and the later NS500 two-stroke ridden by Freddie Spencer.|$|R
