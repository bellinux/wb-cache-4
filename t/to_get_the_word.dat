500|$|Novak was {{inspired}} to write the episode after attending an NBC sexual harassment seminar that {{the cast and crew}} had to attend before the series began. Many jokes and personal experiences involving sexual harassment were added into the script. This episode aired with a warning that it contained adult content and subject matter, which is rare for a network comedy. Novak explained that he had to fight NBC <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "boner" [...] on the air. One station refused to air the episode due to the language. [...] "Sexual Harassment" [...] received moderately positive reviews from television critics. The episode was viewed by 7.13 million viewers.|$|E
500|$|The Workshop devoted 8% {{of their}} initial budget to {{advertise}} the new show. [...] In what Morrow called [...] "an extensive campaign" [...] that Lesser stated [...] "would demand {{at least as}} much ingenuity as production and research", they promoted the show with educators and the broadcast industry. [...] The Workshop understood that a special effort had to be made to reach their target community because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> out to their target audience in the inner cities, they hired Evelyn Davis from the Urban League, whom Michael Davis called [...] "remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable", as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and head of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division.|$|E

5000|$|Bennett {{suffered}} from a stammer, which Somerset Maugham described as making it [...] "painful to watch the struggle he had sometimes <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> out."

500|$|When {{deciding}} what car Packer would own, writer B. J. Novak {{wanted to use}} a Mustang, but none were available. Producer Kent Zbornak decided to get Packer a red Chevrolet Corvette, which Novak now admits is [...] "even better". This episode aired with a warning that it contained adult content and subject matter, which is rare for a network comedy. Novak explained {{that he had to}} fight NBC <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "boner" [...] on the air because the replacement—"schwing"—didn't have, according to Novak, [...] "the same redemption for Michael at the end." [...] The disclaimer was a compromise. A station in Kentucky nevertheless refused to air this episode. Pam's mother was played by Shannon Cochran in this episode of the series, in the first appearance of the character {{at this point in the}} show. Cochran was unable to return to play the character for the season six episode [...] "Niagara", due to scheduling conflicts with a year-long theater contract, and was thus replaced by Linda Purl.|$|E
2500|$|Lurie {{said that}} Riordan had been {{approached}} about an imprint several years ago, but initially dismissed the idea {{because of his}} heavy workload. Later, he reported back {{that he had been}} [...] "toying with the idea", and was [...] "willing to go forward with a publishing line that was not a brand extension for his own work but a platform for Riordan to bring other great writers to the attention of his vast and loyal audience." [...] She also said that the imprint is planned to launch with two as-yet undetermined books. [...] "The point of making this announcement now is <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> out about what we’re looking for.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A new group, the Committee for Civic Progress, {{was formed}} to help promote the bond levy. Its members {{included}} 150 business, labor, real estate leaders. The group asked the City Council to send personal letters to their constituents, asking them to support the proposal. [...] All but three council members agreed to do so. The Greater Cleveland Convention and Visitors Bureau also helped. It issued a study in which it claimed that the convention center would generate $24 {{million a year in}} new economic activity, and printed 300,000 leaflets <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> out about the study's conclusions. Local radio and television stations donated time to the Committee for Civic Progress so it could run advertisements supporting the proposal.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his last}} bit of {{resistance}} to accepting the overthrow, Cleveland managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> for <b>the</b> Turpie Resolution changed {{to refer to the}} [...] "people" [...] rather than the [...] "Provisional Government", although the net effect was still a complete renunciation of his hopes to restore Queen Liliuokalani to power.|$|R

2500|$|On Friday morning, September 13, 2013, Patrick Foye, the {{executive}} director of the Port Authority and an appointee of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, ordered that the lanes be reopened in a strongly worded 7:44 AM e-mail to senior PA officials and staff, including Bill Baroni and David Samson. In the e-mail, Foye called the decision to close the lanes [...] "hasty and ill-advised", said that the decision violated policy and long-standing custom at the PA, and that he believed that closing the lanes [...] "violates Federal Law and the laws of both States." [...] Foye asked his spokesman <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> out. Upon learning this, Baroni attempted to prevent any disclosure in order to keep the public in the dark. Additionally, Baroni forwarded the e-mail to Regina Egea, Christie's Director of the authorities unit overseeing the PA, three hours after it was sent by Foye.|$|E

6000|$|A {{week later}} {{there was an}} unusually large party at mess, the depôts were very strong, and some forty {{officers}} sat down; and it being a guest night, four or five civilians were present. Dinner went on without incident until one of the mess waiters asked Wilmington whether he would take sirloin of beef or goose. He replied, [...] "B-b-b-b-beef." [...] There {{happened to be a}} slight lull in the conversation at the moment, and Wilmington's effort <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> out made him raise his voice so that it was generally heard.|$|E

5000|$|While {{serving as}} {{chairman}} of the county commission, Nuccio found a novel method of increasing his local name recognition. A strong proponent of neighborhood improvements, Nuccio managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "Nick C. Nuccio, County Commissioner" [...] stamped on every public works project he had approved. For several subsequent decades, his name was visible on sidewalks, park benches, seawalls, and virtually every other piece of concrete laid by Hillsborough County during his long tenure.|$|R

Now, if Mr. Wetmore were to criticise {{that picture}} he'd draw a circle round {{it in the}} air, {{and look at it}} through that, and tilt his head first on one side and then on the other, and then look at you, as if you were a figure in it, and then {{collapse}} awhile, and moan a little and gasp, 'Isn't your young lady a little too-too--' and then he'd try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> out of you, and groan and suffer some more; and you'd say, 'She is, rather,' and that would give him courage, and he'd say, 'I don't mean that she's so very--' 'Of course not.' 'You understand?' 'Perfectly. I see it myself, now.' 'Well, then'---and he'd take your pencil and begin to draw--'I should give her a little more--Ah?' 'Yes, I see the difference.'--'You see the difference?' And he'd go off to some one else, and you'd know that you'd been doing the wishy-washiest thing in the world, though he hadn't spoken a word of criticism, and couldn't. But he wouldn't have noticed the expression at all; he'd have shown you where your drawing was bad. He doesn't care for what he calls the literature of a thing; he says that {{will take care of itself}} if the drawing's good. He doesn't like my doing these chic things; but I'm going to keep it up, for I think it's the nearest way to illustrating." ...|$|E
5000|$|Malan was {{a crucial}} player in the move <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "British" [...] taken away from [...] "British Commonwealth". This change was taken as {{affirmation}} {{of the fact that}} all member countries were voluntary and equal members.|$|E

60|$|But {{this night}} the Dean's letters {{must have been}} {{difficult}} indeed to write. For he sat beside the table holding his pen and with his head bent upon his other hand, and though he sometimes put a line or two on the paper, {{for the most part}} he sat motionless. The fact is that Dean Drone was not trying to write letters, but only one letter. He was writing a letter of resignation. If you have not done that for forty years it is extremely difficult <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>words.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Amused by this purple passage, {{in a local}} bar, {{his colleagues}} decided to commemorate Flanders' {{achievement}} by forming the Order of the Occult Hand.

The editors were not happy about this mischief at all and ordered copy editors to be extremely vigilant, yet the phrase kept slipping into the paper and even into Down Beat, a jazz magazine, by Smith. The News revealed this tradition of high spirits, how it started, in 1985, when it went out of circulation.|$|R
