5|$|Both {{males and}} females utilize calls in alarm situations, {{especially}} in territorial disputes and encounters with predators. Males alone produce the cheer call, which can sound indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing pink or p'dink sound. Females {{are the only ones}} that can perform the paired dit-dit or chatter sounds. The former can be used in territorial disputes with predators, and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males cheer chant. <b>The</b> <b>chatter</b> is used exclusively with territorial encounters with male song, and the song can either follow or overlap her mate's song.|$|E

500|$|The song {{deals with}} a feminist theme of the war of the sexes. It is a [...] "feminist plea about women's place in history" [...] with the title {{referring}} to the [...] "cowardice of men". In the song, Farmer [...] "reverses the roles", and [...] "presents women as warriors". In the first couplet, she evokes [...] "the {{role of women in}} History", recalling that [...] "all the great men had on their side a woman to support, assist and advise them". However, the singer said that [...] "all this was done to the detriment of women and cites as example, Mary, Jesus Christ's mother, a symbol of martyrdom and self-sacrifice". She denounces [...] "the hypocrisy and <b>the</b> <b>chatter</b> of men who think only about power and sex". In the refrain, she advises women to rebel by taking up arms.|$|E

500|$|The {{start of}} the war in September 1939 alarmed many Americans, but the {{majority}} thought the U.S. should not get involved. Willkie spoke often about the threat to America and the need to aid Britain and other Allies. Willkie biographer Steve Neal wrote that the war [...] "transformed Willkie from a big-business critic of the New Deal into a champion of freedom. And it gave his candidacy new purpose." [...] Despite <b>the</b> <b>chatter</b> about Willkie, there were many who were skeptical about his chances should he seek the nomination. Kenneth F.

500|$|One {{source of}} Rodgers's {{excitement}} for {{the concept that}} became Me and Juliet was his view that a contemporary musical gave him {{the opportunity for a}} contemporary score. At the time Rodgers wrote the score, a Latin dance craze had swept the United States, and its influence found its way into the music for Me and Juliet. Rodgers put an onstage jazz trio in the production and encouraged the members to improvise. Among the trio was jazz artist Barbara Carroll as Chris, rehearsal pianist. [...] "Intermission Talk", <b>the</b> <b>chatter</b> among audience members early in the second act, is given a bouncy melody and sly references to a number of shows then on Broadway—including the duo's own The King and I.

Another CO19 squad, as well as Lucas and Jo Portman (Miranda Raison) follow the cell members to a street market, which they will use to maximise civilian casualties. Ben admits he is MI5 to Jawad, who runs in panic and attempts to manually detonate his bomb; this results in getting gunned down by CO19 officers, much to Ben's dismay.

500|$|Following [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] on the Sgt. Pepper album (as first {{released}} on LP in the UK and years later worldwide on CD) is a high-frequency 15-kilohertz tone and some randomly spliced Beatles studio chatter. The frequency is {{best understood as}} what we know as a dog whistle as the frequency is {{picked up by a}} dog's ear and was part of their humour. They joked about picturing barking dogs should they be present when the album would finish. [...] Recorded two months after the mono and stereo masters for [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] had been finalised, the studio chatter (titled in the session notes [...] "Edit for LP End") was added to the run-out groove of the initial British pressing. There are even a few variations of <b>the</b> <b>chatter,</b> though the best known one is them saying during the laughter and chatter [...] "never could see any other way." [...] The Anthology 2 album includes an early, pre-orchestral version of the song and Anthology 3 includes a version of [...] "The End" [...] that concludes by having the last note fade into the final chord of [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] (reversed, then played forwards). The Love version has the song starting with Lennon's intro of [...] "sugar plum fairy", with the strings being more prominent during the crescendos.|$|E
500|$|Another New York nightclub owner, Tex Guinan, {{introduced}} Billingsley to her friend, {{the entertainment}} and gossip columnist Walter Winchell, in 1930. In September 1930, Winchell called the Stork Club [...] "New York's New Yorkiest place on W. 58th" [...] in his New York Daily Mirror column. That evening, the Stork Club {{was filled with}} moneyed guests. Someone else who read Winchell's column in 1930 was singer-actress Helen Morgan, who had just finished filming a movie on Long Island. [...] Morgan decided to hold a cast party at the Stork Club, paying the tab with two $1,000 bills. Winchell became a regular at the Stork Club; what he saw and heard there at his private Table 50 was {{the basis of his}} newspaper columns and radio broadcasts. Billingsley also kept professionals on his staff whose job was to listen to <b>the</b> <b>chatter,</b> determine fact from rumor, and then report the factual news to local columnists. The practice was seen as protective of the patrons by shielding them from unfounded reports, and also a continual source of publicity for the club. Billingsley's long-standing relationship with Ethel Merman which began in 1939, brought the theater crowd to the Stork; there she had a waiter assigned to her whose job was just to light her cigarettes. Billingsley later wrote that Merman had offered him $500,000 to leave his wife and that he turned down the offer.|$|E
500|$|By being {{composed}} using {{nothing more}} than a Rhodes piano, a vocal sample, and turntable scratches, [...] "Everything I Am" [...] stands as the third studio album's most minimalistic production. West marries a down-tempo beat to gentle piano chords which are accentuated by soulful cooing sampled from [...] "If We Can't Be Lovers" [...] by Prince Phillip Mitchell. The low-key track has a scratched hook by DJ Premier formed with the vocal sample, which contains the line, [...] "Here we go again", that is lifted from [...] "Bring the Noise" [...] by Public Enemy. With its thick, heavy bass-line pattern, [...] "The Glory" [...] is an up-tempo number which revisits the [...] "chipmunk-soul" [...] that once defined Kanye's early production style. It displays a sped-up and high-pitched vocal sample of [...] "Save The Country" [...] by Laura Nyro accompanied by uplifting strings, keys, and an all-male gospel choir. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin sings the chorus and supplies a gospel-style piano motif while West raps over heavy yet buoyant drums on [...] "Homecoming." [...] <b>The</b> <b>chatter</b> of a noisy, cheering crowd can inexplicably be heard lurking in the background throughout the track. The Jay-Z ode [...] "Big Brother" [...] begins with West uttering the words, [...] "Stadium status...," [...] backed by a string orchestra, pounding drums, a distorted guitar riff and plinking piano keys. Around mid-verse, the track adopts synths that mimic the melodies of the string section. Before the second verse, additional instrumentation enters; including a heavy bass-line, metallic percussion, and 808-handclaps. The studio album's final track [...] "Good Night" [...] exhibits the production characteristics of West's next musical evolution. West juxtaposes the glitchy, mechanical sound of an 8-bit beat with the more elegant, traditional sound of a classical piano.|$|E

40|$|In {{conventional}} sliding-mode control systems, the sliding-mode {{motion is}} of reduced order. Two main problems hindering {{the application of}} the sliding-mode control are the singularity in terminal sliding-mode control systems and <b>the</b> <b>chattering</b> in both <b>the</b> conventional linear sliding-mode and the terminal sliding-mode control systems. This paper proposes a chattering-free full-order terminal-sliding-mode control scheme. Since the derivatives of terms with fractional powers do not appear in the control law, the control singularities are avoided. A continuous control strategy is developed to achieve <b>the</b> <b>chattering</b> free sliding-mode control. During the ideal sliding-mode motion, the systems behave as a desirable full-order dynamics rather than a desirable reduced-order dynamics. A systematic design method of full-order sliding-mode control for nonlinear systems is presented, which allows both <b>the</b> <b>chattering</b> and singularity problems to be resolved. Simulations validate <b>the</b> proposed <b>chattering</b> free full-order sliding-mode control...|$|R

When <b>the</b> <b>chattering</b> is reduced, <b>the</b> back emf can be obtained directly from the switching signal. Thus, the low pass filters may not be necessary to extract the low-frequency back emfs. As a result, the delay time due to low pass filters would not be appeared in this proposed observer. Then, the estimated rotor position would not necessarily be compensated as well. As a result, the proposed sliding mode observer simplifies sliding mode observer with minimal parameter adjustments. The overall system will be implemented on the TMS 320 F 2812 based digital controller.
