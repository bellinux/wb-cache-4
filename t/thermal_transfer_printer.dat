50|$|A <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>printer</b> {{contains}} a ribbon cartridge {{that uses a}} wax ink. When the heating elements in the print head heat up, they melt the wax and transfer it to the paper, thus {{the need for the}} paper to be really smooth. This also means that the ribbon cannot be reused after the head runs over it, since the wax transfers off the ribbon to the paper.|$|E
5000|$|The Magnavox VideoWRITER a.k.a. the Philips VideoWRITER was a {{standalone}} fixed-application {{word processing}} machine (electronic typewriter), {{which included a}} CRT amber screen with a wide aspect ratio (i.e. more than 4:3), {{a black and white}} <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>printer,</b> a 3.5" [...] floppy drive for saving documents, and dedicated computing hardware, all enclosed in a single case. The keyboard was separate and a custom design whose unusual features included a style key and not just an undo key but also a do key. With its dedicated word processing firmware, the VideoWRITER was not a freely programmable computer but a typewriter replacement appliance. It was not a lap-top machine but was designed to be transportable in either a cloth or hard plastic carry case accessory.|$|E
5000|$|MIL-STD-130 {{standard}} requires qualifying government furnished {{property in}} possession of contractors (PIPC), and qualifying end item deliverables or legacy items to be marked with a machine readable 2D Data Matrix bar code. There are several allowed methods for marking, the most common being a polyester or polymide label marked with a <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>printer</b> (the cheapest is about $3,000). Other methods are: metal nameplate laser etched, metal plate metalphoto processed, direct part-marked by dot peen, ink jet, laser etch or chemical etch. The bar code must meet several quality specifications, pass a verification process with a grade of 'B' or better, and [...] "be as permanent as the normal life expectancy of the item and be capable of withstanding the environmental tests and cleaning procedures specified for the item {{to which it is}} affixed". A full list of suggested marking methods are outlined in Table II of MIL-STD-130N.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} barcode {{printers}} employ {{one of two}} different printing technologies. Direct thermal printers use a printhead to generate heat that causes a chemical reaction in specially designed paper that turns the paper black. <b>Thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>printers</b> also use heat, but instead of reacting the paper, the heat melts a waxy or resin substance on a ribbon that runs over the label or tag material. The heat transfers ink from the ribbon to the paper. Direct thermal printers are generally less expensive, but they produce labels that can become illegible if exposed to heat, direct sunlight, or chemical vapors.|$|R
50|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> {{printing}} is {{a digital}} printing {{process in which}} material is applied to paper (or some other material) by melting a coating of ribbon so that it stays glued to the material on which the print is applied.

50|$|Construction of the Charles Stratton Dana Greenhouses {{began in}} May 1961 and the {{facility}} was operational by March 1962. The project {{was made possible}} by a generous donation by Martha Dana, who divided the income of her estate equally between the Arnold Arboretum, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. The donation to the Arboretum honored her father and his lasting interest in the institution. The four-and-a-half-acre plot contains a main building with four attached glasshouses measuring 17x51 feet each, a cold storage house, a bonsai house containing the Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection, a permanent shade house, and four nurseries. The main building contains work space with potting benches, vulcathane-surfaced tables, stainless steel sinks and computer stations with a <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>printer</b> for label-making, a cold storage room for seed stratification and propagule storage, a laboratory for cytological and morphological research, a conference room, office space, a small library, and a lunch room with complete locker facilities for staff.|$|E
50|$|Solid ink printers, {{also known}} as phase-change printers, are a type of <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>printer.</b> They use solid sticks of CMYK-coloured ink, similar in {{consistency}} to candle wax, which are melted and fed into a piezo crystal operated print-head. The printhead sprays the ink on a rotating, oil coated drum. The paper then passes over the print drum, at which time the image is immediately transferred, or transfixed, to the page. Solid ink printers are most commonly used as colour office printers, and are excellent at printing on transparencies and other non-porous media. Solid ink printers can produce excellent results. Acquisition and operating costs are similar to laser printers. Drawbacks of the technology include high energy consumption and long warm-up times from a cold state. Also, some users complain that the resulting prints are difficult to write on, as the wax tends to repel inks from pens, and are difficult to feed through automatic document feeders, but these traits have been significantly reduced in later models. In addition, this type of printer is only available from one manufacturer, Xerox, manufactured {{as part of their}} Xerox Phaser office printer line. Previously, solid ink printers were manufactured by Tektronix, but Tek sold the printing business to Xerox in 2001.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{spectral}} prediction model {{as well as}} new approaches for modeling ink spreading which occurs when printing ink layer superpositions. The spectral prediction model enhances the classical Clapper-Yule model by taking into account the fact that proportionally more incident light through a given colorant surface is reflected back onto the same colorant surface than onto other colorant surfaces. This is expressed by a weighted mean between a component specifying the part of the incident light which exits through the same colorant as the colorant from which it enters (Saunderson corrected Neugebauer component) and a component specifying the part of the incident light whose emerging light components exit from all colorants, with a probability to exit from a given colorant equal to that colorant surface coverage (Clapper-Yule component). We also propose two models for taking into account ink spreading, a phenomenon which occurs when printing an ink halftone in superposition with one or several solid inks. Besides the physical dot gain present within a single ink halftone print, we consider in the first model the ink spreading which occurs when an ink halftone is printed on top of one or two solid inks. In the second more advanced model, we generalize this concept to ink halftones printed on top or below solid inks. We formulate for both ink spreading models systems of equations which allow to compute effective ink coverages as a combination of the individual ink coverages which occur in the different superposition cases. The new spectral prediction model combined with advanced ink spreading yields excellent spectral predictions for clustered-dot color halftone prints, both in the case of offset (75 to 150 lpi) {{and in the case of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>printers</b> (50 to 75 lpi) ...|$|R

The <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) signals of bleached samples of sedimentary quartz are investigated using repeated heat/OSL measurement cycles with different heating temperatures ranging from 200 to 360 degrees.

40|$|Major {{concerns}} in the dating of samples younger than a few hundred years by the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) technique are <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> and partial bleaching. <b>Thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> during preheating enhances the OSL signal due to the charge transfer from thermally sensitive, but light-insensitive, traps to optical centres of quartz and results in an overestimate in equivalent dose, especially for very young samples. In this study, the single-aliquot regenerative-dose protocol is used to obtain values of equivalent dose (D-e) from young samples taken from various environments around Istanbul. Within this framework, we aim to investigate the effect of preheat temperature on equivalent dose from 150 to 300 degrees C, the reproducibility of De measurements for young deposits and the contribution from <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> of charge to the equivalent dose estimation. It was observed that the measured dose is influenced significantly by preheat temperature {{and the increase in}} the De is clearly due to <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> of charge from deep thermally sensitive traps to OSL trap during preheating of the samples prior to the main OSL measurements.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{optically}} stimulated luminescence (OSL) signals created by basic <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer.</b> The <b>thermal</b> stabilities of trapped charges associated with the source traps of <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> and their related OSL traps, and trapped holes associated with non-luminescent centres (R centres) were studied for a sedimentary quartz, using isothermal annealing and pulse annealing methods. The thermally transferred charges are mainly from three groups of traps (source traps), shallow, medium and deep traps. Kinetic analysis indicates that the medium and deep source traps have trap depths of ∼ 1. 1 eV and ∼ 1. 5 eV, and lifetimes 7. 6 × 105 and 6. 0 × 1011 years at 20 °C, respectively. Two kinds of OSL traps, one unstable and the other stable, are identified as accepting charges during <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer.</b> These OSL traps have different thermal stabilities from the main OSL traps, which {{are associated with the}} 325 °C TL peak. The results also indicate that the basic <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> related OSL signals perhaps use different R centres from the dose-generated fast bleachable OSL signals. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
