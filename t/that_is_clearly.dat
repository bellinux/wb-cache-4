5|$|Purring {{may have}} {{developed}} as an evolutionary advantage {{as a sign}}alling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing kittens. Post-nursing cats often purr {{as a sign of}} contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed, or eating. The mechanism by which cats purr is elusive. The cat has no unique anatomical feature <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> responsible for the sound. It was, until recent times, believed that only the cats of the Felis genus could purr. However, felids of the Panthera genus (tiger, lion, jaguar, and leopard) also produce sounds similar to purring, but only when exhaling.|$|E
5|$|Van Eyck's {{earlier work}} often shows churches and cathedrals in older Romanesque style, {{sometimes}} {{to represent the}} Temple in Jerusalem as an appropriate historical setting, with decoration drawn exclusively from the Old Testament. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> not the case here – the Christ Child occupies the same space as a large rood cross depicting him being crucified. The church in this panel is contemporary Gothic – a choice perhaps intended to associate Mary with the Ecclesia Triumphans – while her pose and oversized scale are indebted to the forms and conventions of Byzantine art and the International Gothic. Van Eyck details the architecture with a precision not seen before in northern European painting.|$|E

25|$|A boot is {{a special}} type of shoe which covers the foot and the ankle and extends up the leg, {{sometimes}} {{as far as the}} knee or even the hip. Most boots have a heel <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> distinguishable {{from the rest of the}} sole, even if the two are made of one piece. They are typically made of leather or rubber, although they may be made from a variety of different materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality— protecting the foot and leg from water, snow, mud or hazards or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities— as well as for reasons of style and fashion.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the legal}} system is assumed to contain some earlier law {{influenced}} by the church, and adaptation through methods of reasoning the Irish jurists would have sanctioned. There is dispute, however, as to just how large a role each of these aspects may have played in creating the legal texts. The subject is an important scope for debate. There is, however, one area where scholars have found material <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> old. A number of legal terms {{have been shown to}} have originated in the period before the Celtic Languages split up because they are preserved in both Old Irish and in the Welsh legal texts. On the other hand, this is not regarded as unquestionable evidence that the practices described by such terms are unchanged or even have their origins in the same period as do the terms.|$|E
25|$|There are {{numerous}} sexually explicit paintings and sculptures from the ruined Roman buildings in Pompeii and Herculaneum but the original {{purposes of the}} depictions can vary. On one hand, in the Villa of the Mysteries, there is a ritual flagellation scene <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> associated with a religious cult and this image {{can be seen as}} having religious significance rather than sexual. On the other hand, graphic paintings in a brothel advertise sexual services in murals above each door. In Pompeii, phalli and testicles engraved in the sidewalks were created to aid visitors in finding their way by pointing to the prostitution and entertainment district as well as general decoration. The Romans considered depictions of sex to be decoration in good taste, and indeed the pictures reflect the sexual mores and practices of their culture, as on the Warren Cup. Sex acts that were considered taboo (such as those that defiled the purity of the mouth) were depicted in baths for comic effect. Large phalli were often used near entryways, for the phallus was a good-luck charm, and the carvings were common in homes. One of the first objects excavated when the complex was discovered was a marble statue showing the god Pan having sex with a goat, a detailed depiction of bestiality considered so obscene that it was not on public display until the year 2000 and remains in the Secret Museum, Naples.|$|E

500|$|Despite his {{quotations}} from Christian authors {{and from the}} Bible, William did not place much emphasis on the intervention of God in human affairs, resulting in a somewhat [...] "secular" [...] history. Nevertheless, he included much information <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> legendary, especially when referring to the First Crusade, which even in his own day was already considered an age of great Christian heroes. Expanding on the accounts of Albert of Aix, Peter the Hermit is given prominence in the preaching of the First Crusade, {{to the point that}} it was he, not Pope Urban II, who originally conceived the crusade. Godfrey of Bouillon, the first ruler of crusader Jerusalem, was also depicted as the leader of the crusade from the beginning, and William attributed to him legendary strength and virtue. This reflected the almost mythological status that Godfrey and the other first crusaders held for the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the late twelfth century.|$|E

500|$|When the Tea Room {{was closed}} by the National Park Service on January 1, 1999, {{officials}} said they did so {{because of the potential}} fire hazard posed by operating a kitchen in the main park building and the possibility of insect or rodent damage to historic items in the mansion, as stated in the General Management Plan adopted by the NPS the previous year. While it [...] "may be a pleasant place to enjoy a meal... <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> less important than the need to preserve Hampton's buildings, objects and landscapes for future generations," [...] the Park Service stated. Officials of Preservation Maryland said they were [...] "disappointed" [...] by the restaurant's closure, saying it helped attract visitors to the historic site. The former chairwoman of the Hampton women's committee—which raises money for various projects at Hampton—also criticized the decision. Since 2006, the women's group has renewed efforts to have the Tea Room reopened, saying it would draw more visitors and repeat business from locals to the park. A Park Service spokesman was quoted as saying in October, 2006, that [...] "The mansion {{is not going to be}} the site of any food operation," [...] but has made no further comment since then.|$|E
500|$|Leo Depuydt of Brown University {{found it}} ridiculous {{that in the}} Gospel of Jesus' Wife, the word [...] "my" [...] in the phrase [...] "my wife" [...] is written in bold, as if to stress the idea that Jesus was married. Depuydt {{also said that he}} had never seen bold writing used in a single Coptic text before. He wrote: “The effect is {{something}} like: ‘My wife. Get it? MY wife. You heard that right.’ The papyrus fragment seems ripe for a Monty Python sketch…. If the forger had used italics in addition, one might be in danger of losing one’s composure.” Christian Askeland's linguistic analysis of the text shows that it is in a dialect which fell out of use well before AD 741. He concluded that the text must have been written on a fragment of medieval papyrus by a modern forger. Dr. Askeland also found it suspicious that the author of the fragment wrote the same letter in different ways. In addition, Askeland showed that the fragment is [...] "a match for a papyrus fragment <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> a forgery." [...] This second fragment, containing part of the Gospel of John, belongs to the same anonymous owner, and is now overwhelmingly considered a fake. This is because that fragment of the Gospel of John appeared to have been copied from every second line of an online translation of John's Gospel in an ancient Coptic dialect called Lycopolitan; also, the Lycopolitan language died out prior to the sixth century, and the John fragment was carbon-dated to somewhere between the seventh and ninth centuries. Askeland argues that the John fragment was written by the same person, in the same ink, and with the same instrument as the Gospel of Jesus' Wife. [...] Professor King felt that these concerns were legitimate, but that there was still a chance that the gospel was authentic. The Atlantic reported that despite Kings' reservations, the text was widely considered a fake. King later conceded, saying that evidence suggests that the Gospel of Jesus' Wife is a forgery.|$|E
