5|$|A {{week before}} the game's release, it became known that an {{agreement}} to include EAX audio technology in Doom 3 reached by id Software and Creative Labs was heavily influenced by a software patent owned by the latter company. The patent dealt with a technique for rendering shadows called Carmack's Reverse, which was developed independently by both John Carmack and programmers at Creative Labs. id Software would have placed themselves under legal liability for using the technique in the finished game, so to defuse the issue, id Software agreed <b>to</b> <b>license</b> Creative Labs sound technologies in exchange for indemnification against lawsuits.|$|E
50|$|The {{games that}} had to be altered due <b>to</b> <b>licensing</b> issues are Jungle Hunt and Rainbow Islands.

Rainbow Islands had to alter its music for the re-release due <b>to</b> <b>licensing.</b>|$|R

5|$|By late June , Donkey Kongs success had {{prompted}} {{more than}} 50 {{parties in the}} U.S. and Japan <b>to</b> <b>license</b> the game's characters. Mario and his simian nemesis appeared on cereal boxes, board games, pajamas, and manga. In 1983, the animation studio Ruby-Spears produced a Donkey Kong cartoon (as well as Donkey Kong Jr.) for the Saturday Supercade program on CBS. In the show, mystery crime-solving plots {{in the mode of}} Scooby-Doo are framed around the premise of Mario and Pauline chasing Donkey Kong (voiced by Soupy Sales), who has escaped from the circus. The show lasted two seasons.|$|E
5|$|European {{companies}} which bought foreign patents the Wrights {{had received}} sued other manufacturers in their countries. Those lawsuits were only partly successful. Despite a pro-Wright ruling in France, legal maneuvering dragged {{on until the}} patent expired in 1917. A German court ruled the patent not valid because of prior disclosure in speeches by Wilbur Wright in 1901 and Chanute in 1903. In the U.S. the Wrights made {{an agreement with the}} Aero Club of America <b>to</b> <b>license</b> airshows which the Club approved, freeing participating pilots from a legal threat. Promoters of approved shows paid fees to the Wrights.|$|E

5|$|In New York Times Co. v. Tasini (1997), {{freelance}} journalists {{sued the}} New York Times Company for copyright infringement for the New York Times inclusion in an electronic archival database (LexisNexis) {{of the work}} of freelancers it had published. Sotomayor ruled that the publisher had the right <b>to</b> <b>license</b> the freelancers' work. This decision was reversed on appeal, and the Supreme Court upheld the reversal; two dissenters (John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer) took Sotomayor's position.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Cumberland Presbytery, also {{within the}} Kentucky Synod, faced a {{shortage}} of ministers and decided <b>to</b> <b>license</b> clergy candidates who were less educated than was typical and who could not subscribe completely to the Westminster Confession. In 1805, the synod suspended many of these ministers, even bringing heresy charges against a number of them, and by 1806 the synod had dissolved the presbytery. In 1810, ministers dissatisfied with {{the actions of the}} synod formed the Cumberland Presbyterian Church (CPC). The CPC subscribed to a modified form of the Westminster Confession that rejected the Calvinist doctrines of double predestination and limited atonement.|$|E
5|$|On June 29, 1982, Universal officially sued Nintendo. The {{company also}} {{announced}} that it had agreed <b>to</b> <b>license</b> the rights to King Kong to Coleco. On January 3, 1983, Universal then sent cease-and-desist letters to Nintendo's licensees offering three options: stop using Donkey Kong characters, obtain a license from Universal, or be sued. Six licensees caved, but Milton Bradley refused to do so. When Ralston Purina's offer of $5,000 {{for the use of}} Donkey Kong characters on breakfast cereal was turned down, they also refused to settle.|$|E

5|$|Production of the No. 20 resumed around 1947, {{at which}} time the company began <b>to</b> <b>license</b> the Oliver name to several European {{manufacturing}} companies. The standard desktop machine was eventually discontinued in favor of portable models; the company began to sell a German design, the Siemag Standard, as the Oliver standard. In 1958, Oliver purchased the Byron Typewriter Company, previously the Barlock Typewriter Company, of Nottingham. The licensing ventures were ultimately unsuccessful, and the company's machine tools were transferred to a factory in Germany. Production of all Oliver typewriters ended in May 1959.|$|E

The federal government refused <b>to</b> <b>license</b> any private broadcaster until the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{had created a}} national network.

The success of the web caught them by surprise and they subsequently approached Spyglass <b>to</b> <b>license</b> their browser as Internet Explorer.

However, Microsoft sold no copies of Internet Explorer, choosing instead to bundle it for free with the operating system.|$|E
5|$|Duke Nukem Forever {{was officially}} {{announced}} on April 28, 1997, {{with the intention}} of releasing the game no later than mid-1998. Barely a year after the release of Duke Nukem 3D, the game's graphics and its game engine, the Build engine, were antiquated. Id Software's new Quake II engine was far superior to Build, so Broussard decided <b>to</b> <b>license</b> it. The price spent for the licensing rights was steep—estimates were as high as $500,000—but Broussard reasoned that it would save time used to write a game engine from scratch. Broussard and Miller were flush with cash from the sales of Duke Nukem 3D and other games, so they decided to fund Duke Nukem Forever themselves, turning marketing and publishing rights over to GT Interactive.|$|E

5|$|Elite Force was one {{of several}} Star Trek games {{announced}} after Activision secured the license to Star Trek video games from Viacom in 1998. The game {{was one of}} the first <b>to</b> <b>license</b> id Tech 3, a game engine by id Software used by a number of video games during the early 2000s. Elite Force was a critical success, and is often praised as the first truly successful Star Trek video game, able to appeal to people who were not Star Trek fans. Raven Software released an expansion pack to the game in May 2001, while Wildstorm adapted the story for a short graphic novel in July 2000. A sequel developed by Ritual Entertainment, , was published in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Following Strawberry Panic!s {{first run}} in Dengeki G's Magazine {{it was six}} months before results began to {{indicate}} that the series was a success, and that its fans were growing in number; the manga and light novels which followed were a reflection of its popularity. The series became sufficiently popular for Seven Seas Entertainment <b>to</b> <b>license</b> the manga series and light novels for English language distribution. Strawberry Panic! was one of the debut titles on the company's light novel and yuri manga production lines. An anime series was produced in 2006 by Madhouse and is licensed by Media Blasters. A visual novel was produced in 2006 by MediaWorks for the PlayStation 2.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 for the PlayStation Vita in 2012, Marvel's new parent company, The Walt Disney Company, which {{acquired}} Marvel in 2009, chose not to renew Capcom's license with the Marvel characters, instead opting {{to put them in}} its own self-published Disney Infinity series. As a result, Capcom had to pull both Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Marvel vs. Capcom 2 off their online platforms in 2013. However, in 2016, Disney announced its decision to cancel the Disney Infinity series, discontinue self-publishing efforts, and switch to a licensing-only model, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>license</b> their characters to third-party game developers, including Capcom. Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite was revealed in December 2016, and then released in September 2017.|$|E
