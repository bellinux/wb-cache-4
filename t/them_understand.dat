In 1936 Berkeley promoted him to full professor at a salary of $3300 per annum. In return {{he was asked to}} curtail his teaching at Caltech, so a compromise was reached whereby Berkeley released him for six weeks each year, enough to teach one term at Caltech.|$|E
5|$|Early {{concepts}} {{were very}} different from the final film. The initial version featured a floating castle with two brothers vying to inherit their father's kingdom, and when the brothers fell to Earth, they encountered a tall bird who helped <b>them</b> <b>understand</b> each other. Docter's next idea introduced many of the elements that eventually made their way into the film, but had Carl and Russell landing the house on a Soviet-era spy airship camouflaged as a giant cloud rather than on a tepui. This concept was rewritten due to its similarity to another idea Pixar was developing. Another idea Docter added, then removed, was magic fountain-of-youth eggs laid by the bird, in order to explain the age discrepancy between Muntz and Carl, but it was decided that this subplot was too distracting, and that people would forgive the minor inconsistency.|$|E

5|$|Stanton {{also wanted}} the {{lighting}} to look realistic and evoke the science fiction films of his youth. He thought that Pixar captured {{the physics of}} being underwater with Finding Nemo and so for WALL-E, he wanted to push that for air. While rewatching some of his favorite science fiction films, he realized that Pixar's other movies had lacked the look of 70 mm film and its barrel distortion, lens flare, and racking focus. Producer Jim Morris invited Roger Deakins and Dennis Muren to advise on lighting and atmosphere. Muren spent several months with Pixar, while Deakins hosted one talk and was requested to stay on for another two weeks. Stanton said Muren's experience came from integrating computer animation into live-action settings, while Deakins helped <b>them</b> <b>understand</b> not to overly complicate their camerawork and lighting. 1970s Panavision cameras were used to help the animators understand and replicate handheld imperfections like unfocused backgrounds in digital environments. The first lighting test included building a three-dimensional replica of WALL-E, filming it with a 70mm camera, {{and then trying to}} replicate that in the computer. Stanton cited the shallow lens work of Gus Van Sant's films as an influence, as it created intimacy in each close-up. Stanton chose angles for the virtual cameras that a live-action filmmaker would choose if filming on a set.|$|E

25|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on talking to the Turks, Ribbentrop and Papen became entangled in a feud over Papen's demand that he by-pass Ribbentrop and send his dispatches straight to Hitler. As a former Chancellor, Papen had granted this privilege of by-passing the Foreign Minister while he was Ambassador to Austria. Ribbentrop's friendship with Papen, which went back to 1918, ended over this issue. At the same time, Ribbentrop took to shouting at the Turkish Ambassador in Berlin, Mehemet Hamdi Arpag, {{as part of the}} effort to win Turkey over as a German ally. Ribbentrop believed that Turks were so stupid that only by shouting at them could one make <b>them</b> <b>understand.</b> One of the consequences of Ribbentrop's heavy-handed behaviour was the signing of the Anglo-Turkish alliance of 12 May 1939.|$|E

The Stones considered their own performance lacklustre, and the project was never broadcast. The Who had not released an album in over a year, and had not completed the recording of Tommy, which continued well into 1969, interspersed with gigs at weekends.

King has become a national icon in the history of American liberalism and American progressivism. King also influenced Irish politician and activist John Hume.

500|$|While {{attending}} the Friedrichstadt Teacher College, Maeser {{was exposed to}} Pestalozzian educational theory, which greatly influenced his educational philosophy. Pestalozzian educational theory recognizes the potential of each individual. Pestalozzi encouraged teachers to treat their students with kindness and respect, and to show love to their students, instead of evoking fear. Pestalozzi was also in favor of universal education and opposed separately educating different social classes. Maeser adopted many of his ideas. He supported the education of women. Maeser believed that students {{should be allowed to}} express themselves freely and choose their own careers. His lectures tried to engage students and help <b>them</b> <b>understand</b> concepts through their own experiences. He also included many object lessons to coach students to observe their surroundings and make connections. Maeser admired Prestalozzian teachers Adolph Diesterweg and Friedrich Fröbel Maeser also agreed that [...] "education should be balanced head, heart and hand." ...|$|E

Hogben and Gelardin has been associated for the past 10 years with Gaga, working on different projects. Stylistically, collaborating on Joanne was a different experience for them. They were present in the recording studio with the singer and Ronson during conception of several tracks and the album's journey helped <b>them</b> <b>understand</b> Gaga's intent with the music. Since [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] is an [...] "energetic" [...] track they wanted the video to reflect that. It was Gaga's idea to envision the clip as a performance, which became the starting point for Gelardin and Hogben. They wanted her to perform in between people instead on a stage, and asked Ronson, Parker and BloodPop to play cameos. While being interviewed by V magazine, the directors elaborated further: ...|$|E
