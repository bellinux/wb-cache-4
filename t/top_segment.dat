A combined list consists of <b>top</b> <b>segments</b> of various sizes from each base list so that the total size of all <b>top</b> <b>segments</b> equals N. A sequence of item requests is processed and the goal is to minimize the total number of misses. That is, we seek to build a combined list that contains all the frequently requested items.

In addition, we develop a randomized online algorithm whose expected number of misses is close to that of the best combined list chosen in hindsight. We prove lower bounds that show that the expected number of misses of our randomized algorithm is close to the optimum. In the presence of duplicate items, we show that computing the best combined list is NP-hard. We show that our algorithms still apply to a linearized notion of loss in this case. We expect that this new way of aggregating lists will find many ranking applications. ...|$|R

One side is about 47 m long and the other two faces about 81 m long. There may have been about eighty ground floor rooms in this block, twenty-five rooms on the second story and fourteen subterranean kivas.

50|$|According to a 2002 study {{commissioned}} by the ILO, the connection between employment in the informal economy and being poor is stronger for women than men. While men tend to be over-represented in the <b>top</b> <b>segment</b> of the informal sector, women overpopulate the bottom segment. Men {{are more likely to}} have larger-scale operations and deal in non-perishable items while few women are employers who hire others. Instead, women are more likely to be involved in smaller-scale operations and trade food items. Women are under-represented in higher-income employment positions in the informal economy and over-represented in lower-income statuses. As a result, the gender gap in terms of wage is higher in the informal sector than the formal sector. Labor markets, household decisions, and states all propagate this gender inequality.|$|E
