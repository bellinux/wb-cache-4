2500|$|Since its {{inception}} the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating {{the promotion of}} female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, {{in which they could}} become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The modern Brazilian Bahá'í community has members and activities and external interests in issues affecting the religion. And the community continues programs of outreach. In 1986 the Brazilian Society of Physicians for Peace was formed on the initiative of a number of Bahá'í physicians (some 120 medical professionals attend the convocation.) In 2002 the National Spiritual Assembly prepared a list of some 44 names of national religious leaders, theologians, and religious academics, and then sent the letter Letter to the World's Religious Leaders out by mail or personal delivery. As a second step, some 330 copies of the letter were sent to the local Spiritual Assemblies in Brazil, for distribution to local religious leaders. [...] "In Brazilian society, religious divisions are a problem," [...] said Roberto Eghrari, secretary of external affairs for the Brazilian National Spiritual Assembly. [...] "There are tensions between evangelical groups and other Christian denominations, and between Christians and Afro-based religious groups. So we believe the distribution of this message is very timely, that {{it has the potential to}} bring new understandings." [...] Mr. Eghrari said religious leaders have acted with much appreciation. Several groups had indicated a desire for some kind of collaboration or follow-up on the message with the Brazilian Baha'i community. [...] "It is not just a matter of people reading the message. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it into action." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{sentiment}} {{was nothing}} new {{for a man who}} logged more ice time per game (30:37) than any other player in the league last season.
