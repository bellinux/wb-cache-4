40|$|The use of {{a speech}} {{recognition}} system with <b>telephone</b> channel <b>environments,</b> or different microphones, requires channel equalisation. In speech recognition, the speech model provides a bank of statistical {{information that can be}} used in the channel identification and equalisation process. The authors consider HMM-based channel equalisation, and present results demonstrating that substantial improvement can be obtained through the equalisation process. An alternative method, for speech recognition, is to use a feature set which is more robust to channel distortion. Channel distortions result in an amplitude tilt of the speech cepstrum, and therefore differential cepstral features provide a measure of immunity to channel distortions. In particular the cepstral-time feature matrix, in addition to providing a framework for representing speech dynamics, can be made robust to channel distortions. The authors present results demonstrating that a major advantage of cepstral-time matrices is their channel insensitive characte...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-In {{order to}} reduce the circuit {{complexity}} associated with the estimation of echoes coming from systems with a long impulse response, we consider an estimator which is based on prefiltered input data. We propose a design of this prefilter which is optimal for a given system environment. In doing so, we represent the unknown discrete-time system by a set of characteristic impulse responses, which adequately describe the variety of the system. For such an environment we determine the optimum poles of a recursive prefilter. These poles are assumed to befied during the on-line LMS estimation process, which estimates the unknown echo by linearly weighting the prefilter states. An echo canceler for a typical European <b>telephone</b> subscriber-loop <b>environment</b> is used as a practical example. For this example the prefilter is optimized and realized with an orthogonal-state (lattice) filter. This not only reduces the computational costs-if compared to a conventional FIR filter design-but also permits a substantial speed-up of the on-line LMS adaptation process. I I...|$|R

METHODS: Sixty elderly patients were separated into two groups: the Case Group, composed of 30 individuals, 21 females and nine males, all 60 years old or older and presenting diagnoses of sensorineural hearing loss, and the Control Group, composed of 30 elderly individuals matched to the experimental group by age and gender, presenting normal hearing. The patients underwent anamnesis and pure tone audiometry in frequencies of 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 6000 Hz. Blood samples were collected from each patient for analysis of mutations in nuclear and mitochondrial genes related to non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. RESULTS: It was observed a greater tendency to noise exposure and consumption of alcohol in the Case Group. The statistically significant symptoms between the groups were tinnitus and hearing difficulty in several situations as: silent <b>environment,</b> <b>telephone,</b> television, sound location and in church.

Families from the Gemini cohort (n = 1096) completed a <b>telephone</b> interview (Home <b>Environment</b> Interview; HEI) when their children were 4 years old. Diet, physical activity, and TV viewing were reported at interview. Child height and weight measurements were taken by the parents (using standard scales and height charts) and reported at interview.

These were categorized into 'obesogenic risk' tertiles. Children in 'higher-risk' food environments consumed less fruit (OR; 95 % CI = 0. 39; 0. 27 - 0. 57) and vegetables (0. 47; 0. 34 - 0. 64), and more energy-dense snacks (3. 48; 2. 16 - 5. 62) and sweetened drinks (3. 49; 2. 10 - 5. 81) than children in 'lower-risk' food environments.
