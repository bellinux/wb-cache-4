40|$|The final thesis {{includes}} a review and {{investigation of the}} criteria of <b>tapered</b> <b>bearing</b> wear and seeks to determine the interdependencies of the wear. Factors affecting the intensity of wear are rotational speed, different lubricating oils and greases.

40|$|Permanent magnet {{bearings}} may be conveniently {{employed in}} several mechanical applications when friction and wear {{have to be}} avoided. The mechanical behaviour of these components {{is defined by the}} force acting between the elements of the bearing and by the stiffness of the system. In order to get the desired performance of the bearing a compromise of force and stiffness can be achieved, e. g. by selecting the magnetisation direction of the elements. The paper reviews some general criteria for permanent magnet bearing design and proposes a method for evaluating the most suitable magnetisation direction, based on the equivalent current method and employing Finite Element analyses. Three sample cases of annular and <b>tapered</b> <b>bearing</b> are reported, for which design maps for axial and radial bearings are also presented...|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{practical}} applications of rolling cones {{is the use of}} <b>tapered</b> roller <b>bearings</b> in rotating devices. <b>Tapered</b> <b>bearings</b> can bear higher loads than ball bearings in both radial and axial directions, and therefore are more frequently used as wheel bearings in most wheeled land vehicles.|$|R

50|$|<b>Tapered</b> roller <b>{{bearings}}</b> use conical rollers {{that run}} on conical races. Most roller bearings only take radial or axial loads, but <b>tapered</b> roller <b>bearings</b> support both radial and axial loads, and generally can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. <b>Tapered</b> roller <b>bearings</b> are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, <b>tapered</b> roller <b>bearings</b> are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy loads the tapered roller is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the roller in the bearing adds to bearing friction compared to ball bearings.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this program}} {{is to improve the}} oil-off {{survivability}} of a tapered roller bearing when applied to a helicopter transmission, since the <b>tapered</b> <b>bearing</b> has shown a performance advantage in this application. However, the critical roller end-rib conjunction is vulnerable to damage in an oil-off condition. Three powdered metal materials were selected to use as the rib material for oil-off evaluation. These were: M 2 steel to a 65 % density, CBS 1000 M 65 % density, and CBS 1000 M 75 % density. The bearing styles tested were ribbed cone (inner race) and ribbed cup (outer race). Carburized solid CBS 600 was also used as a ribbed material for comparison of oil-off results. The tests were conducted at six speeds from 4000 rpm (0. 26 million DN) through 37000 rpm (2. 4 million DN). The ribbed cup style bearing achieved longer lives than the ribbed cone style. A standard bearing lasted only 10 minutes at 4000 rpm; however, the 30 -min oil-off goal was achieved through 11000 rpm using the survivable ribbed cup bearing. The oil-off lives at 37000 rpm were less than 10 seconds. The grinding of the powder metal materials and surface preparation to achieve an open porosity is extremely critical to the oil-off performance of the powder metal component...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} experiments per-formed towards diagnosis of localized defects in <b>tapered</b> roller <b>bearings,</b> using High Frequency Resonance Technique (HFRT). A special {{feature of the}} work is that instead of using analog filter and envelope detector for HFRT, digital filtering and envelope detection were used. To practically test this technique, an experimental setup was designed and fabricated for testing various <b>tapered</b> roller <b>bearings</b> to obtain their vibration characteristics. For the purpose of testing, a few defect-free and defective <b>tapered</b> roller <b>bearings</b> were tested using the fabricated set up-the defective bearings tested included bearings with outer race defects, roller defects and combination of both. Based on the above experiments {{it has been shown that}} HFRT is an objective technique and thus useful to diagnose point defects in <b>tapered</b> roller <b>bearings.</b> In addition, due its digital implementation, the HFRT demonstrated in this paper is cheaper than its analog counterpart...|$|R

40|$|A {{diagnostic}} tool {{was developed for}} detecting fatigue damage of <b>tapered</b> roller <b>bearings.</b> <b>Tapered</b> roller <b>bearings</b> are used in helicopter transmissions and have potential for use in high bypass advanced gas turbine aircraft engines. A {{diagnostic tool}} was developed and evaluated experimentally by collecting oil debris data from failure progression tests conducted using health monitoring hardware. Failure progression tests were performed with <b>tapered</b> roller <b>bearings</b> under simulated engine load conditions. Tests were performed on one healthy bearing and three pre-damaged bearings. During each test, data from an on-line, in-line, inductance type oil debris sensor and three accelerometers were monitored and recorded for the occurrence of bearing failure. The bearing was removed and inspected periodically for damage progression throughout testing. Using data fusion techniques, two different monitoring technologies, oil debris analysis and vibration, were integrated into a health monitoring system for detecting bearing surface fatigue pitting damage. The data fusion diagnostic tool was evaluated during bearing failure progression tests under simulated engine load conditions. This integrated system showed improved detection of fatigue damage and health assessment of the <b>tapered</b> roller <b>bearings</b> as compared to using individual health monitoring technologies...|$|R
