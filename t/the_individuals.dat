5|$|Earp's {{anger at}} Holliday's ethnic slur may {{indicate}} that his feelings for Josephine were more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling because {{at that time in}} the 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus in Tombstone was not public knowledge. Otero could know these things only if he had a relationship with someone who had personal knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> involved.|$|E
50|$|One final {{thing to}} {{remember}} about all emotions that can be created through the identity control theory is the degree of closeness those evaluating the identity are to <b>the</b> <b>individual.</b> If <b>the</b> people around <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> {{are very close to}} <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> and they assure their identity, <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> will most likely experience extreme positive emotions. However, if they criticize <b>the</b> identity, <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> will experience extreme negative emotions. The opposite of this, meaning that those evaluating the identity are not extremely close to <b>the</b> <b>individual,</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual's</b> emotions will not become very extreme at all. This is because the opinions of the people close to an individual hold more weight in <b>the</b> <b>individual's</b> mind than <b>the</b> opinions of the people they are not close to.|$|R

2500|$|Critics {{have argued}} that {{forgiveness}} interventions may actually cause an increase in negative affect because {{it is trying to}} inhibit <b>the</b> <b>individual's</b> own personal [...] feelings towards the offender. This can result in <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> feeling negatively towards themselves. This approach is categorizing <b>the</b> <b>individual's</b> feelings by implying that the negative emotions <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> is feeling are unacceptable and feelings of forgiveness is the correct and acceptable way to feel. It might inadvertently promote feelings of shame and contrition within <b>the</b> <b>individual.</b>|$|R

5|$|After {{locating}} the M. schnecki nest, the wasp enters only the nests that contain P. rebeli caterpillars. It {{is able to}} enter the nest without being swarmed because it releases a chemical that causes the worker ants to attack one another instead of concentrating all their efforts on the wasp. Once the wasp reaches the caterpillars, it marks <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> most likely to survive by ovipositing in them. Once the wasp's eggs hatch from the caterpillar's body, the newborn offspring feast on the caterpillar's carcass.|$|E
5|$|By 1893 {{there were}} more than 75 collieries within the Rhondda Valleys and {{although}} most were initially owned by a small group of private individuals this trend changed towards the start of the 20th century as companies began buying up the existing collieries. The widespread adoption of limited liability status began a trend towards a concentration of ownership, reducing some of the economic risks involved in coalmining: unstable coal prices, inflated acquisitions, geological difficulties, and large scale accidents. The emerging companies were formed by <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> and families who sank the original collieries; but by the start of the 20th century, they were no more than principal shareholders. These companies included the Davies's Ocean Coal Company, Archibald Hood's Glamorgan Coal Company and David Davis & Son.|$|E

5|$|Commercial 'dolphin encounter' {{enterprises}} and tours operate in many countries.

In addition to such endeavors, <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> swim with and surface near surfers at the beach. Bottlenose dolphins perform in many aquaria, generating controversy. Animal welfare activists and certain scientists have claimed that the dolphins do not have adequate space or receive adequate care or stimulation. However, others, notably SeaWorld (backed by different scientists), counter that the dolphins are properly cared for, have lots of environmental stimulation and enjoy interacting with humans.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Amuro and the {{children}} start marching and playing their instruments through downtown Los Angeles. <b>The</b> <b>individuals</b> walking in Los Angeles stop for a moment, and look towards the sky, which is cut off screen.

The final chorus has Amuro {{and the children}} dancing and singing at Pershing Square, surrounding by several lighting effects and rainbow-coloured clouds. Several scenes of the clouds start to float within the city, above and near skyscrapers, and the video ends with Amuro, the children, and the citizens smiling.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{counter-terrorism}} agency NCTb {{said that}} it had started a probe into where the suspect originated. Dutch officials also said that they will now use 3D full-body scanning X-ray technology on flights departing to the U.S., despite protests from privacy advocates. Dutch officials said that security must take priority over the privacy of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> being scanned, but the scanners are not designed to compromise an individual's privacy, as the imagery resolution is only high enough to detect non-metallic objects under clothing, such as powdered explosives. Members of the Second Chamber (Lower House) of the Dutch parliament demanded an explanation from Minister of Justice Hirsch Ballin, asking how the suspect managed to smuggle explosives on board, despite Schiphol's reportedly strict security measures.|$|E

50|$|Input vs Output: When an individual's {{identity}} is not received by others as <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> intended, then <b>the</b> possibility for negative emotions increases. Often those around <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> place a different meaning on the identity than the person intended there to be. This causes great frustration for <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> and can {{often lead to}} anger as well. Another part of this discrepancy is if those around <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> completely ignore <b>the</b> identity <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> is hoping to display.
