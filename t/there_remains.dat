5|$|In 2015, Wolf {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} not seek a fourth term by running for re-election in 2016. He was succeeded by Julian Cyr (D-Truro). <b>There</b> <b>remains</b> speculation as to whether he will return to focusing on work as owner and pilot for his airline company, although he is considered a potential candidate for Governor in 2018.|$|E

5|$|The {{decline in}} {{industry}} in the 20th century saw the population fall to pre-industrial levels. Though today an urban suburb, there are no large commercial areas and the new Tesco store is the largest employer. <b>There</b> <b>remains</b> large areas of green space, however, {{and it is a}} popular and high-demand place to live. Residents compare favourably with others in the borough in terms of income, employment levels and educational qualifications.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>remains</b> a small {{degree of}} mystery {{concerning}} Caroline's early life. One account states {{that her father}}, Jules Delacroix, was a janitor of the French Legation at Bucharest. Another states that her father lived in Bucharest to seek his fortune, and she was born there as the thirteenth child of her parents. In her youth, Caroline worked as a barmaid.|$|E

5|$|A {{second type}} are the intraductal {{papillary}} mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). These are macroscopic lesions, which {{are found in}} about 2% of all adults. This rate rises to ~10% by age 70. These lesions have about a 25% risk of developing into invasive cancer. They may have KRAS gene mutations (~40–65% of cases) and in the GNAS Gs alpha subunit and RNF43, affecting the Wnt signaling pathway. Even if removed surgically, <b>there</b> <b>remains</b> a considerably increased risk of pancreatic cancer developing subsequently.|$|E
5|$|At an {{estimated}} , IK Pegasi B {{is considered to}} be a high-mass white dwarf. Although its radius has not been observed directly, it can be estimated from known theoretical relationships between the mass and radius of white dwarfs, giving a value of about 0.60% of the Sun's radius. (A different source gives a value of 0.72%, so <b>there</b> <b>remains</b> some uncertainty in this result.) Thus this star packs a mass greater than the Sun into a volume roughly the size of the Earth, giving an indication of this object's extreme density.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, most of Mayfair {{was built}} on with prestigious housing to suit the upper class; unlike some nearby areas of London, it has never lost its {{affluent}} status. The decline of the British aristocracy in the early 20th century led to Mayfair becoming more commercial instead of residential, with many former homes converted into offices for major corporate headquarters, embassies and other businesses. <b>There</b> <b>remains</b> a substantial quantity of luxury residential property, upmarket shops and restaurants, and modern hotels along Piccadilly and Park Lane in particular. Mayfair's prestigious status has been commemorated by being the most expensive property square on the London Monopoly board.|$|E

In addition <b>there</b> are <b>remains</b> of several Arctic expeditions, {{for instance in}} Virgohamna, Danes Island, the launching point for Swedish engineer S. A. Andrée's failed 1897 attempt to reach the North Pole in a hydrogen balloon. The park was established by royal resolution on 1 June 1973.|$|R
5|$|Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Kea {{has been}} created as the Pacific tectonic plate has moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's {{underlying}} mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the -long Hawaiian Ridge–Emperor seamount chain. The prevailing, though not completely settled, {{view is that the}} hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, if not all of the Cenozoic Era. However, while Hawaiian volcanism is well understood and extensively studied, <b>there</b> <b>remains</b> no definite explanation of the mechanism that causes the hotspot effect.|$|E
5|$|Remains {{similar to}} the American white ibis {{have been found in}} Middle Pliocene {{deposits}} of the Bone Valley formation in central Florida, and Lower Pliocene deposits of the Yorktown Formation at Lee Creek in North Carolina. Two species, one living and one extinct, have been recovered from the Talara Tar Seeps in northern coastal Peru. Eudocimus peruvianus was described from a tarsometatarsus that differed slightly from E.albus, whose remains were also found <b>there.</b> <b>Remains</b> of neither species are common in the beds. The tar seeps have been dated at 13,900 years old. The American white ibis is still found in Peru.|$|E
5|$|The Mar Saba {{letter was}} {{attributed}} to Clement by Morton Smith, but <b>there</b> <b>remains</b> much debate today over whether it is an authentic letter from Clement, an ancient pseudepigraph or a modern forgery. If authentic, its main significance would be in its relating that the Apostle Mark came to Alexandria from Rome and there wrote a more spiritual Gospel, which he entrusted to the Church in Alexandria on his death; if genuine, the letter pushes back the tradition related by Eusebius connecting Mark with Alexandria by a century.|$|E

5|$|The {{founding}} educational {{philosophy is}} still {{evident in the}} modern day curriculum in the focus on learning by doing, teaching based on broad themes that cross subjects, an emphasis on collaborative projects, and a de-emphasis of textbooks. <b>There</b> <b>remains</b> a close integration of art and nature in daily activities and {{a focus on the}} development of social skills and education for social responsibility. These principles, adapted in the 1970s for gifted students, have been further extended to accommodate new developments in technology and educational research.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>remains</b> some {{uncertainty}} {{whether the}} source test or nature test {{ought to be}} the determining test. It appears, though, that the impact of Datafin remains qualified in the light of other decisions where the source of the power was held to be the determining factor. It is also worth noting that the effect of the nature test is greatly restricted in practice due to the insistence on the difference between contractual and governmental powers. Where there is a contractual relationship between an aggrieved person and the body making a decision affecting the person, this tends to place the dispute on the private law side of the public–private divide, making the decision not amenable to judicial review.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} on 28 April or 29 April, General Gotthard Heinrici, Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula, was {{relieved}} of his command after disobeying Hitler's direct orders to hold Berlin {{at all costs}} and never order a retreat, {{and was replaced by}} General Kurt Student. General Kurt von Tippelskirch was named as Heinrici's interim replacement until Student could arrive and assume control. <b>There</b> <b>remains</b> some confusion as to who was in command, as some references say that Student was captured by the British and never arrived. Regardless of whether von Tippelskirch or Student was in command of Army Group Vistula, the rapidly deteriorating situation that the Germans faced meant that Army Group Vistula coordination of the armies under its nominal command during the last few days of the war was of little significance.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1958, {{outer space}} {{has been the}} subject of {{multiple}} resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Still, <b>there</b> <b>remains</b> no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and anti-satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 Moon Treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.|$|E
5|$|For example, (using {{the first}} formula (1) for {{absolute}} maximum breathing time), a diver {{at a depth}} of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020kg/m³ (typical seawater), who breathes at a rate of 20 litres per minute, using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars, can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before the cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation. In some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly, from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath, a breath which may not be fully drawn. (There is never any difficulty exhaling). The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder. In such circumstances <b>there</b> <b>remains</b> air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe it. Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy compensator devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, an overdensity {{of stars}} in the region was {{announced}} to be the Canis Major Dwarf, the closest satellite galaxy to Earth. However, <b>there</b> <b>remains</b> debate over whether it represents a disrupted dwarf galaxy or in fact {{a variation in the}} thin and thick disk and spiral arm populations of the Milky Way. Investigation of the area yielded only ten RR Lyrae variables—consistent with the Milky Way's halo and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy. On the other hand, a globular cluster in Puppis, NGC 2298—which appears {{to be part of the}} Canis Major dwarf system—is extremely metal-poor, suggesting it did not arise from the Milky Way's thick disk, and instead is of extragalactic origin.|$|E
