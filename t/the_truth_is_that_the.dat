He then took refuge at the altar in the orchestra of the Theater of Dionysus. At his trial, he pleaded ignorance. He was acquitted, with the jury sympathetic to the military service of Aeschylus and his brothers during the Persian Wars. According to the 2nd-century AD author Aelian, Aeschylus's younger brother Ameinias helped to acquit Aeschylus by showing the jury the stump of the hand that he lost at Salamis, where he was voted bravest warrior. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> award for bravery at Salamis went not to Aeschylus' brother but to Ameinias of Pallene.|$|E

500|$|An {{anonymous}} humorous piece {{appeared in}} Joseph Addison's Spectator in 1714 purporting {{to explain the}} rarity of the flitch being awarded {{in terms of the}} poor quality of the applicants. [...] The writer claims that the source is the Register of Whichenovre-hall but <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> piece is almost certainly entirely fictitious. [...] The first couple to claim, according to this account, were at first successful, but then had the flitch taken away from them after they began to argue about how it should be dressed. [...] Another couple failed when the husband, who had only reluctantly attended, had his ears boxed by his wife during the questioning. [...] A couple who applied after only their honeymoon had finished passed the questioning but since insufficient time had elapsed were awarded just one rasher. [...] One of only two couples to be successful in the first century of the tradition was a ship's captain and his wife who had not actually seen one another for over a year since their marriage.|$|E

2500|$|Another US historian, David Healy, refuted this, and Fredrick B. Pike {{calls this}} {{allegation}} [...] "absurd": The economic development that accompanied {{and followed the}} War of the Pacific was so remarkable that Marxist writers feel justified in alleging that Chile's great military adventure was instigated by self-seeking capitalists {{in order to bring}} their country out of the business stagnation that had begun in 1878. However absurd this allegation, <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> war did provide Chile with the economic means for coming of age. Sater states that this interpretation overlooks certain important facts. The Chilean investors in Bolivia feared that Daza, the Bolivian dictator, would use, as he did, the war as an excuse to expropriate his investments. Among them were Melchor de Concha y Toro, the politically powerful president of Chile's Camara de Diputados, , and Lorenzo Claro, a Chilean founder of the Banco de Bolivia and a prominent member of the National Party (Chile, 1857–1933). A Santiago newspaper claimed that Melchor de Concha y Toro offered president Pinto $2,000,000 to end the dispute and return to the 1874 boundary line. [...] "In other words", writes W. Sater, [...] "there were as many powerful interests opposed to helping the Compañía de Salitres as there were those seeking to aid the corporation" [...] Also, B. Farcau objects to the argument: [...] "On the other hand, the sorry state of the Chilean armed forces at the outbreak of the war, as will be discussed in the following chapter, hardly supports a theory of conscious, premeditated aggression".|$|E
