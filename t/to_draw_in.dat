5|$|Anna Popplewell plays Chyler Silva, a cadet who, {{contrary}} to Lasky's beliefs, {{is a full}} supporter of {{the war against the}} insurrectionists. Popplewell portrays Silva as a competent cadet who has been hardened by her childhood surrounded by insurrectionist violence. She had a romantic connection with Lasky that was interrupted by the Covenant attack. Popplewell was new to the Halo series when cast for the role but thinks that the characters and aesthetic of the series have the potential <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>in</b> a new audience.|$|E
5|$|Gaara {{was created}} a foil to the series' eponymous character, Naruto Uzumaki, {{as the two}} were born through similar circumstances, but develop vastly {{different}} personalities due to a troubled upbringing. His designs and name underwent {{major changes in the}} making of his final one which also was modified in later arcs to give Gaara a design that is easier <b>to</b> <b>draw.</b> <b>In</b> the Japanese version of the series, Gaara is voiced by Akira Ishida while Liam O'Brien replaces him in the English dub.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to attracting predators {{such as the}} Amazon river dolphin, these high-water occurrences are an ideal location <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>in</b> the local fisheries. Human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species, the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and the pirapitinga (Piaractus brachypomus), resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the Amazon river dolphin. The local fishermen overfish, and when the Amazon River dolphins remove the commercialized fish from the nets and lines, it damages the equipment and the capture and causes a negative reaction from the local fishermen.|$|E

When they find it, Fang reveals the reason she left Vanille: In order to prevent the ritual in Luxerion, as the clavis has the power <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>in</b> the souls of the dead, killing Vanille in the process. Fang attempts to destroy the relic, but the forces of the Order arrive and take the clavis, with Fang following in pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by the prosecution and unchallenged by Jackson. Jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media. The media bias {{was evident in the}} use of sensational headlines <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>in</b> readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, the purchasing of stories of his alleged criminal activity, the purchasing of confidential leaked material from the police investigation, deliberately using pictures of his appearance at its worst, using headlines that strongly implied his guilt, and a general lack of objectivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{objectives}} of the assault were to inflict casualties and to draw German troops away from the 3rd Battle of Ypres, rather than to capture territory. The Canadian Corps executed an operation to capture Hill 70 and then establish defensive positions from which combined small-arms and artillery fire, some of which used the new technique of predicted fire, would repel German counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible. The goals of the Canadian Corps were only partially accomplished; the Germans were prevented from transferring local divisions to the Ypres Salient but failed <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>in</b> troops from other areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{rudiments of}} {{perspective}} arrived with Giotto (1266/7 – 1337), who attempted <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>in</b> perspective using an algebraic method {{to determine the}} placement of distant lines. In 1415, the Italian architect Filippo Brunelleschi and his friend Leon Battista Alberti demonstrated the geometrical method of applying perspective in Florence, using similar triangles as formulated by Euclid, to find the apparent height of distant objects. Brunelleschi's own perspective paintings are lost, but Masaccio's painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work.|$|E
5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>in</b> the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E
5|$|The young William showed artistic promise from {{an early}} age, drawing in chalk on the wooden floor of his father's shop. From the age of four he {{attended}} local schools in York, before being sent {{at the age of}} 10 to Mr. Hall's Academy, a boarding school in nearby Pocklington, which he left two years later. On 8October 1798, at the age of 11, William was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Peck of Hull, publisher of the Hull Packet. While Etty found the work exhausting and unpleasant, he continued <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>in</b> his spare time, and his job gave him the opportunity to broaden his education by reading books. It seems likely that it was working as a printer that led him to realise {{for the first time that}} it was possible for someone to make a living drawing and painting.|$|E

Therefore, if Russia were <b>drawn</b> <b>in</b> Group B, Ukraine had <b>to</b> be <b>drawn</b> <b>in</b> Group C or D, and if Russia were <b>drawn</b> <b>in</b> Group C or D, Ukraine had <b>to</b> be <b>drawn</b> <b>in</b> Group A or B.|$|R

5|$|Before the {{development}} of Final Fantasy X, game scenario writer Kazushige Nojima {{was concerned about the}} relationship between the player and the main character in a Final Fantasy title and wanted {{to try to make the}} story easier to follow. Since the player and the main character find themselves in a new world, Nojima wanted Tidus' understanding of that world to track the player's progress in the game. Nojima felt that Tidus was the easiest character <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>in</b> the first half of Final Fantasy X, because character and player learn about the storyline together. Nojima created a brief description of Tidus for character designer Tetsuya Nomura, and Nomura created a sketch for input from Nojima and other staff members. Nomura was asked to design Tidus differently from the game's theme so he would stand out. Movie director Hiroshi Kuwabara noted the difficulty the developers had in making Tidus and the other main characters realistic. The staff wanted to use an undead person as a playable character, and Tidus was meant to be that character. During Final Fantasy X development, however, Nojima saw a film with a similar idea for its protagonist. The role of an undead person was then given to a secondary character, Auron.|$|E
5|$|Dragonfly nymphs vary in {{form with}} species and are loosely classed into claspers, sprawlers, hiders, and burrowers. The first instar {{is known as}} a prolarva, a {{relatively}} inactive stage from which it quickly moults into the more active nymphal form. The general body plan {{is similar to that of}} an adult, but the nymph lacks wings and reproductive organs. The lower jaw has a huge, extensible labium, armed with hooks and spines, which is used for catching prey. This labium is folded under the body at rest and struck out at great speed by hydraulic pressure created by the abdominal muscles. Whereas damselfly nymphs have three feathery external gills, dragonfly nymphs have internal gills, located around the fourth and fifth abdominal segments. Water is pumped in and out of the abdomen through an opening at the tip. The naiads of some clubtails (Gomphidae) that burrow into the sediment, have a snorkel-like tube at the end of the abdomen enabling them <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>in</b> clean water while they are buried in mud. Naiads can forcefully expel a jet of water to propel themselves with great rapidity.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form along linear {{bands of}} temperature/dewpoint gradient with significant vertical wind shear, {{and are thus}} classified as baroclinic cyclones. Initially, cyclogenesis, or low pressure formation, occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the upper level jetstream known as a jet streak. The favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants, where divergence ensues. The divergence causes air to rush out {{from the top of}} the air column. As mass in the column is reduced, atmospheric pressure at surface level (the weight of the air column) is reduced. The lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone (a low pressure system). The lowered pressure acts <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>in</b> air, creating convergence in the low-level wind field. Low-level convergence and upper-level divergence imply upward motion within the column, making cyclones tend to be cloudy. As the cyclone strengthens, the cold front sweeps towards the equator and moves around the back of the cyclone. Meanwhile, its associated warm front progresses more slowly, as the cooler air ahead of the system is denser, and therefore more difficult to dislodge. Later, the cyclones occlude as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the warm front, forcing a tongue, or trowal, of warm air aloft. Eventually, the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken.|$|E
