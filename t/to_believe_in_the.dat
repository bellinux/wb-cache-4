5|$|Lloyd George agreed {{it might}} be {{acceptable}} to the British electorate. However, America was against the plan; the US was then the largest creditor, and by this time Wilson had started <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> merits of a harsh peace and thought that his country had already made excessive sacrifices. Hence despite his best efforts, {{the end result of}} the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds, and led to his resignation from the Treasury.|$|E
5|$|Between 1871 and 1874, {{while he}} lectured at the Conservatory, Rimsky-Korsakov {{thoroughly}} grounded himself in Western compositional techniques, and came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> value of academic training for {{success as a}} composer. Once Rimsky-Korsakov had made this turn-around, Tchaikovsky considered him an esteemed colleague, and, if not the best of friends, was at least on friendly terms with him. When {{the other members of}} The Five became hostile toward Rimsky-Korsakov for his change of attitude, Tchaikovsky continued to support Rimsky-Korsakov morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing, and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. Beginning in 1876, Tchaikovsky was a regular visitor to the Rimsky-Korsakov home during his trips to Saint Petersburg. At one point, Tchaikovsky offered to have Rimsky-Korsakov appointed to the directorship of the Moscow Conservatory, but he refused.|$|E

Reyes goes to visit Jeb's sister, Katha, and learns {{he did not know}} Bob Harvey. While Reyes is there, Katha receives a call from Jeb, but tells him to call later. As Jeb leaves the phone booth, he kills a female motorist. Meanwhile, Doggett learns from Scully that she has suffered a placental abruption.

She says she realized she was “afraid to believe.” Scully later tells Mulder to keep trying to help Doggett.|$|E
5|$|Roman Academic Cotta ridicules both {{literal and}} allegorical {{acceptance}} of myth, declaring roundly that myths {{have no place}} in philosophy. Cicero is also generally disdainful of myth, but, like Varro, he is emphatic in his support for the state religion and its institutions. It is difficult to know how far down the social scale this rationalism extended. Cicero asserts that no one (not even old women and boys) is so foolish as <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> terrors of Hades or the existence of Scyllas, centaurs or other composite creatures, but, on the other hand, the orator elsewhere complains of the superstitious and credulous character of the people. De Natura Deorum is the most comprehensive summary of Cicero's line of thought.|$|E

Artefacts (special objects that glow in their owner's colour) and missionary disciples {{can be used to}} impress villagers. Villagers become bored with repetitive attempts to impress them. For example, if boulders fly overhead too frequently, their effect is lost. This forces the player to use multiple methods to convert a village.|$|E

5|$|The {{roots of}} the {{collapse}} of the monarchy can be traced as far back as 1850, upon the death of Pedro II's youngest male child. From that point onward, the Emperor ceased <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> monarchy as a viable form of government for Brazil's future, as his remaining heir was a daughter. Although constitutionally permitted, a female ruler was considered unacceptable by both Pedro II and the ruling circles. This issue was deferred for decades, during which the country became more powerful and prosperous. So long as the Emperor enjoyed good health, the matter of succession could be ignored.|$|E

25|$|The {{basis for}} Spencer's appeal {{to many of}} his {{generation}} was that he appeared to offer a ready-made system of belief which could substitute for conventional religious faith {{at a time when}} orthodox creeds were crumbling under the advances of modern science.

25|$|The {{process of}} {{preserving}} and maintaining one's health throughout {{life is a}} matter of grave concern. At some point in every person's life, his or her health is going to decline regardless of all measures taken to prevent such a collapse.

25|$|The term had {{a lasting}} {{influence}} {{as by the}} end of the 18th century it had become a popular term of abuse used by conservative journals to refer to supporters of the Revolution. These journals accused those who practiced philosophism as having no principles or respect for authority. They were skeptics who failed <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> monarchy and the church and thus, had no principles. The use of the term became pervasive in the Anti-Jacobin Review and contributed to the belief in a connection between the Enlightenment and the Revolution and its supporters. Philosophism became a powerful tool of anti-revolutionary and anti-Jacobin rhetoric.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the notion}} of Satya, or Truth, {{is central to the}} Gandhian {{conception}} of nonviolence. Gandhi saw Truth as something that is multifaceted and unable to be grasped in its entirety by any one individual. All carry pieces of the Truth, he believed, but all need the pieces of others’ truths in order to pursue the greater Truth. This led him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inherent worth of dialogue with opponents, in order to understand motivations. On a practical level, the willingness to listen to another's point of view is largely dependent on reciprocity. In order to be heard by one's opponents, one must also be prepared to listen.|$|E

Furthermore, Carrier argues that the Jesus figure was probably originally known only through private revelations and hidden messages in scripture which were then crafted into a historical figure to communicate {{the claims of the}} gospels allegorically. These allegories then started to be believed as fact during the struggle for control of the Christian churches of the first century. He argues that the probability of Jesus' existence is somewhere in the range from 1/3 to 1/12000 depending on the estimates used for the computation.|$|E

Much like Evangelical Christianity, the Cylon religion encourages {{a personal relationship with}} God. Despite being man-made, Cylons believe that they were created by God. The different Cylon models have varying degrees of faith; at least one, Cavil, does not subscribe to any religion.

25|$|Type II Seyfert galaxies {{have the}} {{characteristic}} bright core, {{as well as}} appearing bright when viewed at infrared wavelengths. Their spectra contain narrow lines associated with forbidden transitions, and broad lines associated with allowed strong dipole or intercombination transitions. In some Typenbsp&II Seyfert galaxies, analysis with a technique called spectro-polarimetry (spectroscopy of polarised light component) revealed obscured typenbsp&I regions. In the case of NGC 1068, nuclear light reflected off a dust cloud was measured, which led scientists <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of an obscuring dust torus around a bright continuum and broad emission line nucleus. When the galaxy is viewed from the side, the nucleus is indirectly observed through reflection by gas and dust {{above and below the}} torus. This reflection causes the polarisation.|$|E
