5|$|In {{some parts}} of the world (mainly Africa and South America), large ants, {{especially}} army ants, are used as surgical sutures. <b>The</b> <b>wound</b> is pressed together and ants are applied along it.

The body is then cut off and the head and mandibles remain in place to close <b>the</b> <b>wound.</b> The large heads of the dinergates (soldiers) of the leafcutting ant Atta cephalotes are also used by native surgeons in closing wounds.|$|E
