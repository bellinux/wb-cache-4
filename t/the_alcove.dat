For the next , NY143 runs along {{the eastern edge of the}} reservoir, passing by little more than dense forests. The route breaks from the shoreline at the hamlet of Alcove, which comprises several isolated homes connected by a handful of local streets. Here, NY143 meets the northern terminus of CR111 as it turns to follow Hannacrois Creek eastward along the base of a narrow, winding valley.|$|E

25|$|While {{living at}} the Verona apartments in Detroit's Cass Corridor, Chuck and Joni were regular {{performers}} at area coffee houses, including <b>the</b> <b>Alcove</b> bar, near Wayne State University; the Rathskeller, a restaurant {{on the campus of}} the University of Detroit; and the Raven Gallery in Southfield. She began playing and composing songs in alternative guitar tunings taught to her by a fellow musician, Eric Andersen, in Detroit. Oscar Brand featured her several times on his CBC television program Let's Sing Out in 1965 and 1966, broadening her exposure. The marriage and partnership of Joni and Chuck Mitchell dissolved in early 1967, and Joni moved to New York City to pursue her musical dreams as a solo artist. She played venues up and down the East Coast, including Philadelphia, Boston, and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. She performed frequently in coffeehouses and folk clubs and, by this time creating her own material, became well known for her unique songwriting and her innovative guitar style.|$|E
25|$|By {{winter the}} roof was in place, clad in {{reflective}} aluminum {{to make it look}} more like ice blocks. Larocque set himself to the church's decorative touches. To create the appearance of stained glass in the windows, an old French technique was used. The pattern was drawn and painted on translucent paper, then sandwiched between glass. Larocque created <b>the</b> <b>alcove</b> behind the altar and its crucifix himself. Adam commissioned Mona Sharer, a 17-year-old deaf-mute Inuit woman who had shown talent as an artist at a Catholic school in Aklavik, to paint the Stations of the Cross on the inside walls. She started in January 1960 and completed the work in two months, along with some other paintings of scenes from the life of Christ. Later that year the church was formally consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary by Paul Piché, bishop of the Apostolic Vicariate of Mackenzie (later elevated to the Diocese of Mackenzie-Fort Smith).|$|E
25|$|The kitchen area {{reflects}} {{the original design}} concept; it includes separate stations for baking and pastries and was never reduced when the original project was downsized. High quality kitchen appliances were installed so the hotel could compete with fine dining establishments, and the facility was specifically constructed to handle special events and functions. The wood beames {{in the dining room}} are actually hollow, with steel beams going through them for fire safety reasons. Every detail was carefully thought out. <b>The</b> <b>alcove</b> window {{at the end of the}} room perfectly framed Yosemite Falls when the hotel was completed. The dining room is 130 feet long and 51 feet wide, with a 34-foot ceiling supported with rock columns creating a cathedral like atmosphere. While the dress code for the park is usually very casual, the Ahwahnee Dining Room used to require a jacket for men, but it later relaxed that tradition. Now collared shirts for men are allowed and women may wear either a dress or slacks and a blouse.|$|E

This was a holy site for the Hittites, located {{within walking distance of the}} gates of the city of Hattusa. At first <b>the</b> <b>alcoves</b> were enclosed with a simple wall.

500|$|Although it is {{referred}} to as a [...] "cave", Mummy Cave is actually a broad, shallow alcove in a vertical cliff. It owes its depth to its overall size and the stability of the parent rock. The alcove's roof is about [...] above the river, with the rock floor of <b>the</b> <b>alcove</b> at about [...] above the river. By the time it was discovered, <b>the</b> <b>alcove</b> had been almost entirely filled with alluvium. The cliff is composed of Tertiary period volcanic ash mixed with larger rock fragments of volcanic origin. A similar alcove is being cut by the Shoshone at the mouth of Clocktower Creek. The cave fill has accumulated for at least 10,000years and appears to have originated from nearby debris fans formed where weathered material has flowed down channels in neighboring cliffs.|$|E
500|$|At its mouth, {{the cave}} is {{approximately}} [...] wide, and it extends approximately [...] into a volcanic cliff above the North Fork. It lies along the left {{bank of the}} river, next {{to the mouth of}} a small stream and opposite from the mouth of Blackwater Creek. The largest known cave along the North Fork, it {{is believed to have been}} carved by the river's flow; the reason for its diversion away from <b>the</b> <b>alcove</b> is unknown.|$|E
500|$|The {{investigation}} of Mummy Cave {{was led by}} Robert Edgar from 1963 to 1965. <b>The</b> <b>alcove</b> was marked out into a [...] grid, with a permanent reference mark for elevation marked on the wall. Initial investigation focused on establishing stratigraphy. Once the layers of alluvium in the cave floor were established, the excavation proceeded layer by layer. The excavations terraced the cave floor into [...] levels, following the established reference grid. Digging was done with hand trowels in the artifact-bearing layers while layers devoid of artifacts were excavated with shovels. Spoils were disposed of down the embankment.|$|E
