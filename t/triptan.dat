25|$|Triptans — {{there have}} been rare postmarketing reports of hyperserotonergia (serotonin syndrome). If {{concomitant}} treatment of milnacipran with a <b>triptan</b> is clinically warranted, careful observation of patient is advised when starting or increasing dosages.|$|E
25|$|Abortive therapies for {{migraine}}s may be oral, if the migraine is mild to moderate, or {{may require}} stronger medicine given intravenously or intramuscularly. Mild to moderate headaches should first {{be treated with}} acetaminophen (paracetamol) or NSAIDs, like ibuprofen. If accompanied by nausea or vomiting, an antiemitic such as metoclopramide (Reglan) can be given orally or rectally. Moderate to severe attacks should be treated first with an oral <b>triptan,</b> a medication which mimics serotonin (an agonist) and causes mild vasoconstriction. If accompanied by nausea and vomiting, parenteral (through a needle in the skin) triptans and antiemetics can be given.|$|E
5000|$|A test {{measuring}} a person's skin sensitivity {{during a}} migraine may indicate whether the individual {{will respond to}} treatment with <b>triptans.</b> [...] <b>Triptans</b> are most effective in those with no skin sensitivity; with skin sensitivity, {{it is best to}} take <b>triptans</b> within twenty minutes of the headache's onset.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In most {{migraine}} patients acute {{therapy is}} needed. Migraine {{can be treated}} either with specific drugs, the <b>triptans</b> and ergot alka-loids, or with NSAIDs. <b>Triptans</b> are a major step foreward in migraine therapy. The therapeutic gain for headache relief is 50 % for subcutaneous sumatriptan whereas it is 30 - 40 % for most oral <b>triptans.</b> After oral <b>triptans</b> sustained pain free is only 30 %. There is thus still ample room for improvement of acute therapy in migraine. For ten-sion-type headache there is no spe-cific therapy and it is treated with NSAIDs. Only 17 - 32 % become pain free after these drugs. For attacks of cluster headache oxygen and subcutaneous sumatriptan can be used. Intranasal <b>triptans</b> can be an alternative...|$|R
500|$|Many {{medications}} {{may have}} been incorrectly thought to cause serotonin syndrome. For example, some case reports have implicated atypical antipsychotics in serotonin syndrome, but it appears based on their pharmacology that {{they are unlikely to}} cause the syndrome. [...] It has also been suggested that mirtazapine has no significant serotonergic effects, and is therefore not a dual action drug. Bupropion has also been suggested to cause serotonin syndrome, although as {{there is no evidence that}} it has any significant serotonergic activity, it is thought unlikely to produce the syndrome. In 2006 the United States Food and Drug Administration issued an alert suggesting that the combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and <b>triptan</b> medications or sibutramine could potentially lead to severe cases of serotonin syndrome. This has been disputed by other researchers as none of the cases reported by the FDA met the Hunter criteria for serotonin syndrome. The condition has however occurred in surprising clinical situations, and because of phenotypic variations among individuals, it has been associated with unexpected drugs, including mirtazapine.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{examine the}} {{association}} between the cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and <b>triptans</b> use among adults with migraine. Methods. A retrospective cross-sectional study design was used. Data were derived from 2009 – 2013 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). The study sample consisted of adults (age > 21 years) with migraine headache (N = 1, 652). Multivariable logistic regression {{was used to examine}} the relationship between CV risk factors and <b>triptans</b> use. Results. Overall, 21 % adults with migraine headache used <b>triptans.</b> Nearly two-thirds (61 %) of adults with migraine had at least one CV risk factor. A significantly lower percentage of adults with CV risk (18. 1 %) used <b>triptans</b> compared to those without CV risk factors (25. 5 %). After controlling for demographic, socioeconomic status, access to care, and health status, adults with no CV risk factors were more likely to use <b>triptans</b> as compared to those with one CV risk factor (AOR = 1. 83, 95 % CI = 1. 17 – 2. 87). There were no statistically significant differences in <b>triptans</b> use between those with two or more CV risk factors and those with one CV risk factor. Conclusion. An overwhelming majority of adults with migraine had a contraindication to <b>triptans</b> based on their CV risk factors. The use of <b>triptans</b> among adults with migraine and multiple CV risk factors warrants further investigation...|$|R

40|$|Dose–response curves for {{headaches}} {{relief and}} adverse events (AEs) are presented for five triptans: sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan, almotriptan, and frovatriptan, and the CGRP antagonist telcagepant.

The optimal dose for the <b>triptans</b> is mainly determined by tolerability. Telcagepant has an excellent tolerability and can be used in migraine patients with cardiovascular co-morbidity.

50|$|Donitriptan (INN) (code name F-11356) is a <b>triptan</b> drug {{which was}} {{investigated}} as an antimigraine agent but ultimately was never marketed.

40|$|Abstract: Migraine is {{a common}} {{disabling}} disorder that affects approximately 12 % of the population. Migraine treatment requires the avoidance of triggers, acute treatment to control individual attacks, and preventive treatment for patients with frequent headaches. The choice between the different drugs available for the acute management of migraine {{is based on the}} severity of the attacks and associated symptoms. Migraine-specific acute therapies, such as <b>triptans,</b> are recommended in patients with moderate or severe migraine attacks and also for mild episodes that do not respond to simple analgesics. The use of simple analgesics is appropriate for mild attacks or patients who cannot use <b>triptans.</b> Currently, ergotics are not recommended in de novo migraine patients mainly because of their lower efficacy compared to <b>triptans</b> and their side-effect profile. Novel methods for delivering <b>triptans</b> and ergotics will increase the efficacy and reduce the side effects of current formulations. New acute migraine therapies without vasoconstrictive activity and a better side-effect profile than <b>triptans</b> are under investigation. This review focuses on drugs to treat acute migraine attacks and covers a comprehen-sive selection of emerging therapies...|$|R
40|$|<b>Triptans,</b> {{selective}} 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor agonists, {{are specific}} drugs for the acute treatment of migraine {{that have the}} same mechanism of action. Here, it is discussed why the differences among kinetic parameters of oral <b>triptans</b> have proved not {{to be very important}} in clinical practice. There are three main reasons: (1) the differences among the kinetic parameters of oral <b>triptans</b> are smaller than what appears from their average values; (2) there is a large inter-subject, gender-dependent, and intra-subject (outside/during the attack) variability of kinetic parameters related to the rate and extent of absorption, i. e., those which are considered as critical for the response; (3) no dose-concentration-response curves have been defined and it is, therefore, impossible both to compare the kinetics of <b>triptans,</b> and to verify the objective importance of kinetic differences; (4) the importance of kinetic differences is outweighed by non-kinetic factors of variability of response to <b>triptans.</b> If no oral formulations are found that can allow more predictable pharmacokinetics, the same problems will probably also arise with new classes of drugs for the acute treatment of migraine...|$|R

50|$|The drugs of {{this class}} act as {{agonists}} for serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors at {{blood vessels and}} nerve endings in the brain. The first clinically available <b>triptan</b> was sumatriptan, which has been marketed since 1991.|$|E
50|$|<b>Triptans</b> {{are used}} for the {{treatment}} of severe migraine attacks or those that do not respond to NSAIDs or other over-the-counter drugs. <b>Triptans</b> are a mid-line treatment suitable for many migraineurs with typical attacks.

50|$|Lasmiditan is a {{serotonin}} {{receptor agonist}} that, like the unsuccessful LY-334,370, selectively binds to the 5-HT1F receptor subtype.
