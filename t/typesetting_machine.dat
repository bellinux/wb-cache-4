25|$|The only fully {{electromechanical}} Selectric Typewriter with fully {{proportional spacing}} and which used a Selectric type element was the expensive Selectric Composer, which {{was capable of}} right-margin justification and was considered a <b>typesetting</b> <b>machine</b> rather than a typewriter.|$|E
25|$|Clemens {{invested}} heavily in the <b>typesetting</b> <b>machine</b> invented by James W. Paige. He also formed the firm Charles L. Webster & Company which published his writings, along with Ulysses S. Grant's memoirs. Its first publication was Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in 1884. The company went bankrupt in 1894, leaving Twain with {{a large amount of}} debt; Paige's <b>typesetting</b> <b>machine</b> never functioned properly and was overcome by competition from the linotype machine developed by Whitlaw Reid. The losses from these investments as well as several bank panics led the Clemens family to move to Europe in 1891 where the cost of living was more affordable. He began lecturing across the continent to recoup some money for their family.|$|E
25|$|Twain {{had some}} very bad times with his businesses. His {{publishing}} company ended up going bankrupt, and he lost {{thousands of dollars on}} a <b>typesetting</b> <b>machine</b> that was never finished. He also lost a great deal of revenue on royalties from his books being plagiarized before {{he had a chance to}} publish them himself.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1970s and 1980s, {{linotype}} {{and similar}} [...] "hot metal" [...] <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines</b> were retired {{and replaced with}} phototypesetting equipment and later computerized typesetting and page composition systems.|$|R
50|$|In 1893, the {{newspaper}} introduced {{one of the}} first <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines</b> on the European continent, and in 1894 {{the newspaper}} helped in establishing the Schweizerische Depeschenagentur (SDA), still the countrys leading press agency.|$|R
50|$|In 1932, a {{code for}} the paper tape used to drive Linotype and other <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines</b> was standardized. This allowed use of a tape only five to seven holes wide to drive {{automatic}} typewriters, teleprinters and similar equipment.|$|R
25|$|While Victor Daily Record editor George Kyner {{and four}} {{printers}} {{were in the}} bullpen, Emma Langdon, a Linotype <b>typesetting</b> <b>machine</b> operator married {{to one of the}} imprisoned printers, sneaked into the Daily Record office and barricaded herself inside. She printed the next edition of the paper, and then delivered it to the prisoners in the bullpen,p.209 surprising the guards in the process.|$|E
25|$|To {{transcribe}} foreign {{words as}} well as reducing ambiguity, recent Buginese fonts includes three diacritics that suppress inherent vowel (virama), nasalize vowel (anusvara), and mark glottal end or geminated consonant, depending on the position. These diacritics do not exist in traditional Lontara and are not included into Unicode, but has gained currency among Buginese experts, such as Mr Djirong Basang, who worked with the Monotype Typography project to prepare the Lontara fonts used in the LASERCOMP photo <b>typesetting</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{the book}} Domebook One {{was a direct}} {{spin-off}} of the WEC. Lloyd Kahn, Shelter editor of the WEC, borrowed WEC production equipment for a week in 1970 and produced the first book on building geodesic domes. A year later, in 1971, Kahn again borrowed WEC equipment (an IBM Selectric Composer <b>typesetting</b> <b>machine</b> and a Polaroid MP-5 camera on an easel), and spent {{a month in the}} Santa Barbara Mountains producing Domebook 2, which went on to sell 165,000 copies. With production of DB 2, Kahn and his company Shelter Publications followed Stewart Brand's move to nationwide distribution by Random House.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanical}} equipment {{installed in the}} plant included a thirty-two page Duplex press, fifteen Intertype <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines,</b> a large stereotyping machine and scores of cases of display type." [...] The business office was headed by J. A. Easton, business manager.|$|R
50|$|Crowley was {{considered}} both a kind and proficient boss at Intertype, {{and the company}} enjoyed considerable success during his period of management, selling Intertype <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines</b> to almost every major newspaper that operated in the southern half of Britain during that time.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to its electronic successors, the Magnetic Tape Selectric Composer (MT/SC), the Mag Card Selectric Composer, and the Electronic Selectric Composer, IBM also made electronic typewriters with proportional spacing using the Selectric element that were considered typewriters or word processors instead of <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
25|$|This gallery holds {{machinery}} {{from the}} last of the hot metal typesetting printshops as used in the newspaper industry. The monotype keyboard produces punched 31-level tape for casting on the monotype caster. The keyboard comprises seven QWERTY arrangements (Roman upper and lower case, bold upper and lower case, italic upper and lower case and SMALL CAPITALS). It is operated by compressed air and produces a wide paper tape that contains perforations that when transferred to the caster give full instructions for each character to be cast. The monotype system was widely used in the commercial printing sector. There is a forme (text lines produced on a Linotype <b>typesetting</b> <b>machine)</b> made up into {{the front page of the}} last edition of the Yorkshire Sports, 2 May 1981. The assembled forme is ready to be moulded and cast into a curved printing plate.|$|E
500|$|Tides 5–6ft (1.5–2m) {{above normal}} and storm surge in St. Petersburg damaged or {{destroyed}} all four fishing piers. Many ships and boats of all sizes capsized or were beached, including the trawler Hypnotist, which ejected the crew of seven into the water, {{all of whom were}} rescued. The St. Petersburg Beach Hotel was destroyed, after employees swam through the lobby for safety. At the office of the St. Petersburg Times, then located at Fifth Street and First Avenue South, the loss of electricity resulted in staff working overnight with lanterns. With no power to operate the <b>typesetting</b> <b>machine,</b> the employees connected their linotype machine to a two-cylinder motorcycle to publish the [...] "Motorcycle Extra". Two deaths occurred in St. Petersburg, one from a heart attack during preparations for the storm and the other from a man being crushed by a falling roof.|$|E
2500|$|Twain made a {{substantial}} amount of money through his writing, but he lost a great deal through investments. He invested mostly in new inventions and technology, particularly in the Paige <b>typesetting</b> <b>machine.</b> It was a beautifully engineered mechanical marvel that amazed viewers when it worked, but it was prone to breakdowns. Twain spent $300,000 (equal to $ in inflation-adjusted terms [...] ) on it between 1880 and 1894, but before it could be perfected it was rendered obsolete by the Linotype. He lost the bulk of his book profits, as well as {{a substantial}} portion of his wife's inheritance.|$|E
50|$|In 1963, Compugraphic {{moved to}} Reading and {{commissioned}} Massachusetts-based Wang Laboratories {{to develop the}} Linasec, a computer used to prepare justified punched tape to drive linotype <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines</b> which were widely used in the printing industry, which {{at that time was}} based entirely on hot metal type.|$|R
50|$|The <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines</b> were {{continually}} {{improved in}} the early years of the 20th century, with a typewriter style keyboard for entering the type being introduced in 1906. This arrangement addressed the need to vary the space between words so that all lines were the same length.|$|R
5000|$|A Tally of Types {{is a book}} in {{the field}} of typography, {{authored}} by the type designer Stanley Morison in 1953, showcasing significant typeface designs produced during his tenure at the Lanston Monotype Corporation for their hot metal <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines</b> during the 1920s and 1930s in England.|$|R
2500|$|In September 1911, the Palmers {{announced}} that The Spokesman {{had acquired a}} new press and paper cutter to improve newspaper printing and production. [...] A <b>typesetting</b> <b>machine</b> was added a short time later. [...] In January 1912, the new 1,200 pound linotype machine was installed to further improve the operation. [...] However, on 26 Feb 1912 a fire started in a neighboring hardware store. [...] The fire spread to adjacent buildings, burning down a grocery store, a bakery, a furniture store, and The Spokesman office. [...] Despite {{the fact that the}} loss exceeded their insurance coverage by $4,000, the Palmers were able to keep the newspaper going by using the presses at Redmond’s other newspaper, The Oregon Hub and at The Bulletin in nearby Bend to print The Spokesman while new equipment was ordered.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trend was}} further {{strengthened}} by the desktop publishing revolution starting around 1977 with {{the production of the}} Apple II. Early computer software in particular had no way to allow for ligature substitution (the automatic use of ligatures where appropriate), while most new digital typefaces did not include ligatures. As most of the early PC development was designed for the English language (which already treated ligatures as optional at best) dependence on ligatures did not carry over to digital. Ligature use fell as the number of traditional hand compositors and hot metal <b>typesetting</b> <b>machine</b> operators dropped due to the mass production of the IBM Selectric brand of electric typewriter in 1961. A designer active in the period commented: [...] "some of the world’s greatest typefaces were quickly becoming some of the world’s worst fonts." ...|$|E
60|$|We shall put on 3 more cubs. We {{have one}} school boy and two compositors, now,--and {{we think of}} putting on a type writer, a stenographer, and perhaps a shoemaker, to show that no special gifts or {{training}} are required with this machine. We shall train these beginners two or three months--or until some one of them gets up to 7,000 an hour--then we will show up in New York and run the machine 24 hours a day 7 days in the week, for several months--to prove {{that this is a}} machine which will never get out of order or cause delay, and can stand anything an anvil can stand. You know there is no other <b>typesetting</b> <b>machine</b> that can run two hours on a stretch without causing trouble and delay with its incurable caprices.|$|E
5000|$|For 111 years, {{since its}} foundation, the {{newspaper}} employed the [...] "hot type" [...] method, that is, with Linotype <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines</b> where molten lead and antimony {{were used to}} cast each line of text. In 1978 La Capital shifted to [...] "cold type", using the phototypesetting method.|$|R
50|$|Sulzberger {{broadened the}} Times’ use of {{background}} reporting, pictures, and feature articles, and expanded its sections. He supervised {{the development of}} facsimile transmission for photographs and built the Times radio station, WQXR, into a leading vehicle for news and music. Under Sulzberger the Times began to publish editions in Paris and Los Angeles with remote-control <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Times and Democrat has {{continued}} to publish daily despite hurricanes, snowstorms and a 1972 fire that destroyed The Times and Democrat's entire physical plant. Within five days of that fire, new <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines</b> and other production equipment were flown in. Within 10 days, a new press had arrived, and within 30 days, the pressroom building had been rebuilt around it.|$|R

50|$|William Church (circa 1778 - 1863) was an American {{inventor}} who patented a <b>typesetting</b> <b>machine</b> in 1822, {{generally considered}} the first.|$|E
50|$|While {{some sources}} give Perpetua a release date of 1929 {{based on these}} early uses, Perpetua was not to enter full {{commercial}} sale until 1932. Once on sale, it was sold for Monotype's <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines,</b> which cast metal type {{under the control of}} a keyboard, and also sometimes offered in metal type for hand-setting for the use of larger sizes and smaller printers.|$|R
50|$|Established in 1858 by Hermann Berthold {{and based}} in Berlin, the company {{played a key}} role in the {{introduction}} of major new typefaces and was a successful player in the development of <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines.</b> The production premises were on Wilhelmstrasse No. 1 until 1868, and then on Mehringdamm 43. In 1979 the factory moved to another location between Teltow Canal and Wiesenweg in Lichterfelde.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout Craighead's tenure until {{retirement}} in 1927, he was {{supportive of the}} former Confederacy and the Union reconciling, along with economic and commercial development. As the 19th century was coming to a close, the Register began using six Linotype <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines</b> in 1893, which were used for many decades until the [...] "cold type" [...] age began in 1974. Photographs began appearing in the Register during the 1890s.|$|R
50|$|Munson later {{went to work}} {{perfecting}} a <b>typesetting</b> <b>machine</b> that he had invented, which, being {{operated by}} means of a prepared ribbon of paper, automatically set a column of corrected, justified, and leaded type. He also invented the machines by which the ribbon is prepared, and a telegraph, also operated by the same paper ribbon, which causes an exact facsimile of the ribbon to be automatically produced at a distant point, ready for use in operating a similar <b>typesetting</b> <b>machine.</b> These inventions were based on his “Selecting Device,” which he also patented.|$|E
50|$|While {{living in}} Boston, he {{patented}} the Church <b>Typesetting</b> <b>Machine</b> in England, {{consisting of a}} keyboard on which each key released a piece of type of the corresponding letter stored in channels in a magazine.|$|E
50|$|The only fully {{electromechanical}} Selectric Typewriter with fully {{proportional spacing}} and which used a Selectric type element was the expensive Selectric Composer, which {{was capable of}} right-margin justification and was considered a <b>typesetting</b> <b>machine</b> rather than a typewriter.|$|E
50|$|A hellbox is a {{receptacle}} where {{cast metal}} sorts are thrown after printing. The job of sorting the type from the hellbox {{and putting it}} back into the job case was given to the apprentice, known as a printer's devil. Later, when continuous casting or hot metal <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines</b> such as the Linotype and Monotype became popular, the hellbox was used for storing discarded or broken type that were melted down and recast.|$|R
50|$|Eventually the {{building}} {{would become the}} school of journalism for the University of Iowa and would house the campus <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines</b> and printing presses. It would be from these presses that The Daily Iowan, The Hawkeye, Frivol, Iowa Literary Magazine, The Transit and The Journal of Business would be printed. Close Hall would remain {{the home of the}} school of journalism as well as the university press room until the late 1950s.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} was an industrial facility for the company, which made <b>typesetting</b> <b>machines.</b> The company occupied the building {{until at least}} 1940. In 1954 The Salvation Army acquired the building, and used it {{for a variety of}} purposes, including an Adult Rehabilitation Center, which relocated in 2004. MetroPlains Development of St. Paul, Minnesota bought the building in July 2007, and started converting the building into loft apartments in October of the same year. The $8 million project was completed in 2009.|$|R
