5|$|Flat Creek, a small southeast-flowing stream, {{rises in}} two forks and empties into <b>the</b> <b>Sacramento</b> River {{upstream}} of Spring Creek.

5|$|In early February 1986 {{ten inches}} (254mm) of rain fell on <b>the</b> <b>Sacramento</b> region in 11 days, melting the Sierra Nevada snowpack and causing a huge flood to pour down the American River. The 1986 floods {{were some of}} the most severe {{recorded}} in the 20th century; Placer County was quickly designated a Federal Disaster Area. Rampaging streams and rivers incurred some $7.5 million in damages within the county. The rating for Sacramento's levees, supposedly designed to prevent a 125-year flood, was dropped to a 78-year flood in studies conducted after the 1986 event, which suggested that such weather occurred more frequently than previously believed. The floods tore out levees along <b>the</b> <b>Sacramento</b> and Feather Rivers through <b>the</b> <b>Sacramento</b> Valley, and the city of Sacramento was spared by a close margin. Folsom Lake filled to dangerously high levels with runoff from the North, Middle and South Forks of the American River.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Upper <b>Sacramento</b> River is now largely {{recovered}} from the spill though some species (crayfish and frogs) have not yet come back. The watershed is carefully stewarded by <b>The</b> Upper <b>Sacramento</b> River Exchange. <b>The</b> popular fishery is again healthy. Recent changes to angling regulations have opened <b>the</b> Upper <b>Sacramento</b> River to catch-and-release fishing all year round. Five-pound trout have often been caught right in the city.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Government of <b>Sacramento</b> County {{is defined}} and {{authorized}} under the California Constitution, California law, and the Charter of <b>the</b> County of <b>Sacramento.</b> Much of <b>the</b> Government of California is in practice {{the responsibility of}} county governments such as <b>the</b> Government of <b>Sacramento</b> County, while municipalities such as <b>the</b> city of <b>Sacramento</b> and Folsom provide additional, often non-essential services.|$|R
5|$|Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) and <b>the</b> <b>Sacramento</b> Tree Foundation have partnered {{to provide}} the city of Sacramento shade trees for free. The program allows {{citizens}} to receive trees from four to seven feet tall. They also give them fertilizer, and delivery, all at no cost. They encourage citizens to plant their trees to benefit their home by reducing air conditioning costs. Approximately more than 450,000 shade trees have been planted in <b>the</b> <b>Sacramento</b> area.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the Spring Creek Dam was to collect acid mine {{drainage}} from the old Iron Mountain Mine, which was heavily polluting Spring Creek and its tributaries. The dam was built in response to these pollutants that were contaminating <b>the</b> <b>Sacramento</b> River, the primary water supply for millions of Californians. Although the watershed is small in comparison to that of <b>the</b> <b>Sacramento</b> River, the stream is among the most polluted and acidic in the world.|$|E
5|$|Trinity River Division is {{the second}} large CVP {{department}} for the northern Sacramento Valley. The {{primary purpose of the}} division is to divert water from the Trinity River into <b>the</b> <b>Sacramento</b> River drainage downstream of Shasta Dam in order to provide more flow in <b>the</b> <b>Sacramento</b> River and generating peaking power in the process. Trinity Dam forms Trinity Lake, the second largest CVP water-storage reservoir, with just over half the capacity of Shasta and a generating capacity of 140 MW. Lewiston Dam, downstream of Trinity Dam, diverts water into the Clear Creek Tunnel, which travels to empty into a third reservoir, Whiskeytown Lake on Clear Creek, a tributary of <b>the</b> <b>Sacramento</b> River, generating 154 MW of power in the process. Whiskeytown Lake (formed by Clair. A Hill Whiskeytown Dam) in turn provides water to the Spring Creek Tunnel, which travels into the lowermost extreme of Spring Creek, a stream that flows into Keswick Reservoir, generating another 180 MW of electricity. From there the water from the Trinity River empties into Keswick Reservoir and <b>the</b> <b>Sacramento</b> River. In 1963, the Spring Creek Debris Dam was constructed just upstream of the outlet of the Spring Creek Tunnel, to prevent acid mine drainage from the Iron Mountain Mine from continuing downstream and contaminating the river.|$|E
50|$|The four Sacramento-class supply {{ships were}} {{replaced}} by the four Supply-class ships commissioned between 1994 and 1998. All of these AOEs have been operated by the MSC since 2005. As with <b>the</b> <b>Sacramentos,</b> a fifth ship was canceled.|$|R

5|$|After his retirement, Youngblood {{worked in}} player {{relations}} and marketing for the Rams from 1985–90 {{and served as}} the Rams' color analyst for the Rams Radio Network from 1986-1991. Youngblood moved to the World League of American Football as the Director of Marketing for <b>the</b> <b>Sacramento</b> Surge in 1991 (although he remained as Rams color announcer for the 1991 season), during which time the Surge won the 1992 World Bowl. He moved to <b>the</b> <b>Sacramento</b> Gold Miners of the Canadian Football League (CFL) in 1993. He {{also served as a}} color analyst for both the Surge and the Gold Miners radio networks and hosted a sports radio talk show at KHTK-AM 1140 in Sacramento, California, when that station became a sports format station in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Although the Auburn Dam is now mostly {{considered}} history, {{there are}} still proponents and groups devoted to restarting the long-inactive project. Advocates argue that the construction of Auburn {{would be the only}} solution for providing much-needed flood protection to <b>the</b> <b>Sacramento</b> area; that millions of dollars have already been spent making preparations; that it would provide an abundant supply of reliable water and hydroelectricity; and also that the recreational areas lost under the reservoir could be rebuilt around it. A major supporter of the revival of the dam is <b>the</b> <b>Sacramento</b> County Taxpayer's League; a recent survey revealed that up to two-thirds of Sacramento citizens support construction of the Auburn. They also argue that the dam would only cost $2.6 billion instead of $6–10 billion, and that it is the cheapest alternative to provide flood control for the American River.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sacramentos</b> can {{be divided}} into two sections: a main, {{northern}} section, encompassing most of the land area and all of the terrain above 7500 ft, and a smaller southeastern section, contiguous with the Guadalupe Mountains. Neighboring ranges and landforms include the Tularosa Basin, immediately {{to the west of the}} main section of the range; Sierra Blanca and the Capitan Mountains to the northwest and northeast; the Border Hills and the western edge of the broad Pecos River valley to the east; the Guadalupe Mountains to the southeast; and Otero Mesa, which lies south of the main section and southwest of the southeastern section. The Rio Tularosa and the Rio Ruidoso (and hence U.S. Route 70) separate <b>the</b> <b>Sacramentos</b> from Sierra Blanca and the Capitan Mountains.|$|R
5|$|Northwest of {{the park}} lies the Klamath Mountains (a {{collective}} term for the Siskiyou, Trinity, Salmon and Marble mountain ranges). To the west lies <b>the</b> <b>Sacramento</b> Valley.

After White's second 10-day contract expired, the Kings decided to part ways with him.|$|E
