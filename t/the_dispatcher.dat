During the entire 70 seconds of that first call, all <b>the</b> <b>dispatcher</b> heard was gunshots.

In one 911 call, gunshots can be heard.|$|E

Mikalsen also contacted the Bodø rescue team, which was equipped with a Sea King helicopter, but they told him that the helicopter had left to transport a sick child.

5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, the priority of the response to the call will be assigned by <b>the</b> <b>dispatcher,</b> but the priority of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E
25|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred after}} the Metrolink passenger train engineer, 46-year-old Robert M. Sanchez, failed to obey a red stop signal that indicated {{it was not}} safe to proceed into the single track section. The train dispatcher's computer at a remote control center in Pomona did not display a warning prior to the accident according to the NTSB. Metrolink initially reported that <b>the</b> <b>dispatcher</b> {{tried in vain to}} contact the train crew to warn them; but the NTSB contradicted this report, saying <b>the</b> <b>dispatcher</b> noticed a problem only after the accident, and was notified by the passenger train's conductor first.|$|E

2500|$|Verbal Alarms are {{the least}} common means of {{reporting}} fires or emergencies generally involves civilians [...] "verbally" [...] making such reports directly to firehouses or fire companies –or– when incidents are observed by fire units themselves when they are away from their quarters. However, [...] "verbal" [...] alarms may also be reported by chief officers, Department officials (e.g., commissioners, medical officers, chaplains, et al.) or civilian employees of the FDNY (e.g., communications electricians, mechanics and such – even <b>the</b> <b>dispatchers</b> themselves) who observe fires or emergencies {{in the course of}} the performance of their duties. If a fire company is available, in quarters, it will immediately respond to the incident after advising <b>the</b> <b>dispatchers</b> of <b>the</b> same via telephone, voice alarm or radio. If the unit is away from its firehouse (e.g., responding to or operating at another alarm, on inspection duty, etc.) at the time, the company will either stop at the new incident and operate, or the officer will request a separate assignment (as the reporting unit is unavailable to operate). Based on the information received by <b>the</b> <b>dispatchers,</b> <b>the</b> appropriate action (e.g., transmitting a new box, etc.) is initiated in regard to the new incident.|$|R
25|$|In {{the days}} before radio, {{dispatching}} locomotives involved using whatever means of communication were available.

When this was necessary, <b>the</b> <b>dispatcher</b> would call the crew to work by ringing a phone booth located next to the siding. A loud bell generally sufficed to wake up the engine crew.

25|$|The {{accident}} {{happened when}} an express train from Tabriz to Mashhad stopped because of technical {{problems associated with}} cold weather between Semnan and Damghan. The second express train, which was travelling from Semnan to Mashhad on the same track, was ordered to stop by <b>the</b> <b>dispatcher,</b> and the signals turned red. The shift for <b>the</b> <b>dispatcher</b> changed before {{the problem with the}} first train was resolved. At this point, the second train asked for permission to resume its journey which was then approved by the new dispatcher. The second train gained full speed, then hit the first train from behind. As a result of the collision four carriages derailed; two of them caught fire. Forty-seven passengers and crew from both trains were reported dead, and more than 100 reported injured. The injured were taken to hospitals in Semnan and Damghan.|$|E
