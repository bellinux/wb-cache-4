6000|$|Now for my templar {{and poet}} in {{association}} for a libel, like the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in a fiery sign. What the one wants in wit, the other must supply in law. As for malice, their quotas are indifferently well adjusted; the rough draught, I take for granted, is the poet's, <b>the</b> <b>finishings</b> the lawyer's. They begin,--that {{in order to}} one Mr Friend's commands, one of them {{went to see the}} play. This was not the poet, I am certain; for nobody saw him there, and he is not of a size to be concealed. But the mountain, they say, was delivered of a mouse. I have been gossip to many such labours of a dull fat scribbler, where the mountain has been bigger, and the mouse less. The next sally is on the city-elections, and a charge is brought against my lord mayor, and the two sheriffs, for excluding true electors. I have heard, that a Whig gentleman of the Temple hired a livery-gown, to give his voice among the companies at Guild-hall; let the question be put, whether or no he were a true elector?--Then their own juries are commended from several topics; they are the wisest, richest, and most conscientious: to which is answered, ignoramus. But our juries give most prodigious and unheard-of damages. Hitherto there is nothing but boys-play in our authors: My mill grinds pepper and spice, your mill grinds rats and mice. They go on,--"if I may be allowed to judge;" [...] (as men that do not poetize may be judges of wit, human nature, and common decencies;) so then the sentence is begun with I; there is but one of them puts in for a judge's place, that is, he in the grey; but presently it is--men; two more in buckram would be judges too. Neither of them, it seems, poetize; that is true, but both of them are in at rhime doggrel; witness the song against the bishops, and the Tunbridge ballad[35]. By the way, I find all my scribbling enemies have a mind to be judges, and chief barons. Proceed, gentlemen:--"This play, as I am informed by some, who have a nearer communication with the poets and the players, than I have,--". Which of the two Sosias is it that now speaks? If the lawyer, it is true he has but little communication with the players; if the poet, the players have but little communication with him; for it is not long ago, he said to somebody, [...] "By G----, my lord, those Tory rogues will act none of my plays." [...] Well, but the accusation,--that this play was once written by another, and then it was called the [...] "Parisian Massacre." [...] Such a play I have heard indeed was written; but I never saw it[36]. Whether this be any of it or no, I can say no more than for my own part of it. But pray, who denies the unparalleled villainy of the papists in that bloody massacre? I have enquired, why it was not acted, and heard it was stopt by the interposition of an ambassador, who was willing to save the credit of his country, and not to have the memory of an action so barbarous revived; but that I tempted my friend to alter it, is a notorious whiggism, to save the broader word. The [...] "Sicilian Vespers" [...] I have had plotted by me above these seven years: the story of it I found under borrowed names in Giraldo Cinthio; but the rape in my tragedy of [...] "Amboyna" [...] was so like it, that I forbore the writing. But what had this to do with protestants? For the massacrers and the massacred were all papists.|$|E

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi a análise macro-mecânica do comportamento da terra como argamassa para revestimentos de terra. Não foram encontradas referências a estudos semelhantes a este, tratando-se portanto de um estudo pioneiro, no Brasil e no exterior. Os revestimentos foram aplicados em um substrato de terra batida de 50 e 30 cm de altura e de largura, respectivamente. Foram analisados revestimentos fabricados com 17, 5 %, 12 %, 9 % e 6 % em peso de argila em relação ao {{material}} seco para dois solos distintos: Tassin (ilítico) e Rochechinard (caulinítico). Como revestimento de referência, foi fabricada uma argamassa de cal e areia (1 : 3). Além disso, foi avaliado o efeito da inclusão de duas fibras existentes no mercado: fibras curtas de sisal (Agave sisalana), naturais do Brasil, e resíduos de fabricação de fibras curtas de cânhamo (Cannabis sativa), provenientes da França. Tais fibras foram empregadas somente em corpos-deprova de Rochechinard com 17, 5 % e 12 % em peso de argila em relação ao material seco, e adicionadas ao solo em uma porcentagem de 0, 5 % do peso do solo seco, com as mãos. Sisal possui seção circular com valores médios de 0, 15 mm de diâmetro e 40 mm de comprimento; cânhamo é considerado como seção retangular de 2 x 5 mm de área e comprimento de 20 mm. Para todos os revestimentos foram realizadas observações visuais in situ da retração. Em seguida, os revestimentos foram ensaiados ao cisalhamento através da adição de 250 g, até a ruptura, a cada 30 s em um quadro retangular de madeira, que era pendurado nas amostras. No laboratório, a retração restringida em 4 lados e a resistência à flexão foram testadas em amostras prismáticas. Foi observado que tanto a retração quanto a resistência à flexão aumentam com o teor de argila. Além disso, os compósitos de solo com sisal apresentaram, em geral, maiores resistências àqueles em que houve emprego de cânhamo. This work {{analyzes the}} macro-mechanical behavior of earth {{when it is}} used as a raw material for finishing. It is a pioneer study in Brazil and abroad. <b>The</b> <b>finishings</b> were applied on a rammed earth wall of 50 of height and 30 cm of width. Finishings fabricated with four different clay contents (17, 5 %, 12 %, 9 % and 6 % by weight of clay in relation to the dry material) were analyzed for two different soils. Each one of these soils has a predominant type of clay: Tassin (with illite in greater quantity) and Rochechinard (with kaolinite in greater quantity). As a reference finishing, it was fabricated a mortar of lime and sand (1 : 3). Furthermore, the behavior of two fibers was evaluated: short sisal fibers (Agave sisalana), natural from Brazil, and residue from the manufacture of short hemp fibers (Cannabis sativa), from France. These fibers were used only in samples of Rochechinard with two clay contents (17. 5 % and 12 % by weight of clay in relation to the dry material). The fibers were added to the soil on a percentage of 0. 5 % by weight of dry soil, manually. Sisal has circular section with average values of 0. 15 mm of diameter and 40 mm long; hemp fiber is considered as a rectangular section with 2 mm of height, 5 mm of width and 20 mm long. For all finishings, visual observations of shrinkage were performed in situ. Those finishings with higher clay content dropped from the support. <b>The</b> <b>finishings</b> which did not fell were tested in shear. For this, a load of 250 g was added, until rupture, in every 30 s on a rectangular wood frame (600 g weight), that was hung in the samples. In laboratory, linear shrinkage and flexural strength were tested on prismatic samples. It was observed that both shrinkage and flexural strength increase with clay content. Regarding the addition of fibers, {{it was found that the}} composites fabricated with sisal had generally better results than those with hemp...|$|E
40|$|A {{piece of}} work {{carried out by the}} {{construction}} industry, whether a building or a civil engineering project, is not a mass-produced item. It is always a unique {{piece of work}}, by dint of its response to the specific needs of the owner and its potential users, its integration or otherwise into a built environment, and its construction on ground whose geo-technical properties are always specific. This unique piece of work, carried out outside on a site subject to numerous hazards, must nevertheless meet the programme's fixed objectives first time round. Unfortunately, unlike most industrial products, it is usually, even nowadays, the outcome of a fragmented approach: designers and builders of the shell of the building and those engaged in <b>the</b> <b>finishings</b> are in fact involved in a segmented and sequential process, without any real interaction between the various disciplines, to the detriment of overall quality and the cost of the end-product. The author of this thesis has had the opportunity, in his professional career in the management of major construction companies, of testing most organisational forms in the sector. He has observed that, depending on the model chosen, they exercise a more or less beneficial effect on quality, costs and time-frames for completing the works, {{as well as on the}} capacity for innovation of the participants themselves. The first objective of the thesis was to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the most common organisational models in the construction industry and to identify factors in the success of the construction process. The second objective was to suggest an original organisational model which would make optimum use of these factors, taking into account modern organisational theory and project management. The first section of the thesis is an historical study of organisational forms of construction from antiquity to the modern times, and examines in particular the relationships between those actively and directly involved (owner, designers and builders) and their relationships in turn with those involved indirectly (users, public administration, finance providers, environmental and heritage protection organisations, laws and standards, etc.). This historical perspective makes a useful contribution because, although much has been written on architecture and architects, especially the most famous among them, and sometimes on engineers, work looking systematically at the organisational forms used in the construction industry over the centuries is rare. This study demonstrates that the fragmented organisation of construction characteristic of the 20 th century is merely an accident in the long history of construction; the twenty-five preceding centuries almost always favoured close collaboration between designers and builders and the wonderful works they left behind demonstrate the wisdom of this approach. Study of the history also provides us with a list of the main success factors and the demands to which the successful organisation of construction must respond. The second part endeavours to verify the relevance of the needs drawn, in the light of modern organisational theory, from project management and creativity, and to complete the list. It goes on to analyse on that basis the strengths and weaknesses of the organisational models most commonly used in the modern construction industry and demonstrates that organisation as a design and build, is in the best position at this stage in the research to meet the needs of owners. The third section verifies, through case studies of five pieces of work recently completed or under construction, whether this organisational model effectively satisfies the expectations of those involved in the construction project, simultaneously examining potential improvements. To that end, a series of interviews was conducted in each case study, with a view to eliciting the views of representative participants: owner, operator, user, project manager, architect, engineer and sub-contracting trades. The process was completed with an analysis of the attitude of some public sector owners to the design and build organisational model. Finally, the lessons drawn from these case studies were used to complete the list of success factors already identified. A final section sets out an original organisational model named Integrated Construction Management (ICM), which recommends an inter-disciplinary approach to construction and responds to the success factors identified in the first three sections. It involves a new division of the production process, which provides the owner with a broader and more cost-effective range of innovative architectural and construction options. It also delivers a series of practical recommendations to assist in the application of the proposed model. In conclusion, Integrated Construction Management places the owner at the centre of a transparent and progressive production process, simultaneously removing the majority of the risks involved in construction. Through its inter-disciplinary approach, it offers innovative solutions together with improvements to the overall quality of the piece of work itself on favourable economic terms. Finally, it enables the owner to take informed decisions and to use his or her financial resources as and when the feasibility of the project is confirmed. It is hoped that, as a result, these advantages will be demonstrated through pilot projects carried out using the ICM model, which will without doubt make possible further improvements in performance...|$|E
