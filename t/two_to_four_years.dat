Outbreak cycles are more strongly synchronized in eastern Canada than in western Canada. Where spatially separated populations are phase-synchronized, the synchronization {{is thought to be}} due to the process of entrainment, that is, the synchronization of a circadian clock with the external environment.|$|E

Bands usually break apart every eight to nine years as a new band forms in a new home range.|$|E
