Should our Republic ever forget this fundamental precept of governance, we will then, be surely doomed." ...|$|E

[...] Tasan himself was an advocate of an advocate of a [...] "people-oriented" [...] (minbon) theory of history.

To which end, Papen called {{for the creation of}} the volksgemeinschaft (the [...] "people's community" [...] or [...] "national community") that would unite the German people as one.
