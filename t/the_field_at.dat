The French withdrew to Engen and Stockach, where {{a few days later}} the armies engaged again, this time with greater losses on both sides, and an Austrian victory.|$|E

50|$|It {{also became}} evident {{that as the}} club grew, <b>the</b> two <b>fields</b> <b>at</b> Newsome High School and Sports College alone {{would not be enough}} to stage the number of games {{required}} each weekend.

Clemson attempted a two-point conversion, but the try failed and the Tigers simply tied the Yellow Jackets, 13–13.|$|E
5|$|Despite England {{going into}} the series as the favourites, West Indies won the series 1–0 after winning the first match at Sabina Park. The {{remaining}} matches all ended in draws. The series was originally intended as a four Test series; however the abandonment of the Second Test due to the conditions of <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>at</b> the SVR Stadium in Antigua led to the rapid inclusion of an additional game staged at the Antigua Recreation Ground, resulting in a five, rather than four match Test series.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a tumultuous}} {{pre-season}} {{in which they}} went {{through a period of}} administration and were saved by late investment, Manor Marussia arrived in Melbourne with a car that had passed its mandatory crash tests, but had completed no testing.

However, the team did not participate in any practice sessions and subsequently failed to set a qualifying time, leaving <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>at</b> eighteen cars for the race.|$|E

These new jet aircraft would never see widespread combat with JG 1 due to their late introduction and a shortage of pilots, aircraft and fuel. JG 1 could no longer field their full complement or effectively fly operations as required.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the harvest}} year {{blueberry}} growers rent honey bee hives to put in their fields for pollination.

The hives are placed in <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>at</b> 10-20% bloom allowing the bees to have enough forage in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> rather than going else where to forage.

5|$|Tech {{took over}} at its 13-yard line {{following}} the 63-yard punt but went three {{and out and}} was itself forced to punt. Air Force's offense returned to <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>at</b> its 47-yard line after the kick. The Falcons picked up one first down, but the Tech defense stiffened and forced a fourth down. Needing just inches to gain a first down, Air Force elected to attempt to gain the needed yardage rather than punt the ball away. But before the Falcons could start the play, time ran out in the third quarter. With one quarter remaining, the Falcons still held a 107 lead.|$|E

After getting inside of the stadium with their gold 1924 Ford Model T, the two were finally stopped by Georgia officials who were informed the real Ramblin' Wreck had remained in Atlanta.|$|E
