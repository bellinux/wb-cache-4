5|$|Assembly – Following the structure-mediated {{self-assembly}} of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> particles, some {{modification of}} the proteins often occurs.

5|$|The American robin is a known {{reservoir}} (carrier) for West Nile virus. While crows and jays {{are often}} the first noticed deaths in an area with West Nile virus, the American robin is suspected {{to be a key}} host, and holds a larger responsibility for the transmission of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> to humans. This is because, while crows and jays die quickly from <b>the</b> <b>virus,</b> the American robin survives <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> longer, hence spreading it to more mosquitoes, which then transmit <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> to humans and other species.|$|E
5|$|VP4 is on {{the surface}} of the virion that {{protrudes}} as a spike. It binds to molecules {{on the surface of}} cells called receptors and drives the entry of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> into the cell. VP4 has to be modified by the protease enzyme trypsin, which is found in the gut, into VP5* and VP8* before <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> is infectious. VP4 determines how virulent <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> is and it determines the P-type of <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|E
30|$|It {{has been}} proved that there exists a {{stability}} switch in <b>the</b> delayed computer <b>virus</b> spreading model by taking the delay as the bifurcation parameter.

However, <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> will be out of control when the delay passes through the critical value. Based on the simulation results, we can conclude that <b>the</b> computer <b>viruses</b> can be controlled by shortening the latent period of <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> and <b>the</b> period that the anti-virus software uses to clean <b>the</b> <b>viruses.</b>|$|R

5|$|Antibodies can {{continue}} {{to be an effective}} defence mechanism even after viruses have managed to gain entry to the host cell. A protein that is in cells, called TRIM21, can attach to the antibodies on the surface of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> particle. This primes the subsequent destruction of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> by the enzymes of the cell's proteosome system.|$|E
5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> to {{specific}} molecules {{on the surface}} of the cell. This specificity restricts <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.|$|E
5|$|Concern {{has been}} {{expressed}} by some that artificial gene synthesis {{could be used}} to recreate <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> from existing digital genomes, for use in biological warfare.

40|$|Life forms can {{be roughly}} {{differentiated}} into {{those that are}} microscopic versus {{those that are not}} as well as those that are multicellular and those that, instead, are unicellular. Cellular organisms seem generally able to host viruses, and this propensity carries over to those that are both microscopic and less than truly multicellular. These viruses of microorganisms, or VoMs, in fact exist as the world’s most abundant somewhat autonomous genetic entities and include <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> of domain Bacteria (bacteriophages), <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> of domain Archaea (archaeal <b>viruses),</b> <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> of protists, <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> of microscopic fungi such as yeasts (mycoviruses), and even <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> of other viruses (satellite viruses). In this paper we provide an introduction to <b>the</b> concept of <b>viruses</b> of microorganisms, a. k. a., viruses of microbes. We provide broad discussion particularly of VoM diversity. VoM diversity currently spans, in total, at least three-dozen virus families. This is roughly ten families per category—bacterial, archaeal, fungal, and protist—with some virus families infecting more than one of these microorganism major taxa. Such estimations, however, will vary with further discovery and taxon assignment and also are dependent upon what forms of life one includes among microorganisms...|$|R

5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and {{biological}} properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> may become latent, allowing <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.|$|E

5|$|However, while {{pleasing}} to Riker's mind, the passionate dreams only worsen Riker's condition, as <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> feeds {{on the positive}} endorphins his brain is creating. Pulaski and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) therefore agree {{to try to make}} the machine evoke negative dreams instead. Thus Riker dreams of Lieutenant Tasha Yar's (Denise Crosby) death, or the apparent death of Deanna Troi's child (R. J. Williams). This has the desired effect, as the negative endorphins drive <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> away, but the endorphins are not strong enough. As a last resort, Pulaski uses the machine to evoke dreams of raw, primitive feelings of fear and survival. Thus Riker dreams of fighting the tar creature Armus (Mart McChesney), the alien-controlled Admiral Gregory Quinn (Ward Costello), and the Klingon officer Klag (Brian Thompson) on board the warship Pagh. Seeing that the raw emotions work best, Pulaski intensifies the dreams to come at a more rapid pace. This finally kills <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> and Riker recovers.|$|E
