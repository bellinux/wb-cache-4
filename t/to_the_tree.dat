5|$|In 2006, Marcelo Weksler {{published}} a large-scale cladistic analysis of Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), the group (tribe) to which hammondi {{and the related}} species mentioned above belong. He used both morphological and molecular characters, but had only morphological data for Oryzomys hammondi. The placement of the species in his results was unstable; some trees placed it close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> rice rats, Oecomys, within clade B and others placed it as an isolated lineage, basal to all other Oryzomyini.|$|E

5|$|The {{plight of}} Cordyline australis in the Sudden Decline {{epidemic}} {{drew attention to}} another widespread threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> in rural areas throughout New Zealand. Rural Decline was the name proposed by botanists {{to refer to a}} decline in health of older trees in pasture and grazed shrubland, leading over many years to the loss of upper branches and eventual death.|$|E
5|$|The tree {{may also}} be {{attacked}} by the horse chestnut scale insect (Pulvinaria regalis) which sucks sap from the trunk and branches, but does not cause serious damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> Sometimes squirrels will strip the bark off branches, girdling the stem; as a result whole branches may die, leaving brown, wilted leaves.|$|E
5|$|Dawn of Mana {{opens on}} the fictional island of Illusia, {{a place where}} the giant Mana Tree lies dormant. Much of the story takes place on Fa'Diel, a {{continent}} composed of the five nations of Jadd, Topple, Ishe, Wendell, and Lorimar. At the start of the game Ritzia, a Maiden in charge of tending <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tree,</b> and Keldric, her knight and the player-controlled character, have left their village to find Ritzia's missing pet. While they are out, Illusia is attacked by King Stroud of Lorimar. The pair rush <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tree</b> of Mana, thinking that Stroud intends to attack the legendary beast that lies sleeping underneath its roots. While searching for the beast, Keldric finds a seed of the Tree, which attaches to his arm and can transform into a slingshot, a whip, or a sword. They also find Faye, a spirit child, who can cast magic and joins them. When they reach the center of the labyrinth of roots, Stroud's men catch up to them; they had been searching for Ritzia, not the beast. Stroud intends to open a portal to Mavolia, a land of darkness sealed away for centuries, and believes Ritzia is part of the key as a Maiden had been a part of opening the portal before. Stroud leaves with Ritzia to find the rest of the key, and Keldric and Faye chase after them.|$|E
50|$|Parallax method 3-D is {{a survey}} {{technique}} for measuring <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> height indirectly by Michael Taylor. The parallax method involves finding two different views <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree's</b> top, <b>the</b> ground level differential and horizontal sweep angles between {{the top and}} the two views. These values {{can be used in}} an algebraic equation <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> height of <b>the</b> <b>tree’s</b> top above <b>the</b> stations can be calculated. No direct measurement <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree's</b> trunk or top is taken in the parallax Method.|$|R

5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> of heaven's weedy habit, {{landowners and}} other organisations often resort to various methods {{of control in}} order to keep its populations in check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an {{eradication}} program for the tree. It can be very difficult to eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control. It involves the application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.|$|E
5|$|Finn wanders {{all over}} Ooo until {{he manages to}} locate Jake, who is {{fulfilling}} a bizarre lifelong ambition of being a brick inside a shack as it collapses. Finn expresses his support, but decides to head back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tree</b> Fort. He leaves a walkie talkie with Jake. After {{a period of time}} passes, Jake begins absentmindedly narrating the events around him. Finn and BMO are drawn into Jake's storytelling, and Finn uses Starchy's radio station to broadcast Jake's narration.|$|E
5|$|In their 1914 Flora of Jamaica, William Fawcett and Alfred Barton Rendle linked Sloane's {{illustration}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> {{species that}} was then known as Ficus suffocans, a name that {{had been assigned to}} it in August Grisebach's Flora of the British West Indian Islands. Gordon DeWolf agreed with their conclusion and used the name F. maxima for that species in the 1960 Flora of Panama. Since this use has become widespread, Berg proposed that the name Ficus maxima be conserved in the way DeWolf had used it, a proposal that was accepted by the nomenclatural committee.|$|E

5|$|Peniophora quercina {{typically}} grows upon dead wood, {{which can}} be attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> or fallen, where it causes white rot. It favours oak, but {{can also be found}} on other deciduous trees, such as beech. P.quercina is known to be a pioneer species on dead wood, which means it can be the first species to grow. It is found in Europe, where it is very common. Though it can be encountered all year, it produces spores in late summer and autumn. It has also been recorded in Amur, in eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Protesters {{continued}} {{to delay the}} destruction of the tree. Solicitors for the campaign had even argued in court that receipt of a letter addressed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> itself gave it the status of a legal dwelling, causing a further delay,. In the early morning of 7 December 1993, several hundred police arrived to evict the protesters, which took ten hours to carry out. Protesters made numerous complaints against the police; police, in turn, denied these allegations, attributing any misbehaviour to the protesters. Media attention started to increase regarding the protest, with several daily newspapers putting pictures of the tree on their front pages.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of Hilton Head as a resort started in 1956 with Charles E. Fraser developing Sea Pines Resort. Soon, other developments followed, such as Hilton Head Plantation, Palmetto Dunes Plantation, Shipyard Plantation, and Port Royal Plantation, imitating Sea Pines' architecture and landscape. Sea Pines however continued {{to stand out}} by creating a unique locality within the plantation called Harbour Town, anchored by a recognizable lighthouse. Fraser was a committed environmentalist who changed the whole configuration of the marina at Harbour Town to save an ancient live oak. It {{came to be known}} as the Liberty Oak, known to generations of children who watched singer and songwriter Gregg Russell perform under the tree for over 25 years. Fraser was buried next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> when he died in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The grey jay (Perisoreus canadensis), also gray jay, Canada jay, or whisky jack, is a {{passerine}} bird of {{the family}} Corvidae. It is found in boreal forests of North America north <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> line, and in the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone south to New Mexico and Arizona. A fairly large songbird, the grey jay has pale grey underparts, darker grey upperparts, and a grey-white head with a darker grey nape. It {{is one of three}} members of the genus Perisoreus, a small genus more closely related to the Cyanopica genus of magpies than to other birds known as jays. The grey jay itself has nine recognized subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} into the fire was led by the Division of Forestry's chief investigator, Sam Butcher. The investigation lasted four months, and once a suspect had been identified, the case {{was turned over to}} the Webster County prosecuting attorney's office. Butcher credited Art Yagel, a Division of Forestry investigator, for bringing the investigation to its conclusion. In January 2008, a 17-year-old suspect from Bergoo was formally charged with a felony count of arson for setting fire <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree,</b> while a second juvenile was also charged with a misdemeanor for providing false information to investigators. The suspect was also charged with misdemeanor counts of providing false information to conservation officers, possession of marijuana, and underage consumption of alcohol. The second juvenile was not involved in the setting of the fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{island has}} three endemic species of tree, the Arran {{whitebeam}}s. These trees are the Scottish or Arran whitebeam (Sorbus arranensis), the bastard mountain ash or cut-leaved whitebeam (Sorbus pseudofennica) and the Catacol whitebeam (Sorbus pseudomeinichii). If rarity {{is measured by}} numbers alone they are amongst the most endangered tree species in the world. They are protected in Glen Diomhan off Glen Catacol, {{at the north end}} of the island by a partly fenced off national nature reserve, and are monitored by staff from Scottish Natural Heritage. Only 236 Sorbus pseudofennica and 283 Sorbus arranensis were recorded as mature trees in 1980. They are typically trees of the mountain slopes, close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> line. However, they will grow at lower altitudes, and are being preserved within Brodick Country Park.|$|E
