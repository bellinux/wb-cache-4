25|$|Another {{cause of}} vitamin C being lost from food is leaching, where the {{water-soluble}} vitamin dissolves into the cooking water, which is later poured away and not consumed. However, vitamin C does not leach in all vegetables {{at the same}} rate; research shows broccoli seems to retain more than any other. Research has also shown that freshly cut fruits do not lose significant nutrients when stored in <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> <b>for</b> a few days.|$|E
25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored in <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> <b>for</b> a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen {{for up to two}} or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E

As a results the adiabatic demagnetization of crystals of the rare-earth aluminogarnets was suggested and realized for the first time. The method of measuring of the concentration of the rare-earth ions in the crystals of aluminogarnets was developed. New fields of application for the rare-earth aluminogarnets in the low temperature physical experiment were suggested: thermometry and magnetic cooling.
