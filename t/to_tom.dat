5|$|Many of {{the ideas}} for the series {{originated}} in an unpublished educational comic book titled The Intertidal Zone, which Hillenburg created in 1989. He began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 upon the cancellation of Rocko's Modern Life, and turned <b>to</b> <b>Tom</b> Kenny, {{who had worked with}} him on that series, to voice the title character. SpongeBob was originally going to be named SpongeBoy, and the series was to be called SpongeBoy Ahoy!, but both of these were changed, as the name was already trademarked.|$|E

It soon became apparent that McCloskey had financial problems, so the NFL found a replacement in Hugh Culverhouse. They were purchased by Malcolm Glazer in 1995 for $192 million, following Culverhouse's death. The front office staff of the team includes Bryan Glazer, Edward Glazer, and Joel Glazer.|$|E

Le won a unanimous decision by exercising great footwork, trips and takedowns and effective striking.|$|E
5|$|As had Virginia Tech, Air Force {{began moving}} {{the ball on}} the ground. The Falcons were aided by two offsides {{penalties}} against the Hokies and drove into Tech territory. Once there, Weiss completed a 16-yard pass <b>to</b> <b>Tom</b> Coleman for a first down. Weiss picked up another first down by running the ball, pushing the Falcons inside the Tech red zone with 10:10 remaining. The Tech defense stiffened, forcing a fourth down at the two-yard line. Rather than kick a field goal, Fisher DeBerry elected to attempt the touchdown, and Mike Brown ran the needed twoyards. The score and following extra point gave Air Force a 177 lead with 6:00 remaining in the game.|$|E

5|$|Cardiff City {{qualified}} for the 1927 FA Charity Shield as winners of the 1926–27 FA Cup. They defeated Arsenal by one goal to nil, with the only goal of the game coming from Hughie Ferguson. It was the club's first FA Cup victory, and {{the only time that}} the trophy had been won by a club outside of England. A few months after Cardiff's victory, the match between them and Corinthians for the FA Charity Shield was set to take place at Stamford Bridge on 12 October.

5|$|For Green Granite, Penney {{proposed}} a design based on radiation implosion and staging. There would be three stages, {{which he called}} Tom, Dick and Harry. Tom, the primary stage, would be a fission bomb. It would produce radiation to implode a secondary, Dick, another fission service. In turn, it would implode Harry, a thermonuclear tertiary. Henceforth, the British designers would refer <b>to</b> <b>Tom,</b> Dick and Harry rather than primary, secondary and tertiary. They still had only vague ideas about how a thermonuclear weapon would work, and whether one, two, or three stages would be required. Nor was there much more certainty about the boosted designs, with no agreement on whether the boosting thermonuclear fuel was best placed inside the hollow core, as in Orange Herald, or wrapped around it, as in Green Bamboo. Keith Roberts and John Ward studied the detonation waves in a thermonuclear detonation, {{but there was an}} incomplete understanding of radiation implosion.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) and the Pawnee parks {{department}} {{prepares for}} a visit by park department officials from Boraqua, Pawnee's Sister City in Venezuela.

Later, the Venezuelan delegation arrives, headed by their parks department vice director Raul Alejandro Bastilla Pedro de Veloso de Morana, the Vice-director Ejecutivo del Diputado del Departmento de Parques, L.G.V. (Fred Armisen), Antonio, Jhonny and Elvis. There are cultural clashes right away, like when they mistake Tom (Aziz Ansari) for a servant and order him to get their bags. They also mistakenly believe they can choose any woman to have sex with; they all favor Donna (Retta). Raul and Leslie exchange gifts during a meet-and-greet party, where Raul and the Venezuelans act condescending toward the Pawnee residents, making offensive remarks about the town and mocking the gifts Leslie gives them. They continue to give orders <b>to</b> <b>Tom,</b> who follows along because they give him large cash tips.|$|E
5|$|London was {{the premier}} centre for boxing because the aristocratic {{supporters}} of the sport dispersed to their country estates {{during the summer months}} but tended to congregate in the city for the winter period. Birmingham was often portrayed as second only to London for the sport and in 1789 there were a series of challenges issued by fighters from the Birmingham area to opponents based around London. The challenges were intended to demonstrate the level of organisation and confidence among the Birmingham boxers and their supporters. Three of these challenges were accepted, including that from Perrins <b>to</b> <b>Tom</b> Johnson. Perrins had already issued a general challenge, offering to fight any man in England for a prize of 500 guineas, having beaten all challengers in the counties around Birmingham.|$|E
