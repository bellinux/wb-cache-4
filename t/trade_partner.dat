5|$|Following the Spanish–American War in 1898, this {{aggressive}} interpretation {{was used}} to create a U.S. economic empire across the Caribbean, such as with the 1903 treaty with Cuba that was heavily tilted in the U.S.' favor. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt believed that the U.S. should be the main beneficiary of production in Central America. The U.S. enforced this hegemony with armed interventions in Nicaragua (1912–33), and Haiti (1915–34). The U.S. did not need to use its military might in Guatemala, where a series of dictators were willing to accommodate the economic interests of the U.S. in return for its support for their regimes. Guatemala was among the Central American countries of the period known as a banana republic. From 1890 to 1920, control of Guatemala's resources and its economy shifted away from Britain and Germany to the U.S., which became Guatemala's dominant <b>trade</b> <b>partner.</b> The Monroe Doctrine continued to be seen as relevant to Guatemala, and {{was used to}} justify the coup in 1954.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch were ill-prepared {{to resist}} such an invasion. When Hitler came to power, the Dutch {{had begun to}} re-arm, but more slowly than France or Belgium; only in 1936 did the defence budget start to be {{gradually}} increased. Successive Dutch governments tended to avoid openly identifying Germany as an acute military threat. Partly this {{was caused by a}} wish not to antagonise a vital <b>trade</b> <b>partner,</b> {{even to the point of}} repressing criticism of Nazi policies; partly it was made inevitable by a policy of strict budgetary limits with which the conservative Dutch governments tried in vain to fight the Great Depression, which hit Dutch society particularly hard. Hendrikus Colijn, prime minister between 1933 and 1939, was personally convinced Germany would not violate Dutch neutrality; senior officers made no effort to mobilise public opinion in favour of improving military defence.|$|E
25|$|As of 2014, India is {{the third-largest}} Asian <b>trade</b> <b>partner</b> of Israel, and tenth-largest <b>trade</b> <b>partner</b> overall. In 2014, {{bilateral}} trade, excluding military sales, stood at US$4.52 billion. Relations further expanded during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration, with India abstaining from voting against Israel in the United Nations in several resolutions.

40|$|A central {{statement}} {{of the theory of}} natural <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> is that preferential trading with regional <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> is less likely to be trade diverting and therefore geographically proximate partners are to be considered "natural" partners for preferential arrangements. This paper examines this question empirically. The analytical framework involves a general equilibrium model of preferential trade and an econometric model with tight links to this theory. This framework is used to implement tests of the natural <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> hypothesis using U. S. trade data for the years 196495 : Welfare changes that would result from preferential tariff reductions by the United States against various <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> are first estimated, and correlations with bilateral "distance" measures (with and without controls for income levels) are then examined. Since the argument for "natural" <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> is based on the greater likelihood of geographically proximate countries to be more significant <b>trading</b> <b>partners,</b> correlations between the welfare change estimates and bilateral trade volume are examined as well. Both geographic proximity and trade volume are found to have no effect. Thus this paper is unable to find any support for the natural <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> theory in U. S. data. ...|$|R

25|$|Trade volume between China and Russia reached $29.1billion in 2005, an {{increase}} of 37.1% compared with 2004. A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, Van Jingsun, said that the volume of trade between China and Russia could exceed 40 billion dollars in 2007. China's export of machinery and electronic goods to Russia grew 70%, which is 24% of China's total export to Russia in the first 11months of 2005. During the same time, China's export of high-tech products to Russia increased by 58%, and that is 7% of China's total exports to Russia. Also at that time period, border trade {{between the two countries}} reached $5.13billion, growing 35% and accounting for nearly 20% of the total trade. Most of China's exports to Russia remain apparel and footwear. Russia is China's eighth largest <b>trade</b> <b>partner</b> and China is now Russia's fourth largest <b>trade</b> <b>partner,</b> and China now has over 750 investment projects in Russia, involving $1.05billion. China's contracted investment in Russia totaled $368million during January–September 2005, twice that in 2004.|$|E

The Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry responded on 7 June 2011 and suspended all live animal exports to Indonesia “for slaughter following evidence of animal welfare abuses in some abattoirs”. The ban caused beef scarcity and price-hikes in Indonesian markets, leading some in Indonesia to see Australia as an unreliable <b>trade</b> <b>partner.</b>|$|E
25|$|Denmark's active liberal {{trade policy}} in the European Union, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and World Trade Organization largely coincides with U.S. interests. The U.S. is Denmark's largest non-European <b>trade</b> <b>partner</b> with about 5% of Danish {{merchandise}} trade. Denmark's role in European environmental and agricultural issues and its strategic location {{at the entrance to}} the Baltic Sea have made Copenhagen a center for U.S. agencies and the private sector dealing with the Nordic/Baltic region.|$|E

40|$|Chinese {{rare earth}} export {{policies}} currently result in accelerating its depletion. Thus adopting an optimal export trade selection strategy {{is crucial to}} determining and ultimately identifying the ideal <b>trading</b> <b>partners.</b> This paper introduces a multi-attribute decision-making methodology which is then used to select the optimal <b>trading</b> <b>partner.</b> In the method, an evaluation criteria system is established to assess the seven top <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> based on three dimensions: political relationships, economic benefits and industrial security. Specifically, a simple additive weighing model derived from an additive utility function is utilized to calculate, rank and select alternatives. Results show that Japan would be the optimal <b>trading</b> <b>partner</b> for Chinese rare earths. The criteria evaluation method of <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> for China’s rare earth exports provides the Chinese government with a tool to enhance rare earth industrial policies...|$|R

If such a deal were struck, though, and South Sudan began exporting oil from Kenyan ports, the US would become a potential <b>trade</b> <b>partner</b> and South Sudanese oil importer. In the meantime, the South Sudanese government intends to lobby the US to ease restrictions on American companies doing business with Sudan.|$|E
