5|$|Some {{branches}} of feminism closely track the political leanings of <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>society,</b> such as liberalism and conservatism, or {{focus on the}} environment. Liberal feminism seeks individualistic equality {{of men and women}} through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society. Catherine Rottenberg has argued that the neoliberal shirt in Liberal feminism has led to that form of feminism being individualized rather than collectivized and becoming detached from social inequality. Due to this she argues that Liberal Feminism cannot offer any sustained analysis of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege.|$|E
25|$|The {{challenge}} for the psychology of religion is essentially threefold: (1) to provide a thoroughgoing description of the objects of investigation, whether they be shared religious content (e.g., a tradition's ritual observances) or individual experiences, attitudes, or conduct; (2) to account in psychological terms for the rise of such phenomena; and (3) to clarify the outcomes—the fruits, as William James put it—of these phenomena, for individuals and for <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} reasons for the history and {{continued}} prevalence of racial segregation in U.S. churches, including racism, denominational differences, and isolation.

However, segregated Black churches also have been a positive place for community organizing for civil rights and other issues, as well as offering a respite for Black individuals from the racism they face in integrated society.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the rise}} of gay {{cruising}} and gay nightclubs {{led to the formation}} of informal social networks of friends. Within these networks, information and rumours spread within the gay community about the sexuality of local television, sports and entertainment celebrities, university professors, children and relatives of politicians, and even the occasional Cabinet minister himself. This form of informal networking and 'knowledge' constituted the nascent beginnings of a gay community, which was beginning to acquire a sense of itself within <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the West, a man often cannot {{acknowledge}} or display {{sexual attraction}} for another man without the homosexual or bisexual label being attached to him. The same pattern of shunning the homosexual identity, while still {{having sex with}} men, is prevalent in the non-West, where sexual attraction between men is often seen as a universal male phenomenon—and practised, either quietly or openly—even if held morally wrong in <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>society,</b> sexual attraction between men being seen as a universal male quality, not something limited to a minority.|$|E
25|$|Because chronic self-concepts and {{self-esteem}} {{play an important}} role in understanding the world, providing a sense of coherence, and guiding action, people become motivated to maintain them through self-verification.

Self-verification processes are also adaptive for groups, groups of diverse backgrounds and <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>society,</b> in that they make people predictable to one another thus serve to facilitate social interaction. To this end, people engage in a variety of activities that are designed to obtain self-verifying information.|$|E

There were also differing opinions as to whether non-religious persons should be made members of the PCRH. Another concern was that the composition of the PCRH should be a fair representation of all the major religions in Singapore. It was pointed out that the diversity within religions such as Christianity made it difficult for fair representation and might lead to the exclusion of smaller and independent religious bodies.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the Bedouin {{society was}} nomadic, pastoral, and {{agricultural}} based. Within this system, labor was divided along gender lines. Women were traditionally {{in charge of}} the agricultural activities, which included herding, grazing, fetching water, and raising crops, while men were in charge of guarding their land and receiving visitors. Bedouin culture, especially as it relates to gender norms, developed around this economic structure. In accordance with these traditional economic roles, women in Bedouin society did not interact with strangers, especially unfamiliar men. Bedouin men mediated most of the interactions their families have with <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b> As such, Bedouin culture became highly patriarchal. Within this traditional system, the men have held most of the power, but the vital economic roles of the women granted them significant degree of influence over the household decision-making.|$|E
25|$|Further studies {{reveal that}} the {{identification}} of second-generation immigrants, of Caribbean heritage, as African Americans leads these children to be more aware of racial discrimination in the U.S. In addition, the assimilation into black society and black culture in the U.S. by these children is hindered by their parents' oppositional stance to American black culture, contributing to identity conflict. In the case of Haitians, first generation Haitians hold on strongly to their foreign identity, as they associate the preservation of their culture with stronger solidarity in the community. These first generation Haitians attempt to instill this same Haitian pride in their children as they want the children to succeed {{on the basis of}} ethnic solidarity and the preservation of Haitian culture, and not by giving in to American culture. This creates a clash between the ideas and values these children learn at home, and from their peers and the non-Haitian black community. Thus, these children face conflicting pressures from family, non-second generation immigrant peers, and discrimination by <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E

500|$|The goal of his [...] "peace policy" [...] was to {{minimize}} military {{conflict with the}} Indians, looking forward to [...] "any course toward them which tends to their civilization and ultimate citizenship". [...] Indians were to stay on reservations where they would receive government subsidies and training supervised by religious denominations. Indians were no longer allowed to engage in raids or send war parties off the reservations; the Army's job was to force them back. The goal was to assimilate the Indians into American society; any Indian could leave the reservation {{at any time and}} join <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>society,</b> and have full citizenship. The Indians on reservations were made U.S. citizens in 1924.|$|E
500|$|Since their movement's {{emergence}} {{early in}} the 20th century, Pentecostals saw themselves as [...] "peculiar people", {{and one of the}} components of this identity were particular prohibitions on behavior. Prohibitions on drug use, gambling, social dancing, consuming alcohol, smoking, attending theaters, bowling, swimming in public pools and beaches, owning television sets, and restrictions on feminine attire and fashion helped distinguish Pentecostals from <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b> Starting in the 1950s, attitudes in the Assemblies of God on many of these activities underwent dramatic change. The most change probably occurred over views on women's attire, with the former stance against wearing make-up and jewelry giving way to the acceptance of popular fashion. Most of these [...] "holiness standards" [...] are no longer adhered to; however, some are still held to, such as proscriptions on smoking, alcohol and drug use.|$|E
500|$|Durkheim {{also argued}} that our primary {{categories}} for understanding the world have their origins in religion. It is religion, Durkheim writes, {{that gave rise to}} most if not all other social constructs, including <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b> Durkheim argued that categories are produced by the society, and thus are collective creations. Thus as people create societies, they also create categories, but at the same time, they do so unconsciously, and the categories are prior to any individual's experience. In this way Durkheim attempted to bridge the divide between seeing categories as constructed out of human experience and as logically prior to that experience. Our understanding of the world is shaped by social facts; for example the notion of time is defined by being measured through a calendar, which in turn was created to allow us to keep track of our social gatherings and rituals; those in turn on their most basic level originated from religion. In the end, even the most logical and rational pursuit of science can trace its origins to religion. Durkheim states that, [...] "Religion gave birth to all that is essential in the society.|$|E

500|$|On 11 June 1932, de Mena married Percy Aiken, a Jamaican {{contractor}} and activist, {{who would become}} {{an officer in the}} island's Bahá'í Faith. Garvey tried to bring the UNIA back to its former status from Jamaica, continuing to write articles for the Negro World and developing two other short-lived papers, The Blackman and The New Jamaican, but all had folded by 1933. In 1934, now adopting her new husband's surname and styled as [...] "Madame Aiken" [...] she began a newspaper using the presses of the Negro World called the World Echo. While the paper ostensibly was to be another organ for UNIA, many of the articles were devoted to Father Divine's Peace Mission. Aiken used the paper to call for anti-lynching legislation and championed African-American civil rights, including liberation in [...] "spiritual, economic, political and industrial emancipation". Father Divine's movement was in direct opposition to Garvey's, in that Garvey pressed for racial consciousness and purity, while Divine argued that race was unimportant and that blacks had to integrate into <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b> The opposing voices of these two movements were difficult for Aiken {{and other members of the}} diaspora to reconcile. She finally closed both the newspaper and UNIA's offices in New York, moving to Jamaica in 1935. Though she continued some involvement with UNIA through the 1950s, the organization was in decline. Garvey's financial problems resulted in the foreclosure of his home, and by 1935, he permanently relocated to London. Around the same time, Aiken withdrew her support from Father Divine and restyled the World Echo into the Ethiopian World. Though many deserted Garvey, Aiken maintained a good relationship with him until his death.|$|E
500|$|Scholar Yolanda M. Manora {{insisted that}} three women in Caged Bird—the [...] "hybridized mother" [...] of Angelou's {{grandmother}}, her mother, {{and her friend}} Mrs. Flowers—taught her {{how to be a}} mother to her son Guy. Although Angelou's grandmother died early in the series, in her third autobiography Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas, Angelou quoted her many times throughout the series. Angelou's desire for security for Guy drove her to marry Tosh Angelos in Singin' and Swingin, and drove many of her decisions, job choices, and romantic relationships. Scholar Siphokazi Koyana stated that due to Angelou's race and economic background, her [...] "experience of motherhood is inseparably intertwined with work". [...] According to Koyana, [...] "...Black motherhood always encompassed work". Angelou's long list of occupations attested to the challenges, especially in her second autobiography Gather Together in My Name, she faced as a working teenager mother, which often led Angelou to questionable decisions. [...] Koyana stated that it was not until Angelou was {{able to take advantage of}} opportunities, such as her role in Porgy and Bess, when she was able to fully support her and Guy, and the quality of her life and her contribution to society improved. [...] It was impossible, however, for Angelou to become successful without her extended family to provide childcare for her; i.e., when she left Guy in the care of his grandmother in spite of the conflict and guilt she experienced as a result (something Koyana insisted was imposed on her by <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>society),</b> a pattern established in Caged Bird by her own mother when she left Angelou and her brother in the care of Angelou's grandmother.|$|E

2500|$|Margarite Fernandez Olmos {{comments}} on the novel's pioneering position in the Chicano literary tradition: [...] "Bless Me, Ultima blazed a path within the Chicano literary tradition in the [...] novels of identity in which the main characters must redefine themselves within <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>society</b> {{from the vantage point}} of their own distinct ethnicity." [...] (17) Others, such as Denise Chavez (Face of an Angel,1994) support Olmos' position.

[...] In general, Amy Barrias' analyses of representative coming-of-age Chicano and American Indian texts, including Bless Me, Ultima allows her to conclude that because American Indian and Chicano(a) writers find very little in dominant culture on which to build an identity, they have turned inward to create their own texts of rediscovery.

2500|$|In the United States, {{there was}} a {{movement}} to resettle free-born blacks and freed slaves who faced racial discrimination {{in the form of}} political disenfranchisement, and the denial of civil, religious and social privileges in the United States. [...] Most whites and later a small cadre of black nationalists believed that blacks would face better chances for freedom in Africa than in the U.S. The American Colonization Society was founded in 1816 in Washington, DC for this purpose, by a group of prominent politicians and slaveholders. But its membership grew to include mostly people who supported abolition of slavery. Slaveholders wanted to get free people of color out of the South, where they were thought to threaten the stability of the slave societies. Some abolitionists collaborated on relocation of free blacks, as they were discouraged by racial discrimination against them in the North and believed they would never be accepted in <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b> Most blacks, who were native-born by this time, wanted to work toward justice in the United States rather than emigrate.
