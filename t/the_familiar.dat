The series consists of 4 books, published between 2010 and 2013 by HarperCollins. As of 2017, Adam Jay Epstein stated that the series is on hiatus but is working on another project to be released in 2018.|$|R

5|$|McMullin's {{coaching}} success disappeared {{with the}} Lions {{as the team}} dropped its first five games in 1948 and finished with a 2–10 record.

5|$|Some fireflies of {{the genus}} Photuris mimic the {{flashing}} of female Photinus species to attract males of that species, which are then captured and devoured. The colors of emitted light vary from dull blue (Orfelia fultoni, Mycetophilidae) to <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> greens and the rare reds (Phrixothrix tiemanni, Phengodidae).|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of archaea into species is also controversial. Biology defines a species {{as a group}} of related organisms. <b>The</b> <b>familiar</b> exclusive breeding criterion (organisms that can breed with each other but not with others) is of no help here because archaea reproduce asexually.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>familiar</b> Pauling {{electronegativity}} scale relies upon {{chemical bond}} energies, but such values have obviously not been measured for inert helium and neon.

50|$|Guided by the {{footsteps}} {{of his father and}} <b>the</b> clues, <b>the</b> <b>familiars</b> face many dangers before arriving at their destination - the place where the Snow Leopard's crown lies. They found out that the crown is really a circle formed by seven ancient stones, each of which speaks the name of an animal upon contact. In order to summon the shifting fortress, <b>the</b> <b>familiars</b> have to bring the seven animals together. Then they find out Malvern is a traitor working for Paksahara. Malvern had drowned Aldwyn's mother and tricked his father, Baxley, into dying. Malvern was killed by a blast from Paksahara when she tried to shoot Aldwyn but missed instead. The book ends with <b>the</b> <b>familiars,</b> with <b>the</b> hired help of the bounty hunter Grimslade, prepare to seek out the seven animals, as Paksahara's Dead Army begins their invasion on Vastia.|$|R

5|$|According to legend, the Christian apostle and martyr Saint Andrew, {{the patron}} saint of Scotland, was crucified on an X-shaped cross. Use of <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> {{iconography}} of his martyrdom, showing the apostle bound to an X-shaped cross, first appears in the Kingdom of Scotland in 1180 during the reign of William I. It was again depicted on seals used during the late 13th century, including on one used by the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286.|$|E
5|$|Both written {{history and}} {{molecular}} genetic {{studies indicate that}} the domestic carrot has a single origin in Central Asia. Its wild ancestors probably originated in Persia (regions of which are now Iran and Afghanistan), which remains the centre of diversity for the wild carrot Daucus carota. A naturally occurring subspecies of the wild carrot was presumably bred selectively over the centuries to reduce bitterness, increase sweetness and minimise the woody core; this process produced <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> garden vegetable.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 20th century, {{developments}} in electronic media made possible the delivery of entertainment products to mass audiences across the globe. The technology enabled people to see, hear and participate in all <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> forms stories, theatre, music, dance wherever they live. The rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in data storage devices such as cassette tapes or compact discs, along with increasing miniaturisation. Computerisation and the development of barcodes also made ticketing easier, faster and global.|$|E

50|$|Heading to {{the final}} glyph stone outside of Bronzhaven, <b>the</b> <b>familiars</b> and <b>the</b> seven animals needed to summon the Shifting Fortress {{encounter}} a brutal battle between Paksahara's zombie forces and Queen Loranella's troops.

5|$|Due to its perception-altering effects, {{the onset}} of {{narcosis}} {{may be hard to}} recognize. At its most benign, narcosis results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and mastery of the environment. These effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide. They also resemble (though not as closely) the effects of alcohol or cannabis and <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and alprazolam. Such effects are not harmful unless they cause some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed. Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same at a given depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{to end the}} impasse, Shackleton agreed, in {{a letter}} to Scott dated 17 May 1907, to work to the east of the 170°W {{meridian}} and therefore to avoid all <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> Discovery ground. In the end it was a promise that he was unable to keep after his search for alternative landing grounds proved fruitless. With his only other option being to return home, he set up his headquarters at Cape Royds, close to the old Discovery base. For this he was roundly condemned by the British polar establishment at the time.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{atmosphere}} {{has multiple}} jet streams, {{caused by the}} convection cells that form <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> banded color structure; on Jupiter, these convection cells are driven by internal heating. The factors that control the number of jet streams in a planetary atmosphere is an active area of research in dynamical meteorology. In models, as one increases the planetary radius, holding all other parameters fixed, the number of jet streams decreases.|$|E
50|$|Human {{magic in}} Vastia is still gone, and as <b>the</b> <b>familiars</b> begin their journey {{to find the}} seven animals needed to summon the Shifting Fortress, an army of the Dead besieges the city of Bridgetower, {{destroying}} {{the first of three}} glyph stones, the only places where the Shifting Fortress can be called from. They escape, but are forced to leave the bounty hunter, Grimslade, behind. <b>The</b> <b>familiars</b> retain <b>the</b> map he made to find the animals, however, and use it to start their journey, leaving their loyals, Jack, Marianne, and Dalton, in the cellar of Stone Runlet to keep them safe.|$|R
50|$|Aldwyn discovers he has {{inherited}} his mother's telepathic {{powers as}} he and Skylar struggle to find the real Gilbert, and he uses this power to determine which frog is Gilbert, giving Skylar the opportunity to kill Paksahara. <b>The</b> <b>familiars</b> release human magic back into Vastia, which helps turn the tide of the battle raging outside Bronzhaven, resulting {{in the success of}} Loranella's army. However, Paksahara is brought back to life by the spell she used to summon <b>the</b> Dead. <b>The</b> <b>familiars</b> vanquish her once more by throwing her to the vultures that swarm above the battleground, who destroy her carcass.|$|R

5|$|Reviewers {{asserted}} that the film's music mainly lifted {{to the success of}} Bandslam from reviews, especially the ska version of Everything I Own, that the film is full of unexpected pleasures set to a surprisingly retro soundtrack. Similarly, Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter emphasized the effect of the film's music-driven comedy set against the backdrop of a high school battle of the bands competition which manages {{to come up with a}} fresh backbeat for <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> alienated teen refrain, boosted by a talented cast and authentic soundtrack.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>familiars</b> {{shook their}} heads; her wildness corroborated the assertions of Don Ambrosio, and his {{apparent}} rank commanded respect and belief. They relinquished their charge to him, {{and he was}} consigning the struggling Inez to his creatures.|$|R
