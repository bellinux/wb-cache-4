5|$|Another {{instance}} of population control is {{the prevalence of}} female infanticide. People in rural areas practiced female infanticide and selective neglect due to a preference of sons over daughters. Since the 1980s, roughly 200,000 female infants would be killed per {{year because of the}} preference for male children and the advancement in technologies such as ultrasound, which help <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> sex of the fetus. In addition to female infanticide, girls are being unregistered or are abandoned by their families, which stops them from receiving education and legal benefits the government offered. These methods of controlling population have resulted in a huge gender gap in China.|$|E
5|$|In mid-December 1982 {{the author}} and future Holocaust denier David Irving was also {{involved}} in tracking the existence of diaries written by Hitler. Priesack had previously told Irving {{of the existence of}} one of the diaries with a collector in Stuttgart. In a visit to Priesack to assess his collection of Nazi documents, Irving found out Stiefel's phone number, from which he worked out the address; he also obtained photocopies of some of the diary pages from Priesack. Irving visited Stiefel unannounced and tried <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> name of the source, but the collector misled him as to the origin. Irving examined Priesack's photocopies and saw a number of problems, including spelling mistakes and the change in writing style between certain words.|$|E

5|$|John Appleyard had profited {{in terms}} of offices and annuities from his brother-in-law's rise ever since 1559; he was {{nevertheless}} disappointed with what he had got from Robert Dudley, now Earl of Leicester. In 1567 he was approached, apparently {{on behalf of the}} Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Sussex, to accuse Leicester of the murder of his wife for a reward of £1,000 in cash. He refused to cooperate in the plot, although he had, he said, {{in the last few years}} come to believe that his half-sister was murdered. He had always been convinced of Dudley's innocence but thought it would be an easy matter <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> real culprits. He said he had repeatedly asked for the Earl's help to this effect, claiming the jury had not yet come up with their verdict; Dudley had always answered that the matter should rest, since a jury had found that there was no murder, by due procedure of law. Now, as Leicester became aware of a plot against him, he summoned Appleyard and sent him away after a furious confrontation.|$|E
