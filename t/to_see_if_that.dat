5|$|The Mew Mews {{are young}} {{girls who have}} been {{injected}} with the genes of endangered species, giving them the ability to transform into Mew Mews. The project chose endangered species because they felt that these species would have the strongest desire to preserve their kind. These superheroes are biological weapons tasked with fighting the chimera anima, the monsters created when alien parasites infect a living host. They are later called on to fight the aliens that were {{the source of the}} Chimera Anima invasion. The creation of the first five Mew Mews occurred accidentally. The head of the project, Ryô Shirogane, originally intended to inject a Chimera Anima with the endangered animal genes directly <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> would reverse the effects of the infection. Instead, it was accidentally injected into five different girls when the earthquake happened.|$|E

The ship's three flight decks were judged too small to handle the larger and heavier aircraft then coming into service. As a result, the middle and lower flight decks were eliminated in favor of two enclosed hangar decks that extended almost {{the full length of}} the ship. The upper and middle hangar areas' total space increased to about the lower hangar remained the same size. The upper flight deck was extended to the bow, increasing its length to [...] and raising aircraft capacity to 86 (61 operational and 25 in storage). A third elevator midships, [...] in size, was added. Her arrester gear was replaced by a Japanese-designed, hydraulic, Type 1 system with 9 wires. The modernization added an island superstructure on the port side of the ship, which was an unusual arrangement; the only other carrier to share this feature was a contemporary, the [...] The port side was chosen as an experiment <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> side was better for flight operations by moving the island away from the ship's exhaust outlets.

He felt that the federal Labour MPs were unable and unwilling to change society, and their prominence within the movement was stifling and over-shadowing organised labour.
