5|$|After his {{accession}} {{to the throne}} in 1820, King GeorgeIV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home.

The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by GeorgeIV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of GeorgeIV in 1830, his younger brother King WilliamIV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. After the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament.|$|E

Valve also released a software development kit, enabling developers <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> <b>the</b> game and create mods.
