While the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs possesses the ultimate authority to approve an organization's application, this appears to be largely pro forma.

500|$|Even {{before the}} library was built, members of the Eagle's Nest Art Colony were pushing for the new {{building}} to include a second-story art gallery.

Later in Carnegie's philanthropy his secretary James Bertram laid out strict requirements, including requirements which discouraged multiple uses for Carnegie libraries. Another requirement stipulated that Bertram approve library plans prior <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>approval</b> or construction.

Legalization of Sich Sharpshooters gave impetus to other Ukrainian youth organizations, and the ranks of Sich, Sokil and Plast subsequently swelled up all across Western Ukraine.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} the timing of a monopolistic firm’s product innovation and regulatory approval, and proposes a signaling model with endogenous regulatory delay. Regulatory delay exerts a multiplier effect on total time to market, because when the firm expects the regulator to take longer <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>approval,</b> the firm delays its product introduction. The firm can time its innovation to communicate its private information about the marginal cost of delay to the regulator. Successful signaling in the separating equilibrium leads the regulator to reduce regulatory delay. The implications of the model are consistent with data on innovation and regulatory delay in telecommunications markets in a few Midwest states in the U. S...|$|R
