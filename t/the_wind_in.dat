5|$|In retirement, deHavilland has {{remained}} {{active in the}} film community. In 1998, she traveled to New York to help promote a special showing of Gone with <b>the</b> <b>Wind.</b> <b>In</b> 2003, she appeared as a presenter at the 75th Academy Awards. In 2004, Turner Classic Movies produced a retrospective piece called Melanie Remembers {{in which she was}} interviewed for the 65th anniversary of the original release of Gone with <b>the</b> <b>Wind.</b> <b>In</b> June 2006, she made appearances at tributes commemorating her 90th birthday at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.|$|E
5|$|A {{problem with}} early bombsights {{was that they}} could only correct {{for the effects of}} <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> a simple way and {{required}} the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind from the target, to minimise the complexity of the required calculations. This made it difficult to attack moving targets and allowed anti-aircraft artillery to sight their weapons along the wind line.|$|E
5|$|Between 1991 and 1995, Bathurst also {{appeared}} {{on television in}} No Job for a Lady, The House of Eliott and The Detectives and on stage in The Choice, George Bernard Shaw's Getting Married at Chichester with Dorothy Tutin and Gogol's The Nose adapted by Alastair Beaton, which played in Nottingham and Bucharest. He also filmed a role in <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> the Willows (Terry Jones, 1996) as St John Weasel.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} morning of February24, a house caught fire and the flames were spread to other {{buildings}} by <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b> <b>In</b> two hours, most of Holmden Street, and parts of Brown and Second Streets, were reduced to smoldering ashes. The worst of multiple fires occurred on August 2, burning down several city blocks and destroying 27wells.|$|E
5|$|Into the 1990s, Bathurst gained wider {{recognition}} from television audiences, first as writer Mark Taylor in Joking Apart from 1993 to 1995, then as David Marsden in Cold Feet from 1998 to 2003. The decade also saw him {{appear in the}} television series The House of Eliott, The Detectives, and Hornblower, and the films Twenty-One (1991) and Terry Jones's <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> the Willows (1996).|$|E
5|$|On television, the American Broadcasting Company aired it for {{the first}} time right after its 1979 re-release. The first U.S. {{broadcast}} attracted 57 percent of the total audience, the second highest televised movie share at the time behind Gone with <b>the</b> <b>Wind.</b> <b>In</b> the United Kingdom, 23 million people watched its inaugural broadcast in October 1981, the second biggest TV audience ever for a feature film behind Live and Let Die.|$|E

5|$|Pratchett's {{earliest}} inspirations were <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> the Willows by Kenneth Grahame, and {{the works}} of Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke.

5|$|The {{only major}} {{measurement}} {{that could not}} be made automatically or before the mission was the determination of the windspeed and direction. These change over time, and also due to changes in location, altitude, or wind shear. This demanded an accurate determination of <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> the general area of the target, and would normally be highly inaccurate if dialled in at the mission start. Taking this measurement while nearing the target was an important procedure on the CSBS; its manual included several methods of determining <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b> <b>In</b> the case of the Mk. XIV, the manual described only one method of determining the wind, equivalent to the most complex of the procedures from the CSBS model.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Scottsdale, Arizona, Stone began acting as a child, in a theater {{production}} of <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> the Willows in 2000. As a teenager, she relocated to Los Angeles with her mother, and made her television debut in VH1's In Search of the New Partridge Family (2004), a reality show that produced only an unsold pilot. After small television roles, she won a Young Hollywood Award for her film debut in Superbad (2007), and received positive media attention {{for her role in}} Zombieland (2009). The 2010 teen comedy Easy A was Stone's first starring role and earned her nominations for the BAFTA Rising Star Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. This breakthrough was followed with further success in the romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love and the drama The Help (both 2011).|$|E

5|$|Stone {{was drawn}} to acting {{from the age of}} four; she wanted a career in sketch comedy initially, but shifted her focus toward musical theater, and took voice lessons for several years. Her acting debut, at the age of 11, came in a stage {{production}} of <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> the Willows, playing the part of Otter. The actress was homeschooled for two years, during which time she appeared in sixteen productions at Phoenix's Valley Youth Theatre—including The Princess and the Pea, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat—and performed with the theater's improvisational comedy troupe. Around this time, she traveled to Los Angeles and auditioned unsuccessfully for a role in Nickelodeon's All That. Her parents later sent her for private acting lessons with a local acting coach, who had worked at the William Morris Agency in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The All Blacks played Glamorgan in Swansea on 21 December. The All Blacks had the {{advantage}} of <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> the first 30 minutes. Late in the first half Roberts worked a move from a scrum to pass to Smith, who passed to Harold Abbott. Abbott then passed back to Smith who scored in the corner. In the second half Glamorgan attacked but could not score, and late in the game the All Blacks scored tries to McDonald and Wallace to win 9–0.|$|E
5|$|The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is {{the debut}} studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, {{and the only}} one made under {{founding}} member Syd Barrett's leadership. The album, named after the title of chapter seven of Kenneth Grahame's <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> the Willows and featuring a kaleidoscopic cover photo of the band taken by Vic Singh, was recorded from February to May 1967 and released on 5 August 1967. It was produced by Beatles engineer Norman Smith and released in 1967 by EMI Columbia in the United Kingdom and Tower in the United States, in August and October respectively.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} April 1947, Hordern {{accepted}} the small part of Captain Hoyle in Richard Llewellyn's comic drama film Noose. Two other roles occurred that year: as Maxim de Winter in a television adaption of Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca, followed by {{the part of a}} detective in Good-Time Girl, alongside Dennis Price and Jean Kent. The following year he took part in three plays: Peter Ustinov's The Indifferent Shepherd, which appeared at the newly opened Q Theatre in Brentford, West London; Ibsen's Ghosts; and an adaptation of <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> the Willows at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon in which he portrayed the part of the blustery, eccentric Mr Toad.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century, access to Padstow's harbour was via a narrow channel between the Doom Bar and the cliffs at Stepper Point, a {{difficult}} passage for sailing ships to navigate especially in north-westerly gales when the cliffs would {{cut off the}} wind. Many ships were wrecked on the Doom Bar, despite the installation of mooring rings and capstans on the cliffs and quarrying away part of Stepper Point to improve <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b> <b>In</b> {{the early twentieth century}} the main channel moved away from the cliffs, and continued dredging has made it much safer for boats, but deaths have occurred on the bar as recently as 1997.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00 on 12 November Amazone and Elisa sailed from Le Havre {{to unite}} {{with the force}} at Cherbourg, hoping to evade the {{blockade}} in the darkness. They successfully passed the patrolling Diana and Niobe but were spotted sailing northwest at 00:30 by the British ships which gave chase, Niobe turning inshore {{in an attempt to}} cut off the French line of advance. With <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> the northeast, the French frigates were unable to pass Cape Barfleur under pursuit, and Rosseau instead turned his squadron towards the Iles Saint-Marcouf at 04:00, using superior local knowledge to bypass the pursuing British ships. The heavily fortified islands had been under British control during the French Revolutionary Wars, but reverted to the French at the Peace of Amiens in 1802. Diana and Niobe attempted to intercept the French frigates before they came under the shelter of the guns, but were only able to fire two long-distance broadsides at the trailing Elisa.|$|E

5|$|Born in 1933 in Anderson, Indiana, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor {{was raised}} in Indiana and Illinois in the 1930s during the Great Depression. During her {{childhood}} she was hardly given any toys. Instead, with her parents reading to her every night, books formed {{a major part of}} her early years—"the happiest part". Her parents read a variety of literature to her, including Bible stories, <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> the Willows, and Mark Twain's novels, until she was 14. After she became a parent, she read to her children in the mornings because of their evening activities. At 16, Naylor wrote a short story for a church magazine, and in her early thirties she published her first book. She has published over 100 books. When she wrote and published Shiloh, her 65th novel, she was living in Bethesda, Maryland with her husband Rex, a speech pathologist whom she married in May 1960. She has two adult sons and four grandchildren.|$|E
5|$|Born in Bunkyō Ward of Tokyo, Miyazaki {{expressed}} interest in manga and animation from an early age, and he joined Toei Animation in 1963. During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with director Isao Takahata. Notable films to which Miyazaki contributed at Toei include Doggie March and Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon. He provided key animation to other films at Toei, such as Puss in Boots and Animal Treasure Island, before moving to A-Pro in 1971, where he co-directed Lupin the Third Part I alongside Takahata. After moving to Zuiyō Eizō (later known as Nippon Animation) in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece Theater, and directed the television series Future Boy Conan. He joined Telecom Animation Film in 1979 to direct his first feature films, The Castle of Cagliostro in 1979 and Nausicaä of the Valley of <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> 1984, {{as well as the}} television series Sherlock Hound.|$|E
5|$|Delta caused {{considerable}} {{damage in the}} Canary Islands. The storm claimed nineteen lives and caused a total of €312million ($364million 2005 US dollars) damage throughout the archipelago. Eighteen died when a boat sank off the Canary Islands; twelve of the bodies were never found. The nineteenth man was killed when while trying to repair his roof during the storm; winds threw him from his ladder. The islands of Tenerife and La Palma were hardest hit, with many uprooted trees and landslides reported. The peak gust recorded at La Palma was 95mph (152km/h), and at Tenerife the maximum gust was 90mph (147km/h). Some patients at Tenerife's University Hospital were evacuated to a safer {{part of the building}} when paneling from the hospital's heliport was torn free and smashed some of the building's windows. Off Santa Cruz's southern quay a tug boat broke its ties, collided with another vessel, and sank. Passengers at Tenerife North Airport, who were stranded when their flights canceled, witnessed parts of the new international terminal's roof tear off in <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b> <b>In</b> La Palma a falling palm tree, trunk snapped by the wind, injured the leg of a German tourist. Many palm trees along the Avenida Marítima were also blown down. The storms winds blew out windows and collapsed cornices, although other structural damage was minimal. Metal plates that had been used to board up buildings were strewn all over the island.|$|E
