500|$|While Mr. Eko {{was created}} as a more passive character, the idea changed when the {{producers}} first saw Akinnuoye-Agbaje play the character. Akinnuoye-Agbaje explained: [...] "once they saw me on the screen without a shirt, all 6 foot 2 and using a stick beating <b>three</b> <b>guys</b> up, they knew this guy wasn't {{going to be just}} a passive priest". Eventually, Cuse and Lindelof decided to combine their original idea for the character with Akinnuoye-Agbaje's character on Oz. Originally, the character was named [...] "Emeka", and later [...] "Omecca", but after Akinnuoye-Agbaje was cast, the name was changed to [...] "Eko", in order to be consistent with Akinnuoye-Agbaje's own Nigerian tribal lineage. Eko refers to the City of Legos (Lagos) in Nigeria, coming from Eleko, Lord of Lagos. Adding [...] "Mr." [...] in front of the character's name was also a suggestion made by Akinnuoye-Agbaje. While at first Cuse and Lindelof thought this was [...] "the silliest thing in the world", they changed their minds after repeating the name a few times, realizing there [...] "was something really cool about it". The character first appeared in [...] "Adrift", where he was only shown briefly, knocking down three of the show's main characters with a stick. Akinnuoye-Agbaje was given the stick and told to [...] "knock those <b>three</b> <b>guys</b> out". Akinnuoye-Agbaje felt [...] "there's no better way to make an entrance". The religious scripture on the stick was a suggestion of Akinnuoye-Agbaje.|$|E

500|$|The {{scripting}} of the film, tentatively titled as Running {{with the}} Bulls, {{was completed in}} November 2009 {{after three months of}} work. Zoya and Kagti incorporated real life observations, and specially wrote the character of Imraan for her brother Farhan Akhtar. Akhtar wrote the dialogues for the film. The theme of the film was [...] "about <b>three</b> <b>guys</b> on the verge of making commitments in life", according to him. They used Javed Akhtar's poetry as a voice-over because they felt the poetry adds depth to the character and lends voice to their feelings. A special poem inspired by a fan's poem was penned down for Katrina's character, after she was cast in the project. The first choice for the location of principal filming was Mexico, but was later changed to Spain since the climax features running with the bulls and Zoya wanted a country that blended history, culture and sports. The release date of the film was rescheduled thrice because the originally selected editor, Chandan Arora, fell ill and they had to redo the editing.|$|E

The sessions were problematic, with minor disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order decided {{on the eve of}} the event. At the beginning of their performance of [...] "Wish You Were Here", Waters told the audience: [...] " [...] quite emotional, standing up here with these <b>three</b> <b>guys</b> after all these years, standing to be counted with the rest of you... we're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd." [...] At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage. Waters then called him back, and the band shared a group hug. Images of that hug were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8. Waters commented on their almost twenty years of animosity: [...] "I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity." ...|$|E

Before the show, a journalist angered Redding by asking why he was there; the reporter then informed him that two weeks earlier Hendrix announced that he had been replaced with Billy Cox. The next day, Redding quit the Experience and returned to London. He announced that he had left the band and intended to pursue a solo career, blaming Hendrix's plans to expand the group without allowing for his input as a primary reason for leaving. Redding later commented: [...] "Mitch and I hung out a lot together, but we're English. If we'd go out, Jimi would stay in his room. But any bad feelings came from us being <b>three</b> <b>guys</b> who were traveling too hard, getting too tired, and taking too many drugs... I liked Hendrix. I don't like Mitchell." ...|$|E
