40|$|AbstractRepresentation of Romania at <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Council's</b> {{meetings}} {{has been}} a controversial issue, a subject of reflection for the Constitutional Court which pronounced three decisions on this matter, each of them expressing distinct opinions. Romania's representation at <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Council's</b> meetings has become a topic of great interest {{with the onset of}} a constitutional legal conflict between the President and the Prime Minister. This conflict occurred in the summer of 2012, when it raised the issue of who would represent Romania at <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Council's</b> meeting on June 28 - 29 th of the same year. The Constitutional Court has pronounced two decisions on the matter - Decision no. 683 / 2012 and Decision no. 784 / 2012 -, which provide “in the exercise of his attributions, The President of Romania participates at <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Council's</b> meetings as head of state. This attribution may be delegated by the President of Romania, expressly, to the Prime Minister. In this context, the Constitutional Court was notified by the head of state with an objection of unconstitutionality of certain provisions of the Law on the Cooperation between Parliament and Government in <b>European</b> affairs. So, <b>the</b> Constitutional Court pronounced the third decision whereby it changed some aspects of its own jurisprudence on the matter. This study reveals and comments on the three decisions of the Constitutional Court and presents the opinions expressed by the doctrine on the subject under analysis.

5|$|Almost {{all members}} of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> {{are members of a}} {{political}} party at national level, and most of these are members of a European-level political party. These frequently hold pre-meetings of their European Council members, prior to its meetings.

5|$|However, under Barroso, the Commission {{began to}} lose ground to the larger member states as {{countries}} such as France, the UK and Germany sought to sideline its role.

There has also been a greater degree of politicisation within the Commission.|$|E
