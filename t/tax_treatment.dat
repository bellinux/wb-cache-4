In its election campaign, the CCF did not promise to nationalize any industries. It promised changes in the tax code in order to increase the redistribution of wealth in Canada. It pledged to increase exemptions from income tax, to allow medical expenses to be considered deductions from income for tax purposes, and to eliminate sales tax on food, clothing, and other necessities of life.

40|$|Economists {{have rarely}} {{considered}} {{the implications of}} taxation systems for the agricultural sector. Management specialists and accountants have usually approached the issue {{from the perspective of}} how farmers and landowners can avoid it. Little has been written {{on the extent to which}} the special treatments that agriculture commonly receives in national tax systems impact on the sector and its performance. This paper considers these broader issues and builds on an inventory of <b>tax</b> <b>treatments</b> compiled for the OECD by one of the authors. Tax concessions can act as forms of support to incomes and wealth accumulation, though the identification and quantification of this support present fundamental conceptual difficulties and practical problems. Taxes are often advocated as instruments of environmental policy, and these may have income implications. Concessions given by capital taxes, in particular, constrain structural adjustment. Differential <b>tax</b> <b>treatments</b> can also impact on patterns of international trade by distorting comparative advantage, as perceived by farm operators. Some of these effects are of major importance to agricultural adjustment and to policy.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} different international accounting and <b>tax</b> <b>treatments</b> for goodwill on targets shareholders' wealth. The evidence shows that foreign companies that write off goodwill against a reserve account transfer more wealth to the target shareholders than those that amortize goodwill against income. Further analysis reveals that foreign acquires that deduct goodwill for tax purposes transfer more wealth to the target stockholders at the acquisition announcement than other acquires. Such wealth transfers are precipitated by the competition for corporate control. Thus, the more advantageous international accounting and <b>tax</b> <b>treatments</b> for goodwill may leave U. S. bidders at a disadvantage as they compete with foreign acquirers for corporate control. Furthermore, contrary to the multinational network hypothesis, the study shows that for the firms in the sample, the acquirers with previous experience in the U.

On the other hand, {{the results for the}} relationship between industrial relatedness of merger partners and abnormal returns to target shareholders is mixed. Â© 1995 JIBS.

25|$|There is {{dispute about}} the level of {{subsidies}} paid to the fossil fuel industry in Australia. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) argues that according to the definitions of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), fossil fuel production and use is subsidised in Australia by means of direct payments, favourable <b>tax</b> <b>treatment,</b> and other actions. It is suggested these measures act as impediments to investment in renewable energy resources. Analysis by the ACF indicates that these provisions add up to a total annual subsidy of A$7.7billion, with the most significant component being the Fuel Tax Credits program that rebates diesel fuel excise to many business users. This analysis is disputed by the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) who argue that the ACF's definition of a subsidy differs from that of the OECD and that the fuel tax rebate schemes are in place to ensure that all producers are treated equally from a tax point of view. However, the IPA acknowledges that regardless of perceived issues with the ACF analysis, some level of fossil fuel subsidy is likely in existence.|$|E

500|$|The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") took {{public action}} in 2005. [...] In mid year, it {{released}} two private letter rulings, {{each of which}} described an organization that was conducting operations {{in a manner similar}} to the Nehemiah Program. [...] Each ruling found that (i) the organization's operations did not exclusively serve a charitable purpose but, instead, served to promote [...] "the private interests of home sellers and other private parties" [...] and, consequently, (ii) the payments made by home sellers to the organization would not qualify as [...] "charitable contributions" [...] for which the seller could claim a tax deduction. [...] And in November 2005, the Department of Justice filed suit in Chicago on behalf of the IRS, seeking an injunction against an Illinois-based seller-funded down-payment program. [...] The injunction sought to bar that program from [...] "falsely advising" [...] home sellers that they could claim their payments to the program as charitable-contribution tax deductions. [...] The IRS made its findings applicable to all seller-funded down-payment assistance programs when it issued a revenue ruling in May 2006. [...] That ruling, Revenue Ruling 2006â€“27, contrasted the <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of seller-funded programs with the treatment accorded to other types of down-payment assistance. [...] Seller-funded programs, the ruling stated, were [...] "not operated exclusively for charitable purposes". [...] Furthermore, payments made by the seller to the organizations were to be treated not as charitable contributions, but either as rebates to the home buyer or as reductions in the sales price of the home. [...] Shortly after the revenue ruling was issued, Nehemiah published an open letter from its president, in which it noted its opposition to the ruling but added that the ruling did not prevent the Nehemiah Program from continuing its operations. The letter did note, however, that Nehemiah might have to pay [...] "appropriate business taxes on the revenue generated by its downpayment assistance program".|$|E

The empirical analysis is based on data of German multinationals. The data is taken from the MiDi database provided by the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank). Regarding the <b>tax</b> loss <b>treatment</b> of potential future losses, our regression results suggest that a short carryforward time limit lowers investments in industries having a high probability to make losses. Moreover, we find significant positive effects of group loss offsetting provisions on the size of investments and on the number of subsidiaries they are structured across. Concerning the effects of existing losses carried forward, we find a reduced tax rate elasticity of investments for companies shielded by existing losses...|$|R
