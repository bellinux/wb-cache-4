5|$|Each volcano type {{produced}} by the Anahim hotspot has its own unique life cycle of growth and erosion. Volcanic cones have their origins from tephra accumulating around vents during Strombolian eruptions. They are composed of trachyte, <b>trachyandesite,</b> basalt, phonolite, basanite {{and to a lesser}} extent phonotephrite. In contrast, lava domes are formed mainly by viscous trachytic magma that erupted effusively onto the surface and then piled up thick around vents. Most of these features were formed by a single volcanic eruption and are therefore monogenetic. However, in some cases several eruptions occurred at a single locus to create larger, polygenetic centres (e.g. Satah Mountain, Baldface Mountain, Nazko Cone). Once activity has declined, erosion reduces them into volcanic remnants such as lava plugs.|$|E
5|$|Magma {{production}} of the Anahim hotspot has shifted from more felsic to more mafic compositions in the last 3.0million years. For instance, much of the magma created between 3.0and 0.33million years ago was igneous phonolite, trachyte, <b>trachyandesite,</b> basalt and basanite; the volcanoes built during this period are almost entirely made of these rock types. Other igneous rocks such as phonotephrite are present in smaller quantities; these occur in the Satah Mountain volcanic field. Volcanic eruptions in the last 0.33million years have been mainly basanitic and have occurred at the youngest eruptive centre, Nazko Cone. Basanites produced by these eruptions are significantly more undersaturated than basalts from older Anahim volcanoes {{in the west and}} may indicate an eastward shift toward a deeper or less depleted mantle source. It is also possible that as the North American Plate moves over the Anahim hotspot, it underlies thinner continental crust. The overall chemistry and mineralogy of the Anahim magmas are analogous to regions of incipient continental rifting above a mantle plume.|$|E

40|$|Volcanic {{rocks of}} the Afyon {{province}} (eastern part of western Anatolia) {{make up a}} multistage potassic and ultrapotassic alkaline series dated from 14 to 12 Ma. The early-stage Si-oversaturated volcanic rocks around the Afyon city and further southward are trachyandesitic volcanic activity (14. 23 ± 0. 09 Ma). Late-stage Si-undersaturated volcanism in the southernmost part of the Afyon volcanic province took place in three episodes inferred from their stratigraphic relationships and ages. Melilite– leucitites (11. 50 ± 0. 03 Ma), spotted rachyandesites, tephryphonolites and lamproites (11. 91 ± 0. 13 Ma) formed in the first episode; <b>trachyandesites</b> in the second episode and finally phonotephrites, phonolite, basaltic <b>trachyandesites</b> and nosean-bearing <b>trachyandesites</b> during the last episode. The parameter Q [normative q-(ne + lc + kls + ol) ] of western Anatolia volcanism clearly decreased southward with time becoming zero in the time interval 10 – 15 Ma. The magmatism experienced a sudden change in the extent of Si saturation after 14 Ma, during late-stage volcanic activity of Afyon volcanic province at around 12 Ma, though there was some coexistence of Si-oversaturated and Si-undersaturated magmas during the whole life of Afyon volcanic province...|$|R

40|$|Geochemistry of {{two groups}} of late Mesozoic {{volcanic}} rocks from the north Huaiyang belt (NHB) of the northern Dabie orogen provide evidence for their derivation from an enriched lithospheric mantle with subducted continental crustal relicts. The older group (149 - 137 Ma) consists of <b>trachyandesites</b> and trachydacites, showing light rare earth element (LREE) and large ion lithophile element (LILE) enrichment and strong high field strength element (HFSE, e. g., Nb, Ta, P and Ti) depletion, and highly enriched Sr-Nd isotopic signatures (87 Sr/ 86 Sr(i) = 0. 7082 - 0. 7098 and εNd(t) =- 24. 4 to - 19. 1). Despite variations in SiO 2, MgO and isotopic ratios, they exhibit slight change in TiO 2, P 2 O 5, Nb and LREE, suggesting that source differences rather than magmatic processes could be a major controlling factor for their genesis. The younger group (132 - 116 Ma) is mainly composed of basaltic <b>trachyandesites</b> and <b>trachyandesites,</b> having more significant LREE and LILE enrichment and HFSE depletion but less enriched Sr-Nd isotopic compositions (87 Sr/ 86 Sr(i) = 0. 7080 - 0. 7084 and εNd(t) =- 19. 2 to - 16. 2) than the older group. The time-integrated elemental and isotopic variations from groups 1 to 2 show that less continental crustal materials were involved in producing the younger group of basaltic magmas because of easy exhaustion of the crustal rocks trapped in the lithospheric mantle during generation of the older intermediate-felsic melts.

It records two main events, an older, mostly Miocene one (26 to 8 Ma) and a younger Pliocene to Holocene one (younger than 5 Ma). It covers an N-S lowland belt named here the central depression. To the North of 36 ° 20 'S, the region was described as Los Huarpes depression, a partially deformed sedimentary basin characterized by a 1000 m-thick, undifferentiated Cenozoic sequence. To the south, Upper Cretaceous to Lower Paleogene layers, instead of the undifferentiated Cenozoic deposits, are covered by basalts. The volcanism additionally covers the western side of the San Rafael Block as well as the fold and thrust belt of the Andean foothills. The Payenia province consists of more than 800 monogenetic basaltic cones, and scarce polygenetic volcanos fed by shallow magmatic chambers. Among the latter, the following examples can be mentioned: Miocene Chachahuén volcano (7 to 5 Ma), composed of andesites, rhyodacites and basalts with high-K and amphibole; Pliocene El Nevado volcano, with calc-alkaline, basaltic <b>trachyandesites,</b> trachytes, dacites and rhyolites; and Upper Pleistocene to Holocene Payún Matrú volcano, composed of trachytes, <b>trachyandesites</b> and trachybasalts. The southernmost area of the central depression is covered by the Pleistocene, Auca Mahuida basaltic shield (1. 7 to 0. 88 Ma), consisting of trachybasalts, basaltic <b>trachyandesites</b> and <b>trachyandesites.</b> This shield is aligned with Tromen and Domuyo volcanos, defining an NW-SE volcanic belt, oblique to the Andes, whose southern tip corresponds to the Cortaderas lineament. Some of the monogenetic cones are of hydromagmatic origin, whereas a few others exhibit small mantle inclusions. The Payenia retroarc province develops to the south of the Pampean flat slab segment, where the heights of the Andes are smaller. This height difference might have been caused by a higher thermal gradient that softened the crust in the steeper subduction segment, while the colder lithosphere in the flat slab segment allowed greater crustal thickening and height. From the tectonic point of view the height difference has been attributed to a smaller orogenic contraction in the southern segment. Holocene volcanism appears exclusively at Payun Matru volcano. The associated thermal anomaly may explain the segmentation of the central depression, separating the Cenozoic Los Huarpes basin in the north and the section without coeval sedimentation in the south. The only surface evidence of this segmentation is the E-W, La Carbonilla fault, running both sides of the Payun Matru volcano. Other authors have explained this thermal anomaly as a process of crustal thinning and stretching associated with hot injection from the asthenosphere...|$|R
