5|$|The North Acropolis of {{the ancient}} Maya city of Tikal in Guatemala is an {{architectural}} complex <b>that</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> royal necropolis and was a centre for funerary activity for over 1300 years. The acropolis is located near {{the centre of the}} city {{and is one of the}} most studied of Maya architectural complexes.

5|$|Business US Highway41 (Bus. US41) {{was a state}} {{trunkline}} highway <b>that</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> business loop off US41 and M-28 in Marquette, Michigan, along Washington and Front streets. The streets {{serve the}} downtown area of Marquette and are bordered by several commercial properties and businesses. Those two streets originate with the early founding {{of the city in}} the middle of the 19th century. Jurisdiction over them was transferred to the city as part of a highway swap that resulted in the decommissioning of the trunkline in 2005. It was also previously co-designated Bus. M-28, mirroring the Bus. US41/Bus. M-28 designation previously used along Bus. M-28 in Ishpeming and Negaunee. Washington and Front streets had been a part of the state highway system since the 1910s, and a part of the United States Numbered Highway System since 1926. The business loop designation dates back to the 1960s and was removed in 2005.|$|E

5|$|In February 1827, Joaquim Inácio was {{transferred}} to the crew of the corvette Duquesa de Goiás, in which he was {{to take part in the}} invasion of Carmen de Patagones, a village in the northeast of the United Provinces <b>that</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> port for corsairs. The Duquesa de Goiás sank during the expedition, killing several crew members. Joaquim Inácio insisted on being the last officer to leave the vessel. He was next given the command of the schooner Constança. The invasion of Carmen was a complete failure, and the Brazilian land forces were defeated and taken prisoner. On 7 March, while Joaquim Inácio awaited news of the invasion, the Constança and another schooner were surrounded by enemy vessels. After a desperate battle, he was taken captive after refusing to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Sauerbrunn {{joined the}} {{national}} team for a training camp {{at the end of}} August in order to prepare for two matches against Mexico in September as well as the 2014 CONCACAF Women's Qualifying tournament in October.

Sauerbrunn made three appearances in the tournament. She started for the United States in their opening match against Trinidad & Tobago on October 15, which they won 1–0.

5|$|While {{only a few}} {{artifacts}} were recovered, historians {{said the}} dig offered a clearer view of early 19th-century life at Colross. Discoveries included an underground domed brick cistern <b>that</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> water purification system and evidence that slaves lived in outbuildings on the Colross estate. Archaeologists also discovered the mansion's original basement floor, which was laid in a herringbone bond. Evidence of the estate's exterior walls, {{the foundations of the}} smokehouse, stables, and a burial vault were also unearthed. In the northwestern portion of the property, what is thought to have been the foundation of a rectangular burial vault was found. No burial remains were discovered. All interments were presumably removed in the early 20th century. Thomson Francis Mason was originally interred at the Colross graveyard in 1838, as were two of his daughters. Subsequent residents had their remains reinterred at Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery in Alexandria. According to the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership, the delay in construiction caused 79 condominium buyers to abandon their purchases.|$|E

5|$|Andrianjaka's {{fortified}} compound came to {{be known}} as the Rova of Antananarivo and constituted the heart of his newly founded city of Antananarivo. Prior to Andrianjaka's rule, Merina sovereigns shifted their capital from one town to another, but with the establishment of the rova on the peak of Analamanga hill, Antananarivo was to become the capital of the Kingdom of Imerina (and, ultimately, the 19th-century Kingdom of Madagascar) for generations of Merina sovereigns. The heart of the town was built in stages: first, the army cleared the forest covering the hill's summit and constructed the rova compound to serve as an initial garrison enclosing a traditional-style wooden house (lapa) <b>that</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> residence for the king. Soon thereafter, two more houses were constructed; Andrianjaka also designated the construction space and design for a row of royal tombs. In keeping with Merina aristocratic tradition, each structure in the compound was given a name. The row of tombs was named Fitomiandalana ("Seven Aligned Tombs"), Andrianjaka's own tomb being the first of these constructed. According to one account, the very first royal house constructed within the Rova of Antananarivo was named Besakana ("Great Breadth") and served as the personal residence of Andrianjaka. This account is contradicted by another source that states the second and third houses were called Masoandrotsiroa and Besakana, with the latter again characterized as Andrianjaka's personal residence, leaving the precise origins of Besakana unclear.|$|E

She returned to the national team for a training camp {{at the end of}} August in order to prepare for two matches against Mexico in September as well as the 2014 CONCACAF Women's Championship in October. She dressed for both games against Mexico and was subsequently named to the roster for the 2014 CONCACAF Women's Championship <b>that</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> qualification for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. This was the first CONCACAF qualifying roster that Harris made at the senior level. She made her fourth appearance for the national team in team's final group match against Haiti on October 20, 2014 in Washington, D.C. She played all 90 minutes and recorded her first career shut out in a 6–0 win for the United States. The United States {{went on to win the}} tournament after a 6–0 win over Costa Rica.

5|$|The Cabinet War Rooms is an {{underground}} complex <b>that</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> British government command centre throughout the Second World War. Located beneath the Treasury {{building in the}} Whitehall area of Westminster, the facilities became operational in 1939 and were in constant use until their abandonment in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan. Their historical value was recognised early on, and the public were able to visit by appointment. However, the practicalities of allowing public access to a site beneath a working government office meant that only 4,500 of 30–40,000 annual applicants to visit the War Rooms could be admitted. The museum agreed {{to take over the}} administration of the site in 1982, a development keenly supported by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an admirer of Britain's wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Thatcher opened the War Rooms in April 1984. In 2003 a further suite of rooms, used as accommodation by Churchill, his wife and close associates, were added to the museum. The restoration of these rooms, which since the war had been stripped out and used for storage, cost £7.5 million. In 2005 the War Rooms were rebranded as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, with 850m2 of the site redeveloped as a biographical museum exploring Churchill's life. The development of the Churchill Museum cost a further £6 million. The centrepiece is a 15m interactive table which enables visitors to access digitised material, particularly from the Churchill Archives Centre, via an 'electronic filing cabinet'. The museum was renamed the Churchill War Rooms in 2010.|$|E
