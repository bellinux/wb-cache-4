30|$|The first factor, {{geographical}} {{spread of}} the customers, is statistically significant. For clustered customers, the <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> increase with 11 % on average when allowing customers to select a delivery time window. The percentage of <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> increase is calculated by dividing the additional costs of allowing customers to choose a delivery time window by the <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> of the basic scenario. For randomly spread customers, the <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> increase with 24 % on average. When customers are clustered the increase in costs is less than when customers are randomly spread because when customers are spread more randomly probably more distance is needed to travel to another customer with a close delivery time window.|$|R

40|$|Objective. Fecal {{incontinence}} is {{a problem}} with a high prevalence. Patients generally suffer from their problems for many years. It has been shown that quality of life is negatively affected but health economic data for fecal incontinence are limited. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the costs associated with fecal incontinence in a large outpatient study group, taking a societal perspective. Material and methods. Based on questionnaire data, we calculated the costs of health-care resources, out-of-pocket expenses and costs associated with production losses in paid and unpaid work. Results. Data were available for 253 patients, of which 228 (90 %) were female and 209 (83 %) were treated in an academic medical center. The mean age of patients was 59 years (SD +/- 13) with a mean duration of incontinence of 8. 5 years (SD +/- 8. 3). <b>Total</b> <b>costs</b> were estimated on E 2169 per fecal incontinent patient per year. Production losses in paid and unpaid work accounted for more than half of the <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> and costs of health-care visits accounted for almost a fifth of <b>total</b> <b>costs.</b> Costs associated with protective material (partially reimbursable and not reimbursable) formed only one-tenth of <b>total</b> <b>costs,</b> while incontinence medication was responsible for only 5 % of <b>total</b> <b>costs.</b> Conclusions.
