5|$|The Cacchios {{expressed}} a desire to sell the Theatre to <b>the</b> <b>RTC</b> rather than to developers, because <b>the</b> <b>RTC</b> consisted of friends of the family and other residents whom the Cacchios trusted to maintain and preserve the Theatre. To make the transfer of ownership easier, the Cacchios agreed to continue operating the Theatre until such a deal could be reached, and to assist in the operation of the Theatre after its sale to <b>the</b> <b>RTC.</b> By late February 2010 <b>the</b> <b>RTC</b> had raised $45,000, and needed to reach a total of $600,000. After a down payment of $160,000, and paying the full cost of the property, the remaining funds would cover renovations to the building. Over $8,000 was raised in a silent auction on February28. More than 100 people attended the auction, including Congressman Maurice Hinchey.|$|E

Announcing its intent to show {{the same kind of}} movies that the Theatre screened during the Cacchio's tenure, the group also agreed to continue exhibiting live acts, continue participating in the Woodstock Film Festival, renovate the building, and add digital equipment. The second and third floors may be renovated and used for offices, and as space for rehearsals and performances.|$|E

Created by PepsiCo in 2010 {{as a way}} to {{distribute}} $33million that would otherwise fund its Super Bowl ads, the contest sought to provide funding for community projects. The ten projects receiving the most votes would each receive $50,000 grants. By April, <b>the</b> <b>RTC</b> was courting large institutions, such as IBM, for funding. Other planned activities designed to raise funds in April and May were a series of potlucks, a writing workshop, a music benefit, an online auction, and a screening of rare 1970s films at activist Jay Blotcher's house. Most of the RTC's funding came from individual donations between $25 and $100, and roughly 60 fundraisers were held in total.|$|E

The group considered moving to a digital projector with the forthcoming grant to replace the existing projector, an expected cost of $100,000. By late May, the group had won the April competition and was waiting for the Pepsi funds, before tendering a down payment on the Theatre, initially planned for June10.
