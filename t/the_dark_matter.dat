5|$|As the {{two worlds}} begin to merge, Dusk and Alba reveal their {{plans to go to}} the ancient {{floating}} city known as Mysidia. Once the Warriors of Light arrive and meet the Elder of Mysidia, Sophia, the Avalon Empire attempt to strike Mysidia with their airship superweapon Heliogabalus. The warriors destroy the ship with the aid of Dr. Lugae, the living doll Argy, and Barbara and her dragons. Sophia then helps the warriors gain the last remaining crystal in the World of Light within the caves of Mysidia. After gaining the crystal's ability, Mysidia falls to the ground while simultaneously the Warriors of Darkness are aided by a mysterious man known as The Mask in gaining the last crystal fragment remaining in the World of Darkness. They succeed in gaining the fragment, however The Mask dies. Before his death, he reveals himself to be Elgo's other half that formed when the world split in two and asks the Warriors of Darkness {{to take care of his}} other Half as he dies. After both parties gain the fragments, the split world merges and both parties are reunited, however most of the people in the world have disappeared. Attempting to make a frontal attack to the Avalon Empire, the warriors discover a barrier protecting Avalon and eight gates across the world, linking to a realm called the Rift. Upon entering one of the gates, the warriors encounter a dark sphere in which Sophia explains it is a substance found only in the Rift known as Dark Matter, and that Avalon's goal is to harvest it for their evil purposes. Vata explains the Avalon Empire is guarding <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> across the world with their generals, who have been revived in undead forms. After collecting all eight pieces of <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> and defeating the undead generals, <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> fuses together, creating a new crystal and revealing that the crystal split the world to protect itself from the Empire's plans. The crystal then breaks the barrier that was protecting Avalon, allowing the warriors to enter.|$|E

40|$|We study phenomenological {{aspects of}} the bino-wino co-annihilation {{scenario}} in high-scale supersymmetry breaking models. High-scale SUSY breaking scenarios {{are considered to be}} promising possibility after the discovery of the Higgs boson with a mass around 126 GeV. In this paper, we discuss the bino lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) accompanied by the at most around 30 GeV heavier wino. With the suitable mass splitting between the bino and the wino, the bino LSP has the correct relic abundance of <b>dark</b> <b>matter.</b> For <b>the</b> smaller mass splitting, the late-time decay of the gravitino can provide the correct abundance of <b>the</b> bino <b>dark</b> <b>matter.</b> It is extremely challenging to find signals from <b>the</b> bino <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> in direct and indirect detections.

25|$|Dark matter {{can refer}} to any {{substance}} which interacts predominantly via gravity with visible matter (e.g. stars and planets).

However, for the reasons outlined below, most scientists consider <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> to be dominated by a non-baryonic component, which is likely composed of a currently unknown fundamental particle (or similar exotic state).|$|E
25|$|Currently {{there has}} been no {{well-established}} claim of dark matter detection from a direct detection experiment, leading instead to strong upper limits on the mass and interaction cross section with nucleons of such dark matter particles. The DAMA/NaI and more recent DAMA/LIBRA experimental collaborations claim to have detected an annual modulation in the rate of events in their detectors, which they claim is due to dark matter. This results from the expectation that as the Earth orbits the Sun, the velocity of the detector relative to <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> halo will vary by a small amount. This claim is so far unconfirmed and in contradiction with negative results from other experiments such as LUX and SuperCDMS.|$|E

Alternatively if <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> particle is unstable, it could decay into standard model (or other) particles. These processes could be detected indirectly through an excess of gamma rays, antiprotons or positrons emanating from high density regions in our galaxy or others. A major difficulty inherent in such searches is that there are various astrophysical sources which can mimic the signal expected from dark matter, and so multiple signals will likely be required for a conclusive discovery.|$|E

40|$|Recently {{two groups}} {{independently}} observed unidentified X-ray line signal at the energy 3. 55 keV from the galaxy clusters and Andromeda galaxy. We {{show that this}} anomalous signal can be explained in annihilating <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> model, for example, fermionic <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> model in hidden sector with global U(1) _X symmetry proposed by Weinberg. There are two scenarios {{for the production of}} <b>the</b> annihilating <b>dark</b> <b>matters.</b> In <b>the</b> first scenario <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matters</b> with mass 3. 55 keV decouple from the interaction with Goldstone bosons and go out of thermal equilibrium at high temperature (> 1 TeV) when they are still relativistic, their number density per comoving volume being essentially fixed to be the current value. The correct relic abundance of this warm <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> is obtained by assuming that about O(10 ^ 3) relativistic degrees of freedom were present at the decoupling temperature or alternatively large entropy production occurred at high temperature. In the other scenario, <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matters</b> were absent at high temperature, and as the universe cools down, the SM particles annihilate or decay to produce <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matters</b> non-thermally as in `freeze-in' scenario. It turns out that the DM production from Higgs decay is the dominant one. In the model we considered, only the first scenario can explain both X-ray signal and relic abundance. The X-ray signal arises through p-wave annihilation of <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> pair into two photons through the scalar resonance without violating the constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave background, and astrophysical objects such as red giants or white dwarfs.

25|$|Baryon {{acoustic}} oscillations (BAO) are regular, {{periodic fluctuations}} in {{the density of the}} visible baryonic matter (normal matter) of the universe. These are predicted to arise in the Lambda-CDM model due to the early universe's acoustic oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid and can be observed in the cosmic microwave background angular power spectrum. BAOs set up a preferred length scale for baryons. As <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> and baryons clumped together after recombination, the effect is much weaker in the galaxy distribution in the nearby universe, but is detectable as a subtle (~ 1 percent) preference for pairs of galaxies to be separated by 147 Mpc, compared to those separated by 130 or 160 Mpc. This feature was predicted theoretically in the 1990s and then discovered in 2005, in two large galaxy redshift surveys, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. Combining the CMB observations with BAO measurements from galaxy redshift surveys provides a precise estimate of the Hubble constant and the average matter density in the Universe.
