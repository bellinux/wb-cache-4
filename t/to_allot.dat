5|$|For {{most of the}} 18th century, the Oklahoma {{region was}} under nominal French control as Louisiana. The limited {{interaction}} between the peoples was based on fur trading. In 1803, the Louisiana Purchase by Thomas Jefferson brought the area under United States control. In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which removed American Indian tribes from the Southeast and relocated them to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. The southern part of this territory was originally assigned to the Choctaw and Chickasaw. In 1867, the United States used the Medicine Lodge Treaty <b>to</b> <b>allot</b> the southwest portion of the Choctaw and Chickasaw’s lands to the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache tribes.|$|E
5|$|Padayappas initial {{final cut}} lasted for 22 reels, which was {{considered}} too lengthy. Rather than cut the film, Rajinikanth suggested to Ravikumar <b>to</b> <b>allot</b> two intervals for the film. Ravikumar was wary of this idea, {{and went to}} actor Kamal Haasan for advice, since the initial final cut of Haasan's Nayakan (1987) was also 22 reels. Using his prior experience on trimming Nayakan, Haasan was able to cut Padayappa down to 16 reels. When Kumudams reporter Kannan asked Rajinikanth to release the scenes which had been cut as Padayappas sequel, Rajinikanth immediately spoke to Ravikumar about the possibility, but was informed that those reels had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Sato {{estimated}} the game's budget at US$3–5 million. He {{said that the}} development team intended to make Silent Hill a masterpiece rather than a traditional sales-oriented game, and that they opted for an engaging story, which would persist over time – similar to successful literature. The game debuted at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, where the presentations of movies and in-game scenes garnered applause from the audience. This favorable reception persuaded Konami <b>to</b> <b>allot</b> more personnel and public relation initiatives to the project. Konami later showcased Silent Hill at the European Computer Trade Show in London, and included a demo with its stealth game Metal Gear Solid in Japan.|$|E

5|$|Gemini was {{formally}} launched on 21 November 2001 at the Hotel Connemara, Chennai {{in the presence}} of celebrities including Rajinikanth (through video conferencing) and Kamal Haasan. The launch function was marked by the submission of the script, songs and lyrics. Principal photography was scheduled to begin in mid-December that year, but commenced slightly earlier. Vikram shot for the film simultaneously with Samurai (2002). When Kalabhavan Mani was hesitant in accepting the film due to other commitments in Malayalam, shooting was re-scheduled to film his scenes first. Saran persuaded Mani <b>to</b> <b>allot</b> dates for twelve days to complete his scenes. Since Mani was a mimicry artist, Saran asked him to exhibit his talents; Mani aped the behaviour of a few animals and Saran chose among them, which were added to the film.|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{was left}} to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of {{thousands}} of veterans of the Macedonian campaign, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land. There was no more government-controlled land <b>to</b> <b>allot</b> as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former. There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.|$|E
5|$|In India, the Hindi {{version of}} Ra.One was {{released}} across more than 4,000 plus screens worldwide- 3,100 screens in 2,100 theatres, breaking {{the record for}} the widest Bollywood release previously held by Bodyguard (2011). The Tamil and Telugu versions were released on 275 prints and 125 prints respectively. A week before the release, multiplex owners throughout India decided <b>to</b> <b>allot</b> 95% of the total available screen space to the film. Overseas, Ra.One was released in 904 prints. This including 600 prints in Germany, 344 prints in the USA, 200–300 prints in South Korea, 202 prints in the UK, 79 prints in the Middle East, 75 prints in Russia, 51 prints in Australia, 49 prints in Canada and 25 prints in New Zealand and Taiwan. In early October 2011, a partnership deal was being finalised by the distributors to allow the film to be released in China across 1,000 prints. In addition, the film was released in Pakistan and non-traditional territories like Brazil, Spain, Italy, Greece and Hong Kong. The 3D version was released in 550 screens across the world. Ra.One was noted for the extensive use of digital prints, reportedly making up 50–60% of the total release; in India, the film was exhibited in over 1,300 digital theatres, breaking the record previously held by Bodyguard. The wide digital release was implemented to lower distribution costs, make the film accessible to a wider audience and reduce piracy. However, despite the measures taken, pirated versions of Ra.One were available on the Internet within hours of the film's release.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the passage of the new 421-a program, the state {{government}} predicts that the new 421-a program will generate an average of 2,500 affordable housing units to New Yorkers of poor, working-class, and middle class income levels each year. An analysis by the city's Independent Budget Office (IBO) predicted that the program would create roughly 10,000 to 15,800 affordable housing units over ten years at a per unit cost of $568,000. In addition, the agreement made also led the state government <b>to</b> <b>allot</b> an additional $2.5 billion in the state budget in order to create an additional 100,000 affordable housing units and 6,000 supportive housing units. The money was previously held up due to disagreements between Democrats and Republicans in the state government on the usage of those funds.|$|E

25|$|The newly {{independent}} nation of Georgia, which also hosted several bases of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet {{when it was}} the Georgian SSR, also claimed {{a share of the}} Fleet, including 32 naval vessels formerly stationed at Georgia's Black Sea port of Poti. Not a CIS member at that time, Georgia was not, however, included in the initial negotiations in January 1992. Additionally, some low-importance bases situated in the Russian-backed breakaway autonomy of Abkhazia soon escaped any Georgian control. In 1996, Georgia resumed its demands, and the Russian refusal <b>to</b> <b>allot</b> Georgia a portion of the ex-Soviet navy became another bone of contention in the progressively deteriorating Georgian-Russian relations. This time, Ukraine endorsed Tbilisi's claims, turning over several patrol boats to the Georgian Navy and starting to train Georgian crews, but was unable to include in the final fleet deal a transfer of the formerly Poti-based vessels to Georgia. Later, the rest of the Georgian share was decided to be ceded to Russia in return for diminution of debt.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} of the road did not eliminate, however, {{the need for a}} canal, and the Austrian government renewed its persuasive efforts. According to Gazeta de Transilvania in July 1855, Baron Karl Ludwig von Bruck, the Austrian Finance Minister, founded a stock company to build the desired canal. According to an article in Zimbrul on July 23, 1855, the project was of interest to Britain, the French Empire and the Austrian Empire, who were persuading the Ottoman government <b>to</b> <b>allot</b> the concession of the canal and the fitting of the port of Constanța to a consortium {{under the direction of the}} three countries. The Ottomans were to lease a league of land on each side of the canal for 99 years, where colonist could be settled. Goods were to travel freely, with ships having to pay only a per tone tax, significantly lower than the one on the Sulina branch. According to the newspaper Steaua Dunării from January 24, 1856, the Sultan issued a firman to the Anglo-French-Austrian consortium Wilson-Morny-Breda, represented by Forbes Campbell, authorizing it to build the canal which was to be called Abdul Medjid. The 12 articles of the Concession Act were published in Bukurester Deutsche Zeitung.|$|E
25|$|In 1975 Bjelke-Petersen played {{what turned}} out to be a key role in the {{political}} crisis that brought down the Whitlam government. When Labor Senator Bertie Milliner died suddenly in June 1975, Bjelke-Petersen requested from the Labor Party a short list of three nominees, from which he would pick one. The ALP refused to supply such a list, instead nominating Mal Colston, an unsuccessful Labor candidate in the 1970 election, whom Bjelke-Petersen duly rejected. On 3 September Bjelke-Petersen announced that he had selected political novice Albert Field, a long-time ALP member who was critical of the Whitlam government. Field's appointment was the subject of a High Court challenge and he took leave in late 1975. During this period, the Coalition led by Malcolm Fraser declined <b>to</b> <b>allot</b> a pair to balance Field's absence. This gave the Coalition control over the Senate. Fraser used that control to obstruct passage of the Supply Bills through Parliament, denying Whitlam's then-unpopular government the legal capacity to appropriate funds for government business and leading to his dismissal as Prime Minister. During the tumultuous election campaign precipitated by Whitlam's dismissal by Sir John Kerr, Bjelke-Petersen alleged that Queensland police investigations had uncovered damaging documentation in relation to the Loans Affair. This documentation was never made public and these allegations remained unsubstantiated.|$|E

Chetwinde attempted to move into the publishing business after his marriage; but he faced opposition from the established booksellers and publishers, since he had not risen through the apprentice system of the Stationers Company. Chetwinde used his rights to Jonson's works in the publication of the Second Jonson folio of 1640/1, though that volume's publisher of record was Richard Meighen. It was not until 1653 that Chetwinde was able to operate fully as a stationer.|$|R
