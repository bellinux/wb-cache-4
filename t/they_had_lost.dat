5|$|Along {{with the}} loss of their land, local {{residents}} discovered that they had been disenfranchised. Now a part of the ACT, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> their vote in the New South Wales government, and their numbers were too small to warrant a seat in the new federal parliament. As a result, they had no representation in parliament through which to argue against the provisions of the legislation.|$|E
5|$|Bradley's {{election}} in 1895 had {{marked the first}} time in Kentucky's history that the Commonwealth had elected a Republican governor. Angry Democrats, who had controlled the governorship since the fall of the Whig Party, sought to regain what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost.</b> Bitter divisions in the party led to a contentious convention that nominated William Goebel as the party candidate. A faction of the Democratic Party held a second nominating convention and chose former governor John Y. Brown as their nominee.|$|E

5|$|Despite Scotland {{having the}} {{advantage}} in the group, thanks to a superior goal difference, {{they went into the}} game as underdogs due to a number of their senior players being unavailable due to either injury or suspension, and because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> to Wales in the return fixture at Hampden Park in Glasgow the previous March. Despite this, Scotland achieved the draw they needed to go to the next stage of qualifying, {{while at the same time}} virtually eliminating Wales from the competition.|$|E
5|$|The 1965 FA Cup Final was an {{association}} football match between Liverpool and Leeds United on 1 May 1965 at Wembley Stadium, London.

5|$|The {{attack on}} Orsonga began at 3:30pm, {{following}} a half-hour artillery bombardment, and marked the battalion's first battle on Italian soil. Although initially some progress was made, the Germans {{managed to hold}} Orsonga throughout December amidst intense hand-to-hand fighting. Finally, the Māoris were withdrawn from the line {{on the night of}} 15/16 January 1944 when they were relieved by an Indian unit. Over the course of the battle, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> 11 men killed and 222 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The war also {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of Athens' resurgence as a power in the Greek world. With their walls and their fleet restored, the Athenians were in position to turn their eyes overseas.

Organisations such as Citizens' Initiative reported that the violence resulted in the disturbance of children's studies {{and that there was}} a lack of counselling. Students at Gujarat University were unable to take examinations, which were cancelled due to the chances of disruption. While other schools in the state had to postpone or cancel exams, it was reported that some schools held examinations under police protection. It was also reported that many students were forced to leave their studies due to lack of funds or to earn a livelihood because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> income-earning members of their families.|$|E
5|$|Although the Battle of Pelagonia has {{frequently}} {{been described as}} a decisive turning point, Michael VIII Palaiologos' gains were rapidly reversed and his rivals quickly regained their strength, with both the Epirotes and Manfred of Sicily reclaiming most of the territories <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost.</b> Nevertheless, the effects of the battle were not wholly undone: Palaiologos' victory, gained with the assistance of John Doukas, not only prevented the Epirote–Latin league of 1259 from taking Thessalonica and much of Nicaea's European domains, but also provided a valuable breathing space in the lead-up to the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261, which led to the re-establishment of the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologan dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Emerging {{from among}} the Palestinian {{refugees}} who fled or were expelled from their villages {{as a result of}} the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, in the mid-1950s the fedayeen began mounting cross-border operations into Israel from Syria, Egypt and Jordan. The earliest infiltrations were often to access the lands agricultural products <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> {{as a result of the}} war, or to attack Israeli military, and sometimes civilian targets. The Gaza Strip, the sole territory of the All-Palestine Protectorate—an Palestinian state declared in October 1948, became the focal point of the Palestinian fedayeen activity. Fedayeen attacks were directed on Gaza and Sinai borders with Israel, and as a result Israel undertook retaliatory actions, targeting the fedayeen that also often targeted the citizens of their host countries, which in turn provoked more attacks.|$|E

5|$|General McDowell then ordered Shelby and Clarke to take Musgrove's Mill, a British encampment on the Enoree River. They rode {{all night}} with two hundred men, {{reaching}} their location about dawn on August 18, 1780. The colonists had estimated the enemy force was of comparable size, but an advance scout brought word there were approximately 500 British soldiers in the camp who were preparing for battle. Shelby's men and horses were too tired for a retreat and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> the element of surprise. He ordered his men to construct a breastwork from nearby logs and brush. In half an hour the makeshift fortifications were complete, and twenty-five colonial riders charged the British camp to provoke the attack. The British pursued {{them back to the}} main colonial force. Despite being outnumbered, the colonists killed several British officers and put their army to flight.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} debut in {{first-class}} cricket for Cambridge University, {{where he was}} awarded his Blue. He then spent nine seasons playing for Somerset, and captained the side {{for the last five}} of those seasons. Working as a schoolmaster at Highgate School in London from 1876–1884, his playing opportunities for the south-western county were limited, and from 1885 he only played first-class cricket at Lord's, representing Middlesex in three matches that season, and appearing for the MCC on nine occasions over six years. He returned to play for Somerset in 1887 and 1890 when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> their first-class status. He worked as headmaster of Loudon House School in London for some years from 1888, and died following an operation in 1916 in Ipswich.|$|E
5|$|Henry's chief minister, Hubert de Burgh {{fell from}} power in 1232. His old rival, Peter des Roches, {{returned}} to England from the crusades in August 1231 and allied himself with Hubert's {{growing number of}} political opponents. He put the case to Henry that the Justiciar had squandered royal money and lands, and was responsible {{for a series of}} riots against foreign clerics. Hubert took sanctuary in Merton College Chapel, but Henry had him arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Des Roches took over the King's government, backed by the Poitevin baronial faction in England, who saw this as a chance to take back the lands which <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> to Hubert's followers in the previous decades.|$|E

However, when NSB had tried to sell Timetoget, this agreement {{was not part of the}} estate. By April, NSB estimated that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> NOK10 million on their engagement in Timetoget. However, they had three Y1 trains, and would be able to start using them on the Bratsberg Line and the Arendal Line.|$|E
5|$|In the Ohio River valley, the American Revolutionary War {{was fought}} {{primarily}} between American colonists {{south and west}} of the Ohio River (in present-day Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky) and American Indians with their British allies north of the river (now the Midwestern United States). From Detroit, the British recruited and supplied Indian war parties to attack American forts and settlements, hoping to divert American military resources from the primary theater {{of war in the}} East as well as keeping the Indians—and the lucrative fur trade—firmly attached to the British Empire. Indians of the Ohio Country, primarily the Shawnee, Mingo, Delaware, and Wyandot, hoped to drive American settlers out of Kentucky and reclaim their hunting grounds, which <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768) and Lord Dunmore's War (1774).|$|E
5|$|In the West, {{however, the}} loose {{ends of the}} Diocletianic {{settlement}} were about to bring the whole Tetrarchic tapestry down. Constantine, son of Constantius, and Maxentius, son of Maximian, had been overlooked in the Diocletianic succession, offending the parents and angering the sons. Constantine, against Galerius's will, succeeded his father on July 25, 306. He immediately ended any ongoing persecutions and offered Christians full restitution of what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> under the persecution. This declaration gave Constantine the opportunity to portray himself as a possible liberator of oppressed Christians everywhere. Maxentius, meanwhile, had seized power in Rome on October 28, 306, and soon brought toleration to all Christians within his realm. Galerius made two attempts to unseat Maxentius, but failed both times. During the first campaign against Maxentius, Severus was captured, imprisoned, and executed.|$|E
