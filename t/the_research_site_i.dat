40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with methodological issues arising from a retrospective partially insider study of a divorce support website. I argue that, while we need to conduct detailed retrospective studies into the development of online communities, such studies bring methodological challenges, due to their retrospective nature, the potential size of the data set, and the problems of dealing with past manifestations of sites that continue to function. After an introduction to online and offline ethnography and insider/outsider researcher positioning, I discuss my hybrid insider/outsider status with respect to <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>site.</b> <b>I</b> focus in particular on researcher positioning, field entry and delimitation, public/private boundaries, ethical issues, and questions of time with respect to carrying out retrospective online studies while maintaining an ongoing real-time engagement with a research site...|$|E
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThis {{research}} {{explored the}} role of men in efforts by the Malawi Ministry of Health to promote women’s reproductive and maternal health in accordance with Millennium Development Goal (MDG) number five, i. e. to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters between 1990 and 2015. The study was conceptualised in 2011 {{in an effort to}} contribute to the national strategy to reduce maternal mortality in Malawi, and it was done in the particular cultural context of a matrilineal marriage and kinship system in Ntchisi district, Malawi. At the inception of this study, the highest prevalence of maternal deaths in the country was reported in seven districts, including Ntchisi. A common understanding in public health circles worldwide is that male involvement in reproductive and maternal health activities {{is an important factor in}} achieving the above MDG goal. But historically, research on maternal health in Malawi has focused mostly on women and children. Consequently there are only a small number of relevant previous studies or extant literature to draw on for the current investigation. Malawi’s reproductive and maternal health policies largely lack locally-informed research on men and masculinities. My study aimed to explore the relationship between local constructions of masculinity, fatherhood and reproductive health in Malawi among Chichewa speakers who live in Ntchisi. It was guided by the social constructionist theory which recognises {{the role of}} the impersonal features of the social world like cultural, personal and group influences in the construction of ideas, knowledge and facts. In this study I adopted an inductive approach to learning in which the participants were the main players in describing and explaining social phenomena as they are constructed and experienced in <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>site.</b> <b>I</b> conducted multiple in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with 53 married men, key informant interviews with eight local leaders and traditional birth attendants, as well as focus group discussions with 12 married women who had given birth multiple times. Data analysis involved intensive scrutiny of transcripts to determine prevailing themes. Listening to the tapes and re-reading these transcripts enabled me to detect patterns and categorise different practices and constructions, to find associations between these practices and constructions of concepts. Malawi’s men are considered to be the traditional gatekeepers of maternal and social ideals. Therefore, as elders in a clan or as husbands, their prompt decisions can facilitate the access of their spouses to maternal and reproductive health services. Men as heads of households and decision makers can also support and enable their wives to follow the recommended maternal health counsel. However, men’s “lack of involvement” is not the principal reason why there is increasing maternal challenges among child-bearing women in Ntchisi. Although men are not entirely free of the blame for contributing to the status quo, they already work hard towards ensuring positive pregnancy outcomes for their spouses. The study found that husbands in Ntchisi have long been involved in pregnancy and child care. The study shows that pregnancy is regarded as a liminal state or as a kind of “sickness”. Male involvement in pregnancy means the man should take over the routine household chores of drawing water, fetching firewood and cooking, among other things. However, men construct their involvement in reproductive and maternal health matters in the framework of masculinity and femininity as dictated by the commonly held beliefs of a matrilineal Chewa grouping. The study showed that masculinities are constructed within the context of a matrilineal system, which has nonetheless been changing largely due to the colonial impact of the United Kingdom, the related influences of Christian and westernised social ideals and an education system based on the British model. Men’s gendered practices in reproduction and parenting have foundations in the initiation rites of the secret Nyau societies where the masculine ideals of sexuality and secrecy are inculcated. This research cannot be generally extrapolated to the wider population in Malawi but it is a starting point for understanding the responses of matrilineal Chichewa speaking men to reproductive and maternal health matters. Further and broader research on the construction of fatherhood and masculinity is needed in Malawi to make it possible for public health policy on reproductive and maternal health to be more culturally informed...|$|E

Exploratory and conclusive research is designed by the researcher. Target population: Primary Sampling Units (PSU) are all <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>sites,</b> <b>i.</b> e. <b>the</b> small and medium rice mills located in Ampara Coastal area. Secondary Sampling Units (PSU) are all the respondents i. e. mill owners who own small and medium rice mills in this area. Sample size of the PSU is selected by using cumulative total method. SSU is selected from the selected PSUs. Of the 182 rice mills, researcher has selected 88 rice mills as PSU. Brands sold byrice mill owners are White Long, Short White, Red Samba, Red Bolai (Autocaran), White Samba, Keeri Samba, AT Red, and Baasmadi. Rice mill owners use white, lightyellow and light green bags for packaging their rice. Rice mill owners maintain via sand free rice, stone free rice and black free rice by respective machines. Pearson Correlation has been conducted between sales of types of brand and quantity of Kilogrammes sold for those types of brand. Values of Pearson correlation between Sales for White Long, Short White, Red Samba, Red Bolai, White Samba, Keeri Samba and AT Red and weights of them {{show that there is}} a strong positive correlation. There is weak correlation between the sales of Baasmadi and the weights of Baasmadi. Sig. (p values) of Sales for White Long, Short White, Red Samba, Red Bolai, White Samba, Keeri Samba and AT Red are 0. 000. These values are less than O. OS except Sales for Baasmadi. It is determined that that method of quality maintenance population category i. e. sand free rice population, stone free rice population and black free rice population differs in terms of their sales. Sig. (p values) of Sales for White Long, Short White, Red Samba, Red Bolai, White Samba, Keeri Samba and AT Red are 0. 000. These values are less than 0. 05 except Sales for Baasmadi.

40|$|On July 9 th 2011 South Sudan {{declared}} its independence. A referendum was organized in January {{the same year}} where the vast majority voted for secession. It {{was the end of}} the second civil war with the Sudan. The two wars have had a major impact on the local population, and several millions have been displaced. For many of them, the end of the second civil war is the beginning of a new chapter in life. They start building up their lives in the new country. The challenges of this process constitute the starting point of this thesis. The main objective of this study is to compare the challenges of returnees’ integration in Juba and Yei county. This kind of study is important due to the extent of return to post-war South Sudan and because of the impact integration has on those who return and on the new country. The study is based on qualitative research methods. I did 41 semi-structured interviews and arranged two focus-group discussions with returnees, and interviewed representatives of the government and various organisations in the country. The intention is to do a narrative analysis by presenting the views of these actors on the challenges of integration. In order to categorize the challenges and see how they have an impact on the returnees, I will use a livelihood approach. By using this approach I hope to illustrate the connection between the household’s assets, the social factors and the wider context. In the first part of the analysis, I present the main challenges of integration separately and illustrate that there are similarities and differences in Juba and in Yei county. Issues like education and health are important both places, while infrastructure and language are examples of differences between <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>sites.</b> While <b>I</b> present these challenges, I argue that the returnees, the organisations and the government focus on the same issues but have different approaches and priorities. In the second part of the analysis, I state that the various challenges cannot be treated separately nevertheless. Instead, it is necessary to look at how different assets are connected with one another and how they depend on social factors and the wider context. I will also illustrate that the government and the organisations in South Sudan emphasize the coordination of their work, but lose focus on the interconnectedness of integration. Further, it is possible to question if their work is reflecting the returnees’ views on what the problems are. Hence, I find in-depth understanding of the key challenges necessary. This understanding must be based on the interconnectedness and interdependence between assets, social factors and the wider context...|$|R
