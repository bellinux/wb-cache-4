2500|$|On February 26, 2004, O'Donnell married Kelli Carpenter, {{a former}} Nickelodeon {{marketing}} executive, in San Francisco {{two weeks after}} San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom authorized the granting of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Her {{decision to go to}} San Francisco to marry Carpenter was seen as a show of defiance against then-U.S. President George W. Bush over his support for the Federal Marriage Amendment. She said in 2004, [...] "We were both inspired to come here after the sitting President made the vile and hateful comments he made ... ne thought ran <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> on the plane out here – with liberty and justice for all." [...] The couple was married by San Francisco Treasurer Susan Leal, one of the city's highest ranking lesbian officials, and serenaded by the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus. O'Donnell said during the trial over Rosie magazine she had decided to marry Carpenter, in part because even though they acted as spouses they legally were no closer than friends: [...] "We applied for spousal privilege and were denied it by the state. As a result, everything that I said to Kelli, every letter that I wrote her, every e-mail, every correspondence and conversation was entered into the record ... I am now and will forever be a total proponent of gay marriage." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I fainted, and as I did so it flashed <b>through</b> <b>my</b> darkening <b>mind</b> that I {{was passing}} {{down into the}} last {{oblivion}} of death.|$|R
60|$|All this flashed <b>through</b> <b>my</b> anguished <b>mind</b> in {{one brief}} throb of time, as I waited, marvelling {{what he would}} do, what say, in answer to that dismissal.|$|R
60|$|When I at last ended {{this night}} {{of travel and}} got to bed, I failed to keep <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> on {{comfortable}} thoughts of Seaman's Homes (not overdone with strictness), and improved dock regulations giving Jack greater benefit of fire and candle aboard ship, <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind's</b> wandering among the vermin I had seen. Afterwards the same vermin ran all over my sleep. Evermore, when on a breezy day I see Poor Mercantile Jack running into port with a fair wind under all sail, I shall think of the unsleeping host of devourers who never go to bed, and are always in their set traps waiting for him.|$|R
60|$|All this passed rapidly <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> as I {{returned}} his salutation.|$|E
60|$|While {{this thought}} was passing <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> the {{stranger}} resumed his explanations.|$|E
60|$|Dim {{memories}} of Mrs. Mackridge floated <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> as I listened to her....|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet," [...] said {{my friend}} the sculptor, embodying {{in this image}} the {{thoughts}} that had been passing <b>through</b> <b>my</b> own <b>mind,</b> [...] "that broken rose has shed its sweet smell through forty years of the good woman's life." ...|$|R
60|$|She was dead, dead, dead! The hideous phrase boomed {{again and}} again <b>through</b> <b>my</b> distracted <b>mind.</b> Compared with that {{overwhelming}} catastrophe, what signified to me the how or why or when she had died. She was dead, and the world was empty.|$|R
60|$|The {{same thing}} {{had been running}} <b>through</b> <b>my</b> own <b>mind,</b> {{and the result was}} that I wrote Harry, who, being of a {{speculative}} disposition, arranged for an interim payment, and sent me a remittance, which was duly invested in a joint transaction with Jasper, who had rather over-purchased.|$|R
60|$|As these {{thoughts}} were passing <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> {{the door opened}} and the lady herself appeared.|$|E
60|$|It {{was exactly}} what had been passing <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> and I confessed it. He shrugged his shoulders.|$|E
60|$|A sudden thought passed <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> I {{would grant}} her request, but I would demand a favour in return.|$|E
6000|$|... “Are you certain she’s lost? asks George. It {{would be}} an awful blow after all the agonies I have gone <b>through</b> in <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> since you first spoke to me, {{if she were to}} be got off—and—and—all this temptation to begin over again. [...] . For we {{had nothing to do with}} this; had we? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was just}} that idea that was passing <b>through</b> <b>my</b> own <b>mind.</b> Men and women are anxious {{to give you the}} best they have, but it is in order that you may admire their wealth or their taste; and they strive to be witty, amusing, and sarcastic! but that, again, is for the éclat they are to gain. How few really {{struggle}} to make those around them comfortable!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What would ye expect? When ye're born good-looking, ye {{must take}} the consequences. But, as Grahame has nae manners, I'll present myself--Andrew Macallister, extra chief's ticket, and noo, <b>through</b> {{speaking}} <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to a director, engineer o' this barge." [...] He indicated his greasy companion. [...] "Mr. Walthew, who, though ye might not think it by his look, was taught at Harvard. If my temper stands the strain, I may make a useful greaser o' him yet. The other ye nae doot ken." ...|$|R
60|$|I gave {{a hollow}} groan as these {{reflections}} passed <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> and this appeared to afford William Bludger some consolation.|$|E
60|$|And again Powell {{seemed to}} lose {{himself in the}} past. I asked, for {{suddenly}} {{the vision of the}} Fynes passed <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
60|$|DEAR MR. HALL,--You make a {{suggestion}} which has {{once or twice}} flitted dimly <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> heretofore to wit, sell L. A. L.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{again we}} were {{struggling}} forward <b>through</b> the bushes, <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> {{filled with a}} great wonder that grew slowly to a whirling nothingness. For a while {{it seemed to me}} as though I were lost in an evil dream and walking on red hot irons in my dream. Then came a vision of armed men with lifted spears, and of Otomie running towards them with outstretched arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "This house ain't hardly {{big enough}} for me and old Martha," [...] said Mary darkly. [...] "It's a very fine thing to have enough to eat--I've often {{wondered}} what it would be like--but I'm p'ticler about my cooking. And Mrs. Wiley'll be here yet. SHE'S got a rod in pickle for me all right. I don't think about it so much in daytime but say, girls, up there in that garret at night I git to thinking and thinking of it, till I just almost wish she'd come and have it over with. I dunno's one real good whipping would be much worse'n all the dozen I've lived <b>through</b> in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> ever since I run away. Were any of you ever licked?" ...|$|R
6000|$|We pay dearly for our want of sincerity. We {{are denied}} {{the payment of}} praise: it has ceased to have any value. People shake me warmly {{by the hand and}} tell me that they like my books. It only bores me. Not that I am {{superior}} to compliment--nobody is--but because I cannot be sure that they mean it. They would say just the same had they never read a line I had written. If I visit a house and find a book of mine open face downwards on the window-seat, it sends no thrill of pride <b>through</b> <b>my</b> suspicious <b>mind.</b> As likely as not, I tell myself, the following is the conversation that has taken place between my host and hostess the day before my arrival: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{know not}} what flashed <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> but {{something}} suddenly impelled me; and grasping his hand, I swore to {{him what he}} demanded.|$|E
6000|$|The House came to {{attention}} with a parting of the lips like a hiccough, and it flashed <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind....</b> Pallant repeated, 'Huckley. The village--' ...|$|E
6000|$|Figures {{of speech}} always {{distract}} me, and it ran <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> like some puzzling refrain, [...] "It {{is still the}} same light. [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Monsieur Berty?" [...] I murmured, <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> in a turmoil, my {{thoughts}} running riot <b>through</b> <b>my</b> brain. [...] "The Englishmen, the mules, the packs?" ...|$|R
60|$|Of course, I {{had nothing}} more to say, and he promised to send me the tree the next morning, though, of course, {{requesting}} me to pay him in advance, which was {{the rule of the}} office, and you would be amazed, madam, if you knew how much that tree cost. I got it the next morning, but I haven't shown it to Jone yet. I am proud that I own it, and I have thrills <b>through</b> me whenever <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> goes back to its Norman roots; but I am bound to say that family trees sometimes throw a good deal of shade over their owners, especially when they have gaps in them, which seems contrary to nature, but is true to fact.|$|R
60|$|I was {{thinking}} of revenge--revenge against the primary conditions of my being. I {{was thinking}} of Nettie and her lover. I was firmly resolved {{he should not have}} her--though I had to kill them both to prevent it. I did not care what else might happen, if only that end was ensured. All my thwarted passions had turned to rage. I would have accepted eternal torment that night without a second thought, to be certain of revenge. A hundred possibilities of action, a hundred stormy situations, a whirl of violent schemes, chased one another <b>through</b> <b>my</b> shamed, exasperated <b>mind.</b> The sole prospect I could endure was of some gigantic, inexorably cruel vindication of my humiliated self.|$|R
6000|$|I {{could only}} gasp. For one brief moment the thought rushed <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that I would {{denounce}} {{him to the}} police for [...] . for [...] .|$|E
60|$|How {{tall and}} soldierly he looked! And the thought flashed <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that if Otto killed {{him he would}} be lying there a dead, inanimate thing.|$|E
60|$|You {{may take}} these {{reflections}} as passing <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> {{while we were}} driving through street after street, and going round corner after corner, towards the parsonage.|$|E
60|$|The {{first week}} in June will about see me <b>through</b> <b>my</b> present work, I hope. I came to town hurriedly to attend poor dear Emerson Tennent's funeral. You will know how <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> went back, in the York up-train at midnight, to Mount Vesuvius and our Neapolitan supper.|$|R
30|$|Felting was fun! Last time I felted {{was as a}} child, and felting brought nice {{memories}} to <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>My</b> own {{wool fibre}} dyeing did not turn out well, and that’s why I changed fibres with my classmate. The final felted outcome was not a beautiful one, {{but the most important}} thing was the feeling when the material changed when worked <b>through</b> <b>my</b> fingers. (Table 1 : Picture 5).|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, Paret," [...] he replied, {{putting his}} hand <b>through</b> <b>my</b> arm, [...] "there's a little legal {{business}} in prospect down here {{that will require}} some handling, and I wish you'd come down after the campaign and talk it over, with us. I've just about made up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that you're he man to tackle it." ...|$|R
