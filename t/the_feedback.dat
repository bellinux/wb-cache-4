40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we examine <b>the</b> Model <b>Feedback</b> Control System. Since <b>the</b> Model <b>Feedback</b> Control System is simple, <b>the</b> ModeI <b>Feedback</b> ControI System {{has been applied}} to many {{applications}} such as the trajectory control of robot manipulator, level control of serially connected tanks and so on. Since the control structure of <b>the</b> ModeI <b>Feedback</b> Control System has constrained, it is likely that <b>the</b> Model <b>Feedback</b> Control System can not represent all of stabilizing controllers for the plant.

The purpose of the present paper is to give a solution to the question whether or not, all of stabilizing controllers for the plant are written as <b>the</b> Model <b>Feedback</b> Control structure. Since Model Feedback Control System is applied to many minimum phase systems, in the present paper, we especially clarify the relationship between <b>the</b> ModeI <b>Feedback</b> Control System and the parametrization of all stabilizing controllers for the minimum phase system.

40|$|ArticleOpen access articleTropical climate {{feedback}} {{mechanisms are}} assessed using satellite-observed and model-simulated trends in tropical tropospheric temperature from the MSU/AMSU instruments and upper-tropospheric humidity from the HIRS instruments. Despite discrepancies in {{the rates of}} tropospheric warming between observations and models, both are consistent with constant relative humidity over the period 1979 [...] 2008. Because uncertainties in satellite-observed tropical-mean trends preclude a constraint on tropical-mean trends in models we also explore regional features of <b>the</b> <b>feedbacks.</b> <b>The</b> regional pattern of <b>the</b> lapse rate <b>feedback</b> is primarily determined by the regional pattern of surface temperature changes, as tropical atmospheric warming is relatively horizontally uniform. The regional pattern of <b>the</b> water vapor <b>feedback</b> {{is influenced by the}} regional pattern of precipitation changes, with variations of 1 [...] 2 W m- 2 K- 1 across the Tropics (compared to a tropical-mean feedback magnitude of 3. 3 [...] 4 W m- 2 K- 1). Thus the geographical patterns of water vapor and lapse rate feedbacks are not correlated, but when <b>the</b> <b>feedbacks</b> are calculated in precipitation percentiles rather than in geographical space they are anti-correlated, with strong positive water vapor feedback associated with strong negative lapse rate <b>feedback.</b> <b>The</b> regional structure of <b>the</b> <b>feedbacks</b> is not related to the strength of <b>the</b> tropical-mean <b>feedback</b> in a subset of the climate models from the CMIP 5 archive.
