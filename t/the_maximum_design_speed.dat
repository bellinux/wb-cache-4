50|$|In {{response}} to the 1955 visit to Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey {{by one of the}} V200 prototypes, Turkish Railways - TCDD - ordered three Krauss-Maffei ML 2700 locomotives in 1960. As with the Yugoslavian ML2200 locomotives the Turkish locomotives had six axles, however the design was a departure from the V200 carbody style with the final product looking more like contemporary US road switcher locomotives with a European twist. The locomotives were symmetrical in design with two long hoods covering the engines, transmissions and auxiliaries and a single raised driving cab separating the two hoods {{in the middle of the}} locomotive. Each locomotive had two Maybach MD655 engines rated at 1,350 hp/994 kW, each coupled to a Voith L630rU transmission which was equipped for hydrodynamic braking. The locomotives were 19,670 mm long over buffers, weighed 111 tonnes in working order and were fitted with a Vapor train heating boiler manufactured by Hagenuk under licence. <b>The</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> of the locomotives was 100km/h. Krauss Maffei was asked to design the locomotives so that they could work effectively at high temperatures - up to 35°C - and at altitudes up to 800m above sea level. Before delivery the locomotives were tested over the severely curved and graded Schwarzwaldbahn between Offenburg and Villingen, hauling freight trains normally operated by V200 locomotives. The locomotives left the Krauss Maffei works in München on 9 October 1961 and made their way to Ankara, Turkey, under their own power. TCDD numbered the locomotives DH27 001 - DH27 003, the corresponding Krauss Maffei works numbers being 18 702 - 18 704. TCDD started testing and training crews on the locomotives in December 1961 with entry into regular service being achieved in 1962. The locomotives worked freight and passenger trains radiating from Ankara until TCDD retired them in 1982.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} a virtual reality {{experimental}} survey, aimed at evaluating how cross-section width affects driver’s behaviour, are reported. Two two-lane rural roads were implemented in an interactive driving simulator. Each one is characterised by a different cross section width but same alignment. The configurations of the surveyed cross sections were those recommended by the Italian technical regulation for rural roads (type C 1) and for local roads (type F 2). The alignment was designed with tangents, clothoids and curves. 64 drivings were performed. Four parameters were determined on each geometrical element of the alignment with different cross section width: average speed, range of speed, average trajectory and range of lateral position on cross section. The narrowing of the cross section width causes the decrease of speed but does not alter the way the driver adjusts his speed driving from a design elements to another along the alignment. The adjustment of the speed is therefore affected exclusively by the geometry of the axis of the alignment. The values of speed obtained indicate that the assumption of <b>the</b> same <b>maximum</b> <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> (Vdmax) for <b>the</b> design of alignments with different cross section width determines a degree of safety, {{with respect to the}} stopping manoeuvre, that is inferior in alignments with a wider section. With respect to the values collected on cross section C 1, on the cross section F 2 a greater dispersion of speed and a greater number of cases of occupation of the shoulder and of the opposite lane (an event which was never recorded in section C 1), were recorded. The importance of the shoulder in the driver’s choice of lateral position and his propensity to drive near the axis of the space he perceives as utilizable, consisting of the lane and shoulder, was confirmed...|$|R

5000|$|The Seagull {{outboard}} motor had a simple single cylinder water-cooled two-stroke engine. Atop {{the engine was}} a magneto, and on its port side was a simple carburetter with no air filter. Even a rudimentary rubber [...] "storm cowl" [...] was an optional extra, and induction noise when running was pronounced. Above the cylinder head was bolted a small brass fuel tank whose 10:1 fuel/oil mix was gravity-fed to the carb via a clear plastic tube that served to capture dirt particles in its U-bend. A simple plastic filter filter on the banjo union to the carb gave rudimentary secondary filtering, {{but it was still}} not unusual for the carb jets to become blocked. Starting was effected with a hand-wound pull-rope, although a recoil starter became an option in due course. Connecting the motor to the gearbox and propeller werere two downtubes, the forward one containing the drive shaft and the aft tube serving as the exhaust, which vented underwater. This arrangement meant that the engine could not be rotated 360 degrees as can more modern engines. The Seagull handbook advises that the engine can be safely run at full throttle (partly to prevent the spark-plug from oiling up) but adds that is wasteful to try to exceed <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> of a displacement hull, suggesting a [...] "one-third open throttle" [...] usually suffices. The engines proved very rugged as they used high quality materials, and would last for years even in harsh marine environments and in developing countries. Seagull outboards were utilitarian in nature with a relatively slow-turning prop, and so were ideal for use in dinghies, tenders and small yachts. The Silver Century Plus model could propel a displacement hull of up to 26 feet in length; but all Seagull outboards were unsuitable for high speed craft.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the case}} of railway traction, an {{analysis}} on the influence the running resistance about the fuel consumption for the motors vehicles equipped with an internal source of energy(diesel engine or gas turbine) is necessary and {{from the perspective of}} the optimal way of their exploitation. This paper aims to determine the influence they have the aerodynamic phenomena on the running resistance and therefore to the fuel consumption, in case of traction vehicles equipped with diesel motors which are operated by the railway companies in Romania. To achieve the study, we considered the following vehicles: diesel electric locomotives LDE 060 DA of 2100 CP, LDE 060 DD of 4000 CP, LDE 060 EGM of 2100 CP, Carpathia DEM of 2300 CP and railcar Siemens Desiro.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{undertaken}} as part {{fulfillment of the}} degree of Yacht and Powercraft Design (BEng) at Southampton Solent University. The project developed the design of a 15 -metre, trawler-style flybridge motor yacht in addition to researching the potential use of propeller tunnels on the design hull. Trawler-style motor yachts are traditionally designed with long-distance cruising in mind and as such are typically round-bilge displacement or semi-displacement type hulls. There are however, a number of higher performance trawler-style motor yachts on the market aimed at weekend and shorter range cruising. These are produced by manufacturers such as Grand Banks, Hardy Marine, Seaward, Beneteau and Nimbus. This project centered around designing a similar higher performance hull in conjunction with an investigation into the potential use of propeller tunnels or pockets on such a hull. Tunnels or pockets have been and are used on several types of motor vessel including Tyne-class lifeboats, recreational motor yachts, commercial launches and naval vessels. There are several reasons for their use including draft reduction, increased propeller diameter (potential efficiency benefits), and reducing shaft angle (increased potential engine location options and thrust improvements). This report includes a tow tank investigation into the effect of propeller tunnels on hull drag alone, through comparison of two exact scale models. The models were constructed from GRP, one with tunnels and one without, from a GRP female mould taken from a similar style model hull. These models were then tow tank tested through a relevant speed range to compare resistance, heave and trim behaviour. The results indicated that up until <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> required by the brief, the use of partial propeller tunnels provided a small beneficial drag effect. Further in-depth results analysis and propeller efficiency research is provided within this report. However, {{on the basis of these}} results, a decision was taken to incorporate tunnel pockets into the design hull...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{procedure}} for the numerical simulation of train-bridge interaction is described. This {{is based on}} a finite element schematisation of the bridge (and possibly of the track) and on a multi-body schematisation of the railway vehicles. Wheel-rail contact forces are defined using a non-linear contact model which accounts for the main non-linear effects related to wheel-rail contact forces. The numerical procedure considers train-bridge interaction in both the vertical and horizontal plane. With reference to train ride safety and passenger comfort, the dynamic interaction model allows the analysis of the effect of global and local structure deformations on vehicle dynamics. When dealing with long span suspension bridges, in addition to the limits regarding global deformations during train passage, the structure must satisfy restrictive requirements concerning the effect on rail vehicle dynamics produced by structure deformations under wind loads. An example of numerical simulation for the case of an ETR 500 train crossing the Messina bridge at <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>design</b> <b>speed,</b> in the presence of extreme transversal wind conditions was reported. Another interesting example of global interaction analysis is that involving the identification of critical velocity phenomena. The train transit over a bridge generates a periodic excitation whose fundamental frequency depends on the speed and on the distance end-to-end between the coaches; as a consequence, resonance occurs if one of the excitation frequencies approaches one of the bridge's natural frequencies. While this phenomenon is generally negligible in long span bridges, it is particularly interesting for smaller bridges, like the bow-arch bridge considered in the paper as the second case study. Local interaction phenomena involve bridge and track deformations having a scale much smaller than that of the complete bridge. Although being of small entity, local deformations play a key role with respect to the cyclic dynamic stresses induced in the bridge structural elements by repeated train passages and the generation of structural noise and vibrations. One key issue is the design of the track system. An example is presented referring to the comparison of two design alternatives for the Messina bridge track system: a conventional design with rails resting on timber sleepers and an innovative embedded rail system. The analysis was performed by comparing the two design solutions in terms of forces and vibrations locally transmitted to the deck. A numerical-experimental comparison is reported {{at the end of the}} paper, which refers to the measurements taken on a bow-arch bridge on the Milano-Torino high speed line, crossed by a test train at the maximum speed of 280 km/h. The comparison demonstrates the reliability of the developed train-bridge interaction model in reproducing both bridge accelerations and stresses...|$|E
