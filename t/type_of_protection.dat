5|$|All {{enemies are}} {{protected}} by health, shields, armor, barriers, or a combination thereof. Each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> has its own vulnerabilities. For example, armor is usually vulnerable to powers such as Incinerate, which burns enemies over time, and to weapons with a low rate of fire such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols. In contrast, shields are vulnerable to powers such as Overload and to rapid-firing weapons like submachine guns and assault rifles. Barriers are typically used by boss-type enemies and are vulnerable to certain weapons and powers. When the shields, armor, or barriers of an enemy have all been depleted, the player can use status-effect powers such as Pull, which temporarily levitates targets into the air, incapacitating them. Other powers may temporary benefit the player; for instance, Adrenaline Rush puts the player in bullet time. Powers do not require any sort of expendable resource; they only have a global refresh time period.|$|E
2500|$|In {{determining}} the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection,</b> the plurality {{turned to the}} [...] "time, place, or manner" [...] test as implemented in United States v. O'Brien (1968), the four-pronged [...] "O'Brien Test." [...] The plurality found that enacting this sort of legislation was clearly within the constitutional authority of the state, and that the statute furthered a substantial government interest. To understand the legislative intent behind {{the creation of the}} statute, the plurality turned to the history of indecency law, noting an expansive history and breadth of adoption for such legislation. Considering available precedent from cases such as Roth v. United States (1957) and Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), the plurality concluded that the statute furthered a government interest in order and morality.|$|E
2500|$|In Pocerina, {{the region}} {{containing}} Mount Cer in northwestern Serbia, protection from hail {{was provided by}} a gradobranitelj ("hail defender"), who learned the [...] "craft" [...] from another gradobranitelj. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> included the use of magic. The gradobranitelj {{in the village of}} Lipolist was Nikola Stojković, who pursued that vocation for about forty years, until the 1950s. On the night before every bigger feast day, he collected earth and remnants of candles from graves of hanged and drowned persons, flour beneath a millstone, water beneath a water wheel, and dew. Nikola mixed all these ingredients into a mass, from which he made pellets the size of a hazelnut. At the same time he collected dew in a bottle. All the pellets and dew collected from Christmas to Christmas were placed in one bag and one bottle, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Cliff Curtis as Searle, the ship's {{doctor and}} {{psychological}} officer. He {{is obsessed with}} the Sun and how it looks when staring at it without any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection.</b> The role of Searle was originally written to be a [...] "slightly stiff" [...] British character. Curtis {{was drawn to the}} role based on the script and also expressed interest in working with the director. Boyle was familiar with Curtis from Training Day (2001) and Whale Rider (2002), and Curtis's audition appealed to Boyle strongly enough to cast the actor as Searle. Curtis initially foresaw an esoteric approach for his character, but he later pursued a military and scientific approach based on the seriousness of the mission. The actor also compared Searle to the character of Pinbacker, noting their similarities and differences: [...] " [...] would sacrifice those beliefs and views, his life, for the greater good, whereas Pinbacker, who's come to a place he believes is right, would sacrifice the world for his beliefs. They're {{two sides of the same}} coin." ...|$|E
