50|$|The {{competition}} was beset with organisational problems and schedule clashes. Cuba, which had previously sent large delegations, was absent. Temperatures were extremely high (40° Celsius) during the three-day competition and consequently {{the plans for}} the marathon races, scheduled for the final day, were abandoned. The 1990 Central American and Caribbean Games was held in Mexico two months later and preparation for this larger meet meant other athletes chose not to compete at the Ibero-American Championships. As a result, many of the events were principally contested between the top Brazilian and Spanish athletes, who won 31 of the 40 gold medals available between them.
