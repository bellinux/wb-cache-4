25|$|Since salt {{restriction}} is {{the basic}} concept in treatment, and aldosterone {{is one of the}} hormones that acts to increase salt retention, a medication that counteracts aldosterone should be sought. Spironolactone (or other distal-tubule diuretics such as <b>triamterene</b> or amiloride) is the drug of choice since they block the aldosterone receptor in the collecting tubule. This choice has been confirmed in a randomized controlled trial. Diuretics for ascites should be dosed once per day. Generally, the starting dose is oral spironolactone 100nbsp&mg/day (max 400nbsp&mg/day).|$|E

50|$|Amiloride {{works by}} {{directly}} blocking the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) thereby inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts in the kidneys (this mechanism {{is the same}} for <b>triamterene).</b> This promotes the loss of sodium and water from the body, but without depleting potassium.|$|E

50|$|<b>Triamterene</b> is {{commonly}} prepared {{in combination with}} hydrochlorothiazide for treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) and edema (water retention).

Dyazide is marketed by GlaxoSmithKline and Maxzide is marketed by Mylan.|$|E
50|$|However, various {{diseases}} and medications may decrease the body's excretion of potassium, thereby increasing {{the risk of}} potentially fatal hyperkalemia. People with kidney failure, heart failure, or diabetes should not use salt substitutes without medical advice. A manufacturer, LoSalt, has issued an advisory statement that people taking the following prescription drugs should not use a salt substitute: amiloride, <b>triamterene,</b> Dytac, captopril & other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, spironolactone, and eplerenone.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1980s one of {{the most}} {{prescribed}} drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing <b>triamterene</b> and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980. [...] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.|$|E
50|$|The <b>triamterene</b> {{ring system}} {{is found in}} many {{naturally}} occurring compounds, such as folic acid and riboflavin. The observation that the naturally occurring compound xanthopterin had renal affects led scientists at Smith Kline and French Laboratories in Philadelphia to begin a medicinal chemistry campaign to discover potential drugs, {{as part of a}} program to discover potassium-sparing diuretics. The first clinical studies were published in 1961 and the first trials combining it with hydrochlorothiazide were published the next year.|$|E
50|$|<b>Triamterene</b> {{directly}} {{blocks the}} epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) on the lumen {{side of the}} kidney collecting tubule. Other diuretics cause {{a decrease in the}} sodium concentration of the forming urine due to the entry of sodium into the cell via the ENaC, and the concomitant exit of potassium from the principal cell into the forming urine. Blocking ENaC prevents this from happening. Amiloride works in the same way. Sodium channel blockers directly inhibit the entry of sodium into the sodium channels.|$|E
50|$|Because lithium {{competes with}} the receptors for the {{antidiuretic}} hormone in the kidney, it increases water output into the urine, a condition called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Clearance of lithium by the kidneys is usually successful with certain diuretic medications, including amiloride and <b>triamterene.</b> It increases the appetite and thirst ("polydypsia") {{and reduces the}} activity of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism). The latter can be corrected by treatment with thyroxine and {{does not require the}} lithium dose to be adjusted. Lithium is also believed to permanently affect renal function, although this {{does not appear to be}} common.|$|E
50|$|People {{with certain}} rare inborn errors of {{metabolism}} have a propensity to accumulate crystal-forming substances in their urine. For example, those with cystinuria, cystinosis, and Fanconi syndrome may form stones composed of cystine. Cystine stone formation {{can be treated}} with urine alkalinization and dietary protein restriction. People afflicted with xanthinuria often produce stones composed of xanthine. People afflicted with adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency may produce 2,8-dihydroxyadenine stones, alkaptonurics produce homogentisic acid stones, and iminoglycinurics produce stones of glycine, proline and hydroxyproline. Urolithiasis has also been noted {{to occur in the}} setting of therapeutic drug use, with crystals of drug forming within the renal tract in some people currently being treated with agents such as indinavir, sulfadiazine and <b>triamterene.</b>|$|E
50|$|ENaC {{is located}} in the apical {{membrane}} of polarized epithelial cells in particular in the kidney (primarily in the distal tubule), the lung, and the colon. Epithelial sodium channels facilitate Na⁺ reabsorption across the apical membranes of epithelia in the distal nephron, respiratory and reproductive tracts and exocrine glands. Since Na⁺ ion concentration is a major determinant of extracellular fluid osmolarity, changes in Na⁺ concentration affect the movement of fluids and consequently fluid volume and blood pressure. The activity of ENaC in the colon and kidney is modulated by the mineralcorticoid aldosterone. It can be blocked by either <b>triamterene</b> or amiloride, which are used medically to serve as diuretics. In the kidney, it is inhibited by atrial natriuretic peptide, causing natriuresis and diuresis.|$|E

The ratio of 100:40 reduces risks of potassium imbalance. Serum potassium level and renal function should be monitored closely while on these medications.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1992 Barcelona and 1996 Atlanta Opening Ceremonies, Costas's {{remarks on}} China's teams' {{possible}} drug use caused an uproar among the American Chinese and international communities.

Further evidence of Chinese athletes' drug use came in 1997 when Australian authorities confiscated 13 vials of Somatropin, a human growth hormone, from the bag of Chinese swimmer Yuan Yuan upon her arrival for the 1997 World Swimming Championships. At the World Championships, four Chinese swimmers tested positive for the banned substance <b>Triamterene,</b> a diuretic used to dilute urine samples to mask the presence of anabolic steroids.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Triamterene,</b> {{because of}} its potassium-sparing properties, is {{frequently}} used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) to treat patients with hypertension. By inhibiting the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the cortical collecting duct, <b>triamterene</b> reduces potassium secretion, thus {{reducing the risk of}} hypokalemia. Whether <b>triamterene</b> has an independent effect on blood pressure (BP) has not been well studied. OBJECTIVE: To determine if <b>triamterene</b> provides an effect to further lower BP in patients treated with HCTZ. DESIGN: We conducted an observational study using electronic medical record data from the Indiana Network for Patient Care. Participants were 17, 291 patients with the diagnosis of hypertension between 2004 and 2012. MAIN MEASURES: BP was the primary outcome. We compared the BP between patients who were taking HCTZ, with and without <b>triamterene,</b> either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications, by using a propensity score analysis. For each medication combination, we estimated the propensity score (i. e., probability) of a patient receiving <b>triamterene</b> using a logistic regression model. Patients with similar propensity scores were stratified into subclasses and BP was compared between those taking <b>triamterene</b> or not within each subclass; the effect of <b>triamterene</b> was then assessed by combining BP differences estimated from all subclasses. KEY RESULTS: The mean systolic BP in the <b>triamterene</b> + HCTZ group was 3. 8 mmHg lower than in the HCTZ only group (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001); systolic BP was similarly lower for patients taking <b>triamterene</b> with other medication combinations. Systolic BP reduction was consistently observed for different medication combinations. The range of systolic BP reduction was between 1 and 4 mm Hg, depending on the concurrently used medications. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, <b>triamterene</b> was found to enhance the effect of HCTZ to lower BP. In addition to its potassium-sparing action, triamterene's ability to lower BP should also be considered...|$|E
