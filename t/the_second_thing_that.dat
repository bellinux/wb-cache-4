Now this inquiry admits us to search into the things: First, How it appears that he hath power to save; Second, How it appears that he hath power to cast out.|$|E

2500|$|For Tilghman, Princeton has two {{essential}} missions. [...] "One is {{to ensure}} that our doors are open as wide as possible to every talented student in the world who is capable of doing the hard work we ask of them. [...] And that means maintaining our commitment to financial aid, which is the tool – the critical tool – to get those students to Princeton. [...] And <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> is <b>that</b> we must address the most critical issues, and push back the frontiers of knowledge, and not just in science and technology, but in social policy, and in public policy, and in understanding the nature of the human condition." ...|$|R

That irritated me, to begin with. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> turned up was my bottle of Drops. I caught myself {{measuring}} the doses with my eye, and calculating {{how many of them}} would be enough to take a living creature over the border-land between sleep and death.

30|$|A shared view on envy {{is that it}} is a kind of {{negative}} emotion that surfaces when one lacks and desires others’ superior qualities, achievements, or possessions (Parrott & Smith, 1993). Extant literature has uncovered three prerequisites for being envied by others. First, the envied target has <b>the</b> better <b>things.</b> <b>Second,</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> one lacks are vital to his or her self-concept. Third, the envious person perceives that the target is similar to him or her to some extent. (Cohen-Charash & Mueller, 2007).|$|R
500|$|In May 1928, the KCA {{launched}} a Kikuyu-language magazine, Muĩgwithania (roughly translated as [...] "The Reconciler" [...] or [...] "The Unifier"), {{in which it}} published news, articles, and homilies. Its purpose was to help unify the Kikuyu and {{to raise funds for}} the KCA. Kenyatta, now described as Secretary of the KCA, was listed as the publication's editor, although Murray-Brown suggested that he was not the guiding hand behind it and that his duties were largely confined to translating things into Kikuyu. Kenyatta's approach to campaigning was cautious; he was aware that Thuku had been exiled for his activism. In Muĩgwithania, he expressed support for the churches, district commissioners, and chiefs. He also praised the British Empire, stating that: [...] "The first <b>thing</b> [...] is <b>that</b> all people are governed justly, big or small – equally. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> is <b>that</b> nobody is regarded as a slave, everyone is free to do what he or she likes without being hindered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (2.) <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> discovereth one much inclining to the lusts of uncleanness, it is wanton and immodest talk; {{such as that}} brazen-faced whore in the 7th of the Proverbs had, or such as they in Peter, who allured 'through the lusts of the flesh, {{through much}} wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error' (2 Peter 2:18). 'Out of the {{abundance}} of the heart the mouth speaketh,' wherefore if we be saints, let us take heed, as of our eye, so of our tongue, and let not the lust of uncleanness, or of adultery, be once named among us, 'named among us as becometh saints' (Eph 5:3). Mark, 'Let it not be once named.' This implies, that the lusts of uncleanness are devilishly taking, they will both take the heart with eyes and tongue: 'Let it not be once named among you,' &c.|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I {{take notice}} of in this prayer of the Pharisee, is his manner of delivery, as he stood praying in the temple: [...] "God, I thank thee," [...] said he, [...] "that I am not as other men are." [...] He seemed to be {{at this time in}} more than an {{ordinary}} frame, while now he stood {{in the presence of the}} divine Majesty: for a prayer made up of praise, is a prayer made up of the highest order, and is most like the way of them that are now in a state beyond prayer. Praise is the work of heaven; but we see here, that an hypocrite may get into that vein, even while an hypocrite, and while on earth below. Nor do I think that this prayer of his was a premeditated stinted form, but a prayer extempore, made on a sudden according to what he felt, thought, or understood of himself.|$|E
6000|$|This shows, therefore, that Christ is {{not ashamed}} {{to own the}} way of our {{justification}} and salvation, no, not before men and devils.

And since our adversary pretends a plea in law against it, it is meet {{that there should be}} an open hearing before the Judge of all about it; but, forasmuch as we neither can nor dare appear to plead for ourselves, our good God has thought fit we should do it by an advocate: [...] "We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." [...] This, therefore, is <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> shows the need that we have of an Advocate-to wit, our adversary pretends that he has a plea in law against us, and that by law we should be otherwise disposed of than to be made possessors of the heavenly kingdom.

60|$|SECOND. We will {{therefore}} come to <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing,</b> to wit, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> godly can distinguish one thing from another. And {{the reason why}} I so conclude, is, as I said, because the throne here is not set forth unto us here, by where or what signs it should be known; it is only propounded to us by its name, a throne of grace, and so left for saints to make their approach thereto: 'Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace.' We {{will therefore}} take this conclusion into two parts, and consider it under this double position. FIRST, That there is a throne of grace. SECOND, That it is the privilege of the godly to distinguish from all other thrones whatever this throne of grace.|$|R
60|$|Second. And {{this leads}} me to <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing,</b> namely, <b>That</b> God makes a man righteous by possessing[3] of him with a {{principle}} of righteousness, even {{with the spirit of}} righteousness (Rom 4:4,5). For though, as to justification before God from the curse of the law, we are made righteous while we are ungodly, and yet sinners; yet being made free from sin thus, we forthwith become, through a change which the Holy Ghost works in our minds, the servants of God (Rom 5:7-9). Hence it is said, 'There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit' (Rom 8:1). For though, as the apostle also insinuates here, that being in Christ Jesus is antecedent to our walking after the Spirit; yet a man can make no demonstration of his being in Christ Jesus, but by his walking in the Spirit; because the Spirit is an inseparable companion of imputed righteousness, and immediately follows it, to dwell with whosoever it is bestowed upon. Now it dwelling in us, principles[4] us in all the powers of our souls, with that which is righteousness in the habit and nature of it. Hence the fruits of the Spirit are called 'the fruits of goodness and righteousness,' as the fruits of a tree are called the fruit of that tree (Eph 5:9).|$|R
6000|$|And {{this was}} {{signified}} by Moses, where {{he speaks of}} the year of jubilee, and of the redemption {{of the house that}} was sold in Israel, how of that year it should return to the owner (Lev 25). Our bodies of right are God's, but sin still dwells in them; we have also sold and forfeited them to death and the grave, and so they will abide; but at the judgment day, that blessed jubilee, God will take our body, which originally is his, and will deliver it from the bondage of corruption, unto which, by our souls, through sin, it has been subjected; he will take it, I say, because it is his, both by creation and redemption, and will bring it to that perfect freedom that is only to be found in immortality and eternal life. And for this should Israel hope! From what hath been said to this first thing, it appears that the mercy that is with God for his people, as it is in general what has been described before, so it is redeeming mercy, or mercy that has with it the virtue of redemption; of the advantageousness of this mercy, we will further discourse by and by, but now we will look into <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> from this amplification of the reason was propounded to be spoken to, to wit, ...|$|E
6000|$|... 2. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I {{take notice}} of from these words is, That this is a {{dispensation}} and manifestation of Gods anger against a man for his sin. When God is angry with men, I mean, when he is so angry with them, this among many {{is one of the}} Judgments that he giveth them up unto, to wit, to blindness of mind, and hardness of heart, which he also suffereth to accompany them till they enter in at the gates of death. And then, and there, and not short of then and there, their eyes come to be opened. Hence it is said of the rich man mentioned in Luke, He dyed, and in Hell he lifted up his eyes: {174a} Implying that he did not lift them up before: He neither saw what he had done, nor whither he was going, till he came to the place of execution, even into Hell. He died asleep in his soul; he dyed bespotted, stupified, and so consequently for quietness, like a Child or Lamb, even as Mr. Badman did: this was a sign of Gods anger; he had a mind to damn him for his sins, and therefore would not let him see nor have an heart to repent for them, lest he should convert, and his damnation, which God had appointed, should be frustrate: lest they should be converted, and I should heal them.|$|E
50|$|According to Torah Aura (especially {{co-owner}} Joel Grishaver), <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{leads to}} Jewish survival is connection to community. The simple {{truth is that}} Jews who need other Jews {{are more likely to}} seek out Jewish connections than those who have just enjoyed some Jewish activities. This is why anyone in the Jewish schooling business pushes camps and youth groups as companion experiences. And, it is why anyone who understands the simplest secret looks to make their classrooms into communities with interdependent learning as a major modality. Equally true, the relationship between teacher and student is critical. It has redemptive possibilities. Because of Torah Aura's belief in community, most of their material (and all of their teacher’s guides) recommend work in hevrutot (learning dyads or small groups) and set up situations where students and teachers share in significant conversations.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> was <b>that,</b> {{shortly after}} the great discovery, he {{happened}} to make the acquaintance of the brilliant young evolutionist from London, and found to his surprise that on the whole most of their opinions agreed with remarkable unanimity. True, the young evolutionist was not a Gospel Evangelist, and did not feel any profound interest in the literal or mystical interpretation of {{the first chapter of}} Genesis. But in all essentials he was as deeply spiritual as Cyril Milliter himself; and the more Cyril saw of him and talked with him, the more did he begin to suspect that the truth may in reality have many facets, and that all men may not happen to see it in exactly the self-same aspect. It dawned upon him slowly that all the illumination in the world might not be entirely confined to the narrow circle of the Gospel Evangelists. Even those terrible evolutionists themselves, it seemed, were not necessarily wholly given over to cutting throats or robbing churches. They might have their desires and aspirations, their faith and their hope and their charity, exactly like other people, only perhaps in a slightly different and more definite direction. In the end, Cyril and his former bugbear became bosom friends, and both worked together amicably {{side by side in the}} self-same laboratory at the College of Science.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I devised plan after plan {{of getting}} more of it, {{but none of}} them would work. Two things were certain: One was that I could not get any more away by myself.

And <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> was <b>that</b> if I should try for any more of the treasure, I must have people to help me. The plan that suited me best was to buy a small vessel, man it, go down there, load up with the gold, and sail away. There would be no {{reasonable}} chance that any one would be there to hinder me, and I would take in the cargo just as if it were guano, or anything else. Then I would go boldly to Europe. I have looked into the matter, and I have found <b>that</b> the best <b>thing</b> I can do, if I should get that gold, would be to transport it to Paris, where I could distribute it better than I could from any other point. But the trouble was, where could I get the crew to help me? I have four black men, and I think I could trust them, as far as honesty goes, but they would not be enough to work the ship, and I could not think of any white men with whom I would trust my life and that gold in the same vessel. But now they seemed to pop up right in front of me.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{years after}} graduating from Cal State Dominguez Hills, in 2007, Crookshank signed a {{professional}} contract with the Halifax Rainmen of the American Basketball Association (ABA). He immediately improved the team, averaging 20.5 points per game and earning All-Star honors. Crookshank instantly became well known around the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was considered a fan favorite and led the Rainmen in scoring {{in his first season}} with the team. However, on January 14, 2009, after Halifax moved to the Premier Basketball League (PBL), Crookshank was suspended for the season after criticizing team head coach Rick Lewis in the public after he had to play off the bench. The forward later said, [...] "I was very arrogant. It was me first and whoever second. I didn’t care about anybody but myself." [...] Rainmen owner Andre Levingston said Crookshank would later [...] "thank him for it." [...] The suspended player remarked, [...] "I lost my mother and this is probably <b>the</b> <b>second</b> worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> has happened to me in my life. But life goes on." [...] Despite this, he could attend his team's games and was paid. Off the court, he took part in community service and began speaking to children at schools about responsibility. Crookshank decided to return to the same team once he was reinstated and started playing under a new coach Les Berry. He was named PBL Defensive Player {{of the year by the}} end of the season and finished second in Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting. In 19 games, he averaged 14.5 points, 13.0 rebounds and 1.5 blocks.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s {{researchers}} Angela Fawcett and Rod Nicolson {{also supported}} {{the idea that}} dyslexia and other mental disabilities were caused by problems in the cerebellum. Their research focused {{on the role of}} the cerebellum in motor control and its effects on speech articulation, which could in turn lead to poor phonological representations. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> they focused on was the role of the cerebellum in the automatisation of learned tasks, which could affect the ability of an individual to form sound-letter correlations as easily as others, making it more difficult to read. Later research showed their first hypothesis to be unlikely, but did not disprove their second hypothesis. It also showed that while difficulty with balance associated with an impaired cerebellum could be found in individuals with dyslexia, it was also found within individuals having ADHD or intelligence impairment. Therefore, a direct correlation between dyslexia and balance was not clear.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} for Glorydaze, Rick Roberts recalled {{what was going}} on at this time: [...] "Our business managers at that time were Dottie Ross and Mick Schneider, who operated as D&M Management. Although we didn't know it, it would appear that Mick Schneider had his own designs on managing the band. I can't really prove that, but he had been filling the gap as our defacto manager ever since we had parted company with our last official guy and he was getting pretty comfortable calling the shots. Mick Fleetwood got interested in taking over after we had been touring as an opening act for Fleetwood Mac on their Rumours tour. We entered into a spoken agreement with him and he went to work restructuring our recording contract with Atlantic Records. Things happened during that time that made it an unworkable arrangement. The first thing probably went a good way towards undermining any chance of a healthy working relationship with Mick. The band went to his house in Bel Air, California one day to try and hash out a written agreement. It was summertime, so we all went out and sat down around the pool. Present were {{all the members of the}} band as well as Mick, his road manager and confidant John Courage and his lawyer, Nick Shapiro. As we started to go through the proposed contract, the band started to function in their usual fashion; disputing every second word and generally being impossible to deal with. We had a very bad habit of that in almost all our business dealings. We also seemed to find a way to make the very worst possible decision at every opportunity. It took us about two hours of haggling to get through the first seven or so paragraphs. Mick's lawyer was obviously getting frustrated by the nit picking and we were all getting a little short tempered. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> happened was a lot more serious and probably dealt the killing blow. After Mick had gotten Atlantic to agree to restructure our contract with a sizable cash advance ($500,000 I think) and an increase in the percentage points, Mick Schneider rejected it as not being satisfactory! At that point, Mick (Fleetwood) decided that maybe managing Firefall was not in his best interests. As a result, we went for about another year and a half without an official manager and Mick Schneider stayed in nominal control. We were not the easiest band to work with at any time and considering the fatigue factor, we were probably raging jerks and for all the chart success we had achieved, we were hardly making a decent living. We were mostly serving as an opening act on a lot of 'A' list tours, and as such, we weren't being paid like a band with an unbroken string of gold and platinum albums and more than a half dozen straight top fifty singles. It was nice to be doing shows in sold out arenas every night, but going home after the tour was over with hardly anything in your pocket dulled the thrill a little. That only increased the tension in the band".|$|E

[...] "I don't really care what all the people say, I just do my work. I do what I know, to be honest. I am here because Red Bull just asked me to, as I do Formula 3 or World Series or GP2, I don't care. I just drive the cars. That's my job and that's what I enjoy doing in life.

40|$|When {{considering}} {{the security of}} a system, the analyst must simultaneously work with two types of properties: those that can be shown to be true, and those that must be argued as being true. The first consists of properties that can be demonstrated conclusively, such as the type of encryption in use or the existence of an authentication scheme. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> consists of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> cannot be so demonstrated but must be considered true for a system to be secure, such as the trustworthiness of a public key infrastructure or the willingness of people to keep their passwords secure. The choices represented by <b>the</b> <b>second</b> case are called trust assumptions, and the analyst should supply arguments explaining why the trust assumptions are valid. The chapter will present a process for security requirements elicitation and analysis, based around the construction of a satisfaction argument for {{the security of a}} system. The process starts with the enumeration of security goals based on assets in the system, then uses these goals to derive security requirements in the form of constraints.

50|$|After 7 {{years in}} the Premier Division the Club {{prepared}} for its first experience in the First Division. The committee {{decided that it was}} important to focus on the financial aspect and not on the team. This made the team weak and by the end of the season, the team only took 2 draws. One has to remember a fine 3-0 win against league winners Balzan Youths which was overturned by the protest board, where the board never found the Club guilty of anything. Although it was a very difficult season, three important things were achieved. First the club started to see the end of the dark tunnel when it comes to financial difficulties, and slowly but surely the club started to get on better financial footing. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> important <b>thing</b> was <b>that</b> due to the financial difficulties a lot of youngsters from the Club’s Nursery started joining the first squad and made their debuts during this season.
