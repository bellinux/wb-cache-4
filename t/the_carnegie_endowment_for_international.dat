50|$|Since its {{creation}} in 1923, The Hague Academy of International Law has occupied premises at the Peace Palace. Next to the Peace Palace building the Academy’s facilities include the Academy Hall built for international conferences, the Peace Palace Library {{as well as}} further administrative accommodations. The new buildings were planned and realized by architects Michael Wilford and Manuel Schupp.Alongside The Hague Academy of International Law the Peace Palace houses highest judicial {{institutions such as the}} International Court of Justice and the Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration. In the context of the movement for the establishment of peace through law, the idea of creating an Academy of International Law was mooted at the Hague Conference in 1907 (having previously been voiced by the Institut de Droit International as early as 1873). The Dutch Government took up the idea, and the International Law Association in turn examined the question. The Dutch Lawyer Tobias M. C. Asser proposed a plan that envisaged more or less what the Academy was to become, with courses held from July to October. Asser received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1911 and contributed a part of the prize money to the Academy; and <b>the</b> <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Endowment</b> <b>for</b> Peace provided a valuable contribution to get it started. The inauguration of the Academy was planned for October 1914. But World War I broke out, and preparations could not be resumed until 1921. When the Summer Courses started on 14 July 1923, at the Peace Palace in The Hague, 353 students originating from 31 countries attended, of whom 35 were women.|$|R

40|$|Summary: In this {{lecture at}} ANU, Professor Stephen Walt {{explains}} why China 2 ̆ 7 s rise {{will lead to}} increased security competition in Asia and explores {{the implications of this}} trend for United States alliance relations in this region. Sino-American competition is inevitable because the world 2 ̆ 7 s two strongest powers invariably cast a wary eye on each other. Moreover, it is in China 2 ̆ 7 s long-term interest to reduce the U. S. security presence in Asia. The U. S. will resist such efforts, however, because it does not want China to become a "regional hegemon" or establish a dominant "sphere of influence" in its immediate neighbourhood. Assuming Chinese power continues to grow, therefore, security competition between Washington and Beijing will be nearly impossible to avoid. Indeed, evidence of a growing rivalry is already apparent. The United States is already moving to shore up its alliance relations throughout Asia, but managing these relations will be a much more demanding task than managing NATO was during the Cold War. The distances are vast, which magnifies problems of collective action, and America 2 ̆ 7 s Asian partners are increasingly torn between their economic ties with Beijing and their security relations with Washington. There are also lingering resentments between key U. S. allies such as South Korea and Japan, which makes it harder for Washington to lead a powerful balancing coalition. This situation will place a premium on diplomatic skill and in-depth regional expertise, and the United States and its Asian partners will have to work hard to avoid a number of significant pitfalls over the next few decades.

He previously taught at Princeton University and the University of Chicago, been a Resident Associate of <b>the</b> <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Endowment</b> <b>for</b> Peace and a Guest Scholar at the Brookings Institution.
