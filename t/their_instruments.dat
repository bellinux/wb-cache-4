This video is shown on a small on-stage television screen at live shows, including the band's 2008 Viva la Vida tour.|$|E
5|$|Although civilizations in Central America {{attained}} {{a relatively high}} level of sophistication by the eleventh century AD, they lagged behind other civilizations {{in the development of}} musical instruments. For example, they had no stringed instruments; all of <b>their</b> <b>instruments</b> were idiophones, drums, and wind instruments such as flutes and trumpets. Of these, only the flute was capable of producing a melody. In contrast, pre-Columbian South American civilizations in areas such as modern-day Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile were less advanced culturally but more advanced musically. South American cultures of the time used pan-pipes as well as varieties of flutes, idiophones, drums, and shell or wood trumpets.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} production team IKIOI. It opens with a birds-eye view shot from the ground, showing several buildings and trees; just before the first verse, a short shot of Amuro is seen. The first verse opens with Amuro walking down a street in Los Angeles, California, singing to the track. During the verse, intercut scenes include various shadows of children holding instruments behind Amuro. The chorus opens with Amuro walking down along a bridge with the children playing <b>their</b> <b>instruments</b> behind her. When the second chorus starts, the camera pans over to several buildings and landscapes around Los Angeles. The camera then pans into several individuals citizens in the city: an elderly couple, {{a man in his}} car, a couple who have just finished surfing, and a woman walking her dog.|$|E

5|$|Blanche Rosalie Slaughter {{was born}} in 1876 in Lynchburg, Virginia to Mary Harker and John Flavel Slaughter. She had five {{brothers}} and one sister (three other siblings died in childhood), and was educated in Lynchburg before travelling to a finishing school in Baltimore. As a child, she occasionally assisted her two older brothers, who were doctors, on their house visits or by sterilising <b>their</b> <b>instruments,</b> and also attended to pets in her neighbourhood. Following {{the death of her}} father, who had strongly opposed her desire to become a doctor, she joined the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1893 using money saved from her childhood allowance.|$|E
5|$|Butthole Surfers {{began to}} take the {{collection}} of visual equipment seriously following Coffey's recruitment in 1983, when he added a clear plastic drum fitted with a strobe light to their show. Shortly afterwards, the band purchased what was reported as several thousand dollars worth of stolen strobe lights at a bargain rate, and their visual equipment soon took up more space than <b>their</b> <b>instruments.</b> Smoke machines were later added. Equally memorable was the band's propensity for projecting a variety of films behind them as they played, beginning with one 16-millimeter projector, before adding others. This set-up allowed them to play a number of overlapping movies {{at the same time}} which were often strangely angled, upside down or played in reverse. Combined with the increasing number of strobe lights, the effect created a visually disorienting atmosphere, which occasionally caused epileptic seizures in audience members.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Amuro and the {{children}} start marching and playing <b>their</b> <b>instruments</b> through downtown Los Angeles. The individuals walking in Los Angeles stop for a moment, and look towards the sky, which is cut off screen. As close-up shots of Amuro finish {{by the end of}} the bridge section of the song, the camera pans towards rainbow-coloured clouds, which puts all the citizens in surprise and glee. The final chorus has Amuro {{and the children}} dancing and singing at Pershing Square, surrounding by several lighting effects and rainbow-coloured clouds. Several scenes of the clouds start to float within the city, above and near skyscrapers, and the video ends with Amuro, the children, and the citizens smiling.|$|E

5|$|The {{materials}} used in making musical instruments vary greatly by culture and application. Many of the materials have special significance owing to their source or rarity. Some cultures worked substances from the human body into <b>their</b> <b>instruments.</b> In ancient Mexico, for example, the material drums were made from might contain actual human body parts obtained from sacrificial offerings. In New Guinea, drum makers would mix human blood into the adhesive used to attach the membrane. Mulberry trees are held in high regard in China owing to their mythological significance—instrument makers would hence use them to make zithers. The Yakuts believe that making drums from trees struck by lightning gives them a special connection to nature.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on <b>their</b> <b>instruments.</b> However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} {{centered}} on Maroon 5 playing in a dimly-lit house/factory. Throughout {{the course of the}} video, items such as darts on a dart board, candles, pictures, and even members of the band with <b>their</b> <b>instruments</b> are shown fading in and out. Towards the end of the video, Adam Levine is seen walking through a narrow corridor dragging a guitar with pictures {{on both sides of the}} wall fading in and out. When he reaches the end of the corridor, he is face to face with a wall with a small light coming out of it and then flings his guitar backwards and then pounds on the wall. The camera then quickly moves to a scene of the band playing and the lights suddenly flickering on.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Aboriginal peoples {{used the}} {{materials}} at hand to make <b>their</b> <b>instruments</b> for centuries before Europeans immigrated to Canada. First Nations people made gourds and animal horns into rattles, which were elaborately carved and brightly painted. In woodland areas, they made horns of birch bark and drumsticks of carved antlers and wood. Traditional percussion instruments such as drums were generally made of carved wood and animal hides. These musical instruments provide the background for songs, and songs the background for dances. Traditional First Nations people consider {{song and dance}} to be sacred. For years after Europeans came to Canada, First Nations people were forbidden to practice their ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Months went {{by without}} any {{scheduled}} concerts {{due to the}} album's poor sales. Following another relapse and a stint in rehab, Kiedis {{and the rest of}} the band prepared for a summer tour, their first in almost seven months. Before the tour could begin, Kiedis had an accident on his motorcycle and was rushed to the hospital after severely injuring his hand. Due to his drug addiction, it took seven doses of morphine before the pain was assuaged. Following discharge from the hospital, he was forced to wear a full-arm cast for several months, resulting in the cancellation of all remaining scheduled concerts. Halfway through Kiedis's recovery, the band was asked to play the Fuji Rock Festival in July 1997. By that time, Kiedis's cast had receded down to the elbow and he felt well enough to play. A large typhoon had been forecast to hit the festival several hours before the show. The concert took place anyway, and when the Chili Peppers got on stage to play, the audience was being soaked in torrential rains, and the band found it virtually impossible to play <b>their</b> <b>instruments.</b> After eight songs, the lighting and sound equipment was torn from the stage and the band was obliged to an impromptu finish.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the sound of a ticking clock and Levine and Rihanna sitting {{opposite}} each other at a table, tapping their hands and staring at one and other. As the songs audio begins to play, band members of Maroon 5 start to play <b>their</b> <b>instruments</b> as Rihanna sits and watches them. The table and band scenes are intercut with each other for the first verse and chorus. For the second verse, Levine and Rihanna appear to argue and try to ignore the other's advances. Rihanna lays suggestively on a bed while Levine sits on a chair with his head turned in the opposite direction for the bridge. For the final chorus, the pair appear to reconcile, ending with Levine finally giving in to his temptations and walk {{to the end of the}} table where Rihanna sits and he caresses her neck causing Rihanna to lean towards him seductively and the two nearly kiss as the video ends. The video was made available to download digitally via iTunes on May 12, 2008.|$|E

5|$|Yoshiki's songwriting {{process is}} unusual in that he writes scores for everything, {{including}} guitar and drums, before beginning to play it with the band. Although changes are made if necessary. His composing style tends {{to make use of}} chords in sequences of eights or more with riff-based motifs or call-and-response style phrasing. He has maintained this style for the majority of his career as a composer. Having played classical piano since he was four years old, Yoshiki claims to be as influenced by classical music as he is by rock. While also serving as the main songwriter Yoshiki has production credit on much of X Japan's later material. During live performances the band relies, for the most part, on its members (with drummer and pianist Yoshiki and guitarist and violinist Sugizo switching between <b>their</b> <b>instruments)</b> and prerecorded tracks for orchestrated strings, spoken word passages, and more recently, some of hide's guitar parts.|$|E
5|$|Stations in Paradip and Bhubaneswar each {{recorded}} sustained {{winds of}} 150km/h (90mph) before <b>their</b> <b>instruments</b> failed. Winds of 175km/h (110mph) were measured in Puri as the cyclone {{passed to the}} north. The strong winds damaged electric lines and uprooted trees over 50years old in Puri and Kendrapada. Downed power lines across the state cut off communications between Odisha {{and the rest of}} the world for over 24hours and caused widespread power outages. According to the Southern Electricity Supply Corporation, damage to the power grid caused by the cyclone totaled ₹330million (US$4.4million). Stalling over land, the Odisha cyclone dropped torrential rainfall, with 24-hour rainfall rates at times exceeding 20cm (7.9in); Paradip documented 53cm (20.9in) over one 24-hour period. Over the course of the storm's passage, total rainfall amounts over 60cm (23.6in) occurred over a large swath of Odisha. The highest recorded rainfall total was documented in Oupada, which measured 95.5cm (37.60in) of rain over a three-day period. Flooding caused by the storm was estimated to have killed approximately 2,000people. The heavy rains flattened thatched huts and damaged roads and other infrastructure. Within the seven worst affected districts, over 70%of homes were destroyed; most of these were thatched homes, though 10–15%of non-thatch roofed homes were also destroyed. Approximately 11,000schools were either significantly damaged or destroyed. All major district roads in the area were either washed out or blocked by felled trees. In Bhubaneswar, 60%of trees were flattened by the winds and rain; aerial surveys revealed that the entire city was submerged by floodwaters. Adjacent areas were nearly stripped of all tree cover. Until 8November, the city remained without power. The inundation induced by the far-reaching storm surge and heavy rain kept Konark submerged in knee-deep water for six days after landfall. Over the course of four days, the excessive rainfall caused the flooding of the Baitarani, Brahmani, Budhabalanga, Kharasua, and Salandi rivers, resulting in 20,005flood embankment breaches and the damaging of 6headworks. Thousands of people suffered chemical burns after the flooding mixed industrial chemicals into bathing ponds. Oswal Chemicals and Fertilisers, which maintained the world's largest diammonium phosphate plant, reported severe damage to the facility. In the five Odishan districts most affected, all electric water pumps were disabled, though hand pumps remained operable.|$|E
