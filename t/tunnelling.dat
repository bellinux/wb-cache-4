5|$|In 1883, the Duke of Buckingham {{planned to}} upgrade the route to main line {{standards}} and extend the line to Oxford, creating the shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford. Despite {{the backing of the}} wealthy Ferdinand de Rothschild, investors were deterred by costly <b>tunnelling.</b> In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed in which the line would be built to a lower standard and avoid <b>tunnelling.</b> In anticipation, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad.|$|E
5|$|Operations {{along the}} Vimy Ridge were {{accompanied}} by extensive underground excavations. The Arras–Vimy sector was conducive to <b>tunnelling</b> owing to the soft, porous yet extremely stable nature of the chalk underground. Underground warfare had been conducted on the Vimy sector since 1915. Bavarian engineers had blown twenty mines in the sector by March 1915. By early 1916, German miners had gained an advantage over their French counterparts. British <b>tunnelling</b> companies of the Royal Engineers took over progressively from the French between February and May 1916.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{specialist}} units were also raised, including three Australian <b>tunnelling</b> companies. Arriving on the Western Front in May 1916 they undertook mining and counter-mining operations alongside British, Canadian and New Zealand companies, initially operating around Armentieres and at Fromelles. The following year they operated in the Ypres section. In November 1916, the 1st Australian <b>Tunnelling</b> Company took {{over from the}} Canadians around Hill 60, subsequently playing {{a key role in}} the Battle of Messines in June 1917. During the German offensive in March 1918 the three companies served as infantry, and later supported the Allied advance being used to defuse booby traps and mines. The Australian Electrical Mining and Mechanical Boring Company supplied electric power to units in the British Second Army area.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Applied FLUENT {{simulation}} software {{to research the}} influence of <b>tunnel</b> length, <b>tunnel</b> entrance velocity, <b>tunnel</b> equivalent diameter and <b>tunnel</b> buried depth four important factors on the <b>tunnel</b> wind cooling system in Shenyang area. The results show that, {{with the increase of}} <b>tunnel</b> length and <b>tunnel</b> buried depth and with the decrease of <b>tunnel</b> entrance velocity and <b>tunnel</b> equivalent diameter, the outdoor air which passed into the <b>tunnel</b> cooling amplitude increases. For the <b>tunnel</b> wind cooling system optimization design in Shenyang area and the surrounding areas, the advices are that <b>tunnel</b> buried depth should not be more than 6 m and <b>tunnel</b> entrance velocity should not be more than 5 m/s...|$|R
5|$|In the far {{future of}} the universe, {{assuming}} that proton decay does not occur, cold fusion occurring via quantum <b>tunnelling</b> would cause the light nuclei in ordinary matter to fuse into 56Fe nuclei. Fission and alpha-particle emission would then make heavy nuclei decay into iron, converting all stellar-mass objects to cold spheres of pure iron.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tunnelling</b> {{began in}} September 1903. Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. Each station was provided with two or four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft.|$|E
5|$|From 1869 at the latest, {{the company}} owning the Walker Engine Works was Bells, Goodman & Co. In that year the firm made the <b>tunnelling</b> shield and iron {{castings}} to line the Tower subway tunnels. In 1871 the firm made pumping and winding engines for Seghill Colliery. In 1875 it made machinery to condense smoke and gases for Clyde Lead Works of Glasgow.|$|E

5|$|Geneva and {{the nearby}} French {{department}} of Ain co-host the world's largest laboratory, CERN, dedicated to particle physics research. Another important research centre is the Paul Scherrer Institute. Notable inventions include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), diazepam (Valium), the scanning <b>tunnelling</b> microscope (Nobel prize) and Velcro. Some technologies enabled the exploration of new worlds such as the pressurised balloon of Auguste Piccard and the Bathyscaphe which permitted Jacques Piccard to reach the deepest point of the world's oceans.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, the Duke of Buckingham {{announced}} plans to upgrade the route to main line railway standards and extend the line to Oxford, creating a through route from Aylesbury to Oxford. If built, the line {{would have been the}} shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford at the time. Despite the backing of the wealthy Ferdinand de Rothschild, investors were deterred by the costly <b>tunnelling</b> proposed, and the Duke was unable to raise sufficient funds. In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed, in which the line would be built to a lower standard and wind around hills to avoid <b>tunnelling.</b> In anticipation of this, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad. Although the existing line was upgraded in 1894, the extension to Oxford was never built. Instead, the operation of the Brill Tramway was taken over by London's Metropolitan Railway, and Brill became one of their two north-western termini. The line was rebuilt a second time in 1910, and more advanced locomotives were introduced, allowing trains to run faster.|$|E
5|$|Royal Engineer <b>tunnelling</b> {{companies}} were formed {{in response to}} the German blowing of 10 small mines in December 1914, at Givenchy. The first British mine was detonated at Hill 60 on 17 February 1915. Mining was used increasingly during the Battle of Aubers Ridge in May 1915, and the battle of Loos in September 1915. In July 1916, {{on the first day of}} the battle of the Somme, what became known as the Lochnagar Crater was created by a mine at La Boisselle.|$|E
50|$|The Mersey <b>Tunnels</b> connect Liverpool {{with the}} Wirral Peninsula, under the River Mersey.

5|$|The {{exhumation}} of Yagan's head eventually proceeded, without Colbung's knowledge, by excavating {{six feet}} {{down the side}} of the grave, then <b>tunnelling</b> horizontally to the location of the box. Thus the exhumation was performed without disturbing any other remains. The following day, a forensic palaeontologist from the University of Bradford positively identified the skull as Yagan's by correlating the fractures with those described in Pettigrew's report. The skull was then kept at the museum until 29 August, when it was handed over to the Liverpool City Council.|$|E
5|$|This method {{worked well}} for digging soft dirt and gravel near the street surface. However, <b>tunnelling</b> shields were {{required}} for deeper sections, such as the Harlem and East River tunnels, which used cast-iron tubes. Rock or concrete-lined tunnels were used on segments from 33rd to 42nd streets under Park Avenue; 116th to 120th Streets under Broadway; 145th to Dyckman Streets (Fort George) under Broadway and St. Nicholas Avenue; and 96th Street and Broadway to Central Park North and Lenox Avenue.|$|E
5|$|With funding obtained, <b>tunnelling</b> for the CCE {{was carried}} out between September 1903 and December 1905, after which the station {{buildings}} and fitting-out of the tunnels commenced.

5|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century it was clear that Gibraltar could be bombarded with {{relative}} impunity from the Spanish mainland. Proposals were put forward to build a new harbour {{on the east side of}} the Rock, where ships would be less vulnerable to direct artillery fire from the mainland, but were abandoned due to the vast expense and only marginal gains in security. A new round of <b>tunnelling</b> was carried out to provide more bombproof accommodation for the garrison, along with deep shelters and casemates capable of accommodating 2,000 men. Ultimately it was decided in 1906 that Gibraltar faced no credible threat from land and that the defences would be organised to deal with a threat from the sea.|$|E
5|$|Charles Pearson (1793–1862) had {{proposed}} an underground railway connecting the City of London {{with the main}} line rail termini in around 1840. In 1854 he commissioned the first traffic survey, determining that each day 200,000 walked into the City, 44,000 travelled by omnibus, and 26,000 in private carriages. A Parliamentary Commission backed Pearson's proposal over other schemes. Despite concerns about vibration causing subsidence of buildings, the problems of compensating the many thousands whose homes were destroyed during digging of the tunnel, and fears that the <b>tunnelling</b> might break into Hell, construction began in 1860. On 9January 1863 the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{concerns}} about vibrations causing subsidence of nearby buildings, {{the problems of}} compensating the many thousands of people whose homes were destroyed during the digging of the tunnel, and fears that the <b>tunnelling</b> might accidentally break through into Hell, construction began in 1860.
