500|$|During stints in {{different}} musical groups, Dawn Richard wanted to develop her musical identity and pursue a solo recording career. In 2011, Richard was promoting the album Last Train to Paris (2010) {{as a member}} of Sean Combs' musical project Diddy – Dirty Money and released a free mixtape, The Prelude to A <b>Tell</b> <b>Tale</b> Heart, which registered one million downloads within a month. After the group disbanded in 2012, she worked with producer, manager, and creative partner Andrew [...] "Druski" [...] Scott and released her EP Armor On, which sold 30,000 copies. Richard also marketed herself through social media and self-funded music videos on YouTube. Goldenheart is the first of a planned trilogy of albums by Richard about love, loss, and redemption; it will be followed by BlackHeart and RedemptionHeart. She wrote songs for the albums over the course of six years. Some were written as ten-minute songs and instrumentals, but Richard edited them down to avoid being [...] "long-winded" [...] and [...] "overwhelming".|$|E
