5|$|Dexter {{receives}} a voice message from his foster sister Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter), {{a police officer}} in the vice department and, Dexter believes, the only person who loves him. Debra says she is at a crime scene and wants him to be there, because she needs his help. Dexter arrives and Debra, undercover as a prostitute, informs him that another hooker has been killed, the third in five months. Dexter inspects the victim and is shocked to learn that <b>the</b> <b>chopped</b> up corpse is bloodless. Dexter leaves, awed by the killer's technique, and says that {{due to the lack of}} blood he can't help out. At the police station, Dexter discusses another murder case being handled by James Doakes (Erik King), who hates Dexter and suspects he is hiding something. Dexter suggests that it was a crime of passion, rather than the bad drug deal Doakes believes it to be. Dexter surveils Jamie Jaworski, a murderer who escaped justice due to a faulty warrant, and breaks into his home to find proof of his crime. Once he confirms that Jaworski is guilty, Dexter meets with his girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), a domestic violence victim. Because of her violent past with her husband, Rita has no interest in sex, and Dexter secretly feels comfortable with the lack of intimacy. Rita has two young children, Astor and Cody, whom Dexter genuinely feels for. While on a date with Rita, Dexter finds another crime scene in which the victim has been cut into pieces with no traces of blood; this time, however, the head is missing. Dexter theorizes that the killer murders his victims in extreme cold, explaining the absence of blood. Dexter further suggests that a stolen refrigerated truck is being used for the murders. Dexter allows Debra to pitch the theory, but their superior officer, Lt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez), who dislikes Debra, dismisses it.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years of hip hop, the DJs were the stars, as they created new music and beats with their record players. While DJing and turntablism {{continue}} to be used in hip hop music in the 2010s, the star role has increasingly been taken by MCs since the late 1970s, due to innovative, creative MCs such as Kurtis Blow and Melle Mel of Grandmaster Flash's crew, the Furious Five, who developed strong rapping skills. However, a number of DJs have gained stardom nonetheless in recent years. Famous DJs include Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, Mr. Magic, DJ Jazzy Jeff, DJ Scratch from EPMD, DJ Premier from Gang Starr, DJ Scott La Rock from Boogie Down Productions, DJ Pete Rock of Pete Rock & CL Smooth, DJ Muggs from Cypress Hill, Jam Master Jay from Run-DMC, Eric B., DJ Screw from the Screwed Up Click and the inventor of <b>the</b> <b>Chopped</b> & Screwed style of mixing music, Funkmaster Flex, Tony Touch, DJ Clue, Mix Master Mike, Touch-Chill-Out, DJ Red Alert, and DJ Q-Bert. The underground movement of turntablism has also emerged to focus on the skills of the DJ. In the 2010s, there are turntablism competitions, where turntablists demonstrate advanced beat juggling and scratching skills.|$|E
500|$|Herren {{described}} the album {{as an attempt}} to bridge hip hop instrumentals with vocal-orientated hip hop tracks, saying that <b>the</b> <b>chopped</b> and edited raps were [...] "another layer of music" [...] and that he was [...] "into creating a whole new mangled language [...] it's a form of communication without communicating, a new flow when you feel like you're listening to a standard hip hop track but there's something in it that's not right." [...] The cut-up vocals were also described by Herren as a tribute to Miami bass music and the group Mantronix. Herren said: [...] "Old school dirty south and booty shake shit, just the way stuff was edited back then, all the bass music and edit records... that's what inspired me. I wanted to make edit records, but bring all the shit that happened afterwards into it, hip hop from the early 90s through the present day." [...] The song [...] "Nuno" [...] features chopped-up vocals with only the phrase [...] "fuck words of wisdom" [...] intelligible; the title is a reference to the Portuguese musician Nuno Canavarro, whose 1988 album Plux Quba also features manipulated vocals including randomly-reassembled tapes of children singing. Herren used a sample from Canavarro's song [...] "Wask" [...] for [...] "Nuno".|$|E

50|$|Looking at {{how these}} tools are made is an {{important}} part in the history of <b>the</b> <b>Chopping</b> Tool. A large hard stone was needed as well as a softer stone that would be made into the chopper. The soft stone was commonly basalt (volcanic rock). The large hard stone acted as a hammer as it was hit against the soft stone. The soft stone would begin to chip away. The maker of <b>the</b> <b>chopping</b> tool would use the hard stone to create the edges and point needed to make <b>the</b> <b>chopping</b> tool efficient.

[...] Stylus rated it A saying : [...] "It’s a wonderfully eclectic mixture of fingers-down-a-blackboard avant-punk (“Voices (On The Air),” “Eve White/Eve Black”), Creatures-esque tribal drum-worship (“Sunless”), majestic beauty (“Something Blue,” “Shooting Sun,” “Return”), amusing experimentation (“Slap Dash Snap,” “(There’s A) Planet In My Kitchen”), linguistic fun (“Mittageisen,” “Il Est Ne, Le Divin Enfant,” “El Dia De Los Muertos”) and, yes, playfully ‘dark’ tunes (“Something Wicked (This Way Comes),” “Are You Still Dying, Darling?”)." [...] Record Collector praised the box set for its [...] "remarkable diversity, spontaneity and playfulness", considering that there are [...] "No throwaway tracks". Critic Murray Chalmers noted: [...] ""Drop Dead/Celebration" [...] is still a wonderful explosion of bile aimed at their absconded guitarist and drummer, while Slap Dash Snap is prototype techno." [...] She underlined {{the diversity of the}} material: [...] "on more reflective tracks like Sea Of Light and Let Go you feel that here is a group who could go anywhere". She then stated: [...] "By CD2 they are firing on all cylinders, a pop group thrillingly ahead of the pack, CD3 is immaculate." [...] and considered the four tracks of The Thorn that end the box set as an [...] "orchestrated EP of ferocious intensity". Rock Sound shared a similar point of view and said: [...] "Whilst most bands regard the B-side as an irrelevancy, a dumping ground for throwaway tracks not deemed good enough for proper release, Siouxsie And The Banshees always treated it with respect, an excuse to have fun and experiment."

40|$|Upon {{exposure}} to environmental stress, phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF 2 (eIF 2 α-P) represses global protein synthesis, coincident with preferential translation of gene transcripts that mitigate stress damage or alternatively trigger apoptosis. Because {{there are multiple}} mammalian eIF 2 kinases, each responding to different stress arrangements, this translational control scheme {{is referred to as}} the integrated stress response (ISR). Included among the preferentially translated mRNAs induced by eIF 2 α-P is that encoding <b>the</b> transcription factor <b>CHOP</b> (DDIT 3 /GADD 153). Enhanced levels of CHOP promote cell death when ISR signaling is insufficient to restore cell homeostasis. Preferential translation of CHOP mRNA occurs by a mechanism involving ribosome bypass of an inhibitory upstream ORF (uORF) situated in the 5 '-leader of <b>the</b> <b>CHOP</b> mRNA. In this study, we used biochemical and genetic approaches to define the inhibitory features of <b>the</b> <b>CHOP</b> uORF and <b>the</b> biological consequences of loss of <b>the</b> <b>CHOP</b> uORF on CHOP expression during stress. We discovered that specific sequences within <b>the</b> <b>CHOP</b> uORF serve to stall elongating ribosomes and prevent ribosome reinitiation at <b>the</b> downstream <b>CHOP</b> coding sequence. As a consequence, deletion of <b>the</b> <b>CHOP</b> uORF substantially increases the levels and modifies the pattern of induction of <b>CHOP</b> expression in <b>the</b> ISR. Enhanced <b>CHOP</b> expression leads to increased expression of key CHOP target genes, culminating in increased cell death in response to stress...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedComputer based tools {{were developed to}} search water wave data for a collective mode predicted by wave turbulence theory. A low frequency wave, the "swell", can drive the collective mode by compressing and expanding the field of high frequency waves, the "chop". Through non-linear interactions, <b>the</b> <b>chop</b> responds with its own collective stiffness and inertia. This inertia should cause modulations of <b>the</b> <b>chop</b> amplitude to lag in phase behind the forcing from the swell. Two methods are presented for investigating the phase relationships between <b>the</b> <b>chop</b> amplitude and <b>the</b> swell. Method one employs the Fast Fourier Transform to examine directly the power levels at various frequencies. Method two employs digital signal processing to separate <b>the</b> swell and <b>chop</b> frequencies and <b>the</b> Hubert Transform to compute the instantaneous phase of the swell and instantaneous amplitude of <b>the</b> <b>chop.</b> Various plotting techniques permit {{the examination of the}} relationships between the amplitude of <b>the</b> <b>chop</b> and <b>the</b> phase of the swell.
