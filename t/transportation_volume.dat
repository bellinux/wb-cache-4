40|$|Purpose: This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} mechanism of international oil {{price on the}} industrial carbon emission, and uses the partial least squares regression model to study international oil price’s impact on carbon emissions in China’s transportation industry. Design/methodology/approach: This paper chooses five independent variables of GDP (Gross Domestic Product), international oil price, private car population, passenger and freight <b>transportation</b> <b>volume</b> as impact factors to investigate industrial carbon emissions, the paper also analyses the impact mechanism of international oil price on the industrial carbon emission, and finally the paper uses the PLSR (partial least squares regression) model to study international oil price’s impact on carbon emissions in China’s transportation industry. With the independent variables ’ historical data from 1994 to 2011 as a sample, the fitting of the industry carbon emissions is satisfying. And based on the data of 2011, the paper maintains the private car owning, passenger and freight <b>transportation</b> <b>volume</b> to study international oil prices’ impact on the industry carbon emissions {{at different levels of}} GDP. Findings: The results show that: with the same GDP growth, the industry carbon emissions increase with the rise in international oil prices, and vice versa, the industry carbon emissions decrease; and lastly when GDP increases to a certain extent, in both cases of international oil prices ’ rise or fall, the industry carbon emissions will go up, and the industry carbon emissions increase even faster while the energy prices are rising. - 749 -Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management...|$|E
30|$|As the {{oil price}} {{influence}} on logistics structure is limited within the regarded range, the necessity of fundamental changes in logistics networks {{in the course of}} rising oil prices is questionable and depends on the current maturity of the network. Outcomes of high oil prices such as a general drop of demand seem to be of greater importance for the logistics structure than the rise in transportation costs. Therefore, the increase in transportation costs by 0.22 EUR per kilometer per oil price rise of 100  USD/bbl has to be analyzed considering the overall <b>transportation</b> <b>volume.</b> In the year 2008, road transport in Germany covered a distance of over 31.4 billion kilometers. An increment of {{the oil price}} of 10 USD would mean for Germany an increase of around 690  million EUR in transportation costs per year.|$|E

The ready to use buoyant segments, that assure the proper displacement, must have the factory leak-tightness. They take up a big <b>transportation</b> <b>volume</b> and need the assurance of the suitably abundant means of transport. Usually the heavy wheeled vehicles are needed because of high own mass of buoyant segment and large gauges. The exploitation of such constructions is very expensive.

The decrease of the single buoyant segment dimensions with the assurance of the capacity leads that more segments fit into in the same dimensions of the loading compartment of the vehicle and storage accommodation.

This research explores {{the impact of}} the oil price on the optimal degree of centralization of logistics networks through the fluctuation of transportation costs. The impact of the degree of centralization on greenhouse gas emissions of transportation is evaluated. Investigations are conducted by means of a model consisting of logistics network, logistics costs, carbon dioxide emissions and an empirically determined relationship of oil price, fuel price and transportation costs. First, the dependency of transportation costs in European road transports from oil prices is derived. Then, the optimal configuration of the logistics network is determined for a range of oil prices. Sensitivity analysis on the value of traded goods is performed. Results show an existing dependency of the European logistics network structure limited to oil prices above 150  USD/barrel. Dependency on the oil price increases for high-value goods compared to low-valued goods. Carbon dioxide emissions diminish with lower centralization degree, as an effect of lower total transport distance.|$|R

We consider a multi-period single allocation hub location problem with multiple capacity levels. Which locations serve as hubs, the capacity of these hubs and the allocation of non-hub locations to hub locations are the key decisions in each period. Several formulations of mixed integer programs for the multi-period model are proposed. We develop and evaluate heuristics to solve large-scale problems.
