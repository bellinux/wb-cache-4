This was patented as US Patent 6909273 in 2005. (Please also see reference 9.)

50|$|TSC {{has been}} used to study traps in semi-insulating gallium {{arsenide}} (GaAs) substrates. It has also been applied to materials used for particle detectors or semiconductor detectors used in nuclear research, for example, high-resistivity silicon, cadmium telluride (CdTe), etc. TSC has also been applied to various organic insulators. TSC is useful for electret research. More advanced modifications of TSC have been applied to study traps in ultrathin high-k dielectric thin films. W. S.

50|$|<b>Thermally</b> <b>stimulated</b> <b>current</b> (TSC) {{spectroscopy}} (not to {{be confused}} with Thermally Stimulated Depolarization Current) is an experimental technique which is used to study energy levels in semiconductors or insulators (organic or inorganic). Energy levels are first filled either by optical or electrical injection usually at a relatively low temperature, subsequently electrons or holes are emitted by heating to a higher temperature. A curve of emitted current will be recorded and plotted against temperature, resulting in a TSC spectrum. By analyzing TSC spectra, information can be obtained regarding energy levels in semiconductors or insulators.|$|E
50|$|There is an {{important}} shortcoming for DLTS: it cannot be used for insulating materials. (Note: an insulator {{can be considered as}} a very large bandgap semiconductor.) For insulating materials it is difficult or impossible to produce a device having a space region for which width could be changed by the external voltage bias and thus the capacitance measurement-based DLTS methods cannot be applied for the defect analysis. Basing on experiences of the <b>thermally</b> <b>stimulated</b> <b>current</b> (TSC) spectroscopy, the current transients are analyzed with the DLTS methods (I-DLTS), where the light pulses are used for the defect occupancy disturbance. This method in the literature is sometimes called the Photoinduced Transient Spectroscopy (PITS). I-DLTS or PITS are also used for studying defects in the i-region of a p-i-n diode.|$|E

Before the invention of DLTS (deep level transient spectroscopy), <b>thermally</b> <b>stimulated</b> <b>current</b> (TSC) spectroscopy was a popular technique to study traps in semiconductors.

(Note: an insulator can be considered as a very large bandgap semiconductor.) In addition, the standard transient capacitance based DLTS method may not be very good for the study of traps in the i-region of a p-i-n diode while the transient current based DLTS (I-DLTS) may be more useful.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT – The {{isothermal}} and the non-isothermal current {{released from}} a polarized/charged dielectric material is analyzed. The measured current {{is determined by the}} polarization charge and space charge and the main concern is dedicated to the situation when the process of the space charge de-trapping represents the main source of the measured current. The experimental measurements have been carried out on polyethylene terephthalate but the reported results are typical for a large class of materials.
