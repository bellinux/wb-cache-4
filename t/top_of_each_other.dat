5|$|In the Cretaceous, {{a shallow}} seaway spread into the {{interior}} of North America from the Gulf of Mexico in the south into Utah and later to the Arctic Ocean in the far north. Geologists call this shallow sea the Cretaceous Seaway or Western Interior Seaway. The seaway divided North America into two halves: an eastern portion dominated by the already ancient Appalachian Mountains and a western part composed primarily of the still growing Sevier Mountains; formed from shallow thrust faulting caused by the Sevier orogeny. As the shoreline moved back and forth, the Bryce area alternated from {{being part of the}} Sevier landmass to being under the Cretaceous Seaway.

Unable to ground his ship for fear of a shock that would set off his explosive cargo, Mackey ordered Mont-Blanc to steer hard to port (starboard helm) and crossed the Norwegian ship's bows in a last-second bid to avoid a collision. The two ships were almost parallel to each other, when Imo suddenly sent out three signal blasts, indicating the ship was reversing its engines. The combination of the cargoless ship's height {{in the water and}} the transverse thrust of her right-hand propeller caused the ship's head to swing into Mont-Blanc.

During the last 2 years such a 1350 tonnes concrete structure has been under detailed design in Norway. The construction was planned to be installed during spring and summer 2008 at a small island Kvitsoy situated near Stavanger. Unfortunately environmental issues have demanded a movement of the project to another location.

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19thcentury the {{population}} of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately , spread across around 200 small sites. The difficulty of digging without disturbing existing graves led to bodies often simply being stacked on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> to fit the available space and covered with a layer of earth. In more crowded areas even relatively fresh graves had to be exhumed to free up space for new burials, their contents being unearthed and scattered to free up space. In some cases large pits were dug on existing burial grounds, unearthing the previous burials, and fresh corpses crammed into the available space. Intact material from burials was sold on a thriving market in second hand coffin furniture, coffin wood was burned as household fuel, and exhumed bones were shipped in bulk to the north of England to be sold as fertiliser. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid; in 1842 the mean working life of a London professional man was 30 years and of a London labourer just 17 years.|$|E

She was able to elude the military’s brutality by swift action. Rufina Amaya’s four children were all taken away from her before the military proceeded with taking Mrs. Amaya and 22 other women up to a hill. Mrs. Rufina recounts how she saw a mountain of dead people stacked on <b>topped</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and at that moment she hurried to jump in a bush. Luckily for her sake, Mrs. Amaya was last in the line of women being taken to be executed. Mrs. Amaya remained in the bush throughout the whole night where she heard children and babies screaming in horror. Mrs. Amaya even stated that she heard a child say, “ Mama they are killing us!”. Mrs. Amaya then dug a hole where she screamed and then everything went silent. She was able to escape after that night. With the help of Mrs. Amaya the massacre did not go unheard. After being interviewed, her testimony made headlines in the Washington Post and the New York Times. After the story of the massacre was published, it made the investigation easier for the Truth Commission because the government could not interfere with the investigations. Also with the testimony of Mrs. Rufina Amaya the government and the military officers responsible for the massacre could not deny the genocide. Mrs. Rufina Amaya was of great contribution to the investigation of the El Mozote Massacre. Mrs. Amaya’s testimony was able to open doors and answer questions that were important to understand the massacre. Mrs. Amaya died at the age of 64 in 2007.|$|R

Non-volatile memories can retain the stored information even when not powered, and there are various solutions available in the market to serve the need of different applications: hard drives, magnetic tapes, compact disks, NAND and NOR flash memories, etc.. Among them, the most popular for mass data storage application are hard drives and NAND flash. Hard drive disks (HDDs) use spinning magnetic platters paired with magnetic head to read and write data. On the other hand NAND flash is a semiconductor memory entirely implemented in solid state circuits, and it does not require moving parts. Even if the cost per bit is relatively higher than HDDs, NAND flash has becoming a new driving force in the semiconductor industry over the last decade, thanks to its proven scalability, low power consumption and robustness, fundamental for portable systems. In order to overcome the scaling obstacle in conventional planar NAND Flash, 3 D NAND memory technology, has been introduced for mass production for the first time in 2014. The third dimension is exploited by stacking NAND cells on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other’s,</b> resulting not only in a significant bit‑density increase but also in a reduced cost-per-bit. The most industrial relevant channel material for 3 D NANDs is polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si). However, the conduction in poly‑Si channel is dominated by the grain size distribution and hampered by scattering events at grain boundaries and charged defects. As a consequence, the drive current (ID) required for reading operations, is low, unstable, and decreases as the number of stacked cells increases, rendering poly‑Si unsustainable for long‑term scaling. This thesis is an effort to investigate alternative channel materials with higher electron mobility than poly-Si, as a possible solution to enable further scaling for future 3 D NAND generations. status: publishe...|$|R

2500|$|According to Diana Magaloni, the Florentine Codex {{contains}} {{a variety of}} illustrations with multiple variations of the red pigments. Specifically {{in the case of}} achiotl (light red), technical analysis of the paint reveals multiple layers of the pigment although the layers of the pigment is not visible to the naked eye. Therefore, it proves that the process of applying multiple layers is more significant in comparison to the actual color itself. Furthermore, the process of layering the various hues of the same pigment on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> [...] <b>each</b> [...] <b>other</b> enabled the Aztec artists to create variations in the intensity of the subject matter. A bolder application of pigment draws the viewer’s eye to the subject matter which commands attention and suggests a power of the viewer.

It is sufficient to compare the beaks of the Guacharo and goat-sucker to conjecture how much their manners must differ.
