5|$|Monotype created several titling designs {{based on}} Renaissance {{printing}} {{that could be}} considered complementary to Bembo: Bembo Titling (based directly on Bembo's capitals, but more delicate to suit a larger <b>text</b> <b>size)</b> and the more geometric Felix Titling in 1934, inspired by humanist capitals drawn by Felice Feliciano in 1463. In the hot metal type era Monotype also issued a titling version of Centaur, which was often used by Penguin; Monotype's digitisations of Centaur do not include it.|$|E
5|$|Like all metal type revivals, {{reviving}} Gill Sans {{in digital}} form raises several decisions of interpretation, such as {{the issue of how}} to compensate for the ink spread that would have been seen in print at small sizes more than larger. As a result, printed Gill Sans and its digital facsimile may not always match. The digital release of Gill Sans, like many Monotype digitisations, has been criticised, in particular for excessively tight letter-spacing and lack of optical sizes: with only one design released that has to be used at any <b>text</b> <b>size,</b> it cannot replicate the subtlety of design and spacing of the metal type, for which every size was drawn differently. In the hot metal era the structure of the font varied by size as is normal for metal type, with wider spacing and other detail changes at smaller text sizes. In the phototype period Monotype continued to offer two or three sizes of master, but all of this subtlety was lost on transfer to digital. To replicate this, it is necessary to make manual adjustment to spacing to compensate for size changes, such as expanding the spacing and increasing the weight used at smaller sizes.|$|E
5|$|In November 2009 Cameron {{and others}} {{distributed}} free copies of an altered version of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species {{on college campuses}} in the United States. The book consisted of Darwin's text with chapters of the book removed, and with an added introduction by Ray Comfort reiterating common creationist assertions about Darwin and evolution. The book was criticized by scientists and Darwin biographers who criticized the omission of key chapters of the book, and who stated that its introduction contains misinformation about Darwin, and long-refuted creationist arguments about the science of evolution, such as the linking of Nazi racial theories to Darwinist ideas. Comfort later said that the four chapters were chosen at random to be omitted {{in order to make}} the book small enough to be affordable as a giveaway, with the absent chapters available for download, but that the missing chapters were included in the second edition, which had a smaller <b>text</b> <b>size</b> that made printing the entire book as a giveaway affordable. The second edition still lacks Darwin's preface and glossary of terms. The National Center for Science Education arranged a campaign to distribute an analysis of the Comfort introduction and a banana bookmark at colleges across the U.S., a reference to Comfort's presentation of the banana as an argument for the existence of God.|$|E

5000|$|Frutiger (pronounced {{with a hard}} g) is {{a series}} of typefaces named after its Swiss designer, Adrian Frutiger. Frutiger is a humanist {{sans-serif}} typeface, intended to be clear and highly legible at a distance or at small <b>text</b> <b>sizes.</b> A very popular design worldwide, type designer Steve Matteson described its structure as [...] "the best choice for legibility in pretty much any situation" [...] at small <b>text</b> <b>sizes,</b> while Erik Spiekermann named it as [...] "the best general typeface ever".|$|R
25|$|In human–{{computer}} interaction, computer accessibility (also {{known as}} accessible computing) {{refers to the}} accessibility of a computer system to all people, regardless of disability or severity of impairment, examples include web accessibility guidelines. Another approach is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal, such as a smart card, that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed, <b>text</b> <b>size,</b> etc. to their particular needs. This is useful where users want to access public computer based terminals in Libraries, ATM, Information kiosks etc. The concept is encompassed by the CEN EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface. This development of this standard has been supported in Europe by SNAPI and has been successfully incorporated into the Lasseo specifications, but with limited success {{due to the lack}} of interest from public computer terminal suppliers.|$|E
500|$|Jones also {{developed}} for Linotype Estienne, a delicate revival based on Robert Estienne's fonts of the 1530s discussed above, with very long ascenders and descenders, which was less popular; as of 2017 {{it has not}} been digitised by Linotype. [...] Williamson suggests that in body text it failed to adapt the style of a large letter effectively down to body <b>text</b> <b>size,</b> producing a design with an extremely small x-height.|$|E
500|$|This claim {{has been}} criticised as a {{misinterpretation}} of how typefaces are actually measured and what printing methods are desirable. Monotype Garamond, the version bundled with Windows, has a generally smaller design {{at the same}} notional point size compared to Times New Roman and quite spindly strokes, giving it a more elegant but less readable appearance. To make letters, especially the lower-case, as high as in an equivalent setting of Times New Roman, the <b>text</b> <b>size</b> must be increased, counterbalancing any cost savings. Thomas Phinney, an expert on digital fonts, noted {{that the effect of}} simply swapping Garamond in would be compromised legibility: [...] "any of those changes, swapping to a font that sets smaller at the same nominal point size, or actually reducing the point size, or picking a thinner typeface, will reduce the legibility of the text. That seems like a bad idea, as the percentage of Americans with poor eyesight is skyrocketing." [...] Professional font designer Jackson Cavanaugh commented [...] "If we're actually interested in reducing waste, just printing less – using less paper – is obviously more efficient." ...|$|E

For a moment I froze {{in front of the}} computer, {{thinking}} about writing a letter of complaint to the company for sending us the wrong font. After a while I checked the Bembo Italic and I slowly began to realise that the fonts were Bembo. I calmed down enough to recall that the typeface was originally designed for metal type, and most of the specimens and texts I saw were set in metal type in <b>text</b> <b>size.</b> That was why the images of the characters did not overlap. I knew that a metal typeface was cut or designed separately for each size, but a film composition or digital face is a kind of compromise having proportions designed for reduction and enlargement. I was overwhelmed to see the huge gap. Then I looked into the types used in Western offset-litho prints to see the digital Bembo types in use... the types that were originally designed for hot-metal often looked too light and feeble... Bembo Book is more or less what I expected." ...|$|E

50|$|As a {{somewhat}} precise design that emphasises contrast between {{thick and thin}} strokes, modern designers may prefer different revivals for different <b>text</b> <b>sizes,</b> printing methods and onscreen display, since a design intended to appear elegant in large <b>text</b> <b>sizes</b> could look too spindly for body text. Factors which would {{be taken into account}} include compensation for size and ink spread, if any (the extent of which depends on printing methods and type of paper used; it does not occur on screens). Among digitisations, František Štorm's extremely complete range of versions is particularly praised for featuring three optical <b>sizes,</b> the <b>text</b> version having thicker strokes to increase legibility as metal type does. Meanwhile, the common digitisation of Baskerville Old Face bundled with many Microsoft products features dramatic contrasts between thin and thick strokes. This makes it most suited to headings, especially since it does not have an italic.|$|R

50|$|The {{amount of}} letter-spacing in text affects legibility. Tight letter-spacing, {{especially}} in small <b>text</b> <b>sizes,</b> can diminish legibility. The addition of minimal letter-spacing can often increase the legibility and readability.
