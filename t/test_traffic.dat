5000|$|The Mu Service Analyzer is a {{commercial}} service testing tool developed by Mu Dynamics. The Mu Service Analyzer performs black box and white box {{testing of services}} based on their exposed software interfaces, using denial-of-service simulations, service-level traffic variations (to generate invalid inputs) and the replay of known vulnerability triggers. All these techniques exercise input validation and error handling and are {{used in conjunction with}} valid protocol monitors and SNMP to characterize the effects of the <b>test</b> <b>traffic</b> on the software system. The Mu Service Analyzer allows users to establish and track system-level reliability, availability and security metrics for any exposed protocol implementation.

The following year the company changed its name in Helsingin raitiotie- ja omnibussiosakeyhtiö (abbreviated HRO).

This paper describes a full scale testing research program that used a 20 kNmoving wheel load to determine the benefit of using a stiff biaxial geogrid between the base and subgrade of a flexible pavement system. The traffic benefit ratio (TBR) {{was defined as the}} ratio of the number of load cycles of a stiff geogrid reinforced section, to the number of load cycles of an unrein-forced section for a given level of performance. The TBR values ranged from 2 to over 10 for the conditions <b>tested.</b> <b>Traffic</b> benefit ratio values between 2 and 4 appear to be reasonable for use in pavement design...|$|R
