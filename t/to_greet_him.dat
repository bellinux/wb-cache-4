Olajuwon was not highly recruited and was merely offered {{a visit to the}} university to work out for the coaching staff, based on a recommendation from a friend of Lewis who had seen Olajuwon play. He later recalled that when he originally arrived at the airport in 1980 for the visit, no representative of the school was there <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>him.</b> When he called the staff, they told him to take a taxi out to the university.|$|E

5|$|The Orkneyinga Saga {{states that}} King William called upon the King of Mann, Ragnald Guthredsson, {{to fight against}} Harald. Rognvald had {{possibly}} spuriously claims to Harald's lands, because people remembered that Harald's mother was younger daughter of earl Haakon Paulsson, whereas the elder daughter had married the king of Isle of Man (although Ragnald's father Godfrey of Man had been that lady's stepson and not her own son). Harald, however, retook Caithness at this time. In this campaign, dated to 1201, the Saga tells that Harald came to the stronghold of Bishop John of Caithness, at Scrabster. Bishop John went to meet Harald, apparently <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>him,</b> but the Earl had him seized, tortured and mutilated. The Gesta Annalia reports that Harald tormented Bishop John in this way because he believed that John was an informant set on making trouble between Harald and King William.|$|E

5|$|Both of Coker's older {{brothers}} {{were involved in}} Scouting and Coker first became involved when he joined Cub Scouts in late 1951. He completed the Cubbing program and joined Troop 32. Troop 32 had about a dozen members at that time but had over 60 members when Coker made Eagle Scout in 1959. During this time the troop formed an Explorer Post and Sea Scout unit. After making Eagle Scout, Coker joined the Sea Scout unit and worked at summer camp before the joined the Navy in October 1963.

25|$|Banda was {{the subject}} of an {{extensive}} cult of personality.

Before every film, a video of Banda waving to the people was shown while the anthem played. When Banda visited a city, a contingent of women were expected <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>him</b> at the airport and dance for him.

25|$|Alice Mitchell, née Johnson — Dennis' stay-at-home mother Alice {{is usually}} the reassuring figure Dennis can run to when things get too overwhelming, ready <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>him</b> with a warm hug.
