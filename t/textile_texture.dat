40|$|A {{method of}} {{rotation}} and scale invariant texture recognition is proposed, {{which can also}} be employed for multi-object analysis and object recognition based on pattern analysis in noisy images. The recognition method uses data base textures, which are compared with a texture to be recognized and relies on extraction and classification of features. The features are extracted using multichannel polar logarithmic Gabor filtering of the data base textures and the texture to be recognized with the same definite filter bank. The polar logarithmic orientation of the Gabor filters guarantees rotation and scale invariance. The classification of the features is carried out by symmetric phase-only matched filtering. The performance of the method has been tested on Brodatz textures, hone <b>textures,</b> and <b>textile</b> <b>textures</b> with perfect recognition results.

40|$|Abstract: Besides {{of shape}} and color, texture {{is the most}} {{important}} characteristic of textile to be considered in bag design. What elements consist of textural image? Can we distinguish perceptual elements from affective elements in textural image? What is the relationship between these two elements? What is the relationship between textural images and physical features of fabrics? To answer these questions, this study was conducted. In this study, sixty fabrics commonly used in bags were adopted as testing samples. Based on literature reviews as well as experts ’ advice, twenty-two pairs of opposite adjectives were decided as scales for making semantic differential judgments on the sixty testing samples of fabrics by both male and female subjects, respectively. Through factor analysis on the collected data, the consisting elements of textural image were revealed. According to factors derived, an image space of <b>textile</b> <b>texture</b> was constructed. From a further series of factor analyses, the relationship between perceptual and affective elements in textural image has been concluded. The analyses of multiple linear regression have generated a set of equations denoting the influential physical features on various textural images, which have been summarized as a check list for assisting bag designers to select proper fabrics on expressing a specific textural image...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{a method of}} texture segmentation, which is invariant with respect to orientation, scale and shift. The method is based on feature extraction by multi-channel Gabor filtering. The channels of the filter bank are organized in a polar-log scheme according to Fourier-Mellin approaches. The extracted features are classified with symmetric phase-only matched filtering. As these filters are optimal for the determination of peak location, orientation angle and scaling factor can be determined very precisely. Furthermore, the segmentation is insensitive with respect to noise. The thesis provides design criteria for filter banks. The segmentation algorithm automatically generates filter banks according to these criteria. The segmentation scheme consists of highly parallel and regular structures and is numerically efficient. A further speed-up is possible by employing sliding-window Fourier transform for Gabor filtering. The proposed segmentation scheme is suitable for the error detection in wood, cotton, textile or paper producing industries. It is suitable for texture-based object recognition and for aerial image analysis. The thesis shows segmentation results on <b>textile</b> <b>textures,</b> honing textures, Brodatz textures and artificial textures...|$|R

For instance, digital rendering subject, which is being taught in both Interior and Architecture fields, is witnessing almost annually updated software versions. A lot of students and educators argued {{that there will be no}} need for manual rendering techniques to be learned. Therefore, the Interior Design Visual Presentation 1 course (ID 133) has been chosen from the first level of the Interior Design (ID) undergraduate program, as it has been taught for six years continually. This time frame will facilitate sound observation and critical analysis of the use of appropriate teaching methodologies. Furthermore, the researcher believes in the high value of the manual rendering techniques. The course objectives are: to define the basic visual rendering principles, to recall theories and uses of various types of colours and hatches, to raise the learners’ awareness of the value of studying manual render techniques, and to prepare them to present their work professionally. The students are female Arab learners aged between 17 and 20. At the outset of the course, the majority of them demonstrated negative attitude, lacking both motivation and confidence in manual rendering skills. This paper is a reflective appraisal of deploying two student-centred teaching pedagogies which are: Project-based learning (PBL) and Outcome-based education (OBE) on ID 133 students. This research aims of developing some teaching strategies to enhance the quality of teaching in this given course over an academic semester. The outcome of this research emphasized the positive influence of applying such educational methods on improving the quality of students’ manual rendering skills in terms of: materials, <b>textiles,</b> <b>textures,</b> lighting, and shade and shadow.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{surface of}} textile {{materials}} is highly textured, commonly in non-uniform ways. Because of this <b>texture</b> effect, <b>textile</b> surface appears rougher and more porous than other printing substrates, which can cause excessive ink penetration during printing process. Next, washing process is very important factor because it influences ink characteristics on printed samples as well as structural changes of the textile substrate. The aim {{of this paper is}} to determine the influences of washing process and different mesh tread count used for printing on print quality. This will be obtained by using spectrophotometric analysis, and GLCM image processing method for print mottle estimation. The results of this research show that increasing number of washing processes leads to higher color differences reproduction color in comparison to printed materials before washing. It also shows that <b>textile</b> surface <b>texture</b> has a great influence on print mottle as well as that number of washing treatment series can generate variations of solid-tone print uniformity...|$|R

The main purpose of this practice-based research is to explore <b>textile</b> <b>textures</b> through inspirations that originate from rocks’ historical, geological and cultural connotations, together with my personal experiences gained from rocks. A further aim is to discuss the inherent connection between people, nature and culture by exploring the meaning of rocks in humans' lives {{through the medium of}} textile making. The written work provides a brief historical review of how rocks serve humans’ material life as well as their spiritual needs. More specifically, in the Chinese culture, stone appreciation activity and the use of rocks in gardens, demonstrate that stones fulfil both spiritual and aesthetic functions. The concept of 'Unity of Nature and Man' that is embedded in Chinese stone culture introduces further dimension to the relationship between stones, nature and people, which also offers a reflection on the process of artistic creation. The 'Unity of Nature and Man' conducts the project towards Chinese aesthetics and philosophy and has the potential to enrich theoretical research. The formative processes behind geology not only sets up a scientific context for the practical research, but also offer methods and inspiration for building each art work. The relevance of geological time and the symbolism of the rocks’ contribution to the structure and visual images of textile art is examined as well. The practical investigation starts from rubbing and mapping rocks that provides pictorial construction, the significance of the action of rubbing being to connect myself with nature. A wide range of textile works and paintings which demonstrate rubbings connected with rocks has been studied, and there are many artists such as Ian Howard, Lin Lecheng, and Shi Hui who have been referred to in this {{research project}}.

40|$|A Looming Possibility: Towards a Theory of the Textile is, at its heart, a {{critical}} {{examination of the}} politics and aesthetics of desire. It positions 'the textile' as a material formed at the intersections of desire and modern politics, and it focuses attention on those instances where and when the <b>textile's</b> 'textility' (or <b>texture)</b> trumps its 'textuality' (or readability). It does this {{in an effort to}} reconsider the forms of relations that desire and politics typically take in modern, Western culture, and to propose that we must be prepared to address the 'consistencies' of these relations [...] should we ever hope to meaningfully reform them. The ways that fabric conditions and binds our bodies and desires is explored through close readings of fabrics that expose, supplement, and abstract the ways pleasure and felt experience adhere to one another through the body. The mid-century futurist fashion designs of Rudi Gernreich lay bear how the fashion system instrumentalizes the body's 'desire to move,' while inscribing it within the time-signatures of modern capitalism; the subversive and fetishistic figurations of modern military uniforms, produced in the wake of Liliana Cavani's 1974 film The Night Porter, reveal how the desire for flexibility is tempered by the physical comforts provided by discipline (and how the material conditions of the erotics of power and violence are made manifest); the War on Terror's (un-) uniformed 'unlawful enemy combatant' is cast alongside the fabrics used in the capture and detention of high value targets [...] high-tech 'digi-camouflages' and crude hoods fashioned from sand bags, laundry sacks, or disused towels.

H 577 P ITC 2016 Tsangxxv, 269 pages :color illustrationsAccurate color {{measurement}} plays a paramount role {{in establishing}} a reliable color quality control system in textile and garment industry. It is well-known that textile samples are rarely flat and always composed {{of a variety of}} surface textures, {{regarded as one of the}} most important parameters which influence the color appearance of the <b>textile</b> fabric. Such <b>texture</b> effect has significant impact on color quality control. Color measurement for <b>texture</b> <b>textile</b> fabrics today is widely achieved using instruments such as spectrophotometers, which average the reflection from a texture sample and may not be corrected to the visual perception. As spectrophotometer does not have spatial resolution, it fails to measure textiles and apparel with different surface structures. To date, there is not any systematical exploration of the surface texture and its influence on color appearance of the texture sample that leads to satisfactory prediction of the color difference. Recently, multispectral imaging system equipped with more than three channels is applied to estimate the spectral and spatial properties of a color fabric sample. It can accurately measure the colorimetric values, i. e., CIELAB of the fabric sample and compute the color difference for color matching applications. In this thesis, the fabric texture effects on visual and imaging color difference evaluation is investigated. The overall objective of this work is to correlate the color difference based on imaging color measurement to the visual color difference of physical texture samples. The work consists of three main parts summarized as follows. First of all, the parametric effect of fabric surface texture on color difference evaluation has been investigated via spectrophotometer and multispectral imaging system (ICM). The results show that blue texture fabrics cause the highest color difference while grey and yellow texture fabrics cause the lowest color difference. Furthermore, the total color difference for each texture pair comes from three individual color components, including lightness, chroma and hue differences in the CIELAB color space. In addition, histogram analysis was used to quantify the texture images, indicating that imaging color difference increased when the texture increased in complexity. The results from different measurement methods are greatly dependent upon the structures of the samples. Multispectral imaging system shows a higher parametric effect of texture than that of the spectrophotometer with diffuse illumination. In the second part, three types of color instruments such as spectroradiometer, digital camera and multispectral imaging system (ICM) were used for the instrumental and imaging color difference evaluation of woven texture samples. The color and textural on color measurement under normal and critical viewing conditions were studied by a series of psychophysical experiments using custom gray scale method. The finding also indicated that 68 % of the texture pairs resulted in smaller color differences when assessed at critical viewing distance of 3. 6 m as compared with those viewed at 0. 5 m. The relationship among visual, instrumental and imaging color difference results are examined. Lastly, visual experiments were conducted to investigate the texture effect on the visual color difference evaluation at the six color centers. The imaging color differences were calculated using three models, namely, average, pixel-wise and spatial-filtering, in comparison with various color difference formulae, i. e. CIELAB, CMC, CIE 94, CEIDE 2000 and image difference formula IPT. The results point out that CIEDE 2000 (1 : 1 : 1) color difference formula performs the best among all these formulae. The spatial-filtering model was optimized by means of optimizing parametric factors (kL, kC, kH) in the CIEDE 2000 formula, Gaussian and smoothing functions, respectively. Texture features extracted from the half-width of histogram and grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) were derived and used to quantitatively describe the parametric effect on the visual color difference evaluation. The combination of several texture features from GLCM was found to be significant, which led to the S-TCDM model to measure the visual color difference of two texture colors with accuracy of 11. 3 PF/ 3 units, much better than the mean PF/ 3 values of 16. 1 and 23. 3 obtained from human observer repeatability and observer accuracy, respectively.

40|$|This {{research}} develops three efficient textile {{flaw detection}} methods to facilitate automated textile inspection for the textile-related industries. Their novelty lies in detecting flaws with knowledge directly extracted from textile images, unlike existing methods which detect flaws with empirically specified texture features. The first two methods treat textile flaw detection as a texture classification problem, and consider that defect-free {{images of a}} textile fabric normally possess common latent images, called basis-images. The inner product of a basis-image and an image acquired from this fabric is a feature value of this fabric image. As the defect-free images are similar, their feature values gather in a cluster, whose boundary can be determined by using the feature values of known defect-free images. A fabric image is considered defect-free, if its feature values lie within this boundary. These methods extract the basis-images from known defect-free images in a training process, and require less consideration than existing methods {{on the degree of}} matching of a <b>textile</b> to the <b>texture</b> features specified for the textile. One method uses matrix singular value decomposition (SVD) to extract these basis-images containing the spatial relationship of pixels in rows or in columns. The alternative method uses tensor decomposition to find the relationship of pixels in both rows and columns within each training image and the common relationship of these training images. Tensor decomposition is found to be superior to matrix SVD in finding the basis-images needed to represent these defect-free images, because extracting and decomposing the tri-lateral relationship usually generates better basis-images. The third method solves the textile flaw detection problem by means of texture segmentation, and is suitable for online detection because it does not require texture features specified by experience or found from known defect-free images. The method detects the presence of flaws by using the contrast between regions in the feature images of a textile image. These feature images are the output of a filter bank consisting of Gabor filters with scales and rotations. This method selects the feature image with maximal image contrast, and partitions this image into regions with morphological watershed transform to facilitate faster searching of defect-free regions and to remove isolated pixels with exceptional feature values. Regions with no flaws have similar statistics, e. g. similar means. Regions with significantly dissimilar statistics may contain flaws and are removed iteratively from the set which initially contains all regions. Removing regions uses the thresholds determined by using Neyman-Pearson criterion and updated along with the remaining regions in the set. This procedure continues until the set only contains defect-free regions. The occurrence of the removed regions indicates the presence of flaws whose extents are decided by pixel classification using the thresholds derived from the defect-free regions. A prototype textile inspection system is built to demonstrate the automatic textile inspection process. The developed methods are proved reliable and effective by testing them with a variety of defective textile images. These methods also have several advantages, e. g. less empirical knowledge of textiles is needed for selecting texture features. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
