5|$|Prabhu further {{asserts that}} Tipu's hatred of Christians was {{compounded}} by fears that as they shared the same faith as their European co-religionists, the Christians were viewed as a potential fifth column {{in the event of}} a British attack. To this, he adds that Tipu also had future territorial ambitions in Goa and wanted to rid himself of any potential dissent from the Christians within his domain. Therefore, according to Prabhu, through coerced confessions of prominent Mangalorean Catholics, Tipu fabricated evidence of a large-scale Christian conspiracy against him, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it wasn't true.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} Sean Friedrich {{and tells him}} about the girl-on-girl event and that Dick and Beaver took her over to a bed and argued about who should have sex with her. Veronica talks to Dick, who {{presents}} a different account of events, saying that he didn't drug her and that he found Beaver with Veronica already. Veronica approaches Beaver, who gives a set of events more {{similar to that of}} Sean. However, after Dick and Sean leave, he purports to have run away and vomited before he could bring himself to rape her. Keith says that he has to leave for an engagement in Vegas. Logan talks to Aaron, but Aaron does not even know Logan's birth date. Veronica talks to Carrie Bishop (Leighton Meester), who says that she saw Veronica having sex with Duncan. Veronica confronts Duncan, who denies the rape accusations and remembers comforting Veronica in her drugged state. Duncan says that the sex was consensual even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that they were siblings, confirming Veronica's fears. Veronica talks to Wallace about the events but says that she is content with the answers she has. Keith calls a prostitute in Vegas for an unknown reason, while Veronica apologizes to Logan and tells her about the situation with Duncan. Back in Vegas, Keith talks to the prostitute, Cheyenne, about Abel Koontz, as Cheyenne and Koontz were together at the time of Lilly's murder. Veronica and Logan go into his darkened house before they realize that Aaron throws a surprise party for him, meaning that virtually the entire high school knows that they are dating.|$|E
25|$|Archduke Charles {{disagreed}} with Mack's aggressive strategy. When Emperor Francis I asked his opinion, Charles wrote him that Mack {{was making a}} serious blunder by invading Bavaria. Nevertheless, the emperor allowed Mack to pursue his course of action. Fearing the worst in Bavaria, Charles took up a defensive posture, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> he outnumbered Masséna.|$|E

50|$|In the song, Geiger sings {{about that}} he always wants what he cannot have, but he always gives it a try, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> might not get what he wants or {{the way he wants}} it to be.|$|R
25|$|Because of {{the steady}} {{increase}} {{of support for}} the social democrats Bismarck tried to suppress the party and related associations more firmly. Two assassination attempts on Kaiser Wilhelm I in May and June 1878 gave him the opportunity to act. Even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> the contrary was true, he accused the SAP of commissioning the assassins.|$|E
25|$|The {{excitement}} and {{interest of the}} dying game now centred around the batting performance of Alan Knott. His last day survival {{was more than just}} occupation of the crease. Beginning the day without a run to his name, he consistently thumbed his nose at the Australian attack for over three hours, playing shots even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that his ship was sinking under his very feet. It was a magnificent solo effort of defiance.|$|E
25|$|In August 1812 Laura was escorting convoys but on 8 September she {{encountered}} the French privateer brig Diligent, under Alexis Grassin, off the Delaware River. Laura had just captured three American prizes {{and was in}} the process of taking a fourth when Diligent arrived on the scene. Hunter recalled his boat and her men from the prize and sailed to engage, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> from his third prize that Diligent out-manned and outgunned Laura.|$|E

25|$|After {{completing}} his education, he followed in his father’s footsteps {{to begin a}} career in banking, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> his true calling was music. So he started singing in live music shows. At one such show, music mughal Gulshan Kumar spotted his talent and signed him on to cut a disc. Though he quit his job, he kept the pretense of working until his album was released. Then he broke the news and sought his parents’ blessings. Thus began his journey.|$|E
25|$|<b>Though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> {{repealing}} the laws {{would mean the}} end of his ministry, Peel decided to do so. It is possible that Peel merely used the Irish Famine as an excuse to repeal the Corn Laws as he had been an intellectual convert to free trade since the 1820s. Blake points out that if Peel were convinced that total repeal was necessary to stave off the famine, he would have enacted a bill that brought about immediate temporary repeal, not permanent repeal over a three-year period of gradual tapering-off of duties.|$|E
25|$|Jones was {{surprised}} when a Methodist superintendent helped him get a start in the church even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> Jones to be a communist and Jones did not meet him through the Communist Party USA. In 1952, he became a student pastor in Sommerset Southside Methodist Church, but claimed he left that church because its leaders barred him from integrating blacks into his congregation. Around this time, Jones witnessed a faith-healing service at a Seventh Day Baptist Church. He observed that it attracted people and their money and concluded that, with financial resources from such healings, he could help accomplish his social goals.|$|E

25|$|From 1911 until 1915, Curtin was {{employed}} as Secretary of the Timberworkers' Union, and during World War I {{he was a}} militant anti-conscriptionist; he was briefly imprisoned for refusing to attend a compulsory medical examination, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> he would fail the exam due to his very poor eyesight. He also at this time stood as the Labor candidate for Balaclava in 1914. The strain of this period led him to drink heavily and regularly, a vice which blighted his career for many years. In 1917, he married Elsie Needham, the sister of Labor Senator Ted Needham.|$|E
25|$|Persia {{was a vast}} empire with {{a history}} that was already ancient {{before the arrival of}} Islam. Al-Mas‘udi was aware of the {{influence}} of ancient Babylon on Persia. He had access to a wealth of translations by scholars such as ibn al-Muqaffa from Middle Persian into Arabic. In his travels he also personally consulted Persian scholars and Zoroastrian priests. He thus had access to much material, factual and mythical. Like all other Arabic historians he was unclear on the Achaemenid dynasty, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> of Kurush (Cyrus the Great). He was much clearer on the more recent dynasties and his estimation of the time between Alexander the Great and Ardashir is much more accurately depicted than it is in al-Tabari.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{high on a}} crag jutting {{over the}} river just above the cataract, she saw him! Her lost lover had not forgotten. Even above {{the roar of the}} water she heard him call her name. She stood in the canoe, waved her arms and screamed for help. <b>Though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> his chances of saving his beloved were slim at best, the young Englishman did not {{hesitate}} for a moment. He leaped from the overhanging bluff and plunged into the whitened water, just as Lillinonah's canoe struck a rock {{in the middle of the}} river and capsized, spilling her into the frothy current. Swiftly as he could, he swam to her side and clasped her body to him. Alas, neither realized that it was already too late. Still wrapped in loving embrace, the doomed pair disappeared into the boiling falls and were crushed to death as they were hurled to the rocks in the broad pool below.|$|E
50|$|The drama heightens because Roger does {{love his}} wife, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> is being pushed around. Bobbi sees Kim {{as a threat}} to her marriage, and Kim forms a bond with Susan. By the {{resolution}} of the play, Bobbi is alone.|$|R

50|$|Karz {{does have}} one problem though; he lacks {{a couple of}} top lieutenants to command two {{sections}} of his growing army. His choice falls on Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> they are not for hire.|$|R
25|$|Although Eugene {{was not of}} Austrian extraction, he {{did have}} Habsburg antecedents. His grandfather, Thomas Francis, founder of the Carignano line of the House of Savoy, {{was the son of}} Catherine Michelle—a {{daughter}} of Philip II of Spain—and the great-grandson of the Emperor Charles V. But of more immediate consequence to Leopold I was the fact that Eugene was the second cousin of Victor Amadeus, the Duke of Savoy, a connection that the Emperor hoped might prove useful in any future confrontation with France. These ties, together with his ascetic manner and appearance (a positive advantage to him at the sombre court of Leopold I), ensured the refugee from the hated French king a warm welcome at Passau, and a position in Imperial service. Though French was his favored language, he communicated with Leopold in Italian, as the Emperor (<b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it perfectly) disliked French. But Eugene also had a reasonable command of German, which he understood very easily, something that helped him much in the military.|$|E
25|$|Ruault {{was soon}} {{reinforced}} to 25,000 men, a force considerably outnumbering the besiegers. By 3 October the Austrian bombardment began to noticeably taper off. On 3 October, the citizen captain Charlemagne Ovigneur continued {{to serve his}} gun even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> his house was burning and his wife {{was going to give}} birth. On 4 October, Saxe-Teschen's wife, Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen appeared in the Austrian camp and the bombardment was redoubled. By this time, Saxe-Teschen became aware of Brunswick's retreat as well as the increasing numbers of French troops opposing him. On 6 October the Austrian commander directed that the heavy siege guns be removed from the batteries. By this time 60,000 shot and shell had been fired into Lille. The Austrians evacuated the trenches on 8 October and withdrew almost unmolested {{in the face of a}} weak pursuit led by Félix Marie Pierre Chesnon de Champmorin. The inhabitants of Lille emerged from their town and, in their rage at the destruction, leveled the Austrian siege works. The victory was celebrated throughout France and caused many men to enlist in the armies.|$|E
500|$|Wooden Leg {{describes}} {{the recovery of}} many objects from the dead soldiers, some of which the Indians did not understand, such as a compass and a pocketwatch. [...] He threw away paper money he found, not realising its value. He gave away coins even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> their value, {{because he had no}} wish to trade with white men. [...] When a new column of soldiers was observed approaching (the main force of infantry under Brigadier General Alfred Terry), the council of Chiefs decided not to continue the fight. [...] At this point the Indians disengaged and the entire camp packed up and relocated.|$|E

500|$|In August 2014, it was {{confirmed}} that producers had planned a romance storyline for Mark and his housemate Paige Smith (Olympia Valance). After growing closer, they realised {{that they had}} a deeper connection than friendship. They later agreed to go out for dinner, but neither of them called it a date. Mark struggled with the idea of moving on from Kate, and even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it was a date, he had not admitted it out loud. Mark ignored Paige afterwards, causing her to confront him as a storm hit Erinsborough. Brennan and Paige then consummated their relationship. Their first official date ended abruptly when Paige turned up wearing an old dress of Kate's she found in a charity shop. Brennan reacted angrily and shouted at Paige to leave the bar. He later realised that he had been too harsh, but just as he decided to give their relationship another go, he saw her kissing another man. McGregor commented [...] "He thinks he's blown his chances with her – but he's also wondering if this is what he really wants." ...|$|E
500|$|Other than {{mentioning}} that {{he carried a}} pocket chronometer by French which gave good results, Stokes' account of the voyage does not list or even enumerate the chronometers. [...] It may be that chronometers were now so commonplace that their use was no longer something of note. [...] However it is quite clear that the chronometers remained {{a key part of}} the mission; frequent stops were made throughout the voyage to check the rates. On 7 December 1839 Stokes went ashore at Point Pearce near the mouth of Victoria River to make observations. Even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> the indigenous Australians could be dangerous, he left behind his gun to more safely carry a chronometer. [...] While separated, Stokes was pursued by a group of Australians, one of whom pierced Stokes' chest cavity with a spear throw. Despite his wounds and profuse bleeding, Stokes considered the chronometer to be valuable enough to save; he carried it while he staggered back to his comrades barely able to walk and still being pursued by his attackers.|$|E
500|$|The next day, Eichelberger's {{party was}} flown to Dobodura, where he assumed command of US {{troops in the}} Buna area. He {{relieved}} Harding, and replaced him with the division's artillery commander, Brigadier General Albert W. Waldron. He relieved other officers too, appointing a 26-year-old captain to command a battalion. Some of the 32nd Infantry Division's officers privately denounced Eichelberger as ruthless and [...] "Prussian". He set an example by moving among the troops on the front lines, sharing their hardships and danger. Despite the risk, he purposefully wore his three silver stars while at the front, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> Japanese snipers targeted officers, because he wanted his troops to know their commander was present. After the snipers seriously wounded Waldron in the shoulder, Eichelberger appointed Byers to command the 32nd Infantry Division, but he too was wounded on 16 December. This left Eichelberger as the only American general in the forward area, and he assumed personal command of the division. He was not the most senior general present though; he served {{under the command of}} Australian, Lieutenant General Edmund Herring, whom he referred to in letters to Em as [...] "my grand colleague".|$|E
5000|$|The {{track is}} about a male narrator who is telling his former female lover that [...] "If you ever feel like lovin' me again" [...] he will allow her back into his life even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> the {{relationship}} is over.|$|R
25|$|Another {{parallel}} is {{the tale}} of Sir Balin in the Arthurian Legend. <b>Though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> wields an accursed sword, Balin nevertheless continues his quest to regain King Arthur's favour, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> unintentionally causes misery wherever he goes. Fate eventually catches up {{with him when he}} unwittingly kills his own brother, who in turn mortally wounds him.|$|R
50|$|Morales is a sardonic pragmatist {{who thinks}} moral rectitude is lovely but {{ineffective}} in a street fight. <b>Though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> how to manipulate both his public image and behind-the-scenes politics, he's still a killer {{in the courtroom}} who lives to see justice served.|$|R
