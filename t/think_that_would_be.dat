500|$|... "SMS (Bangerz)" [...] is {{the third}} track on Miley Cyrus's fourth studio album Bangerz, which was {{released}} in October 2013. Although the song never entered the Billboard Hot 100, the album's strong digital downloads helped it reach number 10 on Billboards Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart, as well as number 157 on the UK Singles Chart. The song is marked as explicit by the RIAA due to its explicit language. Although in October 2013 Cyrus claimed she wanted the song to be the third single off Bangerz, [...] "Adore You" [...] was the album's third single release instead. Talking about plans for a music video, Cyrus hoped [...] "that the video will be as epic as the 'Work Bitch' one, so I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the smartest choice." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{director}} Sam Mendes {{had been}} working on a film version of the story for several years, and in June 2003 Sondheim was approached to write the script. Although he turned down the offer, Mendes and producer Walter F. Parkes obtained his approval to use writer John Logan instead. Logan had previously collaborated with Parkes on Gladiator, and claimed his biggest challenge in adapting the Sondheim stage play [...] "was taking a sprawling, magnificent Broadway musical and making it cinematic, and an emotionally honest film. Onstage, you can have a chorus sing as the people of London, but I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> alienating in a movie." [...] Mendes left to direct the 2005 film Jarhead, and Burton leaped at taking over the direction after his project, Ripley's Believe It or Not!, fell apart due to its excessive budget.|$|E
500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2009, Sacramone briefly stayed in Los Angeles and {{designed}} for Tank Farm, a men's fashion company. She has discussed her intent to return to college in the media, but announced in August 2009 {{that she was not}} intending to return to Brown University. [...] "I plan to continue school, [...] I’m looking into transferring somewhere in Boston,” {{she said in an interview}} with Inside Gymnastics magazine. “Brown is a great school and I loved it, but it was just not the best atmosphere for me; maybe a little too liberal. It was a great two years, and I learned a lot about myself and from the professors and coaches there. I’m looking at Boston University, Boston College and Harvard. I want to weigh my options before I make an ultimate decision, but I would love to transfer to Harvard. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> pretty much ideal." ...|$|E

50|$|Part three {{extends the}} effects of sexual {{selection}} into language, art, hunting and agriculture, through the idea of honest signaling - sexual signals that also cost the signer.

I think that's a good way to deal with it, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a good model for other states to have. Some places call them domestic partnerships, some states call it civil unions, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{the best way to deal}} with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a January 2014 interview, Fisher {{confirmed}} {{her involvement}} and {{the involvement of}} the original cast in the upcoming sequels by saying [...] "as for the next Star Wars film, myself, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill are expected to report to work in March or April. I'd like to wear my old cinnamon buns hairstyle again but with white hair. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> funny." ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{kinds of}} women's groups {{all over the}} country will be using this week on August 26 particularly, to point out those areas in women's life which are still not addressed. For example, a {{question}} of equality before the law; we are interested in the equal rights amendment. The question of child care centers which are totally inadequate in the society, and which women require, {{if they are going to}} assume their rightful position in terms of helping in decisions of the society. The question of a women's right to control her own reproductive processes, that is, laws prohibiting abortion in the state or putting them into criminal statutes; I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a statute that we would [...] addressing ourselves to.|$|E

50|$|With that, {{the story}} plunges back into other guest vignettes, while {{continuing}} to follow Jenny and the other hotel staff. The novel does not end with the operatic death and funeral of another guest, because the writer <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> too maudlin. A formerly famous opera singer was overcome with emotion and died when a famed tenor came to serenade her. All the staff and guests at the hotel break into operatic song at her funeral.|$|R

2500|$|On 24 January 2009, Berlusconi {{announced}} his aim {{to increase the}} numbers of military patrolling the Italian cities from 3,000 to 30,000 in order {{to crack down on}} what he called an [...] "evil army" [...] of criminals. Responding to a female journalist who asked him if this tenfold increase in patrolling soldiers would be enough to secure Italian women from being raped, he said: [...] "We could not field a big enough force to avoid this risk [...] We would need as many soldiers as beautiful women and I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> possible, because our women are so beautiful." [...] Opposition leaders called the remarks insensitive and in bad taste. Berlusconi retorted that he had merely wanted to compliment Italian women. Other critics accused him of creating a [...] "police state".|$|E
2500|$|According to Ratcliff, Sue getting {{pregnant}} {{put her in}} a dilemma because she worried that happiness for the Osmans would need to be curtailed if she decided to leave the programme; she felt this would be unfair on viewers because of all the misery Sue had been put through on-screen already. Discussing this in 1987, Ratcliff said, [...] "I knew nothing about the baby plans until a few weeks ago when I came back from my holidays and was told that Sue was pregnant again. Sue has gone through enough {{in the last couple of}} years. I'm glad she's got her dearest wish [...] I think she'll make a great mum and I'm sure Ali will be supportive. Hopefully, the storylines will open up for me, but it also means that if the pregnancy goes well and the baby is fine, it would be very difficult for me to leave without there being another tragedy in the Osman family. I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fair on the show or the viewers." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of the lead single, [...] "Russian Roulette", Harmony was aware of the mixed {{reaction}} from fans who had heard the track. He assured fans that the song was not fully representative {{to the rest of the}} album, though it reflected Rihanna's growth as an artist. In an interview with Rap-Up, Tricky Stewart announced that he had collaborated with The-Dream on the project. He described the album as a whole as [...] "uptempo and edgy", stating that the album is different from her past works. In February 2010, Rihanna expressed a positive opinion on the album, but commented that her future work would be less intense. She asserted, [...] "I really like the bottom, the grime of it. But if I were to combine that with more energetic, up-tempo pop records, then I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a happy marriage. And that's where we'll probably go next". When asked what the most important song to her was, she stated that she doesn't have one, however, [...] "Fire Bomb" [...] and [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] were cited as her favorites.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} by the Sunday Times on 23 July 1989, Allan recalled a significant episode when Terre'Blanche had drunkenly hammered on her flat door and eventually slept on the doorstep {{and that she had}} to step over him the next morning. Despite her objections, her editor, Myburgh, insisted on publishing answering machine messages allegedly by Terre'Blanche, accompanied by a denial by Allan of counter claims that he had made against her. Allan recounted conversations with her editor [...] "After the bomb he said, 'Right, we'll publish the tapes.' I said I didn't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> wise, as the security police had told me my life would be in danger. He said, 'We're going to blow them out of the water.'" [...] She had just emerged from a course of traction for her seized back, and was then rushed to hospital with a bleeding ulcer because of the stress. Allan fled to Britain permanently for security reasons in the same week that the transcripts were published. The tapes were the Sunday Times lead story published on 30 July 1989 with the front-page headline 'JANI: MY ET TAPES'.|$|E
2500|$|At the November 2010 FOMC meeting, Warsh was {{extremely}} {{skeptical of the}} Fed's plan to generate economic activity and jobs by trying to lower long-term interest rates. Although unemployment was close to 10%, Warsh told his colleagues that he would only vote for QE2 {{out of respect for}} Chairman Bernanke: [...] "If I were in your chair, I would not be leading the Committee in this direction, and frankly, if I were in the chair of most people around this room, I would dissent." [...] Even if unemployment were [...] "unacceptably high," [...] he suggested that he would vote against the program continuing if inflation inched up a bit: [...] "if inflation were to move up and were to be broadly consistent with the implicit inflation target [...] in different people's minds around this room, even if unemployment were unacceptably high, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> time to stop this program. If inflation expectations were {{to move out of the}} range that they have been in for a long time, that would be a reason to end this program, even if unemployment were exceptionally high and GDP were well below what we think the economy is ultimately capable of." [...] The Federal Reserve has a legal dual mandate to pursue maximum employment as well as to ensure price stability.|$|E
2500|$|There was {{considerable}} negative {{reaction to the}} characters Mudflap and Skids, who some perceived as embodying racist stereotypes. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that [...] "the characters [...] indicate that minstrelsy remains as much in fashion in Hollywood as when, well, Jar Jar Binks was set loose by George Lucas". Critic Scott Mendelson said [...] "To say that these two are the most astonishingly racist caricatures that I've ever seen in a mainstream motion picture would be an understatement." [...] Harry Knowles, founder of Ain't It Cool News, went further, asking his readers [...] "not to support this film" [...] because [...] "you'll be taking [...] to see a film with the lowest forms of humor, stereotypes, and racism around." [...] Bay (the director) has attempted to defend the film as [...] "good clean fun" [...] and insisted that [...] "We're just putting more personality in." [...] Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman responded to the controversy with [...] "It's really {{hard for us to}} sit here and try to justify it. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very foolish, and if someone wants to be offended by it, it's their right. We were very surprised when we saw it, too, and it's a choice that was made. If anything, it just shows you that we don't control every aspect of the movie." ...|$|E
