40|$|An {{analytical}} {{investigation was}} made of a <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> aircraft engine system which uses a cryogenic fuel. This system consists of a main turboshaft engine which is mechanically coupled (by cross-shafting) to a topping loop which augments the shaft power output of the system. The thermodynamic performance of the <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> engine was analyzed and {{compared with that of}} a reference (conventional-type) turboshaft engine. For the cycle operating conditions selected, the performance of the <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> engine in terms of brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) was determined to be about 12 percent better than that of the reference turboshaft engine. Engine weights were estimated for both the <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> engine and the reference turboshaft engine. These estimates were based on a common shaft power output for each engine. Results indicate that the weight of the <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> engine is comparable to that of the reference turboshaft engine. Previously announced in STAR as N 83 - 3494...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} recent {{results of}} {{the second phase of}} system analyses on the thermionic <b>topping</b> <b>cycle.</b> A comparison is made among various thermionic heat-exchanger (THX) geometries. Two methods of transferring electric power are considered. In the first, power is provided at relatively high voltages by coupling it out inductively via transformers built into the THX modules. In the second method, converter cells are series-connected within a THX module and external power conditioning is used. The results show that the use of a thermionic <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> can result in significant improvements in overall system efficiency...|$|R
50|$|Unlike <b>After</b> <b>Burner</b> II, {{there is}} no {{throttle}} to control speed, nor an ability to barrel roll. After certain stages, players may {{have a choice of}} two different stages, an element later revisited in <b>After</b> <b>Burner</b> Climax. Also unlike <b>After</b> <b>Burner,</b> Sky Target has large, sci-fi-inspired bosses that need to be destroyed in a set amount of time in order to receive a score bonus.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a Rankine cycle is primarily {{determined by the}} temperatures of heat addition and rejection. However, no working fluid has been identified which will operate in a Rankine cycle over an extremely wide temperature range. Multiple Rankine <b>topping</b> <b>cycles</b> offer a technique for achieving high thermal efficiencies in power plants by allowing the use of several working fluids. This paper gives a history of Rankine <b>topping</b> <b>cycles,</b> presents an analysis for the calculation of the overall {{efficiency of}} a three-module multiple Rankine cycle, and presents results from a case study for a sodium-mercury-water cycle...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{model is}} used to {{calculate}} the thermal efficiency and specific power of simple jet engines and jet engines with a wave-rotor <b>topping</b> <b>cycle.</b> The performance of the wave rotor is based on measurements from a previous experiment. Applied to the case of an aircraft flying at Mach 0. 8, the calculations show that an engine with a wave rotor <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> may have gains in thermal efficiency of approximately 1 to 2 percent and gains in specific power of approximately 10 to 16 percent over a simple jet engine with the same overall compression ratio. Even greater gains are possible if the wave rotor's performance can be improved...|$|R
50|$|<b>After</b> <b>Burner</b> was {{followed}} by <b>After</b> <b>Burner</b> II, which was released on the same year. Some consider this game {{to be more of}} a revision of its predecessor, rather than an entirely new game, a practice later repeated by Sega for Galaxy Force and Galaxy Force 2.|$|R
50|$|Reviewing the 32X version, GamePro {{commented that}} the graphics, sound, and {{gameplay}} are all great, but that {{the only difference between}} it and the Genesis version of <b>After</b> <b>Burner</b> II are some minor graphical and audio enhancements, making it only worthwhile to gamers who have never played an <b>After</b> <b>Burner</b> game before.|$|R
5000|$|<b>After</b> <b>Burner</b> II is an arcade-style flight game {{released}} by Sega in 1987. [...] It {{is the second}} game in the <b>After</b> <b>Burner</b> series. In the game, players fly a F-14 Tomcat jet fighter, gunning down enemies while avoiding incoming fire. Like OutRun, another Sega arcade game, <b>After</b> <b>Burner</b> II came in several versions, the most famous being a large, servo actuated, sit-down cabinet which resembled a cockpit and moved according to {{the motion of the}} plane onscreen. The cockpit would bank in the same direction the on-screen aircraft was banking. There was also a more basic upright cabinet version.|$|R

40|$|The {{most likely}} use of {{thermionic}} conversion {{is in the}} form of a <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> combined with a steam-turbogenerator plant. A specific reference system is chosen in which the thermionic <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> occurs in thermionic heat exchangers referred to as large, modular thermionic units to which heat is transferred from a separate heat source and which reject their heat to a conventional steam turboelectric system. Results of analysis show that the performance and cost criteria for practical thermionic topping of large electric power plants are well within the reach of demonstrated and foreseeable converter capabilities. Thermionic topping has many significant advantages over unconventional <b>cycles</b> proposed for <b>topping</b> applications, including level of demonstrated and projected performance and lifetime, development time, and design simplicity...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the thermodynamic performance of a novel small-scale power plant that employs a combined cycle for the energy generation from carbon-neutral biomass, such as pruning residues. The combined cycle is composed of an externally fired Joule Brayton cycle followed by a bottoming steam <b>cycle.</b> The <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> has the unique particularity of being composed of a cost-effective turbocharger taken from the automotive industry, in place of a more expensive commercial micro-turbine. The turbocharger can be either directly connected to the electric generator (after a few modifications) or coupled (without modifications) with a power turbine moving the generator. The use of solid biomass in the proposed plant is allowed by the presence of an external combustor and a gas-to-gas heat exchanger. The warm flue gases exhausted by the <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> are used in a bottoming cycle to produce steam, which can power a steam expander. This paper thermodynamically assesses the novel combined cycle in the configuration for the <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> that employs a turbocharger coupled with a power turbine capable of generating 30 kW of electrical power. Furthermore, the comparison between the performance obtained using the bottoming water Rankine cycle and a bottoming Organic Rankine Cycle is provided...|$|R

40|$|A {{design study}} {{was made of}} the {{potassium}} <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> powerplant for central station use. Initially, powerplant performance and economics were studied parametrically by using an existing steam plant as the bottom part of the cycle. Two distinct powerplants were identified which had good thermodynamic and economic performance. Conceptual designs were made of these two powerplants in the 1200 MWe size, and capital and operating costs were estimated for these powerplants. A technical evaluation of these plants was made including conservation of fuel resources, environmental impact, technology status, and degree of development risk. It is concluded that the potassium <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> could {{have a significant impact on}} national goals such as air and water pollution control and conservation of natural resources because of its higher energy conversion efficiency...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of coal-fired magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) {{power can be}} viewed as consisting of two parts; the <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> and the bottoming <b>cycle.</b> The <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> consists of the coal combustor, MHD generator and associated components. The bottoming cycle consists of the heat recovery, steam generation, seed recovery/regeneration, emissions control (gas and particulate), ash handling and deposition, and materials evaluation. The report concentrates on the bottoming cycle, for which much of the technology was developed at the University of Tennessee Space Institute (UTSI). Because of the complexity of the required technology, a number of issues required investigation. Of specific concern regarding the bottoming cycle, was the design of the steam cycle components and emissions control. First, the high combustion temperatures and the use of large quantities of potassium in the MHD combustor results in a difference in the composition of the gases entering the bottoming cycle compared to conventional systems. Secondly, a major goal of the UTSI effort was to use a variety of coals in the MHD system, especially the large reserves of high-sulfur coals available in the United States...|$|R
