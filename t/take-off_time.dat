This study examines air traffic flow: recorded landings and <b>take-off</b> <b>times,</b> arrival times and time between arrivals and times spent in the airport. The data collected were analyzed using the queue theory to know the airport turnaround time and the rate of usage of the airport as well as time variation in usage pattern.

40|$|Abstract—Using constraint-based local search, we {{effectively}} {{model and}} efficiently {{solve the problem}} of balancing the traffic demands on portions of the European airspace while ensuring that their capacity constraints are satisfied. The traffic demand of a portion of airspace is the hourly number of flights planned to enter it, and its capacity is the upper bound on this number under which air-traffic controllers can work. Currently, the only form of demand-capacity balancing we allow is ground holding, that is the changing of the <b>take-off</b> <b>times</b> of not yet airborne flights. Experiments with projected European flight plans of the year 2030 show that already this first form of demand-capacity balancing is feasible without incurring too much total delay and that it can lead to a significantly better demand-capacity balance.

40|$|Some {{in-service}} {{deterioration in}} any mechanical device, {{such as an}} aircraft's gas-turbine engine, is inevitable. However, its extent and rate depend upon the qualities of design and manufacturing, {{as well as on}} the maintenance/repair practices followed by the users.

40|$|In the SESAR {{traffic growth}} predictions, traffic {{complexity}} {{will become an}} issue that the current Air Traffic Management organization {{is not able to}} handle. The 4 D trajectory concept offers new perspectives for deconflicting the traffic by groundholding aircraft before they take-off. This paper studies the possible complexity reduction achievable by optimizing the aircraft <b>take-off</b> <b>times.</b> Therefore a simple model is introduced to detect pairwise 3 D possible conflicts and define conflicting takeoff time differences. Two resolution algorithms are tested on a real traffic data sample collected in the French airspace. The first one is based on a Constraint Programming model of the problem and ensures the optimality of the maximum delay required to solve every conflict. The second one uses an evolutionary computation algorithm to minimize the mean delay among the aircraft population. A sliding window model is introduced {{to reduce the size of}} the problem and to regularly update the current situation. Experimental results performed in the French airspace with fast time simulation show that with perfect 4 D trajectory, every conflict over flight level 290 can be solved by delaying less than a quarter of the traffic within a range of delays varying from 1 to 90 minutes and a mean delay of 4 minutes. The Constraint Programming approach gives better results than the evolutionary computation approach. Adding uncertainty around 4 D trajectories dramatically degrades the results...|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{airports}} are under increasing pressure {{to comply with}} the Eurocontrol collaborative decision making (CDM) initiative, to ensure that information is passed between stakeholders, integrate automated decision support or make predictions. These systems can also aid effective operations beyond the airport by communicating scheduling decisions to other relevant parties, such as Eurocontrol, for passing on to downstream airports and enabling overall airspace improvements. One of the major CDM components is aimed at producing the target <b>take-off</b> <b>times</b> and target startup-approval times, i. e. scheduling when the aircraft should push back from the gates and start their engines and when they will take off. For medium-sized airports, a common choice for this is a “pre-departure sequencer” (PDS). In this paper, we describe the design and requirements challenges which arose during our development of a PDS system for medium sized international airports. Firstly, the scheduling problem is highly dynamic and event driven. Secondly, it is important to end-users that the system be predictable and, as far as possible, transparent in its operation, with decisions that can be explained. Thirdly, users can override decisions, and this information has to be taken into account. Finally, {{it is important that the}} system is as fair as possible for all users of the airport, and the interpretation of this is considered here.

40|$|Some {{in-service}} {{deterioration in}} any mechanical device, {{such as an}} aircraft's gas-turbine engine, is inevitable. However, its extent and rate depend upon the qualities of design and manufacture, {{as well as on}} the maintenance/repair practices followed by the users. As a result of experiencing deterioration (of the engine as a whole or any of its components individually), an engine will seek a different steady operating point relative to that for an engine with no deterioration. This results in changes in the available thrust from the engine(s) at the same TETs and/or rotational-speeds. Any reduction in the available thrust at specified engine settings, especially maximum available thrust from the engines, will have a significant adverse effect upon the aircraft's operational-performance. These adverse effects can be reduced by having a better knowledge of the effects of each such deterioration on the aircraft's operational-performance. Subsequently improvements can be made in the design and manufacture of adversely-affected components as well as in maintenance and repair practices. For a military aircraft's mission-profile (consisting of several flight-segments), using a bespoke computer simulation, the consequences of low-pressure compressors' fouling of a turbofan upon the aircraft's mission operational-effectiveness have been predicted. This will help in making wiser management decisions, such as whether to remove the aero-engines from the aircraft for maintenance or to continue using them with some changes in the aircraft's mission-profile, or planning different <b>take-off</b> <b>times</b> and/or carrying different fuel/weapon loads for aircraft with the various extents of low-pressure compressors' fouling.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a new concept}} aimed at better dealing with delays caused by {{regulations}} is presented. Inspired in future 4 D trajectories, where a time constraint can be applied at each way-point, it is proposed to spread the total delay imposed by a regulation over the trajectory that goes from the departing airport to the regulated airspace. Given a nominal cruise speed, there exist a set of possible lower speeds that allow a longer flight (and then, a cumulative flight delay) with the same or less fuel consumption if compared with the nominal situation. In this way, the aircraft that has been delayed can consider to <b>take-off</b> on <b>time</b> and loose this time by flying slower and requiring the same or less fuel than initially planed. Besides the positive environmental impact, the airliner can bet that finally the regulation at the congested airspace may be not applied and being the departure on time, the delay can be absorbed more easily in flight with a minimal or null fuel consumption increase. Finally, this concept is applied to some example flights...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} NASA's Integrated Demand Management (IDM) {{concept and}} {{presents the results}} from an early proof-of-concept evaluation and an exploratory experiment. An initial development of the concept was focused on integrating two systems - i. e. the FAA's newly deployed Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS) tool called the Collaborative Trajectory Options Program (CTOP) and the Time-Based Flow Management (TBFM) system with Extended Metering (XM) capabilities to manage projected heavy traffic demand into a capacity-constrained airport. A human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation experiment was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the initial development of the concept by adapting it to an arrival traffic problem at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) during clear weather conditions. In this study, the CTOP was utilized to strategically plan the arrival traffic demand by controlling <b>take-off</b> <b>times</b> of both short- and long-haul flights (long-hauls specify aircraft outside TBFM regions and short-hauls specify aircraft within TBFM regions) {{in a way that}} results in equitable delays among the groups. Such strategic planning allows less airborne delay to occur within TBFM by feeding manageable long-haul traffic demand while reserving sufficient slots in the overhead streams for the short-haul departures. The manageable traffic demand indicates the TBFM scheduler assigns no more airborne delay than its assigned airspace is capable of absorbing. TBFM then uses its time-based metering capabilities to deliver the desirable throughput by tactically rescheduling the TBFM entered long-haul flights and short-haul departures. Additional research was also performed to explore use of Required Time of Arrival (RTA) capabilities as a potential control mechanism for the airborne flights to improve arrival traffic delivery accuracy of scheduled long-haul traffic demand. The study results show that both short- and long-haul flights received similar ground delays. In addition, there was a noticeable reduction in the total amount of excessive unanticipated last-minute ground delays, i. e. delays that are frequently imposed on the short-haul flight in current day operations due to saturation in the overhead stream, commonly referred to as 'double penalty'. Furthermore, the concept achieved the target throughput while minimizing the expected cost associated with overall delays in arrival traffic. Assessment of the RTA capabilities showed that there was indeed improvement of the scheduled entry times into TBFM regions by using RTA capabilities. However, with respect to reduction in delays incurred within TBFM, there was no observable benefit of improving the precision of long-haul flights entry times...|$|R
