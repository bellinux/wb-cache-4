5|$|On 7 January 2010 a Brussels-London train {{broke down}} in the Channel Tunnel, {{resulting}} in three other trains failing to complete their journeys. The cause of the failure was the onboard signalling system. Due to the severe weather, a limited service was operated in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tensions mounted further, and in {{the evening}} of 21 or 22 June (sources vary), angry workers began {{building}} barricades and assaulting police and military patrols, killing {{those who did not}} surrender. About a hundred barricades were constructed over the course of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{first part}} of Vasey's plan {{involved}} the blocking of the Killerton Trail to prevent the Japanese from using it as an escape route, {{and to provide a}} jumping off point for a later advance by the 18th Infantry Brigade. The 2nd Battalion, 163rd Infantry, under Major Walter R. Rankin, set out early on 9 January 1943. Company G, covering the flank of the advance, was strongly engaged by Japanese heavy machine gun, mortar, and rifle fire. The remainder of the battalion established themselves astride the trail in a new position which was named Rankin after the battalion commander. The attack had cost four dead and six wounded. More casualties would be taken holding the position over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R
5000|$|During <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> years, <b>Days</b> Before Tomorrow {{underwent}} {{a number of}} personnel changes, with Kahn and Klein remaining from the original lineup.

60|$|New {{assurance}} {{of the truth}} came upon him in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> following <b>days,</b> when it was put forth how the wounded man had been married on his bed, and to whom, and how, though always in a dangerous condition, he was a shade better. Bradley would far rather have been seized for his murder, {{than he would have}} read that passage, knowing himself spared, and knowing why.|$|R
5|$|The remnant low drifted south {{towards the}} Gulf of Mexico before being absorbed by a cold front (which also picked {{remnants}} of Subtropical Depression Twenty-two), and moving northeast.

5|$|A rogue unit of insurgents {{headed by}} Algirdas Klimaitis and {{encouraged}} by Germans from the Sicherheitspolizei and Sicherheitsdienst, started anti-Jewish pogroms in Kaunas (Kovno) {{on the night}} of 25â€“26 June 1941. Over a thousand Jews perished over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> in what was the first pogrom in Nazi-occupied Lithuania. Different sources give different figures, one being 1,500 and another 3,800, with additional victims in other towns of the region.|$|E
5|$|An HD remaster {{edition of}} the series was {{confirmed}} in August 2011 although Mitsuo Fukuda stated it was leaked information and that the official information would come in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> In November 2011, Bandai announced {{the release of the}} series in four Blu-ray compilations between March and December 2012.

5|$|During 26 December, the Fiji Meteorological Service {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} depression that had developed within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, about 575km (355mi) to the south-east of Nauru. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> the depression gradually developed and organised further, {{as it moved}} towards the west-southwest {{under the influence of}} a north-easterly steering flow. During 28 December, the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Cyclone 05P, before the FMS named it Rewa as it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> the system gradually intensified under the influence of favourable upper-level winds while it moved towards the south-southwest, passing through the Solomon Islands on 29December and affecting the southeastern islands of Papua New Guinea. As it moved through the Solomon Islands, Rewa moved out of the South Pacific basin and into the Australian region, where the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) took the primary warning responsibility for the system.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Italian defeats in Greece and North Africa, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht ordered the deployment of some German forces to these theatres. Amongst the Luftwaffe contingent deployed was the command unit StG 3, which touched down in Sicily in December 1940.

5|$|Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> months, <b>Day</b> {{returned}} to moulding Sabrina {{to meet his}} requirements for the ideal woman, choosing what she would wear, and pushing his ideas of frugality upon her. Sabrina took on all the ideas willingly and Day believed he had finally created a woman who would meet all his requirements. He was so confident that he talked openly of marrying Sabrina, though she was unaware of his intentions. Eventually one of Day's friends {{let her know that}} he hoped to marry her. Sabrina confronted Day about the rumours and he admitted they were true, neglecting to mention that he had hoped to marry her since the day he met her.|$|R
50|$|In October 2015, the NT {{branch of}} the Labor Party disendorsed Lawrie, after concern her legal issues were harming Labor's {{election}} chances.

At this stage, the battalion was 450-strong. By 1 May, 30 officers and 940 other ranks from the battalion had landed.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} aging of Fe 0 -core/oxide-shell {{nanoparticles}} in water {{with a focus on}} changes in (i) the composition and structure of the particles (by XRD, TEM, XPS, and bulk Fe 0 content), and (ii) the reactivity of the particles (by carbon tetrachloride reaction kinetics, electrochemical corrosion potentials, and H 2 production rates). The results show that nano-Fe 0 becomes more reactive between 0 and ~ 2 days exposure to water, and then gradually loses reactivity over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>days.</b> <b>The</b> behavior of unaged nano-Fe 0 in our laboratory experiments may be similar to that in fi eld-scale applications for source-zone treatment due to the short reaction times involved.

The wave was soon absorbed by a trough of low pressure during <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{impactor}} returned {{images as}} late as three seconds before impact. Most of the data captured was stored on board the flyby spacecraft, which radioed approximately 4,500 images from the HRI, MRI, and ITS cameras to Earth over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> The energy from the collision was similar in size to exploding five tons of dynamite and the comet shone six times brighter than normal.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Dean {{originated}} from inside a frontal cloud band, which had moved off the Eastern Coast of the United States on September 22. During <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> the band became stationary from the Bahamas to beyond Bermuda. During this period, a 1035millibar (30.56inHg) high pressure cell had become settled over the northeastern United States.
