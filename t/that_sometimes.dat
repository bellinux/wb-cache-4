5|$|Conservapedia's {{article on}} {{evolution}} presents evolution as a naturalistic theory that lacks support and that conflicts with {{evidence in the}} fossil record that creationists perceive to support creationism. The entry also suggests <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> the Bible has been more scientifically correct than the scientific community. Schlafly has defended the statement as presenting an alternative to evolution.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{sometimes}} operate {{units that}} specialize in measurement of the Earth's magnetic field. These are geomagnetic observatories, typically {{part of a national}} Geological survey, for example the British Geological Survey's Eskdalemuir Observatory. Such observatories can measure and forecast magnetic conditions such as magnetic storms <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> affect communications, electric power, and other human activities.|$|E

5|$|Most rails are secretive wetland {{birds that}} have made little {{cultural}} impression, but as a formerly common farmland bird with a loud nocturnal call <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> led to disturbed sleep for rural dwellers, the corn crake has acquired a variety of folk names and some commemoration in literature.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{does not}} itself have many predators and large {{individuals}} are adept at jumping and swimming to escape attackers. Any attached juveniles benefit from this. However, the scallops are intolerant of low salinity levels, and mortality sometimes occurs {{as a result}} of a pool of relatively fresh water <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> forms during the summer months under the sea ice as it melts.|$|E

Feynman said that <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> bothered him, too, adding, when you get to be as old as he was, and have told so many stories to so many people, even when he was dead he would not be {{completely}} gone.|$|E
5|$|When {{the station}} was first opened in 1838 by the North Union Railway, the line north of the station passed through a tunnel under {{the west end of}} Fishergate (then Preston’s major thoroughfare). It was on a slope so steep <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> station staff had to push trains out of the station.|$|E
5|$|A 1991 {{agreement}} between the City of Portland and the State of Oregon to dramatically reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) led to Portland's Big Pipe Project. The project, part of a related series of Portland CSO projects completed in late 2011 {{at a cost of}} $1.44billion, separates the city's sanitary sewer lines from storm-water inputs <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> overwhelmed the combined system during heavy rains. When that occurred, some of the raw sewage in the system flowed into the river instead of into the city's wastewater treatment plant. The Big Pipe project and related work reduces CSO volume on the lower river by about 94percent.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, and just {{opposite}} his own tomb, Ramesses enlarged the earlier small tomb {{of an unknown}} Eighteenth Dynasty noble (KV5) for his numerous sons. With 120 known rooms, and excavation work still underway, it is probably the largest tomb in the valley. Originally opened (and robbed) in antiquity, it is a low-lying structure that has been particularly prone to the flash floods <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> hit the area. Tonnes of debris and material has washed in over the centuries, ultimately concealing its vast size. It is not currently open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Borden {{launches}} a solo magic career and hires the silent, mysterious Fallon as his ingénieur. Borden courts and eventually marries Sarah, who {{gives birth to}} their daughter, Jess; but their relationship is shadowed by Sarah's intuition that Borden is keeping secrets and <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> he is lying {{when he says he}} loves her. At his first show, Borden's bullet catch trick is sabotaged by Angier, and Borden loses two fingers. Angier launches his own magic career, hiring Olivia Wenscombe as his assistant and Cutter as his ingénieur. During the finale of Angier's show, a disguised Borden sabotages Angier's bird cage act, which maims an audience member and ruins Angier's reputation.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{personal}} appearance—Nordic features, {{blond hair}} and blue eyes—changed radically {{over the course of}} time. As a young man, he dressed like a dandy in costly suits, sporting well-groomed hair and beard, indulging gourmet taste, making frequent visits to the theatre and the opera and visiting his project sites in a horse carriage. The older Gaudí ate frugally, dressed in old, worn-out suits, and neglected his appearance to the extent <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> he was taken for a beggar, such as after the accident that caused his death.|$|E

5|$|Hydrothermal {{alteration}} {{of the central}} lava dome and iron-bearing deposits has generated alunite, anatase, chlorite, copper veinlets, gypsum, illite, jarosite, labradorite, quartz, rutile, sanidine, smectite, and sulfur. Some of these minerals forms veins inside the rock. Silification is prominent and has formed cristobalite and tridymite. Elemental sulfur is also found. Vast regions of the volcano have been altered hydrothermally at temperatures of , giving the rock a clear appearance. Minor exhalation deposits are {{also found in the}} form of sulfates <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> conserve conduits. Red-coloured alteration halos occur in andesites adjacent to iron deposits, probably due to iron input.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, workers' pay {{averaged}} between $11 and $18 per hour, {{depending on}} the position. With workweeks averaging between 70 and 84 hours per week, the problem for many workers became {{what to do with}} so much extra money. Teamster Jerry Thornhill, a typical worker, wrote to Money magazine, asking for advice. Thornhill detailed a pay rate of $57,000 per year at a time when members of Congress earned $42,500 annually, professional football players averaged $40,000, and U.S. vice president Nelson Rockefeller earned $62,500. The large amounts of money in the pipeline camps and a lack of entertainment caused frequent gambling games <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> involved tens of thousands of dollars. Instead of gambling, other workers saved their money for monthlong vacations to Hawaii or other warm climates, then returned to work with no money remaining.|$|E
5|$|In P. fimbriata from Queensland and in {{some other}} species, {{contests}} between males usually last only 5 to 10seconds, and only their legs make contact. Contests between Portia females are usually long and violent, and in P. fimbriata from Queensland these often including grappling <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> breaks a leg. A victor may evict a loser, and then eat the loser's eggs and take over the loser's web. Unlike in some other Portia species, victorious females of P. fimbriata from Queensland do not kill and eat the losers.|$|E

The Bowl Alliance matched up the conference champions of the Big East, Southeastern Conference, Big 12 Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, and two at-large teams in games to determine an official national champion. Prior {{to the introduction of}} the Bowl Alliance and its predecessor, the Bowl Coalition, national champions were determined by various {{college football}} polls <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> named different teams as champion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1909, Bryant moved to Portland, first sharing a {{downtown}} apartment {{with one of her}} college friends, Clara Wold, then renting her own apartment in the same building. Among her jobs, she designed a stained-glass window for the Povey Brothers, worked as a freelance reporter for The Oregonian, and became an illustrator and society editor for the Portland Spectator, a weekly news magazine. Meanwhile, she formed friendships with people—such as Cas Baer, drama editor for The Oregonian—who were interested in journalism and the arts. In late 1909, she met and married Paul Trullinger, a dentist who lived on a houseboat on the Willamette River, collected art, and liked drinking parties <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> included invitations to his office to inhale ether.|$|E
5|$|Mills and workers' {{settlements}} {{were established}} at Belper, Darley Abbey, and Milford by Arkwright's competitors. Arkwright-type mills were so successful <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> they were copied without paying royalties to Richard Arkwright. The cotton {{industry in the}} Derwent Valley went into decline {{in the first quarter}} of the 19th century as the market shifted towards Lancashire which was better position in relation to markets and raw materials. The mills and their associated buildings are well preserved and have been reused since the cotton industry declined. Many of the buildings within the World Heritage Site are also listed buildings and Scheduled Monuments. Some of the mills now contain museums and are open to the public.|$|E
