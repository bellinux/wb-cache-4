40|$|The present {{invention}} {{provides a}} power assisted <b>actuator</b> <b>assembly</b> for flexing restraints {{in response to}} movement of an underlying member or a controller. The <b>actuator</b> <b>assembly</b> generally includes a flexible member, such as a cord or fabric panel, having a first end coupled to the restraint and a second end coupled to a drive member, such as a drive roller or winch. The drive member, which may be located remotely or locally, pulls on the flexible member to flex the restraint. The <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies</b> are useful in many applications, including space suit gloves and compliant robot arms...|$|R

40|$|Variable camber <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{broaden the}} range of speeds at which lift to drag {{performance}} is maximized for slotted flap wings. Lift is improved over {{a broader range of}} cruising speeds by varying wing camber with rotational flap movements that do not introduce wing slots and induced drag. Forward flaps are secured to forward flange links which extended from, and are a part of forward flap linkage assemblies. The forward flaps rotate about flap pivots with their rotational displacement controlled by variable camber <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies</b> located between the forward flaps and the forward flange links. Rear flaps are held relative to the forward flaps by rear flap linkage assemblies which may act independently from the forward flap linkage assemblies and the variable camber <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Wing camber is varied by rotating the flaps with the variable camber <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies</b> while the flaps are in a deployed or tucked position. Rotating the flaps in a tucked position does not introduce significant wing surface discontinuities, and reduces aircraft fuel consumption on most flight profiles...|$|R

40|$|Evidence of {{propellant}} leakage across ball-valve {{shaft seals}} {{has been noted}} during the disassembly of five flight engines and one test engine at the NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, White Sands Test Facility. Based on data collected during the disassembly of these five engines, the consequences of propellant leakage across the ball-valve shaft seals {{can be divided into}} four primary areas of concern: Damage to the ball-valve pinion shafts, damage to sleeved bearings inside the ball-valve and <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies,</b> degradation of the synthetic rubber o-rings used in the <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies,</b> and corrosion and degradation to the interior of the <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The exact time at which leakage across the ball-valve shaft seals occurs has not been determined, however, the leakage most likely occurs during engine firings when, depending on the specification used, ball-valve cavity pressures range as high as 453 to 550 psia. This potential pressure range for the ball-valve cavities greatly exceeds the acceptance leakage test pressure of 332 psia. Since redesign and replacement of the ball-valve shaft seals is unlikely, the near term solution to prevent damage that occurs from shaft-seal leakage is to implement a routine overhaul and maintenance program for engines in the fleet. Recommended repair, verification, and possible preventative maintenance measures are discussed in the paper...|$|R

40|$|The {{vibrational}} {{power flow}} in a double-beam system is investigated theoretically and experimentally in this paper. A novel large displacement piezoelectric <b>actuator</b> <b>assembly,</b> comprising two curved THUNDER actuators, {{is used to}} connect the two beams and provide both passive and active isolation at the same time. A simulation model is proposed to describe the coupled mechanical and electrical properties of the new <b>actuator</b> <b>assembly.</b> Modal expansion approach is used to study the power transmissions between the two beams which are mechanically and electrically coupled via the actuator mounts. The effectiveness of both active and passive isolation has been investigated. The optimal control voltage for each actuator is obtained by minimizing the time-averaged power transmitted into the receiver beam.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design and {{modelling}} of a novel <b>actuator</b> <b>assembly,</b> in which two THUNDER actuators are put in a clamshell configuration. A simulation model is proposed to describe the mechanical and electrical properties of the <b>actuator</b> <b>assembly</b> {{on the basis of}} parameters that can be measured by experiments. In order to validate the model, a system comprising a flexible cantilever beam connected to an actuator is discussed numerically and experimentally. Results show that the novel actuator configuration and the model developed in this paper work very well in the low frequency range. Meanwhile, it is observed that the dynamics of the actuator has an obvious effect on the response of the whole system near the natural frequencies of the actuator itself. Considering the fact that active isolation mainly targets the low frequency range, the established model can serve the purpose and be easily integrated into any closed-loop control simulations.

When the mainstage signal was received, pneumatic pressure was applied against the gas generator control valve <b>actuator</b> <b>assembly</b> which moved the piston and opened the fuel poppet. During the fuel poppet opening, an actuator contacted the piston that opened the oxidizer poppet. As the opening pneumatic pressure decayed, spring loads closed the poppets.|$|R

Life tests were done in dry nitrogen at 50 C. To investigate the MLS-AAA life test anomaly, Spiral Orbit Tribometer (SOT) accelerated tests were performed. SOT results indicated greatly reduced relative lifetimes of Pennzane formulations in contact with 17 - 4 PH steel compared to 440 C stainless steel. Also, dry nitrogen tests yielded longer relative lifetimes than comparable ultrahigh vacuum tests. Generally, oxidized Pennzane formulations yielded shorter lifetimes than non-oxidized lubricant.

40|$|This {{paper will}} show a {{conceptual}} new material platform for dielectric elastomer actuators (DEA). The working principle of DEAs is based to {{the displacement of}} a flexible insulating dielectric which is placed between two electrodes. If an electrical voltage is applied, an electrostatic pressure will be generated, which forces the elastic material to stretch. State of the art actuators exhibit non-flexible metallic or graphite electrodes. The difference in flexibility leads to material incompatibilities and reduces the durability and long-term stability of <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The new material platform consists of only one basic polymer for all layers. Ceramic fillers were used to obtain a higher permittivity of the dielectric layer. The electrode layer was modified with nanoscale fillers like Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) to reach the needed specific conductivity. The newly developed material and actuator platform showed outstanding results regarding displacement, durability and long-term stability. The durability and long-term stability were demonstrated successfully using several mechanical and electro-mechanical stress tests with up to millions of load cycles...|$|R

40|$|The digital {{revolution}} has fundamentally changed our lives by giving us {{new ways to}} express ourselves through digital media. For example, accessible multimedia content creation tools allow people to instantiate their ideas and share them easily. However, most of these outcomes only exist on-screen and online. Despite the growing accessibility of digital design and fabrication tools the physical world and everyday objects surrounding us have been largely excluded from a parallel explosion of possibilities to express ourselves. Increasingly, webbased services allow professional and non-professional audiences to access computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) tools like 3 D-printing and laser-cutting. Nonetheless, there are few (if any) design tools and methods for creating complex mechanical assemblies that {{take full advantage of}} CAM systems. Creating unique mechatronic artifacts or "originalMachines" requires more specific and sophisticated design tools than exist today. "Object-Oriented Mechatronics" is a parametric design approach that connects knowledge about mechanical assemblies and electronics with the requirements of digital manufacturing processes. Parametric instances like gears, bearing and servos are made available as objects within a CAD environment which can then be implemented into specific projects. The approach addresses the missing link between accessible rapid-manufacturing services and currently available design tools thereby creating new opportunities for self-expression through mechatronic objects and machines. The dissertation matches mechanical components and assemblies with rapid manufacturing methods by exploring transferability of conventional manufacturing techniques to appropriate rapid manufacturing tools. I rebuild various gearing and bearing principles like four-contact point bearings, cross roller bearings, spur and helical gears, planetary gears, cycloidal and harmonic gear reducers using the laser cutter, the CNC-mill and the 3 D-printer. These explorations lead to more complex assemblies such as the PlywoodServo, 3 DprintedClock and 3 -DoF (Degree of Freedom) Head. The lessons from these explorations are summarized in a detailed "cook book" of novel mechatronic assemblies enabled by new fabrication tools. Furthermore, I use the results to develop a CAD tool that brings together several existing software packages and plug-ins including Rhino, Grasshopper and the Firefly experiments for Arduino, which will allow animation, fabrication and control of original machines. The tool is an example of an object-oriented design approach to mechatronic assemblies. A user calls a DoF (Degree of Freedom) object (parametric servo) with specific parameters like gearing and bearing types, motor options and control and communication capabilities. The DoF object then creates the corresponding geometry which can be connected and integrated with other actuators and forms. A group of roboticists and designers participated in a workshop to test the tool and make proposals for original machines using the tool. The dissertation has contributions on multiple levels. First, the <b>actuator</b> <b>assembly</b> examples and parametric design tool present a body of novel work that illustrates the benefits of going beyond off-the-shelf <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies</b> and kit-of-parts for robotic objects. Second, this tool and the accompanying examples enable the design of more original machines with custom <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies</b> using the latest digital fabrication tools. Finally, these explorations illustrate how new CAD/ CAM tools can facilitate an exchange between more design-oriented users and more engineering-oriented users. by Peter Schmitt. Thesis (Ph. D.)
