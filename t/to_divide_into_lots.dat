50|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, the large land {{area of the}} Tyresö estate began <b>to</b> be <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>lots,</b> and summer cottages began to be built. Some quite luxurious ones {{were built in the}} Brevik area. The rate of {{construction}} increased rapidly {{in the early decades of}} the century. From the 1950s onwards, the summer cottages began to be converted into year-round dwellings at a rapid pace.|$|R
50|$|On September 26, Dalhousie {{presented}} Colonel By, (overseer of {{the construction}} of the Rideau Canal) with a letter authorizing him <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> the land <b>into</b> <b>lots,</b> and sod was turned. Construction of the canal's entrance took place in 1827, dividing Upper Town from Lower town.|$|R
50|$|The Territorial Legislature {{located the}} new school in Edmond, {{provided}} certain conditions were met. First, Oklahoma County had to donate $5,000 in bonds, and Edmond had to donate 40 acre of land within one mile (1.6 km) of the town; the land was eventually donated by Anton Classen. Ten of those acres had to be set aside for {{the new school}}. The remaining land had <b>to</b> be <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>lots</b> which would be sold {{to raise money for the}} new school. On October 1, 1891 Richard Thatcher was elected the 1st President of Territorial Normal School of Oklahoma.|$|R
25|$|On October 8, 1917, a {{resolution}} was passed <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> a section <b>into</b> <b>lots</b> for family use and to issue certificates of purchase {{at the time}} the full payment was received. The trustees also approved that only parishioners could purchase lots and only Greek Catholics could be buried in the cemetery, with the exception of family members who might be Roman Catholic.|$|R
50|$|Colonel Ward had the {{business}} sense and foresight to purchase 160 acres which {{he considered the}} logical and most acceptable site for Champaign's county seat. He approached the county commissioners with a proposition to locate {{the seat of the}} new county on this tract. Ward suggested that site <b>to</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> 212 <b>lots</b> and 22 out-lots, half of which, selected alternately, were to be given to the county and while Ward would retain the remainder. Ward also offered two lots for a cemetery and a tract for the public square. The county commissioners approved the proposal, and Ward, with Joseph C. Vance, entered into a written agreement on October 11, 1805. Ward named the new county seat, Urbana.|$|R
2500|$|The {{real estate}} {{promoters}} who created Woodside were mostly of German extraction. [...] Members of the Kelly family were first, followed by Alpheus P. Riker, Henry G. Schmidt, John A. Mecke, and Emil Cuntz. [...] The Kelly family developed the property where they resided {{while the others}} bought land specifically <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> it <b>into</b> building <b>lots.</b> Riker came from a German family that had settled in Queens {{while it was still}} part of New Netherland.|$|R
5000|$|The {{official}} {{date of establishment}} was set by {{a decree}} that gave approval to the builder of the railway line <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> tha lands <b>into</b> <b>lots</b> for future sells.

Between 1895 and 1915 the [...] "Compañía de los Ferrocarriles Pobladores" [...] and the French Bank that owned lands in the zone, sold them to families that quickly arrived to the region and settled the area.|$|R
50|$|But the {{de minimis}} {{principle}} also provides {{an incentive for}} authorities <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> contracts <b>into</b> separate <b>lots</b> {{for the purpose of}} avoiding bothersome procedures. Although the Directives prohibit doing this, such avoidance of procurement law is difficult to detect and enforce (as of 2007 no case relating to it had ever been before the ECJ), and it is thought to be mainly responsible for the observed low percentage of all public contracts that are published in the Official Journal.|$|R
50|$|The New Zealand Company in London {{planned the}} {{settlement}} of Nelson. They intended to buy cheaply from the Māori some 200000 acre which they planned <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> <b>into</b> one thousand <b>lots</b> and sell (at a considerable profit) to intending settlers. The Company earmarked future profits to finance the free passage of artisans and labourers and their families, and {{for the construction of}} public works. However, by September 1841 only about one third of the lots had sold. Despite this the Colony pushed ahead, and land was surveyed by Frederick Tuckett.|$|R
50|$|Champaign County {{was formed}} on February 20, 1805 {{following}} the American Revolution and the Northwest Indian War. Colonel William Ward, a Virginian who {{had settled in}} the Mad River Valley with Simon Kenton in 1799, purchased 160 acres which he considered the logical and most acceptable site for Champaign's county seat. He approached the county commissioners with a proposition to locate {{the seat of the}} new county on this tract.

50|$|Scotia is {{a company}} town which was {{previously}} wholly owned by the Pacific Lumber Company (PALCO). While {{it is home to}} approximately 800 past or present mill employees and their dependents, a process is underway <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> the homes <b>into</b> <b>lots</b> for sale. Located in northwestern California's Humboldt County, its partially wooded hillside near the Eel River is highlighted by the sheer size of mammoth lumber mill buildings located between the town and the river. Via U.S. Route 101, the town is 28 mi south of Eureka, California and 244 mi north of San Francisco.|$|R
50|$|Squier {{took pride}} in the country estate he built shortly after {{purchasing}} land between 36th and 41st Streets, Troost and The Paseo, outfitting it with a suitable residence, formal landscaping, a fishpond and deer park. Squier was aware that the Kansas City limits were moving further south and east, closer to his property. Seeing an opportunity, Squier began <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> his land <b>into</b> <b>lots</b> {{in the hopes of}} creating a residential development. But by 1900 {{only a small number of}} lots had dwellings constructed upon them, mostly north of what is now 37th Street.|$|R

50|$|The first dweller of Ipanema was Oswaldo Coufal, who {{acquired}} a big property in order <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> it <b>into</b> land <b>lots.</b> Coufal {{and his family}} loved Rio de Janeiro, where they used to spend theirs holidays. For this reason the neighbourhood was named after Ipanema in Rio de Janeiro, whose beach is famous worldwide. Despite the mutual names, these two places are quite different from each other: the one from Rio is home to luxury apartament blocks overseing {{the sea and the}} one from Porto Alegre, to middle class houses and some few upper middle class and upper class houses near Guaíba Lake.|$|R
5000|$|The {{construction}} of this rail service {{led directly to}} the division of property near train stations <b>into</b> small <b>lots</b> for {{construction of}} houses for working-class families. The area that would become Woodside {{was not the first}} community to grow out of Queens farmland. Before the end of the 1850s Woodhaven, Astoria, Maspeth, Corona, Hunters Point, and Winfield all attracted land speculators. Woodside's developers were, however, among the first <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> properties <b>into</b> <b>lots</b> for construction of small homes for working-class families. In doing so they were the first to use a set of new sales techniques to lure buyers. And they were the first to apply a name to a locale which emphasized its real or supposed virtues. A late 19th century author said [...] "Woodside" [...] was an appropriate name for the community these land speculators created. He maintained that others, created later, were [...] "without the slightest significance, historic or otherwise, and of the kind apparently chosen by boarding school girls to roll romantically from the tongue.". [...] These included Ozone Park, Corona, Winfield, Glendale, Laurel Hill, Elmhurst, and Linden Hill.|$|R
50|$|The {{death of}} J.W. Dixon junior in 1890 caused {{the hall and}} its grounds <b>to</b> be <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> 14 <b>lots</b> and {{auctioned}} off. Sheffield Corporation (now Sheffield City Council) bought Lot 1, which included the hall and the surrounding 50 acre of land. A northern section of the estate {{on the far side}} of the River Don was sold to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club which needed a new home ground as the lease on their Olive Grove ground had expired. Lands on the western side of the estate were sold to build Hillsborough Trinity Methodist Church and to accommodate new housing as the city of Sheffield expanded. The streets that these new houses were built on were named Dixon, Wynyard, Willis, Lennox, and Shepperson, all names connected to the Dixon family.|$|R
5000|$|In 1737, Stephanus Umbenhauer immigrated from Bern, Switzerland, and {{purchased}} 220 acre from Thomas Penn. In 1819, Stephanus' grandson, Johann Thomas Umbenhauer, set aside 46 acre <b>to</b> be <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> 62 <b>lots.</b> On 24 August 1819, Peter Bennethum bought {{the first six}} lots. In January 1820, the town was named Bernville after Stephanus' birthplace. The first house was built by Philip Filbert in 1820. In 1828, the Union Canal was completed, connecting the Susquehanna and Schuylkill rivers. Union Canal guard lock #36 and Lock #36 with a lift of 5.0 ft {{is located at the}} southwest corner of Bernville, near where Northkill Creek empties into Tulpehocken Creek. An historic marker on Route 183 states: [...] "The canal, at this point, followed the north bank of the Tulpehocken. A dam, two locks, and a mule bridge made it possible for boats to cross Northkill Creek. Nearby were grist mills, a lime kiln, and a tannery." [...] Due to the proximity of the Bernville Locks and the town's location on the canal, Bernville was a primary and prospering canal port.|$|R
5000|$|Records {{indicate}} that by 1654, county court {{was conducted at}} the house of John Hammond in the area known as [...] "Newtown" [...] or [...] "Newtowne Hundred". During the late 17th century, it appears that court was held at various homes throughout Newtown, and that it wasn't until 1708 that an official town with a designated courthouse was established. It was during this same year that Phillip Lynes, then Mayor of St. Mary's City, Maryland's Colonial Capital, designated fifty acres of land at the head of [...] "Brittons Bay" [...] <b>to</b> be <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> 100 <b>lots.</b> He further ordered that one lot be set aside for a county courthouse to be built at an expense not to exceed 12,000 pounds of tobacco. At this time, Newtown was promptly renamed Seymour Town in honor of Governor John Seymour. Nearly 20 years later, Seymour Town was renamed again to Leonard Town in honor of Benedict Leonard Calvert, who was Maryland's Governor during this period. In the decades that followed, Leonard Town became the place where local residents conducted their official business with the colony. Farm products were regularly shipped through the port.|$|R
5000|$|The first European {{survey of}} the Rideau Route, part of an {{indigenous}} canoe route that connected the Ottawa River to the St. Lawrence River at Gananoque, was conducted by Lt. Gershom French in 1783. On October 2, 1783, his survey party camped {{on the shores of}} the Rideau River {{at the head of the}} portage from the Ottawa River that led around Rideau Falls. He described the area as [...] "the soil everywhere good and deep, timbered with Maple, Elm and Butternut". The War of 1812 made evident the need for a safe military supply route from Montreal to Kingston so the Rideau Route was surveyed for the purposes of a canal, in 1816 by Royal Engineer Joshua Jebb and in 1823-24 by civil surveyor Samuel Clowes. In 1826, Lieutenant-Colonel John By was appointed to oversee its construction and he hired contractors that included Philemon Wright, who supplied much of the stone, mortar and labour, Thomas McKay, a mason, and staff such as John MacTaggart and Thomas Burrowes, surveyor, (Burrowes' created many paintings of early Bytown.) The Governor General George Ramsay, the Earl of Dalhousie took a great interest in the construction of the canal, as well as in establishing a settlement in the area. On September 26, 1826, Colonel By and Dalhousie had agreed that the canal's entrance was to be at Entrance Bay (its current location), and along with a letter authorizing Colonel By <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> the town <b>into</b> <b>lots,</b> marked the origins of what was to become the town of Bytown.|$|R

6000|$|It {{happened}} {{that when the}} Bawcombes settled at Doveton, just as Mr. Ellerby had taken to the shepherd, making a friend of him, so Mrs. Ellerby took to the shepherd's wife, and fell {{into the habit of}} paying frequent visits to her in her cottage. She was a very handsome woman, of a somewhat stately presence, dignified in manner, and she wore her abundant hair in curls hanging on each side to her shoulders--a fashion common at that time. From the first she appeared to take a particular interest in the Bawcombes, and they could not but notice that she was more gracious and friendly towards them than to the others of their station on the farm. The Bawcombes had three children then, aged six, four, and two years respectively, all remarkably healthy, with rosy cheeks and black eyes, and they were merry-tempered little things. Mrs. Ellerby appeared much taken with the children; praised their mother for always keeping them so clean and nicely dressed, and wondered how she could manage it on their small earnings. The carter and his wife lived in a cottage close by, and they, too, had three little children, and next to the carter's was the bailiff's cottage, and he, too, was married and had children; but Mrs. Ellerby never went into their cottages, and the shepherd and his wife concluded that it was because in both cases the children were rather puny, sickly-looking little things and were never very clean. The carter's wife, too, was a slatternly woman. One day when Mrs. Ellerby came in to see Mrs. Bawcombe the carter's wife was just going out of the door, and Mrs. Ellerby appeared displeased, and before leaving she said, [...] "I hope, Mrs. Bawcombe, {{you are not going to}} mix too freely with your neighbours or let your children go too much with them and fall into their ways." [...] They also observed that when she passed their neighbours' children in the lane she spoke no word and appeared not to see them. Yet she was kind to them too, and whenever she brought a big parcel of cakes, fruit, and sweets for the children, which she often did, she would tell the shepherd's wife <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> it <b>into</b> three <b>lots,</b> one for her own children and the others for those of her two neighbours. It was clear to see that Mrs. Ellerby had grown fond of her children, especially of the eldest, the little rosy-cheeked six-year-old boy. Sitting in the cottage she would call him to her side and would hold his hand while conversing with his mother; she would also bare the child's arm just for the pleasure of rubbing it with her hand and clasping it round with her fingers, and sometimes when caressing the child in this way she would turn her face aside to hide the tears that dropped from her eyes.|$|R
50|$|As a result, by 1801 {{the town}} had been {{surveyed}} and <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>lots,</b> but settlers did not begin to arrive until 1802.
