50|$|Well-known railcar mover brands in North America include <b>Trackmobile,</b> Rail King and Shuttlewagon.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{manufacturers}} produce railcar movers, {{in multiple}} countries. The first railcar mover {{was built by}} Whiting Corporation, now <b>Trackmobile</b> in 1948.|$|E
50|$|In 1950 Marshall {{wondered}} if other companies {{might be interested}} in a Mule. He put one on a trailer and took it around the country, demonstrating the advantages of a mobile railcar mover. Since then, more than 10,000 <b>Trackmobile</b> units have been put into service in 54 countries.|$|E
5000|$|African Rail & Traction Services (ARTS) specialises in the purchase, {{overhaul}} and lease of locomotives, <b>trackmobiles</b> {{and other}} rolling stock. It operates {{out of a}} workshop complex in Pretoria. It owns and hires out its own fleet of tractive power which consists of in the main, Electro-Motive Diesel, General Electric, Hunslet and Funkey locomotives. It has purchased locomotives from as far afield as Australia.|$|R
5000|$|The vessels Bali Sea and Banda Sea operate {{between the}} two ports up to four times a week. Having been {{originally}} built with a single cargo deck, the vessels were limited to carrying rail cars on their main deck. In 2004, CGR contracted Naval Architects Bennett & Associates to increase the vessels' carrying capacity by adding a second deck. Bennett & Associates also designed an articulating ramp at each dock to allow rail cars to be loaded on both decks. [...] The CGR transports approximately 10,000 railcars annually. Railcar loading and unloading is performed by the Terminal Railway Alabama State Docks at Mobile and by Ferrocarril del Sureste at Coatzacoalcos. The railroad operates two <b>trackmobiles</b> at each port to help with loading and unloading of railcars.|$|R
50|$|The {{museum has}} a smaller General Electric 23 ton diesel {{electric}} locomotive built in 1941. This unit was originally {{used by the}} US Army and US Air Force before being purchased by SaskPower for use on the A. L. Cole site. This is augmented with a Canadian Pacific <b>Trackmobile</b> built by Whiting Corporation in 1957.|$|E
50|$|ASM&L gave up its charter as a {{railroad}} and merged into Davidson Mineral Properties on November 19, 1997, and the Pine Mountain line was pulled up {{leaving only the}} line into the Big Ledge quarry. The ASM&L's locomotive was moved to another Hanson quarry before being replaced for in-plant use by a <b>Trackmobile.</b> It is still operated by CSX.|$|E
50|$|In 1975, DO {{purchased}} the Fonda, Johnstown and Gloversville Railroad (FJG) {{and managed to}} turn it around into a profitable operation. The recession of the early 1980s took its toll, and the railroad was shut down in 1984. A final run with a <b>Trackmobile</b> was made in 1988 to clear the line of any remaining railroad equipment. Most of the FJ&G route has been converted into a rail trail.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trackmobile</b> is a {{well-known}} railcar mover worldwide and began as an in-plant project at Whiting Corporation, Harvey, Illinois. In 1947 a young ex Navy fighter pilot and engineer named Marshall Hartelius was assigned to modify an old industrial locomotive Whiting had used for years inside their plant. Their locomotive was constantly being trapped on dead-end tracks, losing hours of productivity. Hartelius was charged {{to find a way}} to move it by road to avoid bottlenecks to railcar movements. He first designed a road wheel system to mount on the locomotive, but found it was cumbersome and complicated. Furthermore, in spite of the added utility of road-to-rail capability, the locomotive consumed a lot of fuel and oil and required constant repair. Marshall scrapped his first design and in its place submitted to his boss a concept for a vehicle specifically designed for in-plant rail movement. It had hard rubber tires to move by road and flanged steel wheels to work on rail.|$|E
50|$|As {{the next}} few decades past {{following}} the abandonment of passenger service, freight business continued. With the collapse of the leather business and other industry leaving, traffic declined to the point of the FJ&G closing down after 104 years of private ownership in January 1974. The Delaware Otsego Corporation acquired the line in 1974, but after only a decade of ownership the Delaware Otsego System abandoned the line in 1984. A <b>trackmobile</b> formed one last train that traveled the line collecting any equipment left on the dormant line in 1988, and the tracks were removed 2 years later. Some of the right of way was turned into a recreational trail from just south of the city of Johnstown to Denny's Crossing near Broadalbin Junction. Another small portion near Vail Mills has also been converted to trail use, but the remainder of the original and now trackless FJ&G has remained unchanged for over 2 decades due to lack of funding, land disputes, and lack of interest. A small portion of the roadbed south of the city of Johnstown was built on by the Wal-Mart Distribution Center and the right of way in Vail Mills near routes 30 and 29 is soon to be altered with the intersection being converted to a traffic circle.|$|E
