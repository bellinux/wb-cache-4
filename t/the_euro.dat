5|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> {{has led to}} extensive discussion about its possible effect on inflation. In the short term, there was a widespread impression in {{the population of the}} eurozone that the {{introduction of}} <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> had led to an increase in prices, but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies. A study of this paradox found that this was due to an asymmetric effect of the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> on prices: while it had no effect on most goods, it had an effect on cheap goods which have seen their price round up after the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>euro.</b> The study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased. It has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the introduction, retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> to do so.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately, {{there is}} also a cost in {{structurally}} keeping inflation lower than in the United States, UK, and China. The result is that seen from those countries, <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> has become expensive, making European products increasingly expensive for its largest importers.

This {{is one of the main}} reasons why economic growth inside <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> zone now lags behind growth in other large economies.
