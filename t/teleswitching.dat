50|$|The {{specific}} {{times when}} Economy 7 applies vary between different regions, seasons, and sometimes individual meters. For example, the seven-hour period might start at 1.30am during British Summer Time and 12:30am during Greenwich Mean Time (winter). Some regions use radio <b>teleswitching</b> to control consumers' systems and vary the timing. This uses data superimposed on the 198 kHz BBC Radio 4 long-wave signal.|$|E
50|$|Although each message will be {{received}} by all installed <b>teleswitches,</b> the unique user and group-codes carried by the message ensure that only <b>teleswitches</b> carrying the same combination of codes will act on it.|$|R
50|$|A radio <b>teleswitch</b> is {{a device}} {{used in the}} United Kingdom to allow {{electricity}} suppliers to switch large numbers of electricity meters between different tariffs, by broadcasting an embedded signal in broadcast radio signals. Radio <b>teleswitches</b> are also used to switch on/off consumer appliances {{to make use of}} cheaper baseload tariffs, such as economy 7.|$|R

50|$|The Radio <b>Teleswitch</b> Service (RTS) has {{its origins}} in the energy {{management}} projects initiated in the United Kingdom by the Electricity Council in the early 1980s. Three projects investigated the feasibility of using the telephone network, the distribution network and national radio for large scale energy management purposes. The radio <b>teleswitch</b> project was chaired by Walter Waring, deputy chairman of Eastern Electricity, {{and supported by the}} BBC.|$|R

50|$|The Radio 4 LW signal {{also carries}} radio data encoded using phase modulation, giving a time-of-day signal, and radio <b>teleswitch</b> control signals for Economy 7 electric-heating systems.|$|R
50|$|A 50 kW longwave {{transmitter}} transmitting a 1000 Hz wide signal {{could take}} over the <b>teleswitch</b> role with adequate nationwide coverageâ€”but some legal provision {{would probably have to}} be made to make this possible.|$|R
50|$|The Radio <b>Teleswitch</b> Service is {{broadcast}} {{alongside the}} longwave output of BBC Radio 4 from the Droitwich Transmitting Station. This transmitter uses {{a pair of}} obsolete metre-long valves which are no longer manufactured anywhere in the world.|$|R
50|$|Each of {{the user}} {{companies}} (the RTS Users, or Service Providers) has its own database on the Central <b>Teleswitch</b> Control Unit (CTCU), which is an HP Integrity computer running OpenVMS on IA-64 for reliability and clustering technology to minimise downtime.|$|R
50|$|Some stations, for {{instance}} Droitwich transmitting {{station in the}} UK, derive their carrier frequencies from an atomic clock. They can be therefore used as frequency standards. Droitwich also broadcasts a low bit-rate data channel, using narrow-shift phase-shift keying of the carrier, for Radio <b>Teleswitch</b> Services.|$|R
50|$|In October 2011, the BBC {{admitted}} that the Droitwich transmitter, including Radio 4's longwave service and Radio <b>Teleswitch,</b> will cease to operate {{when one of the}} last two valves breaks, and no effort would be made to manufacture more nor to install a replacement longwave transmitter.|$|R
50|$|The {{database}} defines {{how each}} group of <b>teleswitches</b> belonging to the user-company will control the loads and meter registers connected to it. The CTCU uses the database and certain rules to generate and control a continuous string of messages, which is forwarded to the BBC for transmission.|$|R
50|$|The Central <b>Teleswitch</b> Control Unit (CTCU) {{system was}} updated in 2007 {{to replace the}} {{obsolete}} computing hardware with brand new, modern, fully supported equipment. The old DEC MicroVAX machines were replaced with HP Integrity 2660s. The operating system has also been upgraded to OpenVMS 8.4. No effort {{has been made to}} upgrade the obsolete transmitter hardware.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, night storage heaters {{are used}} to {{increase}} the load by about 5 GW to accommodate the nuclear programme. There is also a programme that allows industrial loads to be disconnected using circuit breakers triggered automatically by frequency sensitive relays fitted on site. This operates in conjunction with Standing Reserve, a programme using diesel generators. These can also be remotely switched using BBC Radio 4 Longwave Radio <b>teleswitch.</b>|$|R
40|$|As the {{penetration}} of weather-dependent embedded generation grows, {{the variations in}} apparent demand experienced by distribution network operators will become more extreme. A method for the autonomous control of domestic electricity demand and microgeneration is proposed using the established, but underdeveloped, radio <b>teleswitch</b> technology. The disadvantages of cost or carbon-emission based optimisation using this method are discussed and an alternative approach based on minimisation of exergy loss is described. Results obtained from a computer model demonstrate its potential contribution to the balancing of electricity supply and demand. Exergy Demand management Embedded generation...|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} of the 10 off peak hours {{is determined by the}} local distribution network operator rather than the electricity supply company and they vary across the 14 regions in the UK. Times are switched automatically, and it is common for the switching times to be locked to either GMT or BST when the meter is installed. Some metering systems use a radio <b>teleswitch</b> controlled by the supplier to vary switching times, and effect the Daylight Saving Time switchover twice a year. Economy 10 thus requires a special multi-tariff meter, different from an Economy 7 meter.|$|R
