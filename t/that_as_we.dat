He suggested that any conception of God we may have, we can conceive either of existing or of not existing. He believed that existence is not a quality (or perfection), so a completely perfect being need not exist. Thus, he claimed {{that it is not a}} contradiction to deny God's existence. Although this criticism is directed against a cosmological argument, similar to that of Samuel Clarke in his first Boyle Lecture, it has been applied to ontological arguments as well.|$|E
25|$|We {{can assume}} <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> write text left to right, we are {{increasing}} the 'address' on paper, as a processor would write bytes with increasing memory addresses − {{as in the}} adjacent table. On paper, the hex value 0a0b0c0d (written 168496141 in usual decimal notation) is big-endian style since we write the most significant digit first and the rest follow in decreasing significance. Mapping this number as a binary value to a sequence of 4 bytes in memory in big-endian style also writes the bytes {{from left to right}} in decreasing significance: 0Ah at +0, 0Bh at +1, 0Ch at +2, 0Dh at +3.|$|E
25|$|Speed of {{processing}} is another theory {{that has been}} raised to explain working memory deficits. As a result of various studies he has completed examining this topic, Salthouse argues <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> age our speed {{of processing}} information decreases significantly. It is this decrease in processing speed that is then responsible for our inability to use working memory efficiently as we age. The younger persons brain is able to obtain and process information at a quicker rate which allows for subsequent integration and manipulation needed to complete the cognitive task at hand. As this processing slows, cognitive tasks that rely on quick processing speed then become more difficult.|$|E

25|$|Most {{commentators}} associate Jaspers {{with the}} philosophy of existentialism, {{in part because he}} draws largely upon the existentialist roots of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, and in part because the theme of individual freedom permeates his work. In Philosophy (3 vols, 1932), Jaspers gave his view of the history of philosophy and introduced his major themes. Beginning with modern science and empiricism, Jaspers points out <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> question reality, we confront borders that an empirical (or scientific) method simply cannot transcend. At this point, the individual faces a choice: sink into despair and resignation, or take a leap of faith toward what Jaspers calls Transcendence. In making this leap, individuals confront their own limitless freedom, which Jaspers calls Existenz, and can finally experience authentic existence.|$|E
25|$|If any brother, being {{priest or}} deacon or {{of any other}} {{clerical}} order, shall commit any offense, and this shall come to {{the knowledge of the}} Prior or the Master, the brethren whom the Prior shall select for the court shall judge with righteous judgment and shall impose a penance of seven days or even of forty according to the gravity of the fault, just {{as in the case of}} other brethren who are not in holy orders. For, seeing that we are all of one religion and all, both clergy and laymen, make the same profession, it seems unfitting that there should be any distinction between brethren within the Hospital. Wherefore it is ordered <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> live under one rule, so also we ought to be subject to the same judges of the rule.|$|E
25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E

500|$|After {{being placed}} in {{detention}} together, Lana and Sky came {{to know each other}} better. They gradually formed a bond, and Lana developed feelings for Sky. Lana's crush on Sky eventually culminated in Neighbours first lesbian kiss. The episode featuring the kiss was broadcast in its usual 6.30pm G-rated timeslot. The executive producer of Neighbours, Ric Pellizzeri, said the storyline reflected reality and continued the show's move toward more contemporary issues. Pellizzeri explained that Neighbours was simply telling [...] "a story about tolerance." [...] The producer added that the kiss was as far as they would go, but the writers would not be discouraged from telling other stories about homosexuality in the future. On-screen, Sky told Lana that she was only interested in her boyfriend, but they remained friends. With her main storyline completed, Lana was seen attending the prom with a female admirer, before moving to Canada with her family. Script producer Luke Devenish told a reporter for the Sydney Star Observer, [...] "There is that great tradition that the lesbian is always dead in the final scene, and we were very aware of <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were writing her out.

[...] According to La Toya, Michael knew that she was forced to attack him in the press against her will and he did not blame her. [...] "He never held any of that against me, I remember when I'd got away from this total hell I'd been through where I'd been beaten, abused, controlled and forced to say those terrible things about Michael, which I didn't for a moment believe, he held out his arms and just hugged me.

Chatfield, now Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence, commented that Hitler had [...] "persuaded himself" [...] that Britain had provided the Reich with a [...] "free hand" [...] in Eastern Europe in exchange for the agreement. Chamberlain stated that Britain had never given such an understanding to Germany, and he commented that he first learned of Hitler's belief in such an implied bargain during his meeting with the Führer at the Berchtesgaden summit in September 1938. In a later paper to the Cabinet, Chatfield stated [...] "that we might say that we now understood Herr Hitler had in 1935 thought that we had given him a free hand in Eastern and Central Europe in return for his acceptance of the 100:35 ratio, but <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> could not accept the correctness of this view it might be better that the 1935 arrangements should be abrogated".|$|E

[...] (Even if these charges could be considered similar, this would not violate the {{double jeopardy}} clause in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as prosecutions under state and federal laws are considered distinct prosecutions.) [...] Justice La Forest wrote for the majority, [...] "I do not think our constitutional standards can be imposed on other countries." [...] The majority found that the charge would be in accordance with [...] "traditional procedures" [...] in Ohio. [...] Finally, it found that [...] "It is interesting <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> saw, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that successive prosecutions at the federal and state level do not automatically offend against the due process clause, the spirit and content of which bears some resemblance to s. 7 of the Charter, although the courts would act to prevent oppressive behaviour." ...|$|E
2500|$|The cast of V {{features}} {{a number of}} actors from other science-fiction series, including Lost, Firefly and Smallville. Peters has stated that the casting of so many actors from a science-fiction background was coincidental, explaining: [...] "Obviously, we went for the best actors we could possibly find. It's a nice bonus {{that a lot of}} these folks have appeared in genre shows in the past, but it was not designed that way. We also wanted to make sure <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> moved forward, we honoured and respected the characters and the themes that the (original) show envisioned, while introducing brand new characters and brand new themes that make sense in a post-9/11 world." [...] Mitchell was a fan of the original series as a child, recalling: [...] "I liked the escape of it; I liked the entertainment of it. It was a fun night for me. I was allowed to watch an hour of television with my parents, and we made a kind of celebration of it. I hope that other teenagers will do that with their parents with this show." [...] Mitchell's role in V sees her play an FBI agent with traits traditionally assigned to males. She commented: [...] "I like playing a traditional hero. I don't think I've ever done it before. Sigourney Weaver said she always chooses male roles because they are meatier." [...] Mitchell characterizes Erica as having [...] "a little bit of a hero complex", but [...] "her joy and her love and her true affection is with her son, and the fact that he is in imminent danger (makes it) fun to play." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1857, Oregon {{voters had}} {{supported}} statehood for Oregon and subsequently {{called for a}} constitutional convention. The emergent constitution contained 185 sections, 172 of which were copied from various other state constitutions, with the additions primarily racial exclusion or finance related. The document enshrined an Exclusion Law into Section 35 of the Bill of Rights within the Oregon State Constitution. The article read as follows:"No free negro or mulatto not residing in this state {{at the time of}} the adoption of this constitution, shall come, reside or be within this state or hold any real estate, or make any contracts, or maintain any suit therein; and the legislative assembly shall provide by penal laws for the removal by public officers of all such negroes and mulattoes, and for their effectual exclusion from the state, and for the punishment of persons who shall bring them into the state, or employ or harbor them."John R. McBride, later a state senator, described the amendment: [...] "It was largely an expression against any mingling of the white with any of the other races, and upon a theory <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> had yet no considerable representation of other races in our midst, we should do nothing to encourage their introduction. We were building a new state on virgin ground; its people believed it should encourage only the best elements to come to us, and discourage others." [...] The question of slavery itself was put to a popular vote, with the public voting against slavery (by a vote of 7727 to 2645) but in favor of racial exclusion policies [...] (by a vote of 8640 to 1081).

2500|$|Additionally, in Disciplining {{investment}} Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis and the Downsizing of [...] "Corporate America", Karen Ho states <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> {{continue to}} learn more about Wall Street, we learn about each independent banker. As the banker brings their life experiences into the business, we can see the reasons for their actions. Each investor has a unique identity which contributes to the culture of Wall Street. Ideally, they live in the moment. [...] However, job insecurity and the volatile nature of the market creates a constant state of fear within the investor. Therefore, they must organize themselves and follow a pattern to ensure security, profit and prosperity for the long run. Karen Ho wishes for us to see Wall Street through the lens of the everyday investor and banker, as well as understand the experiences and everyday situations that they must endure. Ho also believes that the individuals within the public can counteract the stereotypes and negativity that both the media and society associates with Wall Street by learning more about the personal experiences of the investors and their everyday lives. Similarly to regular wage earners, Wall Street employees are just trying to earn a day's pay. Their work is sometimes undervalued, because the public does not see them in this manner. Thus, Wall Street cannot be understood in black and white terms. One needs to understand that they have a value system which is not only logical to them, but also reflective of North America's values of individual power, prestige, and social practices based on individualism. For example, throughout the 1940s and into the 1950s Manhattan was a [...] "white-only" [...] community. [...] Within that time period, {{there was a lot of}} racial segregation. The values of America and the social practices were not like they are today, so African Americans were not within the Wall Street community.|$|E

While EMP Pad Limited said it did not pay Edmonds to promote the product, the company's owner Maria Robertson, previously worked as an assistant to the TV presenter and acknowledged having known Edmonds for 25 years and having worked with him and his daughter. Cancer Research UK produced an article to reassure the public that [...] "the best studies looking at this topic have failed to show a link between emotional stress and an increased risk of cancer" [...] and that [...] "no reliable evidence has ever been produced that Rife machines – or any similar devices producing low-frequency electromagnetic pulses – have any benefit for cancer patients. Nor have organisations that scrutinise new treatments and devices (like the US Food and Drug Authority or the European Medicines Agency) approved any as a therapy for any type of disease". Dr David Grimes, a cancer researcher at Oxford University, told ‘This Morning’: [...] "It’s not just untrue, it’s patronising and victim blaming, cancer is bad luck... the healthiest people in the world get cancer and it’s not because they are negative". Prof. John Gribben, Chair of Medical Oncology at Queen Mary University of London, said: “This is complete gibberish and undermines all the good work everyone does with evidence-based medicine and targeted approaches". Prof. Edzard Ernst, Emeritus Professor at the University Of Exeter said “The reason why most of us put ‘negative energy’ in inverted commas is simple: it is a pure figment of the imagination of fantasists. That would not be so bad except <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> see, some VIPs seem to take this nonsense seriously. The result might be that some desperate patients believe them, and choose the nonsense over the best that real medicine has to offer. And that could hasten deaths.” ...|$|E
