It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. <b>The</b> <b>amazing</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E

"The {{craft of}} politics," [...] he pointed out, [...] "makes but one inexorable demand upon her followers--the demand for unity. <b>The</b> <b>amazing</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{that this is}} not {{generally}} realised. It seems the fashion, nowadays, to dissent from everything, to cultivate the ego in its narrowest sense rather than to try and reach out and grasp the hands of those around. The fault, I think, is in an over-developed theatrical sense, the desire which so many clever men have for individual notoriety. We Democrats have prospered because we have been free from it. We have been able to sink our individual prejudices in our cause. That is because our cause has been great enough. We aim so high, we see so clearly, that it is rare indeed to find amongst us those individual differences which have been the ruin of every political party up to to-day. We have no Brown who will not serve with Smith, no Robinson who declines to be associated with Jones. We forget the small things which are repugnant to us in a fellowman, because of the great things which bind us together." ...|$|E

Seizing my pistol, I was rushing out, when my wife threw her arms round me and held me with convulsive strength. I tried to throw her off, but she clung to me most desperately. At last I got clear, but by the time I had opened the door and reached the house the creature was gone. He had left a trace of his presence, however, for there on the door was the very same arrangement of dancing men which had already twice appeared, and which I have copied on that paper.

5000|$|But Patsy was not {{the only}} one having {{problems}} at the session. Composer Harlan Howard relates, [...] On the night of the session, we absolutely did NOT want to do the standard 4:4 shuffle that had by then been done to death. We were trying all kinds of other (basic rhythm) combinations, but they all just laid there and bled all over the floor. So, it had to be the shuffle then, like it or not. But <b>the</b> <b>amazing</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was,</b> once Patsy got into the groove, she just caressed those lyrics and that melody so tenderly that it was just like satin. We knew we had magic in the can when, on the fourth take, every grown man in that studio was bawling like a baby and Bradley said `That's the one'. After listening to the playback afterward, however, she realized that Bradley was right about the torch songs and ended up liking the track, stating that she finally found her own identity. Subsequently, The Jordanaires became fast friends and part of Patsy's inner circle.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During the 1990 s, the Government of Peru {{began to}} aggressively privatize agriculture. The {{government}} stopped loaning money to farmers ’ cooperatives {{and closed the}} government rice-buying company. The govern-ment even rented out most of its research stations and many senior scientists lost their jobs. As part of this trend, the government eliminated its seed certification agency. Instead, private seed certification committees were set up with USAID funding and technical advise from a US university. The committees were supposed to become self-financing (by certifying seed grown by small seed producers) and each committee was supposed to encourage {{the development of a}} group of small seed-producing firms, clustered around the seed certification agency. <b>The</b> <b>amazing</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that many of the seed committees actually accomplished these goals. The agronomists who staffed the committees stood by their jobs, even after US funding ended, even though the committees ’ income was (at best) modest, and occasionally under the threat of violence from the extreme left. Some seed certification committees failed and others did not. Some of the problems with Peruvian agricultural liberalization can be seen in regard to the seed programs of maize, rice, potatoes, and beans. For example, the government abandoned most research, yet could not resist creating certain distortions in the seed market (e. g., buying large amounts of seed and distributing them for political ends) ...|$|E

40|$|We {{are faced}} with {{questions}} {{too big to fail}} and too big to answer. Most discussions on climate change are blocked; they are caught by catastrophism circulating in the horizon of the problem: what is climate change bad for? From a sociological point of view, because climate change is a threat to humanity, we can and should turn the question upside down and ask: what is climate change good for? <b>The</b> <b>amazing</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that if you firmly believe climate change is a fundamental threat to all of humanity, then that belief might bring a transformative, cosmopolitan turn in our contemporary life and the world might be changed for the better. This is what I call ‘emancipatory catastrophism’. The question then is: how might climate change save the world? First thesis: Climate change is the embodiment of the mistakes of a whole epoch of industrial capitalism, and climate risks pursue their acknowledgement and correction with all the violence of the possibility of annihilation. Global risks are a kind of collective return of the repressed, wherein the self-assurance of the industrial capitalism, organized in form of nation-state politics, is confronted with the source of its own errors as an objectified threat to its own existence. Thus the global risk of climate change is a kind of compulsive, collective memory of the fact that past decisions and mistakes are contained in what we find ourselves exposed to; and that even the highest degree of institutional reification is nothing but a reification that can be revoked – a borrowed mode of action which can, and must, be changed if it leads to self-jeopardization. Put differently, the sociological significance of climate change lies in th...|$|E

While we will certainly consider models of learning in animals (mostly as a precursor to human models),the purpose will be {{to learn more about}} human learning and memory. The goal of this course is to understand theories about how human beings learn (encode), store, and retrieve (remember) all of <b>the</b> <b>amazing</b> <b>things</b> we <b>are</b> able to remember. To do this (and to gain historical perspective), we will discuss the research experiments which led to these theories. To wit, it is important that you are able to read and understand psychological research articles and interpret results of experiments as supporting or refuting specific theories. Although several methods of instruction will be used in this course (including potential film and journal article discussions), lecture will be the primary means. You will read chapters in Eichenbaum’s (2008) Learning & Memory textbook in addition to reading and discussing several primary research articles. In addition to readings and class discussion, you will have several exams and one major research paper.

40|$|Twenty {{years ago}} federal cabinet began dealing with climate change, writes Joan Staples, but the {{momentum}} {{had been lost}} by the time Labor left office   THE STORY of how much progress was achieved in Australia on climate change policy in the 1980 s has been lost. Exactly twenty years ago, in 1989, federal cabinet first considered reducing greenhouse emissions by 20 per cent by 2005, and during the 1990 election campaign, they agreed, with some provisos, to a similar plan. At the same time, the Liberal Party was developing parallel policies, although Chris Puplick, the Liberal shadow environment minister at the time, argues that the Liberal Party was ahead of Labor on climate change, and on many other environment issues, at the 1990 election. The current political debate in Canberra assumes that the issue has only been discovered by politicians {{over the past few}} years. Yet climate change was clearly on the public policy agenda twenty years ago. The cabinet submission that the environment minister, Graham Richardson, introduced in 1989 was based on ten years of gradually developing understanding both internationally and in Australia among scientists, environmental activists and policy makers. It was in 1979 that the first World Climate Conference in Geneva expressed concern about a link between greenhouse gases and climate change. A year later, in 1980, the Australian Academy of Science held a conference to review twenty years of measurements showing increasing carbon dioxide levels. Although there was a growing understanding that the greenhouse effect would result in climate change, scientists were still cautious about making categorical statements based on the earliest models. The first major international statement on the issue came in 1985 at Villach in Austria, when a UN conference of scientists from twenty-nine countries assessed the growing evidence and released a statement calling for international action. Three years later, in 1988, came one of the key dates in the unfolding debate. It was in that year that an international conference in Toronto set the first targets, calling for a 20 per cent reduction of CO 2 emissions worldwide by the year 2005, with the brunt of this to be borne by developed countries using 1988 as the base year. These “Toronto targets” became important benchmarks worldwide. In Australia, the CSIRO was at the forefront of international research. In 1987 and 1988, in partnership with the Commission for the Future, the organisation conducted two major conferences on climate change. The published papers from the first are evidence of the high-quality, cutting-edge work that was being done by Australian scientists at the time. The Commission for the Future had been established by Science Minister Barry Jones in 1985 as a forum for exploring scientific, social and economic issues outside the constraints of short-term government planning. Jones attended the 1988 conference as minister responsible for the commission, and Graham Richardson opened the conference in his capacity as environment minister. Unusually for the time, the conference was actually a series of conferences in the state and territory capitals and Cairns, involving 8000 people and linked by video for a keynote address. “The network of conferences succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of the organisers,” according to Ian Lowe who was acting director of the Commission for the Future at the time. The 1988 conference publicised climate change widely. A number of the current affairs television programs took up the issue and the Melbourne Age published a four page lift-out. “State governments established working parties or inter-departmental committees to explore the local implications,” writes Lowe, “and the Brisbane City Council showed the way to local authorities by commissioning consultants to write a report on the issues affecting the city. ”Lowe did much to communicate the issue to the public, including numerous public speaking engagements and the publication of a book, Living in the Greenhouse. Although it was aimed at a general audience, the book drew together a vast amount of data, not just on climate science but also on how Australia could change its CO 2 output with minimum effect on lifestyle. The Australian Conservation Foundation employed a climate change campaigner to focus solely on the issue. The international calls for action by scientists and the UN were intensifying, with Australian scientists playing a leading role. The environment was being given a higher priority by the public, and the need for positive action on climate change had been taken up by the shadow environment minister, Chris Puplick. In the midst of this mounting interest, in 1989, Richardson quietly took a submission to federal cabinet proposing a reduction in greenhouse emissions by 20 per cent of 1988 levels by 2005 – the Toronto Target. Although Richardson’s initiative was rejected by the economic and resource ministers, 1989 did see a greenhouse statement, and research funding, from the prime minister. Later in the year, in the lead-up to a federal election, the government released a major environment statement, Our Country, Our Future, covering many traditional “green” issues but giving prominence to climate change. It supported international action, promised {{to look for ways to}} reduce carbon dioxide emissions – including cooperating with the states on transport use – and provided $ 350, 000 for public awareness and education. Significantly, after the 1990 election the Hawke cabinet did agree to a climate change submission similar to that sponsored by Richardson. It was in the context of an inducement to the environment movement to remain in negotiations known as the Ecologically Sustainable Development process. The environment movement was planning to withdraw from the process after the resource industries were granted significant changes; to encourage them to stay, the government proposed the Toronto targets on greenhouse emissions for a 20 per cent reduction of CO 2 emissions by the year 2005. The proposal was brought to cabinet by the new environment minister, Ros Kelly, and it was passed with a proviso that reduction of emissions would not be at the expense of the economy. With the succession of Keating to the position of prime minister the issue was allowed to lapse with no enabling legislation produced. But the historic and symbolic importance of the decision needs to be acknowledged. The last decade of the Howard government has obliterated the memory of progressive Liberal Party policies on the environment and climate change during the late 1980 s. Under shadow environment minister Chris Puplick, the Coalition had progressive environmental policies on a number of issues, challenging Labor and pushing the boundaries of the debate. Referring to these Coalition policies, Puplick has told me that: We were at one with [Labor] on CFC control and CFC emissions. We were ahead of them on the Antarctic. I, in fact, announced that we would oppose the signing of the Antarctic Minerals Treaty at a time when Richardson was advocating that we should sign the treaty. It was our coming out and saying we would sign the treaty that caused them to go back and revise their position that they would sign the Treaty. We were ahead of them on whaling issues – that was a legacy of Fraser’s long involvement. Importantly, he claims that the coalition was ahead of the Labor Party on global warming issues by the 1990 election, indicating that there was bipartisan interest in climate change as an issue. The reason for the bipartisanship arose out of the 1987 election, when even John Howard, the leader at the time, recognised that the Coalition had not performed well in relation to public expectations on the environment. After that election, Puplick was given relative freedom to develop policy – freedom which he exercised energetically, but which was nevertheless constrained by the party’s obsession with states’ rights. The bipartisanship was against the backdrop of high public interest in everything environmental, which was ushered in by the Franklin Dam decision in 1983 and peaked during Graham Richardson’s period as minister from 1987 to 1990. Philip Toyne and Simon Balderstone have argued that the Hawke government did “more to protect the environment than any national government before or since,” and were able to list eleven major achievements, including stopping the Franklin Dam, saving the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, introducing Landcare, establishing Kakadu Stages II and III, saving thousands of hectares of iconic forests such as Tasmania’s Lemonthyme, adding a vast area to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and declaring many new World Heritage areas. Environment ranked only second to the economy as a key issue at the 1990 election. <b>The</b> <b>amazing</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> how quickly government interest dissipated. Environmental issues did not figure in the 1993 election. A conjunction of factors was at work: the change of prime minister to Paul Keating, the 1990 s recession, the increasing dominance of neoliberal thinking among Labor ministers and particularly the emergence of the energy and coal lobby, the so-called greenhouse mafia. The change did not come with the election of John Howard, but with the change of Labor leader when Keating defeated Hawke. Ros Kelly staffer, Judy Lambert, has documented that Keating made it clear that environment was not to be a part of any Labor re-election campaign in 1993. On the question of climate change, Keating was called to account very soon after he became prime minister. The huge Rio Earth Summit on environmental sustainability in June 1992 was a widely publicised international event attended not just by an unprecedented number of governments, but by 2400 representatives of non-government organisations and 17, 000 individuals with UN consultative status. The governments produced action on environment and development, biological diversity and forest principles and set the agenda for much of the UN’s work in the following decades. It also saw the ratification of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which later evolved into the Kyoto protocol. One hundred and seventy-two governments participated, and 108 heads of state or heads of government attended, including US president George Bush snr. Keating was notable by his absence. Of lasting impact over the past twenty years has been the rise of the energy and carbon lobby – the self-designated greenhouse mafia, with its interweaving strands of influence affecting both major political parties. Guy Pearse has documented that relationship in forensic detail in his book, High and Dry, and in a recent Quarterly Essay and has suggested that the lobby arose during the early 1990 s. To secure environment movement support at the 1990 election, the Hawke government made the decision to block the development of a gold mine at Coronation Hill in Kakadu, which produced a monumental backlash from the mining industry. The decision has previously been interpreted in the light of its contribution to the end of Hawke’s prime ministership, but I believe it may also have contributed to the formation of the carbon lobby. Guy Pearse has told me he recalls his interviewees making reference to Coronation Hill on a number of occasions. It seems likely that the threat from the two cabinet submissions proposing a reduction in greenhouse emissions, the high public interest in the environment and the Coronation Hill decision were key factors motivating the carbon lobby to organise in the early 1990 s. Twenty years later, we seem to have forgotten the history of how much progress took place in the 1980 s to move Australia towards a carbon-constrained economy. The opportunity lost was significant. Is it too cynical to claim that the events are forgotten because the victors have written the history? Regardless of the reasons why the history has been suppressed, it is time we remembered what happened. Doing so puts the current debate into a different perspective. •Joan Staples is a Visiting Fellow, Faculty of Law, UNSW and was ACF lobbyist in Canberra from 1983 - 87 under the Hawke Government.

[...] —Mike Sweeney, on the {{difficulty}} of hitting Rivera's cutter despite expecting it Rivera's cut fastball was a respected pitch among major league hitters. Jim Thome called it [...] "the single best pitch ever in the game". David Ortiz echoed his sentiment, saying, [...] "His cutter was the single best pitch I've ever seen, but <b>the</b> really <b>amazing</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> how {{he was able to}} do it for so many years. Are there guys now who have stuff as nasty as Mariano? Maybe for one year, two years. But nobody could maintain it like he did." [...] In 2004, ESPN.com ranked his cutter as the best [...] "out pitch" [...] in baseball. Olney described his cut fastball as [...] "the most dominant pitch of a generation". Although switch-hitters usually bat left-handed against right-handed pitchers to better see the ball's release point, switch-hitters occasionally batted right-handed when facing the right-handed Rivera to avoid being jammed on their hands by his cutter. Similarly, some managers, such as Bruce Bochy in the 1998 World Series, sent right-handed batters to pinch hit for left-handers against Rivera, thinking that the cutter would be more difficult for lefties to hit. Opposing hitters occasionally chose to face Rivera with backup or batting practice bats, rather than risk their best bats being broken by his cutter.|$|R

60|$|To me <b>the</b> most <b>amazing</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{spectacle}} of the swifts. It was late for them, {{near the end of}} August; they should now have been far away on their flight to Africa; yet here they were, delaying on that desolate east coast in wind and wet, more than a hundred of them. It was strange to see so many at one spot, and I could only suppose that they had congregated previous to migration at that unsuitable place, and were being kept back by the late breeders, who had not yet been wrought up to the point of abandoning their broods. They haunted a vast ruinous old barn-like building near the front, which was probably old a century before the town was built, and about fifteen to twenty pairs had their nests under the eaves. Over this building they hung all day in a crowd, rising high to come down again at a frantic speed, and at each descent a few birds could be seen to enter the holes, while others rushed out to join the throng, and then all rose and came down again and swept round and round in a furious chase, shrieking as if mad. At all hours they drew me to that spot, and standing there, marvelling at their swaying power and the fury that possessed them, they appeared to me like tormented beings, and were like those doomed wretches in the halls of Eblis whose hearts were in a blaze of unquenchable fire, and who, every one with hands pressed to his breast, went spinning round in an everlasting agonized dance. They were tormented and crazed by the two most powerful instincts of birds pulling in opposite directions--the parental instinct and the passion of migration which called them to the south.|$|R
