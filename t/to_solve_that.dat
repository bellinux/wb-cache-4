From its part, Germany, {{constrained by the}} limitations of the Treaty of Versailles, looked for a way to proceed with development and joint projects gave them such an opportunity. Among other weapons supplied by Germans was a heavy howitzer, designated in the USSR 152-mm howitzer M1931 (NG). Soon the Motovilikha Mechanical Plant (MMZ) was entrusted with the production of NG. However, only eight pieces were completed in 1932–1934, and then the production was stopped. The design proved to be too complicated for the Soviet industry of the early 1930s (the same fate befell some other designs, e.g. the 122-mm howitzer M1934 or 20-mm and 37-mm autocannons) and was considered somewhat heavy (5,445kg in travelling position). But these early failures it gave Soviet developers some valuable experience.|$|E
25|$|The {{next decade}} {{was marked by}} fierce {{competition}} between Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk. Since 2000, Shakhtar Donetsk {{has proved to be}} the real challengers to Kiev's dominance. In 2000 Shakhtar earned their first qualification to the Champions League earning a place in the Group stage. Nonetheless, Dynamo Kyiv is still considered to be the benchmark of excellence in the country and the primary feeder to the Ukrainian national football team. 2002 became the real cornerstone in the miners history when they earned their first national title under the management of the newly appointed Italian specialist, Nevio Scala, who managed to secure the Ukrainian Cup title as well. Since that time the issue of foreign players has become particularly acute and brought a series of court cases.

At school she had a tough time, since some girls bullied her because they envied her voice. <b>To</b> <b>solve</b> <b>that</b> problem, Dimov organized projects outside school.

[...] Drew Pinsky, an addiction medicine specialist felt that the film's central characters, both of whom were raised by a single parent in the film, [...] "start looking for ways <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>that</b> problem because they were never given the opportunity to grow an emotional landscape from a nurturing, available parent.

2500|$|So it was Poincaré (1905) on 5 June 1905, who {{introduced}} the so-called [...] "Poincaré stresses" [...] <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>that</b> problem. Those stresses were interpreted by {{him as an}} external, non-electromagnetic pressure, which stabilize the electrons and also served as an explanation for length contraction. Although he argued that Lorentz succeeded in creating a theory which complies to the postulate of relativity, he showed that Lorentz's equations of electrodynamics were not fully Lorentz covariant. So by pointing out the group characteristics of the transformation Poincaré demonstrated the Lorentz covariance of the Maxwell–Lorentz equations and corrected Lorentz's transformation formulae for charge density and current density. He went on to sketch a model of gravitation (incl. gravitational waves) which might be compatible with the transformations. Poincaré used {{for the first time}} the term [...] "Lorentz transformation", and he gave them a form which is used up to this day.

2500|$|Even with {{artificial}} reefs in place, a tourist's vacation time may coincide with a [...] "flat spell", when no waves are available. Completely artificial Wave pools aim <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>that</b> problem by controlling {{all the elements}} that go into creating perfect surf, however {{there are only a}} handful of wave pools that can simulate good surfing waves, owing primarily to construction and operation costs and potential liability. Most wave pools generate waves that are too small and lack the power necessary to surf. The Seagaia Ocean Dome, located in Miyazaki, Japan, was an example of a surfable wave pool. Able to generate waves with up to 10-foot faces, the specialized pump held water in 20 vertical tanks positioned along the back edge of the pool. This allowed the waves to be directed as they approach the artificial sea floor. Lefts, Rights, and A-frames could be directed from this pump design providing for rippable surf and barrel rides. The Ocean Dome cost about $2nbsp&billion to build and was expensive to maintain. The Ocean Dome was closed in 2007. In England, construction is nearing completion on the Wave, situated near Bristol, which will enable people unable to get to the coast to enjoy the waves in a controlled environment, set in the heart of nature.|$|E

Corgan said: [...] "I thought for sure I would get really strong reviews for our new album , based on all the feedback I was getting. But I'm getting the same reviews I {{got back in the}} day, these kind of middling, muddling reviews that just won't fucking say: 'This is a fucking brilliant album from a brilliant artist,'" [...] and also elaborated that, [...] "It's not a three-star fucking record. Nobody believes it's a three-star record. Nobody! OK, these people obviously did, so maybe I shouldn't be so absolute. But I've been in this business for 25 years and there is nobody in it who believes this is a three-star record. Nobody!" [...] The original plan was for Monuments to an Elegy to be a pop/rock album and then be followed by an experimental [...] "weird, arty" [...] album, Day for Night. However, the {{response to}} Monuments to an Elegy caused him to re-evaluate the Day for Night demos and decided that, [...] "The Smashing Pumpkins shouldn't be an arty band anymore," [...] and elaborated, [...] "Monuments is me solving a problem of how to get The Smashing Pumpkins back into the mainstream. I had <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>that</b> problem before I can solve problem two, which is where Day for Night comes in. That's why I'd thought 'I'll do the thing I should do, then I'll do the thing I want to do.' But now what I want to do is kick people out of the way."
