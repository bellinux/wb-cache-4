25|$|As Independence Avenue SW {{approaches}} the <b>Tidal</b> <b>Basin,</b> the westbound lanes curve north toward 17th Street SW {{to avoid a}} bay in the Basin. The John Paul Jones Memorial stands where 17th Street SW meets Independence Avenue SW. The eastbound lanes cross the <b>Tidal</b> <b>Basin</b> via the Kutz Bridge. Small off-ramps allow westbound traffic to return eastbound, and eastbound traffic to return westbound, essentially ringing the <b>Tidal</b> <b>Basin</b> bay with roadways. East of the <b>Tidal</b> <b>Basin,</b> Maine Avenue SW joins westbound Independence Avenue. An off-ramp allows eastbound Independence Avenue traffic to access Maine Avenue SW, and then an unnamed bridge creates a grade separation between elevated Independence Avenue and entrenched Maine Avenue. Both lanes of Independence Avenue curve gently through this area before moving northward to avoid the Sidney Yates Federal Building (the red brick, Romanesque Revival headquarters of the United States Forest Service). The two lanes merge into a single street with no median at Raoul Wallenberg Place SW (e.g., 14th Street SW) before curving slightly south to straighten into a formal east-west aligned ceremonial avenue.|$|E
30|$|Moreover, only little {{exchange}} between the Dutch and the German {{part of the}} Wadden Sea was found mainly due {{to the influence of}} the Ems estuary acting as a barrier for water {{exchange between}} these two regions. As a consequence, water exchange with the North Sea was found to be more dominant in the German <b>tidal</b> <b>basins</b> compared to those in the Netherlands. These findings can provide substantial aid for the interpretation of measurements of biogeochemical time series. For example, measurements performed during high tide can be alternately influenced by the North Sea or by other <b>tidal</b> <b>basins.</b> If sampled water masses have high Wadden Sea signals they can have high eutrophication levels, although the respective eutrophication processes took place in other <b>tidal</b> <b>basins.</b> Connecting measurements of eutrophication parameters with these simulations can help to further understand the Wadden Sea system as a continuum of interconnected <b>tidal</b> <b>basins</b> and the North Sea, influencing the biogeochemistry in each other.|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of land {{reclamation}} and dike construction over the last millennium, the size of many Wadden Sea <b>tidal</b> <b>basins</b> has been reduced {{by as much as}} 50 %. As a consequence, average energy levels along the shoreline have increased and have prevented the formation of natural mud flats and salt marshes along much of the mainland shore. Sediment distribution patterns in the Wadden Sea show a progressive shoreward fining trend in sediment composition and hence in mean grain size, indicating the existance of a shore-normal energy gradient. At the mainland shore, this gradient is abruptly terminated by the dike, finer sediments than about 88 Âµm lacking appropriate accommodation space for its deposition. As a result, the modern Wadden Sea is largely a sand-dominated depositional system, both in a physical and a biological sense. The reduction in accommodation space for fine-grained sediments has resulted in severe physical and biological disturbances in the remaining backbarrier <b>tidal</b> <b>basins...</b>|$|R

40|$|We model {{branching}} channel {{patterns in}} short <b>tidal</b> <b>basins</b> with two methods. A theoretical stability analysis {{leads to a}} relationship between the number of channels and physical parameters of the tidal system. The analysis reveals that width and spacing of the channels should decrease as the slope of the bottom profile and the Shields parameter increase and as the mean water depth decreases. In general, the channel depth should halve at every bifurcation. These theoretical results agree well with the field data from the Dutch Wadden Sea. A numerical model based on Delft 3 D, a software system of WL/Delft Hydraulics, is used to simulate the time evolution of a channel network in a geometrically simplified basin of similar dimensions as the Wadden Sea basins. The resulting channel network displays a three-times branching behavior, similar to the three- to four-times branching patterns observed in the Wadden Sea. The simulated channel pattern satisfies the relation derived from the theoretical analysis. The results of this pattern analysis provide for additional validation of two-dimensional/three-dimensional process-based morphodynamic models of <b>tidal</b> <b>basins.</b> Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Intertidal {{blue mussel}} beds are {{important}} for the functioning and community composition of coastal ecosystems. Modeling spatial dynamics of intertidal mussel beds is complicated because suitable habitat is spatially heterogeneously distributed and recruitment and loss are hard to predict. To get insight into the main determinants of dispersion, growth and loss of intertidal mussel beds, we analyzed spatial distributions and growth patterns in the German and Dutch Wadden Sea. We considered yearly distributions of adult intertidal mussel beds from 36 connected <b>tidal</b> <b>basins</b> between 1999 and 2010 and for the period 1968 - 1976. We found that in both periods the highest coverage of tidal flats by mussel beds occurs in the sheltered basins in the southern Wadden Sea. We used a stochastic growth model to investigate the effects of density dependence, winter temperature and storminess on changes in mussel bed coverage between 1999 and 2010. In contrast to expectation, we {{found no evidence that}} cold winters consistently induced events of synchronous population growth, nor did we find strong evidence for increased removal of adult mussel beds after stormy winter seasons. However, we did find synchronic growth within groups of proximate <b>tidal</b> <b>basins</b> and that synchrony between distant groups is mainly low or negative. Because the boundaries between synchronic groups are located near river mouths and in areas lacking suitable mussel bed habitat, we suggest that the metapopulation is under the control of larval dispersal conditions. Our study demonstrates the importance of moving from simple habitat suitability models to models that incorporate metapopulation processes to understand spatial dynamics of mussel beds. The spatio-dynamic structure revealed in this paper will be instrumental for that purpose...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the background of}} five palaeogeographical maps between the Marsdiep and the Weser River, and discusses the natural and anthropogenic processes driving the coastal changes during {{the last part of}} the Holocene. Before 2500 BC, during the first half of the Holocene, <b>tidal</b> <b>basins</b> were formed in the lower lying Pleistocene valley system as a result of the Holocene sea-level rise. The <b>tidal</b> <b>basins</b> were filled during the second half of the Holocene and on the deposits from the Pleistocene in the hinterland large coastal peat bogs developed. These peat bogs were vulnerable and sensitive to marine ingressions when the peat surface subsided due to drainage, compaction and erosion. During the Subatlantic (450 BC to present), the different ingression systems in the coastal area between Marsdiep and Weser had their own histories in timing and evolution. The ingressions were naturally caused by lateral migration of coastal barrier and tidal-inlet systems or by changes in the natural drainage system in the hinterland. From the Late Iron Age onwards, humans started to be the major cause of ingressions. By reclaiming and cultivating the seaward margins of coastal peat bogs, these areas subsided significantly and were flooded by high storm surges. When coastal areas were embanked during the historical period, the situation for the lower lying peat lands became more dramatic. When the sea dikes breached, the peat land was flooded, leading to casualties and huge material damages and loss of land. Drowning of the peat lands of the Jade and Dollard in the 14 th and 15 th centuries are examples of such catastrophes...|$|R
