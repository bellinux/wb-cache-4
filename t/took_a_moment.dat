25|$|Next, Mohun Bagan were {{up against}} a fairly {{confident}} Shillong Lajong side who had entered the semi finals upsetting Kolkata giants East Bengal 4–3 on aggregate. The first 30 minutes of the semi final was a closely contested tie. It <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of individual brilliance from Sony Norde in the 40th minute to open the scoring for Bagan. His long range effort rebounded of Lajong goalkeeper Vishal Kaith and Jeje Lalpekhlua grabbed onto the opportunity as he toed {{the ball into the}} net. This goal opened the scoring flood gates for Mohun Bagan. In the final stages of the first half Bikramjit Singh scored a screamer from a Cornell Glen pass to put Mohun Bagan 2–0 ahead. After the restart Jeje Lalpekhlua completed his hat-trick by scoring in the 51st and 56th minute. At the fag end of the match young star Azharuddin Mallick put the final nail in the Lajong coffin to secure a comprehensive 5–0 victory for the Mariners.|$|E
500|$|The Huffington Post Michael Pascua praised Dempsey's character, in {{comparison}} to his performance in [...] "Good Mourning", writing: [...] "Derek was set up as a real character in the second half, not just a one-sided McDreamy. First, Arizona and Derek finally fix the problem with Andy, then the two had some genuine interaction. Derek confronted Alex about his problems with Izzie. He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to talk to Mark about the hospital's situation and ended the episode by confronting a very edgy Bailey. Miraculously, he {{had the time to}} have a lot of sex with Meredith." [...] Pascua also enjoyed Leigh's performance, commenting: [...] "Lexie continued to evolve. I loved the anxiety that Lexie had with Callie. She wasn't really a doctor in any sense in this episode, just a friend to lean on." [...] Though he was impressed with the majority of the episode, Pascua had mixed feelings on the character of Stevens, attributing it to his dislike of Heigl.|$|E
500|$|Gibson {{said she}} <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> before agreeing, {{as she had}} just wrapped up work on Gaga's Monster Ball HBO special {{but she could not}} resist in the end. [...] "It's a phenomenal video: really powerful, really impactful. She's such a strong, {{committed}} artist. Her loyalty to me is something I will be forever grateful for. We're spiritually connected. We need each other ... and 'Judas' is ultimately a representation of our true bond," [...] she added. With The Hollywood Reporter, Gibson explained that within the video they created a new Jerusalem. The shock value in the video was purposefully added, but ultimately the story was about oppression; and about following one's heart and the glory of being free. With NME magazine Gaga revealed that the video involved motorbikes and a death sequence. She also described the portrayal of her character as being [...] "beyond repentance", which evolved from the continuous media accusations towards her that [...] " [...] trashy. or pretentious or this and that. [...] is my way of saying 'I've crossed the line, I won't even try to repent. Nor should I'." [...] Forgiveness and destiny also played a part in the video, and Gaga wanted to portray a Federico Fellini-esque story with apostles being revolutionaries in a modern-day Jerusalem. They are led to Jesus, by Gaga as Magdalene. Although initially reported to be premiered during an episode of the tenth season of American Idol, the music video premiered on May 5, 2011, on E! News at 7 pm.|$|E

The intention seems to be to present us with the notion that there is, perhaps, such a thing as a happy ending just as we head into the season closer.

2500|$|Christopher Bowdish, a Bethlehem Police detective, stated that, {{as medical}} {{personnel}} attended to Joan Porco at her home, he <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{to ask her}} whether she could identify her attacker. Bowdish {{said that when he}} asked Joan if a family member had done it, Joan used her head to indicate [...] "yes". Bowdish has maintained that when he asked her whether it had been her older son Jonathan, a Naval officer stationed in South Carolina during the attack, she shook her head, indicating it was not, but that she nodded her head up and down, indicating [...] "yes", when he asked her whether Christopher was responsible. Joan Porco's alleged identification of her son Christopher may explain why Bethlehem Police pursued her son soon after the incident, rather than conducting a broader investigation of potential suspects. She also answered in similar ways to other separate questions.|$|E
