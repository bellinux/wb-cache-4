5|$|Coyotes usually attack smaller-sized dogs, {{but they}} have been known to attack even large, {{powerful}} breeds such as the Rottweiler in exceptional cases. Dogs larger than coyotes, such as greyhounds, are generally able to drive <b>them</b> <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> have been known to kill coyotes. Smaller breeds are more likely to suffer injury or death.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} for the World Tag Team Championships between La Résistance (Sylvain Grenier and Robért Conway) against Edge and Chris Benoit, the two {{individuals}} who were not chosen to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight championship. There was back and forth action between the two teams, as all the superstars were {{able to participate in}} the match. Edge abandoned Benoit during the match, which forced Benoit to wrestle La Résistance by himself. Benoit fought <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> he was able to get the upper hand over Grenier. The match concluded with Benoit forcing Conway to submit to the Crippler Crossface to win the title for his team.|$|E
5|$|The Australians seized {{their good}} fortune and set their fastest time to date with 11.0seconds (s). Having been beaten twice after leading out, the Australians sat back before {{sweeping}} past the Germans and Americans {{in the final}} lap. Australia were again drawn against South Africa in their quarter-final, who had defeated them easily in the heats. This time they equalled the fastest team in the competition over the final 200m, clocking 10.8s to progress to the final, where they faced the Italy. Giuseppe Ogna and Cesare Pinarello {{appeared to be in}} control {{at the start of the}} final lap. They had moved alongside the Australians with one and a half laps to go, but the Australians surprised them at the start of the final lap. The Italians came back to pull level at the start of the back straight, but the Australians held <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> pulled away to win by a length and a half. The Italians lodged a protest for interference but it was dismissed. The Australians finished in a time of 10.8s and Browne later claimed that he was convinced by the performance that they would win the gold medal.|$|E

5|$|The {{crews of}} the {{schooner}} {{and of the}} two batteries guarding the harbour had seen Emerald but Maitland still made plans to attack Apropos. He soon discovered {{it was not possible}} to place Emerald so as to engage both enemy batteries simultaneously, and instead sent landing parties to silence the guns, which had been firing on his ship since 17:30. The first landing party, led by Lieutenant Bertram and accompanied by two marine lieutenants and two master mates, stormed the outer fort. Maitland then positioned Emerald close to the second battery while a boat under the command of his third lieutenant, Smith, landed about a mile along the shore. This second landing party encountered Spanish soldiers, but drove <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> pursued them inland. By the time Smith's party returned to the beach, Emerald had already silenced the battery. In the darkness, Smith subsequently failed to locate the fort.|$|E
5|$|Yardley’s {{declaration}} left Australia {{to chase}} 404 runs for victory. At the time, {{this would have}} been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting team. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target; the local press wrote <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> predicted that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket that was expected to favour the spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly, scoring only six runs in the first six overs on a surface that offered spin and bounce. It appeared that they were playing carefully at first before deciding whether to try and achieve the target at a later point. Only 44 runs came in the first hour, meaning that 360 runs were still needed in 285 minutes. Evans then missed a leg-side stumping opportunity against Hassett as Bedser beat both openers with extra bounce. Hassett was dismissed by Compton's left-arm unorthodox spin for 17 with the score at 57. The Englishman’s delivery had caught Hassett's leading edge and he dived forward in his follow through to take a one-handed catch just above the ground. Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes. The English spinners created a number of chances against both batsmen, but multiple catches and stumping opportunities were fumbled. Aside from the missed wicket-taking opportunities, the spinners were erratic in line and length and Bradman and Morris plundered many boundaries. Australia went on to complete the world record chase with seven wickets and 15 minutes in hand, ensuring an unassailable 30 series lead.|$|E
25|$|The other {{objective}} {{was the high}} point known as Molo Point: SBS men took the hill without much opposition but they were counterattacked by a German force retreating from the main town. Running up the hill, the Germans soon encountered heavy small arms fire and grenades. A Greek platoon below cut <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> as a result they surrendered.|$|E

25|$|The Panzer Corps now slowed their advance {{considerably}} but had {{put themselves}} in a very vulnerable position.

25|$|With {{the help}} and {{encouragement}} of his brother, Rabbi Shmuel Scheinberg, and his son-in-law, Rabbi Chaim Dov Altusky (Fruma Rochel's husband), Scheinberg opened the Torah Ore yeshiva in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn in 1960. The yeshiva opened with six students and grew steadily, enrolling many local Sephardi {{boys who were}} attracted by Scheinberg's Torah knowledge and warmth. The Scheinbergs treated their students as their own children, raising money to marry <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> even pay their dentist bills.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} evening, 17-year-old {{high school junior}} Ryan Ferguson and another junior Charles Erickson were {{attending}} Halloween parties in the area. Ferguson and Erickson later {{decided to go to}} meet Ferguson's sister at a bar called By George because a bouncer who worked there would let them in despite being underage. When the teens were out of money, Ferguson's sister bought them a few additional drinks, then cut <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> Ferguson and Erickson left the bar.|$|E
25|$|What {{is thought}} to have been the first action in Maine came when a 25-man militia {{gathered}} at Falmouth in 1675 and sailed to an Indian village, thought {{to be a part of}} the Abenaki, with a single sloop and towing shallops. The Indians drove <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> took the shallops from them. Later that month, the tribe crossed the Saco River in the captured shallops and attacked the settlement of Winter Harbor. Little damage was caused, and similar raids were conducted on Wells and Falmouth later that year.|$|E

25|$|Star Wars: Flight of the Falcon is a 3D aerial shooter game.

The story follows the pilots of the space ship Millennium Falcon, smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca. While they struggle to pay off a debt to Jabba the Hutt, soldiers of the Galactic Empire board their ship.

25|$|Florida {{continued}} to struggle against Nebraska's aggressive, blitzing defense. In the third period, on second {{down from the}} Nebraska 25, Cornhuskers quarterback Frazier ran an option play to the right, and decided to keep the ball rather than pitch. He gained 11 yards before being met {{by a group of}} Florida defenders at the 36-yard line, which he then dragged approximately 10 yards before shrugging <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> breaking free, streaking 75 yards down the sideline to give Nebraska a 49–18 lead. Frazier had broken no fewer than seven tackles on the play. The game ended 62 to 24.|$|E

25|$|The company quickly {{brought in}} strikebreakers and {{restarted}} production {{under the protection}} of the militia. Despite the presence of AFL pickets in front of several recruitment offices across the nation, Frick easily found employees to work the mill. The company quickly built bunk houses, dining halls and kitchens on the mill grounds to accommodate the strikebreakers. New employees, many of them black, arrived on July 13, and the mill furnaces relit on July 15. When a few workers attempted to storm into the plant to stop the relighting of the furnaces, militiamen fought <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> wounded six with bayonets. But all was not well inside the plant. A race war between nonunion black and white workers in the Homestead plant broke out on July 22, 1892.|$|E
25|$|The caliph al-Mutawakkil (847-861) {{had created}} a plan of {{succession}} that would allow his sons to inherit the caliphate after his death; he would be succeeded first by his eldest son, al-Muntasir, then by al-Mu'tazz and third by al-Mu'ayyad. In 861 al-Mutawakkil was assassinated {{by a group of}} Turkish military officers, likely with the support of al-Muntasir. During al-Muntasir's short reign (861-862), the Turks pressured him into removing al-Mu'tazz and al-Mu'ayyad from the succession. When al-Muntasir died, the Turkish officers gathered together and decided to install the dead caliph's cousin al-Musta'in on the throne. The new caliph was almost immediately faced with a large riot in Samarra in support of the disenfranchised al-Mu'tazz; the rioters were put down by the military but casualties on both sides were heavy. Al-Musta'in, worried that al-Mu'tazz or al-Mua'yyad could press their claims to the caliphate, first attempted to buy <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> then threw them in prison.|$|E
