25|$|According to this theory, coolness is a subjective, dynamic, socially-constructed trait, {{such that}} coolness is in <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beholder.</b> People {{perceive}} things (e.g., other people, products or brands) {{to be cool}} based on an inference of “autonomy”. That is, something {{is perceived to be}} cool when it follows its own motivations. However, this theory proposes that the level of autonomy that leads to coolness is constrained - inappropriate levels of autonomy, such that the autonomy is too high or opposes a legitimate norm, do not lead to perceptions of coolness. The level of autonomy considered appropriate is influenced by individual difference variables. For example, people who think of societal institutions and authority as unjust or repressive perceive coolness at higher levels of autonomy than those who are less critical of social norms and authority.|$|E

2500|$|Common wisdom {{tells us}} that beauty is in <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beholder.</b> [...] Sircello’s {{philosophy}} runs counter to this maxim. [...] He maintained that beauty is objective in a very particular way. [...] His starting point is the recognition that when a judgment of beauty is made {{there is something about}} the object that is thought to be beautiful. [...] For example, if an alpine sunset seen as beautiful, {{this is due to the}} quality of light expressed in the sunset, or perhaps because of the intense depth of the vista, or because of some other attribute of the scene that stands out as exceptional in some way. [...] Beauty resides for Sircello in the possession by objects, scenes, actions, and so on of qualities to a very high degree. [...] Qualities of lack, deficiency or defect are excluded from this because these qualities are not enjoyed qualities.|$|E

2500|$|Accordingly, in July 1806, Nott and the {{trustees}} determined {{to acquire a}} large tract of land {{to the east of}} the Downtown Schenectady, on a gentle slope up from the Mohawk River and facing nearly due west. This tract was not promisingly described by Nott some years later as “pasture grounds, scarred by deep ravines, rendered at once unsightly and difficult of access by an alternation of swamp and sand hill …”. [...] Clearly, the prospect was largely in <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beholder.</b> There was apparently even a sulphur spring on the hill, although it did not pose any threat to Saratoga Springs.

Then a meeting occurred that changed not only the Union College campus, but many other American college designs for the next several decades. [...] The catalyst for this venture was international financier David Parish.|$|E

It was demolished long before I left Cambridge, but in memory it still stands on the ground since occupied by the Hemenway Gymnasium, and shows for me through that bulk a phantom frame of Continental buff in the shadow of elms that are shadows themselves. The 'genius loci' was limping about the pleasant mansion with the rheumatism which then expressed itself to his friends in a resolute smile, but which now insists upon being an essential trait of the full-length presence to my mind: a short stout figure, helped out with a cane, and a grizzled head with features formed to win the heart rather than <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beholder.</b>|$|E
60|$|We {{are full}} of these superstitions of sense, the worship of magnitude. We call the poet inactive, {{because he is not}} a president, a merchant, or a porter. We adore an institution, and do not see that it is founded on a thought which we have. But real action is in silent moments. The epochs of our life are not in the visible facts of our choice of a calling, our marriage, our {{acquisition}} of an office, and the like, but in a silent thought by the way-side as we walk; in a thought which revises our entire manner of life and says,--'Thus hast thou done, but it were better thus.' And all our after years, like menials, serve and wait on this, and according to their ability execute its will. This revisal or correction is a constant force, which, as a tendency, reaches through our lifetime. The object of the man, the aim of these moments, is to make daylight shine through him, to suffer the law to traverse his whole being without obstruction, so that on what point soever of his doing your eye falls it shall report truly of his character, whether it be his diet, his house, his religious forms, his society, his mirth, his vote, his opposition. Now he is not homogeneous, but heterogeneous, and the ray does not traverse; there are no thorough lights, but <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beholder</b> is puzzled, detecting many unlike tendencies and a life not yet at one.|$|E
60|$|But it is {{fit that}} the Past should be dark; though the {{darkness}} {{is not so}} much a quality of the past as of tradition. It is not a distance of time, but a distance of relation, which makes thus dusky its memorials. What is near to the heart of this generation is fair and bright still. Greece lies outspread fair and sunshiny in floods of light, for there is the sun and daylight in her literature and art. Homer does not allow us to forget that the sun shone,--nor Phidias, nor the Parthenon. Yet no era has been wholly dark, nor will we too hastily submit to the historian, and congratulate ourselves on a blaze of light. If we could pierce the obscurity of those remote years, we should find it light enough; only there is not our day. Some creatures are made to see in the dark. There has always been the same amount of light in the world. The new and missing stars, the comets and eclipses, do not affect the general illumination, for only our glasses appreciate them. The eyes of the oldest fossil remains, they tell us, indicate that the same laws of light prevailed then as now. Always the laws of light are the same, but the modes and degrees of seeing vary. The gods are partial to no era, but steadily shines their light in the heavens, while <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beholder</b> is turned to stone. There was but the sun and the eye from the first. The ages have not added a new ray to the one, nor altered a fibre of the other.|$|E

60|$|She {{sprang up}} and walked gladly by his side, {{chattering}} away as they stood on a slight eminence overlooking the first tee, using all the simple and justifiable weapons in her little armoury of charms to win {{a smile and a}} little notice, perhaps even a later thought from the great man of the day whose wealth alone made him seem almost like a hero of romance. She was a pleasant-faced girl, with clear brown eyes and masses of hair brushed back from her forehead and left unhandicapped by any headgear to dazzle <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beholder.</b> Her blouse was cut a little low, but the writer of the young ladies' journal, who had sent her the pattern, had assured her that it was no lower than fashion permitted. Her white skirt was a little short, and her stockings were very nearly silk. She was twenty-two years old, fairly modest, moderately truthful, respectably brought up, but she was the eldest of four, and she would have fallen at Jacob's feet and kissed the ground beneath them for a sign of his favour. Jacob, with the echoes of that tragic story still in his ears, wondered, as he stood with his hands behind his back, whether in those few minutes, when he had taken his meed of revenge, he had indeed raised up a ghost which was to follow him through life. More than anything in the world, what he wanted besides the good-fellowship of other men was the love and companionship of a wife. Was his to be the dream of Tantalus? Here, young womanhood of his own class, eager, sufficiently comely, stood striving to weave the spell of her sex upon him, with a lack of success which was almost pitiable. It was the selective instinct with which he was cursed. Something had even gone from the sad pleasure with which he {{used to be able to}} conjure up pictures of Sybil. It was almost as though the thought of her had ceased to attract him, and with the passing of the spell which she had laid upon him had come a passion as strong as ever for her sex, coupled with hopeless and glacial indifference to its human interpretesses. The girl began to feel the strain of a monosyllabic listener, but she had the courage of a heroine. She clutched her companion's arm as her father topped his drive from the first tee. As though by accident, her fingers remained on Jacob's coat sleeve.|$|E
