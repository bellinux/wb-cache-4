5|$|Galileo Galilei was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to view the Pleiades <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescope.</b> He thereby discovered that the cluster contains many stars too dim {{to be seen with}} the naked eye. He published his observations, including a sketch of the Pleiades showing 36 stars, in his treatise Sidereus Nuncius in March 1610.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} magnitude of Ariel is 14.8; {{similar to that}} of Pluto near perihelion. However, while Pluto can be seen <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescope</b> of 30cm aperture, Ariel, due to its proximity to Uranus's glare, is often not visible to telescopes of 40cm aperture.|$|E
5|$|NGC 362 {{is another}} {{globular}} cluster in Tucana with an apparent magnitude of 6.4, 27,700 light-years from Earth. Like neighboring 47 Tucanae, NGC 362 is a Shapley class III cluster {{and among the}} brightest globular clusters in the sky. Unusually for a globular cluster, its orbit takes it {{very close to the}} center of the Milky Way—approximately 3,000 light-years. It was discovered in the 1820s by James Dunlop. Its stars become visible at 180x magnification <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescope.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{innermost}} ring of Neptune {{is called}} the Galle ring after Johann Gottfried Galle, {{the first person to}} see Neptune <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescope</b> (1846). It is about 2,000km wide and orbits 41,000–43,000km from the planet. It is a faint ring with an average normal optical depth of around 10−4, and with an equivalent depth of 0.15km. The fraction of dust in this ring is estimated from 40% to 70%.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{was able}} to develop a method of {{determining}} longitude based on {{the timing of the}} orbits of the Galilean moons. The times of the eclipses of the moons could be precisely calculated in advance, and compared with local observations on land or on ship to determine the local time and hence longitude. The main problem with the technique was that it was difficult to observe the Galilean moons <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescope</b> on a moving ship; a problem that Galileo tried to solve with the invention of the celatone. The method was used by Cassini and Picard to re-map France.|$|E
5|$|Lynx is rich {{in double}} stars. The second {{brightest}} star in the constellation is 38 Lyncis at magnitude 3.8. When viewed through a moderate telescope, the two components—a brighter blue-white star of magnitude 3.9 and a fainter star of magnitude 6.1 that {{has been described as}} lilac as well as blue-white—can be seen. 15 Lyncis is another star that is found to be a double system when viewed <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescope,</b> separating into two yellowish stars of magnitudes 4.7 and 5.8 that are 0.9arcseconds apart. The components are a yellow giant of spectral type G8III that is around 4.01 times as massive as the Sun, and a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F8V that is around 3.73 times as massive as the Sun. Orbiting each other every 262 years, the stars are 178 ± 2 light years distant from Earth. 12 Lyncis has a combined apparent magnitude of 4.87. When seen <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescope,</b> it can be separated into three stars: two components with magnitudes 5.4 and 6.0 that lie at an angular separation by 1.8″ (as of 1992) and a yellow-hued star of magnitude 7.2 at a separation of 8.6″ (as of 1990). The two brighter stars are estimated to orbit each other with a period that is poorly known but estimated to be roughly 700 to 900 years. The 12 Lyncis system is 210 ± 10 light years distant from Earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{staff at}} Cherry Springs State Park {{did not intend}} for it to become an {{attraction}} for amateur astronomers; the astronomers came to them instead. In 1997or 1998Chip Harrison, the park supervisor, noticed a man looking <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescope</b> at the park at about 1AM. When Harrison asked why the man had come there, the astronomer said he had noticed an isolated black patch over north central Pennsylvania on nighttime satellite photos. Cherry Springs State Park is in that patch, {{one of the best}} locations east of the Mississippi River for stargazing.|$|E
5|$|At {{its closest}} approach, the angular size of Mars is 25arcseconds (a unit of degree); {{this is much}} {{too small for the}} naked eye to resolve. Hence, prior to the {{invention}} of the telescope, nothing was known about the planet besides its position on the sky. The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first person known to use a telescope to make astronomical observations. His records indicate that he began observing Mars <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescope</b> in September 1610. This instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on the planet, so he set the goal of seeing if Mars exhibited phases of partial darkness similar to Venus or the Moon. Although uncertain of his success, by December he did note that Mars had shrunk in angular size. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius succeeded in observing a phase of Mars in 1645.|$|E
5|$|Leicester House was {{intermittently}} inhabited {{during the}} mid-18th century, and was finally {{sold to the}} naturalist Ashton Lever in 1775. Lever turned the house into a museum with {{a significant amount of}} natural history objects. In turn, the square began to serve as a venue for popular entertainments. Brothels started appearing around Leicester Square during the century, and visitors could pay to watch the severed heads of traitors executed at Temple Bar <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescope.</b> Leicester House became home of a museum of natural curiosities called the Holophusikon in the 1780s. It was demolished in 1791–72 due to rising debts following the extinction of the Leicester peerage, and replaced by Leicester Place. That in turn was converted into a church in 1865 and is now the site of the Prince Charles Cinema.|$|E

5|$|The 55 Cancri {{system is}} located fairly {{close to the}} Solar System: the Hipparcos {{astrometry}} satellite measured the parallax of 55 Cancri A as 81.03 milliarcseconds, corresponding to a distance of 12.3 parsecs (40.3 light years). 55 Cancri A has an apparent magnitude of 5.95, making it just {{visible to the naked}} eye under very dark skies. The red dwarf 55 Cancri B is of the 13th magnitude and only visible <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescope.</b> The two components are separated by an estimated distance of 1065 AU (one thousand times the distance from the Earth to the Sun). Despite their wide separation, the two stars appear to be gravitationally bound, as they share a common proper motion.|$|E

25|$|The {{scientific}} fascinations of {{the novel}} are established in the opening chapter where the narrator views Mars <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescope,</b> and Wells offers {{the image of the}} superior Martians having observed human affairs, as though watching tiny organisms through a microscope. Ironically it is microscopic Earth lifeforms that finally prove deadly to the Martian invasion force. In 1894 a French astronomer observed a 'strange light' on Mars, and published his findings in the scientific journal Nature on 2 August of that year. Wells used this observation to open the novel, imagining these lights to be the launching of the Martian cylinders toward Earth. American astronomer Percival Lowell published the book Mars in 1895 suggesting features of the planet's surface observed through telescopes might be canals. He speculated that these might be irrigation channels constructed by a sentient life form to support existence on an arid, dying world, similar to that which Wells suggests the Martians have left behind. The novel also presents ideas related to Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, both in specific ideas discussed by the narrator, and themes explored by the story.|$|E
