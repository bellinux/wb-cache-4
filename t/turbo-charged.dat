Renault had also taken over the Gordini tuning firm and merged the two to form Renault Sport. A number of increasingly successful sports racing cars appeared, culminating in the 1978 Le Mans win with the Renault Alpine A442B. This was fitted with a <b>turbo-charged</b> engine; Alpine {{had been the first}} company to run in and win an international rally with a turbo car as far back as 1972 when Thérier took a specially modified A110 to victory on the Critérium des Cévennes.|$|E

25|$|Rial {{expanded}} to two cars {{ahead of the}} 1989 season, and with de Cesaris moving to Dallara, German drivers Christian Danner and Volker Weidler were hired to drive the ARC2. Designed by new engineer Stefan Fober, the car was {{an updated version of}} the ARC1, with reworked aerodynamics by McLaren designer Bob Bell, and the improved Cosworth DFR engine being worked into the chassis. With <b>turbo-charged</b> engines banned for 1989, the entry list had increased to 39 cars from 20 teams; to accommodate the number of cars a pre-qualifying system was introduced, where the new cars and the teams ranked lowest in the previous season would compete for the 30 spaces available in qualifying, and then for the 26 starters in the race. Danner did not have to pre-qualify, while Weidler driving the new entry had to enter the session.|$|E
25|$|De Angelis {{was then}} {{promoted}} back to outright number {{one for the}} 1983 season. This was demonstrated {{by the fact that}} he had exclusive use of the quick but unreliable Renault <b>turbo-charged</b> 93T for the whole season, and Mansell did not get to drive a turbocharged car until the ninth round, the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, a race where he climbed from 16th to second and eventually finished fourth in a brand-new, hastily designed 94T. Due to their tumultuous relationship and a lack of decent results, Warr was not keen on honouring the last year of the contract that Mansell had signed with Chapman. However, with encouragement from Lotus's sponsors, John Player Special (who allegedly preferred a British driver), and with the only other top British driver (Derek Warwick) already confirmed to be joining the factory Renault team, it was announced Mansell would be staying with the team.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Reduced {{pollution}} {{of the natural}} environment with toxic compounds emitted by motor-vehicle en-gines is at present {{one of the most}} serious ecological issues. Not only the engine properties will decide on meet-ing these requirements but also the expected conditions of its operation that should be taken into consideration in the constructional and adjustment works. Attention was paid in this paper to the aspects of application of the optimisation procedure in the fi eld of combustion engines. One of the possibilities of controlling the fuel consumption and concentration of toxic components in the exhaust gases was presented through optimum – as far as the set conditions are concerned – selection of constructional parameters of the <b>turbo-charging</b> system and methods of its adjustment. The results of the measurements of fuel consumption and the smoke opacity of the exhaust gases of the engine with compression-ignition of the SW- 680 type with the sequential <b>turbo-charging</b> system were used in the calculations. An optimum confi guration of the <b>turbo-charging</b> unit reduction of fuel consumption was obtained with keeping the smoke opacity of exhaust gases at the permissible level, which can be considered as a very promising result.

500|$|The Return of the King {{continued}} the series' critical success, with Rotten Tomatoes reporting that 95 {{percent of the}} critics were positive. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times believed the film {{to be the best}} of the three, as it [...] "certifies the Ring trilogy as a work of bold ambition at a time of cinematic timidity." [...] Entertainment Weekly film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum was equally praiseworthy of the final chapter. She explained, [...] "I can't think of another film trilogy that ends in such glory, or another monumental work of sustained storytelling that surges ahead with so much inventiveness and ardor. The conclusion of Peter Jackson's masterwork is passionate and literate, detailed and expansive, and it's conceived with a risk-taking flair for old-fashioned movie magic at its most precious, a rarity now that CGI prowess has fallen into the hands of run-of-the-mill studio ring-chasers." [...] The Guardians Peter Bradshaw wrote, [...] "With enormous energy and a passionately exacting eye for detail, Jackson has made the regressive-romantic legend live again. He has given the Tolkien myth a <b>turbo-charged</b> rush into the 21st century." ...|$|E

Then she sings, [...] "I wanna love you/ But something's pulling me away from you/ Jesus is my virtue, Judas is the demon I cling to, I cling to." [...] In this section, Gaga's vocals drew comparison to that of Rihanna's by Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone. He also added that her voice sounded less dark and dramatic and was full of [...] "bubbly sweetness". Popjustice wrote that the breakdown sounded like tribal-techno, and the whole song was [...] "a <b>turbo-charged</b> electrogothic wrongness anthem". Dan Martin from NME wrote that the breakdown was in the dubstep genre with the chorus being [...] "pure-pop". There were some similarities and influences of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] in the song, which Gaga said was deliberate. She explained that while sometimes it is important for her to push herself in new directions, she did want her characteristic sound to be imbibed in her records. [...] "I wanted [...] to be an evolution from where I’ve been before {{but in terms of the}} formula I wanted there to be something about 'Judas' that reminded people of what I’ve done in the past," [...] she added. According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the time signature of common time, and is composed in the key of C minor with a tempo of 131 beats per minute. Gaga's voice ranges from the tonal nodes of B3 to E5 and the song follows a basic sequence of A–Fm7–Cm–B–Cm as its chord progression.|$|E

[...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Fueled with plenty of humor, action, heartfelt drama, and amazing new technical feats, Cars is a high octane delight for moviegoers of all ages." [...] Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Existing both in <b>turbo-charged</b> today and the gentler '50s, straddling the realms of Pixar styling and old Disney heart, this new-model Cars is an instant classic." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "Despite representing another impressive technical achievement, it's the least visually interesting of the computer-animation boutique's movies, and -- in an ironic twist for a story about auto racing -- drifts slowly through its semi-arid midsection." [...] Robert Wilonsky of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "What ultimately redeems Cars from turning out a total lemon is its soul. Lasseter loves these animated inanimate objects as though they were kin, and it shows in every beautifully rendered frame." [...] Ella Taylor of L.A.

50|$|In 1951 MAN {{presented}} a turbocharged version of their MK26 truck, {{although it was}} never put into mass production. Series production of turbocharged diesel trucks commenced in 1954, when both MAN 750TL1 and Volvo Titan Turbo {{were introduced to the}} markets. The building of the Interstate Highway System in the USA from 1956 made long-distance road transportation of goods more attractive. To keep up with general traffic, more powerful engines came in increasing demand. Cummins, Detroit, and CAT all had <b>turbo-charging</b> as an option by the late-1960s. In Europe, legislation was introduced in Germany mandating a minimum power-to-weight ratio for trucks; by the late 1960s, a 38-tonne consist had to have at least 304 hp. Most manufacturers met these requirement with large-displacement natural aspiration engines, some with the option of large-displacement or <b>turbo-charging,</b> while Scania and Volvo where among those that only provided turbocharged trucks that met the demands. <b>Turbo-charging</b> was not preferred initially as the engines were perceived to be less reliable, however the method won a decisive victory by the mid-1970s as the 1973 oil crisis increased fuel costs. The last market to see the absolute penetration of turbo diesels was Japan, where legislation on particle emissions effectively mandated natural aspiration engines until effective particle filters became available.|$|R
