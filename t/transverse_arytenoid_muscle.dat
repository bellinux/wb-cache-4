40|$|The aims were {{to assess}} the {{technical}} feasibility of using a single electrode in the posterior <b>arytenoid</b> <b>muscles</b> (PAM) for intraoperative monitoring of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) in thyroid surgery, to validate the new method against the insertion of electrodes placed in the vocal cord muscle, and to report {{the results of the}} clinical application of the new concept. A total of 52 patients were enrolled. The handling and safety of RLN monitoring was tested by simultaneous registration of the EMG response from vocal fold electrodes and PAM electrodes. Acoustically and electromyographically we found nearly the same values for the <b>arytenoid</b> <b>muscles</b> as for the vocal folds, although the signals taken from the vocal folds were slightly stronger. PAM recording using a single bipolar electrode is technically feasible and as reliable compared to the standard vocal cord monitoring...|$|R
50|$|The oblique arytenoid, {{the more}} {{superficial}} <b>Arytenoid</b> <b>muscle,</b> forms two fasciculi, which pass {{from the base}} of one cartilage to the apex of the opposite one, and therefore cross each other like the limbs of the letter X; a few fibers are continued around the lateral margin of the cartilage, and are prolonged into the aryepiglottic fold; they are sometimes described as a separate muscle, the Aryepiglotticus.|$|R
50|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{muscles are}} divided into respiratory and the phonatory muscles (the muscles of phonation). The respiratory muscles move the vocal cords apart and serve breathing. The phonatory muscles move the vocal cords together and serve the production of voice. The extrinsic, passing between the larynx and parts around; and intrinsic, confined entirely. The main respiratory muscles are the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles. The phonatory muscles {{are divided into}} adductors (lateral cricoarytenoid <b>muscles,</b> <b>arytenoid</b> <b>muscles)</b> and tensors (cricothyroid muscles, thyroarytenoid muscles).|$|R
40|$|Laryngeal {{muscles in}} mammals are {{involved}} in highly specialized functions such as control of air passage, sphincter for airway protection and phonation. In this study, we aimed to assess whether such specialized functions are accompanied by specific distributions of fibre types. To this end, we studied {{the expression of the}} isoforms of the heavy subunit of myosin, myosin heavy chain (MyHC), which are considered the molecular markers of fibre types. The pattern of MyHC isoform expression was determined in 5 intrinsic laryngeal muscles: tensors as thyroarytenoid (TA), vocal (Vo), cricothyroid (CT), adductors as <b>transverse</b> <b>arytenoid</b> or interaytenoid (IA), and abductors as posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA), and 2 extrinsic muscles such as thyropharingeal (TPh) and cricopharingeal (CrPh). Muscles were sampled in 14 patients (11 males and 3 females, age 55 - 75 years) subjected to laryngectomy. MyHC isoforms were separated by SDS-PAGE and quantified by computer assisted densitometry. The comparison between the proportions of MyHC isoforms showed that: i) the three isoforms expressed in trunk and limb muscles (I, IIA and IIX) were present in all muscles examined, ii) the fast or type II MyHC isoforms were predominant in all muscles, representing 60 - 70 % of the total, with no significant differences with respect to muscle types, iii) an additional isoform (indicated as MyHC L) was present in the muscles {{of the majority of the}} subjects and was more abundant in Vo and IA. MyHC L was, however, not found in any muscle of the three female patients and was never found in TA and TPh, iv) a great interindividual variability in MyHC distribution was present in all muscles...|$|R
50|$|It is true {{vocal fold}} closure {{that is the}} primary laryngopharyngeal {{protective}} mechanism to prevent aspiration during swallowing. The adduction of the vocal cords is effected by the contraction of the lateral cricoarytenoids and the oblique and <b>transverse</b> <b>arytenoids</b> (all recurrent laryngeal nerve of vagus). Since the true vocal folds adduct during the swallow, a finite period of apnea (swallowing apnea) must necessarily take place with each swallow. When relating swallowing to respiration, it has been demonstrated that swallowing occurs most often during expiration, even at full expiration a fine air jet is expired probably to clear the upper larynx from food remnants or liquid. The clinical significance of this finding is that patients with a baseline of compromised lung function will, {{over a period of}} time, develop respiratory distress as a meal progresses.Subsequently, false vocal fold adduction, adduction of the aryepiglottic folds and retroversion of the epiglottis take place. The aryepiglotticus (recurrent laryngeal nerve of vagus) contracts, causing the arytenoids to appose each other (closes the laryngeal aditus by bringing the aryepiglottic folds together), and draws the epiglottis down to bring its lower half into contact with arytenoids, thus closing the aditus. Retroversion of the epiglottis, while not the primary mechanism of protecting the airway from laryngeal penetration and aspiration, acts to anatomically direct the food bolus laterally towards the piriform fossa.Additionally, the larynx is pulled up with the pharynx under the tongue by stylopharyngeus (IX), salpingopharyngeus (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X), palatopharyngeus (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X) and inferior constrictor (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X).This phase is passively controlled reflexively and involves cranial nerves V, X (vagus), XI (accessory) and XII (hypoglossal). The respiratory center of the medulla is directly inhibited by the swallowing center for the very brief time that it takes to swallow. This means that it is briefly impossible to breathe during this phase of swallowing and the moment where breathing is prevented is known as deglutition apnea.|$|R
5|$|It {{is largely}} unknown how baleen whales produce sound {{because of the}} lack of a melon and vocal cords. In a 2007 study, it was {{discovered}} that the larynx had U-shaped folds which are thought to be similar to vocal cords. They are positioned parallel to air flow, as opposed to the perpendicular vocal cords of terrestrial mammals. These may control air flow and cause vibrations. The walls of the larynx are able to contract which may generate sound with support from the <b>arytenoid</b> cartilages. The <b>muscles</b> surrounding the larynx may expel air rapidly or maintain a constant volume while diving.|$|R
40|$|PurposeWe {{have been}} {{developing}} an image-guided single vocal cord irradiation technique to treat patients with stage T 1 a glottic carcinoma. In the present study, {{we compared the}} dose coverage to the affected vocal cord and the dose delivered to the organs at risk using conventional, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) coplanar, and IMRT non-coplanar techniques. Methods and MaterialsFor 10 patients, conventional treatment plans using two laterally opposed wedged 6 -MV photon beams were calculated in XiO (Elekta-CMS treatment planning system). An in-house IMRT/beam angle optimization algorithm was used to obtain the coplanar and non-coplanar optimized beam angles. Using these angles, the IMRT plans were generated in Monaco (IMRT treatment planning system, Elekta-CMS) with the implemented Monte Carlo dose calculation algorithm. The organs at risk included the contralateral vocal cord, <b>arytenoids,</b> swallowing <b>muscles,</b> carotid arteries, and spinal cord. The prescription dose was 66 Gy in 33 fractions. ResultsFor the conventional plans and coplanar and non-coplanar IMRT plans, the population-averaged mean dose ± standard deviation to the planning target volume was 67 ± 1 Gy. The contralateral vocal cord dose was reduced from 66 ± 1 Gy in the conventional plans to 39 ± 8 Gy and 36 ± 6 Gy in the coplanar and non-coplanar IMRT plans, respectively. IMRT consistently reduced the doses to the other organs at risk. ConclusionsSingle vocal cord irradiation with IMRT resulted in good target coverage and provided significant sparing of the critical structures. This {{has the potential to}} improve the quality-of-life outcomes after RT and maintain the same local control rates...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the age of onset, incidence and severity of neurogenic disease in the intrinsic laryngeal muscles of a single breed of competitive horse, the New Zealand Thoroughbred. Some palatal muscles from these horses were also studied to ascertain whether neurogenic disease occurred in them. The left and right dorsal cricoarytenoid, lateral cricoarytenoid, <b>transverse</b> <b>arytenoid,</b> ventricular, vocal, cricothyroid, hyoepiglottic, palatopharyngeal, palatine levator, palatine, and palatine tensor muscles were collected from some or all of 53 Thoroughbred horses. Forty-six of the horses had no history of upper respiratory tract abnormalities, six had suffered from idiopathic laryngeal hemiplegia and one from laryngo-palatal dislocation. For comparative purposes similar muscles from three ponies were also studied. The muscles were weighed and then frozen sections were prepared from them. Some of these were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and others to demonstrate the activity of myosin adenosine triphosphatase, succinate dehydrogenase and glycogen phosphorylase. These sections were then studied to determine the muscle fibre types present and their proportions. The mean sizes of the groups of myosin adenosine triphosphatase low reacting fibres were measured as were the mean cross sectional areas of the fibres. Abnormal staining characteristics of the fibres were noted along with histological signs of denervation and reinnervation. Where possible this information was analysed to determine the significance of the differences observed between the measured mean values. A difference in weight between some of the left and right laryngeal muscles was found to be very common in Thoroughbred horses with no history of upper respiratory tract abnormalities. The left lateral cricoarytenoid muscle was lighter than the right in approximately half of these horses. This difference was significant between the muscles of these horses over three years of age and was most obvious in the muscles of the geldings. The left and right dorsal crico-arytenoid muscles showed similar but not such marked differences. These differences were more obvious in the laryngeal hemiplegic horses. The fibres of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles were predominantly highly reactive for the enzyme myosin adenosine triphosphatase with the ventricular and vocal muscles having the highest proportions of these fibres and the cricothyroid and hyoepiglottic muscles the lowest. Glycogen phosphorylase reactivity in these muscles was again predominantly high, and the fibres were almost exclusively, highly reactive for succinate dehydrogenase. Neurogenic disease appeared to have an influence on the proportions of fibre types present in affected muscles. The incidence of larger groups of myosin adenosine triphosphatase low reacting fibres in some of the left than right intrinsic laryngeal muscles was also very common in Thoroughbred horses with no history of upper respiratory tract abnormalities. Eighty percent of these horses over three years of age had larger groups in their left than right lateral cricoarytenoid muscles and the youngest horse where this difference was noted was six weeks Old. The adductor muscles showed more evidence of this side difference in group size than the abductor muscles. The mean cross sectional area of the fibres of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles studied increased till approximately the end of the third year of a horse's life. Neurogenic disease eventually reduced the cross sectional area of the fibres of affected muscles but early in its course it may have produced an increase in the mean cross sectional area of fibres. This increase occurred in mildly affected and also in some unaffected muscles. The latter may have been required to increase their activity to compensate for inefficient function in atrophied muscles. The histological signs of denervation and reinnervation were also very common in the intrinsic laryngeal muscles supplied by the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. These signs were noted in almost 70 % of the left lateral cricoarytenoid muscles from horses over one year of age, with no history of upper respiratory tract abnormalities. The incidence of these signs in the dorsal cricoarytenoid muscle was lower but they appeared suddenly and severely in the left muscles of horses during adolescence and early adult life. In the cricothyroid muscle which is not supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve, the only histological signs of this nature appeared in the muscles of a few of the aged horses. In the palatal muscles examined there was no evidence of a difference in weight between the left and right muscles and most of their fibres were highly reactive for the three enzymes studied. There was no evidence of fibre type grouping resulting from denervation and reinnervation and none of the other histological signs resulting from severe neurogenic disease were noted...|$|R
