A recent paper suggests, for a special case of our model, that there always exists a unique pair of coordinating transshipment prices. We demonstrate through a counterexample that this statement is not correct and derive sufficient and necessary conditions under which it would hold. We show that in some conditions, coordinating prices may exist for only a narrow range of problem parameters and explore conditions when this can happen.

The Broad Gauge was technically superior but conversion of the standard gauge routes to broad would have meant reconstructing every tunnel, bridge and station platform, whereas universal adoption of the standard gauge only required the progressive conversion of the track itself.

40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONThe Social Life of Logistics on the Moroccan Mediterranean CoastbyJanell RothenbergDoctor of Philosophy in AnthropologyUniversity of California, Los Angeles, 2015 Professor Suzanne Slyomovics, ChairIf Morocco is the {{historic}} crossroads between Africa and Europe, then Tangier is the informal capital of crossing. To be urban denizens {{of this city}} includes the everyday experience of seeing Spain and Gibraltar on the horizon, and of navigating between the winds that blow from the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. This dissertation follows the Tangier Med Port, a new infrastructure opened in 2007 at this intersection between lands and seas in order to transform Morocco into a major actor in the global logistics of trade. Merely nine miles from Europe, this port was built {{at one of the}} busiest bottlenecks in world shipping to serve as a platform for global commodity circulation. To be Moroccan actors in the industries of this emerging global hub includes the shared experience of seeing this bottleneck translated into the materials of work. While mega-ports are planned as infrastructures of commodity circulation, port actors translate plans into the everyday logistics of circulating commodities. In the five chapters of this dissertation, I analyze both the aspirations of this global logistics hub as well as the everyday logistics of commodity circulation in the port region. In chapter one, I examine the global, national, and regional context of the Tangier Med Port through an analysis sensitive to the past, present and future. I show how the perspectives of Tangier inhabitants and port administrators reveal contrasting versions of global regionalism. In chapter two, I follow the regional social worlds of trailers and containers in order to illustrate how these objects of physical movement connect the Tangier Med Port to a larger region of socio-technical practice. In chapter three, I examine how the aspirational discourses at the port authority exclude concerns deemed too “Moroccan” in order to qualify the Tangier Med Port as a uniquely modern infrastructure. These discourses position the port as the ideal platform for transcending the perceived temporal incongruity between Morocco and the Global North. In chapter four, I propose the concept of “practical connectivity” to replace traditional metaphors of friction or flow for understanding how emerging port connections are mediated in particular projects of global logistics. In the final chapter, I contrast the shifting visibilities of labor and infrastructure during and after a major work stoppage at the port’s container terminals in 2011. Stoppages reveal how these terminals, designed primarily for moving <b>transshipped</b> <b>goods</b> between vessels, are reframed by dockworkers into innovative platforms of global solidarity. My ethnographic study of the Tangier Med Port and its actors reveals multiple, planned and unplanned ways through which commodity movement is assembled in a particular context. I intend this dissertation to advance the ethnography of logistics as a discrete field of inquiry into the maritime infrastructures changing the shores of the Global South, creating new supply-chain subjectivities, and altering how commodities move in the world...|$|R
40|$|Considering {{that every}} {{disaster}} {{is unique and}} doing research during natural disasters is difficult, we show the possibility to learn from solutions of logistics research. One main problem of logistics planning in cases of natural disasters is relief good distribution. While this problem belongs to the class of vehicle routing problems (VRP) under uncertainty, the task of <b>transshipping</b> relief <b>goods</b> needs to be considered more intensively. Especially, assigning trucks to doors to load or discharge has a high impact {{on the performance of}} a transshipment facility. In our approach, known and specially developed scheduling heuristics are applied to logistic operations in disaster relief. Therefore, we transfer the given problem of relief goods handling to transshipment of less-than-truckload (LTL) items. Here, our main objective is to improve efficiency of handling relief goods in terminals under consideration of urgent shipments. Based on limited resources for cargo handling in disaster areas, various weights and sizes of relief goods, time-sensitive shipments like medicaments or food, improper truck arrival times and different departure times, we apply and evaluate several strategies to schedule trucks in the unloading process. We apply and compare strategies to schedule incoming trucks, buffer areas and handling equipment like forklift trucks based on real data. Therefore, we developed fast decision algorithms to react to uncertain and changing information. Additionally, six different scheduling heuristics were developed to solve the complex problem of planning the utilization of unloading gates, one buffer area belonging to each unloading zone and a fleet of forklift trucks. The algorithms allow the implementation into a real-time system...|$|R
5000|$|The Treaty of Balta Liman was a {{commercial}} treaty signed in 1838 between the Ottoman Empire and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, regulating international trade. Duties were set at 3% on imports; 3% on exports; 9% on transiting exported goods; and 2% on transiting imported goods. Given {{the tradition of}} the [...] "Most Favored Country Status," [...] these conditions were extended to France. The Ottomans also agreed to the abolition of all monopolies. Factors that helped shape the treaty included the writings of David Urquhart, who had advocated for the abolition of monopolies (of which opium was the most prominent outside of Egypt) in order to bolster further trade with the Ottoman Empire and decrease British dependency on Russian raw materials. There were also numerous complaints by British businessmen who were subject to duties levied on <b>goods</b> <b>transshipped</b> across the Ottoman Empire and arbitrary levies by local pashas. These duties were mainly confined to the realm of exports, while imports could be traded at ports for the traditional rate of 3%.|$|R
50|$|On the {{economic}} legislation, the Cavalier parliament had a notable Mercantilist bent. To promote the English cloth industry, it outlawed the exportation of raw materials, such as wool, raw hides and fuller's clay (1662) and forbade {{the importation of}} finished materials like lace and embroidery (1662). It repealed old domestic restrictions on linen manufacturing (1663). To encourage {{the development of the}} American colonies as raw-material producers and consumers of English manufactured goods, the Cavalier parliament confirmed and reinforced the Navigation Act passed by the prior parliament in 1660, with the new Staple Act in 1663, requiring foreigners trading with the American colonies to <b>transship</b> their <b>goods</b> through English ports. Old corn laws were adjusted to the advantage of English farmers: the old restrictions on the exportation of wheat was gradually relaxed, exportation becoming fully free in 1670 and even subsidized with bounties after 1673. Conversely, the importation of wheat was restricted, with the first prohibitive tariffs on the importation of grains introduced in 1663 in a two-tier system, adjusted (1670) into a three-tier system based on current price. The importation of Irish cattle into Britain was forbidden (1666), giving English beef producers a protected home market (in trade, Scotland was already excluded altogether, treated as a foreign country on par with France). To facilitate the overseas operations of the charter companies, parliament inserted a clause into the 1663 Staple Act allowing the free exportation of coin and bullion - over the vigorous opposition of Arthur Annesley (Earl Anglesey), the leading mercantilist in parliament. To encourage the inflow of gold and silver from abroad and into circulation, the Coinage Act 1666 abolished seignorage, and introduced free minting at the Royal Mint.|$|R
