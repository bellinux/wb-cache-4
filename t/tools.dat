Adhesives were used to construct hafted <b>tools</b> by 70ka at Sibudu Cave in South Africa.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{machining}} efficiency of titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V {{is low and}} the <b>tool</b> wear is serious. In this paper, uncoated carbide <b>tool</b> and two kinds of coated cemented carbide <b>tool</b> were used for dry turning titanium alloy. The experiments used CCD Observing System and the EDAX analysis of SEM to study <b>tool</b> wear mechanism and analyze the cutting performance through <b>tool</b> life, cutting force and cutting temperature. The {{results show that the}} main wear reasons are adhesion, diffusion and oxidation wear. For coated <b>tool,</b> the coating peeled off first, and then <b>tool</b> substrate damaged. Compared with coated carbide <b>tool,</b> the uncoated carbide <b>tool</b> with fine grain has longer <b>tool</b> life and lower cutting force and cutting temperature. The changes of cutting force and cutting temperature with cutting speed are not obvious when using the ccomposite coating (TiAlN and AlCrN) carbide <b>tool.</b> The results can help to choose <b>tool</b> material reasonably and control <b>tool</b> wear...|$|R

40|$|Micro-end-milling {{requires}} high spindle {{rotational speed}} to achieve effective material removal. This results in the requirement of <b>tool</b> stoppage or slowdown during a micro-end-milling operation, a deterrent to productivity and to part acceptability. A circular <b>tool</b> path geometry can avoid discontinuities in the <b>tool</b> movements leading to a more consistent and smooth material removal. However, optimal process planning for such a <b>tool</b> path will require detailed understanding of the chip-formation mechanism in circular end-milling. The cut geometry during end-milling along a circular <b>tool</b> path is often approximated {{as that of a}} linear <b>tool</b> path. Although this assumption works well for circular <b>tool</b> paths with higher <b>tool</b> path radius, {{this is not the case}} for lower <b>tool</b> path radius often used in micro-milling. In this study, the effect of circular <b>tool</b> path on the cutting force for varying <b>tool</b> path rotation angle, <b>tool</b> path radius, and feed rate is experimentally investigated. Systematic signal processing was applied to analyse the measured cutting force signal along linear and several circular <b>tool</b> paths. Qualitative as well as quantitative differences were observed in the cutting force profiles obtained using different <b>tool</b> path radii, <b>tool</b> path orientations, and feed rates. This implies the need for an improved chip thickness formulation dedicated to micro-end-milling with circular <b>tool</b> path rather than approximating it with formulations derived for linear <b>tool</b> path. 9 Authors 2011.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a contribution to}} hardened <b>tool</b> steel milling studies. High speed milling is largely utilized to substitute some EDM and polishing operations, mainly in hardened <b>tool</b> steel finishing. <b>Tool</b> path strategy may either enable good surface finish or contributes to generate high roughness values and poor surface finish. <b>Tool</b> inclination (angle between <b>tool</b> axis and workpiece surface) influences the system response to vibration. In this work, several milling experiments were performed in a circular convex AISI D 6 hardened steel workpiece, having as input variables feed direction (upward and downward the circle) and tilt angle (<b>tool</b> inclination). The main results indicate that upward <b>tool</b> path presented mostly high roughness values which were also influenced by <b>tool</b> inclination. Downward <b>tool</b> path presented low roughness values and was less influenced by <b>tool</b> inclination. Upward <b>tool</b> path and positive <b>tool</b> inclination should be avoided because they presented roughness values incompatible to EDM process substitution...|$|R
