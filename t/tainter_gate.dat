5000|$|The Howard A. Hanson Dam is an earthen {{embankment}} structure at {{a length}} of 675 ft (205 m) and height of 235 ft (70 m). The base of the dam is 960 ft (290 m) wide and sits within Eagle Gorge, a ravine with nearly vertical rock walls. The reservoir withheld by the dam collects water from 220 square miles (570 m2) of drainage area 7 miles (11 km) long. The dam structure contains a concrete spillway on its left side capable of discharging overflow at [...] The spillway is controlled by two 45 x 30 ft (15 x 6 m) <b>Tainter</b> <b>gates</b> while an outlet tunnel {{at the base of}} the dam is controlled by two 10 x 12 ft (3 x 4 m) <b>Tainter</b> <b>gates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Three large {{controlled}} <b>tainter</b> <b>gate</b> chute spillways, with {{a combined}} discharge volume of , are constructed {{at the southern end}} of the dam. The three spillways measure 270 m in length, {{with a combined}} width of 48 m.|$|E
50|$|The {{water level}} of the {{reservoir}} {{is controlled by the}} five <b>tainter</b> <b>gate</b> spillways located at the eastern end of the dam, with two additional spillways located more towards to the centre of the dam. The reservoir measures approximately 8.6 km in length, with a maximum perpendicular width of 7 km.|$|E
50|$|A {{critical}} factor in <b>Tainter</b> <b>gate</b> design {{is the amount of}} stress transferred from the skinplate through the radial arms and to the trunnion and the resulting friction encountered when raising or lowering the gate. Some older systems have had to be modified to allow for frictional forces for which the original design did not plan.|$|E
50|$|The dam {{consists}} of a concrete structure 934 ft long with five roller <b>gates</b> and 10 <b>tainter</b> <b>gates.</b> The earth embankment is 17500 ft long with two submersible spillways, 938 ft long and 1338 ft long. The lock is 110 ft wide by 600 ft long.|$|R
5000|$|The main spillway, part of {{the eastern}} end of the dam, is a 861 ft long Ogee-type and {{utilizes}} twenty-one 25 ft tall and 36 ft wide <b>tainter</b> <b>gates</b> that are operated by two 60-ton hoists. The auxiliary spillways are located about 1 mi northeast of the dam and are controlled by another twenty-one 37 ft wide and 15 ft high <b>tainter</b> <b>gates</b> stretched over their combined 860 ft length. The lip of the spillways lie at an elevation of 730 ft above sea level while the tops of the gates are 755 ft. All three spillways have a combined maximum discharge of [...] The two-lane State Highway 28 crosses {{over the top of the}} dam and a bridge that stretches over the main spillway. It is accessible by cars and trucks within weight.|$|R
50|$|The dam is a {{reinforced}} concrete weir, 350 ft long and 18.5 ft tall.When the embankment wings are included the crest is 2720 ft long. The dam includes eight <b>Tainter</b> <b>gates</b> that lift {{the level of}} the river 6 ft above its normal elevation so it can be diverted into the canal.|$|R
50|$|Pressure forces {{acting on}} a {{submerged}} body act perpendicular to the body's surface. The design of the <b>Tainter</b> <b>gate</b> results in every pressure force acting through {{the centre of the}} imaginary circle of which the gate is a section, so that all resulting pressure force acts through the pivot point of the gate, making construction and design easier.|$|E
50|$|When a <b>Tainter</b> <b>gate</b> is closed, water bears on the convex (upstream) side. When {{the gate}} is rotated, {{the rush of}} water passing under the gate helps to open and close the gate. The rounded face, long radial arms and {{trunnion}} bearings allow it to close with less effort than a flat gate. Tainter gates are usually controlled from above with a chain/gearbox/electric motor assembly.|$|E
5000|$|Near {{the top of}} {{the canal}} is the dam - 603 feet long and rebuilt of {{concrete}} in 1931 and 1932. The pool created by the dam floods the canal to operate the locks. Each end of the dam has a 24-foot spillway. The middle section has eight sluiceways, each with a <b>Tainter</b> <b>gate.</b> The gates are all operated by an electrical winch which slides on a track from gate to gate - known as the [...] "crab." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{lock and}} dam complex {{includes}} an arched gravity dam, a spillway, nine <b>Tainter</b> <b>gates,</b> 18 headgates, and {{a section of}} fill dirt connecting the headgates to the embankment of the Illinois & Michigan Canal. The lock and dam are 1320 ft long, and the lock has a maximum lift of 22 ft.|$|R
2500|$|Completed in 1956, the Lower St. Anthony Falls dam is a gravity-type hydro-electric dam 26feet (8m) in height, {{consisting}} of a 275foot (84m) long concrete spillway with four <b>tainter</b> <b>gates.</b> The lower pool (sometimes called the intermediate pool) has a normal capacity of [...] and a normal level of 750feet (229m) above sea level.|$|R
5000|$|The earthen and {{concrete}} dam {{was constructed in}} 1951 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers with three <b>tainter</b> <b>gates,</b> a height of 60 feet, and 1800 feet in length at its crest. [...] It impounds the Sheyenne River for irrigation water storage and for flood control. The dam is {{owned and operated by}} the Corps of Engineers.|$|R
5000|$|Jeremiah Burnham Tainter (January 6, 1836 in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin [...] - [...] February 5, 1920) was an {{inventor}} and engineer known for having designed the <b>Tainter</b> <b>gate</b> in 1886. He began {{his work in}} hydrology in 1862, with the modification of pre-existing mill pond dams in Menomonie. [...] Tainter was employed by Knapp, Stout & Co., the largest lumber manufacturer in the United States {{in the last quarter}} of the 19th century. His brother Andrew Tainter was a principal in Knapp, Stout.|$|E
50|$|A {{side view}} of a <b>Tainter</b> <b>gate</b> resembles a slice of pie with the curved part of the piece facing the source or upper pool of water and the tip {{pointing}} toward the destination or lower pool. The curved face or skinplate of the gate {{takes the form of}} a wedge section of cylinder. The straight sides of the pie shape, the trunnion arms, extend back from each end of the cylinder section and meet at a trunnion which serves as a pivot point when the gate rotates.|$|E
50|$|The Cannelton Dam {{is located}} at river mile 720.7, below Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The dam has two sections. The main section is 1412 ft long with twelve <b>tainter</b> <b>gate.</b> The gates are held between 15 ft piers. Each gate is 42 ft high and 100 ft long. Electric hoists {{on top of the}} piers are used to raise or lower the gates.
