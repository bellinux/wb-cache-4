50|$|There {{were also}} {{two or three}} {{revisions}} of the motherboard with minor differences between them. The first version (Model 084) incorporates a 470 ohm resistor to fix a race condition between the CPU and DMA controller which created {{the possibility of the}} system locking up. In the spring of 1984, a revised motherboard (Model 083) was introduced which rearranged some components and also incorporated a better solution to the DMA race condition by utilizing a 74LS44 gate (most XT clones instead used a group of 74LS04 gates), however most of the remaining Model 084 motherboards were modified for this before the revised Model 083 appeared. The motherboard revision and that Model 086 came with the full 256 KB RAM (instead of only 128 KB RAM) from the factory were the only differences between the two first models. Unlike the IBM PC motherboard, the XT lacked the <b>trimmer</b> <b>capacitor</b> used to adjust the NTSC color burst for CGA video cards or the second set of DIP switches used to configure memory size. Slot 8 (the one closest to the power supply) was wired slightly differently for cards used to connect IBM 3270 terminals. As a result, some ISA cards will not work in Slot 8 and others included a DIP switch to accommodate it. This feature is unique to the XT and IBM Portable PC and not found on the IBM PC, AT, or any clones.|$|E
50|$|Very often, {{multiple}} stator/rotor sections {{are arranged}} behind {{one another on}} the same axis, allowing for several tuned circuits to be adjusted using the same control, e.g. a preselector, an input filter and the corresponding oscillator in a receiver circuit. The sections can have identical or different nominal capacitances, e.g. 2 &times; 330 pF for AM filter and oscillator, plus 3 &times; 45 pF for two filters and an oscillator in the FM section of the same receiver. Capacitors with multiple sections often include <b>trimmer</b> <b>capacitors</b> in parallel to the variable sections, used to adjust all tuned circuits to the same frequency.|$|R
5000|$|The Neutrodyne radio receiver, {{invented in}} 1922 by Louis Hazeltine, was a {{particular}} type of tuned radio frequency (TRF) receiver, in which the instability-causing inter-electrode capacitance of the triode RF tubes is cancelled out or [...] "neutralized". to prevent parasitic oscillations which caused [...] "squealing" [...] or [...] "howling" [...] noises in the speakers of early radio sets. In most designs, a small extra winding on each of the RF amplifiers' tuned anode coils was used to generate a small antiphase signal, which could be adjusted by special variable <b>trim</b> <b>capacitors</b> to cancel out the stray signal coupled to the grid via plate-to-grid capacitance. The Neutrodyne circuit was popular in radio receivers until the 1930s, when it was superseded by the superheterodyne receiver.|$|R
5000|$|The sets used a four-valve {{superhet}} circuit with {{an audio}} output of 4 watts at 10% total harmonic distortion; they performed {{as well as}} many pre-war sets. The valve complement consisted of a triode-hexode frequency changer, a variable-μ RF pentode IF amplifier and a high slope output pentode. A [...] "Westector" [...] solid-state copper oxide diode was used for demodulation, which saved one valve and allowed use of an available type of pentode for the audio stage. The HT line was derived from a full wave rectifier. All valves were on International Octal sockets apart from the rectifier which was on a British 4-pin base. There were minor variations between set makers; for instance Philips used IF transformers with adjustable ferrite cores (so-called slug tuning) rather than the conventional <b>trimmer</b> <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} fault detection and isolation in railway track circuits. A track circuit {{can be considered as}} a large-scale system composed of a series of <b>trimming</b> <b>capacitors</b> located between a transmitter and a receiver. A defective capacitor affects not only its own inspection data (short circuit current) but also the measurements related to all capacitors located downstream (between the defective capacitor and the receiver). Here, the global fault detection and isolation problem is broken down into several local pattern recognition problems, each dedicated to one capacitor. The outputs from local neural network or decision tree classifiers are expressed using the Dempster–Shafer theory and combined to make a final decision on the detection and localization of a fault in the system. Experiments with simulated data show that correct detection rates over 99 % and correct localization rates over 92 % can be achieved using this approach, which represents a major improvement over {{the state of the art}} reference method...|$|R
40|$|In direct-conversion receivers, radio {{frequency}} (RF) signals are down-converted to zero or low intermediate frequency (IF) using complex in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) mixers with no prior image filtering. Due to I/Q path gain and phase errors, image leaks into the signal band during the down-conversion process. A generic image rejection {{algorithm is proposed}} to reject image in the baseband using a zero-forcing sign-sign adaptive feedback concept. The orthonormal property of complex I/Q channels is exploited to update their gain and phase errors by detecting only four signs, and image is corrected with four multiplications and two additions. The correction and detection algorithms can be implemented in a digital or analog form. The analog correction circuit consists of a complex baseband sample and hold (S/H) with <b>trim</b> <b>capacitors.</b> At 40 MS/s sampling rate, the analog, 12 -b digital, and hybrid (analog correction and digital detection) image rejection circuits achieve an image rejection of 62, 65, and 65 dB, respectively.

40|$|A {{balanced}} bridge chopper circuit {{including four}} {{metal oxide semiconductor}} field effect transistors (MOSFETs) is driven by a remote oscillator connected through an isolator to modulate low-voltage low-frequency input signals at their remote source into a square wave A. C. output signal that can be conducted to a common point where it is amplified and demodulated for better linear measurement of said low-voltage signals. The oscillator is connected through the isolator to the bridge circuit {{in such a manner}} that opposing pairs of the bridge transistors are simultaneously conducting. The isolator may comprise a novel photovoltaic isolation device or it may consist of an isolation transformer or of other types of electrical isolation devices. The transistors and input and output terminals for the bridge circuit are shielded and are mounted on a heat sink consisting of a thermally conducting metal plate and/or a metal oxide single crystal which is in common with the shield and/or one terminal of the low-voltage source such that all leads and terminals are maintained at a constant temperature and preferably at the same temperature as the low-voltage source. Air currents are prevented from causing thermally induced voltages within the bridge circuit by the circuit shield and in some extreme cases by the use of a hermetically sealed shield for the critical circuit elements and connections. For accurately balancing out interelectrode capacitance-coupled gate drive to low-level channel signals, a pair of variable capacitors are connected between one output terminal of the bridge circuit and the gate of each of its two adjacent transistors. The balanced bridge chopper may be produced as a monolithic planar-silicon integrated circuit in which gate-to-channel capacitance balancing is accomplished during manufacturing in place of the variable capacitors. A novel balanced input filter and <b>trimmer</b> <b>capacitors</b> between the bridge output terminals and local ground greatly reduce 60 Hz. common mode noise. In a hybrid circuit embodiment of the bridge circuit, the individual MOSFET chips forming the bridge circuit are bonded and interconnected within a hermetically sealed and magnetically transparent metal oxide single crystalline container. Multiplexing circuitry is also disclosed for driving several chopper circuits from a single oscillator and for connecting the outputs from the chopper circuits to a single amplifier and demodulator at a remote location...|$|R
40|$|Successive {{approximation}} register (SAR) analog-to-digital Converters (ADC) {{are based}} on a capacitive digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) (McCreary and Gray, 1975). The capacitor mismatch in the capacitor array of the CDAC impacts the differential non-linearity (DNL) of the ADC directly. In order to achieve a transfer function without missing codes, <b>trimming</b> of the <b>capacitor</b> array becomes necessary for SAR ADCs with a resolution of more than 12 bit. This article introduces a novel digital approach for trimming. DNL measurements of an 18 bit SAR ADC show that digital trimming allows the same performance as analog trimming.

40|$|AbstractThe MEMS quartz gyroscope is {{composed}} by a tuning fork and the detection circuits. The tuning fork's error noise of a quartz gyroscope will have {{significant influence on}} it's performance.

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{effort to}} improve the performance of analog-to-digital converters (ADC) has led the development of several precision techniques for ADC’s. The primary objective of those precision techniques is to alleviate the accuracy constraints such as capacitor mismatch, charge injection, finite op amp DC gain and comparator offset. In the early years, the error correcting techniques like the ratio independent, reference refreshing, capacitor error-averaging, on-chip <b>capacitor</b> <b>trimming</b> and analog calibration were applied in the analog domain. The main drawback of these analog precision techniques is the complexity of circuit implementation. The digitally controlled self-calibration and digital-domain calibration techniques were introduced to eliminate the disadvantage of the analog precision techniques but developed for successive approximation and flash type ADC’s, respectively. Reduced feature size combined with lower power supply voltage are the key technology drivers resulting in reduced cost, higher speed and lower power consumption of digitally calibrated ADC’s. This thesis is basically a survey of existing digital calibration techniques for A/D converters and an attempt {{to find out the}} best suitable scheme which is suitable for wireless application keeping in mind the constraints like input signal bandwidth, power dissipation, area, static and dynamic behavior of the ADC’s. The idea presented in this dissertation have evolved from research work directed towards high resolution ADC’s capable of low power operation as well. ...|$|R
