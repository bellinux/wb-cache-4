The mean concentrations of Cu in surface runoff water were reduced by 36 % and 28 % for the navel orange and grapefruit site, respectively. The re-sults of species distribution of Cu in the runoff water using MINTEQ indicated that the application of Ca-WTR decreased the concentrations of free Cu 2 + by 61 % and 39 % for the two sites.

The P adsorption capacity of Al-WTR generated from Singapore’s water treatment plant was evaluated with reference to particle size range, adsorption pH and temperature. Column tests, with WTR amendments in sand with and without compost, were used to simulate the bioretention systems. The adsorption rate decreased with increasing WTR sizes. Highest P adsorption capacity, 15. 57 mg PO 43 −-P/g WTR, was achieved using fine WTR particles (> 50 % particles at less than 0. 30 mm). At pH 4, the contact time required to reduce effluent P concentration to below the detectable range was half compared with pH 7 and 9.

40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{immobilization}} by inactivating {{agents in}} the sediment of eutrophic lakes to reduce immediately available P in lake water is often crucial for mitigating nuisance eutrophication symptoms, such as cyanobacterial blooms. Macrophytes and phytoplankton, however, can directly utilize P from the sediment for growth. Accordingly, a comprehensive analysis of the P bioavailability in lake sediment amended with two promising P-inactivation agents, namely Phoslock® and drinking water <b>treatment</b> <b>residue</b> (DWTR), was investigated in both short- and long-term studies (20 and 180 d). Phosphorus-availability was assessed using six chemical extraction methods and Hydrilla verticillata and Microcystis aeruginosa growth tests. The results showed that Phoslock® and DWTR significantly reduced mobile P (NH 4 Cl and Na 2 S 2 O 4 /NaHCO 3 extractable P) in lake sediment, while P bioavailability that was assessed by different methods showed considerable deviations. Interestingly, appropriate bioavailable P chemical extraction methods were determined based on linear correlation analysis, and further comparison indicated that reduction of bioavailable P by DWTR ( 75 %) at recommended dosages, which was probably caused by the capability of macrophyte and cyanobacteria to utilize various fractions of P (except the residual P) in amended sediment under proper illumination. Therefore, DWTR and Phoslock® can effectively reduce P release from lake sediment, but the potential bioavailable P may pose uncertainties for eutrophication control in lakes that typically have regular sediment re-suspension.

The published article can be found at: [URL] demand for bioenergy, biofuels, and bioproducts has increased interests in the utilization of biomass residues from forest treatments as feedstock. In areas with limited history of industrial biomass utilization, uncertainties in the quantity, distribution, and cost of biomass production and logistics can hinder the development of new bio-based industries. This paper introduces a new methodology to quantify and spatially describe delivered feedstock volumes and costs across landscapes of arbitrary size in ways that characterize operational and annual management decision-making. Using National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery, the forest is segmented into operational-level treatment units. A remote sensing model based on NAIP imagery and Forest Inventory and Analysis plot data are used to attribute treatment units with stand-level estimates of basal area, tree density, aboveground biomass, and quadratic mean diameter.

Relative gas diffusivity (D/$D_ 0 $), saturated hydraulic conductivity ($K_S$) and water retention ability of the fine WTR (particle size< 3 mm), the coarse WTR (particle size 3 - 8 mm) and WTR media all displayed high ability for reuse. However, available water capacities (RAW, PAW) of the WTR and WTR media were lower than those of typical soil. The RAW and PAW of the fine WTR were higher than the coarse WTR because capillary porosity of the fine WTR which was composed of relatively small particles retained more water. The RAW and PAW of the fine media were significantly higher than those of coarse media. The plant growth with the fine medium was greater than the coarse medium in the WTR medium with an OM content of 10 %.

Char yields increased and volatile yields decreased with increasing ash content. The TRH released 40 % less tar than the BRH which was attributed to the substantially higher potassium content of the Thai species. The combustion reactivity of the TRH char in air at 773 K {{was similar to the}} BW char and almost double the reactivity of the BRH and TIR chars. The BW and TRH chars had a greater volume of macropores indicating that char combustion occurs predominantly through the growth and extension of the macroporous pore network.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Each spring, small ditches {{perpendicular}} to sugarcane rows (quarter-drains) {{that are responsible}} for transferring runoff from furrows to main ditches have to be re-conditioned to be effective. Bare soil surfaces in quarter-drains and furrows are exposed to intense rainfalls. Raindrop energy from rainfall causes detachment of soil particles and sediment transport from furrows through quarter-drains to main ditches. In time, sediment transported from furrows that accumulates in main ditches diminishes the capacity of these structures, thus requiring frequent and costly sediment cleanup. On average, yearly cost of sediment cleanup from surface ditches is $ 293 /ha. Present practice in managing post-harvest residue is burning. However, burning is a questionable management practice and has a negative effect on the environment and human health due to discharging toxic gases into the atmosphere. An alternative to burning is to leave sugarcane residue on the surface after harvest. This practice could provide multiple benefits such as reducing soil sediment, enhancing soil quality in terms of increasing soil organic carbon, and decreasing cost for cleanup of surface ditches. To evaluate these benefits, an experiment was conducted to study effects of sugarcane post-harvest residue and Polyacrylamide (PAM) applied directly to quarter-drains in spring 2003. Twelve plots (0. 1 ha each) were planted to sugarcane. For the residue <b>treatment,</b> <b>residue</b> was left on site after harvest and swept to furrows. Comparison was made with similar quarter-drains on six plots where residue was removed by burning. Treatments were: (1) residue left on the field; (2) no residue; (3) residue + PAM applied; and (4) no residue + PAM applied. Following each rainfall event, which produced runoff (four events), measurements o...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} amendments, an iron-rich water <b>treatment</b> <b>residue</b> (Fe-WTR), {{a municipal}} solid waste compost (MSW-C) and their combination (Fe-WTR + MSW-C) were added at different rates (from 2 to 4 % w/w) to three mining soils (S 1, S 2, S 3) mainly polluted with As (from 371 to 22, 661 mg·kg − 1 d. w.) and different co-occurring trace metals (i. e. Pb, Zn and Cu) to evaluate their effectiveness as metal(loid) s-immobilizing agents. After four months of soil-amendment contact, sequential extractions revealed that MSW-C and Fe-WTR induced an increase of the residual As (non-extractable) fraction. Compost was the most effective amendment at increasing the residual As in treated soils (e. g. + 16 % in S 1 -MSW-C with respect to untreated S 1), although its addition increased {{at the same time}} the exchangeable and water-soluble As fraction and the extractability of Pb, Zn and Cu, especially in S 1 -MSW-C. Leaching experiments highlighted a similar trend, with the highest cumulative fraction of As leached recorded in S 1 and S 2 soils amended with MSW-C (3. 8 and 1. 4 -fold higher than respective controls), and the lowest recorded in S 1 and S 2 soils amended with Fe-WTR (1. 2 and 1. 8 -fold lower than respective controls). On the other hand, Fe-WTR and Fe-WTR + MSW-C were the most effective at reducing the total cumulative concentration of metal (Pb, Zn and Cu) in soil leachate. The results of this study show that the amendments considered influenced with a different extent metal(loid) s mobility, and this was depending on soil and amendment characteristics, as well as the type and amount of contamination...|$|E
40|$|The {{impacts of}} crop residue {{management}} on soil microbial biomass, labile carbon and heterotrophic respiration (HR) were assessed at a long-term experimental {{site in the}} Hesbaye region in Belgium. Three <b>treatments,</b> <b>residue</b> export (RE), farmyard manure addition (FYM) and residue restitution after harvest (RR), have been applied continuously since 1959. The soil is a Eutric Cambisol with, in 2010, significantly different total soil organic carbon contents of 4. 4, 5. 1 and 5. 9 kg C m- 2 under the RE, RR and FYM treatments, respectively. Manual field HR measurements were carried out during the 2010 and 2012 crop seasons using a dynamic closed chamber system. Microbial biomass, labile C content and metabolic diversity of soil bacteria were assessed in spring 2012. Fifty-one years after {{the beginning of the}} <b>treatments,</b> <b>residue</b> management had a limited impact on HR. Based on daily averaged values, the treatment had a significant impact (α = 10 %) in 2012 but not in 2010. Based on the individual measurement dates, the treatment impact was less obvious in 2012; with the observation of a significant impact (α = 10 %) on HR in only 7 % and 36. 8 % of the measurement dates in 2010 and 2012, respectively. Labile C and microbial biomass were significantly lower in the RE treatment than in FYM and RR. Residue management had no significant effect on cold-water extracted carbon and metabolic diversity of heterotrophic soil bacteria. The limited impact of residue management on HR could be explained by (i) the relatively low amounts of recent above-ground crop inputs, (ii) the large proportion of below-ground residues and other non-exportable above-ground residues reducing the potential differences between treatments and (iii) the relatively large spatial variability of HR. In conclusion, carbon losses due to heterotrophic respiration did not differ between RE, FYM and RR treatments in the studied soil. This contrasts with the different soil organic carbon contents observed in these three treatments after fifty years of experiment. Further investigations regarding the reduction of spatial variability and the potential roles played by organic matter protection within aggregates and biochemical composition of inputs are needed.

40|$|Residue {{chopping}} from orchard pruning {{is becoming}} a common practice in conservation agriculture after the establishment of eco-conditionality policies in the European Union. This type of residue is used to protect the soil from erosion and improve the water balance and fertility of soils by improving the organic matter content. However, no studies have evaluated the influence of pruning residues and size on soil coverage. This study examines the effect of different <b>treatments</b> on pruning <b>residue</b> soil coverage in an olive orchard (cv. Picual). Treatments consisted of two quantities of pruning residues, specifically, high (2. 04 kg m- 2) and low (1. 02 kg m- 2), and two chopping speeds, low (2. 4 km h- 1) and high (3. 2 km h- 1). The different treatments were evaluated by image analysis and pixel counting to determine the soil cover percentage, size, number and distribution of the pruning residues after chopping. After chopping, the soil cover percentage was 39 % higher in the high quantity pruning <b>residue</b> <b>treatments</b> but was not significantly influenced by the chopping speed. The size and number of lignified residues was quantified via pixel counting. In the high quantity pruning <b>residue</b> <b>treatments,</b> the number of large lignified residues (> 6 cm 2) was higher, {{and the number of}} pruning residues smaller than 2 cm 2 was lower, when compared with low quantity pruning <b>residue</b> <b>treatments.</b> The high chopping speed treatments produced more smaller-sized pruning residues...|$|R
