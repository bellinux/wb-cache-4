5|$|A {{weakening}} trend soon occurred, with it weakening to a Category1 hurricane {{early on}} September15. About four days later, the hurricane completed its cyclonic loop and <b>then</b> <b>headed</b> west-northwestward. The system weakened to {{a tropical storm}} early on September20. During the next few days, the storm decelerated and turned westward. Late on September22, it weakened to a tropical depression. The depression continued westward, until dissipating at 1800UTC on September23, while located about 745 miles (1,200km) east-southeast of Bermuda.|$|E

It <b>then</b> <b>headed</b> north as Pierce Street until {{intersecting}} 66th Street, where SR 195 turned east. The highway intersected SR 86 {{and continued to}} the town of Mecca, where it met its north end at SR 111. The route loosely paralleled the northern end of the Salton Sea, passing through farmland for its entire length.|$|E

5|$|In July 1780, 5,000 veteran French troops {{led by the}} comte de Rochambeau {{arrived at}} Newport, Rhode Island {{to aid in the}} war. French naval forces then landed, led by Admiral François Joseph Paul de Grasse. At first Washington hoped to bring the allied fight to New York and to end the war there, but Rochambeau advised de Grasse that Cornwallis in Virginia was the better target. Admiral de Grasse {{followed}} this advice and arrived off the Virginia coast. Washington immediately saw the advantage created, made a feinting move with his force towards Clinton in New York, and <b>then</b> <b>headed</b> south to Virginia.|$|E

She <b>then</b> <b>headed</b> southwest to Scotland in order to intercept British warships that were heading north to defend Norway. She failed to encounter any vessels, however, and returned to Wilhelmshaven, arriving there on 4 May.|$|E

5|$|On August29, an area {{of weather}} {{developed}} directly into a tropical storm, skipping the tropical depression stage. Katrina steadily intensified as it headed west-northwest, gradually turning to the northwest. It peaked in intensity on September3 as a Category4 hurricane with winds of , the second highest of the season. Katrina <b>then</b> <b>headed</b> westward and rapidly weakened. It was downgraded into a tropical storm on September5 and a depression on September6. The last advisory was issued on September7 when Katrina dissipated. Although the hurricane brought Category3-equivalent winds to Socorro Island on September2, no damage was reported there or anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|Page and MacLachlan flew to No. 96 Squadron RAF {{which was}} then flying de Havilland Mosquito night fighters. He {{requested}} his old gunner, Les Davies, who now piloted Mosquitos to join them. Davies accepted but MacLachlan was killed before he could take up the offer. MacLachlan and Page flew to Tangmere on 15 July. On his next mission on 18 July 1943 MacLachlan's Mustang FD442 was probably hit by ground fire when crossing the French coast near Dieppe. Page noticed MacLachlan's Mustang suddenly pull up sharply from their tree-top height by about 1,000 feet. He saw MacLachlan pull back the canopy but apparently {{changed his mind about}} bailing out as the aircraft leveled out and descended. The Mustang <b>then</b> <b>headed</b> towards a small field. MacLachaln touched down three-quarters the way across and the Mustang ploughed into an orchard at the field's edge which ripped off the wings. Page orbited the crash site several times and considered landing to rescue him but the space was too confined. Page dived at the wreck and took gun-camera footage but could see no signs of life and <b>then</b> <b>headed</b> home. The Operations Record was unable to determine the cause of the crash. MacLachlan made no radio broadcast. It was possibly the result of enemy small-arms fire or mechanical failure. On 30 July MacLachlan was awarded a second Bar to his DFC.|$|E

SR 25 <b>then</b> <b>heads</b> northeast towards Logansport, going past the communities of Rockford, Burrows, and Clymers. SR 25 intersects with passing U.S. Route 24, U.S. Route 35, and State Road 29 near Logansport.

50|$|Phil Jack Dawson, <b>then</b> <b>head</b> {{coach of}} Westbrook High School in Westbrook, Maine, {{developed}} an effective {{defense against the}} wishbone offense then in use by Texas, called “backbone defense”. Dawson contacted Ara Parseghian, <b>then</b> <b>head</b> coach of the University of Notre Dame, and convinced him to use it against Texas in the 1971 Cotton Bowl Classic.

5|$|The Japanese Navy {{had trained}} {{extensively}} in night-fighting tactics before the war, {{a fact of}} which the Allies were unaware. Mikawa hoped to engage the Allied naval forces off Guadalcanal and Tulagi {{on the night of}} August 8 and August 9, when he could employ his night-battle expertise while avoiding attacks from Allied aircraft, which could not operate effectively at night. Mikawa's warships rendezvoused at sea near Cape St. George in the evening of August 7 and <b>then</b> <b>headed</b> east-southeast.|$|E
5|$|The racers <b>then</b> <b>headed</b> {{right to}} go south along Shuangyong Road and Qingshan Road, passing the Qingzhu Flyover on their way. Going northwards along Zhuxi Avenue, the race {{came up to the}} Nanning International Convention and Exhibition Center and headed east on Minzu Road before {{doubling}} back via Qingxiu Road. Tracing a path alongside The Admiral City Shopping Mall, the route went east to return the starting point of Wuxiang Square. There was little elevation on the generally flat course, which ranged between eight and twelve metres wide along the route.|$|E
5|$|The revolt in East Anglia was {{independently}} {{suppressed by}} Henry le Despenser, the Bishop of Norwich. Henry was in Stamford in Lincolnshire when the revolt broke out, {{and when he}} found out about it he marched south with eight men-at-arms and a small force of archers, gathering more forces as he went. He marched first to Peterborough, where he routed the local rebels and executed any he could capture, including some who had taken shelter in the local abbey. He <b>then</b> <b>headed</b> south-east via Huntingdon and Ely, reached Cambridge on 19 June, and <b>then</b> <b>headed</b> further into the rebel-controlled areas of Norfolk. Henry reclaimed Norwich on 24 June, before heading out with a company of men to track down the rebel leader, Geoffrey Litster. The two forces met at the Battle of North Walsham on 25 or 26 June; the Bishop's forces triumphed and Litster was captured and executed. Henry's quick action was essential to the suppression of the revolt in East Anglia, but he was very unusual in taking matters into his own hands in this way, and his execution of the rebels without royal sanction was illegal.|$|E

5|$|To {{serve the}} growing {{population}} of the council estate, the Middleton Light Railway, an electric tramway, was built in 1925 by Leeds Corporation. The tramway from Leeds ran parallel to the colliery line to Hunslet Moor staithes and <b>then</b> <b>headed</b> south through Middleton Woods to a terminus on the Ring Road. The tramway {{was made into a}} circular route in 1949 when it was extended to Belle Isle Road and Balm Road in Hunslet. The tramway closed in 1959. Its route through the park is now a footpath.|$|E
