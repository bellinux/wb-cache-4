In 1992 (Heisei 4), in the Yomiuri newspaper, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> that argued that when people thought they had heard a cat speak, upon listening a second time, they realized that it was simply the cat's meowing and that it was only coincidence that it resembled a word in human language.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{following}} the 10 March 1917, publication Regulamento do estabelecimento hidrológico das Águas Minerais de Melgaço (on the hydrological {{condition of the}} mineral waters of Melgaço), <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> in the Jornal de Melgaço (21 July) by Gregório Fernandes that referred to a dusty access road to the incomplete thermal spa, that was unforested. The buvette (pumping pavilion) was still unfinished and the sanitary conditions of the spa was little hygienically recommendable and was missing a washroom. By August, the management presented to the Repartição de Minas a plan to improve the thermal spa, under the authorship of engineer Couto dos Santos, that included {{the expansion of the}} Quinta do Peso lodgings, in accommodate 350 visitors, the construction of a casino, a gymnasium and hydrostatic lake served by swimming huts. On 8 September, though, the Ministério do Interior (Ministry of the Interior), following a complaint from the Viana do Castelo health delegation, affirmed that the bottling of the waters was made without pre-sterilization and washing of bottles.|$|E
500|$|The {{lead story}} for the first issue was [...] "Menace of the Metal Men", by A. Prestigiacomo; this was a 1933 reprint from the British edition of Argosy, but the other stories in the issue were all new. [...] Contributors {{included}} John Wyndham, Eric Frank Russell, and John Russell Fearn, {{and a couple of}} writers who were not known in the science fiction world but who had contributed to Newnes' other magazines: J.E. Gurdon and Francis H. Sibson. [...] <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> on interplanetary travel by P.E. Cleator, which continued a series of articles he had published in Scoops. [...] Newnes paid competitive rates for fiction, so they were able to attract good quality submissions, many of which were subsequently reprinted in the U.S. [...] These included Wyndham's [...] "Beyond the Screen" [...] (described by sf historian and critic Sam Moskowitz as [...] "an engrossing story"); Halliday Sutherland's [...] "Valley of Doom"; and Eric Frank Russell's [...] "Vampire from the Void", which was reprinted in Fantastic in 1972, having been submitted there by Russell's agent {{as if it were a}} new story. [...] When the editor, Ted White, was told that the story was over thirty years old, he initially denied that it was possible, but ultimately accepted that it was a reprint: science fiction historian Mike Ashley comments that this indicated Russell's fiction [...] "stood well the test of time".|$|E

2500|$|In the Skandinavisk Tidskrift för Textilindustri (Scandinavian Journal of Textile Industry), N:o 7-8, 1931, {{which was}} printed at AB Borås Tidningstryckeri in Swedish, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> about Kornél Tolnai's {{invention}} with text and pictures.

2500|$|The October {{issue of}} Star of the West made room for remembering him while news {{continued}} of `Abdu'l-Bahá's travels and speeches and {{dedication of the}} cite for the Bahá'í House of Worship near Chicago. It included a long poem Chase composed. This poem arrived in Egypt and was read to `Abdu'l-Bahá July 4, 1913. The Star of the West edition also published letters from various communities memorializing him. Tributes from Portland, OR and Chicago were also published, followed in March, 1913, by one from Beirut which included remembrance {{of those who were}} on pilgrimage and met him in 1907. A letter/poem/ode from him to `Abdu'l-Bahá was published in September, 1913 dated from August, 1912, published as a one year anniversary of the visit of `Abdu'l-Baha to his gravesite and was re-printed in 1922. The editors noted the observance held for what was called [...] "The day of Thornton Chase". It also reported more of the words `Abdu'l-Bahá had said on the visit to the gravesite:"…During his lifetime he bore many trials and vicissitudes, but he was very patient and long-suffering. He had a heart most illuminated, a spirit most rejoiced; his hope was to serve the world of humanity; during the days of his life he strove {{as much as he could}} – he never failed…" [...] <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> then published including a picture marking Chase among the people standing at a Ridván meeting in May, 1909, who lead the services that day and compared the tent raised as a precursor to the eventual building. It also included a short article by Chase [...] "The Greatest Name". An account of that first year anniversary followed in the November edition. 10 Bahá'ís attended the gravesite Sep 30th with flowers and prayers for an hour and a service was held the following Sunday in a hall which was also the anniversary of `Abdu'l-Bahá's visit and the assemblage again returned to the gravesite at sunset. A memorial comment was then published from Thomas Kelly Cheyne. In February 1914, an excerpt from Chase's book The Bahai Revelation was published in Star of the West. The anniversary was noted again in 1914, and then an article briefly reviewing the history of the religion in America by Chase was published in early 1915, and again noted the anniversary in September. A more enduring gravestone was placed in 1918. A memoriam article in 1918 noted 21 Bahá'ís attended the anniversary meeting which also saw the new stone marker. Mrs. Chase attended and shared anecdotes of his life. A picture of the gravestone was published in 1920.|$|E

I had always been rather a favourite of the old gentleman; but it is probable that, confident in the number of gigantic youths who now armed around him, he considered the destination as likely to remain a dead letter, which he inserted chiefly to show his displeasure at Rashleigh's treachery, both public and domestic. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>article,</b> by which he, bequeathed to the niece of his late wife, Diana Vernon, now Lady Diana Vernon Beauchamp, some diamonds belonging to her late aunt, and a great silver ewer, having the arms of Vernon and Osbaldistone quarterly engraven upon it.|$|E
6000|$|You {{can still}} hear very old dull men say gravely that [...] "kings are better than pronunciamentos"; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> upon Greece to this effect quite {{recently}} in that uncertain paper The New Statesman. Then a kind of illustrative gesture would {{be made to the}} South American republics, although the internal disturbances of the South American republics have diminished to very small dimensions in the last three decades and although pronunciamentos rarely disturb the traffic in Switzerland, the United States, or France. But {{there can be no doubt}} that the influence of the Germanic monarchy up to the death of Queen Victoria upon British thought was in the direction of estrangement from the two great modern republics and in the direction of assistance and propitiation to Germany. We surrendered Heligoland, we made great concessions to German colonial ambitions, we allowed ourselves to be jockeyed into a phase of dangerous hostility to France. A practice of sneering at things American has died only very recently out of English journalism and literature, as any one who cares to consult the bound magazines of the 'seventies and 'eighties may soon see for himself. It is well too in these days not to forget Colonel Marchand, if only to remember that such a clash must never recur. But in justice to our monarchy we must remember that after the death of Queen Victoria, the spirit, if not the forms, of British kingship was greatly modified by the exceptional character and ability of King Edward VII. He was curiously anti-German in spirit; he had essentially democratic instincts; in a few precious years he restored good will between France and Great Britain. It is no slight upon his successor to doubt whether any one could have handled the present opportunities and risks of monarchy in Great Britain as Edward could have handled them.|$|E
6000|$|The {{clearness}} {{of vision}} which enabled Alfred Burton now {{to live in}} and appreciate a new and marvelous world, failed, however, {{to keep him from}} feeling, occasionally, exceedingly hungry. He lived on very little, but the weekly amount must always be sent to Garden Green. There came a time when he broke in upon the last five pound note of his savings. He realized the position without any actual misgivings. He denied himself regretfully a tiny mezzotint of the Raphael [...] "Madonna," [...] which he coveted for his mantelpiece. He also denied himself dinner for several evenings. When fortune knocked at his door he was, in fact, extraordinarily hungry. He still had faith, notwithstanding his difficulties, and no symptoms of dejection. He was perfectly well aware that this need for food was, after all, one of the most unimportant affairs in the world, although he was forced sometimes to admit to himself that he found it none the less surprisingly unpleasant. Chance, however, handed over to him a shilling discovered upon the curb, and a high-class evening paper left upon a seat in the Park. He had no sooner eaten and drunk with the former than he opened the latter. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> on the front page entitled [...] "London Awake." [...] He read it line by line and laughed. It was all so ridiculously simple. He hurried back to his rooms and wrote a much better one on [...] "London Asleep." [...] He was master of his subject. He wrote of what he had seen with effortless and sublime verity. Why not? Simply with the aid of pen and ink he transferred from the cells of his memory into actual phrases the silent panorama which he had seen with his own eyes. That one matchless hour before the dawn was entirely his. Throughout its sixty minutes he had watched and waited with every sense quivering. He had watched and heard that first breath of dawn come stealing into life. It was child's play to him. He knew nothing about editors, but he walked into the office of the newspaper which he had picked up, and explained his mission.|$|E
