5|$|Following the Japanese raid on Ceylon of March–April 1942, the Eastern Fleet was {{transferred}} from its base at Trincomalee, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the Indian Ocean: Kilindi in Kenya. From there the fleet undertook local patrols, escorted convoys and occasionally despatched ships to {{operations in the}} Mediterranean. During Operation Vigorous, a convoy to Malta in June 1942, Nestor was serious damaged in an air raid and slowly sank.|$|E

5|$|The 1930s road follows Telford's road {{as far as}} Bridge of Orchy, then runs to {{the east}} of Loch Tulla, while the old road runs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> The project was criticised over spoiling the natural beauty of Glen Coe, but was defended by the Ministry of Transport who thought it would provide better {{transport}} links to Argyllshire and Inverness-shire.|$|E

Alternatively, players may decide upon a starting point on a river and a finish line farther downstream. The winner is the player whose stick first passes the finishing point.|$|E
5|$|Film {{production}} in the Indies declined after the Japanese occupation began in early 1942; the overlords forced all but one studio to close. In their place, the Japanese opened their own studio in the Indies, Nippon Eigasha, to produce propaganda for the war effort. Kartolo acted in the studio's only feature film, Berdjoang (Hope of the South), without Roekiah in 1943. After a hiatus of several years, Roekiah also acted for the studio, taking {{a role in the}} short Japanese propaganda film Ke Seberang (<b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Side)</b> in 1944. However, much of her time was spent touring Java with a theatrical company, entertaining Japanese troops.|$|E
5|$|Flatfish are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show {{a greater degree}} of asymmetry than any other vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis during the course of their development, with one eye migrating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the head, and they simultaneously start swimming on their side. This has the advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view. The upper side is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.|$|E
50|$|These {{costs will}} include the {{situation}} in which a party has incurred unnecessarily due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side's</b> conduct.

5|$|However, Henry's army never progressed {{further than}} Leith; there the army could keep in {{physical}} {{contact with the}} supporting fleet. Henry took a personal interest in his convoys, at one point even verbally instructing that two Scottish fishermen fishing in the Firth of Forth were to be paid £2 for their (unspecified) assistance. However, Henry never besieged Edinburgh Castle where the Duke of Rothsay was ensconced. By now, Brown says, Henry's campaign {{had been reduced to}} a 'war of words.' By 29 August, the English army had returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the border.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to tamp down on the unrest, martial law was {{declared}} and military governor General Martín Perfecto de Cos established headquarters in San Antonio de Béxar, stationing his troops at the Alamo. When the Texian volunteer soldiers gained control of the fortress at the Siege of Béxar, compelling Cos to surrender on December 9, many saw his expulsion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the Rio Grande {{as the end of}} Mexican forces in Texas. Most Texian soldiers in Béxar left to join a planned invasion of Matamoros, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In the west, NY164 splits {{off from}} NY311 a short {{distance}} east of I-84. It crosses under the Metro North tracks three times, including two one-lane underpasses with limited sight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> It passes along the northern base of a small mountain and turns slightly southward. The highway turns due eastward and intersects with County Route64 in the hamlet of Towners. Just to the north is Mandel Pond, and the route makes a series of erratic turns around small mountains, passing south of Cornwall Hill as it does so. NY164 turns south-southeast and ends at NY22 in Patterson, east of the East Branch Croton River.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{measuring}} the resistivity of isotropic samples of finite dimensions {{in the form}} of rectangular parallelepipeds using the four-probe technique was considered. Two variants of contact arrangements were studied: (1) four collinear probes are positioned on one side of a sample symmetrically with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>sides,</b> and (2) two probes on one side of a sample and two on the opposite side are placed precisely in opposite positions and symmetrically with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> sample (the Schnabel method). Solutions of the problem of the electric field potential distribution in a sample for different positions of the current contacts were found. The solutions were obtained {{in the form of}} double series and methods of their summation are presented. The obtained results are extended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> case of measuring the resistivity of anisotropic samples when the resistivity tensor has two independent components. The results of using the developed technique for measuring the resistivity of such a highly anisotropic material as highly oriented pyrolitic graphite using the Schnabel method are presented.

5|$|Integer {{powers of}} 2 are {{important}} in computer science. The positive integer powers 2n give the number of possible values for an n-bit integer binary number, e.g. 28 = 256 different values for 1byte. For a given number the binary number system denotes {{on one side of}} the binary point all the positive integer powers of 2, that are contained in the integer part of this number, and the negative powers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the binary point represent the fractional part. This system is consistently used to represent numbers in computers for hardware reasons.|$|E
5|$|Modeste {{was clearly}} {{visible in the}} harbour, {{anchored}} at the mole near two tartanes (small Mediterranean sailing craft here armed with four guns and carrying crews of around 70 men). The senior officers of the squadron held a council {{to determine the best}} course of action, and decided that since diplomatic options had failed and the Genoese appeared to support the French, the British would resort to a military solution. On the afternoon of 5 October Bedford was slowly warped into the harbour and alongside Modeste, as Reeve launched the ship's boats from Captain and brought them close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the French frigate.|$|E
5|$|Quickly, the Austrians {{acquired}} {{control of}} all the earthworks of the town, the village itself, and the fortress; their skirmishers reached {{one side of the}} abutment of an old bridge of palisades, and advanced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side,</b> across the islands formed by branches of the Kinzig and the Rhine. There, almost within eye-shot of the French sentinels, they halted; there is some confusion about why they stopped. Possibly they mistook the abutment for the bridge itself, as Moreau seemed to think. Regardless, the troops there did not burn the bridge, but started plundering and drinking. The French cavalry tried to retire into Kehl via the Kinzig bridge, but the heavy Austrians fire destroyed most of them.|$|E

5|$|Arriving at the Necromanteion, the reunited crew is {{attacked}} by Clytius, Pasiphaë, {{and a group}} of their minions. Each of the demigods uses some aspect of their newly strengthened powers or identities to help defeat these monsters; for example, Hazel's new power and alliance with Hecate helps her defeat Pasiphaë and Clytius. During the questers' journey in the mortal world, Percy and Annabeth have been travelling through Tartarus <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the Doors of Death, aided by the Titan Iapetus (Bob) and a few other beings. As the other demigods fight in the world above, Percy and Annabeth's group reaches the Doors and fights the personification of Tartarus to destroy the chains holding the Doors in place. Bob stays behind amongst hordes of angry monsters to defend the Doors while Percy and Annabeth escape. Once the full quest group is safely reassembled in the mortal world, Reyna arrives on her dying Pegasus. Annabeth says that Reyna, as a Roman, should bring the Athena Parthenos (in the Argo IIs hold) back to Camp Half-Blood to appease both the Greeks and Romans, with Nico and Coach Hedge volunteering to accompany her.|$|E
5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E
40|$|Prior {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} partisans to a conflict {{tend to have}} an exaggerated sense of the extremism of their opponents' opinions regarding the issues under dispute. In this study, we examine an ongoing conflict between the Nez Perce Tribe and local non-Tribal governments that operate {{within the boundaries of}} the Nez Perce Reservation. This survey is different from previous research in two important ways. First, we distinguish between the officials and constituents {{on each side of the}} conflict. Second, compared <b>to</b> <b>other</b> conflicts studied, <b>the</b> current conflict has greater personal relevance for those surveyed. The conflict in question is not about abstract policies or third parties, but rather about specific potential actions that directly benefit one <b>side</b> at <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side's</b> expense. An affinity for actions that benefit one's own <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side's</b> harm we call "offensiveness" and an antipathy toward actions that harm one's own <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side's</b> benefit we call "defensiveness. " The results indicated that participants themselves were more defensive than offensive. However, participants consistently exaggerated the offensiveness of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side's</b> officials, but not <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side's</b> constituents. Participants tend <b>to</b> underestimate <b>the</b> defensiveness of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> for both officials and constituents. ...|$|R

5|$|Pasvikdalen {{has been}} {{populated}} since the Stone Age; archeological {{findings from the}} Komsa culture have been dated back to 4000 BC. About 2300 BC there was immigration from Finland and later the area was largely used by Skolts for reindeer husbandry.

This was followed up by Russian immigration <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the border. The road was extended to Grensefossen in 1939 and after 1945 the population on the Russian side was forcefully moved by the Soviet authorities and the area depopulated.
