40|$|Distributed {{allocation}} and multiagent coordination {{problems can}} be solved through combinatorial auctions. However, most of the existing winner determination algorithms for combinatorial auctions are centralized. The PAUSE auction {{is one of a}} few efforts to release the auctioneer from having to do all the work (it might even be possible {{to get rid of the}} auctioneer). It is an increasing price combinatorial auction that naturally distributes the problem of winner determination amongst <b>the</b> <b>bidders</b> in such a way that they have an incentive to perform the calculation. It can be used when we wish to distribute the computational load among <b>the</b> <b>bidders</b> or when <b>the</b> <b>bidders</b> do not wish to reveal their true valuations unless necessary. PAUSE establishes <b>the</b> rules <b>the</b> <b>bidders</b> must obey. However, it does not tell us how <b>the</b> <b>bidders</b> should calculate their bids. We have developed a couple of bidding algorithms for <b>the</b> <b>bidders</b> in a PAUSE auction. Our algorithms always return the set of bids that maximizes <b>the</b> <b>bidder’s</b> utility. Since <b>the</b> problem is NP-Hard, run time remains exponential on the number of items, but it is remarkably better than an exhaustive search. In this paper we present our bidding algorithms, discuss their virtues and drawbacks, and compare the solutions obtained by them to the revenue-maximizing solution found by a centralized winner determination algorithm...|$|R

25|$|Takeover paper. Convertibles have a {{place as}} the {{currency}} used in takeovers. <b>The</b> <b>bidder</b> can offer a higher income on a convertible than the dividend yield on a bid victim’s shares, without having to raise the dividend yield on all the bidder’s shares. This eases the process for a bidder with low-yield shares acquiring a company with higher-yielding shares. Perversely, the lower the yield on the bidder’s shares, {{the easier it is}} for <b>the</b> <b>bidder</b> to create a higher conversion premium on the convertible, with consequent benefits for the mathematics of the takeover. In the 1980s, UK domestic convertibles accounted for about 80pct of the European convertibles market, and over 80pct of these were issued either as takeover currency or as funding for takeovers. They had several cosmetic attractions.|$|E

40|$|Combinatorial auctions (CAs) where bidders can bid on {{bundles of}} items {{can be very}} {{desirable}} market mechanisms when the items sold exhibit complementarity and/or substitutability, so <b>the</b> <b>bidder's</b> valuations for bundles are not additive. However, in a basic CA, <b>the</b> <b>bidders</b> may need to bid on exponentially many bundles, leading to di#culties in determining those valuations, undesirable information revelation, and unnecessary communication. In this paper we present a design of an auctioneer agent that uses topological structure inherent in the problem {{to reduce the amount}} of information that it needs from <b>the</b> <b>bidders.</b> An analysis tool is presented as well as data structures for storing and optimally assimilating the information received from <b>the</b> <b>bidders.</b> Using this information, the agent then narrows down the set of desirable (welfare-maximizing or Pareto-e#cient) allocations, and decides which questions to ask next. Several algorithms are presented that ask <b>the</b> <b>bidders</b> for value, order, and rank information. A method is presented for making the elicitor incentive compatible...|$|R
30|$|Electronic auction {{is mainly}} in the {{following}} three forms: English auction, {{which is the most}} common form of trade, is identified with the property that prices are non-decreasing.

The goods will be sold to <b>the</b> highest <b>bidder.</b> <b>The</b> first-price sealed-bid auction, <b>the</b> <b>bidders</b> will seal <b>the</b> bids. After the auction, the auctioneer opens the tenders and publishes the highest bid.

25|$|Consignee and {{consignor}} - as {{pertaining to}} auctions, the consignor (also called the seller, {{and in some}} contexts the vendor) is the person owning the item to be auctioned or the owner's representative, while the consignee is the auction house. The consignor maintains title until such time that an item is purchased by a bidder and <b>the</b> <b>bidder</b> pays the auction house.|$|E
25|$|In an English auction, a dummy bid is a bid {{made by a}} dummy bidder {{acting in}} {{collusion}} with the auctioneer or vendor, designed to deceive genuine bidders into paying more. In a first-price auction, a dummy bid is an unfavourable bid designed {{so as not to}} become the winning bid. (<b>The</b> <b>bidder</b> does not want to win this auction, but he or she wants to make sure to be invited to the next auction).|$|E
5000|$|The {{existence}} result holds {{regardless of}} the valuations of <b>the</b> <b>bidders</b> - they may have arbitrary utility functions on indivisible goods. In contrast, if all auctions are done simultaneously, a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium does not always exist, even if <b>the</b> <b>bidders</b> have subadditive utility functions.|$|R
50|$|If {{there is}} a lower bidder and a higher <b>bidder,</b> <b>the</b> {{rational}} strategy for <b>the</b> lower <b>bidder</b> is to bid zero knowing that it will lose. <b>The</b> higher <b>bidder</b> will bid a value slightly higher and approaches zero {{in order to maximize}} its payoff, in which case <b>the</b> lower <b>bidder</b> has <b>the</b> incentive to outbid <b>the</b> higher <b>bidder</b> to win.|$|R
50|$|The {{interesting}} {{challenge in}} such a game {{is to find a}} Bayesian Nash equilibrium. However, this is not easy even when there are only two <b>bidders.</b> <b>The</b> situation is simpler when the valuations of <b>the</b> <b>bidders</b> are i.i.d. random variables, i.e.: there is a known prior distribution and the valuations of <b>the</b> <b>bidders</b> are all drawn from the same distribution.|$|R
25|$|Games {{with five}} hands or more {{typically}} modify partnership pinochle {{in a variety}} of ways. They are generally played with 1 1/2 or doubled decks, with extra dix added or withheld to make an even deal. With an odd number of players, <b>the</b> <b>bidder</b> asks for a desired card in the trump suit, with the first matching player being partner for that hand. Everyone else plays against the team. In larger groups, one or more players can sit out each hand allowing the remaining players to follow the appropriate rules for the respective number of players.|$|E
25|$|Nil: A {{player that}} has already looked at their cards can bid Nil. The object of <b>the</b> <b>bidder</b> is to take no tricks during the hand. The player's partner may make a normal bid and then help them by {{attempting}} to take tricks the Nil bidder would otherwise take. In solo/cutthroat spades, successful Nil bids are rare {{since there is no}} partner to help by taking the bidder's higher cards. If the Nil bidder takes no tricks, he receives the Nil bonus; if unsuccessful, the player or team subtracts that bonus. More than one player (opponents or teammates in partners) may bid Nil on a deal.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with the}} UK's non-frustration {{principle}} directors always {{still have the}} option to persuade their shareholders through informed and reasoned argument that the share price offer is too low, or that <b>the</b> <b>bidder</b> may have ulterior motives that are bad for the company's employees, or for its ethical image. Under common law and the Takeover Code, directors must give out information to shareholders relevant to the bid, but not merely recommend the highest offer. The overriding common law rule, however, is to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest, which precludes using management powers for the purpose of frustrating takeovers. In Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd the director, purportedly concerned that a takeover bidder would make many workers redundant, issued a block of company shares to a trust, thus ensuring <b>the</b> <b>bidder</b> would remain outvoted. Buckley J held the power to issue shares creates fiduciary duty to only do so for the purpose of raising capital. Directors cannot plead they acted in good faith if a court determines their interests may possibly conflict. The result is that even though directors may wish to protect employees and stakeholders from ominous bidders, the law responds in other ways. UK workers have a minimal measure of job security, with very limited rights to be consulted, and no formal rights outside collective bargaining to participate in elections for the board or codetermine dismissal issues in works councils. Employees do have rights before dismissal or redundancies to reasonable notice, dismissal only for a fair reason, and a redundancy payment, under the Employment Rights Act 1996. Moreover, any changes to workers terms and conditions, or redundancies, following a restructuring through an asset (as opposed to share) sale triggers protection of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 meaning good economic, technical or organisational reasons must be given.|$|E

25|$|For {{repayment}} of the Government loans, {{there was}} a proposal to create an 'asset pool' at the bank, of a size greater than the loans. <b>The</b> <b>bidder</b> would have issued bonds against this asset pool, with maturities set inline with the repayment.

25|$|By 2009, {{suggestions}} of a rivalry between Modi and N. Srinivasan surfaced. During 2009–10, Lalit Modi oversaw the bidding process for induction {{of two new}} teams in the Indian Premier League. In December 2009, he inserted two new clauses in {{the invitation to tender}} (ITT): <b>the</b> <b>bidder</b> should have a net worth of at least USD 1 billion and must provide a bank guarantee of USD 100 million. Modi stated that these clauses protected BCCI's interests. However, other BCCI board members claimed that he was rigging bids to suit Adani Group and Videocon Group, as the new clauses would rule out most of the other prospective bidders. After the ITT was floated on 22 February 2010, some of the prospective bidders, including Sahara Group and Jagran Group, complained to the BCCI President Shashank Manohar that they were being deliberately kept out of the tendering process. After receiving only two bids, IPL changed the ITT, removing the net worth clause and reducing the guarantee amount to USD 10 million.|$|E
25|$|English auction, {{also known}} as an open {{ascending}} price auction. This type of auction {{is arguably the most}} common form of auction in use today. Participants bid openly against one another, with each subsequent bid required to be higher than the previous bid. An auctioneer may announce prices, bidders may call out their bids themselves (or have a proxy call out a bid on their behalf), or bids may be submitted electronically with the highest current bid publicly displayed. In some cases a maximum bid might be left with the auctioneer, who may bid on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>bidder</b> according to the bidder's instructions. The auction ends when no participant is willing to bid further, at which point the highest bidder pays their bid. Alternatively, if the seller has set a minimum sale price in advance (the 'reserve' price) and the final bid does not reach that price the item remains unsold. Sometimes the auctioneer sets a minimum amount by which the next bid must exceed the current highest bid. The most significant distinguishing factor of this auction type is that the current highest bid is always available to potential bidders. The English auction is commonly used for selling goods, most prominently antiques and artwork, but also secondhand goods and real estate.|$|E

The swim takes five-ten minutes, with both the rider and the observers on hand to assist horses, especially foals, who may {{have a hard time}} with the crossing. Before the swim, the herd is evaluated and mares in the late stages of pregnancy and those with very young foals are removed from the herd to be trailered between the islands. During the swim, some lactating mares become affected with hypocalcemia, which is treated by on-site veterinarians. Larger foals are auctioned the next day and the majority of the herd, including any young foals, are returned to Assateague on Friday.

[...] The Council reversed itself and awarded the contract to the lowest bidder. Cleveland also asked the state legislature to form a Commission to develop a plan to improve the sewer system in Buffalo at a much lower cost than previously proposed locally; this plan was successfully adopted.
