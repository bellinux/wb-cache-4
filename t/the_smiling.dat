5|$|In 1928, Joehana {{opened the}} Romans Bureau, which was advertised as {{offering}} {{a variety of}} services, including the writing and printing of advertisements, translations (from or into English, Dutch, Malay, and Sundanese), and the preparation of story concepts for other writers. Joehana may have also opened a writing course, although apparently most of his income {{was derived from the}} royalties of his publications. These publications, particularly his novels, were generally inspired by the types of works that were popular at the time of writing. One of his students, Abdullah Syafi'i Sukandi, recalled that Nangis Wibisana (The Tears of Wibisana) had been written when the dangding (a traditional lyrical form) Tjeurik Oma (Oma's Cry) was popular, whereas Goenoeng Gelenjoe (<b>The</b> <b>Smiling</b> Mountain) had been written during a period of increased interest in humorous anecdotes.|$|E
25|$|After he {{finished}} reading his poem, a black hood was placed over <b>the</b> <b>smiling</b> Guiteau's head and {{moments later the}} gallows trapdoor was sprung, the rope breaking his neck instantly with the fall. Guiteau's body was not returned to his family, as {{they were unable to}} afford a private funeral, but was instead autopsied and buried {{in a corner of the}} jailyard. Upon his autopsy it was discovered that Guiteau had the condition known as phimosis, an inability to retract the foreskin, which at the time was thought to have caused insanity that led him to assassinate Garfield.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Whitman {{joined a}} New Jersey State Police patrol in Camden, New Jersey. During the patrol, the {{officers}} stopped a 16-year-old African American male named Sherron Rolax, and frisked him. The police found nothing on him, but Whitman frisked the youth herself, too, while {{a state trooper}} photographed the act. In 2000, the image of <b>the</b> <b>smiling</b> governor frisking Rolax was published in newspapers statewide, which drew criticism from civil rights leaders who saw the incident as violation of Rolax's civil rights and Whitman's endorsement of racial profilingespecially since Rolax was not arrested or found to be violating any law. Whitman later told the press that she regretted the incident, and pointed to her efforts in 1999 against the New Jersey State Police force's racial profiling practices.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTIntroductionThe {{correlation}} between the aesthetic characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> and <b>the</b> facial biotype, could be useful {{in the design of}} the treatment plan. ObjectivesTo assess the relationship between Facial Biotype and <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> aesthetics evaluating <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> arc and <b>the</b> presence or absence of buccal corridors in subjects with normocclusion. MethodsFrom a sample of 100 subjects with normocclusion, 40 of them were randomly selected, 22 women and 18 men between 18 to 25 years, without temporomandibular joint or periodontal problems and without prior orthodontic treatment. Fontal photographs of social or posed smiles were used to determine <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> arc (consonant or not consonant) and the presence or absence of buccal corridors. Results 82. 5 % of the subjects showed a brachifacial biotype, with presence of buccal corridors and a consonant smile arc. No statistically significant relation was found between the facial biotype and <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> arc or with the presence or absence of buccal corridors. ConclusionsAesthetic characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> such as <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> arc and buccal corridors are present in subjects with normocclusion and are not affected by the facial biotype...|$|R

25|$|Later, {{from the}} 9th to 13th centuries, the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu Khmer Empire {{dominated}} vast {{parts of the}} Southeast Asian peninsula, and its influence was foremost {{in the development of}} Buddhist art in the region. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. The royal patronage for Khmer Buddhist art reached its new height with the patronage of Jayavarman VII, a Buddhist king that built Angkor Thom walled city, adorned with <b>the</b> <b>smiling</b> face of Lokeshvara in Angkor Thom dvaras (gates) and prasat towers Bayon. Angkor {{was at the center of}} this development, with a Buddhist temple complex and urban organization able to support around 1million urban dwellers. A great deal of Cambodian Buddhist sculpture is preserved at Angkor; however, organized looting has had a heavy impact on many sites around the country.|$|E
25|$|Traditional phonics {{instruction}} {{can also}} have the unintended consequence of promoting dysfluency. The difficulty lies in the coarticulated nature of speech; speech sounds are overlapping, while print is discrete and sequential. This can be appreciated if one shapes the mouth in position to begin to produce the word cat compared to the word cot. The initial hard c is colored by the subsequent vowel even before speech begins, i.e., <b>the</b> <b>smiling</b> position as one prepares to say cat, and the more limp position as one prepares to say cot. As early readers work from left to right, beginning with the onset consonant, they typically {{do not yet know}} the vowel with which it must be coarticulated. The vowel sound itself cannot be known until the remaining rime (the portion of the syllable beginning with the vowel and extending to its end: e.g. ight in right) is fully encountered. For these reasons, teaching reading through orientation to rime first and then adding the onset (ought-bought) can be helpful in promoting fluency through supporting the phonological problems of coarticulation. Emphasis on the rime also supports the development of an intuitive, and therefore more fluent, awareness of orthographic patterns.|$|E

500|$|Although Paul {{changed his}} ways to an extent, he still {{shows signs of}} being evil. Dennis has stated that he and fellow cast member, Alan Fletcher (Karl Kennedy) {{purposely}} portray hints of his former self. Of this Dennis stated: [...] "I like to keep that boiling under the surface so that the audience will always think 'what is he up to next?'. You never quite know if he will burst out into Mr. Evil or stay as the character {{he is at the}} moment. Alan Fletcher keeps it alive as well, by always looking out {{the corner of his eye}} and thinking 'I just don't trust you!'" [...] Dennis later defended his character to the Birmingham Post after he was branded an evil character, describing him in his early years: [...] "Paul started out as a university student, which people have forgotten, he was studying engineering then, much to his father's disgust, left to join an airline and became a trolley dolly. He later became a bit of a cad but I wouldn't call him a villain. I'd describe him as a bad boy with a conscience". Dennis has also stated that he loves playing Paul as a [...] "baddie", because in his opinion he is so colourful, not just an average bad guy, adding: [...] "He's not just a black and white bad guy, he's a sneaky bastard. He's <b>the</b> <b>smiling</b> baddie".|$|E

Shawn's name for Gus in this episode is [...] "Lodge Blackmunn", a direct {{reference to the}} Black and White Lodge. Leo the Cinnamon Owl is a reference to Killer BOB, who possessed Leland Palmer and often {{took the form of}} an owl. The sheriff's deputy is Deputy Frost, named after Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost. The doctors of both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks have coconuts in their offices. Both Paula's and Laura's diaries described meetings with [...] "J". Sheriff Jackson tells Bob he needs to be strong for his wife. Dr Hayward says the same thing to Leland Palmer in Twin Peaks. Upon entering the town Gus mentions that the residents are looking {{at him as if he}} were the first black man they had ever seen. There are very few black men in Twin Peaks. When they enter the Sawmill Diner Bob Barker says [...] "Top of the morning to you." [...] In the first season of Twin Peaks, Pete Martell corrected Josie Packard on the saying. Maudette wears an orchid in her hair; Harold grew orchids in Twin Peaks. In the library Shawn asks if they can [...] "poke around" [...] but he and Gus immediately say [...] "peek" [...] in correction. Thus [...] "peek", as in Twin Peaks, is spoken twice. A man wearing a hat in the Sawmill Diner gives Shawn and Gus a thumbs up. The older room service attendant did the same thing to Agent Cooper in Twin Peaks. A record player is featured prominently in both the Barker and Palmer homes. The Roadhouse was also a location in Twin Peaks. Both Maudette and Audrey Horne love to dance. Paula's friend Jack is completely blind in one eye, referencing Twin Peaks' brothel named [...] "One Eyed Jacks". In the library Shawn and Gus find a book entitled [...] "Putt Your Way to a Better Future." [...] After Leland Palmer killed Maddy Ferguson he was seen putting golf balls around in his living room. When Randy is using the table saw it resembles the sawmill scene from the extended opening credits of Twin Peaks. When Maudette is placed in the body bag it is bent in such a way that it resembles a smile, like <b>the</b> <b>smiling</b> bag clue Agent Cooper found. On Maudette's desk beside her computer is a roll of green tape like the kind used by Leland Palmer to tie up Jacques Renault. In the cabin Bob Barker lights a match and holds it up like Leland Palmer did when describing BOB to Agent Cooper. Bob Barker wears a gold ring on his pinky, something Agent Cooper did in Twin Peaks. In the cabin the walls are red with red drapes as an allusion to the [...] "Red Room" [...] in Agent Cooper's dream.|$|E
5000|$|Primatologist Signe Preuschoft traces <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> {{back over}} 30 million years of {{evolution}} to a [...] "fear grin" [...] stemming from monkeys and apes who often used barely clenched teeth to portray to predators {{that they were}} harmless, or to signal submission to more dominant group members. <b>The</b> <b>smile</b> may have evolved differently among species and especially among humans. Apart from Biology as an academic discipline that interprets <b>the</b> <b>smile,</b> those who study kinesics and psychology such as Freitas-Magalhaes view <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> as an affect display that can communicate feelings such as love, happiness, glee, pride, contempt, and embarrassment.
