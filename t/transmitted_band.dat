40|$|Stereo imaging {{requires}} {{two different}} perspectives of the same object and, traditionally, a pair of side-by-side cameras would be used but are not feasible for something as tiny as a less than 4 -mm-diameter endoscope {{that could be used}} for minimally invasive surgeries or geoexploration through tiny fissures or bores. The proposed solution here is to employ a single lens, and a pair of conjugated, multiple-bandpass filters (CMBFs) to separate stereo images. When a CMBF is placed in front of each of the stereo channels, only one wavelength of the visible spectrum that falls within the passbands of the CMBF is transmitted through at a time when illuminated. Because the passbands are conjugated, only one of the two channels will see a particular wavelength. These time-multiplexed images are then mixed and reconstructed to display as stereo images. The basic principle of stereo imaging involves an object that is illuminated at specific wavelengths, and a range of illumination wavelengths is time multiplexed. The light reflected from the object selectively passes through one of the two CMBFs integrated with two pupils separated by a baseline distance, and is focused onto the imaging plane through an objective lens. The passband range of CMBFs and the illumination wavelengths are synchronized such that each of the CMBFs allows transmission of only the alternate illumination wavelength bands. And the transmission bandwidths of CMBFs are complementary to each other, so that when one transmits, the other one blocks. This can be clearly understood if the wavelength bands are divided broadly into red, green, and blue, then the illumination wavelengths contain two bands in red (R 1, R 2), two bands in green (G 1, G 2), and two bands in blue (B 1, B 2). Therefore, when the objective is illuminated by R 1, the reflected light enters through only the left-CMBF as the R 1 band corresponds to the transmission window of the left CMBF at the left pupil. This is blocked by the right CMBF. The <b>transmitted</b> <b>band</b> is focused on the focal plane array (FPA) ...|$|E

40|$|Multistatic {{interferometric}} {{synthetic aperture}} radar (InSAR) is a promising future payload for a small satellite constellation, providing a low-cost means of augmenting proven “large” SAR mission technology. The Space Flight Laboratory at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies is currently designing CanX- 4 and CanX- 5, a pair of formation-flying nanosatellites slated for launch in 2009. Once formation flight has been demonstrated, a future multistatic InSAR formation-flying constellation can exploit sub-centimeter inter-satellite baseline knowledge for interferometric measurements, {{which can be used}} for a myriad of applications including surface deformation, digital terrain modeling, and moving target detection. This study evaluates two commonly proposed InSAR constellation configurations, namely the Cartwheel and the Cross-Track Pendulum, and considers two ‘large’ (~kilowatt) SAR transmitters (C- and X-band) and one microsatellite transmitter (X-band, 150 W). Each case is evaluated and assessed with respect to the available interferometric baselines and ground coverage. The microsatellite X-band transmitter is found to be technically feasible, although the lower available transmitter power limits the operating range. The selected <b>transmit</b> <b>band</b> determines the maximum allowable cross-track baseline between receiver satellites in the constellation. Additionally, the Cartwheel and Cross-Track Pendulum configurations offer different available baselines and ground coverage patterns, namely, the Cartwheel eliminates the near-zero cross-track baseline component that contributes to DEM height errors but adds a coupled along-track baseline, while the Cross-Track Pendulum offers the advantage of independent cross-track and along-track baseline components.
