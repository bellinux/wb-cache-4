5|$|On December 27, 1880, Wyatt {{testified that}} White's {{shooting}} was accidental. Brocius expressed regret, {{saying he had}} not intended to shoot White. Gunsmith Jacob Gruber testified that Curly Bill's single-action revolver was defective, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> at half-cock. A statement from White before he died was introduced stating that the shooting was accidental. The judge ruled that the shooting was accidental and released Brocius. Brocius, however, remained intensely angry about how Wyatt had pistol-whipped him and became an enemy to the Earps. Virgil was also appointed acting town marshal of Tombstone.|$|E
5|$|A large press gang from Aigle, of {{more than}} 50 marines and sailors, led by Wolfe, put ashore in Portland on 2 April 1803. In {{what became known as}} the Easton Massacre, a scuffle broke out between the {{inhabitants}} and Wolfe's forces. Several civilians were shot and four were killed, while sixteen members of the press gang received injuries. Nine were wounded so seriously they had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discharged.</b> Wolfe and three officers stood trial for murder but were acquitted and left Portland, aboard Aigle, on 10 April to continue their patrol in home waters. Taking a French frigate, Franchise on 28 May, Aigle went on to capture six merchant vessels over the course of a week. A French privateer, Alerte, of 14 guns was taken on 27 September, off Vigo.|$|E

5|$|During the Civil War, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton {{promised a}} Medal of Honor to every {{man in the}} 27th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment who {{extended}} his enlistment beyond the agreed-upon date. The Battle of Gettysburg was imminent, and 311 men of the regiment volunteered to serve until the battle was resolved. The remaining men returned to Maine, but with the Union victory at Gettysburg the 311 volunteers soon followed. The volunteers arrived back in Maine in time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> with {{the men who had}} earlier returned. Since {{there seemed to be no}} official list of the 311 volunteers, the War Department exacerbated the situation by forwarding 864 medals to the commanding officer of the regiment. The commanding officer only issued the medals to the volunteers who stayed behind and retained the others on the grounds that, if he returned the remainder to the War Department, the War Department would try to reissue the medals.|$|E

5|$|Grissom sought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>{{discharged}}</b> {{as the war}} neared its end, {{and married}} Betty Moore on July 6, 1945. They married at the First Baptist Church in Mitchell while on leave, and his brother Norman served as his best man. He was discharged from the army in November 1945. Grissom {{took a job at}} Carpenter Body Works, a local bus manufacturing business, and rented an apartment in Mitchell. He had trouble earning a sufficient income and was determined to attend college. Using the G.I. Bill for partial payment of his school tuition, Grissom enrolled at Purdue University in September 1946. During his time in college, Betty returned to live with her parents and took a job at the Indiana Bell Telephone Company while he worked part-time as a cook at a local restaurant. Grissom took summer classes to finish early and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering in February 1950.|$|E
5|$|He re-embarked for England in June 1916, and re-joined his {{battalion}} on the Western Front in October. Once {{back with}} his battalion, he was accidentally wounded and then gassed, and was also promoted {{to the rank of}} lance corporal. In January 1918 he was awarded the Military Medal for bravery in the field, which involved rescuing a wounded man under fire. He was then promoted to corporal. During the capture of Merris in June, he killed an eight-man German machine gun crew, saving his platoon from annihilation, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. During this action he was severely wounded. He returned to Australia <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discharged,</b> and was employed by the South Australian Railways over many years before dying in 1953, having suffered for years with bronchitis and emphysema. He was buried with full military honours in the AIF Cemetery, West Terrace. His medal set is displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial.|$|E
5|$|Liddell's {{official}} debut for Liverpool came in {{the third}} round of the FA Cup, the first competitive football tournament to be organised in post-war England. He started in the first leg against Chester City on 5 January 1946 and scored in the 30th minute. The match ended in a 2–0 win and featured several additional debutants, including Bob Paisley, who would forge a chemistry with Liddell as a left half. League football completed its first full season under the provisional North and South divisional system, which facilitated the restoration of national football for the 1946–47 season. Although he established himself in the North League, scoring 17 goals in 42 matches, Liddell had yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> from the RAF and did not accompany Liverpool during its post-season tour of North America in May 1946. His unavailability extended to pre-season training and the first two matches of the 1946–47 season. On 7 September, Liddell registered his first official league appearance and scored twice in a 7–4 defeat of Chelsea.|$|E

5|$|The Australian War Cabinet {{approved}} the Department of Post-War Reconstruction's proposed principles to govern demobilisation on 12June 1944. The {{key element of}} these principles was that {{the order in which}} personnel would be demobilised was to be based on a points system, with service men and women being allocated points {{on the basis of their}} period of service, age, marital status and employment or training prospects. An extensive demobilisation plan was then developed by an inter-service committee following further consultation with trade unions, employers and returned servicemen. This plan was accepted as the basis for planning by the War Cabinet on 6March 1945. The rate at which personnel were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> was set at 3,000 a day for six days a week and was to be capable of being increased in the event of an emergency.|$|E
5|$|The {{demobilisation}} {{plan was}} put into action on 16August 1945, the day after Japan surrendered. At this time the military had a strength of 598,300 men and women. Of these, 310,600 were in Australia, 224,000 were serving in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) and 20,100 were in Britain {{and other parts of}} the world. The only personnel <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> during August and September were former prisoners of war and those with a long period of service, however, as general demobilisation did not begin until 1October 1945. During the intervening months dispersal centres were established in each state and territory's capital city. These centres were to provide information on employment, land settlement, housing, training, loans, tools for trades and other benefits for service personnel as their discharges were processed. Lieutenant-General Stanley Savige was appointed the Coordinator of Demobilisation and Dispersal in September.|$|E
5|$|Willkie's {{condition}} only worsened as {{the weeks}} went on. He went to New York by rail in mid-September, but on the trip he was stricken with another heart attack. Although his advisors told him to seek treatment and abandon the trip, Willkie pressed on. When he arrived in New York, Willkie was in great pain and his press secretary called an ambulance {{to take him to}} Lenox Hill Hospital. He recovered to some extent, enough so that his friends expected him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discharged.</b> He spent time working on the galleys of his second book, An American Program, and planned future projects. On October 4, Willkie caught a throat infection, which was treated with penicillin. As he was recovering, Willkie's now chronic heart attacks struck again and he suffered three more attacks on October 7. The hospital, which had been issuing reassuring bulletins to the public, was now forced to inform the public that Willkie's condition had worsened and that he was critically ill. The next morning, Willkie suffered one last attack which proved fatal. From the time he checked into Lenox Hill Hospital, he was said to have suffered over a dozen heart attacks.|$|E

5|$|Of {{near miss}} events, {{obstetrical}} fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain {{one of the}} most serious and tragic. Although corrective surgery is possible it is often not available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarian section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this condition, with the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus in the birth canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual fetal death, necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (fistula) allowing urine or feces, or both, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> through the vagina with associated urinary and fecal incontinence, vaginal stenosis, nerve damage and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences are also likely to follow, with shunning of the women. Aprt from lack of access to care, causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End Fistula, which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula every year. Prevention includes discouraging teenage pregnancy and child marriage, adeaquate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including caesarian section.|$|E
