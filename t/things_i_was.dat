500|$|Director Kim Manners, {{realizing the}} monotony {{of some of the}} scenes, such as Mulder waking up after each {{successive}} explosion, attempted to make each camera angle interesting. He diagrammed every camera angle and move to make the scenes visually appealing and hold the viewers' attention. First assistant director Bruce Carter examined the script and created a complex timeline to make shooting easier. It took him two weeks to break all the episode's elements into their exact timings, but Carter considered it a success: [...] "It was one of the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> proudest of all year." ...|$|E
500|$|Qureshi was {{initially}} scheduled {{to make her}} film debut with Billa II, a Tamil gangster-thriller, directed and produced by Chakri Toleti, after surviving an audition out of 700 candidates. Although cast as the female lead, when the film was delayed, Qureshi left the project to honour other work commitments. When asked whether she had any regrets, she said: [...] "I have no regrets. I wish it had worked out, but it didn't. I am not someone who sits and laments over <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> approached for several other south films too, but the roles weren't what I was looking for".|$|E
500|$|Following her {{critical}} {{success with}} Walk the Line, Witherspoon admits to spending several years [...] "kind of floundering career-wise". Reflecting on {{this period of}} time in a December 2014 interview, Witherspoon attributed it to her separation from her first husband in October 2006 and their subsequent divorce, stating that she spent [...] "a few years just trying to feel better. You know, you can't really be very creative when you feel like your brain is scrambled eggs." [...] She claims that she [...] "wasn't making <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> passionate about. I was just kind of working, you know. And it was really clear that audiences weren't responding to anything I was putting out there." ...|$|E

500|$|Because Confessions was his {{directing}} debut, Clooney {{took inspiration}} from friends Steven Soderbergh and the Coen brothers for his filmmaking style. Writer Charlie Kaufman {{said he was}} dissatisfied with the way Clooney treated the screenplay. [...] "I {{spent a lot of}} time working on the script," [...] he explained, [...] "but I don't think he was interested in the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> interested in. I've moved on and I don't have any animosity towards Clooney, but it's a movie I don't really relate to." [...] Clooney acknowledged that Kaufman's original script contained [...] "really funky scenes that would never reach the green light of being a studio film." [...] A drug addiction subplot was removed based on Barris's request for historical authenticity.|$|E
500|$|Smith had {{attempted}} to go to rehab several times, but {{found that he was}} unable to relate to the popular treatments for addicts that used a twelve-step program basis for treatment. [...] "I couldn't do the first step [...] I couldn't say what you were supposed to say and mean it." [...] In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center, [...] "What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you're on a drip bag, but the only thing that's in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> even on an antipsychotic, although I'm not psychotic." ...|$|E
500|$|Patti Smith {{had a great}} {{influence}} on Iyall. [...] " [...] someone who was both a rock singer and a poet," [...] she said. [...] "She combined <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> interested in. Plus, she wasn't a trumped-up sex symbol. She was herself on stage. That appealed to me. It looked like something I could do. You didn't have to look {{like all the other}} singers." [...] Iyall was highly critical of the music of the day and found inspiration in other mediums. [...] "I hate rock and roll right now. It's turned into some new kind of stupid [...] religion... I'd rather listen to Billie Holiday, maybe Tom Waits. [...] Actually, I'll admit I like The Bangles – they have a great sound. But I'd just as soon read novels or paint pictures as listen to music. I love language – plain speech, used in an enigmatic, subliminal way; I'm not [...] much tied to the literal." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{the episode}} was {{originally}} broadcast, {{there was a}} strong negative reaction from some viewers. As Deep Space Nine was shown in syndication, one channel in the Southern United States took the step of editing out the kiss from the initial broadcast. Echevarria's mother told him that they should have issued a parental guidance warning before broadcasting it. More responses were received at the production office from viewers than for any other [...] episode of the series, resulting in several staff members having to take turns on the phones in order to cover the load. The staff found that although the majority of the phone calls were negative about [...] "Rejoined", the letters were mostly positive. Terry Farrell said in a 2015 interview that [...] "Rejoined" [...] was her favourite episode of all time and that she still had people thanking her for the episode, because [...] "it gave them strength, and that it made them feel like they weren't alone, it inspired them to be themselves—all the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hoping it would do." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{releasing}} {{her third}} studio album Artpop, Gaga held a private event in New York known as ArtRave, where she performed {{songs from the}} album and showcased art pieces. Later, she took the concept of ArtRave and created ArtRave: The Artpop Ball tour. After abruptly cancelling the North American leg of her previous Born This Way Ball (2012–13) tour due to a major hip injury, the tour began with its first leg in the United States on May 4, 2014, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. ArtRave: The Artpop Ball had the singer visiting cities where she canceled tour dates in order to undergo the surgery, as well as playing new cities. Gaga explained to The Independent: [...] "When I'm onstage with the Artpop Ball, {{the point of the}} show is to take what was the mess of my life and make art of it – to raise the spirit of artistic dreams and creativity and take all the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> feeling in pain about, and rage... I take a much more meditative approach to the performance. I've got wide-open ears. The ArtRave has routines, and there's a performance-art aspect that has been designed." [...] Prior {{to the beginning of the}} tour, Gaga headlined six shows (March 28, 30, 31 and April 2, 4, and 6) at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan, New York, and these shows were the final performances at the venue. A seventh show was also added for April 7 and officially closed the venue.|$|E
2500|$|Miller {{was an only}} child, whose musical {{interests}} began [...] "sometime as a six {{or seven}} year old, listening to the Monkees and the Beatles". However, his earliest musical influences were wider-ranging, springing from his father's [...] "immense record collection – lots of Broadway show tunes. But the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really interested in were these New York folk scene records... the Womenfolk being really prototypical. And after {{that it was the}} Beatles all the way. They were gods walking the earth to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, Ai sat on {{the jury}} of an {{international}} initiative to find a universal Logo for Human Rights. The winning design, combining {{the silhouette of a}} hand with that of a bird, was chosen from more than 15,300 suggestions from over 190 countries. The initiative's goal was to create an internationally recognized logo to support the global human rights movement. In 2013, after the existence of the PRISM surveillance program was revealed, Ai said [...] "Even though we know governments do all kinds of <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> shocked by the information about the US surveillance operation, Prism. To me, it's abusively using government powers to interfere in individuals' privacy. This is an important moment for international society to reconsider and protect individual rights." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2016, Keys {{initiated}} a #NoMakeup movement, where she wrote on Lenny [...] "Before I started my new album, I wrote {{a list of}} all the things that I was sick of. And one was how much women are brainwashed into feeling like we have to be skinny, or sexy, or desirable, or perfect. One of the many <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> tired of was the constant judgment of women. The constant stereotyping through every medium that makes us feel like being a normal size is not normal, and heaven forbid if you're plus-size. Or the constant message that being sexy means being naked". Keys presented her movement at various events, and received a range of both complimentary and critical responses.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was while}} in school that Pisemsky started writing. [...] "My 5th form teacher of {{literature}} credited me with having talent; in the 6th form I wrote a novella called The Circassian Girl, {{and in the}} 7th a still longer one entitled The Iron Ring, both worthy of mention, apparently, only as stylistic exercises, dealing {{as they did with}} <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> totally ignorant of at the time," [...] Pisemsky remembered. He sent The Iron Ring (a novel telling of his first romantic passion) to several Saint Petersburg journals and met with all-round rejection. Several months later, already a university student, he gave the novel to Stepan Shevyryov. The professor's reaction was negative and he made a point to discourage the young man from writing about things he knew nothing about.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{believed}} {{that although he}} played right-handed as an adult, Hogan was actually left-handed. In his book [...] "Five Lessons," [...] in the chapter entitled [...] "The Grip," [...] Hogan said [...] "I was born left-handed -- that was the normal {{way for me to}} do <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> switched over to doing things right-handed when I was a boy but I started golf as a left-hander because the first club I ever came into possession of, an old five-iron, was a left-handed stick." [...] This belief also seemed to be corroborated by Hogan himself in his earlier book [...] "Power Golf." [...] However, some mystery still remains about this since Hogan in subsequent interviews said that the belief of him being left-handed was actually a myth (noted in what was probably his last video interview and in his 1987 Golf Magazine interview).|$|E
2500|$|Smith's {{major new}} car program {{prior to the}} 1984 reorganization, GM10 (also known as W-body), has been called [...] "The biggest {{catastrophe}} in American industrial history." [...] Beginning in 1982, and costing $7 billion, {{the plan was to}} replace all midsize cars produced by Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick. The plan was huge in scope, calling for seven plants that would each assemble 250,000 of the cars, or 21% of the total U.S. car market. It was badly executed from the start, but the 1984 reorganization wrought havoc on the program and it never recovered. By 1989, the year before the last of the original GM10s were launched, GM was losing $2000 on every one of the cars it produced. When asked by Fortune why GM10 was such a catastrophe, Smith replied, “I don't know. It's a mysterious thing. I've said I'll take my share of the blame on all those <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> part of the team.” Nonetheless, the W-body platform that sprouted from the GM10 program lasted in production in some form until 2016.|$|E
