From a theoretical point of view it can be argued that the true test of the solidarity of <b>the</b> <b>friendship</b> tie comes at its breaking point. If one could learn more about conditions associated with dissolution, one might learn something about <b>the</b> nature of <b>friendship</b> itself, and perhaps about other relationships. From a practical, or applied, point of view there might be times when the breakup of a tie should be predictable and perhaps preventable. However, by the same token it might be desirable to weaken or terminate a particular tie because of its effects upon the individuals concerned. For the professional practitioner who is involved in and concerned with inter-personal relationships in group helping situations, the con-scious intervention repertoire should include knowledge about the dissolution process as much as about the formation process...|$|R

40|$|A basic {{tenet of}} folkloristics {{is that the}} folk group is the centre for the creation, {{adaptation}} and dissemination of folklore. Analysis {{of different kinds of}} folk groups yields {{a deeper understanding of the}} processes and patterns of folklore. Although the friendship-based group is one of the most pervasive and highly valued groups in our society today, folklorists have neglected it. A search of the literature reveals that anthropologists, sociologists and psychologists, but not folklorists, have written extensively about friendship. Yet our discipline could certainly enhance understanding of <b>the</b> <b>friendship</b> <b>bond,</b> <b>friendship</b> groups, and their expressive behaviour with its own perspective and approach. This thesis is intended to show that traditional and conventional expressive behaviour is vital to the identity of <b>the</b> <b>friendship</b> group, and that <b>the</b> <b>friendship</b> group is a significant source of folklore. [...] This study has four research objectives. The formation of the identity of the study group, which is the focus of the first objective, is analysed not only from the perspective of the folklore of the group but also with consideration of its history and the relationships amongst its members. The two main themes of this friendship group's folklore are fantasy and competition. The second purpose is to discover how a friendship group established its identity. In the case of the group under consideration, the creation and maintenance of a distinctive folklore, particularly humour, is the central means to this end. This folklore is concentrated in four areas: conversational genres, including personal experience narratives, wordplay, quotations, boasts and taunts set in the context of various conversational styles; humour, in the form of situational joking and in-jokes; the transformation of mass-mediated culture into small group folklore, most notably recorded music, paperback science fiction and fantasy novels, and movies and television; and games, being war-games and fantasy role-playing games. The third research objective is to determine how the factor of all-male membership influences group folklore and identity. Masculine culture has been so taken for granted by most scholars that it has seldom been the focus for study, and even then the approach has rarely been satisfactorily rigorous. Competitiveness, as mentioned above, is the element of male culture most strongly evidenced in this group, but other elements such as an orientation to success and avoidance of emotional expressiveness, are also to be found, always in distinctive folkloric patterns. The final research objective concerns the manner in which a group transforms the products of mass-mediated culture into items of in-group folklore. No modern, urban folk group is unaffected by the mass media, but this does not destroy its folklore; rather, the content of such media is incorporated into the group's folklore and transformed in the process. This group, as indicated above, chooses certain areas of popular culture appropriate to its' members age and leisure orientation...|$|R
40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to examine for the older deaf adult some of the {{important}} factors such as influence of early life experiences, the deaf community, communication techniques, peer group relationships, and social relations which together have created adaptive strategies. The necessity of adjusting to deafness in early life and its influence on the adjustment to the aging process also were examined. ^ Utilizing the field approach (ethnographic, naturalistic), information was obtained through interview and participant-as-observer techniques for twenty-two deaf people aged fifty-five and over representing varying educational, occupational, and economic backgrounds. The age range for the eleven males and eleven females was fifty-five to eighty-four while the median age of the participants was sixty-three. Fourteen participants were prelingually deaf and eight were postlingually deaf. ^ The researcher found that of the early life experiences one of the most influential was that of education. The educational program, with its emphasis on either the oral or manual method of communication, was of paramount importance because of its ramifications throughout the participants 2 ̆ 7 lives and subsequent development of adaptive strategies. The emergence of a peer-based society in middle childhood and the strengthening of <b>the</b> <b>friendship</b> <b>bonds</b> throughout their lifespan was found to reap benefits for the older deaf adult. The researcher also found that the deaf used voluntary organizations throughout their lives to maximize sociability, a process which began early in their lives. ^ Additional findings include the concept that over half of the participants felt the deaf population is treated as a minority group. Feelings of stigmatization which existed appeared to be more related to the use of sign language than to deafness itself. ^ A major implication to be drawn from this study is the attitude of acceptance of their handicap and the carryover of this attitude to the participants 2 ̆ 7 approach to the aging process. Adaptive strategies developed by the older deaf adult over the lifespan in confronting stigmatization, discrimination, social isolation from the hearing world, and treatment as a minority group may assist the deaf adult in making the transition from middle life to later maturity. ...|$|R

30|$|Para-social {{interaction}} {{is a concept}} that was first introduced to explain the interaction between audience and people in the media, and it gives the audience a sense of intimacy just as they have a face-to-face relationship with the persona (Horton and Richard Wohl 1956). At this time, persona is the object that appears in mass media such as radio, movie, and television, not an object to communicate directly like a friend (Horton and Richard Wohl 1956; Labrecque 2014). However, since the intimacy that the audiences feel towards the persona is similar to the intimacy that they feel towards real friends, the relationship between the audiences and the persona formed through the mass media can be seen as virtual friendship. Para-social {{interaction is}} <b>the</b> psychological <b>friendship</b> and <b>bond</b> that media users have even though they are physically distant from the person in the mass media.

Schneider, Atkinson, and Tardif (2001) conducted a meta-analysis of studies conducted up to 1998 to corroborate that contention. They found a significant but small to moderate effect size (r =. 20). Their finding that studies of <b>friendship</b> <b>bonds</b> had higher effect sizes than studies of other interpersonal relationships has important theoretical ramifications. The present brief report is a meta-analysis that covers research conducted for the same purpose since 1998. The sample consists of 44 studies with a total of 8505 participants. The overall effect size r of. 19 (adjusted r =. 12; 95 % confidence interval,. 08 -. 17) in the current study was similar in magnitude to the effect size reported in the 2001 meta-analysis, documenting consistency in the predictive power of attachment theory.

The Time 4 Love single was recorded for a music video shortly after Lips joined. The single was extremely well received and placed in the top 5 of the national rock charts. Their new national popularity lead to the band getting out of Cape Town more and their first solo tour to Gauteng. This was when Hogs first met up with the two other main pioneers of the SA scene, Leek & The Bouncing Uptones from Pretoria and Fuzigish from Joburg. In late 1999 the band was invited to play at their first major mainstream festival at the 3 Passes Festival in Wolseley, Western Cape. The Hogs were supposed to play at 18:00 on the Friday night, however, dummer Mybergie had got arrested {{on the way to the}} festival for possession of illegal substances. The band eventually managed to get him out, but only in time to play the 22:00 headline slot. Mybergie claimed at the time, [...] "This shows you, crime does pay." [...] In 2000 The band recorded the single Just a Lie for the Croakroom Records compilation. Croakroom was an independent label from Joburg and the compilation featured international bands such as Nofx, Millencolin and New Found Glory alongside South African bands such as Hog Hoggidy Hog, Fuzigish, Leek & the Bouncing Uptones, Pet Flyz (Pretoria), Humphrey the Teacup (Joburg), Crossingpoint (Durban) and The Vendetta Cartel (Joburg).
