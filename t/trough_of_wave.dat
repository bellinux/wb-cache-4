The present pollution condition of heavy metal and {{heavy metal accumulation}} rule were studied by Index of geo-accumulation index, latent ecological risk index method and elements accumulation index method. The research suggested that 1, The heavy metal Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr content trend in XINYANGGANG tidal land is basically the same and this tend do not change between before and after return a turn, but the undulate scope of heavy metal become narrow and The wave crest and <b>trough</b> <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> have a lagged trend. 2, After researching the heavy metal content of surface tidal land, you can find that change of heavy metal Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr are lower one by one in order from high tidal land to low tidal land, but the degree of this change is different. Change of Cu, Ni, Zn content are obvious, {{at the same time}} the change of Cr, Pb content are not obvious. 3, The heavy metal Pb, Cr content in XINYANGGANG tidal land express accumulated character, and Pb content of XINYANGGANG is 300 % of that of Jiangsu province soil, whose EF is 3. 774. All that suggest that XINYANGGANG tidal land have Pb pollution. 4, RI of XINYANGGANG is 23. 552, this suggest that though XINYANGGANG tidal land have some heavy metal pollution an...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} of focused wave groups with a vertical wall is investigated {{based on the}} second order potential theory. The NewWave theory, which represents the most probable surface elevation under a large crest, is adopted. The analytical solutions of the surface elevation, velocity potential and wave force exerted on the vertical wall are derived, {{up to the second}} order. Then, a parametric study is made on the interaction between nonlinear focused wave groups and a vertical wall by considering the effects of angles of incidence, wave steepness, focal positions, water depth, frequency bandwidth and the peak lifting factor. Results show that the wave force on the vertical wall for obliquely-incident wave groups is larger than that for normally-incident waves. The normalized peak crest of wave forces reduces with the increase of wave steepness. With the increase of the distance of focal positions from the vertical wall, the peak crest of surface elevation, although fluctuates, decreases gradually. Both the normalized peak crest and adjacent crest and <b>trough</b> <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> forces become larger for shallower water depth. For focused wave groups reflected by a vertical wall, the frequency bandwidth has little effects on the peak crest of wave elevation or forces, but the adjacent crest and trough become smaller for larger frequency bandwidth. There is no significant change of the peak crest and adjacent trough of surface elevation and wave forces for variation of the peak lifting factor. However, the adjacent crest increases with the increase of the peak lifting factor...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{numerical}} model is developed using the Finite Difference Method {{to determine the}} response of sandy seabed under different loading conditions. The quasi- dynamic (u-w-p) model is presented detailed in this paper. In u-w-p model, acceleration, velocity, and displacement terms are considered different for both solid and fluid phases. u- w-p model has considered sophisticated and general condition of seabed motion. The governing equations of the model are deduced from constitutive law and conservation law under certain assumptions. In the model, numerical solutions are developed by using the finite difference method (FDM) both in 1 -D with finite seabed depth and 2 -D with infinite seabed depth. Three major factors (pore water pressure, effective stress and shear stress) are assessed from the proposed models. The results show that both the effective stress and the pore water pressure {{vary according to the}} depth. When the excess pore pressures are increasing, the surface settlement of seabed can be observed. Hydraulic flow is downward at the crest o and upward below the trough of the sea wave. Thus, liquefaction depths below the crest are obviously higher than the liquefaction depth below the <b>trough</b> <b>of</b> <b>wave.</b> However, the liquefaction occurs between phase angles of p/ 2 and 3 p/ 2, instead of just under the wave crest, which indicates the existence of phase lags under wave actions. Unlike the variation of pore water pressure, the change of shear stress is relatively linear to the wave propagation. The proposed model will provide {{a better understanding of the}} mechanism of soil-wave interaction. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|E
