5|$|The encyclopedia's editors {{intended}} {{to cover the}} rise of the Bengal Delta on the physical plane, and its evolution to date, and the changing features of the formation of the delta's janapada or human settlements on the human plane. The latter includes {{the rise and fall of}} kingdoms, invasions from within and beyond and <b>their</b> <b>implications,</b> dynastic rules and administration, as well as other aspects of Bangladesh's past and present. Entries on topics after 1947 are restricted to the geographical region of Bangladesh. However, for biographical entries, the linguistic identity prevails.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} chapters {{describe in}} detail the places Wallace visited. Wallace includes numerous observations on the people, their languages, ways of living, and social organisation, {{as well as on}} the plants and animals found in each location. He talks about the biogeographic patterns he observes and <b>their</b> <b>implications</b> for natural history, in terms both of the movement of species and of the geologic history of the region. He also narrates some of his personal experiences during his travels. The final chapter is an overview of the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural divisions among the people who live in the region and speculation about what such divisions might indicate about their history.|$|E
5|$|With {{expertise}} {{in the field of}} epigenetics and in technology transfer, she promotes the movement of scientists between academia and industry, lecturing often to school students and early career scientists. Carey writes books and articles for a scientifically interested general audience. She is the author of The Epigenetics Revolution and Junk DNA: A Journey Through the Dark Matter of the Genome which explore advances in the field of epigenetics and <b>their</b> <b>implications</b> for medicine.

5|$|By 1943, Sands {{had become}} {{impatient}} with the Navy's bureaucracy. After discussing the situation with Wilson, he appeared unannounced in Santa Fe, New Mexico, {{at the office of}} Dorothy McKibbin, who had been designated to meet newcomers to Los Alamos Laboratory. After she made a telephone call to the personnel office, which had just received a desperate call for electronics people, Sands was bussed to Los Alamos. To his surprise, he was met by Jorgenson, who had just joined the Manhattan Project after leaving Clark and going to Nebraska. He immediately took Sands to the library to read Robert Serber's Los Alamos Primer, which introduced him to the basic physical principles of nuclear fission as they were known at the time, and <b>their</b> <b>implications</b> for nuclear weapon design.|$|E

25|$|All this evidence, {{both from}} the ocean floor and from the {{continental}} margins, made it clear around 1965 that continental drift was feasible and the theory of plate tectonics, which was defined {{in a series of}} papers between 1965 and 1967, was born, with all its extraordinary explanatory and predictive power. The theory revolutionized the Earth sciences, explaining a diverse range of geological phenomena and <b>their</b> <b>implications</b> in other studies such as paleogeography and paleobiology.|$|E
25|$|In many areas, {{some form}} of price {{stickiness}} is postulated to account for quantities, rather than prices, adjusting {{in the short run}} to changes on the demand side or the supply side. This includes standard analysis of the business cycle in macroeconomics. Analysis often revolves around causes of such price stickiness and <b>their</b> <b>implications</b> for reaching a hypothesized long-run equilibrium. Examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in labour markets and posted prices in markets deviating from perfect competition.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} strategists use {{scenario}} planning techniques {{to deal with}} change. The way Peter Schwartz put it in 1991 is that strategic outcomes cannot be known in advance so the sources of competitive advantage cannot be predetermined. The fast changing business environment is too uncertain for us to find sustainable value in formulas of excellence or competitive advantage. Instead, scenario planning is a technique in which multiple outcomes can be developed, <b>their</b> <b>implications</b> assessed, and their likeliness of occurrence evaluated. According to Pierre Wack, scenario planning is about insight, complexity, and subtlety, not about formal analysis and numbers.|$|E

25|$|Mauling is an agonistic {{interaction}} that {{is often}} seen among workers in yellow jacket colonies. The mauler bites the dorsum of the thorax and gaster of the maulee. Ninety-seven percent of maulings last for 10 seconds or less, but some observed maulings were as long as 4 minutes. These interactions are mostly seen amongst older workers and occur throughout colony decline and up until total colony termination. These interactions between workers usually involve only one mauler at a time, but that same mauler often attacks multiple other workers that are nearby. These behaviors and <b>their</b> <b>implications</b> are still not fully understood by scientists.|$|E
25|$|Following {{his service}} in the Senate, Lugar created a nonprofit {{organization}} that specializes in the policy areas he pursued while in office. The Lugar Center focuses on global food security, the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, foreign aid effectiveness, and effective bipartisan governance. Located in Washington, D.C., the nonpartisan Center works with academics, experts, and policymakers in order to create proposals for these 21st century issues. The Center works to highlight these specific topics and <b>their</b> <b>implications,</b> as well as educating the public on them. Lugar {{is also a member of}} Partnership for a Secure America's bipartisan Advisory Board.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, Buchloh draws {{attention}} to Beuys's fictionalisation of his own biography, which he sees as symptomatic of a dangerous cultural tendency of disavowing a traumatic past and retreating into the realms of myth and esoteric symbolism. Buchloh attacks Beuys for his failure to acknowledge and engage with Nazism, the Holocaust, and <b>their</b> <b>implications.</b> Secondly, Buchloh criticizes Beuys for displaying an inability or reluctance to engage {{with the consequences of}} the work of Marcel Duchamp. That is, a failure to acknowledge the framing function of the art institution and the inevitable dependence upon such institutions to create meaning for art objects. If Beuys championed art's power to foster political transformation, he nevertheless failed to acknowledge the limits imposed upon such aspirations by the art museum and dealership networks that served somewhat less utopian ambitions. For Buchloh, rather than acknowledging the collective and contextual formation of meaning, Beuys instead attempted to prescribe and control the meanings of his art, and often in the form of dubious esoteric or symbolic codings. Buchloh's critique has been developed by a number of commentators such as Stefan Germer and Rosalind Krauss.|$|E
