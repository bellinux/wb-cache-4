40|$|Seven {{physical}} liner properties {{were measured}} on {{three groups of}} eight liners as they aged naturally and artificially to determine: (a) the change of each measurement with age, (b) if use time before washing {{is a factor in}} the rate of change of these measurements and (c) a calibration curve for an artificial aging method. Liners were aged in three different ways: (1) on a small farm milking twice a day for three hours at a time, (2) on a large dairy milking three times per day for six hours at a time, and (3) by soaking liners in clarified butter oil at 100 °C. The physical liner measurements were: mouthpiece lip flex, mounted liner tension, mouthpiece bore, outside barrel diameter, collapsed <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>barrel</b> walls, barrel length, and total weight. Each group was measured new and at intervals during aging. Similarities and differences among the three different aging methods were noted. The change in mouthpiece flex, mounted tension, barrel length and total weight appeared to be the best predictors of change in liner condition. Artificial aging of a liner for two days in 100 °C clarified butter oil resulted in changes in mouthpiece lip flex and mounted tension similar to 840 cow milkings on a dairy farm milking for three hours at a time, twice daily.

But the finest thing within the ruin's limits was a noble linden, which the children said was four hundred years old, and no doubt it was.

5000|$|The NS-45 {{was created}} {{as a result of}} a July 1943 {{decision}} of the State Defense Committee to arm Soviet fighters with 45 mm autocannons. As with the 37 mm autocannons already installed in some Soviet and lend-lease single-engine fighters, the intended method of installation of the 45 mm gun was to have its barrel pass through the engine block and the empty propeller shaft, in this case that of the Yak-9. Consequently, the main difficulty in designing the 45 mm autocannon was the limitation imposed by the engine blocks available for this aircraft. Accounting for the diameter of the 45 mm shell, the Yak-9 engine blocks only allowed a wall <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> 4 mm for the new gun's barrel, which was almost half the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>barrel</b> wall <b>of</b> the NS-37. (Another source gives 55 mm as the diameter of opening in the engine reducer shaft, resulting in a wall <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> 3.75 mm for the NS-45 barrel relative to 7.1 mm for the NS-37 barrel, both measured at this spot which was approximately 61 cm away from the muzzle.) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{more visible}} {{difference}} is the much lighter barrel fitted to the Tabuk. The M72's barrel is finned at the rear near the hand guards and is far heavier {{than that of the}} Tabuk (or that of a standard AKM). The <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the M72's <b>barrel</b> exists to facilitate heat distribution via mass and cooling via surface area. Since the option to fire full-auto has been omitted (and it is not typical of eastern bloc long range precision rifles to use heavy barrels for accuracy) the Tabuk, like the SVD and the PSL, has a relatively light barrel.|$|R

In an effort to solve these problems without changing the traditional model, we modified the wood type and <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> vinegar <b>barrels.</b> We acetified in triplicate in <b>barrels</b> made <b>of</b> acacia, cherry, chestnut, and oak and in three wood thicknesses (15, 20, and 25 mm) in two different vinegar plants. The operating volume was set at 60 L. Reducing wood thickness improved neither maximum acetification velocity or the total length of the process, {{and in some cases}} even worsened them. The process took longer in oak barrels than in other types <b>of</b> wood <b>barrel</b> in one <b>of</b> the vinegar plants. Therefore, the choice of wood is a parameter to be considered in the wine vinegar production. Keywords: acacia, cherry, chestnut, oak, acetic acid bacteri...|$|R
40|$|In mice from 6 strains bred for {{different}} patterns of mystacial vibrissae, we studied {{the consequences of}} the presence of supernumerary whiskers for the sensory innervation of the vibrissal follicles and their cortical representation in the barrel field. The parameters were number of axons innervating individual vibrissal follicles, tangential area <b>of</b> individual <b>barrels,</b> and <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the layers in the barrel cortex. These parameters are highly constant for animals within a strain but may differ greatly between strains. For all strains, the innervation of a follicle depends on its position on the whiskerpad, the highest innervation density being at the posterolateral corner. This matches the wave of development that travels over this part of the face during embryogenesis. Although large differences exist between strains in the number of axons innervating the whiskerpad, the relative number of axons innervating the "standard" follicles of 1 row is remarkably constant. The <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>barrel</b> cortex increases from posteromedial to anterolateral for all strains. This increase is due to variations in <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the cortical output layers (II and III, V and VI). For individual barrel-follicle pairs, we calculated the ratio between cortical barrel area and axon number. The major findings were that supernumerary follicles are innervated and, given a threshold number of axons, represented by barrels; barrel area per peripheral axon differs between follicles within a row and is highest for the supernumerary elements; and for each strain there is a direct, linear correlation between axon number and barrel size, which differs significantly among certain, but not all, strains. The data allowed us tentatively to define some of the factors that {{play a role in the}} formation of brain maps and pointed to the existence of major genetic differences between mouse strains with respect to these factors...|$|R

5000|$|For simplicity, most {{refiners}} {{wishing to}} hedge their price exposures {{have used a}} crack ratio usually expressed as X:Y:Z where X represents a number <b>of</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> crude oil, Y represents a number <b>of</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> gasoline and Z represents a number <b>of</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> distillate fuel oil, subject to the constraint that X=Y+Z. This crack ratio is used for hedging purposes by buying X <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> crude oil and selling Y <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> gasoline and Z <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> distillate in the futures market. The crack spread X:Y:Z reflects the spread obtained by trading oil, gasoline and distillate according to this ratio. Widely used crack spreads have included 3:2:1, 5:3:2 and 2:1:1.
