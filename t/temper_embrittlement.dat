5000|$|Tempering quenched-steel at {{very low}} temperatures, between 66 and 148 C, will usually not have much effect other than a slight relief {{of some of the}} {{internal}} stresses. Tempering at higher temperatures, from 148 to 205 C, will produce a slight reduction in hardness, but will primarily relieve much of the internal stresses. Tempering in the range of 260 and 340 C causes a decrease in ductility and an increase in brittleness, and {{is referred to as the}} [...] "tempered martensite embrittlement" [...] (TME) range. Except in the case of blacksmithing, this range is usually avoided. Steel requiring more strength than toughness, such as tools, are usually not tempered above 205 C. Instead, a variation in hardness is usually produced by varying only the tempering time. When increased toughness is desired at the expense of strength, higher tempering temperatures, from 370 to 540 C, are used. Tempering at even higher temperatures, between 540 and 600 C, will produce excellent toughness, but at a serious reduction in the strength and hardness. At 600 C, the steel may experience another stage of embrittlement, called [...] "temper embrittlement" [...] (TE), which occurs if the steel is held within the TE temperature range for too long. When heating above this temperature, the steel will usually not be held for any amount of time, and quickly cooled to avoid <b>temper</b> <b>embrittlement.</b>|$|E

40|$|The main {{explanations}} for <b>tempered</b> martensite <b>embrittlement</b> {{are based on}} the effects of impurities and cementite precipitation on the prior austenite grain boundaries. There are some studies where the rate of work hardening is proposed as a potential reason for the brittleness. One steel was studied by means of a specially developed precision torsional testing device. The test steel had a high Si and Ni content so ε carbide and Fe 3 C appear in quite different tempering temperature ranges. The Ms temperature is low enough so that self tempering does not occur. With the testing device it was possible to obtain the true stress - true strain curves to very high deformations. The minimum toughness was always associated with the minimum of rate of work hardening.

Quenching and tempering treatments were applied to samples removed from different bars of commercial SAE 5160 steel with different P content. Three different austenitizing temperatures for quenching: 850, 900 and 1000 °C and a constant holding time of 15 minutes were used. The oil temperature for quenching was kept at 66 °C and the tempering conditions were 470, 500 and 530 °C with the necessary time for a final hardness of 45 ± 3 HRC.

50|$|Two-step {{embrittlement}} typically occurs by aging {{the metal}} within a critical temperature range, or by slowly cooling it through that range, For carbon steel, this is typically between 370 C and 560 C, although impurities like phosphorus and sulfur increase the effect dramatically.

The results indicated that the ratio of Esp/Fm could better represent the energy of transition in SPT compared with Esp.

The metallurgical factors affecting {{those types of}} embrittlement were discussed from the view point of the precipitation and growth of carbide, {{the size and shape}} of ferrite grains and the segregation of impurity elements. The first and the second types of embrittlement are induced by the secondary hardening brought about by the coherent precipitation of M 2 C. The third type is induced by the segregation of impurity elements in the grain boundary. The fourth type is possibly induced by the coarsening of M 2 C and M 7 C 3. The fifth type is induced mainly by the coarsening of ferrite grains...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of tempering temperature and environment on hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior of {{low carbon steel}} has men investigated. A range of tempered conditions was examined in air and exposed to corrosive media for observing the behavior of HE attack. Scanning electron microscopy technique {{has been used to}} examine the fracture mode associated with HE. It was revealed that the HE attack is more pronounced in specimens tempered at low temperature with the production of brittle fracture. The features indicating hydrogen induced cracking (HIC) on the fracture morphology, that is, micropores and ductile hairlines are also evident. The present results also showed that there is a strong link between <b>temper</b> <b>embrittlement</b> and hydrogen embrittlement in that changes in tempering treatment can give large varieties of HE resistance...|$|E
