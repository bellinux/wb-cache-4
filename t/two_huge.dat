In the school, there are nine classrooms, two auditoriums, a library, a cafeteria, and a utility kitchen. When the school was completed in 1960, it opened for children in grades 1–8. Later on, a kindergarten and preschool were added.|$|E
5|$|<b>Two</b> <b>huge</b> murals by Brazilian artist Cândido Portinari, {{entitled}} Guerra e Paz (War and Peace) {{are located}} at the delegates hall. The works are {{a gift from the}} United Nations Association of the United States of America and Portinari intended to execute them in the United States. However, he was denied a visa due to his communist convictions and decided to paint them in Rio de Janeiro. They were later assembled in the headquarters. After their completion in 1957, Portinari, who was already ill when he started the masterpiece, succumbed to lead poisoning from the pigments his doctors advised him to abandon.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the central}} island {{occurred}} over a drawbridge, through a pair of gatehouses on the eastern side. Caerphilly Castle's Inner East Gatehouse, based on the gatehouse built at Tonbridge in the 1250s, reinforced a trend in gatehouse design across England and Wales. Sometimes termed a keep-gatehouse, the fortification had both exterior and interior defences, enabling it to be defended even if {{the perimeter of the}} castle was breached. <b>Two</b> <b>huge</b> towers flanked the gatehouse on either side of an entrance that was protected by portcullises and murder-holes. The substantial size of the gatehouse allowed it to be used for accommodation as well as defence and it was comfortably equipped on a grand scale, probably {{for the use of the}} castle constable and his family. Another pair of gatehouses protected the west side.|$|E

5|$|Fresh {{worries about}} France, {{combined}} {{with the development of}} rifled cannon and iron-clad warships, led to the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom being established in 1859, and expressing fears about the security of the south coast. In response, Sandgate was re-equipped with heavier guns in 1859, and extensive work was carried out on Southsea. Hurst was fitted with <b>two</b> <b>huge</b> batteries of heavy rifled breech-loading guns, protected by iron armour-plate, intended for use against fast-moving enemy warships. Tilbury Blockhouse was destroyed to make way for heavier guns at the fort after 1868. Portland was readopted by army as a garrison base in 1869 in response to fears of an invasion, but it was not rearmed.|$|E
5|$|Andre {{reveals that}} an idol of Baphomet has been {{discovered}} in Paris, and George gains access to the excavation. Using the chalice, he discovers {{an image of a}} church with a square tower. George returns to the Countess, and he discovers that the biblical references show a secret area inside a well containing a chessboard mural with a river running through it. Compiling their clues, George, Nicole and Andre decide that the Templars are going to Bannockburn, Scotland. George and Nicole board a train, but she and an old woman in their compartment soon go missing. He reaches the conductor's carriage, where the old woman, Khan in disguise, throws Flap out of the carriage. However, Khan is shot and killed by another man. George and Nicole reach the church {{in time to see the}} Grand Master of the Templars acquire a power from <b>two</b> <b>huge</b> Baphomet idols—the Sword of Baphomet, or the Broken Sword. After trying to tempt George to join their ranks, the Grand Master orders the couple to be killed, but they escape with the aid of explosives. The church explodes, killing Guido, the Templars and—presumably—the Grand Master. The game ends with George and Nico on their last date on the Eiffel Tower.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the first battle, both sides set about making urgent repairs and calling up reinforcements. On 9 July a fleet of five Spanish and one French ship of the line and several frigates arrived from Cadiz to safely escort Linois's squadron to the Spanish port, and the British at Gibraltar redoubled their efforts to restore their squadron to fighting service. In the evening of 12 July the French and Spanish fleet sailed from Algeciras, and the British force followed them, catching the trailing ships in the Second Battle of Algeciras and opening fire at 11:20. A confused night action followed, in which the British ship HMS Superb cut through the disorganised allied rearguard, followed by the rest of Saumarez's force. In the confusion one French ship was captured, a Spanish frigate sank and <b>two</b> <b>huge</b> 112-gun Spanish first rates collided and exploded, killing as many as 1,700 men. The following morning the French ship Formidable came under attack {{at the rear of the}} combined squadron, but successfully drove off pursuit and reached Cadiz safely.|$|E

25|$|The Canadian chase went nowhere, with Thisara Perera and Nuwan Kulasekara getting three wickets quickly. Captain Ashish Bagai {{tried to}} lead a recovery, but once Perera took his wicket to reduce Canada to 53/5, all doubts about the result finished. Big-hitter Rizwan Cheema took 37, {{including}} <b>two</b> <b>huge</b> sixes off spinner Murali, but the latter ultimately got his wicket as Canada fell to 122 all out.

25|$|Despite the {{intricate}} details of Einem's alibi and {{his version of}} events, his story had <b>two</b> <b>huge</b> problems. It completely contradicted his initial statement of his whereabouts on 5 June 1983, {{when he said he}} had been in bed with the flu. Furthermore, the quantity of fibres on Kelvin's clothes was far too large to suggest that Kelvin was in his company for only two hours. Given these facts, on 25 May 1984, Magistrate Nick Manos ordered Einem to stand trial for the murder of Richard Kelvin.|$|E

The attraction also has an outside botanical garden which is home to many plants and wildlife native to Cornwall and the UK in general; it also has many plants that provide an important and interesting backstory, for example, those with a prehistoric heritage.|$|E
