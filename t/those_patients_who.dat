5|$|Many {{classification}} {{systems have}} been developed {{in an effort to}} predict difficulty of tracheal intubation, including the Cormack-Lehane classification system, the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), and the Mallampati score. The Mallampati score is drawn from the observation that the size of the base of the tongue influences the difficulty of intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular the visibility of the base of palatine uvula, faucial pillars and the soft palate. Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> are difficult to intubate. Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system. Under certain emergency circumstances (e.g., severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation. In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.|$|E

25|$|The only {{potentially}} {{curative treatment}} for complete rectal prolapse is surgery, however {{in those patients}} with medical problems that make them unfit for surgery, and <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> have minimal symptoms, conservative measures may benefit. Dietary adjustments, including increasing dietary fiber may be beneficial to reduce constipation, and thereby reduce straining. A bulk forming agent (e.g. psyllium) or stool softener can also reduce constipation.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} medical signal {{processing}} {{to monitor the}} patient {{with the help of}} software monitor was discussed. The main advantage of the study is that it offers, in one intelligent monitor, the fusion of multiple sources of information. The application of the Software Monitor were related to high dependency care which give satisfactory care to <b>those</b> <b>patient</b> <b>who</b> fail to meet admission criteria for intensive care. In order to develop the data visualization and fusion algorithms for the Software Monitor, database system was developed at the John Radcliffe hospital...|$|R
25|$|A few psychiatrists (including Sakel) claimed {{success rates}} for insulin coma therapy of over 80% in the {{treatment}} of schizophrenia. A few others argued that it merely accelerated remission in <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> would undergo remission anyway. The consensus at the time was somewhere in between - claiming a success rate of about 50% in patients who had been ill for less than a year (about double the spontaneous remission rate) with no influence on relapse.|$|E
25|$|The {{probability}} of resistance {{is higher in}} <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> relapse and every effort {{must be made to}} obtain a specimen that can be cultured for sensitivities. That said, most patients who relapse do so with a fully sensitive strain and it is possible that these patients have not relapsed, but have instead been re-infected; these patients can be re-treated with the same regimen as before (no drugs need {{to be added to the}} regimen and the duration need not be any longer).|$|E
25|$|Air Ambulance {{operates}} both a 24-hour {{emergency service}} and a routine service. The clinical condition of a patient determines if the transfer is on an urgent or routine basis. An urgent response is provided for patients who require immediate transport, for the clinical management of, for example, multiple trauma, labour complications, acute cardiac cases. A routine response is provided for <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> are stable and are scheduled for the next routine or elective flight to the area or receiving hospital.|$|E
30|$|Conclusions Acute hypoxemic {{patients}} with bilateral infiltrates treated with HFNC present {{a similar pattern}} of biomarkers of inflammation and injury compared with <b>those</b> ARDS <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> were directly mechanically ventilated.

25|$|An {{elective}} secondary {{procedure is}} required to place the coupling peg or post in <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> desire improved prosthetic motility. That procedure is usually delayed for at least 6 months after enucleation to allow time for implant vascularization. Technetium bone or gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans are not now universally used, {{but they have been}} used to conﬁrm vascularization before peg insertion. Under local anesthesia, a conjunctival incision is created at the peg insertion site. A hole is created into the porous implant to allow insertion of the peg or post.|$|E
25|$|Secondary care medical {{services}} {{are provided by}} medical specialists in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient. Referrals are made for <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists. These include both ambulatory care and inpatient services, emergency rooms, intensive care medicine, surgery services, physical therapy, labor and delivery, endoscopy units, diagnostic laboratory and medical imaging services, hospice centers, etc. Some primary care providers may also take care of hospitalized patients and deliver babies in a secondary care setting.|$|E
25|$|Consistent with hemispheric lateralization, {{there is}} {{evidence}} to suggest that the left and right hemispheres of the brain are responsible for different components of musical memory. By studying the learning curves of patients who have had damage to either their left or right medial temporal lobes, Wilson & Saling (2008) found hemispheric differences in the contributions of the left and right medial temporal lobes in melodic memory. Ayotte, Peretz, Rousseau, Bard & Bojanowski (2000) found that <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> had their left middle cerebral artery cut in response to an aneurysm suffered greater impairments when performing tasks of musical long term memory, than <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> had their right middle cerebral artery cut. Thus, they concluded that the left hemisphere is mainly important for musical representation in long term memory, whereas the right is needed primarily to mediate access to this memory. Sampson and Zatorre (1991) studied patients with severe epilepsy who underwent surgery for relief as well as control subjects. They found deficits in memory recognition for text regardless of whether it was sung or spoken after a left, but not right temporal lobectomy. However, melody recognition when a tune was sung with new words (as compared to encoding) was impaired after either right or left temporal lobectomy. Finally, after a right but not left temporal lobectomy, impairments of melody recognition occurred in the absence of lyrics. This suggests dual memory codes for musical memory, with the verbal code utilizing the left temporal lobe structures and the melodic relying on the encoding involved.|$|E

25|$|Long-term {{benefits}} {{have also been}} associated with <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> receive surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy. However, much remains unknown about why some patients survive longer with glioblastoma. Age of under 50 is linked to longer survival in glioblastoma multiforme, as is 98%+ resection and use of temozolomide chemotherapy and better Karnofsky performance scores. A recent study confirms that younger age {{is associated with a}} much better prognosis, with a small fraction of patients under 40 years of age achieving a population-based cure. The population-based cure is thought to occur when a population's risk of death returns to that of the normal population, and in GBM, this is thought to occur after 10 years.|$|E
25|$|Throughout its development, gaming in {{rehabilitation}} {{has gained a}} large amount of support for its differences in comparison to regular therapeutic methods. The biggest of these differences is the user engagement and enjoyment. It has been extensively shown that people feel more engaged in a gaming environment and less contained in a doctors office when interacting in a virtual reality, gaming environment. Additionally, those who are able to participate in gaming rehabilitation have also been shown to use less energy than those participating in normal therapeutic methods. While this may not be positive for all patients, this is beneficial for <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> may be elderly or have minimal energy to expend in therapy-type settings. Saving energy while still participating in therapy has proven effective for these groups of people, since they are still able to progress in their goals towards rehabilitation, but not over-work themselves in the process.|$|E
25|$|All TB regimens in {{use were}} 18 months or longer until the {{appearance}} of rifampicin. In 1953, the standard UK regimen was 3SPH/15PH or 3SPH/15SH2. Between 1965 and 1970, EMB replaced PAS. RMP began {{to be used to}} treat TB in 1968 and the BTS study in the 1970s showed that 2HRE/7HR was efficacious. In 1984, a BTS study showed that 2HRZ/4HR was efficacious, with a relapse rate of less than 3% after two years. In 1995, with the recognition that INH resistance was increasing, the British Thoracic Society recommended adding EMB or STM to the regimen: 2HREZ/4HR or 2SHRZ/4HR, which are the regimens currently recommended. The WHO also recommend a six-month continuation phase of HR if the patient is still culture positive after 2 months of treatment (approximately 15% of patients with fully sensitive TB) and for <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> have extensive bilateral cavitation at the start of treatment.|$|E
30|$|Bupropion {{has been}} {{administered}} to cancer patients during treatment, {{and it was}} found to improve their mood, facilitating the smoking cessation success. In particular, Schnoll et al. (2010) designed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial ran on a sample of 246 cancer patients (mix cancer sites). In the first arm of the study, patients received 5 counseling session, 8  weeks of NRT and 9  weeks of bupropion. In the second arm, patients received the same treatment of group 1, but bupropion was substituted by a placebo. While NRT and counseling {{was found to be}} effective in non-depressed patients, bupropion showed to be beneficial for <b>those</b> <b>patient</b> <b>who</b> reported depressive symptoms.

25|$|Mucocutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} is {{very difficult}} to treat. Treatment involves the use of pentavalent antimonial compounds, which are highly toxic (common side effects include thrombophlebitis, pancreatitis, cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity) and not very effective. For example, in one study, despite treatment with high doses of sodium stibogluconate for 28 days, only 30% of patients remained disease-free at 12 months follow-up. Even in <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> achieve an apparent cure, as many as 19% will relapse. Several drug combinations with immunomodulators have been tested, for example, a combination of pentoxifylline (inhibitor of TNF-α) and a pentavalent antimonial at a high dose for 30 days in a small-scale (23 patients) randomised placebo-controlled study from Brazil achieved cure rates of 90% and reduced time to cure, a result that should be interpreted cautiously in light of inherent limitations of small-scale studies. In an earlier small-scale (12 patients) study, addition of imiquimod showed promising results which need yet to be confirmed in larger trials.|$|E
25|$|Severe or fulminant colitis. Patients need to {{be hospitalized}} {{immediately}} with subsequent bowel rest, nutrition, and IV steroids. Typical starting choices are hydrocortisone 100mg IV q8h, prednisolone 30mg IV q12h, or methylprednisolone 16–20mg IV q8h. The last two are preferred due to less sodium retention and potassium wasting. 24-hour continuous infusion is preferred than the stated dosing. If the patient has not had any corticosteroids within the last 30 days, IV ACTH 120 units/day as continuous infusion is superior than the IV steroids mentioned above. In either case, if symptoms persist after 2–3 days, Mesalazine or hydrocortisone enemas daily or bid can be given. The use of antibiotics in those with severe colitis is not clear. However, there are <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> have sub-optimal response to corticosteroids and continue to run a low grade fever with bandemia. Typically they can be treated with IV ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. However, in those with fulminant colitis or megacolon, with high fever, leukocytosis with high bandemia, and peritoneal signs, broad spectrum antibiotics should be given (i.e., ceftazidime, cefepime, imipeneum, meropenem, etc.). Abdominal x-ray should also be ordered. If intestinal dilation is seen, patients should be decompressed with NG tube and or rectal tube.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{investigations}} into post-surgical stereopsis is {{a publication of}} 2005 that reported on a total of 43 adults over 18 years of age who had surgical correction after having lived with from constant-horizontal strabismus for more than 10 years with no previous surgery or stereopsis, with visual acuity of 20/40 or more also in the deviating eye; in this group, stereopsis was present in 80% of exotropes and 31% of esotropes, with the recovery of stereopsis and stereoacuity being uncorrelated {{to the number of}} years the deviation had persisted. A study that was published 2006 included, aside an extensive review of investigations on stereopsis recovery of the last decades, a re-evaluation of all <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> had had congenital or early-onset strabismus with a large constant horizontal divergence and had undergone strabismus surgery in the years 1997–1999 in a given clinic, excluding those who had a history of neurologic or systemic diseases or with organic retinal diseases. Among the resulting 36 subjects aged 6–30 years, many had regained binocular vision (56% according to an evaluation with Bagolini striated glasses, 39% with Titmus test, 33% with Worth 4-dot test, and 22% with Random dot E test) and 57% had stereoacuity of 200 sec of arc of better, leading to the conclusion that some degrees of stereopsis can be achieved even in cases of infantile or early-childhood strabism. Another study  found that some chronically strabismic adults with good vision could recover fusion and stereopsis by means of surgical alignment.|$|E
