5|$|Due {{to global}} demand and the {{development}} staff's desire to further Lightning's character, development began for a sequel to XIII. The game tackles {{the question of whether}} Lightning is happy after the events of XIII. Even before a sequel was greenlit, Toriyama had wanted to create a truly happy ending for the character. Lightning's outfit in XIII-2 was designed by Isamu Kamikokuryo. He worked from a rough sketch by Nomura of how Lightning should appear. <b>The</b> <b>outfit</b> was redone several times by Kamikokuryo: a qipao and a science fiction-inspired design were both discarded because they clashed with the game's atmosphere. The final design was inspired by the valkyries of Norse mythology. <b>The</b> <b>outfit</b> was meant to reflect the environment around Lightning. It features a feather motif to represent Lightning's light, delicate side and her growing powers. She was depicted as having transcended her human limits, making it difficult to depict her as a normal person.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{an outfit}} worn by model Karlie Kloss, which was {{reminiscent}} of Native American attire, sparked controversy {{due to its}} alleged stereotypical depiction of Native Americans.

Kloss apologized on her Twitter account for <b>the</b> <b>outfit</b> and expressed her support for the outfit's removal in the broadcast.|$|E

However, Angelini himself avoided arrest while there.|$|R

They proved popular with fans, however; the league revealed {{a few days}} before the game that 16,000 Flames jerseys had been sold, compared to about 6,000 Montreal jerseys.

5|$|The {{motorcycle}} sidecar missile used in one chase sequence {{was built}} by film staff at Pinewood and used a standard Kawasaki Z900 and a custom made sidecar outfit. The sidecar was made large enough so that a stuntman could lie flat inside. It had two 10 inch scooter wheels on each side, a Suzuki 185 engine and the detached projectile was steered through a small solid rubber wheel at the front. A heavily smoked perspex nose allowed the stuntman sufficient visibility to steer the device whilst being entirely hidden from view. A pincer type lock held the sidecar in place until operated by the pilot via a solenoid switch. The sequences involving <b>the</b> <b>outfit</b> were speeded up as {{the weight of the}} sidecar made <b>the</b> <b>outfit</b> very difficult to control.|$|E
5|$|Fernandez was {{approached}} by fellow designer and stylist Formichetti to produce the dress, with it planned out {{over the course of}} a week, Formichetti having styled the look.

5|$|The Chhera Pahara (sweeping with water) is a {{significant}} ritual associated with the Ratha Yatra.

As per the custom, although the Gajapati King has been considered the most exalted person in the Kalingan kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannatha. This ritual signifies that under the lordship of Jagannatha, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign and the humblest devotee.|$|E

Cole took to the stage of The X Factor Live Results Show later that evening to perform the song for the first time. She adorned a military-themed outfit by Welsh fashion designer Julien MacDonald. It consisted of a sheer bodysuit, a red military jacket with black epaulettes {{as well as other}} details, black harem trousers and Alexander Wang boots. <b>The</b> <b>outfit</b> itself was subject to media attention, with some reporting that online debates had drawn comparisons to <b>the</b> <b>outfit</b> worn by 1992 video game antagonist M. Bison from the Street Fighter series. Media also considered Cole's outfit and performance inspired by Janet Jackson. Media speculated that the performance was mimed, something that Cole denied though she admitted to having some pre-recorded vocals to help the live performance. The show, which also featured the first UK performance by Whitney Houston in six years, drew a record audience of 14.8million, making it the most watched episode in the show's history at that time.|$|E

5|$|For Super Street Fighter IV, a third outfit {{intended}} {{to resemble the}} Chinese jiangshi was included, consisting of a long Chinese robe, black hat with his ponytail extruding from the top, yellow and black striped pants, and a yellow strip of paper meant to represent a sealing charm extending {{from the front of}} the hat and over his face. The developers considered to have the charm able to be knocked off by an opponent's attacks, and as a result alter his attack patterns and power; however, they felt this overcomplicated the character, and instead abandoned the idea. Assistant producer Natsuki Shiozawa cited <b>the</b> <b>outfit</b> as one of her five favorites in the game, feeling that design suited his body well.|$|E

5|$|Guido Forti, after {{discussing}} {{the matter with}} commercial rights-owner Bernie Ecclestone, had decided to withdraw the team from the German GP as negotiations over the team's ownership between himself and Shannon continued, despite {{the threat of the}} FIA (F1's governing body) imposing a fine on <b>the</b> <b>outfit</b> for missing the race. Following the failure of these negotiations, he then announced that Shannon's deal had fallen through and that he was back in charge of the team. He hoped to finalise some more sponsorship deals which would allow Forti to compete in the Hungarian GP. Shannon responded by claiming it still owned 51% of the team, and that it intended to solve Forti's financial problems itself, in addition to replacing Guido Forti as Team Principal. He duly took the company to court over the matter, an arduous process in the Italian legal system.|$|E

The later period of Loxton's tenure was thrown into chaos {{when most of the}} leading players abandoned the existing establishment to sign contracts with the breakaway World Series Cricket—which offered substantially more remuneration—meaning that an almost-entirely new team had to be cobbled together; the 42-year-old Bob Simpson was brought out of a decade of retirement to lead <b>the</b> <b>outfit.</b> During this time, Australia's depleted team suffered many heavy defeats.|$|E
