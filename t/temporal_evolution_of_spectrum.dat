Previous identification of RBEs was mainly based on feature detection using Dopplergrams. In this paper, we study RBEs on 2011 October 21 in a very quiet region at the disk center, which were observed with the high-cadence imaging spectroscopy of the Ca II 8542 A line from the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer (IBIS). By using an automatic spectral analysis algorithm, a total of 98 RBEs are identified during a 11 minute period. Most of these RBEs have either a round or elongated shape, with an average area of 1. 2 arcsec^ 2. The detailed <b>temporal</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>spectra</b> from IBIS makes possible a quantitative determination of the velocity (~ 16 km/s) and acceleration (~ 400 m/s^ 2) of Ca II 8542 RBEs, and reveal an additional deceleration (~- 160 m/s^ 2) phase that usually follows the initial acceleration. In addition, we also investigate the association of RBEs with the concomitant photospheric magnetic field evolution, using coordinated high-resolution and high-sensitivity magnetograms made by Hinode. Clear examples are found where RBEs appear {{to be associated with the}} preceding magnetic flux emergence and/or the subsequent flux cancellation. However, a further analysis with the aid of the Southwest Automatic Magnetic Identification Suite does not yield a significant statistical association between these RBEs and magnetic field evolution.

40|$|Radiation {{brightness}} and impurity behaviors {{have been studied}} for reheat mode discharges in the Compact Helical System (CHS) by three different types of impurity diagnostics. Total radiation power measured by a pyroelectric detector significantly reduces after entering the reheat mode, whereas the line-averaged radiation brightness measured by an absolute extreme ultraviolet (AXUV) photodiode array increases especially for a center viewing chord due to the impurity accumulation in the plasma core. One possible reason for this opposite behavior between the two bolometric detectors is the reduced sensitivity of the AXUV photodiode for lower energy photons in vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region. This speculation is supported by <b>temporal</b> <b>evolutions</b> <b>of</b> VUV <b>spectra</b> measured by a grazing incidence spectrometer.

40|$|The TeV blazar PKS 2155 - 304 was {{monitored}} {{with the}} X-ray satellite ASCA in 1994 May, {{as part of}} a multiwavelength campaign from the radio to X-ray bands. At the beginning of the two-day continuous observation, we detected a large flare, where the 2 - 10 keV flux changed by a factor of 2 on a time scale of 3 x 10 ^ 4 sec. During the flare, the increase in the hard X-ray flux clearly preceded that observed in the soft X-rays, the spectral evolution tracking a `clockwise loop' in the flux versus photon index plane. Ascribing the energy-dependent variability to differential synchrotron cooling of relativistic electrons, we estimate the magnetic field B in the emission region. We tested two different methods of comparing the time series in various X-ray bands: (i) fitting the light curves to a Gaussian and searching for the time shift of the peak of the flare, and (ii) calculating the discrete correlation function. Both methods yielded a consistent solution of B ~ 0. 1 G. We also found that the flare amplitude becomes larger as the photon energy increases, while the duration of the flare stays roughly constant through the ASCA energy band (0. 7 - 7. 5 keV). In the framework of the time dependent synchrotron self-Compton model in a homogeneous region, we consider a flare where the maximum Lorentz factor (Gmax) of the injected electrons increases uniformly throughout the emission volume. The <b>temporal</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>spectra</b> as well as the light curves were reproduced with the physical parameters self-consistently determined from seven observables.

Additionally, dispersive vibrational lines appear at the locations of the ground-state vibrational frequencies and decay with a 260 -fs time constant.

40|$|RHESSI {{observations}} {{are used to}} quantitatively study the hard X-ray evolution in 5 large solar flares selected for spectral hardening {{in the course of}} the event. The X-ray bremsstrahlung emission from non-thermal electrons is characterized by two spectroscopically distinct phases: impulsive and gradual. The impulsive phase usually consists of several emission spikes following a soft-hard-soft spectral pattern, whereas the gradual stage manifests itself as spectral hardening while the flux slowly decreases. Both the soft-hard-soft (impulsive) phase and the hardening (gradual) phase are well described by piecewise linear dependence of the photon spectral index on the logarithm of the hard X-ray flux. The different linear parts of this relation correspond to different rise and decay phases of emission spikes. The <b>temporal</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>spectra</b> is compared with the configuration and motion of the hard X-ray sources in RHESSI images. These observations reveal that the two stages of electron acceleration causing these two different behaviors are closely related in space and time. The transition between the impulsive and gradual phase is found to be smooth and progressive rather than abrupt. This suggests that they arise because of a slow change in a common accelerator rather than being caused by two independent and distinct acceleration processes. We propose that the hardening during the decay phase is caused by continuing particle acceleration with longer trapping in the accelerator before escape. Comment: accepted by Ap...|$|R

On Io, such low-spatial-resolution data are used to classify eruption styles (modes of emplacement) by means of several criteria related to the <b>temporal</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> the infrared <b>spectrum</b> associated with the eruptive activity at each hot spot, which we term "thermal signature. " We find that {{the ratio of the}} emission at 2 and 5 µm, and how this ratio changes with time, is often diagnostic of eruption style, even in low-spatial-resolution data. Tests using thermal data for terrestrial "ground truth" cases show that our classification system is valid on Earth. The results of our analysis can be used to aid in the design of future space-based instruments {{that can be used for}} volcano monitoring on Io, as well as Earth...|$|R
