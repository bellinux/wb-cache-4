5|$|Atomic clocks are {{the most}} {{accurate}} <b>timekeeping</b> devices in practical use today. Accurate to within a few seconds over many thousands of years, {{they are used to}} calibrate other clocks and <b>timekeeping</b> instruments.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary Muslim astronomers also {{constructed}} {{a variety of}} highly accurate astronomical clocks for use in their mosques and observatories, such as the water-powered astronomical clock by Al-Jazari in 1206, and the astrolabic clock by Ibn al-Shatir in the early 14th century. The most sophisticated <b>timekeeping</b> astrolabes were the geared astrolabe mechanisms designed by Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī in the 11th century and by Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr in the 13th century. These devices functioned as <b>timekeeping</b> devices and also as calendars.|$|E
5|$|Atomic clocks are {{far more}} {{accurate}} than any previous <b>timekeeping</b> device, and are used to calibrate other clocks and to calculate the International Atomic Time; a standardized civil system, Coordinated Universal Time, is based on atomic time.|$|E
5|$|DST clock shifts {{sometimes}} complicate <b>timekeeping</b> and can disrupt travel, billing, record keeping, medical devices, heavy equipment, {{and sleep}} patterns. Computer software often adjusts clocks automatically, but policy changes by various jurisdictions of DST dates and timings may be confusing.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} on this theme were oil-lamp clocks. These early <b>timekeeping</b> devices {{consisted of a}} graduated glass reservoir to hold oil — usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and evenly — supplying the fuel for a built-in lamp. As the level in the reservoir dropped, it provided a rough measure of the passage of time.|$|E
5|$|Many ancient civilizations {{observed}} astronomical bodies, {{often the}} Sun and Moon, to determine times, dates, and seasons. The first calendars {{may have been}} created during the last glacial period, by hunter-gatherers who employed tools such as sticks and bones to track the phases of the moon or the seasons. Stone circles, such as England's Stonehenge, were built {{in various parts of}} the world, especially in Prehistoric Europe, and are thought to have been used to time and predict seasonal and annual events such as equinoxes or solstices. As those megalithic civilizations left no recorded history, little is known of their calendars or <b>timekeeping</b> methods. Methods of sexagesimal <b>timekeeping,</b> now common in both Western and Eastern societies, are first attested nearly 4,000years ago in Mesopotamia and Egypt. Mesoamericans similarly modified their usual vigesimal counting system when dealing with calendars to produce a 360-day year.|$|E
5|$|The {{implementation}} of decimal time proved an immense task {{and under the}} article 22 {{of the law of}} 18 Germinal, Year III (7 April 1795), the use of decimal time was no longer mandatory, though the Republican Calendar was retained. On 1 January 1806, France reverted to the traditional <b>timekeeping.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{pendulum}} clock {{remained the}} most accurate timekeeper until the 1930s, when quartz oscillators were invented, followed by atomic clocks after World War 2. Although initially limited to laboratories, the development of microelectronics in the 1960s made quartz clocks both compact and cheap to produce, and by the 1980s they became the world's dominant <b>timekeeping</b> technology in both clocks and wristwatches.|$|E
5|$|These {{fears were}} to prove {{justified}} as, during the line's {{first month of}} operation, {{there were a number}} of well-publicised problems ranging from overcrowding resulting in passengers standing for the whole journey to <b>timekeeping</b> difficulties due to excessive dwell times at stations. Furthermore, signalling problems led to disruption on the line nearly a month after opening.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or Fenjaan, in Persia {{reached a}} level of {{accuracy}} comparable to today's standards of <b>timekeeping.</b> The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used <b>timekeeping</b> device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a qanat or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock. Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate {{the length of time}} they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the astronomical}} armillary sphere (representing the {{celestial}} sphere) existed in China since the 1st century BCE, the mathematician and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 CE) provided it with motive power {{by using the}} constant pressure head of an inflow water clock to rotate a waterwheel that acted {{on a set of}} gears. Zhang Heng was also the first {{to address the problem of}} the falling pressure head in the inflow water clock (which gradually slowed the <b>timekeeping)</b> by setting up an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel.|$|E
5|$|Chinese astrology has a close {{relation}} with Chinese philosophy (theory {{of the three}} harmonies: heaven, earth and man) and uses concepts such as yin and yang, the Five phases, the 10 Celestial stems, the 12 Earthly Branches, and shichen (時辰 a form of <b>timekeeping</b> used for religious purposes). The early use of Chinese astrology was mainly confined to political astrology, the observation of unusual phenomena, identification of portents and the selection of auspicious days for events and decisions.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{he joined}} Sunderland, but was linked with a {{move away from}} the club because of alleged <b>timekeeping</b> issues. He joined Queens Park Rangers in January 2009 and was {{released}} {{at the end of the}} 2008–09 season. Miller joined Hibernian at the start of the 2009–10 Scottish Premier League season on a free transfer. He moved to Australian A-League club Perth Glory in 2011 after his contract with Hibernian expired. Miller represents the Republic of Ireland team internationally, making his debut in 2004 against the Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} during Amenhotep I's reign the first water clock was invented. Amenhotep's court {{astronomer}} Amenemheb took credit for creating this device in his tomb biography, although the oldest surviving mechanism {{dates to the}} reign of Amenhotep III. This invention was of great benefit for <b>timekeeping,</b> because the Egyptian hour was not a fixed amount of time, but was measured as 1/12 of the night. When the nights were shorter in the summer, these waterclocks could be adjusted to measure the shorter hours accurately.|$|E
5|$|Technology {{during the}} Tang period was built also upon the {{precedents}} of the past. Advancements in clockworks and <b>timekeeping</b> included the mechanical gear systems of Zhang Heng (78–139) and Ma Jun (fl. 3rd century) gave the Tang engineer, astronomer, and monk Yi Xing (683–727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork escapement mechanism in 725. This was used alongside a clepsydra clock and waterwheel to power a rotating armillary sphere in representation of astronomical observation. Yi Xing's device {{also had a}} mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a striking clock. Yi Xing's astronomical clock and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement. However, {{the most common type}} of public and palace <b>timekeeping</b> device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a steelyard balance that allowed seasonal adjustment in the pressure head of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, clocks {{primarily}} served religious purposes; {{the first}} employed for secular <b>timekeeping</b> emerged around the 15th century. In Dublin, the official measurement of time became a local custom, and by 1466 a public clock stood {{on top of}} the Tholsel (the city court and council chamber). It was {{the first of its kind}} to be clearly recorded in Ireland, and would only have had an hour hand. The increasing lavishness of castles led to the introduction of turret clocks. A 1435 example survives from Leeds castle; its face is decorated with the images of the Crucifixion of Jesus, Mary and St George.|$|E
5|$|Other {{peculiar}} calendars include ancient Greek calendars. These were nominally lunar, {{starting with}} the New Moon. In reality the calendar could pause or skip days with confused citizens inscribing dates by both the civic calendar and ton theoi, by the moon. The lack of any universal calendar for ancient Greece suggests that coordination of panhellenic events such as games or rituals could be difficult and that astronomical symbolism {{may have been used}} as a politically neutral form of <b>timekeeping.</b> Orientation measurements in Greek temples and Byzantine churches have been associated to deity's name day, festivities, and special events.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} set of observations is related to eminently useful practical applications, namely to satellite navigation systems such as the Global Positioning System that are used both for precise positioning and <b>timekeeping.</b> Such systems rely on two sets of atomic clocks: clocks aboard satellites orbiting the Earth, and reference clocks stationed on the Earth's surface. General relativity predicts that these two sets of clocks should tick at slightly different rates, due to their different motions (an effect already predicted by special relativity) and their different positions within the Earth's gravitational field. In order to ensure the system's accuracy, the satellite clocks are either slowed down by a relativistic factor, or that same factor is made part of the evaluation algorithm. In turn, tests of the system's accuracy (especially the very thorough measurements {{that are part of}} the definition of universal coordinated time) are testament to the validity of the relativistic predictions.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or clepsydrae, were {{commonly}} used in Ancient Greece following their introduction by Plato, who also invented a water-based alarm clock. One account of Plato's alarm clock describes it as depending on the nightly overflow of a vessel containing lead balls, which floated in a columnar vat. The vat held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough to tip over, causing the lead balls to cascade onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the Academy. Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a siphon. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar. There, the rising water would force air through a whistle, sounding an alarm. The Greeks and Chaldeans regularly maintained <b>timekeeping</b> records as {{an essential part of}} their astronomical observations.|$|E
5|$|Webber took {{provisional}} {{pole position}} in Friday qualifying of the , out-qualifying local driver Rubens Barrichello by 0.138 seconds during a rain-affected session. He continued his good {{performance in the}} Saturday session taking a career-best 3rd on the grid, Jaguar Racing's best qualifying performance in their four-year Formula One history. In the race, which was hit heavily by rain, Webber was in seventh place when he attempted to cool his tyres by driving through a puddle lying off-line in the final corner. The resultant lack of grip caused Webber to crash heavily into the pit straight walls, leaving debris on the track which caused a second major crash; Fernando Alonso hitting a stray tyre. The race was subsequently red-flagged, and although Webber was originally classified in 7th, an FIA investigation found a <b>timekeeping</b> error which meant that Webber was placed 9th in the re-classification.|$|E
5|$|Wright met Darwin in {{the early}} 1760s, {{probably}} through their common connection of John Whitehurst, first consulting Darwin about ill health in 1767 when {{he stayed in the}} Darwin household for a week. The energy and vivacity of both Erasmus and Mary (Polly) Darwin impressed Wright. In the 1980s Eric Evans (National Gallery) suggested that Darwin is the figure in the left foreground who holds a watch. As this composed timekeeper is not consistent with Darwin's flamboyant character, {{it is more likely that}} this is Dr William Small. The attention to <b>timekeeping</b> fits with Dr Small's role as the social secretary for the Lunar circle. Small returned from Virginia in 1764 and established his practice in Birmingham in 1765, consistent with this being a meeting in 1767. The profile and wig of this figure are consistent with a contemporary portrait of Small by Tilly Kettle.|$|E
5|$|Although accurate, shadow clocks {{relied on}} the sun, and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather. The Egyptians {{therefore}} developed a number of alternative <b>timekeeping</b> instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor. There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings {{on the side of}} the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them. The oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of pharaoh Amenhotep I (1525–1504), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt. Another Egyptian method of determining the time during the night was using plumb-lines called merkhets. In use since at least 600, two of these instruments were aligned with Polaris, the north pole star, to create a north–south meridian. The time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the merkhets.|$|E
25|$|Hourglass – Hourglasses {{were used}} on Somali ships for <b>timekeeping.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hooke made tremendously {{important}} {{contributions to the}} science of <b>timekeeping,</b> being intimately involved in the advances of his time; {{the introduction of the}} pendulum as a better regulator for clocks, the balance spring to improve the <b>timekeeping</b> of watches, and the proposal that a precise timekeeper could be used to find the longitude at sea.|$|E
25|$|The race's {{organizers}} keep {{a standard}} time clock for all entries, though official <b>timekeeping</b> ceases after the six-hour mark.|$|E
25|$|In 1873 the Japanese {{government}} adopted Western style <b>timekeeping</b> practices, including equal {{hours that}} do not vary with the seasons, and the Gregorian calendar.|$|E
25|$|In his sparetime Rüedi {{was active}} in {{organizing}} and <b>timekeeping</b> the wintertime sledge races which were first and foremost arranged for the entertainment of tourists.|$|E
25|$|Arnold's {{approach}} to precision <b>timekeeping</b> was {{completely different from}} that of Harrison, whose technical ethos was rooted in seventeenth and early eighteenth century theory and practice.|$|E
25|$|The new {{timetables}} {{were fairly}} successful, with adjustments made as the engines proved better <b>timekeeping</b> with lighter loads, {{and as the}} fixed-set policy simplified shunting at Spencer Street station.|$|E
25|$|An {{atomic clock}} uses an atomic {{resonance}} frequency standard as its <b>timekeeping</b> element. The first atomic clock was an ammonia maser device built in 1949 at the United States National Bureau of Standards.|$|E
25|$|In 1858 Sydney Observatory {{was built}} near the signal station. For over a Century it played an {{essential}} role in shipping, navigation, meteorology and <b>timekeeping</b> and astronomy. Today the building is used as museum and public observatory.|$|E
25|$|Much {{of early}} Chinese {{astronomy}} {{was for the}} purpose of <b>timekeeping.</b> The Chinese used a lunisolar calendar, but because the cycles of the Sun and the Moon are different, astronomers often prepared new calendars and made observations for that purpose.|$|E
25|$|These are high-precision <b>timekeeping</b> {{devices such}} as atomic (cesium, rubidium) clocks, GPS clocks or other radio clocks. They {{generate}} a very accurate pulse per second signal that triggers an interrupt and timestamp on a connected computer. Stratum 0 devices are also known as reference clocks.|$|E
25|$|Senior inter-county matches last 70 minutes (35 {{minutes per}} half). All other matches last 60 minutes (30 minutes per half). For teams Under-13 and lower, games may be {{shortened}} to 50 minutes. <b>Timekeeping</b> {{is at the}} discretion of the referee who adds on stoppage time {{at the end of each}} half.|$|E
25|$|While the Byzantine Empire {{still held}} {{learning}} centers such as Constantinople, Western Europe's knowledge was concentrated in monasteries until {{the development of}} medieval universities in the 12th and 13th centuries. The curriculum of monastic schools included {{the study of the}} few available ancient texts and of new works on practical subjects like medicine and <b>timekeeping.</b>|$|E
25|$|In August 2008 it was {{announced}} that a number of speed limits on the relief lines between Reading and London have been raised so that 86% of the line can be used at , however the time allowed between stations for trains running on the relief lines has been reduced in the December 2008 timetable to improve <b>timekeeping.</b>|$|E
