5|$|The {{character}} {{has said he}} was regularly beaten up in high school, {{and by the time}} he left for college he was determined never <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> again. As such, on the first day of his freshman year he walked into class and punched the first person he saw (unfortunately, this happened to be his ethics professor). He attended Dartmouth College (instead of his first pick, Hogwarts, claiming that his white owl led them to reject him), and was a member of the ΣΑΕ fraternity, although his acceptance into the college appears to have been largely influenced by a claimed familial relationship with a wealthy donor, and graduated in the top 47 percent of his class with a major in history. He has also referred to Bob Jones University as an alma mater.|$|E

25|$|The killer's unusual {{attitude}} towards {{the police and the}} media received widespread scrutiny. Psychologists observed that many serial killers gain gratification by eluding pursuers and observers. The feeling of control of media, law enforcement, and even entire populations provides a source of social power for them. After consulting with several psychiatrists, police released a psychological profile of their suspect on May 26, 1977.

Anna served as a victim advocate with the Collier County Sheriff’s Office and an outreach coordinator for the Immokalee Shelter for Abused Women in Collier County, Florida for 10 years. Her first human trafficking case developed from a “home visitation”, in where she was following up on a domestic violence incident.

Anna identified “red flags” that made her suspicious and eventually she helped get the victim out. Today the Tecum case has become a major case study by agencies including USDOJ, FSU, Croft Institute for International and New York Times. The Tecum case was one of the cases used to urge US Congress in passing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.|$|E

According to the backstory in the film Saw IV, John encountered a series of events, including the loss of his unborn child, his diagnosis of an inoperable frontal lobe tumor, his divorce from his wife, and a failed suicide attempt that caused him to begin testing other people's will to live. These tests, which ironically killed many of his victims, {{and the fact that he}} symbolically carved a puzzle piece out of the flesh of his victims, soon earned him the alias [...] "The Jigsaw Killer" [...] from newspaper reporter Oswald McGullicuty.

500|$|On 28 January 1942, FBI agents {{arrived at}} Townsend's home and arrested him for having {{acted as a}} Japanese agent without {{registering}} under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938. A federal investigation into Japanese propaganda which had begun in November 1941 discovered that Townsend had received payments from the Japanese Committee on Trade and Information, a Japanese propaganda organization which had existed between 1937 and 1940. Though Townsend denied being a paid Japanese agent and claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of political persecution, he did admit to having accepting money from the Committee, stating that it was merely a payment {{in exchange for the}} bulk sale of his pamphlets. Even so, Townsend opted to plead guilty on 27 March and argued for a lenient sentence on the grounds that he was not aware that his acts were illegal. Townsend also solicited the support of anti-interventionist politicians and he was sent favorable character references by both former Senator Rush D. Holt and his longtime friend Senator Gerald Nye, the latter of whom described Townsend as [...] "a loyal and patriotic American citizen". The presiding justice T. Alan Goldsborough was, however, unmoved, and deeming his crimes [...] "repulsive, obscene and macabre", Townsend was sentenced on 12 June to between 8 and 24 months in prison and was incarcerated in Washington DC.|$|E

Later that month, during the commemoration of the Jayuya Uprising, the group published a draft notice where they claimed that it was [...] "not just another political-military organization", but [...] "a military structure being formed" [...] and warned that they intended to act [...] "in military fashion [...] guided by the laws of war". Noting their willingness to take their conflict [...] "to the final consequences, the group emphasized that it was [...] "not playing war". Directly identifying the United States [...] "and its collaborators" [...] as their enemy, the EBP stated that [...] "despite treating the public with the upmost responsibility", their sworn enemy would be subjected to trial and if necessary executed. After further distancing themselves from the modus operandi other revolutionary movement, the organization urged potential draftees to [...] "earn physical conditioning" [...] and opened the door to less militant individuals to take a place within their combat units.|$|E
