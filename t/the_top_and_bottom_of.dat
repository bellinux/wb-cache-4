5|$|A 1920s {{adaptation}} {{created by}} the Stempel Type Foundry and released for hot metal typesetting by Linotype, that has remained popular. It is sharp, somewhat angular design with a crisp hook rather than a teardrop at top left of the 'a'. Stempel Garamond has relatively short descenders, allowing it to be particularly tightly linespaced. An unusual feature is the digit 0, which has reversed contrast, with the thickest points of the number on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the digit {{to make it more}} distinguishable from a 'o'. The Klingspor Museum credits it to Stempel's head of typeface development Dr. Rudolf Wolf.|$|E

The banners at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the logo are inspired by the state flag of North Carolina.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As for the {{impinging}} jets {{of single}} group slot nozzles, the heat transfer of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> strip surface is uneven which is {{mainly caused by}} the various jet distances of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> nozzle to <b>the</b> strip surface {{and the effect of}} gravity. In this study, the convective heat transfer process of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> strip surface due to single group slot nozzles in the ultra-fast cooling (UFC) system was studied by the fluid-structure interaction finite element method. The distributions of the flow field and heat transfer for <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> strip surfaces were obtained under the various parameters. The results showed that, the difference value of the average Nusselt numbe for <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> strip surface was decreased with the increase of the jet velocity, but when the jet velocity was up to 5 m/s it remained almost the same. The uniformity of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> surface was improved by the jet impingement height (h) for the h < 45 mm. It was found that for h = 25 mm, the heat transfers of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> down surfaces were more evenly, and the different value of average Nusselt number for the decreased by about 12. 6 %- 28 % as the jet impingement height increased from 25 mm to 45 mm when the slot width was 5 mm...|$|R

5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating {{about the dangers of}} shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E
5|$|Families {{throughout}} Han China made ritual sacrifices {{of animals}} and food to deities, spirits, and ancestors at temples and shrines, {{in the belief that}} these items could be utilized by those in the spiritual realm. It was thought that each person had a two-part soul: the spirit-soul (hun 魂) which journeyed to the afterlife paradise of immortals (xian), and the body-soul (po 魄) which remained in its grave or tomb on earth and was only reunited with the spirit-soul through a ritual ceremony. These tombs were commonly adorned with uniquely decorated hollow clay tiles that function also as a doorjamb to the tomb. Otherwise known as tomb tiles, these artifacts feature holes in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the tile allowing it to pivot. Similar tiles have been found in the Chengdu area of Sichuan province in south-central China.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, with Ken Bates now {{owner of}} the club, Chelsea's crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise and because the old rampant lion badge could not be trademarked. The new badge {{featured}} a more naturalistic non-heraldic lion, in white and not blue, standing over the C.F.C. initials. This lasted for the next 19 years, with some modifications {{such as the use}} of different colours, including red from 1987 to 1995, and yellow from 1995 until 1999, before the white returned. With the new ownership of Roman Abramovich, and the club's centenary approaching, combined with demands from fans for the popular 1950s badge to be restored, it was decided that the crest should be changed again in 2005. The new crest was officially adopted for the start of the 2005–06 season and marked a return to the older design, used from 1953 to 1986, featuring a blue heraldic lion holding a staff. For the centenary season this was accompanied by the words '100 YEARS' and 'CENTENARY 2005–2006' on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the crest respectively.|$|E

5|$|Variations of this flag {{were used}} during the Belarusian People's Republic in 1918–1919. The white-red-white flag is still used by the Republic's government-in-exile. Lasting from 1919 until 1925, {{the flag of the}} BPR {{retained}} the white, red, white design, but with the addition of black stripes at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the red stripe. Between 1921 and 1939 the white-red-white flag was used by the Belarusian national movement in West Belarus (part of the Second Polish Republic), both by political organizations like the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union or the Belarusian Christian Democracy, and non-political organizations like the Belarusian Schools Society. The flag was also used by the Belarusian Special Battalion in the army of the Republic of Lithuania. After the invasion of Poland and the annexation of modern-day West Belarus in 1939 the flag was forbidden by the Soviet administration in the newly acquired territories as well.|$|E

25|$|To make a 35mm print (the {{type of film}} stock most smaller theaters could project), a 35mm print {{with black}} borders along <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> each frame was used.

Because the film could be adapted to the {{requirements}} of individual theaters, movie houses did not need to install special, expensive 70mm projection equipment. This allowed more theaters to show the film. Six of the 70mm lenses, each worth $100,000, were shipped to Rome for use by the production.|$|E
