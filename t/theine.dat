Half-minims were placed, in each case; on the discs of at least six leaves, but no inflection was caused, except perhaps a very slight amount by the <b>theine.</b> Half-minims of a strong infusion of tea likewise produced, as formerly stated, no effect. I also tried similar drops of an infusion of {{one part of the}} extract of colchicum, sold by druggists, to 218 of water; and the leaves were observed for 48 hrs., without any effect being produced. The seven leaves on which drops of veratrine had been left for 26 hrs. were given bits of meat, and after 21 hrs. were well inflected. These three alkaloids are therefore quite innocuous.|$|E
6000|$|As to Moral Regeneration, {{that was}} mainly ensured by the Act for the Absolute Suppression of the Tea Trade. No man, said the Chancellor, {{had a right}} to endanger the health and {{happiness}} of his posterity by the pernicious habit of tea-drinking. Alcohol they had suppressed, and tobacco they had suppressed; but tea still remained a plague-spot in their midst. It had been proved that tea and coffee contained poisonous alkaloid principles, known as <b>theine</b> and caffeine (here the Chancellor displayed the full extent of his chemical learning), which were all but absolutely identical with the poisonous principles of opium, prussic acid, and atheistical literature generally. It might be said that this Bill endangered the liberty of the subject. No man had a greater respect for the liberty of the subject than he had; he adored, he idolized, he honoured with absolute apotheosis the liberty of the subject; but in what did it consist? Not, assuredly, in the right to imbibe a venomous drug, which polluted the stream of life for future generations, and was more productive of manifold diseases than even vaccination itself. [...] "Tea," [...] cried the orator passionately, raising his voice till the fresh whitewash on the ceiling of the Council Chamber trembled with sympathetic emotion; [...] "Tea, forsooth! Call it rather strychnine! Call it arsenic! Call it the deadly Upas-tree of Java (Antiaris toxicaria, Linnæus)"--what prodigious learning!--"which poisons with its fatal breath whoever ventures to pass beneath its baleful shadow! I see it driving out of the field the harmless chocolate of our forefathers; I see it forcing its way into the earliest meal of morning, and the latest meal of eve. I see it now once more swarming over the Pyrenees from France, with Paris fashions and bad romances, to desecrate the sacred hour of five o'clock with its newfangled presence. The infant in arms finds it rendered palatable to his tender years by the insidious addition of copious milk and sugar; the hallowed reverence of age forgets itself in disgraceful excesses at the refreshment-room of railway stations. This is the ubiquitous pest which distils its venom into every sex and every age! This is the enchanted chalice of the Cathaian Circe which I ask you to repel to-day from the lips of the young, the pure, and the virtuous!" ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this text is to analyze {{the main trends of}} the last 20 years keeping inmind two important characteristics of the Brazilian educational system: selection and stratification by age. All educational systems are divided into cycles that, grosso modo, correspond to age groups. In addition, all educational systems have two main objectives: teaching and selecting. A peculiarity of the Brazilian system is that its main selection mechanism, massive grade repetition, distorts the age profile of its students so that educational cycles no longer correspond to specific ages. For this reason, the text attempts to always look at education from the points of view of both cycles andage groups. After an introduction summarizing the main demographic trend of the last 30 to 20 years, the text analyzes three types of indicator: access represented by netenrollment rates, the impacts of repetition as represented by age-grade distortion, andlearning as represented by the results of standardized testing. The objective is toalways analyze both means and dispersions, due to the strong inequality of ourcountry. The mains conclusions are that, in spite of the important educational achievement that was the universalization of access, the Brazilian educational process still leads to low attainment and achievement in levels as well as to reproduction of <b>theine</b> qualities present in Brazilian society. The text ends with a series of policy challenges that go from universalization of pre-school in urban areas to the adjustment of young adult and higher education supply to their demand. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{a question}} of stability in stochastic and deterministic systems with memory, and involves studying the asymptotic properties of Volterra integro-differential equations. The type of stability that has been established for this class of equations is important {{in a variety of}} real-world problems which involve feedback from the past, and are subject to external random forces. These include modelling endemic diseases, and more particularly the modelling of inefficient financial markets. The <b>theine</b> of the thesis is to subject a dynamical system with memory to increasingly trong and unpredictable external noise. Firstly, a fundamental deterministic Volterra quation is considered. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the solution to approach nontrivial limit are known. A strengthened version of these conditions is shown to be necessary and sufficient for exponential convergence to a nontrivial limit. Next, a Volterra equation with a fading stochastic perturbation is studied. Two types f stochastic convergence are considered: mean square and almost sure convergence. Conditions re found which ensure that the solution converges to a non-equilibrium random imit. Moreover, the rate at which this limit is approached is established. In the mean quare case, necessary and sufficient conditions on the resolvent, kernel and noise are determined o ensure this rate of convergence. In the almost sure case, the same conditions re found to be sufficient; furthermore, it is shown that the conditions on the resolvent and he kernel are necessary. A correspoilding result was also found to hold for a more general lass of weakly singular kernels. As in the deterministic case, necessary and sufficient onditions for the solution to converge exponentially fast to its limit are found. Finally, a stochastic Volterra equation with constant noise intensity is considered. This ives rise to the process analogous to Brownian motion, which has applications to mathematical inance. It can be shown that the increments of the process converge to a stationary tatistical distribution, which is Gaussian distributed. The conditions under which uch convergence can take place are completely characterised. In fact, a solution of a orresponding Volterra equation with infinite memory is shown to have exactly stationary ncrements which match the limiting distributions of the increments of solutions. ...|$|E

Curs 2012 - 2013 Director: Lluís ArasanzBeverages’ {{main purpose}} is to hydrate and refresh our body; it can be drunk alone or in social gatherings. In fact, we {{normally}} ask for refreshing drinks such as carbonated and sugary drinks when we meet our friends or relatives, however, products such as iced tea beverages can also refresh us while taking care of our health and Spain lacks good quality iced tea drinks. /nTea is original from China and according to (Macfarlane and Macfarlane 2004) tea {{it is the second}} most widely consumed beverage worldwide after water. Indeed, it is healthy and it has calming effects, even if it contains caffeine (sometimes called <b>theine).</b> In addition, it is appropriate for fighting against thirst in the Spanish summers. Therefore, my motivation for writing this paper came after feeling a lack of iced tea products in the Spanish market. This is why I believe in the introduction of the original Chinese ready to drink iced tea into our market. /nWe considered Wahaha as the most feasible company because it is the drink leader company in China and it is already selling the product we want to introduce. In addition to it, Wahaha is already considering the entrance in the European market; therefore we are in charge for the Spanish region. At a personal level, the project will give life to the personal goal of introducing a product into our market and {{it will be the first}} occasion to fully apply the knowledge learnt during the undergraduate program. /nIn this paper the idea of importing tea into the Spanish market is going to be studied. Therefore, we will first present the product and company to introduce, then we will analyze the context of the Spanish market and we will deep into the beverage industry. /nFinally, we will develop the entry plan to explain the best way to introduce the tea drink into the specific Spanish market.
