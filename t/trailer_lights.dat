2500|$|Since then, Land Rover have {{produced}} less extravagant special editions. The Defender Black was a 90 or 110 County 4x4 with metallic black paint, leather seats, air con, roll cage and dark-tinted rear windows. One {{of the most}} exciting off-road vehicles ever produced, Defender Silver is equipped with stylish and purposeful extras, inside and out, and was available in three distinct versions - TD5, 90 and 110 Station Wagon and 110 Double Cab Pickup. Designed to be tough. Very tough. It was designed to cope with the roughest off-road terrain. [...] That's why every Defender Silver was fitted with an A-frame protection bar which, while undoubtedly enhancing its rugged looks, offered additional protection {{to the front of the}} vehicle. [...] Lamp guards were fitted front and rear, and a tow pack incorporating an electrics kit not only to power <b>trailer</b> <b>lights,</b> but also additional equipment. The underside was further shielded from harm by the sump guard and air-con and ABS/TC were available as options. [...] The vehicles came of the production line and were then modified by SVO - Special Vehicle Operations. They are comparatively rare, especially the Double Cab Pick Up with its opinion splitting Fiberglass TruckMan Top..|$|E

5000|$|A <b>Trailer</b> <b>light</b> {{converter}} is {{an electrical}} component used for connecting the wiring of a trailer onto a towing vehicle. It is sometimes necessary {{because of the}} legal requirement for <b>trailer</b> <b>lighting.</b> Furthermore, from a technical perspective, it is used for wiring the two vehicles together to power and synchronize their <b>lighting</b> systems. A <b>trailer</b> <b>light</b> converter assists in adapting the differences in voltage {{and the number of}} wires.|$|R

50|$|Most basic {{trailers}} in Canada and USA {{usually have}} only one light (with one wire) on each side that functions as both a turn signal and a brake light (though sometimes there is a separate yellow and red light for signal and brake lighting).

5000|$|A {{light tower}} {{is a piece}} of mobile {{equipment}} which has one or more high-intensity electric lamps and a mast. Almost always, the lights are attached to the mast, which is attached to a trailer, with a generator set to power the lamps. Normally the lamps are metal halide bulbs and the generator is powered by a diesel engine. However, battery-powered, solar-powered and hydrogen-powered sets are available; light towers with electrodeless lamps lighting are also sold. Modular kits permit separation of the generator set, <b>trailer,</b> <b>lights</b> and mast from each other. Another variation is an inflatable mast. Particularly when an inflatable mast is used, the lights may be placed close to the ground, with a reflector attached to the mast. When soft lighting is wanted, an inflatable [...] "balloon" [...] diffuser may be used. An inflatable mast may serve as a diffuser.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{deals with}} the {{optimization}} of Robot-Obstacle interaction computations, {{in the context of}} nonholonomic trajectory deformation for mobile robots. We first recall the principle of the trajectory deformation {{and the role of the}} potential field gradient in the configuration space. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First we show that the potential field gradient can be computed without any closed-form expression of the potential function if this latter depends only on the distance between the robot and the obstacles. Then an algorithm to filter obstacles that have no influence in Robot-Obstacle interactions is presented. This algorithm takes advantage of the spatial coherence of the planned trajectory, and has been evaluated by experiments on mobile robot Hilare 2 towing a trailer. Fig. 1. Application of the trajectory deformation method to the mobile robot Hilare 2 towing a <b>trailer.</b> <b>light</b> dots are obstacles detected by a laser scanner. The robot is at the beginning of the planned trajectory on the left. The trajectory is deformed in such a way that it avoids obstacles, the kinematic constraints keep satisfied and the trajectory starts and end at the same configurations before and after deformation.
