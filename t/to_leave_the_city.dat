5|$|This was {{increasingly}} resented by Mírzá Yahyá, who {{began trying to}} discredit Bahá'u'lláh, thus driving many people away from the religion. Tensions in the community mounted, and in 1854 Bahá'u'lláh decided <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> to pursue a solitary life.|$|E

25|$|Every {{young couple}} {{will be offered}} a dunam of free land to build a home with minimum mortgage. This will {{encourage}} young couples <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities,</b> and also <b>to</b> live {{in an environment of}} air and land, rather than cramped into tiny apartments in high-rise buildings.|$|R
50|$|The {{creation}} of a cultural district implies collaboration between {{the arts and the}} local community. Cultural districts may be seen by local authorities as a way to revitalize the “brownfields” of the urban core: areas of abandoned buildings that encourage businesses and residents <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{significant}} number of non-Jewish Poles also did not trust the Germans and decided not <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Many wounded Home Army soldiers became stranded during the uprising and were simply not able to evacuate in time. For others, the choice to remain resulted from feelings of despair and hopelessness brought {{by the fall of}} the uprising; at least initially, they simply did not have the motivation to leave.|$|E
5|$|After {{ordering}} {{almost all}} civilians <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> in September, Sherman gave instructions that all military and government buildings in Atlanta be burned, although many private homes and shops were burned as well. This was {{to set a}} precedent for future behavior by his armies.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{an attempt}} to thwart the Duke's planned coup d'état, Faber is sent on a mission to get help from outside the city but is arrested as he tries <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Despite being tortured, he refuses to reveal the identities of his co-conspirators. Dorothea goes to Süß to beg for her husband's release but Süß demands that she have sex with him as the price for her husband's freedom. Süß rapes Dorothea, who then escapes and drowns herself. Süß keeps his promise to free Faber who {{subsequently}} discovers his wife's drowned corpse.|$|E
25|$|The Mamluks, led by Baibars, {{eventually}} made good their pledge to cleanse the entire Middle East of the Franks. With {{the fall of}} Antioch (1268), Tripoli (1289), and Acre (1291), those Christians unable <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> were massacred or enslaved and the last traces of Christian rule in the Levant disappeared.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, both Hussein and Arafat {{attended}} the emergency meeting of leaders of Arab countries in Cairo and on 27 September, Hussein {{signed an agreement}} that treated both sides as equals and acknowledged {{the right of the}} Palestinian organizations to operate in Jordan, but which required them <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> and stay in the fronts.|$|R
50|$|The deportations {{were one}} of the markers of the {{beginning}} of the Khmer Rouge rule. They demanded and then forced <b>the</b> people <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> and live in the countryside. Phnom Penh—populated by 2.5 million people —was soon nearly empty. The roads out of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> were clogged with evacuees. Similar evacuations occurred throughout the nation.|$|R
5|$|During September25–26, {{large-scale}} evacuations {{took place}} in response to forecasts suggesting a landfall near New Orleans. More than 1.5million people in New Orleans were advised <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> The nine shelters opened throughout the area were collectively capable of accommodating up to 450,000 people. New Orleans mayor Marc Morial declared a State of Emergency to allow federal assistance into the affected areas during {{the immediate aftermath of}} the hurricane. A curfew was instituted for those who ignored evacuation orders or could not leave the city.|$|E
5|$|Further east, Ibn Battuta {{traveled}} from Southeast Asia to Khanbaliq (Beijing) in China. Although the Muslim leaders there extended him a warm welcome, they advised him <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> soon. A civil war {{had caused the}} Khan to flee the city, and riots were {{becoming more and more}} widespread. Meanwhile, T'aigo Wangsa, a Korean Buddhist monk, traveled to China to receive training under the guidance of Buddhist leader Shih-wu. T'aigo later founded the T'aigo sect of Korean Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, Breckinridge's wife Ann died. Lingering {{sadness and}} {{memories}} of his and Ann's life in Baltimore may have led him <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> and the pastorate he had held for twelve years. He was offered pastorate of the Second Presbyterian Church of Lexington, Kentucky, but instead, accepted the presidency of Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1845 {{against the advice of}} his brothers John and William. A rift between Breckinridge and his brother Cabell's widow and other relatives may help account for this surprising decision. He did not feel he could yet return to his home state.|$|E
50|$|The housing {{situation}} for the teaching staff in the countryside is an important challenge for the whole country. Teachers often refuse <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> for <b>the</b> countryside, since accommodation is basic and in short supply. Long commutes and bad roads can delay teachers, hampering {{the education of the}} pupils. This was a problem for Gando in 2001.|$|R
5000|$|The Viceroy, desperately, tried <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> {{governance}} in <b>the</b> hands at Genoino, who proved {{unable to resist}} demands from the streets. Extremists took over. A second revolution took place in August, which culminated in Genoino's exile and the proclamation of a Neapolitan republic under French protection. The Spanish eventually recovered Naples in April 1648 [...]|$|R
50|$|Many state {{highways}} {{converge on}} <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> New York State Route 3 is an east-west route that begins in Sterling and heads {{north and east}} to Watertown. NY 3 interchanges with I-81 at <b>the</b> <b>city</b> line. NY 3 heads east into Watertown, overlapping with both US 11 and NY 12 through downtown prior <b>to</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast to head through the Adirondacks to Plattsburgh.|$|R
5|$|Initially, {{the living}} {{conditions}} of the Robinsons varied according {{to whether or not}} they had had time to prepare. There were roughly three days between the signing of the capitulation and the deadline for civilians <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> during which those who made the decision to stay could stockpile food and water, and camouflage their hiding places. As time passed, supplies ran out, and many Robinsons had to change their locations for security reasons. The situation soon became equally desperate for all who remained.|$|E
5|$|Now {{with the}} city under Gorgopas' command the {{defenders}} became reinvigorated. The siege was proving more difficult until Flamininus arrived with 4,000 Roman soldiers. With {{the arrival of the}} new soldiers, the allied soldiers were encouraged and began bombarding the city again with their siege engines while the Rhodian and Pergamese fleet continued to put pressure on the Spartans from the sea. The Spartans knew {{that they did not have}} much of a chance of withstanding the renewed allied assault and Gorgopas decided to surrender the city to the Romans under the condition that the garrison was allowed <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> unharmed.|$|E
5|$|On September 6, Mayor Ray Nagin {{ordered a}} forced {{evacuation}} of {{everyone from the}} city who {{was not involved in}} clean up work, citing safety and health concerns. The order was given not only as an attempt to restore law and order, but also out of concern about the hazardous living conditions in the city. Eviction efforts escalated three days later, when door-to-door searches were conducted to advise remaining residents <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Despite this, a number of residents defied the eviction order. While initially lax in enforcing evictions, National Guard troops eventually began to remove residents by force.|$|E

50|$|The state {{legislature}} cut short its September session after {{a dead body}} {{was found on the}} steps of State House. Governor Mifflin became ill and was advised by his doctor <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> <b>The</b> <b>city's</b> banks remained open. But, banking operations were so slowed by the inability of people to pay off notes because of disruptions from the epidemic that banks automatically renewed notes until the epidemic ended.|$|R
5000|$|A further {{controversial}} issue regarding the Ramtha teachings involve the so-called [...] "days to come", which were prophesized earth changes. Instructions reputed as coming from Ramtha {{were given to}} the students, telling them <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities,</b> find a place in the country to grow their own food and become sovereign or self-sufficient. Another instruction was told to students to build underground shelters to protect themselves and their families.|$|R
5|$|Paris {{was finally}} recaptured by Charles VII of France in 1436. When the French king re-entered the city, his enemies in Paris {{fortified}} {{themselves in the}} Bastille; after a siege, they eventually ran out of food, surrendered and were allowed <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> after the payment of a ransom. The castle remained a key Parisian fortress, but was successfully seized by the Burgundians in 1464, when they convinced royal troops to surrender: once taken, this allowed their faction to make a surprise attack into Paris, almost resulting in the capture of the king.|$|E
5|$|Upon arrival, Tom {{sees his}} son Matt asleep and picks him up. He talks to his friend, Anne who tells {{him about his}} son's drawings. Tom is then called by Col. Porter (Dale Dye) for a meeting. There, Porter {{discusses}} his plan <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> and break off into groups. The alien air ships can detect groups of humans over 600 persons so he splits his brigade into smaller groups consisting of 100 fighters and 200 civilians. He puts Weaver {{in charge of the}} 2nd Mass and Tom as his second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|According {{to the new}} strategy, {{the forces}} under Girolamo Ramorino and Tomasz Łubieński were <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> and stay on the right bank of the Vistula, harass the Russian forces under von Rosen and von Rüdiger, capture the river {{crossings}} at Osiek, provide the city with supplies, and force Paskevich to divert some of his forces to fight them. Both forces left the city between 16 and 20 August 1831. Tomasz Łubieński's Corps headed towards Płock, broke the encirclement, and delivered much-needed supplies to Warsaw. His forces also broke the northern line of communications between Paskevich's forces and East Prussia. Girolamo Ramorino's II Corps in Podlasie defeated von Rosen's Corps in several clashes, including the battles of Międzyrzec and Rogoźnica. Ramorino's indecisiveness and disregard for orders allowed the defeated and numerically inferior Russians to retreat towards Brześć Litewski and avoid complete destruction.|$|E

50|$|Maccabi's fans saw Dego {{as one of}} {{the main}} reasons for Maccabi beloved captain Avi Nimni's {{dismissal}} in August 2003, and when Dego's adoptive father, David Tshuva, spoke to the press against Maccabi the fans called Dego <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> rival. After <b>the</b> 2004/05 season, he did that and transferred to Hapoel Tel-Aviv.|$|R
5|$|Interstate 40, the city's major east–west {{thoroughfare}} {{was completed}} entirely through Amarillo in November 1968 across {{the center of}} the city. Previously, U.S. Highway 66 was the major east–west highway through the city, generally following Amarillo Blvd. {{to the north of the}} downtown area and then curving southwest <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> near the Veterans Hospital. A city route (which was an original alignment of US 66 through central and west Amarillo) followed Fillmore south into the downtown area and turned on West 6th through the San Jacinto Heights district which is now home to many antique shops, restaurants and other businesses, passing the Amarillo Country Club and veering onto West 9th Street and Bushland Blvd. before tying into the through route at a traffic circle near the Veterans Hospital.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1940, Governor-General Hans Frank {{issued a}} decree {{requiring}} all Kraków Jews <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> {{within the next}} two weeks. Only those who had jobs directly related to the German war effort would be allowed to stay. Of the 60,000 to 80,000 Jews then living in the city, only 15,000 remained by March 1941. These Jews were then forced to leave their traditional neighbourhood of Kazimierz and relocate to the walled Kraków Ghetto, established in the industrial Podgórze district. Schindler's workers travelled on foot to and from the ghetto each day to their jobs at the factory. Enlargements to the facility in the four years Schindler was in charge included the addition of an outpatient clinic, co-op, kitchen, and dining room for the workers, in addition to expansion of the factory and its related office space.|$|E

War comes to Afghanistan, and Kabul is bombarded by rocket attacks. Tariq's family decides <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> and the emotional farewell between Laila and Tariq culminates with them making love. Laila's family also decides to leave Kabul, but as they are packing a rocket destroys the house, killing her parents and severely injuring Laila. Laila is subsequently taken in by Rasheed and Mariam.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 1950s it was {{becoming}} clear to urban planners that something was seriously wrong with <b>the</b> major <b>cities</b> in <b>the</b> U.S. The rapid increase in automobile ownership in the post-war period was providing citizens with unprecedented mobility, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> for housing in the newly created subdivisions at ever increasing distances. As a result there was a flight of capital from the downtown areas, leading to widespread and rapid urban decay.|$|R
