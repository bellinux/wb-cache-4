5|$|A {{project group}} {{with members of}} the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration have {{proposed}} that instead of rebuilding the Ulriken Tunnel to double track, a new double-track light rail tunnel could be built from the city center to Arna.

Several politicians, including <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> Hordaland County Council, have stated {{that in the long run}} they want the light rail line extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppestø.|$|E

5|$|Termites {{are often}} {{compared}} with the social Hymenoptera (ants and various species of bees and wasps), but their differing evolutionary origins result in major differences in life cycle.

In contrast, worker termites, which constitute <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> a colony, are diploid individuals of both sexes and develop from fertilised eggs. Depending on species, male and female workers may have different roles in a termite colony.|$|E
