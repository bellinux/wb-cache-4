5|$|Because it {{displays}} features {{common to}} both birds and non-avian dinosaurs, Archaeopteryx {{has often been}} considered a link between them. In the 1970s, John Ostrom, following Thomas Henry Huxley's lead in 1868, argued that birds evolved within <b>theropod</b> dinosaurs and Archaeopteryx was a critical piece of evidence for this argument; it had several avian features, such as a wishbone, flight feathers, wings, and a partially reversed first toe along with dinosaur and <b>theropod</b> features. For instance, it has a long ascending process of the ankle bone, interdental plates, an obturator process of the ischium, and long chevrons in the tail. In particular, Ostrom found that Archaeopteryx was remarkably similar to the <b>theropod</b> family Dromaeosauridae.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the {{classification}} of Herrerasaurus was unclear because it was known from very fragmentary remains. It was hypothesized to be a basal <b>theropod,</b> a basal sauropodomorph, a basal saurischian, or not a dinosaur at all but another type of archosaur. However, {{with the discovery of}} an almost complete skeleton and skull in 1988, Herrerasaurus has been classified as either an early <b>theropod</b> or an early saurischian in at least five recent reviews of <b>theropod</b> evolution, with many researchers treating it at least tentatively as the most primitive member of Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus was {{the most}} common large <b>theropod</b> in the vast tract of Western American fossil-bearing rock known as the Morrison Formation, {{accounting}} for 70 to 75% of <b>theropod</b> specimens, and as such was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum.|$|E
50|$|A 2017 {{paper has}} put <b>theropods</b> in a {{proposed}} clade Ornithoscelida, {{along with the}} Ornithischia. In this picture, there would be convergent evolution of the hips between some <b>theropods</b> and saurischians.|$|R
5|$|Scientists have {{suggested}} that the unique skull shape of Majungasaurus and other abelisaurids indicate different predatory habits than other <b>theropods.</b> Whereas most <b>theropods</b> were characterized by long, low skulls of narrow width, abelisaurid skulls were taller and wider, and often shorter in length as well. The narrow skulls of other <b>theropods</b> were well equipped to withstand the vertical stress of a powerful bite, but not as good at withstanding torsion (twisting). In comparison to modern mammalian predators, most <b>theropods</b> may have used a strategy similar in some ways to that of long- and narrow-snouted canids, with the delivery of many bites weakening the prey animal.|$|R
50|$|Other large <b>theropods</b> were Giganotosaurus carolinii, and Tyrannosaurus rex, whose largest {{specimens}} known {{estimated at}} 13.2 m and 12.3 m in length respectively. Some other notable giant <b>theropods</b> (e.g. Carcharodontosaurus, Acrocanthosaurus, and Mapusaurus) {{may also have}} rivaled them in size.|$|R
5|$|As {{the archetypal}} <b>theropod,</b> Tyrannosaurus {{is one of}} the best-known dinosaurs since the 20th century, and has been {{featured}} in film, advertising, and postal stamps, as well as many other types of media.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on fossil}} and {{biological}} evidence, most scientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of <b>theropod</b> dinosaurs, and more specifically, they {{are members of}} Maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurs and oviraptorids, among others. As scientists have discovered more theropods closely related to birds, the previously clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred. Recent discoveries in the Liaoning Province of northeast China, which demonstrate many small <b>theropod</b> feathered dinosaurs, contribute to this ambiguity.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Henry Fairfield Osborn named {{a second}} genus of small <b>theropod</b> from the Morrison Formation, Ornitholestes. This genus {{was based on}} a partial {{skeleton}} from Bone Cabin Quarry, north of Como Bluff. Ornitholestes became intertwined with Coelurus in 1920, when Charles Gilmore, in his influential study of <b>theropod</b> dinosaurs, concluded that the two were synonyms. This was followed in the literature for decades. The two genera were not formally compared, however, nor was there a full accounting of what actually belonged to Coelurus, until John Ostrom's study in 1980.|$|E

The group seems to be composed of one very old adult; eight adults between 17 and 23 years old; seven sub-adults undergoing their rapid growth phases at between 12 and 16 years old; and six juveniles {{between the ages of}} 2 and 11 years, who had not yet reached the growth phase.|$|E

5|$|There {{were three}} general dinosaur faunas {{in the late}} Cretaceous. In the {{northern}} continents of North America and Asia, the major <b>theropods</b> were tyrannosaurids and various types of smaller maniraptoran <b>theropods,</b> with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and pachycephalosaurians. In the southern continents that had made up the now-splitting Gondwana, abelisaurids were the common <b>theropods,</b> and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores. Finally, in Europe, dromaeosaurids, rhabdodontid iguanodontians, nodosaurid ankylosaurians, and titanosaurian sauropods were prevalent. Flowering plants were greatly radiating, with the first grasses appearing {{by the end of}} the Cretaceous. Grinding hadrosaurids and shearing ceratopsians became extremely diverse across North America and Asia. <b>Theropods</b> were also radiating as herbivores or omnivores, with therizinosaurians and ornithomimosaurians becoming common.|$|R
2500|$|Based on the {{proportions}} of related <b>theropods,</b> Daemonosaurus is estimated to have been around 1.5 m (5 feet) long. Other estimates suggest that Daemonosaurus was at best [...] long and weighed [...] at most. The skull of Daemonosaurus differs considerably from all other Triassic <b>theropods.</b> The snout is short and bears large premaxillary and maxillary teeth in the upper jaw. Procumbent teeth project forward from {{the tips of the}} upper and lower jaws, which is highlighted in the species name chauliodis that roughly means [...] "". Daemonosaurus is unique among Triassic <b>theropods</b> because it has an unusually short snout, and all other early <b>theropods</b> had long heads and jaws. Like the coelophysoids, Daemonosaurus has a kink in its upper jaws, between the maxilla and the premaxilla.|$|R
50|$|The first {{confirmed}} non-carnivorous fossil <b>theropods</b> found {{were the}} therizinosaurs, originally known as segnosaurs. First {{thought to be}} prosauropods, these enigmatic dinosaurs were later proven to be highly specialized, herbivorous <b>theropods.</b> Therizinosaurs possessed large abdomens for processing plant food, and small heads with beaks and leaf-shaped teeth. Further study of maniraptoran <b>theropods</b> and their relationships showed that therizinosaurs {{were not the only}} early members of this group to abandon carnivory. Several other lineages of early maniraptors show adaptations for an omnivorous diet, including seed-eating (some troodontids) and insect-eating (many avialans and alvarezsaurs). Oviraptorosaurs, ornithomimosaurs and advanced troodontids were likely omnivorous as well, and some early <b>theropods</b> (such as Masiakasaurus knopfleri and the spinosaurids) appear to have specialized in catching fish.|$|R
5|$|The {{presence}} of Acrocanthosaurus in the Cloverly Formation {{was established in}} 2012 with the description of another partial skeleton, UM20796. This specimen, consisting of parts of two vertebrae, partial pubic bones, a femur, a partial fibula, and fragments, represents a juvenile animal. It came from a bonebed in the Bighorn Basin of north-central Wyoming, and was found near the shoulder blade of a Sauroposeidon. An assortment of other fragmentary <b>theropod</b> remains from the formation may also belong to Acrocanthosaurus, {{which may be the}} only large <b>theropod</b> in the Cloverly Formation.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} several species {{left over from}} the synonymizations of Creosaurus and Labrosaurus with Allosaurus. Creosaurus potens was named by Lull in 1911 for a {{vertebra}} from the Early Cretaceous of Maryland. It is now regarded as a dubious <b>theropod.</b> Labrosaurus stechowi, described in 1920 by Janensch based on isolated Ceratosaurus-like teeth from the Tendaguru beds of Tanzania, Although Donald F. Glut listed it as a species of Allosaurus, it is now considered a dubious ceratosaurian related to Ceratosaurus. L. sulcatus, named by Marsh in 1896 for a Morrison <b>theropod</b> tooth, which like L. stechowi is now regarded as a dubious Ceratosaurus-like ceratosaur.|$|E
5|$|After 1897, {{the search}} for dinosaur fossils {{extended}} to every continent, including Antarctica. The first Antarctic dinosaur to be discovered, the ankylosaurid Antarctopelta oliveroi, was found on James Ross Island in 1986, although it was 1994 before an Antarctic species, the <b>theropod</b> Cryolophosaurus ellioti, was formally named and described in a scientific journal.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{recognized}} as such {{at the time}} of its discovery, Compsognathus is the first <b>theropod</b> dinosaur known from a reasonably complete fossil skeleton. Until the 1990s, it was the smallest known non-avialan dinosaur; earlier it had been incorrectly thought to be the closest relative of Archaeopteryx.|$|E
5|$|Although sauropods {{may have}} been the prey of choice for Majungasaurus, discoveries {{published}} in 2007 detail finds in Madagascar that indicate the presence of other Majungasaurus in their diet. Numerous bones of Majungasaurus have been discovered bearing tooth marks identical to those found on sauropod bones from the same localities. These marks have the same spacing as teeth in Majungasaurus jaws, are of the same size as Majungasaurus teeth, and contain smaller notches consistent with the serrations on those teeth. As Majungasaurus is the only large <b>theropod</b> known from the area, the simplest explanation is that it was feeding on other members of its own species. Suggestions that the Triassic Coelophysis was a cannibal have been recently disproven, leaving Majungasaurus as the only non-avian <b>theropod</b> with confirmed cannibalistic tendencies, although {{there is some evidence that}} cannibalism may have occurred in other species as well.|$|E
5|$|More or less {{contemporary}} dinosaur genera of {{the area}} included Prosaurolophus, Scolosaurus, Hypacrosaurus, Einiosaurus and tyrannosaurids of uncertain classification. As proven by tooth marks, horned dinosaur fossils in the Landslide Butte Field Area had been scavenged by a large <b>theropod</b> predator, which Rogers suggested were Albertosaurus.|$|E

50|$|Mesozoic <b>theropods</b> {{were also}} very diverse {{in terms of}} skin texture and covering. Feathers or feather-like {{structures}} are attested in most lineages of <b>theropods.</b> (See feathered dinosaur). However, outside the coelurosaurs, feathers may have been confined to the young, smaller species, or limited parts of the animal. Many larger <b>theropods</b> had skin covered in small, bumpy scales. In some species, these were interspersed with larger scales with bony cores, or osteoderms. This type of skin is best known in the ceratosaur Carnotaurus, which has been preserved with extensive skin impressions.|$|R
5000|$|A fossilized {{trackway}} in Goslar {{also reveals}} a possible reason behind Europasaurus's extinction. When the trackways were reconstructed through digital modeling, {{it was revealed}} that large <b>theropods</b> of unknown variety had migrated to the island via a land bridge from the mainland when the sea level had dropped. The <b>theropods,</b> estimated to be eight meters or more, would likely have hunted the Europasaurus. The invasion of large <b>theropods</b> would have quickly wiped out the specialized island herbivores, which likely had no defenses against predators as large as or larger than themselves.|$|R
5|$|Now {{recognised}} as {{a member}} of the family Spinosauridae, Baryonyx affinities were obscure when it was discovered. Apart from the type species (B. walkeri), some researchers have suggested that Suchomimus tenerensis belongs in the same genus and that Suchosaurus cultridens is a senior synonym; subsequent authors have kept them separate. Baryonyx was the first <b>theropod</b> dinosaur demonstrated to have been piscivorous (fish-eating), as evidenced by fish scales in the stomach region of the holotype specimen. It may also have been an active predator of larger prey and a scavenger, since it also contained bones of a juvenile Iguanodon. The creature would have caught and processed its prey primarily with its forelimbs and large claws. Baryonyx lived near water bodies, in areas where other <b>theropod,</b> ornithopod, and sauropod dinosaurs have also been found.|$|E
5|$|Recent discoveries have elucidated {{many details}} of its anatomy, {{allowing}} for specialized studies focusing on its brain structure and forelimb function. Acrocanthosaurus {{was the largest}} <b>theropod</b> in its ecosystem and likely an apex predator which preyed on sauropods, ornithopods, and ankylosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Stegosaurus madagascariensis from Madagascar {{is known}} solely from teeth and was {{described}} by Piveteau in 1926. The teeth were variously attributed to a stegosaur, the <b>theropod</b> Majungasaurus, a hadrosaur or even a crocodylian, but is now considered a possible ankylosaur.|$|E
5000|$|Barsbold has had {{considerable}} influence on dinosaur paleontology in the Communist world. Barsbold's scientific work {{has made him}} a leading authority on <b>theropods</b> of the Gobi Desert, starting with his doctoral dissertation on these dinosaurs.
