40|$|International audienceDigital <b>tabletops</b> {{are gaining}} {{increasing}} relevancy within commercial and educational sectors. These devices, with their multi-touch surfaces, can support collaborative activities while maintaining natural face-to-face communication. However, we still {{know little about}} possible learning outcomes and the situations they favor. We have conducted a study to explore how group activities on <b>tabletops</b> could potentially encourage collaboration on <b>tabletops.</b> We have particularly focused on the potential of <b>tabletops</b> to favor knowledge transfer, which can be translated to the question how knowledge might be assimilated, understood and transferred in the best way. This paper presents a comparative study of a learning session using concept-maps on <b>tabletops</b> and a learning session using traditional paper and pencil tools. The comparison revealed a tendency for the tabletop-environment to effectively support knowledge transfer...|$|R

40|$|Fast and {{accurate}} touch detection {{is critical to}} the usability of multi-touch <b>tabletops.</b> In optical <b>tabletops,</b> such as those using the popular FTIR and DI technologies, this requires efficient and effective noise reduction to enhance touches in the camera’s input. Common approaches to noise reduction do not scale to larger tables, leaving designers with a choice between accuracy problems and expensive hardware. In this paper, we present a novel noise reduction algorithm that provides better touch recognition than current alternatives, particularly in noisy environments, without imposing higher computational cost. We empirically compare our algorithm to other noise reduction approaches using data collected from <b>tabletops</b> at research labs in Canada and Europe.

5|$|In 1995, Gygax {{began work}} on a new {{computer}} role-playing game called Lejendary Adventures.

40|$|The {{number and}} types of {{applications}} developed for multi-touch <b>tabletops</b> are dramatically increased in the last years, mainly {{due to the fact}} that interactive <b>tabletops</b> allow a more natural interaction with the user through their multi-touch interfaces.

In this paper we present Tactive, a software layer for fast development of portable applications for multi-touch interactive <b>tabletops.</b> Tactive allows to abstract from hardware and software equipment and to embed a web application into a application for multi-touch surfaces.

5|$|The work {{to develop}} an {{adaptation}} of Shadowrun for the SNES by the Australian developer Beam Software began when Adam Lanceman, part of the company's management team, acquired the license for FASA's 1989 <b>tabletop</b> RPG.

The game's production was halted by Beam, but eventually resumed before its set deadline.|$|E
5|$|Dungeons & Dragons (abbreviated as D or DnD) is {{a fantasy}} <b>tabletop</b> {{role-playing}} game (RPG) originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson.

It was derived from miniature wargames with a variation of Chainmail serving as the initial rule system. D publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: By design, {{interactive}} <b>tabletops</b> and surfaces provide numerous {{opportunities for}} data visualization and analysis. In information visualization, scientific visualization, and visual analytics, useful insights primarily emerge from interactive data exploration. Nevertheless, interaction research in these domains has largely focused on mouse-based interactions in the past, with little {{research on how}} interactive data exploration can benefit from interactive surfaces. These proceedings represent {{the results of the}} DEXIS 2011 Workshop on Data Exploration for Interactive Surfaces. It was held in conjunction with the ACM International Conference on <b>Tabletops</b> and Interactive Surfaces (ITS) in Kobe, Japan on November 13, 2011. The introduction summarizes the published papers of the workshop and points to results from workshop discussions. The remainder of the proceedings is made up of the position papers submitted to the workshop. Key-words: interactive <b>tabletops</b> and surfaces, visualization, data exploratio...|$|R

5|$|During a LARP, player {{actions in}} the real world {{represent}} character actions in an imaginary setting. Game rules, physical symbols and theatrical improvisation are used to bridge differences between the real world and the setting. For example, a rope could signify an imaginary wall. Realistic-looking weapon props and risky physical activity are sometimes discouraged or forbidden for safety reasons. While the fictional timeline in a <b>tabletop</b> RPG often progresses in game-time, which may be much faster or slower than the time passing for players, LARPs are different in that they usually run in real-time, with game-time only being used in special circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Golem Arcana {{was funded}} through a Kickstarter {{campaign}} that launched in September 2013 {{and went on}} to raise over $500,000. The game was released just under a year later, on 13 August 2014. Both studio co-founder Jordan Weisman and executive producer Ray Winninger had extensive experience developing both video games and <b>tabletop</b> games, and one of their primary motivations in creating Golem Arcana was to merge the two gaming types. They also sought to create a more social experience than could be found in traditional multiplayer video games.|$|E
5|$|Participants {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the crew may help the GMs {{to set up and}} maintain the environment of the LARP during play by acting as stagehands or playing non-player characters (NPCs) who fill out the setting. Crew typically receive more information about the setting and more direction from the GMs than players do. In a <b>tabletop</b> role-playing game, a GM usually plays all the NPCs, whereas in a LARP, each NPC is typically played by a separate crew member. Sometimes players are asked to play NPCs for periods of an event.|$|E

They add tactile feedback to multi-touch tables and can be dynamically relabeled with rear projection.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of {{children}} collaborating around interactive <b>tabletops</b> in three different countries: India, the United Kingdom and Finland. Our data highlights the key distinctive physical strategies used by children when performing collaborative tasks during this study. Children in India employ dynamic positioning with frequent physical contact and simultaneous object movement. Children in the UK tend to prefer static positioning with minimal physical contact and simultaneous object movement. Children in Finland use a mixture of dynamic and static positioning with minimal physical contact and object movement. Our findings indicate the importance of understanding collaboration strategies and behaviours when designing and deploying interactive <b>tabletops</b> in heterogeneous educational environments. We conclude with a discussion on how designers of <b>tabletops</b> for schools can provide opportunities for children in different countries to define and shape their own collaboration strategies for small group learning that take into account their different classroom practices...|$|R
5|$|Shadowrun is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game (RPG) that combines the statistical factor {{of the original}} <b>tabletop</b> game (with minor changes) with real-time gameplay. The player is given direct control over the protagonist Jake and moves him around using the directional pad within the game's isometrically displayed world. A cursor system allows the player to scroll a pointer across the screen and perform various actions that include opening doors and passageways, examining and picking up objects, engaging in conversation with non-player characters (NPCs), and utilizing firearms and magic commands while in combat.|$|E
5|$|The first LARPs {{were run}} in the late 1970s, {{inspired}} by <b>tabletop</b> role-playing games and genre fiction. The activity spread internationally during the 1980s and has diversified into {{a wide variety of}} styles. Play may be very game-like or may be more concerned with dramatic or artistic expression. Events can also be designed to achieve educational or political goals. The fictional genres used vary greatly, from realistic modern or historical settings to fantastic or futuristic eras. Production values are sometimes minimal, but can involve elaborate venues and costumes. LARPs range in size from small private events lasting a few hours to large public events with thousands of players lasting for days.|$|E
