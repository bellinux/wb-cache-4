5|$|<b>The</b> <b>iconography</b> of Bhikshatana is {{discussed}} in all Shaiva Agamic texts, including Amshumadbhedagama, Kamikagama, Supredagama, Karanagama and the iconographic work Shilparatna; the texts are mostly South Indian in origin. <b>The</b> <b>iconography</b> is quite {{similar to that of}} the Kankala-murti aspect who, like Bhikshatana, is associated with the legend of Shiva's atonement for severing Brahma's head. The chief difference is that Bhikshatana is nude and Kankala-murti is clothed.|$|E
5|$|The Agamic texts {{like the}} Amsumadbhedagama, the Uttara-kamaikagama and the Purva-Karanagama {{prescribe}} <b>the</b> <b>iconography</b> of the Kalyanasunadara icon.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>iconography</b> of Chinnamasta is {{described}} in the Trishakti Tantra (pre-16th century), the Tantrasara (Prachandachandika section), the Shakta Pramoda (Chinnamastatantra section), and the Mantra-mahodadhih (1589CE).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>iconographies</b> of <b>the</b> yogini {{images in}} four yogini temples are not uniform. In the Hirapur temple, all yogini images are with their vahanas (vehicles) and in {{standing}} posture. In Ranipur-Jharial temple the yogini images are in dancing posture. In Bhedaghat temple, yogini images are seated in Lalitasana.|$|R

5|$|Although the art {{produced}} (particularly pottery, grave stelai and figurines) {{was used}} by {{a wider range of}} people than much Athenian literature was—including women and children—it is not known how accurately <b>the</b> <b>iconography</b> of classical art mapped the reality of classical society.|$|E
5|$|Bacon did {{not return}} to the crucifixion theme until his 1962 Three Studies for a Crucifixion. That {{depiction}} is a far more oblique and less literal utilisation of <b>the</b> <b>iconography</b> of the biblical scene, but a more direct invocation of imagery of the slaughterhouse and slabs of meat.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>iconography</b> of {{the ceiling}} has had various interpretations in the past, some {{elements}} {{of which have been}} contradicted by modern scholarship. Others, such as the identity of the figures in the lunettes and spandrels, continue to defy interpretation. Modern scholars have sought, as yet unsuccessfully, to determine a written source of the theological program {{of the ceiling}} and have questioned {{whether or not it was}} entirely devised by the artist himself, who was both an avid reader of the Bible and a genius. Also of interest to some modern scholars is the question of how Michelangelo's own spiritual and psychological state is reflected in <b>the</b> <b>iconography</b> and the expression of the ceiling. One such speculation is that Michelangelo was tormented by conflict between homosexual desires and passionate Christian beliefs.|$|E
40|$|The {{different}} {{expressions of}} memory and identity evident in the tombstones of nineteenth-century Irish migrants in the Stawell general cemetery in western Victoria are presented with examples. The manner in which <b>the</b> <b>iconographies</b> and words inscribed on the tombstones highlight the social status, religious affiliation and affinity for the Irish homeland of the deceased is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Much of Keck's writing oscillates between absurdist {{comedy that}} centers around altered states of {{consciousness}} and sexuality and serious reflections on religious themes. His most recent books suggest an association with Discordianism as the cover art displays many of <b>the</b> <b>iconographies</b> of Discordian beliefs, such as the Sacred Chao, and direct reference to the Greek goddess Eris.|$|R

5|$|The scholar van Kooij {{notes that}} <b>the</b> <b>iconography</b> of Chhinnamasta has the {{elements}} of heroism (vira rasa) and terror (bhayanaka rasa) as well as eroticism (sringara rasa) {{in terms of the}} copulating couple, with the main motifs being the offering of her own severed head, the spilling and drinking of blood, and the trampling of the couple.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{model for}} <b>the</b> <b>iconography</b> of Saint Jovan Vladimir is an engraving in the 1690 {{edition of the}} Greek akolouthia. It is a work by Venetian engraver Isabella Piccini. She depicted the saint with a mustache and short beard, wearing a cloak and a crown inscribed with lilies, holding a cross in his right hand, and his severed head in his left hand. A portable icon in Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, dated around 1700, shows the saint mounted on horseback.|$|E
5|$|Another {{representation}} of Kamadhenu shows {{her with the}} body of a white Zebu cow, crowned woman's head, colourful eagle wings and a peacock's tail. According to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, this form is influenced by <b>the</b> <b>iconography</b> of the Islamic Buraq, who is portrayed with a horse's body, wings, and a woman's face. Contemporary poster art also portrays Kamadhenu in this form.|$|E

5|$|Cram {{designed}} the chapel {{with the assistance}} of Alexander Hoyle, a member of his firm. Albert M. Friend, a faculty member in Princeton's Department of Art and Archaeology, {{played a central role in}} planning <b>the</b> <b>iconography.</b> It was built by Matthews Construction Company, which worked on several projects on Princeton's campus. Among those who contributed to the design of stained glass windows were Charles Connick, Henry Lee Willet (of the studio that would become Willet Hauser), and Philadelphia-based stained glass artist Nicola d'Ascenzo.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>iconography</b> of Kashmir, {{during the}} 8th and 9th centuries, {{the gods of}} Hindu Trimurti - Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva - each are {{depicted}} with three heads. In a sculpture displayed in the Metropolitan Art Museum of New York, the four-headed Brahma as well as Shiva are shown with three visible heads. Vishnu is depicted as Vaikuntha Chaturmurti in this configuration, with three visible heads.|$|E
5|$|Motifs and {{arrangements}} of figures extend along the lower panels {{from one to}} the next, {{to the extent that the}} separations between panels are ignored with the intersections cutting figures in two. This is particularly evident on the lower register where each panel division intersects figures, so that parts of figures are painted on two adjoining panels; whereas Christ and St Michael are enclosed within the single central panel, giving emphasis to <b>the</b> <b>iconography.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many African female {{diasporic}} {{artists have}} criticized <b>the</b> traditional <b>iconography</b> of Baartman. According to {{the studies of}} contemporary feminists, traditional iconography and historical illustrations of Baartman are effective in revealing the ideological representation of black women in art throughout history. Such studies assess how <b>the</b> traditional <b>iconography</b> of <b>the</b> black female body was institutionally and scientifically defined in the nineteenth century.|$|R
5|$|The codex, {{although}} displaying Mixtec stylistic features, {{is judged}} to be Maya (if genuine) based upon the use of bark paper instead of the deerhide preferred for Mixtec codices {{and because of the}} presence of Maya day signs and numbering. The Mixtec interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>iconography</b> may simply be due to incomplete knowledge of highland Maya iconography during the Postclassic period.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>iconography</b> of {{the eight}} legs and hooves of the horses {{can be used to}} {{identify}} Troilus on pottery where his name does not appear; for example, on a Corinthian vase where Troilus is shooting at his pursuers and on a peaceful scene on a Chalcidian krater where the couples Paris and Helen, Hector and Andromache are labelled, but the youth riding one of a pair of horses is not.|$|E
5|$|The {{preliminary}} matter is introduced by an iconic {{image of the}} Virgin and Child (folio 7v). This miniature is the first representation of the Virgin in a Western manuscript. Mary is shown in an odd mixture of frontal and three-quarter pose. This miniature also bears a stylistic similarity to the carved image on the lid of St. Cuthbert's coffin of 698. <b>The</b> <b>iconography</b> of the miniature may derive from an Eastern or Coptic icon.|$|E

5|$|This work {{excludes}} {{elements of}} several dreamings associated with country further south, {{which had been}} included in the painting created by Clifford Possum and his brother a year earlier. The omission led scholar Vivien Johnson to conclude that Warlugulong (1977) portrays a narrower geographic area than the preceding work. The artist also modified some of <b>the</b> <b>iconography,</b> and limited the explanations of the painting, omitting secret-sacred dimensions of the stories to avoid offending other Indigenous men, and in recognition that most of the audience for the work would be uninitiated non-Indigenous people.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, its {{original}} provenance remains unknown. The relief was not archaeologically excavated, and thus {{we have no}} further information where it came from, or in which context it was discovered. An interpretation of the relief thus relies on stylistic comparisons with other objects for which the date and place of origin have been established, on an analysis of <b>the</b> <b>iconography,</b> and on the interpretation of textual sources from Mesopotamian mythology and religion.|$|E
5|$|A set of {{fourteen}} redesigned Major Arcana tarot cards, {{based on the}} Rider-Waite deck, were commissioned by the singer for the album's artwork. The cards depict band members in surrealistic tableau. Each card was reinterpreted to reflect <b>the</b> <b>iconography</b> of the album's lyrical content: The Fool is stepping off a cliff, with grainy images of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a JFK campaign poster in the background; The Emperor, with prosthetic legs, {{is sitting in a}} wheelchair clutching a rifle in front of an American flag; Justice weighs the Bible against the brain on his balance scale. The album's inner sleeve contains these three images, along with a further nine: The Magician, The High Priestess, The Hierophant, The Hermit, Death, The Devil, The Tower, The Star and The World. The cover itself represents The Hanged Man.|$|E
