25|$|According to Larson and Yao (2005), empathy should {{characterize}} physicians' {{interactions with}} their patients because, despite advancement in medical technology, <b>the</b> <b>interpersonal</b> relationship between physicians and patients remains essential to quality healthcare.

On the other hand, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians engage in surface acting when they fake empathic behaviors toward the patient. Although Larson and Yao (2005) argue that deep acting is preferred, physicians may rely on surface acting when sincere empathy for patients is impossible. Overall, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians are more effective and enjoy more professional satisfaction when they engage in empathy through deep acting due to emotional labor.|$|E
