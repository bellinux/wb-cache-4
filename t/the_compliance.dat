5|$|Any {{mechanical}} component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness. This translates in electrical terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, hence {{mechanical component}}s are resonators {{and are often}} used as such. It is still possible to represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and <b>the</b> <b>compliance</b> is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass in comparison to <b>the</b> <b>compliance</b> of the piece.|$|E

5|$|This section covers {{compliance}} with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA). This act provides for uniform and equitable treatment of persons displaced by a federal programs from their homes, businesses, or farms, including assuring just compensation and assisting in relocation. For example, if {{the construction of a}} highway under a federal program requires the expropriation of homes, the expropriation must be made by either providing fair compensation for that property or providing assistance for, or reimbursement of, relocation expenses incurred by the affected person. <b>The</b> <b>Compliance</b> Supplement suggests verifying that the property acquired is appraised by qualified independent appraisers, the appraisals are examined by a review appraiser to assure acceptability, and that after acceptance, the review appraiser certifies the recommended or approved value of the property for just compensation to the owner.|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{formulae}} {{are given}} for calculation of storage and loss <b>compliance</b> from <b>the</b> course of <b>the</b> creep <b>compliance</b> for linear viscoelastic materials. These formulae involve values of <b>the</b> creep <b>compliance</b> at times which are equally spaced on a logarithmic time scale. The ratio between succeeding times {{corresponds to a}} factor of two. A method is introduced by which bounds for the relative error of those formulae can be derived. These bounds depend {{on the value of}} the damping, tan δ. The calculation of <b>the</b> storage <b>compliance</b> is easier with the lower damping values. This calculation involves the value of <b>the</b> creep <b>compliance</b> at time t 0 = 1 /ω, and that of its derivative with respect to the logarithm of time in a rather narrow region around t 0. In contrast the calculation of <b>the</b> loss <b>compliance</b> is more difficult with the lower damping values.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} the closed-form modeling of an XY flexure-based nano-manipulator developed {{in our previous}} work [28]. In this nano-manipulator, the flexure hinges are arranged in SIS configurations to transmit linear or angular motions. Analytical modeling reveals that <b>the</b> lever’s <b>compliance</b> significantly increases <b>the</b> estimation error. Thus, a threshold is proposed to determine whether <b>the</b> lever’s <b>compliance</b> can be neglected or not. Subsequently, a systematic modeling methodology is established to investigate {{the behavior of the}} nano-manipulator during linear and angular motions. Experimental results show that the modeling accuracy is significantly improved if the influence of <b>the</b> lever’s <b>compliance,</b> <b>the</b> contact stiffness, and the load mass is taken into consideration.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work, we predict {{contribution}} of a partially debonded circular inhomogeneity into the material overall elastic <b>compliance.</b> Debonding at <b>the</b> matrix/inclusion boundary is modeled as interfacial arc cracks. The change in <b>the</b> elastic <b>compliance</b> caused by interface cracking is estimated through the accompanying energy {{change that is}} related to the mode I and mode 11 stress intensity factors at the crack tips. The sum of <b>the</b> crack <b>compliance</b> and <b>the</b> inhomogeneity <b>compliance</b> (with perfect bonding) gives <b>the</b> total <b>compliance</b> of <b>the</b> debonded inhomogeneity. The latter is obtained in terms of the material properties and crack length. Additional analysis shows that the replacement of an interface crack with a crack in a homogenized medium is an inadequate approach when seeking approximate solutions. The paper also provides guidelines how to determine properties of a fictitious perfectly bonded orthotropic inhomogeneity that has the same contribution into <b>the</b> material <b>compliance</b> as <b>the</b> debonded isotropic one. This problem is of practical importance when modeling damage accumulation in composite materials by means of homogenization schemes. status: publishe...|$|R
