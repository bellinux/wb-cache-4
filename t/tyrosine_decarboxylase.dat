40|$|Abstract—Recently it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that catecholamines are produced and used by macrophages and mediate immune response. The {{aim of this study}} is to verify whether endothelial cells (ECs), which are of myeloid origin, can produce catecholamines. We demonstrated that genes coding for <b>tyrosine</b> hydroxylase, Dopa <b>decarboxylase,</b> dopamine hydroxylase (DH), and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase, enzymes involved in the synthesis of catecholamines, are all expressed in basal conditions in bovine aorta ECs, and their expression is enhanced in response to hypoxia. Moreover, hypoxia enhances catecholamine release. To evaluate the signal transduction pathway that regulates catecholamine synthesis in ECs, we overexpressed in bovine aorta ECs either protein kinase A (PKA) or the transcription factor cAMP response element binding, because PKA/cAMP response element binding activation induces tyrosine hydroxylase transcription and activity in response to stress. Both cAMP response element binding and PKA overexpression enhance DH and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase gene expression and catecholamine release, whereas H 89, inhibitor of PKA, exerts the opposite effect, evidencing the role of PKA/cAMP response element binding transduction pathway in the regulation of catecholamine release in bovine aorta ECs. We then evaluated by immunohistochemistry the expression of <b>tyrosine</b> hydroxylase, Dopa <b>decarboxylase,</b> DH, and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase in femoral arteries from hindlimbs of C 57 Bl/ 6 mice 3 days after removal of the common femoral artery to induce chronic ischemia. Ischemia evokes <b>tyrosine</b> hydroxylase, Dopa <b>decarboxylase,</b> DH, and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase expression in the endo-thelium. Finally, the pharmacological inhibition of catecholamine release by fusaric acid, an inhibitor of DH, reduces the ability of ECs to form network-like structures on Matrigel matrix. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that ECs are able to synthesize and release catecholamines in response to ischemia...|$|R

Expression of TDC and TYDC was shown to deplete the levels of Trp and Tyr, respectively, during seedling development. The creation of artificial metabolic sinks for Trp and Tyr also drastically affected the levels of phenylalanine, {{as well as those}} of the non-aromatic amino acids methionine, valine, and leucine. Transgenic seedlings also displayed a root-curling phenotype that directly correlated with the depletion of the Trp pool. Non-transformed control seedlings could be induced to display this phenotype after treatment with inhibitors of auxin translocation such as 2, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoic acid or N- 1 -naphthylphthalamic acid. The depletion of aromatic amino acids was also correlated with increases in the activities of the shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways in older, light-treated transgenic seedlings expressing TDC, TYDC, or both. These results provide in vivo confirmation that aromatic amino acids exert regulatory feedback control over carbon flux through the shikimate pathway, as well as affecting pathways outside of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis...|$|R

In the spontaneously hypertensive rat, the most studied model of essential hypertension, many components of the adrenergic system are altered. Changes in expression level of any catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes or any adrenergic receptor subtypes could be one of the causes of hypertension development. In this work, the expression of adrenergic system genes was measured in adrenal gland, renal cortex and renal medulla of the spontaneously hypertensive (SHR), Wistar-Kyoto and Brown Norway rats at the age of thirteen weeks. In adrenal gland of SHR, all four catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes (<b>tyrosine</b> hydroxylase, DOPA <b>decarboxylase,</b> dopamine β-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine-N- methyltransferase) and almost all subtypes of adrenergic receptors (with the exception of Adra 1 a and Adra 1 d) were underexpressed.

The mechanism of this downregulation in SHR could be a negative feedback through adrenergic receptors stimulated by high plasma noradrenaline concentration.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{disturbance}} in {{the immune system}} has been described in Turner syndrome (45,X), with an association to low levels of IgG and IgM and decreased levels of T- and B-lymphocytes. Also different autoimmune diseases have been connected to Turner syndrome (45,X), thyroiditis being the most common. Other autoimmune diseases seen are inflammatory bowel disease, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, Addison's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, vitiligo, alopecia, pernicious anaemia and hypoparathyroidism, but the association to Turner syndrome is not definite. Besides the typical features of Turner syndrome (short stature, failure to enter puberty spontaneously and infertility due to ovarian insufficiency) ear problems are common. Otitis media and a progressive sensorineural hearing disorder are commonly seen. In the normal population there are known inner ear disorders related to autoimmune diseases. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate patients with Turner syndrome regarding autoantibodies connected to the autoimmune disorders; autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I and II and Addison's disease, to screen for overlapping profile of autoantibodies. Blood samples from 110 Turner patients (7 – 65 years) were investigated using in vitro transcription, translation and immunoprecipitation techniques regarding autoantibodies connected to autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I and II and Addison's disease (21 -hydroxylase, 17 α-hydroxylase, side-chain cleavage enzyme, aromatic L-amino acid <b>decarboxylase,</b> <b>tyrosine</b> hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase).

30|$|Neurotransmitters are {{endogenous}} {{chemicals that}} transmit signals across a synapse from one neuron cell to another target neuron. Fl {{has been well}} documented for its neurotoxic effect mediated through the generation of ROS in cells (Russell, 2004). In the present study, neurotransmitters such as AchE (acetylecholinesterase), norepinephrin (NP), dopamine (DA), and 5 -hydroxytriptamin (5 -HT) were significantly decreased in fluoride-intoxicated rats. Our findings is well corroborated with the previous reports of Flora, Mittal, and Mishra (2009) in Fl-intoxicated rats. This {{may be due to the}} over production of free radicals mediated lipid peroxidation in brain which will affect the synthesis of neurotransmitters. Moreover, the decreased levels of NE and DP due to the decreased activity of enzymes involved in their synthesis like <b>tyrosine</b> hydroxylase, DOPA <b>decarboxylase</b> and dopamine β-hydroxylase or to the enhanced release of catechol-O-methyl transferase caused by increased ROS-mediated lipidperoxidation and nitric oxide activity by Fl (Flora et al., 2009). Similarly, a significant decreased activity of AChE in Fl-exposed animals was reported by Long et al. (2002) in rats. Pre-administration of EGCG significantly improved the altered neurotransmitters in the brain of Fl-intoxicated rats via its enhanced ROS scavenging ability as reported by Kumar and Kumar (2009). Further, the dominant hydrogen-donating activity of EGCG activates the Nrf 2 proteins and increase the phase II antioxidants, thereby preventing the Fl-induced generation of ROS/RNS in the rat brain. Moreover, EGCG has been proved to be a potent antioxidant which inhibited the Fl-mediated Keap 1 proteins and DNA damage; lipid peroxidation in the brain, liver, and kidney of rats; and increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in rats (Kumar & Kumar, 2009; Thangapandiyan & Miltonprabu, 2013; Thangapandiyan & Miltonprabu, 2014).|$|R
40|$|Context: The {{incidence}} of {{type 1 diabetes}} has been increasing over time. Objective: We estimated the genetic and environmental components of type 1 diabetes susceptibility in a twin cohort of recent-onset cases to explore the sources of changing disease epidemiology. Design: We linked the population-based Italian Twin Registry with 14803 type 1 diabetes records from 36 pediatric diabetes care centers throughout Italy, except Sardinia, and identified 173 diabetic twins. Patients were positive {{for at least one}} autoantibody to islet cell, glutamate <b>decarboxylase,</b> <b>tyrosine</b> phosphatase, insulin, or zinc transporter 8 and were insulin dependent since their diagnosis. Zygosity was determined by DNA genotyping or by questionnaire. Outcome Measures: We estimated proband-wise concordance, cotwin recurrence risk with Kaplan-Meier method, and genetic and environmental proportions of susceptibility variance by structural equation models. Results: We recruited 104 diabetic twins (53 males) from 88 pairs (34 monozygotic, 54 dizygotic) and one triplet. The mean age at diagnosis was 8. 1 yr (range 1. 1 - 20. 5 yr), and the median year of diagnosis was 2002. Proband-wise concordances were 45. 5 and 16. 4 % in monozygotic and dizygotic pairs (P = 0. 01). Recurrence risks in monozygotic and dizygotic cotwins were 37 and 12 % after 10 yr from the proband's diagnosis (P = 0. 005). Genetic contribution to type 1 diabetes susceptibility was 40 % (95 % confidence interval 8 - 78), and the shared and individual-specific environmental components were 51 % (14 - 77) and 9 % (4 - 19), respectively. Conclusions: In addition to the moderate genetic effects on type 1 diabetes susceptibility, our results draw attention to the substantial shared environmental effects, suggesting that exposures in fetal or early postnatal life may contribute to the increasing {{incidence of}} the disease.

40|$|The dawn of {{chemical}} neuroanatomy in the CNS {{came with the}} discovery and mapping of the central dopamine, noradrenaline and 5 -hydroxytryptamine neurons by means of transmitter histochemistry using the Falck-Hillarp formaldehyde fluorescence technique in the early 1960 s. Our mapping of the central monoamine neurons was continued and further established with <b>tyrosine</b> hydroxylase, dopa <b>decarboxylase</b> and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunohistochemistry in collaboration with Menek Goldstein and Tomas Hokfelt. During recent years an evolutionary constraint in the nuclear parcellation of the DA, NA and 5 -HT neurons was demonstrated in the order Rodentia and other mammals. The abundant existence of global monoamine varicose nerve terminal networks synthesizing, storing and releasing monoamines {{in various parts of}} the CNS, including the release of DA by tubero-infundibular DA neurons as a prolactin inhibitory factor from the external layer of the median eminence into the portal vessels and the appearance of extraneuronal DA fluorescence after, e. g., treatment with amphetamine in nialamide pretreated rats (Falck-Hillarp technique) were also remarkable observations. These observations and others like the discovery of transmitter-receptor mismatches opened up the possibility that monoamines were modulating the wired brain, built up mainly by glutamate and GABA neurons, through diffusion and flow in the extracellular fluid of the extracellular space and in the CSF. This transmission also involved long-distance channels along myelinated fibers and blood vessels and was called volume transmission (VT). The extracellular space (ECS), filled with a 3 D matrix, plays a fundamental role in this communication. Energy gradients for signal migration in the ECS are produced via concentration, temperature and pressure gradients, the latter two allowing a flow of the ECF and CSF carrying the VT signals. The differential properties of the wiring transmission (WT) and VT circuits and communication channels will be discussed as well as the role of neurosteroids and oxytocin receptors in volume transmission leading to a new understanding of the integrative actions of neuronal-glial networks. The role of tunneling nanotubes with mitochondrial transfer in CNS inter alia as part of neuron-glia interactions will also be introduced representing a novel type of wiring transmission.

Cells of the strains Enterococcus faecalis EF 37 and ATCC 29212, and Enterococcus faecium FC 12 and FC 643 were re-suspended in phosphate/citrate buffers with different pH, NaCl concentration and incubation temperature. At intervals, cell viability and tyramine production were assessed by plate counting and HPLC analysis, respectively. The activity of a purified <b>tyrosine</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> (TDC) was determined under the same conditions, as a reference. Reduced loss in cell viability was observed in all the tested conditions, except for pH 4 after 24 h. The TDC activity was greatly heterogeneous within the enterococci: EF 37 and FC 12 produced the higher tyramine concentrations, ATCC 29212 showed a reduced decarboxylase activity, while EF 643 did not accumulate detectable amounts of tyramine in all the conditions assayed. Among the considerate variables, temperature was the most influencing factor on tyramine accumulation for enterococcal cells. To further correlate the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of the enterococci, the TDC operon region carrying the genes <b>tyrosine</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> (tyrDC), tyrosine/tyramine permease (tyrP), and Na+/H+ antiporter (nhaC- 2) was amplified and sequenced. The genetic organization and nucleotide sequence of this operon region were highly conserved in the enterococcal strains of the same species. The heterogeneity in tyramine production found between the two E. faecalis strains could be ascribed to different regulation mechanisms not yet elucidated. On the contrary, a codon stop was identified in the translated tyrDC sequence of E. faecium FC 643, supporting its inability to accumulate tyramine in the tested conditions. In addition, the presence of an additional putative <b>tyrosine</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> with different substrate specificity and genetic organization was noticed for the first time.

Metabolic {{characterization}} of <b>tyrosine</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> gene from Rhodiola crenulata (RcTYDC) revealed that it {{played an important}} role in salidroside biosynthesis. Recombinant 53 kDa RcTYDC converted tyrosine into tyramine. RcTYDC gene expression was induced coordinately with the expression of RcUDPGT (the last gene involved in salidroside biosynthesis) in SA/MeJA treatment; the expression of RcTYDC and RcUDPGT was dramatically upregulated by SA, respectively 49 folds and 36 folds compared with control. MeJA also significantly increased the expression of RcTYDC and RcUDPGT in hairy root cultures. The tissue profile of RcTYDC and RcUDPGT was highly similar: highest expression levels found in stems, higher expression levels in leaves than in flowers and roots. The gene expressing levels were consistent with the salidroside accumulation levels. This strongly suggested that RcTYDC {{played an important role}} in salidroside biosynthesis in R. crenulata. Finally, RcTYDC was used to engineering salidroside biosynthetic pathway in R. crenulata hairy roots via metabolic engineering strategy of overexpression. All the transgenic lines showed much higher expression levels of RcTYDC than non-transgenic one. The transgenic lines produced tyramine, tyrosol and salidroside at higher levels, which were respectively 3. 21 – 6. 84, 1. 50 – 2. 19 and 1. 27 – 3. 47 folds compared with th...|$|E
40|$|The <b>tyrosine</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> operon of Lactobacillus brevis IOEB 9809 contains, {{adjacent}} to the <b>tyrosine</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> gene, a gene for TyrP, a putative tyrosine transporter. The two genes potentially form a proton motive tyrosine decarboxylation pathway. The putative tyrosine transporter gene of L. brevis was expressed in Lactococcus lactis and functionally characterized using right-side-out membranes. The transporter very efficiently catalyzes homologous tyrosine-tyro sine exchange and heterologous exchange between tyrosine and its decarboxylation product tyramine. Tyrosine-tyramine exchange was shown to be electrogenic. In addition to the exchange mode, the transporter catalyzes tyrosine uniport but {{at a much lower}} rate. Analysis of the substrate specificity of the transporter by use of a set of 19 different tyrosine substrate analogues showed that the main interactions between the protein and the substrates involve the amino group and the phenyl ring with the para hydroxyl group. The carboxylate group that is removed in the decarboxylation reaction does not seem to contribute to the affinity of the protein for the substrates significantly. The properties of the TyrP protein are those typical for precursor-product exchangers that operate in proton motive decarboxylation pathways. It is proposed that tyrosine decarboxylation in L. brevis results in proton motive force generation by an indirect proton pumping mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{levels of}} free amines and the {{activities}} of their biosynthetic enzymes were measured in a p-fluorophenylalanine resistant Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Xanthi cell line (TX 4) which accumulates high levels of cinnamoylamides, and a wild type cell line (TX 1). Putrescine in TX 1 and spermidine in TX 1 and TX 4 increased 4 -fold by day 4 but declined by day 8 of the culture period. Spermine levels were consistently low, while tyramine was not found in TX 1 until day 9 when a gradual rise was noted. Ornithine decarboxylase activity in TX 1 and TX 4 increased slightly through day 2 but declined gradually thereafter. S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity remained low throughout the culture period, and tyrosine and arginine decarboxylases in TX 1 were very low in activity. In contrast, {{the activities of}} tyrosine and arginine decarboxylases were elevated in TX 4, but a 3 -fold increase in tyramine after a subculture was not accompanied by a rise in <b>tyrosine</b> <b>decarboxylase.</b> However, <b>tyrosine</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> activity did increase during a second rise in tyramine levels in aging cells, late in the culture period.

40|$|According to {{the current}} edition of the Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology [11] the {{tyrosine}} decarboxylation test allows the differentiation of enterococci. Tyrosine is decarboxylated to the biogenic amine tyramine by E. faecalis and not by E. faecium strains. In the present study we sequenced the 16 S rDNA of two tyramine-producing strains, BIFI- 56 and BIFI- 58, presumptively classified as E. faecalis. Their 16 S rDNA were identical to the same fragment from the E. faecium type strain. Several E. faecium strains were then checked {{for their ability to}} decarboxylate tyrosine and also a putative tyrosine decarboxylase- coding gene was PCR amplified from these strains. All the strains confirmed as E. faecium produced tyramine and possessed a DNA fragment coding for a putative <b>tyrosine</b> <b>decarboxylase.</b> The concordance of the two methods allows us to conclude that the <b>tyrosine</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> test cannot be used in the differentiation of E. faecalis from E. faecium since at least some E. faecium strains are tyramine producers.

40|$|Abstract Background Even {{though the}} catecholamines (dopamine, {{norepinephrine}} and epinephrine) {{have been detected}} in plants their role is poorly documented. Correlations between norepinephrine, soluble sugars and starch concentration have been recently reported for potato plants over-expressing <b>tyrosine</b> <b>decarboxylase,</b> the enzyme mediating {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. More recently norepinephrine level was shown to significantly increase after osmotic stress, abscisic acid treatment and wounding. Therefore, it is possible that catecholamines might play a role in plant stress responses by modulating primary carbon metabolism, possibly by a mechanism similar to that in animal cells. Since to date no catecholamine receptor has been identified in plants we transformed potato plants with a cDNA encoding human dopamine receptor (HD 1). Results Tuber analysis of transgenic plants revealed changes in the activities of key enzymes mediating sucrose to starch conversion (ADP-glucose phosphorylase and sucrose synthase) and sucrose synthesis (sucrose phosphate synthase) leading to altered content of both soluble sugars and starch. Surprisingly the catecholamine level measured in transgenic plants was significantly increased; {{the reason for this is}} as yet unknown. However the presence of the receptor affected a broader range of enzyme activities than those affected by the massive accumulation of norepinephrine reported for plants over-expressing <b>tyrosine</b> <b>decarboxylase.</b> Therefore, it is suggested that the presence of the exogenous receptor activates catecholamine cAMP signalling in plants. Conclusions Our data support the possible involvement of catecholamines in regulating plant carbon metabolism via cAMP signalling pathway. </p...|$|E
