40|$|Over {{the course}} of this century, public transit systems in the U. S. have lost most of the market share of {{metropolitan}} travel to private vehicles. The two principal markets that remain for public transit systems are downtown commuters and <b>transit</b> <b>dependents</b> – people who are too young, too old, too poor, or physically unable to drive. Despite the fact that <b>transit</b> <b>dependents</b> are the steadiest customers for most public transit systems, transit policy has tended to focus on recapturing lost markets through expanded suburban bus, express bus, and fixed rail systems. Such efforts have collectively proven expensive and only marginally effective. At the same time, comparatively less attention and fewer resources tend to be devoted to improving well-patronized transit service in low-income, central-city areas serving a high proportion of <b>transit</b> <b>dependents.</b> This paper explores this issue through an examination of both the evolving demographics of public transit ridership, and the reasons for shifts in transit policies toward attracting automobile users onto buses and trains. We conclude that the growing dissonance between the quality of service provided to inner-city residents who depend on local buses and the level of public resources being spent to attract new transit riders is both economically inefficient and socially inequitable. In light of this, we propose that transportation planners concerned with social justice (and economic efficiency) should re-examine current public transit policies and plans...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMobile devices {{nowadays}} {{are equipped}} with sensors and technologies that enable context evaluation. Those devices are not expensive {{in such a way}} that everyone can buy a smart phone easily. So, developing mobile context-awareness applications for helping <b>dependent</b> <b>persons</b> to deal with their everyday tasks is crucial. This paper aims to develop a new identities manage-ment system that runs on the dependent person's mobile device. This agent will assist <b>dependent</b> <b>persons</b> by giving them information, advices, instructions and helps regarding their activities of daily living. The main idea is to use a simple communication way to identify objects and subjects in the surrounding context of the assisted person. In this paper we propose efficient identification mecha-nisms that take benefit from our well understanding of the context. Our ap-proach simplifies the use of the interaction between <b>dependent</b> <b>persons</b> and the agent. Hence, unlike usual approaches, the identity of a given entity will not be universal by widely tailored to the current person’s context. In the case where the context is shared by many entities with the risk of identification ambiguity, our identification could use different means such as colors or locations towards others for identification of entities...|$|R

40|$|The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) {{currently}} uses a {{flat fare}} structure, with {{several types of}} special passes, to collect passenger revenues. The fare structure is termed "flat" because each passenger pays the same base fare regardless of time, direction, or distance of travel. This analysis of MTA's ridership demographics shows that this fare structure is neither efficient, effective, nor equitable, though it does offer some operations simplicity. Typically <b>transit</b> <b>dependents</b> [...] riders who are more likely poor, non-white, young or old, and female [...] maker shorter trips, more non-work trips, and use regular monthly passes less than other comparable passenger groups. As a result, these <b>transit</b> <b>dependent</b> groups, on average, pay relatively more for transit service on a per mile basis, while covering a larger portion {{of the costs of}} providing the service, than do choice (or discretionary) riders. This report suggests that switching to a differentiated fare structure, where fares vary by mode, time of day, and/or distance traveled, could improve cost efficiency by more closely matching fares to the actual cost of service provision, increase service effectiveness by increased short distance and off-peak travel, and increase social equity by substantially reducing the cross-subsidy of higher-income riders by lower-income riders...|$|R
