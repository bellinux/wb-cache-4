5|$|After {{completion}} of NSYNC's PopOdyssey Tour, Bass moved to Star City, Russia, in much publicized {{pursuit of a}} seat on a Soyuz space capsule. Bass was certified by both NASA and the Russian Space Program after several months of cosmonaut training, and planned to join the TMA-1 mission <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> Station.

5|$|Continuous US {{presence}} aboard Mir {{started in}} 1996 with the March 22 launch of Atlantis on mission STS-76, when the Second Increment astronaut Shannon Lucid {{was transferred to}} the station. STS-76 was the third docking mission to Mir, which also demonstrated logistics capabilities through deployment of a Spacehab module, and placed experiment packages aboard Mirs docking module, which marked the first spacewalk which occurred around docked vehicles. The spacewalks, carried out from Atlantis's crew cabin, provided valuable experience for astronauts in order to prepare for later assembly missions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> Station.|$|E
5|$|In a major {{space policy}} speech in April 2010, Obama {{announced}} a planned change in direction at NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended {{plans for a}} return of human spaceflight {{to the moon and}} development of the Ares I rocket, Ares V rocket and Constellation program, in favor of funding Earth science projects, a new rocket type, and research and development for an eventual manned mission to Mars, and ongoing missions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> Station.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} its life, {{there were}} plans for private {{interests}} to purchase Mir, possibly for use as the first orbital television/movie studio. The privately funded Soyuz TM-30 mission by MirCorp, launched on 4 April 2000, carried two crew members, Sergei Zalyotin and Aleksandr Kaleri, to the station for two months to do repair work with the hope of proving that the station could be made safe. This was to be the last manned mission to Mir—while Russia was optimistic about Mir future, its commitments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> Station project left no funding to support the aging station.|$|E

5|$|The major Russian ORT TV station {{organised}} {{a national}} televised debate {{as to what}} should be done with the station. Former cosmonaut Georgi Grechko suggested that it should be kept in orbit long enough to salvage any useful equipment from it, for transfer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> Station or other spacecraft, however Konstantin Feoktistov argued that it would cost more to retrieve the equipment than to replace it. Anatoly Artsebarsky argued that Mir should be kept because he believed that once it had been deorbited, the US would try to marginalise Russian involvement in the ISS. An online opinion poll showed 67% support worldwide for keeping it in orbit.|$|E
5|$|Colonel George David Zamka– NASA astronaut– USMC– USNA Class of 1984: Born in Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1962, Zamka {{was raised}} in New York City; Irvington, New York; Medellín, Colombia; and Rochester Hills, Michigan. He flew 66 combat {{missions}} over occupied Kuwait and Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. In June 1998, Zamka was selected for the astronaut program, and reported for training in August. Zamka served as lead for the shuttle training and procedures division and as supervisor for the astronaut candidate class of 2004. Zamka completed his first spaceflight as the pilot of STS-120 (October, 13– November 7, 2007). STS-120 (Discovery) traveled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> Station to deliver the U.S. Node 2 Module, while also reconfiguring part of the station to prepare it for future assembly missions.|$|E
5|$|In service, Skylon could {{potentially}} {{lower the cost}} of launching satellites which, according to evidence submitted to the UK parliament by REL, is forecast to be around £650/kg; as of 2011, the average launch cost using conventional methods was estimated to be roughly £15,000/kg. Amongst other prospective operations, Skylon would be capable of transporting payloads of up to 10-tonnes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> Station. REL has also completed internal studies into the use of Skylon as a launch platform for a network of space-based solar power satellites, which have been historically unfeasible due to high launch costs. According to business publication Management Today, Skylon has been discussed as a possible replacement for NASA's Space Shuttle programme.|$|E

5|$|The {{country has}} {{developed}} into a centre of Islamic banking, and is {{the country with the}} highest numbers of female workers in that industry. Knowledge-based services are also expanding. To create a self-reliant defensive ability and support national development, Malaysia privatised some of its military facilities in the 1970s. The privatisation has created defence industry, which in 1999 was brought under the Malaysia Defence Industry Council. The government continues to promote this sector and its competitiveness, actively marketing the defence industry. Science policies in Malaysia are regulated by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation. The country is one of the world's largest exporters of semiconductor devices, electrical devices, and IT and communication products. Malaysia began developing its own space programme in 2002, and in 2006, Russia agreed to transport one Malaysian <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> Station as part of a multibillion-dollar purchase of 18 Russian Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighter jets by the Royal Malaysian Air Force.
