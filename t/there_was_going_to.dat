It had been booked in, that they were coming in to record their next single, and write it, with us. It was at Whitfield Street Studios and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be an MTV crew there filming them as they did this, which there was. Well, how on earth can you possibly do this? You can't write and record a song in half-an-hour with a film crew watching.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 he {{made the}} {{decision}} that if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a war, {{he wanted to be a}} fighter pilot, and so immediately joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. Within three months Lock had been called up and began flight training. On the outbreak of War in September 1939, as a trained pilot Lock joined the RAF as a sergeant pilot. After further training at No. 6 Flying School RAF Little Rissington, he was commissioned as a pilot officer (service number 81642) and posted to No. 41 Squadron at RAF Catterick, North Yorkshire, flying Spitfires.|$|E

25|$|In 2016 it {{had been}} {{announced}} that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> an off-Broadway revival of You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown, {{using some of the}} young stars of Broadway. The seven-member “Peanuts” gang featured Joshua Colley as Charlie Brown, Gregory Diaz as Schroeder, Aidan Gemme as Snoopy, Milly Shapiro as Sally, Mavis Simpson-Ernst as Lucy, and Jeremy T. Villas as Linus. Graydon Peter Yosowitz played the role of Charlie Brown from June 1-7. The show ran from May 24 – June 26, 2016.|$|E
25|$|The British had intercepted German {{communications}} {{coming from}} Washington and suspected that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{be an attempt}} to land arms at Ireland, although they were not aware of the precise location. The arms ship, under Captain Karl Spindler, was apprehended by HMS Bluebell on the late afternoon of Good Friday. About to be escorted into Queenstown (present-day Cobh), County Cork on the morning of Saturday 22 April, Captain Spindler scuttled the ship by pre-set explosive charges. It now lies at a depth of 40 metres. Its surviving crew became prisoners of war.|$|E
25|$|Thales, so {{the story}} goes, because of his poverty was taunted with the uselessness of philosophy; but from his {{knowledge}} of astronomy he had observed {{while it was still}} winter that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a large crop of olives, so he raised a small sum of money and paid round deposits for the whole of the olive-presses in Miletus and Chios, which he hired at a low rent as nobody was running him up; and when the season arrived, there was a sudden demand for a number of presses at the same time, and by letting them out on what terms he liked he realized a large sum of money, so proving that it is easy for philosophers to be rich if they choose.|$|E

25|$|Initially, {{the final}} was {{planned to take}} place on 7 March 2009 and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a second chance round before the final. Three song would have {{qualified}} directly for the final from each semi-final and the fourth placed songs would qualify for a second chance televote. After the second semi-final, TVE changed the plans: {{it was decided to}} move the date of the final and hold the third semi-final and the final jointly, and as a result, the fourth placed songs of the first two semi-finals qualified directly for the final. TVE claimed that the schedule was changed to aid the winning artist in preparing their performance, choreography and preview video for Eurovision, but the Spanish media assumed the decision was taken due to the low ratings the shows were getting.|$|E
25|$|At 3:30pm two umpires {{emerged from}} the players' race leading from the {{dressing}} rooms. The crowd roared its approval. It seemed <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be more play. The cordon of policemen, reinforced after the spectator intrusions of the first day, respectfully made way to allow the umpires to pass. But wait! Surely Tom Brooks {{does not have a}} beard. Robin Bailhache, slight in build though he is, is slightly more substantial than the youthful beanpole figure making his way to the centre. It took Bill Watkins, the groundsman at the M.C.G. to detect the impersonation. He hurried from his post by the covers in the centre of the ground to intercept the impostors and turn them back from whence they came. In tribute to a skilful piece of improvised humour, police sergeant Brian Watkins allowed them to make good their escape, instead of conducting them to the local lock-up.|$|E
25|$|On August 12, 1996, Mayne Queen {{departed}} Swartz Bay {{terminal and}} ran aground off Piers Island after losing steering control. The grounding occurred while performing a regular weekly {{test of the}} batteries for the steering control system. A crew member overheard <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a test, and {{in an attempt to}} be helpful and without direction, cut all power from the vessel's steering batteries, as he had done at night when the ship was stored, not realizing that the test in question only required the removal of a battery charger and that his assistance was neither requested nor required. No one was injured in the incident, and the vessel was assisted off the rocks at high tide, but it suffered extensive damage to its propulsion system, having two of the four steering and propulsion pods for the right-angle drives sheared off and one of the two remaining pods suffering propeller damage.|$|E

25|$|The {{main reason}} for these manoeuvers was to {{encircle}} the city to cut off escape and overwhelm from both sides. If the situation deteriorated {{on one of the}} fronts or flanks, the leader from the hill directed one part of the army to support the other. If it appeared that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be significant loss, the Mongols would retreat to save their troops and would engage the next day, or the next month, after having studied the enemies' tactics and defences in the first battle, or again send a demand to surrender after inflicting some form of damage. There was no fixture on when or where units should be deployed: it was dependent on battle circumstances, and the flanks and groups had full authority on what to do in the course of battle - such as supporting other flanks or performing an individual feigned retreat as conditions seemed appropriate, in small groups of 100 to 1000 - so long as the battle unfolded according to the general directive and the opponents were defeated.|$|E
500|$|During season one, {{the writers}} {{had the idea}} of {{introducing}} a character who was an actress and also created {{the outline of the}} fictional show where she would work Exposé. The [...] "long, daunting hours" [...] on the writer's room would sometimes lead to creating episodes of the fictional show, with ten being done when the Nikki-centered episode was written. Originally, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be an entire flashback episode in which Nikki {{was going to be a}} crime-fighting stripper, only to have it revealed that she was actually an actress. The idea was shortened to just one flashback spot. The role of Mr. LaShade was written with Billy Dee Williams in mind and, when he was cast, the color scheme of LaShade's hat was chosen in reference to his costume worn in his famed role as Lando Calrissian [...]|$|E
500|$|When {{it became}} public in early 2005 {{that the book}} would be published, representatives of Morrison {{contacted}} the publishers of the book.

But then {{this is a man who}} when he learnt that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a plaque erected outside his former Belfast home, got his solicitors to write to the Belfast Telegraph dissociating himself from the tribute." [...] The book was first published in 2005 by Secker & Warburg, and a 2006 edition was published by Vintage Books. Johnny Rogan appeared on a panel of experts in the 2008 documentary Van Morrison: Under Review 1964–1974, along with Steve Turner, author of the 1993 biography [...]|$|E

500|$|Also on the event's card, the TNA X Division Championship was contested for in an Ultimate X match, {{with the}} {{participants}} being the champion, Petey Williams, {{and the two}} challengers being, A.J.

In an Ultimate X match, four pillars are set up at ringside with steel red ropes attached at the top, which are criss-crossed to form an [...] "X" [...] over {{the center of the}} ring. The championship belt is hung on the center [...] "X" [...] with the objective being to remove it and fall to the mat below to win. On the December 17 episode of Impact!, Rhodes announced that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be an Ultimate X match at Final Resolution for the TNA X Division Championship.

500|$|The unsafe {{homeless}} {{man with whom}} Peter was seen leaving a youth-baseball team in Stewie's flashback was originally based on John Wayne Gacy, but people claimed he didn't look scary enough, so Povenmire changed the character completely {{to that of a}} {{homeless man}}. The idea of Stewie and Bertram laughing as they go down the slide during their sword fight was pitched by Povenmire's wife and, although negative about the idea at first, Povenmire included it in the episode because the original sketch was not going so well. During Peter and Lois' [...] "fat sex", Peter repeatedly states [...] "almost, almost"; originally, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be approximately twice as many of these, but they were never included in the episode. The DVD version of the episode shows Peter arriving at the sperm bank and saying to the receptionist: [...] "I have an appointment to banish a White Russian from my Kremlin", to which she replies with [...] "This is a sperm bank, you don't have to use innuendo", and Peter concludes the conversation with [...] "Where do I splooge?".|$|E
500|$|... "The Return of Harmony" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the second season. According to Thiessen, the Hub and its parent company Hasbro had [...] "approved the season two before we were done with season one; {{they knew they had}} {{something}} good on their hands." [...] He explained, [...] "they saw [...] of the show early on, which is [...] rare because usually a season will be one and aired before a network will renew it because {{they want to know what}} the numbers are, but they, I guess, a bit of a risk on their behalf, but I'm glad they did." [...] The finale scene of the episode is a parody of the ending from the 1977 movie [...] According to Thiessen, the joke was an [...] "afterthought"; originally, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a more elaborate ending, but due to time constraints, a new finale was created. During the animation stage, one of the directors noted that the scene was [...] "kind of like the ending to A New Hope" [...] and so, the decision was made to create [...] "scene for scene" [...] parody of the original.|$|E

500|$|Nightcrawler {{was filmed}} {{on a budget}} of $8.5 million, most of which was financed by Bold Films. Part of the budget came from the $2.3 million {{allocation}} from the California Film Tax Credit program, which rewards directors for producing films in California. Tony Gilroy noted the budget was extremely low, and should have [...] "easily cost twice that amount". In {{order to make the}} most out of the budget, Elswit built [...] "efficiencies" [...] into each day of the film schedule, a role that all three Gilroy brothers described as instrumental to the completion of the film. Before the filming for Nightcrawler began, the production crew spent two days location scouting across Los Angeles. Some crew members did not believe <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be enough time to film every scene, and that at least fifteen pages of the script would have to be cut; Gilroy took these comments as a personal challenge. Principal photography began on October 6, 2013 in Los Angeles and lasted 27 days. Filming was a challenging and busy process, as eighty locations were used, and there were many times in which the crew had to move to multiple locations each night. Gilroy remarked that there was never a day that filming was not completed minutes before sunrise.|$|E
500|$|... 150 people protested at the Church of Scientology {{building}} in Sydney, Australia, carrying signs and wearing costumes. Participants were masked {{to maintain their}} anonymity and avoid possible retaliation from the Church of Scientology. Protesters chanted [...] "Church on the left, cult on the right" [...] (in reference to the Church that was beside the Church of Scientology building), [...] "Religion is free" [...] and [...] "We want Xenu". Scientology staff locked down the building {{and set up a}} camera to record the event. After the protest in Sydney, a surge in online Internet traffic due to individuals attempting to view pictures from the protest crashed hundreds of websites when a server was overloaded. The Sydney protest {{was one of the first}} worldwide, and after the first images of the protest went online a surge in traffic drove the hosting company's bandwidth usage up by 900 percent. The hosting company Digitalis temporarily prevented access to hundreds of its clients' sites, and customer support representative Denis Kukic said the surge was unexpected: [...] "We had no advance notice that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a sudden surge of traffic or that there would be more than 100 times the average traffic that this customer's website normally consumes." ...|$|E
500|$|Pujols's {{highlights}} {{later in}} the season included a July game in which he hit five RBIs and three home runs and another in which he broke up a no-hitter by Giants pitcher Dustin Hermanson. During a September game against the Rockies, he earned his 500th RBI, joining DiMaggio and Ted Williams as the only players to have 500 RBIs in their first four seasons. He said he was confident <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "a lot more". Although Pujols was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis {{during the second half of}} the season, he finished the season with a [...]331 average (fifth in the league), 196 hits (fifth), 51 doubles (second to Lyle Overbay's 53), 46 home runs (tied with Adam Dunn for second behind Adrián Beltré's 48), and 123 RBIs (third, behind Vinny Castilla's 131 and Scott Rolen's 124) in 154 games. He also led the league in runs scored, with 133. He finished third in MVP voting (behind Bonds and Beltré), joining Musial as the only Cardinals to finish in the top five in voting for at least four years in a row. He won the Silver Slugger Award at first base, the third position he won the award at. Pujols, along with teammates Edmonds and Rolen, earned the nickname [...] "MV3" [...] for their phenomenal seasons; Pujols led the three in home runs and batting average.|$|E
