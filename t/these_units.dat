40|$|The {{early to}} middle Miocene erosive plate {{boundary}} {{preserved in the}} Northern Apennines NW of the Sillaro Line is formed by two distinct units - the Sestola-Vidiciatico Tectonic Unit and the Subli - gurian <b>Units.</b> <b>These</b> two <b>units</b> occupy, respectively, the SE and the NW portions of the studied area. Upon closer examination, the features that distinguish <b>these</b> mapped <b>units</b> do not reflect differing plate boundary processes, but rather the incorporation or non-incorporation of forearc-toe mass-wasting deposits into the active subduction channel. In other respects, <b>these</b> two <b>units</b> document similar subduction channel processes, including the contemporaneous activity of multiple sub-parallel slip surfaces.
