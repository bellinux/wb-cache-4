500|$|For me, in my {{mind the}} {{accomplishment}} is just that much sweeter. In <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> ethnicity, always feeling like an outsider, always feeling different ... for me it's about saying, 'Thank you Lord, for giving me the faith to believe in myself when other people had written me off.' I've gone through enough of my life worrying {{about that kind of}} thing. I want to encourage anyone else out there who feels like maybe they can't overcome an obstacle, I feel like I'm living proof ... never lose your faith. I'm seriously a grateful individual right now.|$|E
500|$|After {{starting}} 2006–07 as second-choice to Ricketts, Howarth {{sought a}} loan away from Bradford for first-team football, saying: [...] "It is approaching {{make or break}} in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> career. I need to start playing regularly again as soon as possible". Former club York, by this time playing in the Conference National, made a failed bid to sign him on loan in September 2006. Howarth's first and only appearance of the season, a 2–1 defeat at home to Scunthorpe in the Football League Trophy Northern Section first round on 17 October 2006, {{proved to be the}} last of his career. He was released by Bradford on 9 May 2007 and subsequently retired from professional football aged 25.|$|E

2500|$|In 1986, Bloom {{credited}} Northrop Frye as his nearest precursor. He told Imre Salusinszky in 1986: [...] "In <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own theorizations... {{the precursor}} proper {{has to be}} Northrop Frye. I purchased and read Fearful Symmetry {{a week or two}} after it had come out and reached the bookstore in Ithaca, New York. It ravished my heart away. I have tried to find an alternative father in Mr. Kenneth Burke, who is a charming fellow and a very powerful critic, but I don't come from Burke, I come out of Frye." ...|$|E
2500|$|At present, I am {{particularly}} {{excited by}} [...] "bad taste." [...] I have the deep {{feeling that there}} exists in {{the very essence of}} bad taste a power capable of creating those things situated far beyond what is traditionally termed [...] "The Work of Art." [...] I wish to play with human feeling, with its [...] "morbidity" [...] in a cold and ferocious manner. Only very recently I have become a sort of gravedigger of art (oddly enough, I am using the very <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> enemies). Some of my latest works have been coffins and tombs. During the same time I succeeded in painting with fire, using particularly powerful and searing gas flames, some of them measuring three to four meters high. I use these to bathe the surface of the painting {{in such a way that}} it registered the spontaneous trace of fire.|$|E
2500|$|Blackman {{is adamant}} that musicality {{has nothing to}} do with gender. [...] "The gender {{question}} is not even worth bringing up because the drums have got nothing to do with gender", Blackman says. [...] "I'm there because I love to play music. And I'm in support of anyone who wants to play the instrument. I wouldn't care if Art Blakey was pink with polka dots and wearing a tutu. I wouldn't care if Tony Williams was green." [...] "There are people who have opinions about whatever and whoever, in terms of gender, in terms of race and weight, hairstyle, religion", says Blackman. [...] "But to me, your personality influences what you play and what you do, but everything else is for you to develop and to nourish and to take further, and that's where I'm at. In <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> goals, me being a female drummer has nothing to with anything except for the fact that I wear bras and panties and guys don't." ...|$|E

2500|$|Flair {{engaged in}} an {{off-screen}} rivalry with Bret Hart. In October 1993, Hart gave a radio interview {{in which he said}} Flair [...] "sucks" [...] and described his workplace, WCW, as [...] "minor league". In Flair's autobiography, Flair criticizes Hart for over-exploiting the death of his brother Owen and the controversy surrounding the Montreal Screwjob. Flair also claimed in his autobiography that—despite Hart's popularity in Canada—he was not a formidable money-making draw in the United States, a claim which Hart dismissed as [...] "plain ridiculous" [...] in a column written for the Calgary Sun. Hart claimed that he drew greater revenue than Flair, citing his headlining performances on consistently sold out tours throughout his WWF career, while Flair wrestled to allegedly near-empty arenas. He also criticized Flair on what he perceived as insults to fellow wrestlers Mick Foley and Randy Savage, both personal friends of Hart. Hart acknowledged a decline in the WWF's popularity during the mid-1990s, but he and others felt that this was largely attributed to the WWF's well publicized sex and steroid scandals, as well as WCW's acquisition of former top WWF stars. In contrast to Flair's claims, prominent industry historian Dave Meltzer said there was [...] "no denying" [...] Hart's major drawing power in the United States. WWE owner Vince McMahon asserted that whichever company hired Hart could [...] "have built the entire franchise around Hart" [...] and described him as an [...] "extraordinary star". McMahon added that it was [...] "fortunate for me, in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> company", that his chief competitor, WCW, did not utilize Hart to his full potential. WCW described Hart as [...] "an incredible international draw, attracting standing room only crowds in every corner of the globe". Professional wrestling magazine Power Slam has spoken to Hart's drawing power, placing him number 7 in [...] "The 10 Best U.S.-Style All-Rounders", a list that considered drawing ability along with workrate and promo skills. Hart also criticized Flair in his own autobiography, mainly his in-ring talent and what Hart perceived as Flair's unsubtle blading. However, they have reconciled and are now friends.|$|E

60|$|NEXT morning came, {{chill and}} grey, and {{reminded}} me that I had two duties. I was to wait at home till Philippa came over from Mrs. Thompson's, and I was also to hang about {{the road from the}} station, and challenge Sir Runan to mortal combat. Can duties clash? They can. They did! The hours lagged slowly by, while I read Sir Runan's letter, read and re-read it, registered and re-registered (a pretty <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own invention) this vow of vengeance.|$|R

I had but a broken sleep the night before, in anticipation of the pleasure of a whole day with Em'ly. We were all astir betimes in the morning; and while we were yet at breakfast, Mr. Barkis appeared in the distance, driving a chaise-cart towards the object of his affections.|$|R

5000|$|I leave CBS News with {{tremendous}} memories. But I leave now {{most of all}} {{with the desire to}} once again do regular, meaningful reporting. My departure before the <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> contract represents CBS's final acknowledgement, after a protracted struggle, that they had not lived up to their obligation to allow me to do substantive work there. As for their offers of a future with only an office but no assignments, it just isn't in me to sit around doing nothing. So I will do the work I love elsewhere, and I look forward to sharing details about that soon.|$|R

I say nothing against it in a general way; I only speak of it {{as it relates to}} myself.

60|$|To {{those who}} have not chanced {{specially}} to study the subject, it may possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among WHALES--a word, which, in the popular sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness.

60|$|My first plan when I went abroad was {{to change}} my Harbury French, which was poor stuff and pedantic, into a more colloquial article, and then go into Germany {{to do the same}} thing with my German, and then perhaps to remain in Germany {{studying}} German social conditions--and the quality of the German army. It seemed to me that when the <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> exile was over I might return to England and re-enter the army. But all these were very anæmic plans conceived by a tired mind, and I set about carrying them out in a mood of slack lassitude.
