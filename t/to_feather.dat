Biting parasites {{include the}} louse fly Crataerina pacifica, bat bugs and sucking mites. Chewing lice include two species first identified on this swift. Davaineidae tapeworms {{have been found}} as internal parasites.|$|E
5|$|While ducks are {{naturally}} aquatic, swimming {{can be dangerous}} to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck's growth. Thus, although duckers would ensure the ducklings always had a trough or sink to paddle in, the ducklings would be kept away from bodies of water while they were growing. The exception was shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings would be taken for one swim in a pond, as it helped them <b>to</b> <b>feather</b> properly.|$|E

40|$|The design {{concept was}} to explore an ethical {{alternative}} <b>to</b> <b>feathers</b> in an environmentally friendly manner. This design was inspired by feather treatments used in couture gowns by designers such as Givenchy, Jean Paul Gauthier and Serkin Cura’s Spring Summer 2015 show. Feathers are rarely associated with cruelty to animals yet, according to PETA (2015) the feathers are usually plucked from the animal while it is alive. This design research project illustrates an exploration using an alternative <b>to</b> <b>feathers</b> in an environmentally and ethical manner...|$|R
25|$|The engine {{fire was}} the result of an oil leak. The engine was shut down and its {{propeller}} feathered due to severe vibrations. However, the starter/generator fitted to the engine had overheated {{to such an extent that}} it had burnt the tube supplying oil at high pressure <b>to</b> <b>feather</b> the propeller. When the crew feathered the propeller, the tube burst and the leaking oil caught fire.|$|E
25|$|With the Industrial Relations Act {{coming into}} effect, at the {{beginning}} of August 1972 Adamson agreed with Victor Feather of the TUC to set up an independent conciliation and advice service. According <b>to</b> <b>Feather</b> both sides saw this as one means of minimising the use of the Act. Through 1973 the government, CBI and TUC tried to establish a working relationship which suited all, but were unable to do so before the economic effects of the oil price rise caused profound disruption to the British economy. On other issues Adamson was strongly supportive of the Government, including giving consistent backing to entry to the European Communities. His leadership in this area was said to be crucial.|$|E
25|$|Feather {{work and}} the conquest led to a {{creative}} exchange from the conquest to about 1800. Evangelism added Christian themes <b>to</b> <b>feather</b> work, including the making of ritual items. Amantecas were creating Christian religious images within months after {{the arrival of the}} conquistadors, destined for Europe as well as Asia. The first known Christian-inspired pictures in feather work were made for banners, on a cotton cloth with an imprimatur, on which the design was made. They had a backing of very fine palm or rush mats bound with twine or vegetable lianas. The Huejotzingo Codex depicts the making of a feather and gold banner, the first indication of feather work with Christian images.|$|E
50|$|The {{main points}} to the {{transition}} from reptile to bird are the evolution from scales <b>to</b> <b>feathers,</b> {{the evolution of the}} beak (although independently evolved in other organisms), the hallofication of bones, development of flight, and warm-bloodedness.|$|R
5000|$|The bark of the Alstonia scholaris (Milky Pine) was {{ground to}} a powder which was then used as a glue <b>to</b> attach <b>feathers</b> <b>to</b> skin for ceremonies.|$|R
50|$|Other bird species, such as harriers, {{have less}} {{prominent}} facial discs. In harriers, the related term facial ruff refers <b>to</b> <b>feathers</b> {{around the neck}} that are raised in response to noise, essentially enlarging the facial disc and improving hearing.|$|R
25|$|Adults have a pale buff head, {{changeable}} {{between a}} more brownish {{and an almost}} white hue according <b>to</b> <b>feather</b> wear and individual variation. The broad black face mask stretches across the neck as a narrow collar, bordered with white. On the crown, the feather shafts are dark, producing a somewhat streaked effect. The upper wings and back are blackish brown. The uppertail coverts are whitish buff again, and the rectrices are barred black and whitish, ending in white. The underside is uniformly pale buff; {{there may be a}} bit of dark speckling on the thighs, however. The underside of the wing is pale rufous-buff, sometimes with some dark spotting on the underwing coverts. The tips of the primary remiges are barred with pale grey below, their bases are quite rufous. The iris is dark brown, the bill is black with a pale yellow cere; the feet are also pale yellow.|$|E
500|$|Feathers being {{critical}} {{to the survival of}} a bird, require maintenance. Apart from physical wear and tear, feathers face the onslaught of fungi, ectoparasitic feather mites and birdlice. The physical condition of feathers are maintained by [...] often with the application of secretions from the [...] Birds also bathe in water or dust themselves. While some birds dip into shallow water, more aerial species may make aerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves. Birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust-bathe. A behaviour termed as anting in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers. Many species will spread out their wings and expose them to direct sunlight and this too is thought to help in reducing fungal and ectoparasitic activity that may lead <b>to</b> <b>feather</b> damage.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, it {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that anting is related <b>to</b> <b>feather</b> moulting. [...] The metabolic products of the ants may soothe skin irritated by unusually rapid feather replacement. [...] However, the correlation may also be attributed to the greater activity of ants in summer.|$|E
5000|$|Natal down {{color is}} not related <b>to</b> <b>feathering</b> speed, but in {{chickens}} of full-black adult plumage, chicks normally have shorter natal down than those from breeds of any other plumage color pattern [...] this shortening being more obvious {{in the head and}} back.|$|R
25|$|In some surveys, {{involving}} larger birds such as eagles, brightly coloured plastic tags {{are attached}} <b>to</b> birds' wing <b>feathers.</b> Each has a letter or letters, {{and the combination}} of colour and letters uniquely identifies the bird. These can then be read in the field, through binoculars, meaning {{that there is no}} need to re-trap the birds. Because the tags are attached <b>to</b> <b>feathers,</b> they drop off when the bird moults.|$|R

2500|$|Also, sweep oar rowers usually feather {{and square}} the oar with the inside hand (the one {{closer to the}} rowlock), {{allowing}} the handle to turn within the outside hand, whose wrist remains flat throughout. This is obviously not possible in sculling, and scullers tend <b>to</b> <b>feather</b> and square by holding the oar handle in the extended fingers when feathered, and rolling it into the palm of the hand to square it, the wrist remaining flat throughout.|$|E
50|$|Females are {{slightly}} {{smaller than the}} males and are paler in colour, with fewer spots running down the flanks. Juveniles are even paler than the female, appearing more brown than black, with fainter yellow colouring <b>to</b> <b>feathers</b> and with a grey bill rather than the pink seen on adults.|$|R
50|$|This warbler {{is large}} and {{brownish}} with broad dark streaks <b>to</b> the <b>feathers</b> of the crown and back and can appear almost babbler-like in appearance (easily mistaken for common babbler). The tail is graduated with white tips <b>to</b> the <b>feathers.</b> The rachis of the tail feathers is dark and there are dark ribs <b>to</b> the <b>feathers.</b> The bill is strong. The tarsus is brown and the bill is black with the lower mandible tipped bluish grey. They have a buff supercilium (brow) and have a pale unmarked underside.|$|R
50|$|The only {{significant}} biography of Keulemans is by Jan Coldewey and Tony Keulemans, <b>Feathers</b> <b>to</b> Brush, {{a book that}} includes a bibliography of the artist's publications, a genealogical tree and appendices detailing his spiritualism, {{with a sample of}} his financial correspondence. Also of note is a contemporary obituary of Keulemans in the journal British Birds (1912). Tony Keulemans later wrote Beyond the grave, which {{tells the story of a}} remarkable discovery of a painting John Gerrard had made of his own grave stone. And finally Tony Keulemans wrote an errata list <b>to</b> <b>Feathers</b> <b>to</b> Brush, which includes additional literature references and new genealogical findings.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to painting, it is {{desirable}} <b>to</b> <b>feather</b> any edges between metal and old paint. It {{is also important to}} check the surface for oil deposited during chipping, and if necessary, clean the area with solvents. Since bare metal surfaces will flash rust soon after exposure to the atmosphere, paint should be applied as soon as possible after [...] chipping. [...] If flash rusting occurs prior to coating, further chipping, cleaning and sanding may be necessary.|$|E
2500|$|At 12:52 pm the Flight Service Unit at Longreach heard a radio {{transmission}} from {{the crew of}} Flight 149 saying they were making an emergency descent. [...] Two minutes later the crew notified Longreach they had a fire warning for number 2 engine and had been unable <b>to</b> <b>feather</b> the propeller. [...] At 12:59 pm Longreach received a message relayed by the crew of a Douglas DC-3 saying fire in the engine nacelle was visible to the crew of Flight 149 and they were diverting to land at Winton airport, 92nautical miles (171km) from Longreach.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the latter}} 20th century, {{a number of}} artists tried {{to bring back the}} {{technique}} as an art form. Painter and tapestry weaver Carmen Padin began researching the technique after hearing Fernando Gamboa lament its loss. From 1979 to 1981, she exhibited her work in various cities of Mexico which included robes, capes, shields and collages. However, she had to stop by the 1990s because of the difficultly of obtaining feathers. Josefina Ortega Salcedo became attracted to the technique after reading about it in the Artes de México magazine. She studied drawing and painting at the Academy of San Carlos with the goal of applying them <b>to</b> <b>feather</b> work. Her most valuable work in this medium includes several portraits, copied from photographs with precision. Her images are placed on a base of light-colored feathers with the images arranged using crepe paper cut outs and colored feathers. [...] However, she, too, no longer works with this technique. Those who still continue to work with it include Elena Sanchez Garrido, who combines feather work and watercolors, and Tita Bilbaro who makes Aztec and modern style images using feathers, sand, fabric, leather, mirrors an sea shells. In the late 1980s she exhibited her work in Mexico City and several places in northern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In dogs, canine {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder {{can lead to}} self-inflicted injuries, for example canine lick granuloma. Captive birds are sometimes known to engage in feather-plucking, causing damage <b>to</b> <b>feathers</b> that can range from <b>feather</b> shredding <b>to</b> the removal of most or all feathers within the bird's reach, or even the mutilation of skin or muscle tissue.|$|R
50|$|The eagle feather law (Title 50 Part 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations) {{stipulates}} that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry {{enrolled in a}} federally recognized tribe are legally authorized <b>to</b> obtain eagle <b>feathers</b> for religious or spiritual use.

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} from Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii, at 8:26p.m. HST on the flight's last leg to San Francisco. After passing the point of equal time, the flight received permission to climb to an altitude of [...] When that altitude was reached, the No. 1 engine began to overspeed as power was reduced. The First Officer, who was flying the plane, immediately slowed the plane by further reducing power and by extending the flaps, and {{an attempt was made}} <b>to</b> <b>feather</b> the propeller. The propeller would not feather and the engine continued to turn at excessive RPM. [...] The captain decided to cut off the oil supply to the engine. Eventually, the RPM declined and the engine seized. [...] The propeller continued to windmill in the air stream, causing excessive drag that increased the fuel consumption. As a result, the plane was forced to fly much more slowly, below , and lost altitude at the rate of [...] [...] Climb power was set on the remaining three engines to slow the rate of descent. [...] The No. 4 engine then began to fail and soon was producing only partial power at full throttle. [...] At 2:45a.m. the No. 4 engine began to backfire, forcing the crew to shut it down and feather the propeller.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} race of 1989, the Daytona 500, Waltrip {{won the race}} {{for the first time in}} his 17th attempt with a fuel {{conservation}} strategy along with his long-time crew-chief Jeff Hammond, making his final pit stop for fuel a distant 53 laps (132 miles) from the finish. Most of the other cars could run no more than 45 or 46 laps on a tank of fuel, so that meant Waltrip would need <b>to</b> <b>feather</b> the throttle and [...] "draft" [...] off other cars in order to save enough fuel to make it to the finish without an additional pit stop. Hammond, interviewed by television pit reporters during the final stint of the race, said that his strategy was for Waltrip to [...] "draft off anybody, and everybody", to save fuel. Even though Waltrip's car ran much slower than other cars in the last 53 laps, he was able to avoid making the additional pit stop for fuel that the other cars had to make. The strategy provided Waltrip with the track position needed to win the race. His post-race interview with CBS pit reporter Mike Joy, became famous, with Waltrip shouting [...] "I won the Daytona 500! I won the Daytona 500! Wait, this is the Daytona 500 ain't it? ...Thank God!", accompanied by the [...] "Ickey Shuffle" [...] dance in Victory Lane. Later, after the Daytona 500 win, Waltrip visited president George H. W. Bush at the white House in Washington, D.C.|$|E
2500|$|Stereotypies are repetitive, {{sometimes}} abnormal behaviors like pacing on the perch for birds. There are adaptive stereotypic {{behaviors such}} as grooming in cats and preening in birds. Captive parrots commonly perform a range of stereotypies. These behaviors are repeated identically and lack any function or goal. Captive parrots perform striking oral and locomotor stereotypies like pacing on the perch or repetitive play with a certain toy. Feather picking and loud vocalizations can be stereotypies but are not as rigid and may be reactions to confinement, stress, boredom and loneliness {{as studies have shown}} that parrots that are in cages closest to the door are the most prone <b>to</b> <b>feather</b> pick or scream. Feather picking is not a true stereotypy and is more like hair pulling in human and loud vocalizations or screaming can be a stereotypy but vocalization is part of a parrot's natural behavior. [...] Captive parrots lack sufficient stimulation. Presumably they suffer from lack of companionship and opportunities to forage. [...] Stereotypies can evolve from the social environment for example {{the presence or absence of}} certain social stimuli, social isolation, low feeder space and high stocking density (especially for tail biting in pigs). These behaviors can also be transmitted through social learning. [...] Bank voles, pigeons and pigs when housed next to animals that show stereotypies, pick them up as well as through stimulus enhancement which is what happens in tail biting in pigs and feather pecking by hens.|$|E

50|$|Though {{once thought}} to be a feature {{exclusive}} <b>to</b> coelurosaurs, <b>feathers</b> or feather-like structures are also known in some ornithischian dinosaurs (like Tianyulong and Kulindadromeus), and in pterosaurs.
