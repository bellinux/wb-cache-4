6000|$|He {{knew that}} the brig had arrived, {{though he did not}} know that Jasper was already with his daughter. I suppose he didn't think it was {{possible}} in the time. A father naturally wouldn't. He suspected that Allen was sweet on his girl; the fowls of the air and the fishes of the sea, most of the traders in the Archipelago, and all sorts and conditions of men in the town of Singapore were aware of it. But he was not capable of appreciating how far the girl was gone on the fellow. He had an idea that Freya was too sensible to ever be gone on anybody--I mean to an unmanageable extent. No; it was not that which made him sit on the back verandah and worry himself in his unassuming manner during Jasper's visits. What he worried about were the Dutch [...] "authorities." [...] For {{it is a fact that}} the Dutch looked askance at the doings of Jasper Allen, owner and master of the brig Bonito. They considered him much too enterprising in his trading. I don't know that he ever did anything illegal; but it seems to me that his immense activity was repulsive to their stolid character and slow-going methods. Anyway, in old Nelson's opinion, the captain of the Bonito was a smart sailor, and a nice young man, but not a desirable acquaintance upon the whole. Somewhat compromising, you understand. On the other hand, he did not like to tell Jasper in so many words to keep away. Poor old Nelson himself was a nice fellow. I believe he would have shrunk from hurting the feelings even of a mop-headed cannibal, unless, perhaps, under very strong provocation. I mean the feelings, not the bodies. As against spears, knives, hatchets, clubs, or arrows, old Nelson had proved himself capable of taking his own part. In every other respect he had a <b>timorous</b> <b>soul.</b> So he sat on the back verandah with a concerned expression, and whenever the voices of his daughter and Jasper Allen reached him, he would blow out his cheeks and let the air escape with a dismal sound, like a much tried man.|$|E

(1951), {{in response}} to Lord Denning's dissent that [...] "there were the <b>timorous</b> <b>souls</b> who were fearful of allowing a new cause of action", Asquith wrote that [...] "If this relegates me to the company of <b>timorous</b> <b>souls,</b> I must face that consequence with such fortitude as I can command".|$|R

That brought him to reason for a time. But {{he was one of}} those weak creatures, void of pride, <b>timorous,</b> anaemic, hateful <b>souls,</b> full of shifty cunning, who face neither God nor man, who face not even themselves.|$|R
