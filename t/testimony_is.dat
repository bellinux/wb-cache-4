5|$|Agent Lang visits Mahone {{and offers}} him a deal: {{eight years in}} a St. Louis prison in {{exchange}} for testifying against {{the government in the}} Lincoln Burrows conspiracy, or multiple homicide charges if he does not cooperate. Mahone eventually accepts the offer and confesses to Lang that he killed Shales, and that guilt made him turn to drugs. Because he is unable to maintain his composure while testifying, Mahone's <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> dismissed, and Lang is forced to return Mahone to Sona.|$|E
5|$|General Robert C. Oaks, USAF, Commander of United States Air Forces in Europe, {{immediately}} appointed an Air Force Regulation (AFR) 110-14 {{accident investigation}} board composed of a board president, 11 board members from the USAF and U.S. Army, three associate members from France, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, four legal advisers, and 13 technical advisers. The board president was Major General James G. Andrus, USAF. An AFR 110-14 investigation's findings are publicly released and the testimony of witnesses in the investigation can be used against them in military disciplinary proceedings. For this reason, after serious mishaps the USAF usually also conducts a separate safety investigation, in which the results are not publicly released and witness <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> immune from prosecution. In this case, however, for unknown reasons the USAF decided not to conduct a safety investigation.|$|E
5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, {{it has been said that}} Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E

5|$|Mulder finds Scully {{underground}} in Antarctica, {{in a large}} facility containing many {{humans in}} ice-like enclosures. He breaks Scully's confinement and uses the vaccine to revive her, but this disrupts the facility and cocooned aliens begin trying to escape. Just after the agents escape to the surface, a huge alien vessel emerges from beneath the ice and travels into the sky. Mulder watches it disappear into the distance as Scully regains consciousness. Some time later, Scully attends a hearing, where her <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> disregarded and the evidence covered up. She hands over the only remaining proof of their ordeal, the bee that stung her, noting that the FBI is not currently capable of investigating this evidence. Outside, Mulder reads an article that has covered up the domes and crop field in Texas; Scully informs Mulder that she is willing to continue working with him.|$|E

25|$|If scientific, technical, {{or other}} {{specialized}} knowledge will assist the {{trier of fact}} to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto {{in the form of}} an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.|$|E

25|$|The {{literacy}} campaign, which Shenouda the Archimandrite waged in his monastery, reflected positively on {{the library}} of the monastery.

This <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> not only in the number of codices identified, but also in the wide variety of subjects it possessed.|$|E
25|$|The Seventh-day Adventist Church {{grew out}} of the Adventist movement, in {{particular}} the Millerites. The Seventh-day Adventist Church is the largest of several Adventist groups which arose from the Millerite movement of the 1840s in upstate New York, a phase of the Second Great Awakening. Important to the Seventh-day Adventist movement is a belief in progressive revelation, teaching that the Christian life and <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> intended to be typified by the Spirit of Prophecy, as explained in the writings of Ellen G.

25|$|Father Loison {{described}} {{many examples}} of violence, mostly indiscriminate, directed at the civilian population in the region where he resides.

He described murders of unarmed civilians, including women and children, rape followed in many instances by torture or murder, and indiscriminate terror designed to coerce the civilian population. His testimony was similar to various reports including the International Human Rights Law Group, Amnesty International, and others.|$|E
25|$|According {{to his own}} account, he {{continued}} his education at Durham, learning the trivium and quadrivium, with Virgil, Plato and Plotinus among his favourite authors. If Lawrence's own <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> to be believed, he was held in high acclaim in his early years for his poetry and fine singing. In Lawrence's time as a teacher, he may have taught Ailred, later abbot of Rievaulx. Lawrence took up {{a place in the}} bishop's court during the episcopate of Geoffrey Rufus (1133–1141). Probably an episcopal chaplain, Lawrence was cantor and may have held the post of receiver general in Bishop Geoffrey's exchequer.|$|E
25|$|Simplicity to Friends has {{generally}} been a reference to material possessions. Friends have often limited their possessions to {{what they need to}} live their lives, rather than accumulating luxuries. The <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> not just about the nature of one's material possessions, but rather also about one's attitude towards these material goods. Many Friends who have been considered exemplary have also been wealthy; their commitment to the testimony, however, led them to use their wealth for spiritual purposes, including aid to the poor and oppressed. On the other hand, some Friends, such as John Woolman, gave up much of their wealth and economic position when they felt it to be a spiritual burden.|$|E

25|$|The Peace <b>Testimony</b> <b>is</b> {{probably}} the best known testimony of Friends. The belief that violence is wrong has persisted to this day, and many conscientious objectors, advocates of non-violence and anti-war activists are Friends. Because of their peace testimony, Friends are considered {{as one of the}} historic peace churches. In 1947 Friends as a worldwide religious group were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which was accepted by the American Friends Service Committee and the then London Yearly Meeting's Friends Service Committee, now called Britain Yearly Meeting Peace & Social Witness on behalf of all Friends. The Peace Testimony has not always been well received in the world; on many occasions Friends have been imprisoned for refusing to serve in military activities.|$|E
25|$|In {{criminal}} law, Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), reformulated {{the standard}} for determining when the admission of hearsay statements in criminal cases is permitted under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Crawford gives enhanced protection to defendants when the hearsay offered against them is testimonial in nature. When a statement is deliberately accusatory, or when the declarant knows that the statement {{is likely to be}} used in the prosecution of the defendant for a crime, the need for face-to-face confrontation is at its highest. When statements are directly accusatory, the defense needs an opportunity to explore the accuser's motives. Where statements are the product of police interrogation, there is a need to ensure that the <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> not the product of improper coercion or intimidation.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., the Daubert Standard {{is a legal}} {{precedent}} set in 1993 by the Supreme Court {{regarding the}} admissibility of expert witness testimony during legal proceedings, set in place to ensure that expert <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> based on sufficient facts or data, derived from proper application of reliable principles and methods. When multiple forensic artists produce approximations for {{the same set of}} skeletal remains, no two reconstructions are ever the same and the data from which approximations are created are largely incomplete. Because of this, forensic facial reconstruction does not uphold the Daubert Standard, is not considered a legally recognized techniques for positive identification, and is not admissible as expert testimony. Currently, reconstructions are only produced to aid the process of positive identification in conjunction with verified methods.|$|E
