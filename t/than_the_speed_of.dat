5|$|Hubble's law violates special {{theory of}} {{relativity}}: Hubble's law predicts that galaxies {{that are beyond}} Hubble Distance recede faster <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light. However, special relativity does not apply beyond motion through space. Hubble's law describes velocity that results from expansion of space, rather than through space.|$|E
5|$|The heliosphere, the tenuous {{outermost}} {{atmosphere of}} the Sun, {{is filled with the}} solar wind plasma. This outermost layer of the Sun is defined to begin at the distance where the flow of the solar wind becomes superalfvénic—that is, where the flow becomes faster <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> Alfvén waves, at approximately 20 solar radii (0.1 AU).|$|E
5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between a redshift in cosmological context as compared to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a local Doppler-effect redshift. Rather than cosmological redshifts being {{a consequence of the}} relative velocities that are subject to the laws of special relativity (and thus subject to the rule that no two locally separated objects can have relative velocities with respect to each other faster <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light), the photons instead increase in wavelength and redshift because of a global feature of the spacetime metric through which they are traveling. One interpretation of this effect is the idea that space itself is expanding. Due to the expansion increasing as distances increase, the distance between two remote galaxies can increase at more than 3 m/s, but this does not imply that the galaxies move faster <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light at their present location (which is forbidden by Lorentz covariance).|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with <b>the</b> propagating <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> transition fronts in $R^N$ for spatially periodic bistable reaction-diffusion equations. The notion of transition fronts generalizes the standard notions of traveling fronts. Under the a priori assumption that there exist pulsating fronts for every direction $e$ with nonzero speeds, we show some continuity and differentiability properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front <b>speeds</b> and profiles {{with respect to the}} direction $e$. Finally, we prove that <b>the</b> propagating <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> any transition front is larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> infimum <b>of</b> <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> pulsating fronts and less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> supremum <b>of</b> <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> pulsating fronts.

5|$|In {{models of}} the {{expanding}} universe, the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. This receding is not due to motion through space, but rather {{to the expansion of}} space itself. For example, galaxies far away from Earth appear to be moving away from the Earth with a speed proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called the Hubble sphere, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light.|$|E
5|$|Captain Robert L. Cardenas, USAAF, {{served as}} a B-24 {{aircraft}} pilot in the European Theater of Operations with the 506th Bombardment Squadron. He was awarded the Air Medal and two oak leaf clusters for bombing missions before being shot down over Germany in March 1944. Despite head wounds from flak, {{he made his way}} back to Allied control. On October 14, 1947, Cardenas flew the B-29 launch aircraft that released the X-1 experimental rocket plane in which Charles E.

5|$|Early Islamic {{philosophers}} initially {{agreed with}} the Aristotelian view that light had no speed of travel. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the Book of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite speed, and that {{the speed of light}} is variable, decreasing in denser bodies. He argued that light is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from our senses. Also in the 11th century, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī agreed that light has a finite speed, and observed that the speed of light is much faster <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound.|$|E

5|$|The Fall of Reach {{takes place}} in the Halo {{universe}} and spans several decades, beginning in 2517 describing events up to 2552. In the Halo universe, traveling faster <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light is possible through slipspace, another dimension where special relativity does not apply. This has allowed humans to colonize hundreds of other planets which are controlled by the United Nations Space Command (UNSC). Feeling repressed by the UNSC's heavy-handed rule, some colonies revolt; fearing rebellion will tear the UNSC apart, military leaders approve the SPARTAN Project, a secret squad of super soldiers to quietly suppress rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Mayor West {{passes a}} law to legalize the drug, and {{everyone}} starts smoking it; the town has improved as a result, with milestones such as an increase in productivity {{and a decrease in}} crime. However, Lois's father, Carter, begins to lose money in the timber industry since hemp is being used to manufacture many products, particularly paper, and he bribes Peter to help him with an anti-marijuana campaign. Lois, however, points out that their methods are uninspired, explaining that Brian only succeeded because he was passionate about legalizing cannabis. Carter decides to bribe Brian to join his cause by publishing and shipping his novel, Faster <b>Than</b> <b>the</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>of</b> Love. Brian resists at first, but Stewie suggests he at least perform a number about the health risks of cannabis, since the book does not have enough merit to sell on its own. Brian reluctantly complies, and the drug becomes illegal once more.|$|E
5|$|The {{solutions}} for R(t) depend on k and Λ, but some qualitative features of such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the length scale R of the Universe can remain constant {{only if the}} Universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (k=1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by Albert Einstein. However, this equilibrium is unstable: because the Universe {{is known to be}} inhomogeneous on smaller scales, R must change over time. When R changes, all the spatial distances in the Universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself. This accounts for the observation that galaxies appear to be flying apart; the space between them is stretching. The stretching of space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two galaxies can be 40 billion light years apart, although they started from the same point 13.8 billion years ago and never moved faster <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light.|$|E

30|$|To simplify an {{understanding}} {{and interpretation of}} results from Theorem  3.1, we consider one dimensional space and we scale κ to one. Then s_ 1 and s_ 2 are <b>the</b> average <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> each individual prey and predator, respectively. We define slow movement as the case where <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> at which a band of prey moves is less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> average <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> each prey (i.e., c< s_ 1), and fast movement otherwise. We also define weak predation as the situation where <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> at which a band of predator catches a prey is less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> average <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> each predator (i.e., c< s_ 2), and strong predation otherwise.

25|$|Aerodynamic {{problems}} {{can also be}} classified according to whether the flow speed is below, near or above {{the speed of sound}}. A problem is called subsonic if all the speeds in the problem are less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound, transonic if speeds both below and above the speed of sound are present (normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound), supersonic when the characteristic flow speed is greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound, and hypersonic when the flow speed is much greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound. Aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow; a rough definition considers flows with Mach numbers above 5 to be hypersonic.|$|E

25|$|Combustion {{can vary}} in degree of violence.

Similarly, it is also argued that the apparent superluminal effects discovered by Günter Nimtz can be explained by a thorough consideration of the velocities involved.|$|E
