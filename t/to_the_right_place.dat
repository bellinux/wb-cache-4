Testifying before the 9/11 Commission in April 2004, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft recalled that the [...] "single greatest structural cause for the September 11th problem was the wall that segregated or separated criminal investigators and intelligence agents."

500|$|After days {{of media}} speculation, it was {{confirmed}} on September 6, 2007, that Spears {{would open the}} 2007 MTV Video Music Awards at the Pearl Theatre in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, on September 9, 2007. It was also announced {{that she was going}} to perform [...] "Gimme More", with a magic act from illusionist Criss Angel in some parts of the performance. However, the bit is thought to have been rejected by the show's organizers at the last minute. The executive producer of the 2007 VMAs Jesse Ignjatovic contacted Spears since she wanted to start the show in [...] "a very big and dramatic way", and was confident that Spears would deliver and set the tone for the rest of the night. She also said Spears was excited after she was approached by MTV to perform. On September 7, 2007, Spears started rehearsing at the Pearl Theater. An exclusive video from the rehearsal was posted on MTV.com the following day. The performance began with a close-up of the back of Spears's head, and continued with Spears turning to the camera and lip synching the first lines of Elvis Presley's 1958 song [...] "Trouble": [...] "If you're lookin' for trouble, you came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>place</b> / If you're lookin' for trouble, look right in my face." [...] "Gimme More" [...] began, and the camera panned out to reveal Spears wearing a black, jewel-encrusted bikini and black boots. She was accompanied by male and female dancers dressed in black outfits. Several pole dancers danced in smaller stages around the audience. The backdrop videos featured images of chandeliers floating and silhouettes of women, which were compared by Gil Kaufman of MTV to the gun barrel and title sequence of the James Bond series. At the end of the performance, Spears smiled and thanked the audience before leaving the stage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a new client-driven pointer analysis algorithm that automatically adjusts its precision in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> needs of client analyses. We evaluate our algorithm on 18 real C programs, using five significant error detection problems as clients. We compare the accuracy {{and performance of}} our algorithm against several commonly-used fixed-precision algorithms. We find that the client-driven approach effectively balances cost and precision, often producing results as accurate as fixed-precision algorithms that are many times more costly. Our algorithm works because many client problems only need {{a small amount of}} extra precision applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>places</b> in each input program. ...|$|R

50|$|Portrait of a Carthusian {{depicts a}} three-quarter {{portrait}} of anonymous Carthusian monk captured in mid-turn, gazing {{directly at the}} viewer. Because the monk’s body is turned to his left, he must look over his right shoulder <b>to</b> gaze at <b>the</b> viewer, creating a somewhat cumbersome diagonal pose. Petrus Christus balances this out by shifting the axis of <b>the</b> monk’s face <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> <b>placing</b> him just off center.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Human {{attention}} is generally the most limited resource in any human-machine system. From annunciator systems in {{nuclear power plants}} to highlighted links on webpages, the prime task of the designer is directing <b>the</b> user's attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>places.</b> According <b>to</b> feature integration theory, important symbols can be designed to "pop-out" from a field of distractor objects due to pre-attentive processing. (Triesman 1986). This theory has spawned numerous follow-up studies to attempt to isolate features that are pre-attentive (Ware 2000). Unlike artificial displays that have single parameters with definable set points, open scenes lack easy criteria for directing attention. Capturing Attention is particularly difficult in open scenes such as detailed aerial photographs, wide angle/multiple video feeds, or high-resolution digital imagery. Moreover, open scenes {{tend to have more}} ambiguity since information is compiled from sensors rather than synthetically fabricated. If un...|$|R
