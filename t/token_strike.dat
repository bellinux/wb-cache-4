2500|$|But the AA seriously misjudged {{both the}} {{economics}} {{and the technology}} underlying the tin industry. [...] The formation of the American Tin Plate Company, a monopoly trust, on December 14, 1898, brought a number of nonunion plants into the union facilities of the American Tinplate Company. Daniel G. Reid, primary owner of the tin plate trust, agreed to recognize the AA at the nonunion plants after a <b>token</b> <b>strike</b> in 1899. The formation in March 1900 of the American Sheet Steel Company, another trust, also brought a number of nonunion plants together with unionized facilities. But this time the company refused to recognize the AA in the nonunion plants. Instead, the American Sheet Steel Co. idled its union facilities while keeping its nonunion works running at full speed.|$|E

FORDA has more than 30 government hospitals affiliated to it. A <b>token</b> <b>strike</b> was called on 27th Feb. 2015 under able leadership of Dr. Balvinder. When last strike was called on 22 & 23 June 2015 almost 20000 resident doctors joined in. ESMA was subsequently imposed on 23 June 2015. But that didn't call of the strike unless and until authorities paid heed to their demands.|$|E

5000|$|Like {{many other}} current games, Magna Cum Laude has a free {{exploration}} mode where Larry can walk about campus {{and interact with}} students and personnel on the premises. In this mode, Larry can search for hidden money or <b>tokens,</b> <b>strike</b> poses to impress girls, and take photos which can later be sold to collectors. At several locations on campus a minigame can be entered, usually by [...] "activating" [...] an object or a person (starting a conversation). The player must win most of the minigames in order to advance. Minigames started by a conversation usually increase the affection {{of one of the}} girls; other minigames can provide money or increase [...] "confidence".|$|R
6000|$|We {{naturally}} {{fell into}} a train of reflection as we walked homewards, upon the curious old records of likings and dislikings; of jealousies and revenges; of affection defying the power of death, and hatred pursued beyond the grave, which these depositories contain; silent but <b>striking</b> <b>tokens,</b> some of them, of excellence of heart, and nobleness of soul; melancholy examples, others, of the worst passions of human nature. How many men as they lay speechless and helpless on the bed of death, would have given worlds but for the strength and power to blot out the silent evidence of animosity and bitterness, which now stands registered against them in Doctors’ Commons! ...|$|R

Both the Lawyers National Action Committee (LNAC) and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) quickly denounced the decision as 2 ̆ 2 contradictory 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 against {{the spirit of the}} lawyers 2 ̆ 7 sacrifices. 2 ̆ 2 The provincial bar councils, the high court bar associations and the district bar associations echoed similar sentiments: they insisted on pursuing the strategy of continuous boycott...|$|E
40|$|A {{behavioral}} {{approach to}} teaching {{in the public school}} system is difficult because of the inherent difficulty of finding positive reinforcers and administering them simultaneously to large groups of students. This study attempts to apply the same tangible reinforcers to two groups of students under different schedules of reinforcement. The students in the study were in special classes termed 2 ̆ 2 learning adjustment 2 ̆ 2 classes because of their failure to perform at grade level in regular classroom settings. One group was on a continuous schedule of reinforcement using <b>tokens</b> and gold <b>strike</b> stamps as reinforcers. The second group was also on a continuous schedule of reinforcement but with a punishment contingency added. Reinforcers were the same for this group as the first group. The third group was a comparison group. Performance rates were studied under the above schedules of reinforcement and were found {{to increase the number of}} arithmetic units completed for each group. Achievement level change in mathematics as measured by the mathematics section of the California Achievement Test was a second major aspect of this study. Although there was a very definite difference in the number of arithmetic units completed by the three groups there was not a corresponding difference in the amount of change in achievement level...|$|R
