5|$|Kawasaki's theorem is a theorem in the {{mathematics}} of paper folding {{that describes the}} crease patterns with a single vertex that may be folded to form a flat figure. It states that <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> flat-foldable {{if and only if}} alternatingly adding and subtracting the angles of consecutive folds around the vertex gives an alternating sum of zero.|$|E
5|$|Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TRPM1 gene {{have been}} {{identified}} as closely associated with the LP mutation, although the mechanism by which <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> produced remains unclear. A commercially available DNA based test is likely to be developed in the near future, which breeders can use to determine if LP is present in horses that do not have visible Appaloosa characteristics.|$|E
5|$|A kilim is an Islamic flatwoven carpet (without a pile), {{whether for}} {{household}} use or a prayer mat. <b>The</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> made by winding the weft threads {{back over the}} warp threads when a colour boundary is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical and horizontal threads, curves are difficult to generate, and patterns are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges. Kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions. Kilim motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from wolves.|$|E
40|$|We present control patterns: a {{framework}} for designing and analyzing interorganizational control mechanisms, inspired by design patterns. A control <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> a generic solution for some recurring control problem, applicable in a certain context. <b>The</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> based on internal control theory from the accounting and auditing fields, and on previous work on inter-organizational controls. The application of <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>is</b> supported by <b>the</b> e 3 -control methodology, {{which is based on}} the e 3 -value business modeling tool. <b>The</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> applied in a case study. ...|$|R
50|$|Solving the Gear Cube {{is based}} more {{off of the}} {{observations}} the solver makes. There are only two algorithms needed to solve the cube, so finding <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> a key skill. However, using the algorithms <b>are</b> simple once <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> located.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>was</b> {{field tested}} several times, leading to small changes. <b>The</b> new <b>pattern</b> <b>was</b> {{considered}} to be significantly better than the old M62 and M91 camouflage patterns.|$|R
5|$|Murray cod {{continue}} a pattern present in Murray-Darling native fish genera of speciation into lowland and specialist upland species: Murray cod are the primarily lowland species and the endangered trout cod are the specialist upland species. <b>The</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> slightly blurred in the cod species because, being adaptable and successful fish, Murray cod push significant distances into upland habitats, while the now endangered trout cod stray (or did stray, before their decline) well down the upland/lowland transition zone, {{which can be}} extensive in Murray-Darling Rivers. Nevertheless, the basic pattern of speciation into a primarily lowland species and a specialist upland species is present.|$|E
5|$|The {{reverse of}} countershading, with the belly {{pigmented}} {{darker than the}} back, enhances contrast and so makes animals more conspicuous. It is found in animals that can defend themselves, such as skunks. <b>The</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> used both in startle or deimatic displays and as a signal to warn off experienced predators. However, animals that habitually live upside-down but lack strong defences, like the Nile catfish and the luna moth caterpillar, have upside-down countershading for camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The narrator's tone is {{informal}} and conversational, attempting to conjure {{the picture of}} a dialogue between the reader and the speaker (who is evidently Auden himself, speaking directly in the first person as he does in a large proportion of his work). The informality is established syntactically by enjambment—only 13 of the poem's 93 lines are clearly end-stopped. There are few instances of rhyme, and about half the lines end on unaccented syllables. The lines alternate 13 syllables incorporating five or six accents with 11 syllables and four accents. Auden adapted this syllabic construction from Marianne Moore. <b>The</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> reinforced by the line indentation and confirmed by Auden's own reading. This structure mitigates the tendency of normally accented English speech to fall into the rhythm of iambic pentameter. Swift changes in the sophistication of diction also occur in the poem, as in conversation, and lend it an immediate, informal quality.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>patterns</b> and formats {{constitute}} {{the core of}} the parser, telling it how it should parse files. <b>The</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> mainly based on regular expressions but an additional syntax is added for XML input. <b>The</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> first applied to the log to extract relevant data, then the formats rearrange the groups captured by <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> into <b>the</b> correct order.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the lines}} of <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> {{superimposed}} at <b>the</b> left of the figure, the shift between the lines increase when going to the right. After a given number of lines, <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> opposed: <b>the</b> lines of <b>the</b> second <b>pattern</b> <b>are</b> between <b>the</b> lines of <b>the</b> first <b>pattern.</b> If we look from a far distance, we have the feeling of pale zones when the lines are superimposed (there is white between the lines), and of dark zones when the lines are [...] "opposed".|$|R

25|$|The {{engraving}} {{of copper}} rollers {{is one of}} the most important branches of textile printing and on its perfection of execution depends, in great measure, the ultimate success of the designs. Roughly speaking, the operation of engraving is performed by three different methods, viz. (I) By hand with a graver which cuts the metal away; (2) by etching, in which <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> dissolved out in nitric acid; and (3) by machine, in which <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> simply indented.|$|E

25|$|Within {{countries}} <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> {{that wealth}} is more concentrated around urban areas than rural areas. Wealth also tends towards areas with natural resources or {{in areas that}} are involved in tertiary (service) industries and trade.

25|$|A LEED {{detector}} usually contains {{three or}} four hemispherical concentric grids and a phosphor screen or other position-sensitive detector. The grids are used for screening out the inelastically scattered electrons. Most new LEED systems use a reverse view scheme, which has a minimized electron gun, and <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> viewed from behind through a transmission screen and a viewport. Recently, a new digitized position sensitive detector called a delay-line detector with better dynamic range and resolution has been developed.|$|E
