40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out in anaesthetized rats to compare the {{abilities}} of angiotensin II (A II) and angiotensin III (A III) to reverse the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (<b>Teprotide)</b> on salt and water excretion. In rats infused with <b>Teprotide,</b> significant increases in urine flow and sodium excretion were observed and arterial blood pressure decreased. Addition of A II (10 pmol min- 1) to the <b>Teprotide</b> infusion reduced renal excretion of sodium and water to control values and excretion of potassium to below control. Blood pressure increased to a value significantly higher than that during the control period. In a separate group of rats the natriuretic and diuretic effects of <b>Teprotide</b> were reversed by a similar dose of A III (10 pmol min- 1). A primarily angiotensin-mediated action is indicated for the renal effects of <b>Teprotide.</b> Although angiotensins II and III appeared to be equipotent in their abilities to reverse the renal responses to <b>Teprotide,</b> A II caused an increase in arterial blood pressure that was not seen with A III. In a third group of rats A II (10 pmol min- 1) {{was added to the}} <b>Teprotide</b> infusion and an aortic snare located between the renal arteries was tightened to prevent any increase in left renal perfusion pressure. During this period the rate of sodium excretion from the left kidney was significantly lower than from the right kidney. It is concluded that {{in the absence of any}} accompanying 'pressure natriuresis' A II is more potent than A III in its ability to reverse the natriuretic action of <b>Teprotide.</b> The elevation of blood pressure to above control values by a dose of A II only just sufficient to reverse the Teprotide-induced natriuresis suggests that the concentration of angiotensin in the kidney is higher than in plasma and supports the concept of an intrarenal renin-angiotensin system. In the rat both A II and A III may affect renal salt and water excretion by a combination of mechanisms involving glomerular, vascular and tubular receptors. The possibility is raised that differential effects of the active angiotensins on these mechanisms may participate in the regulation of sodium excretion...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{antiserum}} against human kidney renin and of H- 142, a peptide inhibitor of human renin, were studied in the primate Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset). In severely volume-depleted (low-salt diet and repetitive injections of furosemide), conscious marmosets, the antiserum reduced blood pressure {{to the same extent}} as the converting enzyme inhibitor <b>teprotide</b> (- 31 +/- 7 SEM mmHg and - 30 +/- 5 mmHg). In mildly volume-depleted (normal salt diet and single injection of furosemide), conscious marmosets, H- 142 and <b>teprotide</b> induced a similar fall in blood pressure (- 14 +/- 4 mmHg and - 15 +/- 2 mmHg). When H- 142 was infused after the injection of <b>teprotide,</b> it had no further effect on blood pressure. Conversely, <b>teprotide</b> was ineffective when injected during the infusion of H- 142.

40|$|The {{role of the}} {{renin-angiotensin system}} in the {{regulation}} of the systemic and coronary circulations during sodium depletion was studied in conscious normotensive dogs by i. v. administration of <b>teprotide</b> (0. 5 mg/kg), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and saralasin (0. 05 - 5 μg/kg per min), an angiotensin-receptor antagonist. Sodium depletion was produced by administering a low sodium diet and furosemide for 5 days. Administration of both <b>teprotide</b> and saralasin lowered systemic arterial blood pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance. Simultaneously, cardiac output increased, but left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, dP/dt, and dP/dt/P did not change significantly. Furthermore, both agents reduced diastolic coronary vascular resistance and increased coronary blood flow, but did not affect myocardial oxygen consumption, left ventricular work, or myocardial efficiency. These systemic and coronary vasodilator effects of <b>teprotide</b> and saralasin, however, were not observed in normal dogs on a regular sodium diet; in this group, the only effect noted was {{a slight increase in}} arterial pressure during saralasin infusion. Arterial plasma concentration of norepinephrine did not differ between normal and sodiumdepleted dogs, nor did it change significantly after <b>teprotide</b> administration. These results suggest that, during salt depletion, angiotensin II exerts an active vasoconstrictor action on the systemic and coronary vessels, but has no significant effects on myocardial contractility or energetics. It also appears likely that the increase in cardiac output observed in sodiumdepleted dogs after angiotensin inhibition was caused, at least in part, by the decrease in systemic arterial pressure...|$|E

The remaining 12 dogs served as saline-infused controls. In all dogs, acute coronary occlusion increased plasma renin activity and peripheral vascular resistance and reduced cardiac output, but did not change mean aortic blood pressure significantly. <b>Teprotide</b> significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased peripheral vascular resistance (from 3804 ± 1158 to 2876 ± 816 dyn-sec-cm- 5) (± SD) and mean aortic pressure (from 117 ± 12 to 107 ± 15 mm Hg), and increased cardiac output (from 2. 63 ± 0. 67 to 3. 12 ± 0. 74 I/min). <b>Teprotide</b> also produced a rela-tive increase in flow to the renal and splanchnic circulations compared with the saline-treated controls.

Significant declines in mean arterial pressure (82. 5 ± 4. 9 to 67. 1 4 5. 0 mm Hg [SEM],p < 0. 001), systemic vascular resistance (1787 ± 130 to 1272 i 115 dyn-sec-cm- 5,p < 0. 001) and mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (26. 8 ± 2. 5 to 17. 1 ± 2. 5 mm Hg,p< 0. 001) accompanied improvement in cardiac index (2. 04 4 0. 17 to 2. 47 i 0. 20 I/min/m 2, p < 0. 001). Reduction in mean right atrial pressure (9. 8 4 2. 0 to 5. 2 : 1. 8 mm Hg, p < 0. 005) was not a result of limb venodilation, as calf venous capacitance did not change. The decrease in limb vascular resistance (76. 6 ± 11. 0 to 62. 9 + 10. 7 units, p < 0. 05) did not parallel the fall in systemic vascular resistance in either magnitude or duration (p < 0. 05). Pulmonary arteriolar resistance was not appreciably changed. <b>Teprotide</b> therefore reduces ventricular afterload and significantly improves cardiac function in patients with congestive heart failure.

40|$|The {{angiotensin}} substrate analog Pro-His-Pro-Phe-His-Phe-Phe-Val-Tyr-Lys has {{no significant}} effect on blood pressure in sodium-replete monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) but blocks the pressor response to infused human renin.

In five studies in sodium-depleted monkeys, an infusion of 2 mg of the peptide per kg of body weight resulted in a reduction of mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 105 +/- 4 to 79 +/- 3 mm Hg, which is {{not significantly different from}} the response to 1 mg of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor <b>teprotide</b> per kg.

40|$|SUMMARY In 15 {{patients}} with severe chronic left ventricular failure, plasma renin activity (PRA) ranged widely, from 0. 2 - 39 ng/ml/hr. The level of PRA {{was unrelated to}} cardiac output (CO) or pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PWP), but was slightly negatively correlated with mean arterial pressure (MAP) (r =- 0. 45) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (r =- 0. 40). After infusion of the angiotensin converting enzyme in-hibitor <b>teprotide</b> (SQ 20, 881) PWP fell from 26. 3 ± 1. 3 (SEM) to 20. 3 ± 1. 4 mm Hg (P < 0. 001), CO rose from 3. 94 ± 0. 23 to 4. 75 ± 0. 31 1 /min (P < 0. 001), MAP fell from 87. 5 ± 3. 8 to 77. 9 ± 4. 1 mm Hg (P < 0. 001) and SVR from 1619 ± 148 to 1252 ± 137 dyne-sec-cm- 5 (P < 0. 001). The fall in MAP and in SVR was significantly correlated with control PRA (r = 0. 68 and r = 0. 58, respectively). When subjects were divided {{on the basis of}} control PRA the hemodynamic response to <b>teprotide</b> was greatest in the high renin group. PRA rose after <b>teprotide</b> (8. 7 ± 3. 4 to 37. 9 + 7. 7 ng/ml/hr, P < 0. 05) but plasma norepinephrine fell (619. 1 ± 103. 6 to 449. 7 ± 75. 7, P < 0. 05). The renin-angiotensin system thus appears to have {{an important role in the}} elevated SVR in some {{patients with}} heart failure.

40|$|During the {{induction}} phase of low-renin, one-kidney, one-wrapped hypertension in rabbits,serum {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} (ACE) activity is depressed and correlates inversely with the degree of necrotic arterial disease that develops. Responses to the vasoactive polypeptides, bradykinin (BK), angiotensin I (AI), angiotensin II (AII), the ACE blocker <b>teprotide,</b> and the AII antagonist 1 -sar- 8 -ile AII were studied. Responses to BK, AII, and AI showed significant changes in both magnitude and duration (recovery time). Recovery time for depressor responses to BK in hypertensive rabbits was approximately three times that in the control period. One-wrapped, two-kidney control rabbits without hypertension-associated arterial disease showed no change in BK recovery time, although serum ACE activity was significantly depressed. In the experimental period BK recovery time correlated directly with the degree of arterial disease and indirectly with the final serum ACE activity. Duration of the pressor responses after AII correlated directly with the degree of arterial disease and indirectly with final serum ACE activity. In untreated hypertensive rabbits the percentage of increases in blood pressure after AI relative to control animals were decreased, and for all hypertensive rabbits' the increase in blood pressure correlated directly with the final serum ACE activity. Long-term treatment with <b>teprotide</b> moderated the hypertension but {{had little effect on}} serum ACE activity or the responses to BK, AII, and AI. Short-term infusions of 1 -sar- 8 -ile AII and <b>teprotide</b> caused significant decreases in blood pressure in both the control and experimental periods, although no change in response to either polypeptide occurred. These studies support other evidence that pressor components of the renin-angiotensin system do not sustain the elevation of blood pressure in this form of experimental hypertension. Alterations in response patterns following AII and AI suggest that a vasodepressor system may be altered. In addition, part of the altered response to BK, and possibly AII, appears related {{to the development of the}} hypertension-associated arterial disease...|$|E

The antiserum inhibited the enzymatic activity of renin by 50 % in a dilution of 1 : 45, 000 in marmoset and 1 : 50, 000 in human plasma. The antiserum (0. 2 ml i. v.) decreased blood pressure in conscious marmosets on normal sodium intake by 15 +/- 5 (SD) mmHg and after salt depletion by 31 +/- 13 mmHg. A converting enzyme inhibitor (<b>teprotide,</b> 2 mg X kg- 1 i. v.) induced a comparable fall in blood pressure: - 16 +/- 10 and - 30 +/- 10 mmHg, respectively.

Hypoxia was produced by switching from breathing room air to 5 or 8 % oxygen-nitrogen mixture. Plasma renin activity increased from 2. 3 ± 0. 4 to 4. 9 ± 0. 8 ng/ml per h during 8 % oxygen breathing, and from 2. 8 ± 0. 4 to 8. 4 ± 1. 8 ng/ml per h during 5 % oxygen breathing.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{pattern of}} binding of {{monoclonal}} antibodies (mAbs) to 16 epitopes on human angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) comprise a conformational ACE fingerprint {{and is a}} sensitive marker of subtle protein conformational changes. HYPOTHESIS: Toxic substances {{in the blood of}} patients with uremia due to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) can induce local conformational changes in the ACE protein globule and alter the efficacy of ACE inhibitors. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The recognition of ACE by 16 mAbs to the epitopes on the N and C domains of ACE was estimated using an immune-capture enzymatic plate precipitation assay. The precipitation pattern of blood ACE by a set of mAbs was substantially influenced by the presence of ACE inhibitors with the most dramatic local conformational change noted in the N-domain region recognized by mAb 1 G 12. The "short" ACE inhibitor enalaprilat (tripeptide analog) and "long" inhibitor <b>teprotide</b> (nonapeptide) produced strikingly different mAb 1 G 12 binding with enalaprilat strongly increasing mAb 1 G 12 binding and <b>teprotide</b> decreasing binding. Reduction in S-S bonds via glutathione and dithiothreitol treatment increased 1 G 12 binding to blood ACE in a manner comparable to enalaprilat. Some patients with uremia due to ESRD exhibited significantly increased mAb 1 G 12 binding to blood ACE and increased ACE activity towards angiotensin I accompanied by reduced ACE inhibition by inhibitory mAbs and ACE inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The estimation of relative mAb 1 G 12 binding to blood ACE detects a subpopulation of ESRD patients with conformationally changed ACE, which activity is less suppressible by ACE inhibitors. This parameter may potentially serve as a biomarker for those patients who may need higher concentrations of ACE inhibitors upon anti-hypertensive therapy...|$|E

40|$|We have {{previously}} reported that mannitol strikingly increases {{blood flow to}} rat kidneys hypoperfused at 35 - 40 mm Hg. This vasodilator effect is not due to volume expansion or alterations in plasma osmolality. We have tested {{the hypothesis that the}} vasodilatory effect of mannitol in the ischemic rat kidney is mediated by one of the vasoactive renal hormone systems: renin-angiotension, kallikrein-kinin, or prostaglandins. Rats were infused with 5 % mannitol in 0. 9 % saline to 3 - 5 % of body weight. In agreement with our previous studies, RBF increased 1. 3 +/- 0. 1 ml/min despite maintenance of perfusion pressure at 35 - 40 mm Hg. The cyclooxygenase inhibitors, meclofenamate and indomethacin had no effect on renal blood flow (RBF) in hypoperfused kidneys. However, in rats pretreated with these inhibitors, expansion with mannitol increased RBF by only 0. 37 +/- 0. 02 ml/min, 28 % of the response in the untreated group (p less than 0. 001). Infusion of prostacyclin (PGI 2) into the renal artery during reduced perfusion resulted in an increase in RBF of 1. 0 +/- 0. 1 ml/min. Subsequent expansion with mannitol increased RBF by only 0. 5 +/- 0. 1 ml/min more, less than one-half of the effect of mannitol in a concurrent group of rats not treated with PGI 2. Unlike PGI 2 prostaglandin E 2 had only a minimal vasodilator effect during hyperperfusion. Imidazole, an inhibitor of thromboxane synthesis, did not alter RBF or renal vascular resistance during hypoperfusion. Treatment of rats during hypoperfusion. with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (kininase II) inhibitor <b>teprotide</b> increased RBF by 1. 1 +/- 0. 3 ml/min. However, <b>teprotide</b> did not alter the vascular response to mannitol: RBF increased 1. 2 +/- 0. 1 ml/min more when mannitol was infused into teprotide-treated rats. The renal vascular response to mannitol was not altered by treatment with aprotinin, an inhibitor of the kallikrein-kinin system. Aprotinin was ineffective whether given before or after the vascular response to mannitol was established. We conclude that the vasodilator response to mannitol in the ischemic rat kidney is mediated in large part by increased prostaglandin (PGI 2) activity. The failure of converting enzyme inhibition and aprotinin to block the vasodilator response to mannitol is evidence against a role for the renin-angiotension or kallikreinkinin systems in mediating the vasodilator response...|$|E

Captopril, in doses of 25 to 150 mg p. o. TID, maintains its efficacy during chronic administration with persistent clinical and hemodynamic improvement as well as increased exercise tolerance. In our experience, enalapril, 10 mg p. o., improves cardiac function within 4 to 6 h as reflected by a 30 % decrease in left ventricular filling pressure, a 28 % increase in stroke volume {{in the face of}} unchanged heart rate. Clinical improvement, enhanced exercise tolerance and characteristic hormonal responses suggest that enalapril also maintains its efficacy during long-term treatment. Chronic angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibition appears to be a major advance in the treatment of patients with severe congestive heart failure, refractory to digitalis and diuretic...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The {{effects of}} acute {{renovascular}} hypertension on the sympathetic nervous system, regional blood flow and cardiac function were studied in conscious dogs submitted to renal artery occlusion by inflation of a cuff implanted previously around one renal artery. We then compared the alterations in plasma renin and catecholamine levels {{and in the}} various hemodynamic parameters induced by those maneuvers in intact dogs, to those in dogs pretreated with a- and /?-adrenergic receptor blockers. Subsequently, the converting enzyme inhibitor <b>teprotide</b> was administered to inhibit angiotensin formation in both experiments. Our results suggest that both the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic system contribute to the rise in blood pressure. The hemodynamic changes and alterations in regional blood flows accompanying this acute hypertension appear to be due mostly {{to the increase in}} plasma angiotensin, since prior adrenoceptor blockade only attenuated their magnitude but did not alter their direction. However, angiotensin-induced coronary vasoconstriction was observed only in adrenergically blocked but not intact animals, probably because of the protective effect of baroreceptor-mediated reflex sympathetic coronary vasodilation.

40|$|A bstract. Chronic {{potassium}} deficiency in the rat {{results in a}} decrease in the pressor sensitivity to ex-ogenous angiotensin II (All). To define the mechanism of this resistance to All, studies were performed in con-scious rats after 14 - 21 d of dietary {{potassium deficiency}}. The pressor response to graded doses of All was 50 % less in potassium-deficient than control animals. In contrast, the pressor response to graded doses of norepinephrine was preserved in potassium-deficient rats; therefore, the decreased response to All was not due to a generalized defect in vascular reactivity. Pretreatment with either the converting enzyme inhibitor, <b>teprotide,</b> or the prosta-glandin synthesis inhibitor, indomethacin, failed to nor-malize the response to All. Thus, neither prior receptor occupancy with endogenous All nor the presence of va-sodilatory prostaglandins caused the decreased All re-sponse in potassium deficiency. Since the pressor response to All involves angiotensin interaction with its vascular receptor, binding studies of mesenteric artery and uterine smooth muscle All receptors were performed. Scatchard analysis showed that potassium deficiency resulted in a decrease in binding affinity (50 % increase in Kd) in both uterine (6. 00 vs. 3. 82 nM; P < 0. 05) and vascular (1. 39 vs. 0. 973 nM; P < 0. 005) smooth muscle. Furthermore, despite increased circulating All, there was an increas...|$|E
40|$|Endopeptidase- 24. 11 (EC 3. 4. 24. 11), {{purified}} to homogeneity from pig kidney, {{was shown}} to hydrolyse {{a wide range of}} neuropeptides, including enkephalins, tachykinins, bradykinin, neurotensin, luliberin and cholecystokinin. The sites of hydrolysis of peptides were identified, indicating that the primary specificity is consistent with hydrolysis occurring at bonds involving the amino group of hydrophobic amino acid residues. Of the substrates tested, the amidated peptide substance P is hydrolysed the most efficiently (Km = 31. 9 microM; kcat. = 5062 min- 1). A free alpha-carboxy group at the C-terminus of a peptide substrate is therefore not essential for efficient hydrolysis by the endopeptidase. A large variation in kcat. /Km values was observed among the peptide substrates studied, a finding that reflects a significant influence of amino acid residues, remote from the scissile bond, on the efficiency of hydrolysis. These subsite interactions between peptide substrate and enzyme thus confer some degree of functional specificity on the endopeptidase. The inhibition of endopeptidase- 24. 11 by several compounds was compared with that of pig kidney peptidyldipeptidase A (EC 3. 4. 15. 1). Of the inhibitors examined, only N-[1 (R,S) -carboxy- 2 -phenylethyl]-Phe-p-aminobenzoate inhibited endopeptidase- 24. 11 but not peptidyldipeptidase. Captopril (D- 3 -mercapto- 2 -methylpropanoyl-L-proline), <b>Teprotide</b> (pGlu-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro) and MK 422 [N-[(S) - 1 -carboxy- 3 -phenylpropyl]-L-Ala-L-Pro] were highly selective as inhibitors of peptidyldipeptidase. Although not wholly specific, phosphoramidon was a more potent inhibitor of endopeptidase- 24. 11 than were any of the synthetic compounds tested...|$|E
40|$|Acute hemorrhagic {{ulceration}} of the gastric mucosa is seen {{frequently in}} patients with hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock. Although such lesions clearly are related to regional gastric ischemia, {{little attention has been}} directed at the underlying mechanism(s) mediating the ischemia itself. To this end, anesthetized pigs were subjected to sustained cardiogenic shock (mild hemorrhage and pericardial tamponade) such that cardiac output was reduced to 38 +/- 1 % of the baseline level for 4 hours, followed by release of the tamponade, reinfusion of the shed blood, and resuscitation for 2 hours. During the period of shock, there was profound regional gastric ischemia, resulting from severe and disproportionate gastric vasoconstriction. "Blinded" gross and microscopic evaluation of the stomachs removed after the experiment revealed severe mucosal ischemic necrosis, hemorrhage, and ulceration, whereas sham-operated pigs showed no lesions. The characteristics of this model therefore mimic the essential features of the gastric "stress ulceration" syndrome. Prior confirmed total alpha-adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine failed to alter these features significantly. In contrast, prior ablation of the renin-angiotensin axis, whether by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with <b>teprotide</b> or by bilateral nephrectomy, significantly and substantially ameliorated the ischemia, vasospasm, and mucosal injury. In this model of cardiogenic shock, acute gastric mucosal "stress ulceration" is caused by a disproportionately severe regional gastric ischemia resulting from selective splanchnic vasospasm that is unaffected by sympathetic blockade but abolished by prior ablation of the renin-angiotensin axis. Like nonocclusive small bowel ischemia, ischemic colitis, and the "shock liver" syndrome, gastric "stress ulceration" is yet another component of the multiple splanchnic organ failure syndrome that appears to be mediated primarily by the remarkable sensitivity of the splanchnic vascular bed to the renin-angiotensin axis...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{potassium}} deficiency in the rat {{results in a}} decrease in the pressor sensitivity to exogenous angiotensin II (AII). To define the mechanism of this resistance to AII, studies were performed in conscious rats after 14 - 21 d of dietary {{potassium deficiency}}. The pressor response to graded doses of AII was 50 % less in potassium-deficient than control animals. In contrast, the pressor response to graded doses of norepinephrine was preserved in potassium-deficient rats; therefore, the decreased response to AII was not due to a generalized defect in vascular reactivity. Pretreatment with either the converting enzyme inhibitor, <b>teprotide,</b> or the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, indomethacin, failed to normalize the response to AII. Thus, neither prior receptor occupancy with endogenous AII nor the presence of vasodilatory prostaglandins caused the decreased AII response in potassium deficiency. Since the pressor response to AII involves angiotensin interaction with its vascular receptor, binding studies of mesenteric artery and uterine smooth muscle AII receptors were performed. Scatchard analysis showed that potassium deficiency resulted in a decrease in binding affinity (50 % increase in Kd) in both uterine (6. 00 vs. 3. 82 nM; P less than 0. 05) and vascular (1. 39 vs. 0. 973 nM; P less than 0. 005) smooth muscle. Furthermore, despite increased circulating AII, there was an increase in AII receptor number in potassium-deficient uterine (308 vs. 147 fmol/mg protein; P less than 0. 005) and vascular (470 vs. 316 fmol/mg protein; 0. 05 less than P less than 0. 1) smooth muscle. Although potassium deficiency resulted in alterations in receptor-binding parameters, the changes in binding affinity and number were directionally opposite, so that in potassium deficiency there was either no change or an increase in total AII binding. We conclude that the decrease in angiotensin pressor sensitivity in potassium-deficient rats is mediated by a postreceptor defect since it occurs subsequent to the binding of AII to its vascular smooth muscle receptor...|$|E
