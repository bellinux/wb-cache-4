5|$|That {{part of the}} {{restoration}} in the Sistine Chapel which has caused the most concern is the ceiling, painted by Michelangelo. The emergence of the brightly coloured Ancestors of Christ from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe. Despite warnings, {{the work on the}} ceiling proceeded and, according to critics such as James Beck, their worst fears were confirmed once <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> completed.|$|E
5|$|All Stuka {{units were}} moved to Germany's eastern border in {{preparation}} for the invasion of Poland. On the morning of 15 August 1939, during a mass-formation dive-bombing demonstration for high-ranking commanders of the Luftwaffe at Neuhammer training grounds near Sagan, 13 Ju 87s and 26 crew members were lost when they crashed into the ground almost simultaneously. The planes dived through cloud, expecting to release their practice bombs and pull out of the dive once below the cloud ceiling, unaware that on that particular day <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> too low and unexpected ground mist formed, leaving them no time {{to pull out of the}} dive.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year 1506, Pope Julius {{conceived}} a program to paint {{the ceiling of the}} Sistine Chapel. The walls of the chapel had been decorated twenty years earlier. The lowest of three levels is painted to resemble draped hangings and was (and sometimes still is) hung on special occasions with the set of tapestries designed by Raphael. The middle level contains a complex scheme of frescoes illustrating the Life of Christ on the right side and the Life of Moses on the left side. It was carried out by some of the most renowned Renaissance painters: Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Pinturicchio, Signorelli and Cosimo Rosselli. The upper level of the walls contains the windows, between which are painted pairs of illusionistic niches with representations of the first thirty-two popes. A draft by Matteo d'Amelia indicates that <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> painted blue like that of the Arena Chapel and decorated with gold stars, possibly representing the zodiacal constellations. It is probable that, because the chapel was the site of regular meetings and Masses of an elite body of officials known as the Papal Chapel who would observe the decorations and interpret their theological and temporal significance, it was Pope Julius' intention and expectation that the iconography of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> to be read with many layers of meaning.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the building, with arches, pilasters, garlands and ornaments, which is visible from Beauford Square, was designed by George Dance the Younger who also designed the decorative sections of the interior. The main fabric of the building was by John Palmer, who supervised the construction. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> decorated with panels from Fonthill Splendens, a mile from Fonthill Abbey, which were painted by Andrea Casali and donated to the theatre by Paul Cobb Methuen. Because of the potential damage from the gas lights, which were installed in 1827, the paintings were moved by William Blathwayt to Dyrham Park.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} types of wood that have been {{positively}} identified: teak (Tectona grandis) {{was used for the}} through-beams and is resilient to the teredo worm (the Teredinidae family), <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> made from a Cupressus genus which was possibly Cupressus torulosa, the stem-post is made of rosewood from the Leguminosae family (now called the Fabaceae) and either the Dalbergia or Pterocarpus genus. The wooden box found in the stern area of the shipwreck was made from an Artocarpus genus of the family Moraceae, more commonly known as the Mulberry family.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> made {{of plywood}} panels which {{emphasize}} the angles {{of the fan}} roof, blurring the line between interior and exterior space within the site. The crosses on <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>were</b> designed by Philip Harmer and Andrew Ferguson, of Stained Glass Art, and were made handmade or mouth-blown stained glass. The only source of electronic light in the space are security lights.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> of <b>the</b> {{entrance}} porch features coffers. The oblong panels bordering <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>are</b> {{carved with}} figures of dancers and musicians.|$|R

5|$|All {{flights in}} and out of the Cabo San Lucas, La Paz, Los Cabos, and Loreto {{airports}} were cancelled on September15. A terminal roof at the Los Cabos was detached and <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> partially destroyed. As a result, approximately 3,000-4,000people aboard 44flights were stranded. Although the interior walls of the airport in La Paz sustained damage, the airport resumed normal operations within a week following Odile. Throughout the peninsula, 30,000vacationers were stranded, including 26,000 from other nations, mainly from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Many of the stranded were evacuated to shelters, though one of the shelters collapsed due to overcrowding. By September16, many tourists were airlifted to surrounding airports, including Tijuana, Mazatlán, Guadalajara, and Mexico City, although one person perished on a flight back via a heart attack due to stress the storm created.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{were unable}} to enter the silos as OSHA ruled them to be too {{hazardous}} after the explosion. They were only able to access the area after the silos were demolished. By the time this took place, {{four months after the}} disaster, investigators believed that the explosion started in a basement area beneath the silos, from which sugar was fed up to the packaging building on conveyor belts. The factory's outdated construction materials and methods are believed to have contributed to the severity of the blaze. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> of wooden tongue and groove design. The creosote used throughout was known as “fat lighter,” because of the fire risk it posed. Interviews of Imperial Sugar employees conducted by OSHA uncovered a lack of training, as 40 of the workers reported never receiving training on how to exit the building in an emergency. Only five employees recalled having a fire drill.|$|E
5|$|Kirchherr {{asked the}} Beatles {{if they would}} mind letting her take {{photographs}} {{of them in a}} photo session, which impressed them, as other groups had only snapshots that were taken by friends. The next morning Kirchherr took photographs with a Rolleicord camera, at a fairground in a municipal park called Hamburger Dom which was close to the Reeperbahn, and in the afternoon she took them all (minus Best, who decided not to go) to her mother's house in Altona. Kirchherr's bedroom (which was all in black, including the furniture, with silver foil on the walls and a large tree branch suspended from <b>the</b> <b>ceiling),</b> <b>was</b> decorated especially for Voormann, with whom she had a relationship, although after the visits to the Kaiserkeller their relationship became purely platonic. Kirchherr started dating Sutcliffe, although she always remained a close friend of Voormann.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, <b>the</b> lobby <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> {{restored}} to its former glory by Evergreene Architectural Arts. The frescoes on <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>were</b> based on Raphael's frescoes in Cardinal Bibbienna's Loggetta at the Vatican Palace.

5|$|Rook Lane Chapel was a noncomformist chapel built between 1705 and 1707 by James Pope. The chapel had {{a gallery}} around three sides and {{the centre of}} <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> domed and {{supported}} by two Tuscan columns. Rook Lane ceased {{to be used as}} a chapel in 1968 and there followed twenty-five years of neglect. In the early 1990s the building was compulsorily purchased by Somerset County Council and transferred to the Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust, which carried out repairs and restorations. In 2001 it was converted by a firm of architects, the ground floor becoming a community hall and arts centre managed by Rook Lane Arts Trust and the galleried upper floor becoming offices for the architectural firm NVB Architects.|$|E
5|$|In 1684, the government, through Governor General Gabriel Curuscalegui, {{approved}} {{the collection of}} a tribute for five years {{for the sole purpose}} of constructing a stone church. The foundation was laid in 1732 during the term of Father Fernando Haro, but it burned down in 1739. It was begun again, and the construction of the church finished in 1767 with the addition of a tower in 1777. The image of Our Lady of Turumba was unveiled in 1788. In 1840, Father Joaquin de Coria repaired the church, but because of a fire in 1851 which ravaged most of the town, Father Juan de Llanera fixed the damages to the church the following year. Father Juan de Dios de Villayos rebuilt the church roof and bell tower after it was damaged by an earthquake in 1881, and the church was rebuilt again in 1883 by Father Paulino Camba. Damaged by the earthquake of 1937, it was repaired again by Father Federico Diaz Pines with the help of the Confederation of United Catholics (Kapisanang Unidad Catolica). During World War II, the church suffered damage and was later renovated. A major repair was done from 1980 to 1984, when a story of the bell tower was rebuilt and <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> renovated under the Parish Council of the Laity.|$|E
5|$|The {{first floor}} of the {{building}} was built as a grand 1,200-seat auditorium with a proscenium stage, and meeting rooms dedicated to student organizations. The second floor consisted of a U-shaped balcony and the Old Council Room, a gathering space for smaller organizations. The Old Council Room was repainted in 1945 as part of a minor renovation of the building that also included the opening of a student eatery called The Hoot on the west side. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> made from decorated plaster and dentils evoked the exterior neoclassical architectural style. The basement housed several offices and later a bicycle exchange, used bookshop, and student storage space. After the 1973 renovation, dishwashing equipment for the ACDC was housed upstairs, along with staff offices. The 2003 renovation saw the removal of this dishwashing equipment; instead, the second upstairs was repurposed as a multifunctional student space, in line with the original intentions for the building. The second story—called UpC—is now an open space capable of seating 600 people when chairs are added; it also features multimedia equipment and a third-floor mezzanine that, until 2015, housed the UpC Cafe.|$|E

25|$|The main {{hall was}} further renovated {{throughout}} the entire 12th century. The entire outer wall structure was eventually replaced. Around the year 1200, <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> replaced with a ribbed vault, a rather new technique for the time.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, various {{refurbishment}} projects {{took place}} within the chapel. Most significantly, <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> restored to its former Bodlian watercolour design, the original having been painted over in the 1960s due to deterioration. At the same time, the interior walls were redecorated and the stonework cleaned.|$|E
25|$|Before 1907 the Jayhawks {{played in}} various venues, {{ranging from the}} {{basement}} of the original Snow Hall (even though <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> only 14 feet high) to the skating rink at the local YMCA.

A border of acanthus, scrollwork, and egg-and-dart moldings bordered the section. On the narrow ends of the room were smaller sections, similarly decorated.|$|E
25|$|The {{walls and}} ceiling of the church were built from stone and white mortar. The stones of which Saint John the Baptist was built were brought from nearby Mount Matean. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> arched but the roof surface was {{elevated}} because the outside walls were built to {{the same level as}} topmost of the arched ceiling so that walls and roof meet at same level outside.|$|E
25|$|At {{the center}} of the {{transverse}} corridor, the staircase led to a chapel with five niches. This chapel had an alabaster floor, a dado of pink granite and splendidly decorated limestone walls, {{with the exception of the}} niches in the west wall and the dado. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> adorned with stars. The niches housed cult statues of the king, none of which has survived to this day.|$|E
