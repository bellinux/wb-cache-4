Neste trabalho foi avaliado se a a????o deste ester??ide est?? relacionada ?? ativa????o do receptor de vitamina D (VDR), que ?? um fator de transcri????o ativado pela vitamina D 3. Inicialmente foi realizado um ensaio de transloca????o do VDR utilizando c??lulas COS- 7 transfectadas com plasm??deo codificante para a prote??na de fus??o YFP-VDR, formada pelo VDR associado ?? prote??na fluorescente amarela. As c??lulas transfectadas foram tratadas com 100 ??M da fisalina F e tamb??m da fisalina D, que n??o possui atividade imunossupressora, dexametasona e vitamina D 3. Observou-se por microscopia de fluoresc??ncia o mesmo padr??o de transloca????o do VDR do citoplasma para o n??cleo em c??lulas tratadas com a fisalina F e com a vitamina D 3, mas n??o com dexametasona ou fisalina D. Para comprovar a atividade do VDR como fator de transcri????o sob a????o da fisalina F, c??lulas COS- 7 foram transfectadas com pTA-LUC (plasm??deo controle) ou pVDR-LUC que codifica a prote??na luciferase sob o controle de elementos responsivos ao VDR. Ap??s a transfec????o, as c??lulas foram incubadas com os mesmos est??mulos e na mesma concentra????o do ensaio de transloca????o ou apenas com ve??culo. As atividades da luciferase nos grupos tratados com fisalina F e vitamina D 3 foram semelhantes e tamb??m superiores ??s do grupo tratado com ve??culo, fisalina D e dexametasona. Foi realizada a express??o do VDR em Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3) Rosetta utilizando o plasm??deo HS_VDR_EC 1 -pQE-T 7, o qual codifica o VDR associado a uma cauda de 6 histidinas.

Em conclus??o, nossos resultados sugerem que a fisalina F interage com o VDR e que as atividades destas fisalinas podem ser atribu??das, ao menos em parte, ?? ativa????o deste receptor nuclear. Physalins are secosteroids isolated from {{species of the}} genus Physalis endowed with several biological activities. Studies in vitro and in models of immune-mediated diseases have shown that physalin F has potent immunosuppressive activity independent of the glucocorticoid receptor. {{in this study we}} evaluated whether the action of this steroid is related to activation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is a transcription factor activated by vitamin D 3. Initially we evaluated the translocation of the VDR using COS- 7 cells transfected with plasmid encoding a fusion protein YFP-VDR formed by VDR associated with yellow fluorescent protein. The transfected cells were treated with 100 ??M of physalins F and D, dexamethasone, and vitamin D 3. We observed by fluorescence microscopy the translocation of VDR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in cells treated with physalin F and with vitamin D 3, but not with dexamethasone or physalin D. To prove the transcription factor activity of VDR under the action of physalin F, COS- 7 cells were transfected with PTA-LUC (plasmid control) or pVDR-LUC that encodes the protein luciferase under de control of VDR responsive elements. After transfection, cells were incubated with vehicle or physalins F and D, dexamethasone and vitamin D 3 at the same concentration of <b>translocation</b> <b>test.</b> The luciferase activity of cells treated with vitamin D 3 and physalin F were similar, and higher than group treated with vehicle, dexamethasone or physalin D. The VDR expression was done in Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3) Rosetta. For this, we used the plasmid PQE-HS_VDR_EC 1 -T 7, which encodes the VDR protein associated with a tail of 6 histidines. Under the conditions tested, the expressed protein was in inclusion bodies. This purified protein can be used in future studies of interaction between VDR and physalins. Our results suggest that physalin F interacts with the VDR and the activities of this physalin can be attributed at least in part to activation of this nuclear receptor...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Pseudomonas fluorescens {{has long}} been {{considered}} as a psychrotrophic microorganism. Recently, we have shown that clinical strains of P. fluorescens (biovar 1) are able to adapt {{at a growth temperature}} of 37 °C or above and induce a specific inflammatory response. Interestingly, a highly specific antigen of P. fluorescens, I 2, is detected in the serum of patients with Crohn's disease but the possible role of this bacterium in the disease has not yet been explored. In the present study, we examined the ability of a psychrotrophic and a clinical strain of P. fluorescens to modulate the permeability of a Caco- 2 /TC 7 intestinal epithelial model, reorganize the actin cytoskeleton, invade the target cells and translocate across the epithelium. The behaviour of these two strains was compared to that of the well known opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa PAO 1. Results Both strains of P. fluorescens were found to decrease the transepithelial resistance (TER) of Caco- 2 /TC 7 differentiated monolayers. This was associated with an increase in paracellular permeability and F-actin microfilaments rearrangements. Moreover, the invasion and <b>translocation</b> <b>tests</b> demonstrated that the two strains used in this study can invade and translocate across the differentiated Caco- 2 /TC 7 cell monolayers. Conclusions The present work shows for the first time, that P. fluorescens is able to alter the intestinal epithelial barrier function by disorganizing the F-actin microfilament network. Moreover, we reveal that independently of their origins, the two P. fluorescens strains can translocate across differentiated Caco- 2 /TC 7 cell monolayers by using the transcellular pathway. These findings could, at least in part, explain the presence of the P. fluorescens specific I 2 antigen in the serum of patients with Crohn's disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas syringae translocates {{virulence}} effector proteins into plant cells via a type III secretion system (T 3 SS) encoded by hrp (for {{hypersensitive response}} and pathogenicity) genes. Three genes coregulated with the Hrp T 3 SS system in P. syringae pv. tomato DC 3000 have predicted lytic transglycosylase domains: PSPTO 1378 (here designated hrpH), PSPTO 2678 (hopP 1), and PSPTO 852 (hopAJ 1). hrpH is located between hrpR and avrE 1 in the Hrp pathogenicity island and is {{carried in the}} functional cluster of P. syringae pv. syringae 61 hrp genes cloned in cosmid pHIR 11. Strong expression of DC 3000 hrpH in Escherichia coli inhibits bacterial growth unless the predicted catalytic glutamate at position 148 is mutated. <b>Translocation</b> <b>tests</b> involving C-terminal fusions with a Cya (Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase) reporter indicate that HrpH and HopP 1, but not HopAJ 1, are T 3 SS substrates. Pseudomonas fluorescens carrying a pHIR 11 derivative lacking hrpH is poorly able to translocate effector HopA 1, and this deficiency can be restored by HopP 1 and HopAJ 1, but not by HrpH(E 148 A) or HrpH 1 - 241. DC 3000 mutants lacking hrpH or hrpH, hopP 1, and hopAJ 1 combined are variously reduced in effector translocation, elicitation of the hypersensitive response, and virulence. However, the mutants are not reduced in secretion of T 3 SS substrates in culture. When produced in wild-type DC 3000, the HrpH(E 148 A) and HrpH 1 - 241 variants have a dominant-negative effect {{on the ability of}} DC 3000 to elicit the hypersensitive response in nonhost tobacco and to grow and cause disease in host tomato.

40|$|Simultaneous {{receiving}} of NNSS satellites {{was made}} at the three stations, Tsukuba, Dodaira and Tokyo during 19 - 26 May 1984 and performance of <b>translocation</b> was <b>tested</b> with changed combination of reference points. The Cartesian coordinates of these receiving points are determined within 2 m error in each axis by the precise ephemeris point-positioning and the test is made by estimating the radial offset between the translocation solution point and the above-specified standard point. Since the translocaiton {{is based on the}} broadcast ephemeris system and the standard points are in the precise ephemeris system, coordinate transform is required before direct comparison of the station coordinates. Tests showed that LeRoy 2 ̆ 7 s transform formula is appropriate in the region concerned, though 1. 5 - 2. 0 m transform discrepancy has to be considered. Since the translocation is a relative positioning technique of one station with respect to the other reference point, the error in the reference point may affect on the accuracy of <b>translocation</b> solution. <b>Tests</b> showed that when the "bug station" with large coordinate errors was used as the reference point, the involved errors transferred to the coordinates of the translocation solution point. It is thus imoprtant to use the reference point which is determined as accurate as possible. When the translocation is made relative to thus determined standard point, the convergence of the translocation solution can be obtained with a smaller number of satellite passes. The necessary passes to maintain 5 m absolute accuracy including uncertainty in the coordinate transform are found to be reduced under 10; the number is about one-fourth of the necessary passes for the same convergence in case of broadcast ephemeris point-positioning. The operational difficulty in the Antarctic field research programs may be lightened because staying time at one receiving site will be reduced within 24 h by an application of translocation technique...|$|R

To clarify the role of ATP in mhsp 70 -driven <b>translocation,</b> we <b>tested</b> {{the effect of the}} purified ATP analogues AMP-PNP and ATP gamma S on the Tim 44 -mhsp 70 interaction. Both analogues mimicked ATP by causing dissociation of mhsp 70 from Tim 44. ADP did not disrupt the Tim 44 -mhsp 70 complex, but did block the ATP-induced dissociation of this complex. In the presence of ADP, mhsp 70 can bind simultaneously to Tim 44 and to a peptide substrate. These data are consistent with a model in which mhsp 70 first hydrolyzes ATP, then associates tightly with Tim 44 and a precursor protein, and finally undergoes a conformational change to drive translocation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTranslocations of proto-oncogenes to the B-cell or T-cell antigen {{receptor}} loci in acute T- or B-cell leukemia and lymphoma have been, in most cases, accredited to V(D) J or switch recombination {{depending on the}} location of the breakpoint at the receptor locus. Only in rare instances, the reports take into account mechanistic characteristics of the translocation mechanism. To assess the functional ability of several sites implicated in supposedly V(D) J-mediated <b>translocations,</b> we <b>tested</b> five sites at four proto-oncogene loci in an ex vivo recombination substrate assay for their potential to act as direct target for V(D) J recombination. Our results show that the LMO 2 /RBTN 2 /TTG 2 site and one LCK/P 56 site readily engage in recombination with a genuine TCR element with the majority of breakpoint junctions showing the characteristics of V(D) J recombination, which strongly supports the involvement of this mechanism in the pathogenesis of the corresponding translocations in vivo. The site at the TLX 1 /HOX 11 locus yielded 0. 8 % V(D) J-specific junctions. Sites at the LCK/P 56 and TCF 3 /E 2 A proto-oncogenes resulted in exclusively unspecific breakpoints scattered over part of or the entire proto-oncogene region tested, marking them as unlikely V(D) J recombination targets.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the impacts of}} Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) ova on the tight junction barriers in a trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) -induced colitis model. METHODS: Balb/c mice were randomly divided into three groups: control group; TNBS+ova- group and TNBS+ova+ group. TNBS was used intracolonic to induce colitis and mice of the TNBS+ova+ group were pre-exposed to S. japonicum ova as a prophylactic intervention. Colon inflammation was quantified using following variables: mouse mortality, weight loss, colon extent and microscopic inflammation score. Serum expression of tumor necrosis factor-&#x 3 B 1; and interferon-&#x 3 B 3; were assessed to {{evaluate the}} systemic inflammatory response. NOD 2 and its mRNA were also <b>tested.</b> Bacterial <b>translocations</b> were <b>tested</b> by culturing blood and several tissues. ZO- 1 and occludin were chosen as the representations of tight junction proteins. Both the proteins and mRNA were assessed. RESULTS: Ova pre-treatment contributed to the relief of colitis and decreased the mortality of the models. NOD 2 expression was significantly downregulated when pretreated with the ova. The TNBS injection caused a significant downregulation of ZO- 1 and occludin mRNA together with their proteins in the colon; ova pre-exposure reversed these alterations. Treatment with S. japonicum ova in the colitis model caused lower intestinal bacterial translocation frequency. CONCLUSION: S. japonicum ova can maintain epithelial barrier function through increasing tight junction proteins, thus causing less exposure of NOD 2 to the luminal antigens which may activate a series of inflammatory factors and induce colitis...|$|R

We analyzed these two lots for PCB congeners, polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), and polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs). We used previously established techniques for analyzing intracellular Ca 2 + buffering and protein kinase C (PKC) <b>translocation</b> to <b>test</b> their biologic activity in neuronal preparations. PCB congener-specific analysis indicated that ortho and non-ortho congeners in these two lots varied in their percent contribution.

In cell population studies using mathematical modeling and functional analyses, Cheng et al. suggested that LPS-driven activation of MyD 88, {{in the absence}} of TRIF, impairs NF-κB <b>translocation.</b> We <b>tested</b> the model proposed by Cheng et al. using real-time single cell analysis in macrophages expressing EGFP-tagged p 65 and a TNFα promoter-driven mCherry. Following LPS stimulation, cells lacking TRIF show a pattern of NF-κB dynamics that is unaltered from wild-type cells, but activation of the TNFα promoter is impaired. In macrophages lacking MyD 88, there is minimal NF-κB translocation to the nucleus in response to LPS stimulation, and there is no activation of the TNFα promoter. These findings confirm that signalling through MyD 88 is the primary driver for LPS-dependent NF-κB translocation to the nucleus. The pattern of NF-κB dynamics in TRIF-deficient cells does not, however, directly reflect the kinetics of TNFα promoter activation, supporting the concept that TRIF-dependent signalling {{plays an important role in}} the transcription of this cytokine.

Mutant cells with these changes were incapable of growth via oxidative phosphorylation on succinate. An Asp- 61 [...] Glu mutant grew on succinate but at 50 % the efficiency of wild type. Hence, even minor changes in the position of the carboxyl group can significantly reduce function. In a second approach, slow-growing revertants to an Asp- 61 [...] Gly mutant were isolated. In one such revertant, Ala- 24 was changed to Asp, while the original Asp- 61 [...] Gly mutation remained unchanged. The Asp- 24 -Gly- 61 double mutant grew on succinate at 60 % the efficiency of wild type. Hence the essential carboxyl group of subunit c can function when anchored at either position 24 or position 61, and this supports the idea that these residues may neighbor each other when subunit c is folded in the membrane. The rate of ATP-driven H+ translocation by mutant membrane vesicles was estimated by the quenching of 9 -amino- 6 -chloro- 2 -methoxyacridine fluorescence and corresponded to actual H+ pumping rates less than 25 % that of wild type...|$|R

Besides its high level of amino acid homology (75 %) with the Na,K-ATPase, the colonic H,K-ATPase also shares a common pharmacological profile with Na,K-ATPase, because both are ouabain-sensitive and Sch 28080 -insensitive. These features raise the possibility that an unrecognized property of the colonic H,K-ATPase would be Na+ <b>translocation.</b> To <b>test</b> this hypothesis, ion-selective microelectrodes were {{used to measure the}} intracellular Na+ activity of X. laevis oocytes expressing various combinations of P-ATPase subunits. The results show that expression in oocytes of the colonic H,K-ATPase affects intracellular Na+ homeostasis in a way similar to the expression of the Bufo marinus Na,K-ATPase; intracellular Na+ activity is lower in oocytes expressing the colonic H,K-ATPase or the B. marinus Na,K-ATPase than in oocytes expressing the gastric H,K-ATPase or a β subunit alone. In oocytes expressing the colonic H,K-ATPase, the decrease in intracellular Na+ activity persists when diffusive Na+ influx is enhanced by functional expression of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel, suggesting that the decrease is related to increased active Na+ efflux. The Na+ decrease depends on the presence of K+ in the external medium and is inhibited by 2 mM ouabain, a concentration that inhibits the colonic H,K-ATPase. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the colonic H,K-ATPase may transport Na+, acting as an (Na,H),K-ATPase.

These results demonstrate, for the first time, the refolding activity of Ssa 1 / 2 p {{in the context of the}} yeast cytosol, and define refolding activity as a chaperone function specific to Ssa 1 / 2 p, aprt from other cytosolic hsp 70 s. They also suggest that Ssa 1 / 2 p do not play a significant role in chaperoning the folding of nascent polypeptides. The implications of these findings for Ssa 1 / 2 p activity on their proposed role in the process of translocation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The term "position effect" is {{used when}} the {{expression}} of a gene is deleteriously affected by an alteration in its chromosomal environment even though the integrity of the protein coding sequences is maintained. We describe a patient affected by epilepsy and severe neurodevelopment delay carrying a balanced translocation t(15; 16) (p 11. 2;q 12. 1) dn that we assume caused a position effect {{as a result of the}} accidental juxtaposition of heterochromatin in the euchromatic region. Results FISH mapped the translocation breakpoints (bkps) to 15 p 11. 2 within satellite III and the 16 q 12. 1 euchromatic band within the ITFG 1 gene. The expression of the genes located on both sides of the <b>translocation</b> were <b>tested</b> by means of real-time PCR and three, all located on der(16), were found to be variously perturbed: the euchromatic gene NETO 2 /BTCL 2 was silenced, whereas VPS 35 and SHCBP 1, located within the major heterochromatic block of chromosome 16 q 11. 2, were over-expressed. Pyrosequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation of NETO 2 /BTCL 2 and VPS 35 confirmed the expression findings. Interphase FISH analysis showed that der(16) localised to regions occupied by the beta satellite heterochromatic blocks more frequently than der(15). Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a heterochromatic position effect in humans caused by the juxtaposition of euchromatin/heterochromatin as a result of chromosomal rearrangement. The overall results are fully in keeping with the observations in Drosophila and suggest the occurrence of a human heterochromatin position effect associated with the nuclear repositioning of the der(16) and its causative role in the patient's syndromic phenotype. </p...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to select appropriate targeted therapies for subgroups of patients with lung adenocarcinoma who have specific gene alterations. This prospective study was a multicenter project conducted in Taiwan for assessment of lung adenocarcinoma genetic tests. Five oncogenic drivers, including EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, HER 2 and EML 4 -ALK fusion mutations, were tested. EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and HER 2 mutations were assessed by MALDI-TOF MS (Cohort 1). EML 4 -ALK <b>translocation</b> was <b>tested</b> by Ventana method in EGFR-wild type patients (Cohort 2). From August 2011 to November 2013, a total of 1772 patients with lung adenocarcinoma were enrolled. In Cohort 1 analysis, EGFR, KRAS, HER 2 and BRAF mutations were identified in 987 (55. 7 %), 93 (5. 2 %), 36 (2. 0 %) and 12 (0. 7 %) patients, respectively. Most of these mutations were mutually exclusive, except for co-mutations in seven patients (3 with EGFR + KRAS, 3 with EGFR + HER 2 and 1 with KRAS + BRAF). In Cohort 2 analysis, 29 of 295 EGFR-wild type patients (9. 8 %) were positive for EML 4 -ALK translocation. EGFR mutations were more common in female patients and non-smokers and KRAS mutations were more common in male patients and smokers. Gender and smoking status were not correlated significantly with HER 2, BRAF and EML 4 -ALK mutations. EML 4 -ALK translocation was more common in patients with younger age. This was the first study in Taiwan to explore the incidence of five oncogenic drivers in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and the results could be valuable for physicians in consideration of targeted therapy and inclusion of clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|The signal {{recognition}} particle (SRP) -dependent targeting pathway facilitates rapid, efficient {{delivery of the}} ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC) to the protein <b>translocation</b> channel. We <b>test</b> whether the SRP receptor (SR) locates a vacant protein translocation channel by interacting with the yeast Sec 61 and Ssh 1 translocons. Surprisingly, the slow growth and cotranslational translocation defects caused by deletion of the transmembrane (TM) span of yeast SRbeta (SRbeta-DeltaTM) are exaggerated when the SSH 1 gene is disrupted. Disruption of the SBH 2 gene, which encodes the beta subunit of the Ssh 1 p complex, likewise causes a growth defect when combined with SRbeta-DeltaTM. Cotranslational translocation defects in the ssh 1 DeltaSRbeta-DeltaTM mutant are explained by slow and inefficient in vivo gating of translocons by RNCs. A critical function for translocation channel beta subunits in the SR-channel interaction {{is supported by the}} observation that simultaneous deletion of Sbh 1 p and Sbh 2 p causes a defect in the cotranslational targeting pathway that is similar to the translocation defect caused by deletion of either subunit of the SR...|$|R
40|$|Substantial symplastic {{continuity}} {{appears to}} exist between companion cells (CCs) and sieve {{elements of the}} phloem, which suggests that small solutes within the CC are subject to indiscriminate long-distance transport via the <b>translocation</b> stream. To <b>test</b> this hypothesis, the distributions of exotic and endogenous solutes synthesized in the CCs of minor veins were studied. Octopine, a charged molecule derived from arginine and pyruvate, was efficiently transported through the phloem but was also transferred in substantial amounts to the apoplast, and presumably other non-phloem compartments. The disaccharide galactinol also accumulated in non-phloem compartments, but long-distance transport was limited. Conversely, sucrose, raffinose, and especially stachyose demonstrated reduced accumulation and efficient transport out of the leaf. We conclude that small metabolites in the cytosol of CCs do enter the translocation stream indiscriminately but are also subject to distributive forces, such as nonselective and carrier-mediated membrane transport and symplastic dispersal, that may effectively clear a compound from the phloem or retain it for long-distance transport. A model is proposed in which the transport of oligosaccharides is an adaptive strategy to improve photoassimilate retention, and consequently translocation efficiency, in the phloem...|$|R
40|$|Experiments on sex {{determination}} of the onion fly, Hylemya antiqua (Meigen), are reported {{in the first two}} chapters. The main purpose was to establish if the sex ratio distortion observed in certain crosses, was based on a mechanism which could be used for genetic purposes. Two types of males, XY 1 and XXY 2 , were found and the aberrant sex ratios appeared only to occur in progenies of XXY 2 (and some XXY 2 Y 2 ) males. A numerical variation for Y 2 was frequently observed in embryos, larval ganglion cells and especially in testes, which is caused by numerical non-disjunction in somatic cells. The sex ratio distortion is attributed to such a numerical variation of Y 2 between primordial germ cells. Some progenies with a highly distorted sex ratio in male direction descended probably from XXY 2 Y 2 males. Since an effective selection of XXY 2 Y 2 males is not possible, this type of sex ratio distortion is not suited for application in a genetic control method. Other subjects treated in chapters 1 and 2 are gynandromorphism, a polymorphism with respect to the length of the X-chromosome and X-polysomy. In the progeny of one cross a chromosome morphologically identical to Y 2 but lacking its holandric inheritance was found. From its inheritance in various crosses it could be concluded that it {{was nothing more than a}} (mutated) non-functional Y 2 chromosome. The meiotic segregation of a Y 1 -linked translocation T 61 is reported in the third chapter. The high percentage of alternate segregation observed in T 61 -heterozygous males (22 YXY 2 ) was in good accordance with the high fertility of this translocation (95 %). Because of an early separation (or asynapsis) of the centromeric regions of the acrocentric X and Y 2 , chain quadrivalents with X and Y 2 in terminal position predominated in diakinesis/ prometaphase I stages. In these chain quadrivalents adjacent l is supposed to be unstable since neither X nor Y 2 have a neighbouring centromere in trans-position. The very low frequency of adjacent 2 is attributed to a preferential coorientation of homologous centromeres. The suitability of T 61 for genetic sexing (preferential killing of females) is discussed. Double-translocation heterozygous T 14 /T 61 males (2 6 2 Y 6 2 6 XY 2 ) were produced by intercrossing T 14 -homozygous females (2 6 2 6 6 2 6 2 XX) and T 61 -heterozygous males (22 Y 66 XY 2 ) These double heterozygotes showed several segregation types but for predominated. The total frequency of duplication/deficiency gametes was 60 - 65 %. Application possibilities for these heterozygotes in genetic control of the onion fly are discussed. The meiotic segregation of five different autosomal reciprocal translocations are given in chapter 5. For translocation T 14, which has very short interstitial segments, significant differences in segregation between the sexes were found. In males the ratio of alt. : adj. 1 :adj. 2 was about 7 : 3 : 0 and in females 8 : 1 : 3. It is assumed that the very intimate meiotic pairing in males (without chiasmata) results in relatively very short "Coorientation Determining Distances" (CDD's) between the homologous centromeres. Due to these short CDD's a preferential coorientation between homologous centromeres is expected favouring alternate and adjacent l segregation. On the contrary, in females chiasmata act very probably as reference points for coorientation. Due to variable positions of the centromeres, in T 14 -heterozygous females less pronounced differences in CDD's between homologous and non-homologous are expected as in males. This is suggested to be the reason that in females a coorientation between non-homologous centromeres can occur resulting in a certain frequency of adjacent 2. The very low frequencies or absence of adjacent 2 in the other four translocations is attributed to their longer interstitial segments. For translocation T 14 a pure breeding stock of homozygotes could be obtained using egg-hatch percentages and cytology for the recognition of the karyotypes (chapter 6). In cage experiments under laboratory conditions the competitiveness of the <b>translocation</b> homozygotes was <b>tested.</b> Starting from an initial population consisting of equal numbers of translocation homozygotes (TT) and wild type flies (++), the karyotype frequencies were determined for three successive, non-overlapping generations. The results obtained did not suggest substantial differences in fitness between TT and ++. In field cage experiments (chapter 7) a high diapause sensitivity was found for the translocation homozygotes as well as for the laboratory strain of wild type flies (++) used. As a consequence of this high diapause sensitivity the fitness of the homozygotes could not be determined under field conditions. In the "General Discussion" different application possibilities of translocations for genetic control of the onion fly are discussed. A summary of unpublished data concerning the egg-hatch and pupal survival of eight threechromosome double-translocation heterozygotes and three more complex translocation heterozygotes is also presented there. The aim of these experiments was to determine if perhaps a double translocation could be isolated meeting the conditions for a stable equilibrium. However, neither of these translocations met these conditions. Firstly, the frequencies of duplication/deficiency gametes were not high enough; secondly, insufficient complementation occurred and, thirdly, the recombination percentages in the differential segments were too high (resulting in undesirable karyotypes). Two of three double <b>translocations</b> <b>tested,</b> appeared to be viable as homozygotes in the adult stage...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC 3000 is a {{pathogen}} {{of tomato}} and Arabidopsis. The hrp-hrcencoded type III secretion system (TTSS), which injects bacterial effector proteins (primarily called Hop or Avr proteins) into plant cells, {{is required for}} pathogenicity. In addition to being regulated by the HrpL alternative sigma factor, most avr or hop genes encode proteins with N termini that have several characteristic features, including (i) {{a high percentage of}} Ser residues, (ii) an aliphatic amino acid (Ile, Leu, or Val) or Pro at the third or fourth position, and (iii) a lack of negatively charged amino acids within the first 12 residues. Here, the well-studied effector AvrPto was used to optimize a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase (Cya) reporter system for Hrp-mediated translocation of P. syringae TTSS effectors into plant cells. This system includes a cloned P. syringae hrp gene cluster and the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana. Analyses of truncated AvrPto proteins fused to Cya revealed that the N-terminal 16 amino acids and/or codons of AvrPto are sufficient to direct weak translocation into plant cells and that longer N-terminal fragments direct progressively stronger <b>translocation.</b> AvrB, <b>tested</b> because it is poorly secreted in cultures by the P. syringae Hrp system, was translocated into plant cells as effectively as AvrPto. The translocation of several DC 3000 candidate Hop proteins was also examined by using Cya as a reporter, which led to identification of three new intact Hop proteins, designated HopPtoQ, HopPtoT 1, and HopPtoV, as well as two truncated Hop proteins encoded by the naturally disrupted genes hopPtoS 4 ::tnpA and hopPtoAG::tnpA. We also confirmed that HopPtoK, HopPtoC, and AvrPphEPto are translocated into plant cells. These results increased the number of Hrp system-secreted proteins in DC 3000 to 40. Although most of the newly identified Hop proteins possess N termini that have the same features as the N termini of previously described Hop proteins, HopPtoV has none of these characteristics. Our results indicate that Cya should be a useful reporter for exploring multiple aspects of the Hrp system in P. syringae...|$|R

The hypothesis that translocation of membrane-active peptides across a lipid bilayer is determined by the Gibbs energy of insertion of the peptide into the bilayer is re-examined in the light of new experimental tests. The original hypothesis and its motivation are first revisited, examining some of the specific predictions that it generated, followed by the results of the initial <b>tests.</b> <b>Translocation</b> is understood as requiring two previous steps: binding and insertion in the membrane. The problem of peptide binding to membranes, its prediction, measurement, and calculation are addressed. Particular attention is given to understanding the reason for the need for amphipathic structures in the function of membrane-active peptides. Insertion into the membrane is then examined. Hydrophobicity scales are compared, and their influence on calculations is discussed. The relation between translocation and graded or all-or-none peptide-induced flux from or into lipid vesicles is also considered. Finally, the most recent work on translocation is examined, both experimental and from molecular dynamics simulations.

40|$|The {{basis for}} the high {{incidence}} of infectious complications in. portal hypertension (PHT) remains unclear. The hypothesis that PHT induces bacterial <b>translocation</b> (BT) was <b>tested</b> in a rat model with or without mono-association with streptomycin resistant Escherichia coli C 25 and with or without hypovolemic shock. PHT was achieved by partial portal vein ligation and three weeks later hypovolemic shock (HS) was induced. Blood, liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes cultures were performed twenty-four hours later. PHT promoted BT to mesenteric lymph nodes in indigenous flora (4 / 6 [67 %]) and monoassociated animals (7 / 9 [78 %]) compared to sham laparotomy and sham shock (SL + SS) animals (0 / 6 [0 %] and 2 / 9 [22 %] respectively) (p 0. 03). The combination of PHT and HS resulted in increased mortality in mono-associated (7 / 15 [47 %]) and non mono-associated animals (8 / 15 [53 %]). No significant translocation was noted in liver and spleen and bacteremia was found only in the PHT + HS mono-associated animals (4 / 8 [50 %]). PHT induces BT to mesenteric lymph nodes and this may account for {{the high incidence of}} septic complications associated witti PHT. In this model, the addition of HS to PHT leads to an increased mortality but without uniform translocation of the gut flora beyond mesenteric lymph nodes.

40|$|PLC-[zeta] is a sperm factor {{responsible}} for inducing calcium oscillations inside an oocyte leading to outcomes ranging from oocyte activation, block of polyspermy and down-regulation of genes involved in oocyte development. The {{ultimate goal of}} these experiments {{was to develop a}} bacterium, S. typhimurium that could mimic the effects of sperm on a mature oocyte. While the development of PLC- [zeta] was underway, another goal was attempted. No one had ever tested the interactions between S. typhimurium and an oocyte, and it was uncertain if the bacterium could adequately deliver proteins into the ooplasm. Although S. typhimurium's secretion and <b>translocation</b> apparatus was <b>tested</b> with HeLa cells using a 1 HeLa to 100 bacteria ratio, and adenylate cyclase (reporter) was detected through relative cAMP levels, several factors posed a problem with the infection of the oocyte. For example, Salmonella's needle was 500 times shorter than the length of the zona pellucida (ZP) of the egg. The zona pellucida, a protein matrix, serves as an additional barrier between the sperm and the egg plasma membrane. Typically, S. typhimurium can bind directly to a host cell and translocate its effector proteins directly into the cytoplasm. In this case, S. typhimurium was only able to penetrate the ZP and secrete into the ooplasm once its numbers reached 1, 000, 000 cfu per oocyte. With such a high number required to effectively deliver proteins into an oocyte, it was clear that this delivery system was not the ideal alternative to conventional contraceptive...|$|R
40|$|The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, {{resulting}} from the t(9; 22) translocation, is characteristic of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). As {{a result of this}} translocation, two novel chimeric genes are generated and the bcr/abl and abl/bcr fusion proteins expressed. The bcr/abl fusion mRNA is present in all CML patients, whereas the reciprocal abl/bcr fusion mRNA is detectable in about 80 % of the Ph+ CML patients. These fusion proteins may undergo enzymatic degradation in the cytosol and give rise to MHC class I restricted peptide epitopes originating from the junctional regions of the translocation products, which thus may serve as novel tumor specific antigens. Previously, other groups have tested peptides corresponding to the junctional region of the bcr/abl protein for their binding capacity to HLA class I molecules and have identified a few candidate epitopes. Peptides originating from the abl/bcr fusion protein have on the other hand so far been neglected, for no apparent reason. We have now extended these studies to include also the reciprocal abl/bcr <b>translocation</b> product by <b>testing</b> a large panel of synthetic peptides corresponding to the junctional regions of both the abl/bcr and the bcr/abl fusion proteins for their ability to stabilize HLA class I molecules. We find that the abl/bcr translocation product may be an even more important source of CML specific peptide antigens and together the junctional sequences of both these proteins contain peptide sequences which bind efficiently to a number of HLA molecules (HLA-A 1, -A 2, -A 3, -A 11, -B 7, -B 27, -B 35) and thus may serve as candidate CML specific tumor antigens...|$|R
40|$|Translocation, catalyzed by {{elongation}} factor EF-G, is the precise {{movement of the}} tRNA-mRNA complex within the ribosome following peptide bond formation. Here we examine the structural requirement for A- and P-site tRNAs in EF-G-catalyzed translocation by substituting anticodon stem-loop (ASL) analogs for the respective tRNAs. Translocation of mRNA and tRNA was monitored independently; mRNA movement was assayed by toeprinting, while tRNA and ASL movement was monitored by hydroxyl radical probing by Fe(II) tethered to the ASLs and by chemical footprinting. Translocation depends on occupancy of both A and P sites by tRNA bound in a mRNA-dependent fashion. The requirement for an A-site tRNA can be satisfied by a 15 nucleotide ASL analog comprising only a 4 base pair (bp) stem and a 7 nucleotide anticodon loop. Translocation of the ASL is both EF-G- and GTP-dependent, and is inhibited by the translocational inhibitor thiostrepton. These findings show that the D, T and acceptor stem regions of A-site tRNA are not essential for EF-G-dependent translocation. In contrast, no translocation occurs if the P-site tRNA is substituted with an ASL, indicating that other elements of P-site tRNA structure are required for <b>translocation.</b> We also <b>tested</b> the effect of increasing the A-site ASL stem length from 4 to 33 bp on translocation from A to P site. Translocation efficiency decreases as the ASL stem extends beyond 22 bp, corresponding approximately to the maximum dimension of tRNA along the anticodon-D arm axis. This result suggests that a structural feature of the ribosome between the A and P sites, interferes with movement of tRNA analogs that exceed the normal dimensions of the coaxial tRNA anticodon-D arm...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Balanced {{chromosomal}} rearrangements represent one of {{the most}} frequent indications for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Although fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been successfully employed for diagnosis in such cases, this approach usually restricts assessment of the chromosomes involved in the rearrangement. Furthermore, with FISH-based strategies, it is sometimes necessary to create patient-specific protocols, increasing the waiting time and costs. In the current study, we explored the use of two comprehensive chromosome screening methods, conventional metaphase comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and microarray-CGH (aCGH), as alternatives for PGD of chromosome rearrangements. METHODS: The study included 16 patients who underwent 20 cycles of PGD for a variety of chromosome rearrangements (reciprocal or Robertsonian <b>translocations</b> or inversions). <b>Testing</b> was performed at various embryonic stages using CGH (9 cases) or aCGH (11 cases). RESULTS: Results were obtained for 121 out of 132 samples (91. 7 %). Of the diagnosed samples, 48. 8 % were found to carry abnormalities associated with the rearrangement, either alone or in combination with other chromosomal abnormalities. A further 28. 9 % of samples were normal/balanced for the rearranged chromosomes, but affected by aneuploidy for other chromosomes. Only 22. 3 % of samples were chromosomally normal. Of the 15 patients who completed their treatment cycles, 5 became pregnant after one or two cycles resulting in four healthy births. The delivery rate per cycle was 21 % (27 % per embryo transfer). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to describe the clinical application of comprehensive chromosome screening applied to polar bodies, blastomeres or trophectoderm cells from patients carrying inversions and translocations. Using these techniques, most patients requesting PGD for a chromosome rearrangement can be treated using a single protocol. Additionally, the detection of abnormalities affecting chromosomes unrelated to the rearrangement may assist in the selection of viable embryos for transfer...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{promyelocytic leukemia}} (APL) is {{malignant}} hematologic disease characterized by translocation t(15; 17). This translocation {{results in the}} formation of PML/RARα oncogene and accumulation of malignant promyelocytes that do not differentiate into mature granulocytes. Treatment of this type of leukemia is based on differentiation agents all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic-trioxide, which induce degradation and conformational changes of the oncogene PML/RARα. However, prolonged treatment with ATRA often results in relapse, due to development of ATRA resistance by leukemic cells, and serious side-effects. In this research we aimed to investigate possible mechanisms of BMP-mediated suppression of ATRA-induced differentiation using myeloid leukemia cell lines NB 4 and HL 60. We used two myeloid leukemia cell lines: NB 4, which carries the specific t(15; 17) translocation, and HL 60, a myeloblastic leukemia cell line that lacks t(15; 17) <b>translocation,</b> to <b>test</b> if the BMP effect is PML/RARα specific. Cell lines were treated with ATRA and BMPs, and, in some experiments, BMP-antagonists NOGGIN. ATRA induced differentiation of malignant promyelocytes into neutrophils in both tested cell lines. Addition of BMPs in ATRA-treated samples significantly reduced the percentage of differentiated cells. This anti-differentiation effect of BMPs was reversed by BMP-antagonist NOGGIN. To investigate the mechanism of anti-differentiation effect of BMPs on ATRA-treated myeloid leukemia cell lines NB 4 and HL 60, we analyzed the expression pattern of several genes involved in proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, which are, at the same time, involved in both BMP- and ATRA-signaling pathway. Those in vitro results were confirmed in bone marrow and peripheral blood samples of APL patients. Gene expression analysis revealed induction of ID expression in both NB 4 cell line and bone marrow APL samples. Addition of BMPs further enhanced ID gene expression in NB 4 cells. Moreover, ATRA induced expression of differentiation genes PU. 1 and C/EBPε. This effect was suppressed by combined treatment with ATRA and BMP. Also, we confirmed significant positive correlation between expression of total receptor RARα, important for differentiation effect of retinoic acid, and transcription factor PU. 1 in bone marrow samples of APL patients. In the same samples, cKit expression negatively correlated with PML/RARα oncogene, but positively with total RARα, indicationg the role of cKit in differentiation of APL cells. Finally, the expression of total RARα was in negative correlation with BMP- 6 and in positive correlation with BMP-antagonist BAMBI. Based on the obtained results, we concluded that ID genes and proteins could mediate antidifferentation effect of BMPs. Also, our findings suggest that PU. 1 and C/EBPε could be responsible for the interference of BMP-signal and ATRA-differentiation effect. Results of our investigation confirmed the important role of BMPs in the pathogenesis of APL, and indicate that BMP molecules may be involved in the development of ATRA-resistance in APL patients...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Soil {{contamination}} by copper (Cu) {{and lead}} (Pb) {{is a widespread}} environmental problem. For phytoextraction to be successful and viable in environmental remediation, strategies that can improve plant uptake must be identified. In the present study we investigated the use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer as {{an efficient way to}} enhance accumulation of Cu and Pb from contaminated industrial soils into amaranth, Indian mustard and sunflower. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Plants were grown in a greenhouse and fertilized with N fertilizer at rates of 0, 190 and 380 mg kg⁻¹ soil. Shoots, roots and total accumulation of Cu and Pb, transfer factor (TF), translocation index were assessed to evaluate the transport and <b>translocation</b> ability of <b>tested</b> plants. Addition of N fertilizer acidified the industrial soil and caused the pH to decrease to 5. 5 from an initial pH of 6. 9. Industrial soil amended with N fertilizer resulted in the highest accumulation of Pb and Cu (for Pb 10. 1 - 15. 5 mg kg⁻¹, for Cu 11. 6 - 16. 8 mg kg⁻¹) in the shoots, which was two to four folds higher relative to the concentration in roots in all the three plants used. Sunflower removed significantly higher Pb (50 - 54 %) and Cu (34 - 38 %) followed by amaranth and Indian mustard from industrial soils with the application of N fertilizer. The TF was < 1 while the shoot and root concentration (SC/RC) ratios of Pb and Cu were between 1. 3 - 4. 3 and 1. 8 - 3. 8, respectively, regardless of plant species. CONCLUSIONS: Sunflower is the best plant species to carry out phytoextraction of Pb and Cu. In contrast, Pb and Cu removal by Indian mustard and amaranth shows great potential as quick and short duration vegetable crops. The results suggest that the application of N fertilizer in contaminated industrial soil is an effective amendment for the phytoextraction of Pb and Cu from contaminated industrial soils...|$|R
