5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe <b>that</b> <b>correct,</b> slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Japanese {{publications}} {{have emerged}} {{in an attempt to}} standardize taiko performance. The Nippon Taiko Foundation was formed in 1979; its primary goals were to foster good relations among taiko groups in Japan and to both publicize and teach how to perform taiko. Daihachi Oguchi, the leader of the Foundation, wrote Japan Taiko with other teachers in 1994 out of concern <b>that</b> <b>correct</b> form in performance would degrade over time. The instructional publication described the different drums used in kumi-daiko performance, methods of gripping, correct form, and suggestions on instrumentation. The book also contains practice exercises and transcribed pieces from Oguchi's group, Osuwa Daiko. While there were similar textbooks published before 1994, this publication had much more visibility due to the Foundation's scope.|$|E

25|$|The genetic {{instructions}} {{of every}} replicating cell {{in a living}} organism are contained within its DNA.

Honey bee, not honeybee, is the listed common name in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System, the Entomological Society of America Common Names of Insects Database, and the Tree of Life Web Project. Nonetheless, compounds gradually solidify in the orthography of natural languages in ways that do not always comply with prescription.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, Machen {{joined the}} Princeton Seminary as an {{instructor}} in the New Testament, after receiving an assurance {{that he would}} not have to sign a statement of faith. Among his Princeton influences were Francis Landey Patton, who had been the prosecutor in a nineteenth-century heresy trial, and B. B. Warfield, whom he described as the greatest man he had ever met. Warfield maintained <b>that</b> <b>correct</b> doctrine was the primary means by which Christians influenced the surrounding culture. He emphasised a high view of scripture and the defence of supernaturalism. It appears that under their influence Machen resolved his crisis of faith. In 1914, he was ordained and the next year he became an Assistant Professor of New Testament studies.|$|E

25|$|McDaniel et al. (2004) further {{distinguished}} event-based prospective memory into immediate-execute {{tasks and}} delayed-execute tasks. Immediate-execute tasks involve a response {{as soon as}} a particular cue is noticed, while delayed-execute tasks involve delays between the perception of the relevant cue and the performance of the intended action. Delayed-execute tasks more commonly occur in real life when circumstances of a situation prevent intermediate action once the cue has been perceived. Research was performed by McDaniel et al. (2004), in which participants completed tasks involving various delays and interruptions between cues and responses. It was demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>correct</b> performance suffered when there was a delay or interruption during a task. However, it was further shown that the use of reminders for participants eliminated the effects of the interruption task.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{many other}} major civilizations where written law {{was held in}} honor and often {{attributed}} to divine origin, law in early China was viewed in purely secular terms, and its initial appearance was greeted with hostility by Confucian thinkers as indicative of a serious moral decline, a violation of human morality, and even a disturbance of the total cosmic order. Historically, the people's awareness and acceptance of ethical norms was shaped far more by the pervasive influence of custom and usage of property and by inculcating moral precepts than by any formally enacted system of law. Early emperors however embraced the Legalist ideal {{as a way of}} exerting control over their large and growing territory and population. This process was integrated with traditional Chinese beliefs in the cosmic order, holding <b>that</b> <b>correct</b> behavior was behavior consonant with the appropriate responses set by fǎ. Xíng states the potential costs to the individual of exceeding them and imposes penalties for these actions.|$|E

The sacrificer was {{not to think of}} the sacrifice as food for God, for God neither hungers nor eats. Rather, the worshiper was to offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving and call upon God in times of trouble, and thus God would deliver the worshiper and the worshiper would honor God.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2005, in {{the light}} of Penrose's findings, Equitable started a £2 billion High Court action against {{auditors}} [...] Ernst & Young, reduced 3 months later to £0.7 billion, claiming they had failed to inform the directors of the seriousness of its position. However lawyers advised they could not prove <b>that</b> <b>correct</b> advice would have changed the outcome, and the case was dropped in September. Ernst & Young described the case as [...] "ill conceived". Simultaneously, Equitable started a £3.3 billion claim against former directors, claiming that they failed in their duties to policyholders.

2500|$|What the {{principle}} of relativity points out is <b>that</b> <b>correct</b> mathematical calculations can be made regardless of the reference frame chosen, and these will all agree with each other as to the predictions of actual motions of bodies with respect to each other.

[...] A geocentric coordinate system can be more convenient when dealing only with bodies mostly influenced by the gravity of the Earth (such as artificial satellites and the Moon), or when calculating what the sky will look like when viewed from Earth (as opposed to an imaginary observer looking down on the entire solar system, where a different coordinate system might be more convenient).|$|E
2500|$|Michael Servetus, {{using the}} name [...] "Michel de Villeneuve" [...] during his stay in France, was Vesalius' fellow student and the best Galenist at the University of Paris, {{according}} to Johann Winter von Andernach, who taught both. In the Galenism of the Renaissance, editions of the Opera Omnia by Galen were very important. It was begun in Venice in 1541–1542 by the Guinta. There were fourteen editions of the book from that date until 1625. Just one edition was produced from Lyon between 1548 and 1551. The Lyon edition has commentaries on breathing and blood streaming <b>that</b> <b>correct</b> the work of earlier renowned authors such as Vesalius, Caius or Janus Cornarius.
