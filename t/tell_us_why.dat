500|$|The final {{blame for}} the {{military}} stalemate was determined to lie not in military preparation, supplies, leadership, or superior tactics by the Seminoles, but in Florida's impenetrable terrain. An army surgeon wrote: [...] "It {{is in fact a}} most hideous region to live in, a perfect paradise for Indians, alligators, serpents, frogs, and every other kind of loathsome reptile." [...] The land seemed to inspire extreme reactions of wonder or hatred. In 1870, an author described the mangrove forests as a [...] "waste of nature's grandest exhibition to have these carnivals of splendid vegetation occurring in isolated places where it is but seldom they are seen." [...] A band of hunters, naturalists, and collectors ventured through in 1885, taking along with them the 17-year-old grandson of an early resident of Miami. The landscape unnerved the young man shortly after he entered the Shark River: [...] "The place looked wild and lonely. About three o'clock it seemed to get on Henry's nerves and we saw him crying, he would not <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>why,</b> he was just plain scared." ...|$|E
2500|$|SEPTA {{was voted}} the best large transit agency in North America by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) in July 2012. The award was criticized by Next City {{columnist}} Diana Lind, stating that despite some outward appearances of improvement, SEPTA still largely operates {{under a cloud}} of non-transparency and continues to lack a system-wide expansion program for the [...] future. This is most notable in the regional rail division, which suffered severe cutbacks in the 1980s and whose affected routes have been converted into rail trails, preventing a restoration of those services for the foreseeable future. When asked to produce data pertaining to SEPTA's repeated attempts to consolidate bus stops, Lind observed [...] "the report on the project barely elaborates on the information. SEPTA’s trials deserve public attention and input. The public deserves the data — show us the average times {{before and after the}} pilot. Give reader surveys. <b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>why</b> you haven’t tried another pilot on another bus line." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chad {{faced the}} same problem over {{ordination}} as Wilfrid, and so set off to seek ordination amid the chaos caused by the plague. Bede tells us that he travelled first to Canterbury, where he found that Archbishop Deusdedit was dead and his replacement was still awaited. Bede does not <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>why</b> Chad diverted to Canterbury. The journey seems pointless, since the archbishop had died three years previously– a fact {{that must have been}} well known in Northumbria, and was the very reason Wilfrid had to go abroad. The most obvious reason for Chad's tortuous travels would be that he was also on a diplomatic mission from Oswiu, seeking to build an encircling alliance around Mercia, which was rapidly recovering from its position of weakness. From Canterbury he travelled to Wessex, where he was ordained by bishop Wini of the West Saxons and two British, i.e. Welsh, bishops. None of these bishops was recognised by Rome. Bede points out that [...] "at that time there was no other bishop in all Britain canonically ordained except Wini" [...] and the latter had been installed irregularly by the king of the West Saxons.|$|E

2500|$|After the 7 July 2005 London bombings, Friedman {{called for}} the U.S. State Department to [...] "shine a {{spotlight}} on hate speech wherever it appears", {{and to create a}} quarterly [...] "War of Ideas Report, which would focus on those religious leaders and writers who are inciting violence against others". Friedman said the governmental speech-monitoring should go beyond those who actually advocate violence, and [...] include also those whom former State Department spokesperson Jamie Rubin calls [...] "excuse makers". In his July 22 column, Friedman wrote against the [...] "excuses" [...] made by terrorists or apologists who blame their actions on third-party influences or pressures. [...] "After every major terrorist incident, the excuse makers come out to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> ... <b>why</b> the terrorists acted. These excuse makers are just one notch less despicable than the terrorists and also deserve to be exposed. When you live in an open society like London, where anyone with a grievance can publish an article, run for office or start a political movement, the notion that blowing up a busload of innocent civilians in response to Iraq is somehow [...] "understandable" [...] is outrageous. [...] "It erases the distinction between legitimate dissent and terrorism" [...] Mr. Rubin said, [...] "and an open society needs to maintain a clear wall between them." [...] As part of their response to this column, the editors at FAIR encouraged their readers to contact Friedman and inform him that [...] "opponents of the Iraq War do not deserve to be on a government blacklist-even if they oppose the war because they believe it encourages terrorism".|$|E
