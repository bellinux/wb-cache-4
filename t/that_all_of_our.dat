500|$|The tide of {{the battle}} started to turn when Manfred Sideous, the initial N3/PL fleet commander, handed control to Vince Draken, CEO of Northern Coalition. Vince Draken managed to {{concentrate}} fire on and destroy several CFC/Rus Titans, and forced some additional Russian Titans to leave the system with depleted shields and armor. [...] However, N3/PL overestimated their success and began to focus their attacks on the Titan belonging to Sort Dragon, the commander of all remaining Russian forces in the field. This Titan had very high damage resistance, and Sort Dragon drew upon his entire fleet to assist in repairing it, enabling it to hold out much longer than most other Titans up to that point. By the time his Titan fell, the CFC/Rus had managed to destroy five N3/PL Titans, putting the alliance well ahead. James Carl, {{a member of the}} N3/Pandemic Legion coalition, reported to the Associated Press that [...] "It looks like CFC is winning, but we're hoping now <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> US players are online, we'll turn the tide." [...] But when the US-timezone players logged on and reinforcements became available, PL did not see the numbers they had expected, and the CFC blockaded adjacent systems to prevent them joining the battle. Eventually, N3/PL could no longer destroy any Titans, and ordered a retreat. They switched their fire onto CFC/Rus's Dreadnoughts in an attempt to take out as many ships as possible during retreat. Due to their spy network, CFC knew that N3/PL had ordered a retreat and deployed Interdictors and Heavy Interdictors to prevent the withdrawal. N3/PL lost several more Titans, Super Carriers, and Capitals in the extraction, with many trapped by the warp disruption bubbles strewn throughout the battle area.|$|E

2500|$|Kant thinks <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> actions, whether {{motivated}} by inclination or morality, must follow some law. For example, {{if a person}} wants to qualify for nationals in ultimate frisbee, {{he will have to}} follow a law that tells him to practice his backhand pass, among other things. Notice, however, that this law is only binding on the person who wants to qualify for nationals in ultimate frisbee. In this way, it is contingent upon the ends that he sets and the circumstances that he is in. We know from the third proposition, however, that the moral law must bind universally and necessarily, that is, regardless of ends and circumstances. [...] At this point, Kant asks, ‘what kind of law can that be, the representation of which must determine the will, even without regard for the effect expected from it...?’ (4:402) He concludes that the only remaining alternative is a law that reflects only the form of law itself, namely that of universality. [...] Thus, Kant arrives at his well-known categorical imperative, the moral law referenced in the above discussion of duty. Kant defines the categorical imperative as the following: “I ought never to act except {{in such a way that}} I could also will that my maxim should become a universal law.” (4:402) ...|$|E

40|$|During the {{formative}} period {{of most of}} the current doctrines of negligence law, liability in tort was looked on as shifting a loss that had already occurred from one individual to another [...] generally from the person who suffered the loss to the person who caused it.
