5|$|A {{number of}} tests {{that can be used}} to test the {{function}} of the thyroid, for the presence of diseases, and for the success or failure of treatment. Blood tests in general aim to measure thyroid function or determine the cause of thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid function tests include a battery of blood tests including <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, as well as <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> of TSH. They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).|$|E

30|$|The {{sequential}} implementation for multisensor multitarget tracking in clutter {{is introduced}} in [19, 20], which processes <b>the</b> <b>measurements</b> from one sensor at a time, and <b>the</b> <b>measurements</b> of <b>the</b> next sensor are {{then used to}} further improve the intermediate state estimation. However, <b>the</b> <b>measurements</b> of different illuminators in the multistatic passive radar system in a single frequency (DAB/DVB) network are indistinguishable, the typical sequential approach needs to be modified slightly.

Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize {{plant health status}} from a satellite platform. This approach exploits {{the fact that in}} those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker. <b>The</b> <b>measurement</b> is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.|$|E

5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms of}} ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> of the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on {{the clinical}} presentation of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E
