5|$|Sallekhana {{differs from}} {{other forms of}} ritual deaths {{recognized}} in Jainism as appropriate. The other situations consider ritual death <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> for a mendicant than breaking his or her Five Great vows (Mahavrata). For example, celibacy {{is one of the}} Five vows, and ritual death is considered better than being raped or seduced or if the mendicant community would be defamed. A ritual death under these circumstances by consuming poison is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> and allows for an auspicious rebirth.|$|E

Kanō applied himself thoroughly to learning Kitō-ryū, believing Iikubo's throwing techniques in particular <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> {{than in the}} schools he had previously studied.

5|$|Arriving in Iaşi (Jassy) in 1876, Goldfaden was {{fortunate}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> {{known as a}} good poet — many of whose poems had been set to music and had become popular songs — than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was {{just a way to}} starve; she suggested {{that there would be a}} lot more of a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs in the garden of Shimen Mark, Grădina Pomul Verde ("the Green Fruit-Tree Garden").|$|E
5|$|For a long time, {{bivalves}} {{were thought}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> adapted to aquatic life than brachiopods were, outcompeting and relegating them to minor niches in later ages. These two taxa appeared in textbooks {{as an example}} of replacement by competition. Evidence given for this included the fact that bivalves needed less food to subsist because of their energetically efficient ligament-muscle system for opening and closing valves. All this has been broadly disproven, though; rather, the prominence of modern bivalves over brachiopods seems due to chance disparities in their response to extinction events.|$|E
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E

5|$|On 7 June 2015 the World Championships {{were moved}} to their new home, one of the cycle track bridges over the river Windrush in Langel Common, near to the Cogges Manor Farm Museum in Witney, Oxfordshire. The new {{location}} still retains a rural atmosphere while being {{only a few minutes}} walk from Witney town centre with its convenient public transport links to Oxford. Car Parking is also much closer than at the original venue, which was a factor that influenced the choice of venue. As this was the first year at the new location, the organizers decided not to hold the 2015 team games.. However, the team games were restored in 2016. The move to the new venue has also allowed the event to move to June when the weather is likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once in the Klondike, {{very few}} women—less than one percent—actually worked as miners. Many {{were married to}} miners; however, their lives as {{partners}} on the gold fields were still hard and often lonely. They had extensive domestic duties, including thawing ice and snow for water, breaking up frozen food, chopping wood and collecting wild foods. In Dawson and other towns, some women took in laundry to make money. This was a physically demanding job, but could be relatively easily combined with child care duties. Others took jobs in the service industry, for example as waitresses or seamstresses, which could pay well, but were often punctuated by periods of unemployment. Both men and women opened roadhouses, but women were considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> at running them. A few women worked in the packing trade, carrying goods on their backs, or became domestic servants.|$|E

5|$|Some historians such as Angela Woollacott and Kumari Jayawardena {{state that}} even though Gandhi often and {{publicly}} expressed {{his belief in the}} equality of sexes, yet his vision was one of gender difference and complementarity between them. Women, to Gandhi, should be educated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> in the domestic realm and educate the next generation. His views on women's right were less liberal and more similar to puritan-Victorian expectations of women, states Jayawardena, than other Hindu leaders with him who supported economic independence and equal gender rights in all aspects.|$|E
5|$|The Collins-class {{submarines}} {{experienced a}} wide range of problems during their construction and early service life. Many of these were attributed to the submarines being a new, untested design, and were successfully addressed as they were discovered. Most systems and features worked with few or no problems, while the boats' maximum speed, manoeuvrability, and low-speed submerged endurance were found to exceed specifications. The ship control system, which during development had been marked as a major potential problem, functioned beyond positive expectation: for example, the autopilot (which aboard Collins was nicknamed 'Sven') was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> at maintaining depth during snorting than most helmsmen.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1941 {{officials}} at the War Office and in the Army had finally decided that light tanks as a concept were a liability, and too vulnerable {{to be used by}} the British Army. This was due to the poor performance of British light tanks during the Battle of France, caused when a shortage of tanks designed to engage enemy tanks had led to light tanks being deployed against German armour; the resulting high casualties led to the War Office rethinking the suitability of the light tank design. The pre-war role of the light tank, that of reconnaissance, had also been found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> carried out by scout cars which had smaller crews and better cross-country abilities. Consequently, by the time that significant numbers of the Mk VIII were being produced by Metro-Cammell, they had already become obsolete and did not see combat. There was a requirement for a limited number of light tanks within the organization of British armoured divisions, but this had already been met by the American-produced M5 Stuart light tank. A policy report issued in December 1942 suggested that the tank could be issued to reconnaissance regiments or special light tank regiments raised for specialized operations. These suggestions were discussed and discarded, and instead it was decided that those tanks built should be handed over to the Royal Air Force for use in defending airfields and airbases.|$|E

The relationship was initiated after Gjems-Onstad had written a letter of sympathy to Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith some years ahead. When in Salisbury, he met with Smith, Foreign Minister P. K. van der Byl and Head of the Military Peter Walls. Eager to participate with the government army during the Rhodesian Bush War, he was authorised by Walls to patrol with Rhodesian Security Forces around a garrison near Lake Kariba for two days. While he earlier had written he did not think democracy and human rights was optimal in the country—he considered Botswana to be one of the better countries—he considered rule of law <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> than in countries the Norwegian government had supported financially, such as Idi Amin's Uganda.|$|E
