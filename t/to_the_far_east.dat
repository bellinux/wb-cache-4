5|$|There {{remained}} {{the prospect of}} American assistance. In secret talks in Washington, D.C., in June 1939, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William D. Leahy {{raised the possibility of}} an American fleet being sent to Singapore. In April 1940, the American naval attaché in London, Captain Alan Kirk, approached the Vice Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Phillips, to ask if, in the event of the United States Fleet being sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> <b>East,</b> the docking facilities at Singapore could be made available, as those at Subic Bay were inadequate. He received full assurances that they would be. Hopes for American assistance were dashed at the staff conference in Washington, D.C., in February 1941. The U.S. Navy was primarily focused on the Atlantic. The American chiefs envisaged relieving British warships in the Atlantic and Mediterranean so a British fleet could be sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> <b>East.</b>|$|E

5|$|A fleet was {{necessary}} for the defeat of Japan, and eventually a sizeable one, the British Pacific Fleet, did go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> <b>East,</b> where it fought alongside the United States Pacific Fleet.
