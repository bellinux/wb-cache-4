5|$|At landfall, Fern had {{weakened}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> {{tropical storm}} {{as it moved}} further inland. Because the center of Fern was elongated, it {{was still able to}} receive moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and as a result, weakening was slow. Between September 10 and September 11, Fern bypassed Corpus Christi, Texas, before dissipating as a tropical depression after crossing the Rio Grande into northern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{originally}} {{being set}} for October 30, the film's release date was rescheduled for October 26, 2009 due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> demand by Jackson's fans.

5|$|Ernest Manning succeeded Aberhart as premier. Under Manning, Social Credit {{moved away}} from the {{monetary}} theory of Douglas and towards traditional conservatism. Manning lead the party through seven-straight massive majorities, (although in 1955 his government received barely more seats than Aberhart had received in 1940, due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> but short-lived Liberal drive). After 24 years as premier, Manning resigned in 1967.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Claudette was {{the third}} {{tropical}} storm and first hurricane of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. A fairly long-lived July Atlantic hurricane, Claudette began as a tropical wave in the eastern Caribbean. It moved quickly westward, brushing past the Yucatán Peninsula before moving northwestward through the Gulf of Mexico. Claudette remained a tropical storm until just before making landfall in Port O'Connor, Texas, when it quickly strengthened <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Forecasting of its path and intensity was uncertain throughout its lifetime, resulting in widespread and often unnecessary preparations along its path.|$|E

5|$|Late in {{the evening}} of September 18, Karl {{attained}} Category3 status, becoming the sixth major hurricane of 2004. On September 19, Karl continued to strengthen, maintaining a well-defined eye, and strengthening late that day into a Category4 hurricane with winds of 135mph (215km/h) and a minimum pressure of 948mbar. Early on September 20, the storm weakened slightly {{as a result of}} an eyewall replacement cycle, weakening back <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> Category3 hurricane. At this time Karl began to turn sharply northward into a weakness in the subtropical ridge.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Antillean {{music can}} be {{characterized}} by the prominence of the Carnival celebration (prominently from Trinidad and Tobago), {{and the importance of}} calypso-like song traditions.

Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in New York City, where Brooklyn's Labor Day Carnival features music and parades, mas and steel bands; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Edouard quickly strengthened {{due to the}} establishment of an upper-level anticyclone over the storm. The storm moved to the west in response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> subtropical ridge to its north, and Edouard strengthened into a hurricane on August 23. Due to very favorable conditions, the hurricane rapidly strengthened on August 24 and August 25 to peak as a 145mph (230km/h) Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. A weakness in the subtropical ridge allowed for a motion more to the west-northwest, and the hurricane passed about 250mi (400km) north of the Lesser Antilles on August 28. For three days during this time, Edouard maintained Category4 intensity, though weakened late on August 28 due to an eyewall replacement cycle and vertical shear.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time that Météo-France {{assessed}} Hondo to have peaked, the JTWC reported that the storm had attained winds of 230km/h (145mph 1-minute winds), equivalent <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> Category 4 hurricane. Shortly after reaching peak intensity, the cloud tops around the eye began to warm, meaning that the storm was beginning to weaken. Hondo also turned towards the southwest and kept a steady pace as two subtropical highs began influencing its movement. The storm continued to weaken as cloud tops warmed but remained an intense tropical cyclone as its eye was still well-defined. Hondo briefly re-intensified later on February8 despite the structure of the storm deteriorating. The cyclone maintained intense tropical cyclone status through February10 due to the formation of a large eye which helped maintain the storms structure. Hondo gradually began to weaken due to a combination of decreasing sea surface temperatures and increasing forward motion. On February10, Hondo started a gradual curving path due to a trough located to the south and strengthening high pressure systems to the north. At 0600UTC, the storm was downgraded to a tropical cyclone as winds decreased to 155km/h (100mph).|$|E

5|$|As Krovanh was {{approaching}} the Philippines, Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau cautioned {{the residents of}} the island against strong winds and warning ships in the Bashi Channel. After the typhoon entered the South China Sea, sea warnings were issued for areas offshore Hainan. Additional warnings were issued and expanded as Krovanh moved closer to the Chinese coast. In preparation for the storm, shipping routes across the Qiongzhou Strait were suspended, while security measures for river dykes and reservoirs were strengthened in both Hainan and Guangdong. In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a Standby Signal No.1 on August23, which was upgraded <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Strong</b> Wind Signal No.3 at around noon the following day. All warning signals in Hong Kong were discontinued on August25. In Guangzhou, 15flights were cancelled in anticipation of Krovanh, stranding 500passengers.|$|E
5|$|Barry {{then began}} a {{westerly}} course towards central Florida. However, wind shear began to increase, causing {{the system to}} weaken. The NHC downgraded the storm back to a tropical depression on August25. Barry made landfall near Melbourne, Florida the same morning with winds of 35mph (55km/h). After crossing Florida, the depression traveled towards the west-southwest due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> upper-level flow. On August27, Barry became sufficiently organized to be reclassified as a tropical storm while located in the central Gulf of Mexico. The re-strengthening {{was the result of}} decreased wind shear and more favorable conditions over the Gulf. The storm continued to become better organized as it traveled nearly due west towards Mexico. At 1200UTC the next day, Barry was upgraded to a hurricane while located about 75mi (120km) southeast of Brownsville, Texas. The hurricane continued to intensify until it made landfall about 35mi (55km) south-southeast of Brownsville at peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h). The storm quickly weakened after landfall and dissipated the next day over northern Mexico.|$|E
