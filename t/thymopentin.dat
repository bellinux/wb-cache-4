40|$|The {{interaction}} between the immune and endocrine systems has recently been investigated. Hodgkin's disease represents a model of immune disturbance frequently associated with endocrine impairment. The present study evaluated {{the effect of the}} acute administration of beta-interferon or <b>thymopentin</b> on plasma growth hormone, prolactin and cortisol levels in children with Hodgkin's disease (N = 8) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (N = 8). beta-interferon (1, 000, 000 IU), <b>thymopentin</b> (50 mg) or placebo (saline) were injected after two basal blood samples (- 15 and 0) and further samples were drawn at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min. Plasma growth hormone, prolactin and cortisol levels were measured by specific RIAs. Plasma prolactin levels did not show significant change following beta-interferon or <b>thymopentin</b> injection in either the controls or the patients. In the patients with Hodgkin's disease, beta-interferon injection induced a significant increase in both plasma growth hormone and cortisol levels, while <b>thymopentin</b> was not effective. In controls both <b>thymopentin</b> and beta-interferon administration increased plasma growth hormone and cortisol levels. These results indicate that beta-interferon and <b>thymopentin</b> are immune substances active on the release of growth hormone and cortisol in healthy children. The lack of effect of <b>thymopentin</b> in children with Hodgkin's disease suggests an impairment of the immune-endocrine interaction in these patients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{study the}} effect of immune formulation-assisted {{conventional}} therapy on anti-infective ability of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection mice. MethodsBALB/c mice were used as experimental animals, multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis infection models were built, randomly divided into model group, moxifloxacin group, <b>thymopentin</b> group and combined treatment group and given corresponding drug intervention, and then colony numbers in the spleen and lung, T lymphocyte subset contents and programmed death- 1 (PD- 1) expression levels in peripheral blood were detected. ResultsColony numbers in lung and spleen of moxifloxacin group and <b>thymopentin</b> group were significantly {{lower than those of}} model group and colony numbers in lung and spleen of combined treatment group were significantly lower than those of moxifloxacin group and <b>thymopentin</b> group; contents of CD 3 +CD 4 +T cells, Th 1 and Th 17 in peripheral blood of moxifloxacin group and <b>thymopentin</b> group were higher than those of model group, and contents of CD 3 +CD 8 +T cells, Th 2 and Treg were lower than those of model group; contents of CD 3 +CD 4 +T cells, Th 1 and Th 17 in peripheral blood of combined treatment group were higher than those of moxifloxacin group and <b>thymopentin</b> group, and contents of CD 3 +CD 8 +T cells, Th 2 and Treg were lower than those of moxifloxacin group and <b>thymopentin</b> group; PD- 1 expression levels on T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte and monocyte surface in peripheral blood of moxifloxacin group and <b>thymopentin</b> group were lower than those of model group, and PD- 1 expression levels on T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte and monocyte surface in peripheral blood of combined treatment group were lower than those of moxifloxacin group and <b>thymopentin</b> group.

40|$|Three {{pilot studies}} testing <b>thymopentin</b> in AIDS {{patients}} are presented. One study included 5 {{patients with the}} full-blown syndrome, all treated with 50 mg <b>thymopentin</b> 3 times a week by intravenous slow infusion; no immunologically nor clinically positive results were observed, indicating that the T cell pool in such patients is severely depleted. Six other patients with the prodromal stage of AIDS were treated 1 month with 50 mg <b>thymopentin</b> administered as an intravenous bolus injection 3 times weekly and thereafter for another month with same dose regimen as intravenous slow infusions. The patients on infusion therapy experienced statistically significant immunological improvements; these positive findings were paralleled with an improvement of the patients' clinical condition. These positive responses persisted {{for an average of}} 8 months. In another group of 5 pre-AIDS patients <b>thymopentin</b> was administered via the subcutaneous route using 15 mg 3 times weekly; only 1 patient revealed immunological and clinical improvement. In summary, only patients with the pre-AIDS syndrome are likely to benefit from immunomodulation therapy with <b>thymopentin,</b> and the mode of administration seems to be crucial.

40|$|An open {{clinical}} trial of <b>thymopentin</b> {{was conducted on}} 16 children with severe atopic dermatitis. The patients were treated with injections {{three times a week}} of 50 mg <b>thymopentin</b> for six weeks. They were then divided randomly into two groups: group A continued <b>thymopentin</b> for an additional six weeks, and group B were treated with normal saline. Clinical parameters and immunological function were evaluated serially. The total severity score started to decline from baseline significantly three weeks after treatment, and continued throughout the study period in group A but began to flare up in group B two weeks after stopping <b>thymopentin.</b> All the eight patients in group A completed the trial but three out of eight in group B dropped out because of flaring up of skin lesion. In vitro production of interleukin- 4 tended to decrease and that of interferon gamma tended to increase, but total serum IgE, in vitro IgE synthesis, and abnormally low CD 8 + CD 11 b+ suppressor T cells remained unchanged. Histamine releasing factor (HRF), plasma histamine, and respiratory burst activities of polymorphonuclear leucocytes were appreciably decreased after <b>thymopentin</b> treatment. It is concluded that the clinical efficacy of short term <b>thymopentin</b> treatment very possibly results from the decreased production of HRF and decreased release of polymorphonuclear leucocyte derived inflammatory mediators and may have no relation with antigen-IgE immune reaction...|$|E

Either 50 mg of <b>thymopentin</b> or of placebo was administered 3 times a week, by the subcutaneous route, for 6 weeks. Subsequently, the patients were observed for nearly 6 months on the average. The results achieved with <b>thymopentin</b> for the individual parameters were significantly superior to those obtained with placebo; thus significant improvement was seen in patients on <b>thymopentin</b> in {{the duration of the}} longest symptomfree period (prolonged from 2. 1 weeks to 20. 9 weeks, p = 0. 000), in the number of relapses (reduced from 1. 6 to 0. 4 episodes/month, p = 0. 001), and in the total duration of herpes symptoms per month (shortened from 2. 0 to 0. 3 weeks, p = 0. 000). Placebo treatment also resulted in considerable improvement (p < 0. 05 or 0. 01), but was significantly inferior to the improvement obtained with <b>thymopentin.</b> The longest symptomfree period in the placebo group was prolonged from 2. 4 to 11. 2 weeks. The number of relapses per month was reduced from 1. 4 to 0. 8, and the total duration of herpes symptoms per month from 2 to 0. 9 weeks. The results of intergroup analyses, in which the observed parameters and the improvement achieved in either group were compared, significantly favored <b>thymopentin</b> treatment.

The groups were comparable {{at the start of the}} study. Statistical tests of changes within the treatment groups after 3 weeks showed that the improvement achieved in the <b>thymopentin</b> group was significant (p less than 0. 05 or p less than 0. 01) for each clinical parameter, except for left-hand grip strength. On the other hand, no significant improvement was observed for any parameter except morning stiffness in the patients on placebo. The intergroup comparison showed significant differences, favouring <b>thymopentin</b> over placebo treatment, in the Ritchie index, scores for swollen joints, assessment of severity of pain and scores for changes in the activity of the disease. Only minor side-effects were experienced in the two treatment groups.

40|$|Thymic hormones {{have been}} shown to {{modulate}} immunoglobulin production in a number of experiments and it is generally agreed that this action is mediated by modulation of helper and/or suppressor T cell activities. The possibility of upregulating the immunoglobulins is of particular relevance in patients with hypogammaglobulinemias and this paper reports on the results of <b>thymopentin</b> treatment in 9 patients with selective IgA deficiency. Two out of 4 patients responded positively in an open-label trial; in one the serum IgA values remained stable up to 8 weeks after discontinuation of treatment whereas there was a rapid fall in the other. Both responders had consistently normal T 4 /T 8 ratios during the treatment, whereas the nonresponders revealed high ratios with large fluctuations of the T 4 /T 8 ratio.

40|$|Objective: To {{discuss the}} {{curative}} effect of <b>thymopentin</b> combined with conventional chemotherapy {{in the treatment}} of relapsing pulmonary tuberculosis(RPTB) with sputum smear positive and its influence to the respiratory function and immune function of patients. Method: A total of 138 cases of patients with relapsing pulmonary tuberculosis(RPTB) with sputum smear positive were divided randomly. And they were divided into control group and study group (n= 69), 2 HRZE/ 4 HR conventional chemotherapy for control group, while <b>thymopentin</b> combined with conventional chemotherapy for study group. To compare the sputum negative conversion rate, lesions absorption rate, void closure reduction rate, lung function and immune function index and serum inflammatory factor level changes of both groups. Results: 6 months after treatment, the sputum negative conversion rate, lesions absorption rate, void closure reduction rate in study group were obviously higher than that in control group; lung function index-FVC, FEV 1 and FEV 1 /FVC and T lymphocyte CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 4 +/CD 8 + level in study group were obviously higher than before treatment and that in control group; serum inflammatory factor IL- 10 level in study group was obviously lower than before treatment and that in control group; but IFN-æ¯­ level in study group was obviously higher than before treatment and that in control group.

Methods: In 42 women with chronically recurrent and 20 women with acute Candida albicans vulvovaginitis, as well as 14 women with C. glabrata vaginitis, the following investigations were carried out: identification of yeast. species; quantification ofT lymphocytes and their subpopulations in sera; proliferation tests of T lymphocytes in vitro; treatment of 18 patients with chronically recurrent vaginal candidosis with the synthetic T-lymphocyte- stimulator thymopentin; and, finally, control of the above-mentioned parameters in the clinical course. Results: Women with C. albicans vulvovaginitis showed fewer T lymphocytes and subpopulations in the peripheral blood than healthy women. Only the number of non-specific killer (NK) cells, however, was significantly lower in cases of acute C. albicans vulvovaginitis. In women with C. glabrata vaginitis, the number of T lymphocytes in the blood was within the normal range. In vitro proliferation tests using mitogens, bacterial antigens, and commercially available candida antigens with and without addition of <b>thymopentin</b> were carried out on the T lymphocytes of women with chronically recurrent C. albicans vulvovaginitis.

A. 2000, 97, 5802 â 5806), we provided a proof-of-principle for fold recognition of proteins using a homobifunctional amine-specific chemical crosslinking reagent {{in combination with}} mass spectrometry analysis and homology modeling. In this current work, we propose a systematic nomenclature to describe the types of peptides that are generated after proteolysis of crosslinked proteins, their fragmentation by tandem mass spectrometry, and an automated algorithm for MS/MS spectral assignment called âMS 2 Assign. â Several examples are provided from crosslinked peptides and proteins including HIV-integrase, cytochrome c, ribonuclease A, myoglobin, cytidine 5 -monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase, and the peptide <b>thymopentin.</b> Tandem mass spectra were obtained from various crosslinked peptides using post source decay MALDI-TOF and collision induced dissociation on a quadrupole-TOF instrument, along with their automated interpretation using MS 2 Assign. A variety of possible outcomes are described and categorized according {{to the number of}} modified lysines and/or peptide chains involved, as well as the presence of singly modified (dead-end) lysine residues. In addition, the proteolysis and chromatographic conditions necessary for optimized crosslinked peptide recovery are presented...|$|E
40|$|Although it is {{now well}} {{established}} that cells {{of the immune system}} express most of the exopeptidases described so far, little information is available concerning the identification and the characterization of the peptidases associated with the surface of human thymocytes. In the present study we have focused on CD 10 expression on thymocytes using both FACS and enzymatic analysis. Unfractionated intact human thymocytes were shown to express significant levels of CD 10 -specific enzymatic activity, as assessed by the hydrolysis of the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Phe-pNA and of D-Ala 2 -Leu-enkephalin, a typical NEP substrate. CD 10 activity was abolished by specific NEP inhibitors, including thiorphan, retrothiorphan and phosphoramidon. Moreover, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that intact thymocytes and purified NEP hydrolysed <b>thymopentin,</b> a thymic factor known to induce the maturation of prothymocytes into thymocytes. Finally, CD 10 /NEP was preferentially associated with CD 3 - CD 3 low and immature CD 4 - CD 8 - thymocytes. The data demonstrate {{for the first time that}} human thymocytes express functional NEP and suggest a role for this enzyme in the maturation of human thymocytes...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} thymosyn alpha 1 (Talpha 1) and <b>thymopentin</b> (TP 5) on the cocaine-induced {{impairment}} {{of the primary}} antibody response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) was studied. The administration of cocaine from day - 4 to the day of immunization (day 0) induced a significant impairment of {{the response to the}} T-dependent antigen SRBC, as evaluated on day 5 post-immunization by the Splenocyte-Induced SRBC Hemolysis (SIH) assay. The analysis of the responses to immunogen elicited from each single mouse indicated that, under the experimental conditions used, cocaine acted by exerting more an ''all or nothing'' effect rather than by modulating the strength of the immune response. Both Talpha 1 and TP 5, injected into mice during cocaine administration and for 4 days after, induced a significant recovery of the response to SRBC. Our experiments did not show any great differences in the overall efficacy of the two drugs, although they showed quite a different dose-response effect. The results of the present investigation demonstrated the capability of TP 5 and Talpha 1 to reverse the cocaine-induced impairment of the response to SRBC and suggested that the effect of the two peptides may be related to their immunomodulating activities on T-cell functions...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{production}} of gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) by {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (MNC) {{was measured using}} a specific radioimmunoassay in 16 patients presenting with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in 14 patients with inactive disease, and in 36 control subjects (CS). Unstimulated cultures produced undetectable levels of gamma-IFN and did not incorporate tritiated thymidine. In response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) 0. 2 microgram/ml, MNC from active RA produced 9 times less, and under PHA 2. 5 micrograms/ml, 4 times less gamma-IFN than did MNC from inactive RA or from CS. The uptake of tritiated thymidine was, however, similar in the 3 groups. In unstimulated cultures of the 3 groups, <b>thymopentin</b> (TP- 5), at all concentrations tested, did not influence either the levels of gamma-IFN or the uptake of tritiated thymidine. In the presence of PHA 0. 2 microgram/ml and TP- 5, lambda-IFN levels were increased in CS, unchanged in inactive RA and reduced in active RA, whereas no changes were observed in the uptake of tritiated thymidine. Our results show that under our experimental conditions, TP- 5 was able to increase the levels of gamma-IFN produced by normal MNC in vitro, but could not reverse the profound defect observed in active RA.

40|$|Background Purified thymus {{extracts}} (pTE) {{and synthetic}} thymic peptides (sTP) {{are thought to}} enhance the immune system of cancer patients in order to fight the growth of tumour cells and to resist infections due to immunosuppression induced by the disease and antineoplastic therapy. Objectives To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} pTE and sTP for the management of cancer. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, BIOETHICSLINE, BIOSIS, CATLINE, CISCOM, HEALTHSTAR, HTA, SOMED and LILACS (to February 2010). Selection criteria Randomised trials of pTE or sTP in addition to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both, compared to the same regimen with placebo or no additional treatment in adult cancer patients. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data from published trials. We derived odds ratios (OR) from overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates, tumour response (TR) rates, and rates of adverse effects (AE) related to antineoplastic treatments. We used a random-effects model for meta-analysis. Main results We identified 26 trials (2736 patients). Twenty trials investigated pTE (thymostimulin or thymosin fraction 5) and six trials investigated sTP (<b>thymopentin</b> or thymosin Î± 1). Twenty-one trials reported results for OS, six for DFS, 14 for TR, nine for AE and 10 for safety of pTE and sTP. Addition of pTE conferred no benefit on OS (RR 1. 00, 95...|$|E
40|$|Formulation {{of protein}} and peptide drugs with {{sustained}} release properties {{is crucial to}} enhance their therapeutic effect and minimize administration frequency. In this study, immunomodulating polymeric systems were designed by manufacturing PHBHHx nanoparticles (NPs) containing <b>thymopentin</b> (TP 5). The release profile of the drug was studied {{over a period of}} 7 days. The PHBHHx NPs containing TP 5 -phospholipid (PLC) complex (TP 5 -PLC) displayed a spherical shape with a mean size, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency of 238. 9 nm, - 32. 0 mV, and 72. 81, respectively. The cytotoxicity results showed the PHBHHx NPs had a relatively low toxicity in vitro. TP 5 entrapped in the NPs could hardly release in vitro, while the NPs had longer than 7 days release duration after a single subcutaneous injection in Wistar rats. The immunodepression rat model was built to evaluate the immunomodulating effects of TP 5 -PLC-NPs in vivo. The results of T-lymphocyte subsets (CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CD 4 +/CD 8 + ratio) analysis and superoxide dismutase (SOD) values suggested that TP 5 -PLC-NPs had stronger immunoregulation effects than TP 5 solution. In conclusion, an applicable approach to markedly enhancing the loading of a water-soluble peptide into a hydrophobic polymer matrix has been introduced. Thus, TP 5 -PLC-NPs are promising nanomedicine systems for sustained release effects of TP 5. ÃÂ© 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe human promyelocytic {{cell line}} HL- 60 can be {{differentiated}} with retinoic acid (RA) along the granulocytic pathway. Numerous studies have identified many synergistic combinations of RA with cytostatics, cytokines and other inducers. A combination of RA with the crude thymus extract Thymex-L increased differentiation of HL- 60 cells as confirmed by two functional assays and morphology, whereas the extract itself {{did not show}} any effect. The functional markers phagocytosis-associated chemiluminescence and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction were more enhanced (up to 4 -fold with 1000 Î¼g/ml Thymex-L) than morphology. The effect was found over a wide RA concentration range (10 â 11 â 10 â 6 M) and was dependent on extract concentration. The half-maximal induction of both functional markers was reached at 400 Î¼g/ml. To achieve the same effect with the combination in comparison with RA alone, an RA dose reduction of about 100 -fold was estimated. The effect was also seen when the cells were pretreated with the thymus extract for two days. The enhancement of RA action by Thymex-L was not correlated with an increase of extracellular or intracellular RA concentration. The active compound in Thymex-L is heat stable and bigger than 5 kDa as confirmed by gelfiltration. The defined thymus peptides thymosin Î± 1, prothymosin Î± 1 and <b>thymopentin</b> were unable to synergistically enhance HL- 60 differentiation. These {{data suggest that the}} treatment with a thymus extract can increase the sensitivity of HL- 60 cells for RA. This may have clinical implications...|$|E
40|$|Free radical {{polymerization}} {{is often used}} to prepare protein and peptide-loaded hydrogels for the design of controlled release systems and molecular imprinting materials. Peroxodisulfates (ammonium peroxodisulfates (APS) or potassium peroxodisulfates (KPS)) with N,N,N,N-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) are frequently used as initiator and catalyst. However, exposure to these free {{radical polymerization}} reagents may lead to modification of the protein and peptide. In this work, we show the modification of lysine residues by ammonium peroxodisulfate (APS) /TEMED of the immunostimulant <b>thymopentin</b> (TP 5). Parallel studies on a decapeptide and a library of 15 dipeptides were performed to reveal the mechanism of modification. LC-MS of APS/TEMED-exposed TP 5 revealed a major reaction product with an increased mass (+ 12 Da) with respect to TP 5. LC-MS 2 and LC-MS 3 were performed to obtain structural information on the modified peptide and localize the actual modification site. Interpretation of the obtained data demonstrates the formation of a methylene bridge between the lysine and arginine residue in the presence of TEMED, while replacing TEMED with a sodium bisulfite catalyst did not show this modification. Studies with the other peptides showed that the TEMED radical can induce methyleneation on peptides when lysine is next to arginine, proline, cysteine, aspargine, glutamine, histidine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and aspartic acid residues. Stability of peptides and protein needs to be considered when using APS/TEMED in in situ polymerization systems. The use of an alternative catalyst such as sodium bisulfite may preserve the chemical integrity of peptides during in situ polymerization...|$|E
