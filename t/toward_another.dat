5|$|Samarium forms a cyclopentadienide Sm(C5H5)3 and its chloroderivatives Sm(C5H5)2Cl and Sm(C5H5)Cl2. They are {{prepared}} by reacting samarium trichloride with NaC5H5 in tetrahydrofuran. Contrary to cyclopentadienides {{of most other}} lanthanides, in Sm(C5H5)3 some C5H5 rings bridge each other by forming ring vertexes η1 or edges η2 <b>toward</b> <b>another</b> neighboring samarium atom, thereby creating polymeric chains. The chloroderivative Sm(C5H5)2Cl has a dimer structure, which is more accurately expressed as (η5-C5H5)2Sm(µ-Cl)2(η5-C5H5)2. There, the chlorine bridges can be replaced, for instance, by iodine, hydrogen or nitrogen atoms or by CN groups.|$|E

25|$|A {{photomultiplier}} is a phototube whose sensitivity {{is greatly}} increased {{through the use}} of electron multiplication. This works on the principle of secondary emission, whereby a single electron emitted by the photocathode strikes a special sort of anode known as a dynode causing more electrons to be released from that dynode. Those electrons are accelerated <b>toward</b> <b>another</b> dynode at a higher voltage, releasing more secondary electrons; as many as 15 such stages provide a huge amplification. Despite great advances in solid-state photodetectors, the single-photon detection capability of photomultiplier tubes makes this vacuum tube device excel in certain applications. Such a tube can also be used for detection of ionizing radiation {{as an alternative to the}} Geiger–Müller tube (itself not an actual vacuum tube). Historically, the image orthicon TV camera tube widely used in television studios prior to the development of modern CCD arrays also used multistage electron multiplication.|$|E

However, the new Tansykbaev is also encrusted in a patina of hierarchical obedience and interpersonal tyranny; unmoved by the procession's request, he denies them entry and also informs them that the Ana-Beiit cemetery is to be leveled in the future.|$|E
500|$|Proserpine is a verse {{drama in}} blank verse by Mary Shelley which {{includes}} two lyric poems by Percy Shelley. In {{the early nineteenth}} century, lyric poetry was associated with male poets, and quotidian poetry (i.e., the poetry of the everyday) with female poets. The division of labour in Proserpine reflects this trend. Percy's poems help emphasise the mythic nature of Proserpine's story; he continued this transcendental description of Proserpine in his Prometheus Unbound. Mary's drama consists of carefully described objects, such as flowers. Furthermore, her characters do not speak in soliloquy—except in Percy's poems—rather, [...] "nearly every speech is directed feelingly <b>toward</b> <b>another</b> character and is typically concerned with describing another's emotional state, and/or eliciting an emotional reaction." [...] Dialogue in Proserpine is founded on empathy, not the conflict more typical of drama. Mary Shelley also refused to embrace the visual sensationalism of early nineteenth-century theatre, focusing instead on [...] "scenes of heightened emotion".|$|E
500|$|Cameron was {{an atheist}} {{in his early}} teens. When he was 17, {{during the height of}} his career on Growing Pains, he became a born-again Christian. After {{converting}} to Christianity, he began to insist that storylines be edited to remove anything he thought too adult or inappropriate in Growing Pains. After the series was cancelled, Cameron did not maintain contact with his former co-stars, and did not speak to Tracey Gold for eight years. Cameron has stated that this was not due to any animosity on his part toward any of his former cast-members, but an outgrowth of his desire {{to start a new life}} away from the entertainment industry, and the life he had been in for the previous seven years. Prior to the premiere of The Growing Pains Movie in 2000, for which the entire main cast reunited, Cameron described his regrets over how his relationship with his castmates changed after his religious conversion during production of the series, saying, [...] "I definitely kind of made an about-face, going <b>toward</b> <b>another</b> aspect of my life", admits Cameron. [...] "I shifted my focus from 100% on the show, to 100% on , and left 0% on the show—and even the friendships that were a part of that show. If I could go back, I think I could make decisions that were less inadvertently hurtful to the cast—like talking and explaining to them why I just wanted to have my family at my wedding." ...|$|E

500|$|In Greek {{the gesture}} {{was known as}} the katapygon (κατάπυγον, from kata – κατά, [...] "downwards" [...] and pugē – πυγή, [...] "rump, buttocks"). In ancient Greek comedy, the finger was a gesture of insult <b>toward</b> <b>another</b> person, with the term katapugon also {{referring}} to [...] "a male who submits to anal penetration" [...] or katapygaina to a female. In Aristophanes's comedy The Clouds (423 BC), when the character Socrates is quizzing his student on poetic meters, Strepsiades declares that he knows quite well what a dactyl is, and gives the finger. The gesture is a visual pun on the two meanings of the Greek word dactylos, both [...] "finger" [...] and the rhythmic measure composed of a long syllable and two short, like the joints of a finger ( [...] which also appears as a visual pun on the penis and testicles in a medieval Latin text). Socrates reacts to the gesture as boorish and childish. The gesture recurs as a form of mockery in Peace, alongside farting in someone's face; the usage is later explained in the Suda and included in the Adagia of Erasmus. The verb [...] "to play the Siphnian" [...] appears in a fragment of Aristophanes and has a similar meaning; the usage is once again explained in the Suda, where it is said to mean [...] "to touch the anus with a finger". Diogenes Laërtius records how the Cynic philosopher Diogenes of Sinope directed the gesture at the orator Demosthenes in 4th-century BC Athens. In the Discourses of Epictetus, Diogenes's target is instead one of the sophists.|$|E

2500|$|A third kind of jury, {{known as}} a coroner's jury can be convened in some common law {{jurisdiction}} in connection with an inquest by a coroner.

[...] A coroner's jury is generally a body that a coroner can convene on an optional basis {{in order to increase}} public confidence in the coroner's finding where there might otherwise be a controversy. [...] In practice, coroner's juries are most often convened {{in order to avoid the}} appearance of impropriety by one governmental official in the criminal justice system <b>toward</b> <b>another</b> if no charges are filed against the person causing the death, when a governmental party such as a law enforcement officer is involved in the death.|$|E

Harris knelt down and shot Shoels once in the chest at close range, killing him instantly. Klebold also knelt down and opened fire, hitting and killing Kechter. Harris then yelled; [...] "Who's ready to die next?". Meanwhile, Scott was uninjured; he lay in the blood of his friends, feigning death. Harris turned and threw a CO2 bomb at the table where Hall, Steepleton, and Ireland were located. It landed on Steepleton's thigh, and Hall quickly threw it away.|$|E
2500|$|Whether {{or not it}} is all-encompassing in so doing, Newtonian {{mechanics}} deals {{only with}} caused events, e.g.: If an object begins in a known position and is hit dead on by an object with some known velocity, then it will be pushed straight <b>toward</b> <b>another</b> predictable point. If it goes somewhere else, the Newtonians argue, one must question one's measurements of the original position of the object, the exact direction of the striking object, gravitational or other fields that were inadvertently ignored, etc. Then, they maintain, repeated experiments and improvements in accuracy will always bring one's observations closer to the theoretically predicted results. When dealing with situations on an ordinary human scale, Newtonian physics has been so enormously successful that it has no competition. But it fails spectacularly as velocities become some substantial fraction of the speed of light and when interactions at the atomic scale are studied. Before the discovery of quantum effects and other challenges to Newtonian physics, [...] "uncertainty" [...] was always a term that applied to the accuracy of human knowledge about causes and effects, and not to the causes and effects themselves.|$|E
2500|$|The central {{component}} of effective caregiving is the taking on of what Batson (1991) called an empathic stance <b>toward</b> <b>another</b> person's suffering or needs. This means adopting the perspective, or [...] "putting oneself in the shoes", of the partner {{in order to}} help lessen his or her distress in a stressful situation, or to help him or her pursue personal growth and development goals in challenging contexts. The empathic stance is characterized by two key, related components: sensitivity and responsiveness (although note that these terms are sometimes used interchangeably in the caregiving and social support literatures). [...] Sensitivity refers to the ability to effectively detect and interpret the partner's cues of distress, worry, or need, and to provide the type and amount of support that is well matched to the partner's wants and needs. This tailoring of caregiving efforts to the particular characteristics of the specific situation is essential for effective care. Responsiveness is the ability to provide support {{in a way that makes}} the partner feel understood (i.e., the caregiver has accurately captured the speaker's problem, needs, and emotions), validated (i.e., the caregiver confirms that the care recipient is a valued individual and that his or her feelings and responses in the situation are reasonable), and cared for (i.e., caregiver should communicate affection and concern). Caregiving that lacks these two components may be ineffective or even detrimental to the care-recipient's well-being. For example, a study investigating the adjustment of breast cancer patients found that these women varied in the types of the support they desired, and mismatches between the type of support wanted and the type of support received (i.e., low sensitivity to the partner’s unique support needs) predicted worse adjustment. [...] Unhelpful attempts at social support include: minimization (e.g., downplaying or denying the problem), maximization (e.g., catastrophizing, making the problem seem unwieldy or unresolvable), blaming or criticizing the partner for their misfortune, inducing feelings of guilt or indebtedness, [...] and overinvolvement (e.g., being overly protective, making the care-recipient feel incompetent, inserting oneself into the problem when the partner wishes to solve it independently).|$|E
