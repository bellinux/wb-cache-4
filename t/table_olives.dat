An olive's cultivar has {{a significant impact on}} its colour, size, shape, and growth characteristics, as well as the qualities of olive oil.

25|$|The {{curing process}} may take {{from a few}} days, with lye, to a few months with brine or salt packing. With the {{exception}} of California style and salt-cured olives, all methods of curing involve a major fermentation involving bacteria and yeast that is of equal importance to the final table olive product. Traditional cures, using the natural microflora on the fruit to induce fermentation, lead to two important outcomes: the leaching out and breakdown of oleuropein and other unpalatable phenolic compounds, and the generation of favourable metabolites from bacteria and yeast, such as organic acids, probiotics, glycerol, and esters, which affect the sensory properties of the final <b>table</b> <b>olives.</b> Mixed bacterial/yeast olive fermentations may have probiotic qualities. Lactic acid {{is the most important}} metabolite, as it lowers the pH, acting as a natural preservative against the growth of unwanted pathogenic species. The result is <b>table</b> <b>olives</b> which can be stored without refrigeration. Fermentations dominated by lactic acid bacteria are, therefore, the most suitable method of curing olives. Yeast-dominated fermentations produce a different suite of metabolites which provide poorer preservation, so they are corrected with an acid such as citric acid in the final processing stage to provide microbial stability.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the olive}} (Olea europaea sativa l.) is {{considered}} a xerophytic species, long periods of water stress and high temperatures during summer months can greatly affect plant physiology and productivity. In recent years, the use of plant-based water status indicators have become popular {{in the study of}} plant-water relationships and in the design of irrigation programs, particularly midday stem water potential (ψstem). The current trend in the irrigation of olive trees is in the development of Deficit Irrigation (DI) systems whereby the water is applied at a rate which is lower than evapotranspiration needs, resulting in only very small reductions in yield. Rather than working towards minimizing crop water deficits, an irrigation manager must decide on what level of deficit to allow and must recognize when that level has been reached. Traditionally, olive trees in Sicily are not watered, with the exception of those destined for the <b>table</b> <b>olive</b> industry. Considering the growth of the <b>table</b> <b>olive</b> industry in Sicily, the choice of a correct irrigation management related to the olive tree stress threshold is necessary in order to save water. In the Belice Valley, where the <b>table</b> <b>olive</b> cultivar Nocellara del Belice is cultivated, irrigation is still managed traditionally, {{with a high level of}} variability and water waste. This trial, conducted in two consecutive olive crop seasons (2010 and 2011) aimed to evaluate the effects of deficit irrigation management on tree physiology, yield and fruit quality of the <b>table</b> <b>olive</b> cultivar Nocellara del Belice...|$|R

2500|$|Spanish or Sevillian type (olives with fermentation): Most {{commonly}} {{applied to}} green olive preparation, around 60% {{of all the}} world's <b>table</b> <b>olives</b> are produced with this method. Olives are soaked in lye (dilute NaOH, 2–4%) for 8–10 hours to hydrolyse the oleuropein. They are usually considered [...] "treated" [...] when the lye has penetrated {{two-thirds of the way}} into the fruit. They are then washed once or several times in water to remove the caustic solution and transferred to fermenting vessels full of brine at typical concentrations of 8–12% NaCl. The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds. Fermentation is carried out by the natural microbiota present on the olives that survive the lye treatment process. Many organisms are involved, usually reflecting the local conditions or [...] "Terroir" [...] of the olives. During a typical fermentation gram-negative enterobacteria flourish in small numbers at first, but are rapidly outgrown by lactic acid bacteria species such as Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Pediococcus damnosus. These bacteria produce lactic acid to help lower the pH of the brine and therefore stabilize the product against unwanted pathogenic species. A diversity of yeasts then accumulate in sufficient numbers to help complete the fermentation alongside the lactic acid bacteria. Yeasts commonly mentioned include the teleomorphs Pichia anomala, Pichia membranifaciens, Debaryomyces hansenii and Kluyveromyces marxianus. Once fermented, the olives are placed in fresh brine and acid corrected, to be ready for market.|$|E

The objective of this experiment {{was to determine the}} effect of different regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies on productivity, oil quality and water-use efficiency on olive grown in the Sonoran Desert. The experiments were carried out in 2009 and 2010, and in a ten years old traditional (10 × 5 m) “Manzanilla ” olive orchard. The control treatment was irrigated at 100 % ETc during the whole season while RDI treatments were applied at 75 % ETc or 50 % ETc.
