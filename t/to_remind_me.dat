500|$|Price Peterson of TV.com {{also gave}} a {{positive}} review, writing in his episode verdict that [...] "It's frankly {{amazing how much}} information this episode packed into 42 minutes while still feeling breezy and funny…The episode also ended with that breathtakingly horrifying ending, a multiple-death shocker that served <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> just how murder-lute Season 1 was." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B+". Alan Sepinwall wrote that the season premiere was [...] "a little heavy on the exposition" [...] while also commenting that {{the same could be}} said about the pilot episode. Sepinwall went on to state, [...] "I'm really enjoying all the new storylines and characters." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for Polygon, Eric Watson {{said that}} [...] "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s fourth season pulls the best {{elements}} from the MCU {{and the most}} over-the-top elements from comics <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> why I love Marvel: superheroes punching Nazis." [...] He said this was refreshing after the controversial comic storyline Secret Empire which sees the patriotic Captain America revealed to be a sleeper agent for Hydra. Carli Velocci at TheWrap also discussed the season in relation to Secret Empire, noting that Agents of Hydra [...] "hasn’t spawned a digital mountain of outrage" [...] like the commic event. She said that Secet Empire [...] "all but ignores [...] real world context, minus acknowledging that Nazis tend to like concentration camps. If anything, it treats the subject matter like window dressing, background for a plot intended to blow readers’ minds ... Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, however, embraces that real world context. It does everything it can {{to ensure that the}} real world still matters and that the audience understands the negative consequences of a Nazi-driven society. And unlike the comic book counterpart, it doesn’t shy away from the fact that Hydra is definitely rooted in the Third Reich." [...] She continued that the series [...] "manages to create a world where Hydra is the establishment, but every other plot point is about questioning it explicitly" [...] and [...] "what’s more inspiring than seeing an actual symbol of America not taking crap from Nazis? Wherever the comic series takes Captain America, it shouldn’t have lost sight of that. Fortunately, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. didn’t." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Federal Bureau of Prisons {{allowed the}} media to take {{a guided tour of}} ADX on September 14, 2007. Attending reporters remarked on [...] "an {{astonishing}} and eerie quiet" [...] within the prison as well as a sense of safety due to the rigorous security measures in place within the facility. One journalist who took the tour, 60 Minutes producer Henry Schuster, said: [...] "A few minutes inside that cell and two hours inside Supermax were enough <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> why I left high school a year early. The walls close in very fast." ...|$|E
2500|$|Events {{representative}} of cruel treatment of governesses and of women recur throughout [...] Agnes Grey. Additionally, Brontë depicts scenes of cruelty towards animals, {{as well as}} degrading treatment of Agnes. Parallels have been drawn between the oppression of these two groups—animals and females—that are [...] "beneath" [...] the upper class human male. To Anne, the treatment of animals reflected {{on the character of}} the person. This theme of oppression provided social commentary, likely based on Anne's experiences. Twenty years after its publication Lady Amberly commented that [...] "I should like to give it to every family with a governess and shall read it through again when I have a governess <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> to be human." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although his terse one-liners {{are well}} known, {{he is also}} known for having a dark sense of humour. On the 20th lap of the 2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Räikkönen had just taken the lead from Lewis Hamilton and his race {{engineer}} Simon Rennie advised that Fernando Alonso was five seconds behind {{and that he would}} be kept informed of Alonso's pace; Räikkönen replied, [...] "Just leave me alone, I know what I'm doing!" [...] Later in the same race, he admonished his team again, when being told to manage the tyre temperature: [...] "Yes, yes, yes, yes, I'm doing that all the time. You don't have <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> every ten seconds!" [...] The first quote attracted significant press coverage, and Räikkönen made no attempt to apologise in the post-race interview. It was earlier reported that he printed 500 T-shirts with the quote for the entire Lotus team, but this was later invalidated by Räikkönen in an interview with an FOM media personnel. The quote is also featured on his official website.|$|E

2500|$|From {{then on the}} writer's {{visits to}} the Palace became rare, but he used each one as an {{opportunity}} to [...] "speak the truth regardless," [...] as he put it. In 1862 Tolstoy solicited for Ivan Aksakov who'd been banned from editing his Den (The Day) newspaper. A year later he helped Ivan Turgenev out of an exile the latter found himself in after having contacted the [...] "London propagandists", as Alexander Herzen and Nikolay Ogarev were then known. In 1864 Tolstoy tried to exert his influence upon Alexander II to make him alleviate the plight of the imprisoned Chernyshevsky. Asked by the Tsar for the latest news in the world of literature, Tolstoy said: [...] "The whole of Russia has gone into mourning for Chernyshevsky to whom an injustice has been done..." [...] - [...] "No, Tolstoy, I beg you never <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> of Chernyshevsky, please," [...] the monarch hastily retorted. This aborted conversation, as it happened, brought to an end a friendship that had lasted for forty years.|$|E
2500|$|Across that {{threshold}} I {{had been}} afraid to cross, things suddenly seemed so very simple. There was but a single vision, God, who was all in all; there was but one will that directed all things, God's will. [...] I had only to see it, to discern it in every circumstance in which I found myself, and let myself be ruled by it. [...] God is in all things, sustains all things, directs all things. [...] To discern this in every situation and circumstance, to see His will in all things, was to accept each circumstance and situation and let oneself be borne along in perfect confidence and trust. [...] Nothing could separate me from Him, because He was in all things. No danger could threaten me, no fear could shake me, except the fear of losing sight of Him. [...] The future, hidden as it was, was hidden in His will and therefore acceptable to me {{no matter what it}} might bring. [...] The past, with all its failures, was not forgotten; it remained <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> of the weakness of human nature and the folly of putting any faith in self. [...] But it no longer depressed me. [...] I looked no longer to self to guide me, relied on it no longer in any way, so it could not again fail me. By renouncing, finally and completely, all control of my life and future destiny, I was relieved as a consequence of all responsibility. I was freed thereby from anxiety and worry, from every tension, and could float serenely upon the tide of God's sustaining providence in perfect peace of soul.|$|E
2500|$|Rumors {{began to}} {{circulate}} {{alleging that the}} Buccaneers were a disorganized and confused organization, and returning veterans were promised that changes were forthcoming. It was pointed out {{that none of the}} team's administrative staff had any experience in their position, {{at the same time that}} a team of rookie players and coaches was being fielded. These problems were addressed with the firings and resignations of six coaches and administrators at the beginning of the year. Head coach John McKay used the opportunity to take control of more aspects of the organization, and selected replacements of his choosing. McKay was criticized over his handling of the players, and was accused of cutting veterans who could have helped the team, such as Ira Gordon, over ego conflicts. A perception arose that McKay was intolerant toward challenges to his authority, as he frequently cut players who argued with him, and surrounded himself with former USC players and staff. Concern that McKay preferred players who would keep their mouth shut, rather than players with talent, produced resentment among veterans who worried that their limited career spans would be spent with a losing team. Critics accused McKay of attempting a style of play that was more appropriate for the college game, and noted Don Shula's comment that preparing for the Buccaneers was like preparing to play USC. Reporters who covered the team indicated that McKay did not respond to the losing streak with the humor that it was hoped he would, but that he became an [...] "old grouch" [...] who complained about his coaching assistants, game-day officiating, and opposing coaches who he accused of running up the score. This was reflected in a bitter tone that had crept into McKay's trademark humor, with comments such as [...] "I keep a picture of O.J. Simpson by my side at all times <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> of the days when I knew how to coach".|$|E
