25|$|To prevent scarring, it is {{prudent to}} {{periodically}} inspect the brake pads for wear. A <b>tire</b> <b>rotation</b> {{is a logical}} time for inspection, since rotation must be performed regularly based on vehicle operation time and all wheels must be removed, allowing ready visual access to the brake pads. Some types of alloy wheels and brake arrangements will provide enough open space to view the pads without removing the wheel. When practical, pads that are near the wear-out point should be replaced immediately, as complete wear out leads to scarring damage and unsafe braking. Many disc brake pads will include some sort of soft steel spring or drag tab {{as part of the}} pad assembly, which is designed to start dragging on the disc when the pad is nearly worn out. The result is a moderately loud metallic squealing noise, alerting the vehicle user that service is required, and this will not normally scar the disc if the brakes are serviced promptly. A set of pads can be considered for replacement if the thickness of the pad material is the same or less than the thickness of the backing steel. In Pennsylvania, the standard is 1/32".|$|E

50|$|In {{some cases}} (for example, BMW), {{automobile}} manufacturers may recommend performing no <b>tire</b> <b>rotation</b> at all.

5000|$|By 1984, Pontiac was in {{the midst}} of a {{resurgence}} as the division began to reassert its 1960s role as GM's performance brand. The 6000STE (Special Touring Edition) was introduced for the 1983 model year. 5-passenger seating with front captain seats and power windows were standard on this trim level (optional on some other trim levels). It featured a High-Output version of the 6000's optional 2.8 L V6. Like that engine, it sported a 2-barrel carburetor, though it delivered 135 horsepower, rather than the usual 112 horsepower. Although intended to compete with similar entries from BMW and Audi, the 6000 used older technologies by comparison. The fuel system was carbureted (competitors had fuel injection) and gauge cluster lacked a tachometer. The 1984 6000STE featured a digital gauge cluster featuring a bar-graph tachometer. The STE featured a driver information center with a system which monitored functions such as lights, doors, tune-ups and <b>tire</b> <b>rotations.</b> For 1984, Road and Track called the 6000 STE one of the top twelve enthusiast cars.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "two-tier" [...] {{instrument}} panel {{from the previous}} generation saw a significant redesign. All models (except for the base model DX) come with an Intelligent Multi-Informational Display (iMiD), situated on the enlarged upper tier {{and to the right}} of the digital speedometer. The 5-inch color LCD screen replaces the trip computer below the analog tachometer on the lower tier while integrating information of the vehicle with that from compatible personal electronics and steering wheel controls. It displays information such as current odometer and trip mileage, time and date, fuel economy, audio system, climate control information, and more. The Maintenance Minder now includes interval reminders for scheduled maintenance, such as air filter, cabin pollen filter, <b>tire</b> <b>rotations,</b> drive belt inspections as well as an oil change reminder. It will display an alphanumeric code, which is listed in the owners manual, signifying maintenance for the identified item is due. Owners who do their own maintenance can be reminded and the feature can be easily reset after the maintenance has been performed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tire</b> <b>rotation</b> is the {{practice}} of moving the wheels and tires of an automobile from one position to another, to ensure even tire wear. Even tire wear is desirable to extend the useful life {{of a set of}} tires.|$|E
5000|$|Front tires, {{especially}} on {{front wheel drive}} vehicles, {{have a tendency to}} wear out more quickly than rear tires. Routine maintenance including <b>tire</b> <b>rotation</b> (exchanging the front and rear tires with each other) is often done periodically to facilitate uniform tire wear.|$|E
50|$|Car {{manufacturers}} {{will recommend}} <b>tire</b> <b>rotation</b> frequency and pattern. <b>Tire</b> <b>rotation</b> is often recommended every 5,000 mi (≈8,000 km) to 8,000 mi(≈13,000 km), however this will differ between tire manufacturers and car makes. The rotation pattern is typically moving the back wheels to the front, {{and the front}} to the back, but crossing them when moving to the back. If the tires are unidirectional, the rotation can only be rotated front to back {{on the same side}} of the vehicle to preserve the rotational direction of the tires. Most unidirectional tires can be moved from side to side if they are remounted; tires with asymmetric rims are a rare exception. More complex rotation patterns are required if the vehicle has a full-size spare tire that is part of the rotation, or if there are snow tires.|$|E

40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} {{for determining the}} caliper and/or the ultrasonic transit time through the thickness direction of a moving web of material using ultrasonic pulses generated by a rotatable wheel ultrasound apparatus. The apparatus includes a first liquid-filled tire and either a second liquid-filled tire forming a nip or a rotatable cylinder that supports a thin moving web of material such as a moving web of paper and forms a nip with the first liquid-filled tire. The components of ultrasonic transit time through the tires and fluid held within the tires may be resolved and separately employed to determine the separate contributions of the two tire thicknesses and the two fluid paths to the total path length that lies between two ultrasonic transducer surfaces contained within the tires in support of caliper measurements. The present invention provides the benefit of obtaining a transit time and caliper measurement {{at any point in}} time as a specimen passes through the nip of rotating tires and eliminates inaccuracies arising from nonuniform tire circumferential thickness by accurately retaining point-to-point specimen transit time and caliper variation information, rather than an average obtained through one or more <b>tire</b> <b>rotations.</b> Morever, ultrasonic transit time through the thickness direction of a moving web may be determined independent of small variations in the wheel axle spacing, tire thickness, and liquid and tire temperatures.

50|$|In (automotive) vehicle dynamics, slip is the {{relative}} motion between a tire {{and the road}} surface it is moving on. This slip can be generated either by the tire's rotational speed being greater or less than the free-rolling speed (usually described as percent slip), or by the <b>tire's</b> plane of <b>rotation</b> being {{at an angle to}} its direction of motion (referred to as slip angle).|$|R
50|$|Tires may exhibit {{irregular}} {{wear patterns}} once installed on a vehicle and partially worn. Front-wheel drive vehicles tend {{to wear the}} front tires at a greater rate compared to the rear tires. <b>Tire</b> <b>rotation</b> is moving the tires to different car positions, such as front-to-rear, in order to even out the wear, {{with the objective of}} extending the life of the tire.|$|E
50|$|The {{weight on}} the front and rear axles differs which causes uneven wear. With the {{majority}} of cars having the engine in front, the front tires typically bear more weight than the rear tires. Front-wheel drive vehicles have not only the engine but also the transaxle in front, adding to the weight differential. Moreover, additional stress is placed disproportionately on the front tires by braking and steering. Thus, <b>tire</b> <b>rotation</b> needs to occur more frequently for front-wheel drive vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Tires {{may also}} be directional, where the tread pattern favors {{operation}} in one direction. This usually {{takes the form of}} v-shaped grooves that help to disperse water from the center {{to the edge of the}} tread. Symmetric directional tires can be used on both sides, but once mounted on a rim cannot be moved to the other side, since the tread pattern will be in the wrong direction. This restricts <b>tire</b> <b>rotation.</b> Some directional tires are also asymmetric, in which case there will be specific left and right-handed versions.|$|E
50|$|Overall {{drivetrain}} reduction {{comes down}} to three basic factors: transmission gearing (including overdrive), differential gearing (in the axle), and <b>tire</b> size. The <b>rotation</b> speed problem comes into effect when the differential gearing is a high ratio and an overdrive is used to compensate. This may create unpleasant vibrations at high speeds and possible destruction of the driveshaft due to the centripetal forces or uneven balance.|$|R

5000|$|Transfer {{cases that}} are {{designed}} to allow for normal road use synchronize the difference between the rotation of the front and rear wheels, {{in much the same way}} the differential acts on a given axle. This is necessary because the front and rear tires never turn at the same speed. Different rates of <b>tire</b> <b>rotation</b> are generally due to different tire diameters (since front and rear tires inevitably wear at different rates) and different gear ratios in the front and rear differentials since manufacturers will often have a slightly lower ratio in the front vs. the rear to help with control (such as a 3.55:1 in the rear differential and a 3.54:1 in the front differential). If the transfer case did not make up the difference between the two different rates of rotation, binding would occur and the transfer case could become damaged. This is also why a transfer case that is not designed for on-road use must never be driven on dry pavement.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, {{freshman}} fraternity pledges {{were often}} forced to ride tricycles around campus.

The race is divided into men's and women's divisions. Men must complete 15 laps around Peters Parking Deck while women must complete 10. In times of poor weather, the race can be shortened. The teams are made up of assorted fraternities, sororities, ROTC, sports clubs, and other student organizations. The teams can have up to seven members (4 drivers and 3 pit crew). As the tricyclers race, they must complete three pit stops in which the front tire is rotated. Each <b>tire</b> <b>rotation</b> and each lap is counted by a designated Ramblin' Reck Club member. The tricycles are provided by Ramblin' Reck Club but because they are made for children, an additional support bar can be welded to the frame. The toy tricycles require unique techniques and strategies for effective riding.|$|E
30|$|These motions are {{of little}} {{consequence}} for road traffic traveling on pneumatic <b>tires,</b> because the <b>rotations</b> {{of the transition}} span are small (less than 3 °). However, they pose problems for a fixed rail system, which cannot undergo, without yielding, a concentrated rotation at the pivot points. Even if a pin could be introduced, the resulting concentrated rotation would cause impacts that would prove unacceptable to the riders in terms of comfort and safety [2, 3], and would risk causing damage to the mechanism. It was therefore necessary to develop a system that would spread the rotations over a sufficiently long length of rail that the resulting curvature induced stresses would be acceptably small, but that would {{at the same time}} provide vertical support for the track at every tie.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{simplified}} {{model of a}} rotating tire is developed and free vibrations of the tire are analysed on an example case. The tire belt is modelled as a rotating cylindrical shell. The shell ends {{are assumed to be}} with free boundary conditions. A flexible foundation is considered under the belt surface in order {{to take into account the}} stiffness of the air inside the tire as well as the tire sidewall. Moreover, the tire inflation pressure is accounted for. This is necessary since it generates an important tangential pre-stress in the tire belt. Finally, the effects of rotation onto the resonance frequencies and the mode shapes of the tire are considered. This is done by introducing Coriolis and centrifugal terms into the equations of motion plus the tangential centrifugal pre-stress. The boundary conditions of the elastically supported shell are satisfied exactly and the corresponding mode shapes and the resonance frequencies are calculated for an example case. Unlike the shells with simply supported ends, the shells with free ends have the functional form of the mode shapes changing with frequency. In particular, the dependence of a mode shape on the axial coordinate exhibits strong generic variation with frequency. Consequently, different combinations of transcendental functions (hyperbolic and circular) occur at different frequency ranges. The Coriolis accelerations and the centrifugal tension are shown to play an important role in how the resonance frequencies of the <b>tire</b> veer with <b>rotation</b> speed. In fact, the modes rotating backward and forward along the tire circumference tend to slow down or speed up with the increase in rotation speed. Thus they no longer superimpose into standing waves. In contrast, they keep propagating as travelling modes. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic fields {{emanate from}} radial tires {{due to the}} {{presence}} of reinforcing belts which are made of magnetized steel wire. When these tires spin, they generate alternating magnetic fields of extremely low frequency (ELF), usually below 20 Hz. The fundamental frequency of these fields is determined by <b>tire</b> <b>rotation</b> rate and has a sinusoidal waveform with a high harmonic content. The static field of radial tires can exceed 500 mT at the tread, and the tire-generated alternating fields can exceed 2. 0 mT at seat level in the passenger compartment of vehicles. Degaussing the tires reduces both the static and alternating fields to low levels, but the fields increase gradually over time after degaussing. The tire-generated fields are below the frequencies detected by most of the magnetic field meters used in previous studies of power frequency magnetic field health effects. If these fields are biologically active, failure to detect them could compromise exposure assessments associated with epidemiologic studies.

40|$|An {{integrated}} model is under development {{which will be}} able to predict the interior noise due to the vibrations of a rolling tire structurally transmitted to the hub of a vehicle. Here, the tire belt model used as part of this prediction method is first briefly presented and discussed, and it is then compared to other models available in the literature. This component will be linked to the tread blocks through normal and tangential forces and to the sidewalls through impedance boundary conditions. The tire belt is modeled as an orthotropic cylindrical ring of negligible thickness with rotational effects, internal pressure, and prestresses included. The associated equations of motion are derived by a variational approach and are investigated for both unforced and forced motions. The model supports extensional and bending waves, which are believed to be the important features to correctly predict the hub forces in the midfrequency (50 – 500 Hz) range of interest. The predicted waves and forced responses of a benchmark structure are compared to the predictions of several alternative analytical models: two three dimensional models that can support multiple isotropic layers, one of these models include curvature and the other one is flat; a one-dimensional beam model which does not consider axial variations; and several shell models. Finally, the effects of internal pressure, prestress, curvature, and <b>tire</b> <b>rotation</b> on free waves are discussed. <br/...|$|E
40|$|This study characterizes {{extremely}} low frequency (ELF) magnetic field (MF) levels in 10 car models. Extensive measurements were conducted in three diesel, four gasoline, and three hybrid cars, under similar controlled conditions and negligible background fields. Averaged over all four seats under various driving scenarios the fields were lowest in diesel cars (0. 02 μT), higher for gasoline (0. 04 – 0. 05 μT) and highest in hybrids (0. 06 – 0. 09 μT), but all were in-line with daily exposures from other sources. Hybrid cars had the highest mean and 95 th percentile MF levels, and an especially large percentage of measurements above 0. 2 μT. These parameters were also higher for moving conditions compared to standing while idling or revving at 2500 RPM and higher still at 80 km/h compared to 40 km/h. Fields in non-hybrid cars were higher at the front seats, while in hybrid cars they were higher at the back seats, particularly the back right seat where 16 %– 69 % of measurements were greater than 0. 2 μT. As our results do not include low frequency fields (below 30 Hz) that might be generated by <b>tire</b> <b>rotation,</b> we suggest that net currents flowing through the cars’ metallic chassis may be a possible source of MF. Larger surveys in standardized and well-described settings should be conducted with different types of vehicles and with spectral analysis of fields including lower frequencies due to magnetization of tires...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} vehicle {{parameter identification}} algorithms, and applies identified parameters to a controller designed for safe path following. A tire-road friction coefficient is estimated using an in-tire accelerometer to measure acceleration signals {{directly from the}} tires. The proposed algorithm first determines a tire-road contact patch with a radial acceleration profile. The estimation algorithm is based on tire lateral deflections obtained from lateral acceleration measurements only inside the contact patch. A new model is derived for the lateral deflection profiles, which provides robustness to orientation-variation of the accelerometer body frame during <b>tire</b> <b>rotation.</b> A novel algorithm is developed to identify three inertial parameters: sprung mass, yaw moment of inertia, and longitudinal position {{of the center of}} gravity. A correlation of inertial parameters is derived and is used for the identification algorithm. Inertial parameters and vehicle states are simultaneously estimated with a dual unscented Kalman filter based on a nonlinear vehicle model. In order to activate and de-activate different modes of the proposedalgorithm, a local observability analysis is performed with the nonlinear vehicle model. The performance and robustness of the proposed approach are demonstrated with extensive CarSim simulations and experimental tests on a flat road with a constant tire-road friction coefficient. Following a curved road can be dangerous if autonomous vehicles do not take roll motion into consideration. A control algorithm is designed to prevent a dangerous vehicle state induced by roll motion while following a curved road. Roll motion is suppressed throughout cornering with model predictive control. A four-wheel nonlinear vehicle model with roll dynamics and a tire brush model are utilized for the prediction of the vehicle state. An optimal balance in the trade-off between vehicle speed androll motion is achieved with full braking as a control actuator. Identified vehicle inertial parameters are incorporated into the designed controller. CarSim simulations illustrate the performance of the proposed controller and the effect of the vehicle parameter estimator...|$|E
