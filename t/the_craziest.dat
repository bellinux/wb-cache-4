500|$|Moreno González {{required}} his men {{to carry}} a [...] "spiritual manual" [...] that he wrote himself, [...] " [...] pseudo-Christian aphorisms for self-improvement." [...] In his [...] "bible," [...] Moreno González prohibited his men from consuming alcoholic beverages or other drugs, and stated that he would severely punish those who mistreated women. His writings encouraged the corporal punishment of thieves by beating them and making them walk naked with billboards in the city streets. He prohibited members of his cartel from consuming or selling methamphetamines in Michoacán, arguing that the drug was only to be smuggled into the U.S. for American consumers. Moreno González justified drug trafficking by stating that La Familia Michoacana allegedly regulated the drug trade to prevent exploitation of the people. The book, sometimes known as [...] "The Sayings of <b>the</b> <b>Craziest</b> One", also talks about humility, service, wisdom, brotherhood, courage, and God. His second book, titled [...] "They Call Me <b>The</b> <b>Craziest</b> One", is 13 chapters long and talks about his life, idealism, the origins of La Familia Michoacana, their battle against Los Zetas, and his rationale behind joining organized crime. The text reads like a diary and justifies his criminal activities under the rationale that just like others in Michoacán, the limited opportunities and his poor financial situation pushed him {{to get involved in}} the drug trade. In addition to that, Moreno González blamed the government for the existence of criminals.|$|E

500|$|Punk {{rock bands}} often emulate the bare musical {{structures}} and arrangements of 1960s garage rock. Typical punk rock instrumentation includes {{one or two}} electric guitars, an electric bass, and a drum kit, along with vocals. Songs tend to be shorter than those of other popular genres. Punk songs were played at fast, [...] "breakneck" [...] tempos, an approach influenced by The Ramones. Most early punk rock songs retained a traditional rock 'n' roll verse-chorus form and 4/4 time signature. However, later bands have often broken from this format. In critic Steven Blush's description, [...] "The Sex Pistols were still rock'n'roll ... like <b>the</b> <b>craziest</b> version of Chuck Berry. Hardcore was {{a radical departure from}} that. It wasn't verse-chorus rock. It dispelled any notion of what songwriting is supposed to be. It's its own form." ...|$|E

However, they decided that having an animal character die felt less morbid and more appropriate for the finale of a comedy series. The episode ends with Tom and Jean-Ralphio in their new Entertainment 720 headquarters, a completely white [...] room with modern decor and unusual furniture. Schur described the setting as [...] "maybe <b>the</b> <b>craziest</b> thing that's ever been on our series. ...

500|$|The group's {{solution}} was to fly {{back and forth between}} Dublin and their concert destinations for about ten days to finish recording and mixing at night and during their off-days. Clayton called the process [...] "about <b>the</b> <b>craziest</b> thing you could do to yourself", while Mullen said of it, [...] "It was mad, but it was mad good, as opposed to mad bad." [...] McGuinness later said the band had nearly wrecked themselves in the process. The group simultaneously used three separate rooms at Windmill Lane to mix, overdub, and edit. Adams said the hectic approach meant [...] "there was never anybody sitting around waiting or doing nothing". Flood called the period one of [...] "absolute lunacy". Eschewing console automation, the engineers adopted a [...] "live performance" [...] attitude to mixing, based on past experiences with Lanois. The band and production crew sat in on the mixing and offered encouragement, creating, as Adams put it, [...] "a kind of cheerleader thing.

[...] Robert John Young, Professor of Wildlife Conservation at the University of Salford, criticized Rio 2016 for failing to capitalize on environmental protection by [...] "inventing" [...] mascots, rather than using actual animal species.

500|$|However, {{the decade}} later {{featured}} {{a decline in}} output by neo soul artists, with many of them failing to make a commercial impact after previous successes or not releasing a follow-up album. Badu's commercial viability decreased as each of her releases following her debut Baduizm departed further from that album's music. Hill followed-up her 1998 debut, considered the best-selling neo soul album, with the 2002 live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, a combative, confessional work in which she expresses her misgivings about fame. Melena Ryzik of The New York Times wrote in a retrospect of that [...] "era of left-of-center black singer-songwriters", stating [...] "many of them struggled to keep their creative momentum, conflicted about their early mainstream success." [...] Producer and Soulquarians member Questlove elaborated on the artists' regression from the mainstream, saying [...] "I {{think most of us}} went through our psychosomatic, quasi-self-saboteur stage. Once we got that first taste of success, I think just the pressure of reacting got to all of us. Some of us released some of <b>the</b> <b>craziest</b> records of our career." [...] Other artists such as D'Angelo and Hill went on indefinite hiatus from the music scene.

And the fact that someone who did it was also from Britain, but this was being played out on a global scale... It seemed like <b>the</b> <b>craziest</b> thing I’d ever heard." [...] Other songs criticise political leaders in the United Kingdom. Higgs had been vocal of his distaste of politics in interviews following the release of Arc. Several critics suggest that [...] "The Wheel (Is Turning Now)" [...] is a commentary on the [...] "snake-oil appeal" [...] of then-UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage; Higgs told The Line of Best Fit that the song also comments on [...] "religious leaders and charismatic, corrupt leaders, or even men as gods". [...] "No Reptiles" [...] supposes that political leaders are [...] "just fat, bald, old men, like soft-boiled eggs, that are just weak-willed, with no strong feelings (good or ill)"; its lyrics also make cryptic reference to Elliot Rodger, who carried out the 2014 Isla Vista killings.|$|E

Michael Schur said the aerial shot of the harvest festival {{at the end of}} the episode was the most expensive shot in the entire series. The episode was filmed out of sequence from the rest of the season so the weather would be cooler when the scenes were shot; Schur jokingly said if this was not done, [...] "the week that we would have been shooting it was like 148 degrees here and the actors would be dead now". The Eagleton public forum scene in the episode [...] "Eagleton" [...] was shot at the Toluca Lake Sports Center in the Toluca Lake district of Los Angeles.

A number of songs from the album were incorporated into the subsequent [...] "Zooropa" [...] and [...] "Zoomerang" [...] legs, most frequently [...] "Numb" [...] and [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)".
