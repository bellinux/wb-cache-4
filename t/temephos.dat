50|$|<b>Temephos,</b> {{marketed as}} Abate and ProVect, is an {{organophosphate}} which prevents mosquito larvae from developing resistance to bacterial larvicides. Due {{to the small}} amount needed and the fast rate that <b>temephos</b> breaks down in water, this type of larvicide does not pose an unreasonable health risk to humans, but at large doses it can cause nausea or dizziness. Similarly, {{there is not a}} large risk to terrestrial species, but there is a toxic concern for non-targeted aquatic species. Therefore, <b>temephos</b> should be limited only to sites where less hazardous larvicides are ineffective and with intervals between applications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Temephos</b> in {{domestic}} water containers remains {{a mainstay of}} Latin American government programmes for control of Aedes aegypti and associated illnesses, including dengue. There is little published evidence about coverage of routine <b>temephos</b> programmes. A cluster randomised controlled trial of community mobilisation in Mexico and Nicaragua reduced vector indices, dengue infection, and clinical dengue cases. Secondary analysis from the Mexican arm of the trial examined <b>temephos</b> coverage and beliefs, {{and the impact of}} the trial on these outcomes. Methods The trial impact survey in December 2012, in 10, 491 households in 45 intervention and 45 control clusters, asked about visits from the <b>temephos</b> programme, retention of applied <b>temephos,</b> and views about <b>temephos</b> and mosquito control. Fieldworkers noted if <b>temephos</b> was present in water containers. Results Some 42. 4 % of rural and 20. 7 % of urban households reported no <b>temephos</b> programme visits within the last 12  months. Overall, 42. 0 % reported they had <b>temephos</b> placed in their water containers less than 3  months previously. Fieldworkers observed <b>temephos</b> in at least one container in 21. 1 % of households. Recent <b>temephos</b> application and observed <b>temephos</b> were both significantly more common in urban households, when other household variables were taken into account; in rural areas, smaller households {{were more likely to have}} <b>temephos</b> present. Most households (74. 4 %) did not think bathing with water containing <b>temephos</b> carried any health risk. Half (51 %) believed drinking or cooking with such water could be harmful and 17. 6 % were unsure. Significantly fewer households in intervention sites (16. 5 %) than in control sites (26. 0 %) (Risk Difference −  0. 095, 95 % confidence interval −  0. 182 to − 0. 009) had <b>temephos</b> observed in their water; more households in intervention clusters (41. 8 %) than in control clusters (31. 6 %) removed the applied <b>temephos</b> quickly. Although fewer households in intervention sites (82. 7 %) compared with control sites (86. 7 %) (RD - 0. 04, 95 % CI - 0. 067 to − 0. 013) agreed <b>temephos</b> and fumigation was the best way to avoid mosquitoes, the proportion believing this remained very high. Conclusion Coverage with the government <b>temephos</b> programme was low, especially in rural areas. Despite an intervention encouraging non-chemical mosquito control, most households continued to believe that chemicals are the best control method. Trial registration ISRCTN: 27581154...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A cluster-randomized {{controlled}} {{trial of}} community mobilisation for dengue prevention in Mexico and Nicaragua reported, as a secondary finding, {{a higher risk}} of dengue virus infection in households where inspectors found <b>temephos</b> in water containers. Data from control sites in the preceding pilot study and the Nicaragua trial arm provided six time points (2005, 2006, 2007 and 2011, 2012, 2013) to examine potentially protective effects of <b>temephos</b> on entomological indices under every day conditions of the national vector control programme. Methods Three household entomological indicators for Aedes aegypti breeding were Household Index, Households with pupae, and Pupae per Person. The primary exposure indicator at the six time points was <b>temephos</b> identified physically during the entomological inspection. A stricter criterion for exposure at four time points included households reporting <b>temephos</b> application during the last 30  days and <b>temephos</b> found on inspection. Using generalized linear mixed modelling with cluster as a random effect and <b>temephos</b> as a potential fixed effect, at each time point we examined possible determinants of lower entomological indicators. Results Between 2005 and 2013, <b>temephos</b> exposure was not significantly associated with a reduction in any of the three entomological indices, whether or not the exposure indicator included timing of <b>temephos</b> application. In six of 18 multivariate models at the six time points, <b>temephos</b> exposure was associated with higher entomological indices; in these models, we could exclude any protective effect of <b>temephos</b> with 95 % confidence. Conclusion Our failure to demonstrate a significant protective association between <b>temephos</b> and entomological indices might be explained by several factors. These include ecological adaptability of the vector, resistance of Aedes to the pesticide, operational deficiencies of vector control programme, or a decrease in preventive actions by households resulting from a false sense of protection fostered by the centralized government programme using chemical agents. Whatever the explanation, the implication is that <b>temephos</b> affords less protection under routine field conditions than expected from its efficacy under experimental conditions.

40|$|Background <b>Temephos</b> is an {{organophosphate}} pesticide used as larvicide in the environment. Although not extremely hazardous, it can {{be risky}} for human health in the moderate concentrations. Objectives This study investigated the quantitative removal efficiency of <b>temephos,</b> an organophosphate pesticide, from contaminated water by silver-modified ZVINPs. In addition, the operational parameters affected on removal process were optimized. Materials and Methods In the current study, three water samples {{from different parts of}} Iran such as Ahvaz tap water, the Karoon River passing through Khoramshahr city, and the Caspian Sea were collected. A new method for effective removal of <b>temephos</b> from the sample solutions by silver modified zero-valent iron nanoparticles as an efficient adsorbent was introduced. Results For a typical solution in which <b>temephos</b> was removed about 21 % by iron zero-valent nanoparticles, modification by silver improved removal method was up to about 99 %. The required time for the complete removal of <b>temephos</b> was about eight minutes. Variation of pH and concentration of KNO 3 as an electrolyte was considerably ineffective on the efficient <b>temephos</b> removal. Adsorption studies of the method were followed by Langmuir isotherm. Maximum <b>temephos</b> adsorption amount was 12. 65 mg/g under optimal conditions. The proposed method was simple, fast and safe to treat <b>temephos</b> polluted waters. Preparation of the adsorbent was easy and removal time was short.

40|$|The {{organophosphate}} <b>temephos</b> {{has been}} the main insecticide used against larvae of the dengue and yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) in Brazil since the mid- 1980 s.

The mortality results obtained were subjected to spatial analysis for distance interpolation using semi-variance models to generate maps that depict the spread of <b>temephos</b> resistance in Brazil since 1999. The problem has been expanding. Since 2002 - 2003, approximately half the country has exhibited mosquito populations resistant to <b>temephos.</b> The frequency of <b>temephos</b> resistance and, likely, control failures, which start when the insecticide mortality level drops below 80 %, has increased even further since 2004.

The duration of <b>temephos</b> residual effects in household-owned water-holding tanks (the most productive container type and main target for control) was estimated prospectively in two trials. <b>Temephos</b> was applied using spoons or inside perforated small zip-lock bags. Water samples from the study tanks (including positive and negative controls) were collected weekly and subjected to larval mortality bioassays.

The median duration of residual effects of <b>temephos</b> applied using spoons (2. 4 weeks) was significantly lower than with zip-lock bags (3. 4 weeks), and widely heterogeneous between tanks.

The {{chemical}} compound <b>temephos</b> (0, 0, 0 ’, 0 ’-tetrametyl- 0, 0 ’-thiodi-p-phenylene phosphorothioate) is an organophosphorous pesticide {{that has been}} used in Brazil since 1967 in control campaigns against the mosquito Aedes aegypti, the vector of dengue and yellow fever. We used single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE), SOS/umu and Ames/ Salmonella assays to test the toxicity and mutagenicity of <b>temephos.</b> <b>Temephos</b> was genotoxic in the SCGE assay, inducing severe DNA lesions (type IV lesions) at doses above 1. 34 µM.

40|$|In Brazil, {{decades of}} dengue vector control using {{organophosphates}} and pyrethroids {{have led to}} dissemination of resistance. Although these insecticides have been employed for decades against Aedes aegypti in the country, knowledge {{of the impact of}} <b>temephos</b> resistance on vector viability is limited. We evaluated several fitness parameters in two Brazilian Ae. aegypti populations, both classified as deltamethrin resistant but with distinct resistant ratios (RR) for <b>temephos.</b> The insecticide-susceptible Rockefeller strain was used as an experimental control. The population presenting the higher <b>temephos</b> resistance level, Aparecida de Goiânia, state of Goiás (RR 95 of 19. 2), exhibited deficiency in the following four parameters: blood meal acceptance, amount of ingested blood, number of eggs and frequency of inseminated females.

40|$|Background : Anopheles stephensi is a sub-tropical {{species and}} has been {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most important vector of human malaria throughout the Middle East and South Asian region including the malarious areas of southern Iran. Current reports confirmed An. stephensi resistance to <b>temephos</b> in Oman and India. However, there is no comprehensive research on mechanisms of <b>temephos</b> resistance in An. stephensi in the literature. This study was designed in order to clarify the enzymatic and molecular mechanisms of <b>temephos</b> resistance in this species. Methods : Profile activities of α- and ß-esterases, mixed function oxidase (MFO), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), insensitive acetylcholinesterase, and para-nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA) -esterase enzymes were tested for An. stephensi strain with resistance ratio of 15. 82 to <b>temephos</b> in comparison with susceptible strain. Results : Results showed that the mean activity of α-EST, GST and AChE enzymes were classified as altered indicating metabolic mechanisms have considerable role in resistance of An. stephensi to <b>temephos.</b> Molecular study using PCR-RFLP method to trace the G 119 S mutation in ACE- 1 gene showed lack of the mutation responsible for organophosphate insecticide resistance in the temephos-selected strain of An. stephensi. Conclusion : This study showed that the altered enzymes but not targets site insensitivity of ACE- 1 are responsible for <b>temephos</b> resistance in An. stephensi in south of Iran...|$|E
40|$|The {{mosquito}} Aedes aegypti is {{the principal}} vector of dengue and yellow fever flaviviruses. <b>Temephos</b> is an organophosphate insecticide used globally to suppress Ae. aegypti larval populations but resistance has evolved in many locations. Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) controlling <b>temephos</b> survival in Ae. aegypti larvae were mapped {{in a pair of}} F 3 advanced intercross lines arising from <b>temephos</b> resistant parents from Solidaridad, México and <b>temephos</b> susceptible parents from Iquitos, Peru. Two sets of 200 F 3 larvae were exposed to a discriminating dose of <b>temephos</b> and then dead larvae were collected and preserved for DNA isolation every two hours up to 16 hours. Larvae surviving longer than 16 hours were considered resistant. For QTL mapping, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified at 23 single copy genes and 26 microsatellite loci of known physical positions in the Ae. aegypti genome. In both reciprocal crosses, Multiple Interval Mapping identified eleven QTL associated with time until death. In the Solidaridad×Iquitos (SLD×Iq) cross twelve were associated with survival but in the reciprocal IqxSLD cross, only six QTL were survival associated. Polymorphisms at acetylcholine esterase (AchE) loci 1 and 2 were not associated with either resistance phenotype suggesting that target site insensitivity is not an organophosphate resistance mechanism in this region of México. <b>Temephos</b> resistance is under the control of many metabolic genes of small effect and dispersed throughout the Ae. aegypti genome...|$|E
40|$|Investigation on {{the current}} {{response}} of An. stephensi larvae to four WHO recommended larvicides, i. e. Malathion, <b>temephos,</b> chlorpyrifos and fenitrothion, were {{carried out in the}} laboratory in 1999. Diagnostic concentrations of pesticides only yielded 100 % mortality with malathion. In contrast, levels of susceptibility to temphos, chlorpyrifos (0. 025 mg/l) and <b>temephos</b> (0. 625 mg/l) killed 72 %, 90 % and 87 % of the population of An. Stephensi, respectively. At the LC 50 level the efficacies of chlorpyrifos and fenitrothion was higher than malathion and <b>temephos.</b> Relative toxicity of chlorpyrifos and fenitrothion was 6 and 24 times more than <b>temephos</b> and Malathion. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} the diagnostic dose of organophosphate larvicides depends on time, location, strain and genetically background of resistance to insecticides; hence they can be attributed to all species of anopheles...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory-bred {{females of}} Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus from the insectarium, Unit of Medical Entomology, Institute for Medical Research {{were used in}} the experiment. The late third stage of the F 0 larvae which survived the high {{selection}} pressure of malathion, permethrin and <b>temephos</b> were reared and colonies were established from adults that emerged. Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae were subjected to selection by malathion and permethrin for 40 generations, Ae. aegypti larvae to malathion, permethrin and <b>temephos</b> for 32 generations and Ae. albopictus larvae were selected against malathion and permethrin for 32 generations and 20 generations against <b>temephos.</b> The rate of resistance development was measured by LC 50 value. Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae developed higher resistance to malathion and permethrin compared to Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. On the whole, permethrin resistance developed at a faster rate than malathion and <b>temephos.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} {{status of}} field-collected Aedes aegypti (L.) from a dengue endemic area to Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) and <b>temephos</b> was determined. Since August 2007, biweekly ovitrap surveillance (OS) was conducted for 12 mo in 2 sites, A & B, in Shah Alam, Selangor. Site A {{was treated with}} a Bti formulation, VectoBacÂ® WG at 500 g/ha, from December 2007 - June 2008 while Site B was subjected to routine dengue vector control activities conducted by the local municipality. Aedes aegypti larvae collected from OS in both sites were bred until F 3 and evaluated for their susceptibility. The larvae were pooled according to 3 time periods, which corresponded to Bti treatment phases in site A: August - November 2007 (Bti pre-treatment phase); December 2007 - June 2008 (Bti treatment phase); and July - September 2008 (Bti post-treatment phase). Larvae were bioassayed against Bti or <b>temephos</b> in accordance with WHO standard methods. Larvae collected from Site A was resistant to <b>temephos,</b> while incipient <b>temephos</b> resistant was detected in Site B throughout the study using WHO diagnostic dosage of 0. 02 mg/L. The LC 50 of <b>temephos</b> ranged between 0. 007040 - 0. 03799 mg/L throughout the year in both sites. Resistance ratios (LC 50) indicated that <b>temephos</b> resistance increased with time, from 1. 2 - 6. 7 folds. The LC 50 of Ae. aegypti larvae to Bti ranged between 0. 08890 - 0. 1814 mg/L throughout the year in both sites, showing uniform susceptibility of field larvae to Bti, in spite of Site A receiving 18 Bti treatments {{over a period of}} 7 mo. No cross-resistance of Ae. aegypti larvae from <b>temephos</b> to Bti was detected...|$|E
40|$|Background Control and {{prevention}} of dengue relies heavily on the application of insecticides to control dengue vector mosquitoes. In Colombia, application of the larvicide <b>temephos</b> to the aquatic breeding sites of Aedes aegypti is {{a key part of}} the dengue control strategy. Resistance to <b>temephos</b> was recently detected in the dengue-endemic city of Cucuta, leading to questions about its efficacy as a control tool. Here, we characterize the underlying mechanisms and estimate the operational impact of this resistance.

40|$|The role of ATP-binding {{cassette}} (ABC) transporters in the efflux of the insecticide, <b>temephos,</b> {{was assessed}} in the larvae of Aedes aegypti. Bioassays were conducted using mosquito populations that were either susceptible or resistant to <b>temephos</b> {{by exposure to}} insecticide alone or in combination with sublethal doses of the ABC transporter inhibitor, verapamil (30, 35 and 40 &# 956;M). The best result in the series was obtained {{with the addition of}} verapamil (40 &# 956;M), which led to a 2 x increase in the toxicity of <b>temephos,</b> suggesting that ABC transporters may be partially involved in conferring resistance to the populations evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>temephos</b> as larvicides in disease {{prevention}} Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) in Indonesia {{has been going}} on for 40 years. Larviciding very long led the resistance to <b>temephos.</b> Cloves, one of native Indonesia plant contains eugenol that are toxic to the insect’s body. The aimed of this study to examine the effectiveness of Zanzibar clove leaf essential oil compared to <b>temephos</b> in killing the larvae of Aedes aegypti. This study used experimental laboratory research design. The samples are larvae of Aedes aegypti stage III. The mosquito larvae were classified into six groups, each given a clove leaf essential oil with different concentrations. Next will be observed the number of larvae that die after 24 hours. Based on statistical test p-value p < 0. 05 it indicates there are differences in the average mortality in the test group, and post hoc analysis showed the test group with 100 ppm of essential oil is not a significant difference with <b>temephos.</b> This study suggests the essential oil of clove leaf varieties of Zanzibar has the same effectiveness with <b>temephos</b> in killing the larvae of Aedes aegypti...|$|E
