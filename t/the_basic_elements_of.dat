5|$|Modern {{research}} on the historical Jesus has not led to a unified picture of the historical figure, {{partly because of the}} variety of academic traditions represented by the scholars. Given the scarcity of historical sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> his life. The portraits of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospels.|$|E
5|$|Spacetimes are the arenas {{in which}} all {{physical}} events take place—an event is a point in spacetime specified by its time and place. <b>The</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> spacetime are events. In any given spacetime, an event is a unique position at a unique time. Because events are spacetime points, in classical relativistic physics, the location of an elementary (point-like) particle {{at a particular time}} can be written as (x, y, z, t). A spacetime is the union of all events {{in the same way that}} a line is the union of all of its points, formally organized into a manifold.|$|E
5|$|All spoken {{languages}} have phonemes of {{at least}} two different categories, vowels and consonants, that can be combined to form syllables. As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use stress, pitch, duration, and tone to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called suprasegmental. Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, Rotokas and Pirahã language with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like Taa may have as many as 141 phonemes. In sign languages, the equivalent to phonemes (formerly called cheremes) are defined by <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.|$|E

2500|$|As aural/oral {{learning}} is <b>the</b> most <b>basic</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> discrimination learning, generalization is <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> inference learning. Generalization consists aural/oral learning, verbal learning, symbolic reading, and writing. At the generalization level of learning, students may listen to sets of familiar and unfamiliar tonal or rhythmic patterns and {{determine whether the}} patterns are the same or different, ultimately reading familiar and unfamiliar patterns, as well.|$|R
25|$|In 1968, {{physicists}} Jim Peebles in the US and Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and collaborators in the USSR independently computed the non-equilibrium recombination {{history of}} hydrogen. <b>The</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the model are the following.|$|E
25|$|Stanley Porter {{argues that}} Mithraism took hold within the Roman Empire after its {{expansion}} and only reached Asia Minor via Roman {{soldiers in the}} latter part of the first century, after <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the gospels were in place, and hence could not have influenced their essential elements.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> melody are pitch, duration, rhythm, and tempo. The {{tones of}} a melody are usually drawn from pitch {{systems such as}} scales or modes. Melody may consist, to {{increasing}} degree, of the figure, motive, semi-phrase, antecedent and consequent phrase, and period or sentence. The period may be considered the complete melody, however some examples combine two periods, or use other combinations of constituents to create larger form melodies.|$|E

25|$|The Mask of Sanity: An Attempt to Clarify Some Issues About the So-Called Psychopathic Personality is a {{book written}} by American {{psychiatrist}} Hervey M. Cleckley, first published in 1941, describing Cleckley's clinical interviews with patients in a locked institution. The text {{is considered to be}} a seminal work and the most influential clinical description of psychopathy in the twentieth century. <b>The</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> psychopathy outlined by Cleckley are still relevant today.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} difficult for any scholar {{to construct a}} portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> his life. On the other hand, scholars such as N. T. Wright and Luke Timothy Johnson argue {{that the image of}} Jesus presented in the gospels is largely accurate, and that dissenting scholars are simply too cautious about what we can claim to know about the ancient era.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> art—the line, {{particle}} of color—like {{words could}} be treated autonomously, each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, if so chose the artist. The line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an calculable abstract value, {{in addition to}} the particles of color and the relation of both to the observer's emotion. The underlying theory behind Neo-Impressionsim, something Divisionists like the Metzinger would push to the extreme, would have a lasting affect on the works produced in the coming years by Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay and Gino Severini.|$|E

25|$|Monodisperse powders of {{colloidal}} silica, for example, {{may therefore}} be stabilized sufficiently {{to ensure a}} high degree of order in the colloidal crystal or polycrystalline colloidal solid which results from aggregation. The degree of order appears to be limited by the time and space allowed for longer-range correlations to be established. Such defective polycrystalline structures would appear to be <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> nanoscale materials science, and, therefore, provide the first step in developing a more rigorous understanding of the mechanisms involved in microstructural evolution in inorganic systems such as sintered ceramic nanomaterials.|$|E
25|$|Steve Jobs visited Xerox PARC in 1979. He {{was excited}} by the revolutionary mouse-driven GUI of the Xerox Alto and was keen to use these ideas back at Apple. By late 1979, Jobs {{successfully}} negotiated with Xerox for his Lisa team to receive two demonstrations of ongoing research projects at Xerox PARC; when the Apple team saw the demonstration of the Alto computer {{they were able to}} see in action <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> what constituted a workable GUI. A great deal of work was put into making the graphical interface into a mainstream commercial product by the Lisa team.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> hip-hop—boasting raps, rival posses, uptown throwdowns, and {{political}} commentary—were all present in Trinidadian music {{as long ago}} as the 1800s, though they did not reach the form of commercial recordings until the 1920s and 30s. Calypso like other forms of music continued to evolve through the 50s and 60s. When rocksteady and reggae bands looked to make their music a form of national and even international black resistance, they took calypso's example. Calypso itself, like Jamaican music, moved {{back and forth between the}} predominance of boasting and toasting songs packed with 'slackness' and sexual innuendo and a more topical, political, 'conscious' style.|$|E

The best {{of them is a}} 1291 khachkar with the maker’s name carved in the bottom left star, {{which is one of the}} most {{intricate}} examples in existence. The finely carved lacy ornaments are arranged in layers in which <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the composition — a cross on a shield-shaped rosette and eight-pointed Starr filling the corners of the middle-cross section—show clearly. The intricate openwork ornaments vary — a clear-cut geometrical pattern constitutes the background, and the accentuating elements form a complicated combination of a floral and geometrical ornament which never repeats itself.|$|E
25|$|After Mort Weisinger {{took over}} {{as editor of the}} Superboy comics in 1953, the mythology of Superman began growing, {{starting}} with the introduction of Superboy's pet Krypto the Superdog, the first survivor of Krypton in comics other than Kal-El himself. When Weisinger became editor of the entire Superman line in 1958, the Superman mythology began expanding even more rapidly. Producing over a hundred Superman stories a year, Weisinger aimed to introduce a new element to the character's mythology every six months. By this time, <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> Superman's origin were in place, and Weisinger capitalized on it. Weisinger and his writers gave Superman history and family and constructed a world for readers to explore.|$|E
25|$|Anxious to {{pay homage}} to Stalin, Albania's rulers {{implemented}} elements of the Stalinist economic system. In 1949 Albania adopted <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the Soviet fiscal system, under which state enterprises paid direct contributions to the treasury from their profits and kept only a share authorized for self-financed investments and other purposes. In 1951 the Albanian government launched its first five-year plan, which emphasized exploiting the country's oil, chromite, copper, nickel, asphalt, and coal resources; expanding electricity production and the power grid; increasing agricultural output; and improving transportation. The government began a program of rapid industrialization after the APL's Second Party Congress and a campaign of forced collectivization of farmland in 1955. At the time, private farms still produced about 87% of Albania's agricultural output, but by 1960 the same percentage came from collective or state farms.|$|E

25|$|The {{hallmarks}} of Cutler's work are surreal, bizarre juxtapositions and {{close attention to}} small details of existence, all described in seemingly naive language. In performance his delivery was frail, halting and minimally inflected. His writing sometimes edged into whimsy or the macabre. Many of his poems and songs are {{in the form of}} conversations delivered as a monologue. In these, one party is often Cutler as a child, a poetic voice which he adopted in order to bypass the intellect. Cutler describes the poverty of his early life and the neglect he experienced from his parents with great stoicism. He expresses acceptance of his lot and gratitude for <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> life, for nature, and for parental love, even though that love might bear the marks of strain. In these works the humour arises from the child's curiosity and the playful or self-serving lies the parent tells him in instructing him to do a chore or in order to stop the incessant questions.|$|E
25|$|For Shakespeare as {{he began}} to write, both traditions were alive; they were, moreover, {{filtered}} through the recent success of the University Wits on the London stage. By the late 16th century, the popularity of morality and academic plays waned as the English Renaissance took hold, and playwrights like Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe revolutionised theatre. Their plays blended the old morality drama with classical theory to produce a new secular form. The new drama combined the rhetorical complexity of the academic play with the bawdy energy of the moralities. However, it was more ambiguous and complex in its meanings, and less concerned with simple allegory. Inspired by this new style, Shakespeare continued these artistic strategies, creating plays that not only resonated on an emotional level with audiences but also explored and debated <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> {{what it means to be}} human. What Marlowe and Kyd did for tragedy, John Lyly and George Peele, among others, did for comedy: they offered models of witty dialogue, romantic action, and exotic, often pastoral location that formed the basis of Shakespeare's comedic mode throughout his career.|$|E
25|$|The second main {{period during}} which the sources are silent extends for the half century after 1556 when the then Franciscan provincial, fray Francisco de Bustamante, {{publicly}} rebuked Archbishop Montúfar for promoting the Guadalupe cult. In this period, three Franciscan friars (among others) were writing histories of New Spain and of the peoples (and their cultures) who either submitted to or were defeated by the Spanish Conquistadores. A fourth Franciscan friar, Toribio de Benevente (known as Motolinía), who had completed his history as early as 1541, falls outside this period, but his work was primarily in the Tlaxcala-Puebla area. One explanation for the Franciscans' particular antagonism to the Marian cult at Tepeyac is that (as Torquemada asserts in his Monarquía indiana, Bk.X, cap.28) it was they who had initiated {{it in the first}} place, before realising the risks involved. In due course this attitude was gradually relaxed, but not until some time after a change in spiritual direction in New Spain attributed to a confluence of factors including (i) the passing away of the first Franciscan pioneers with their distinct brand of evangelical millennarianism compounded of the ideas of Joachim de Fiore and Desiderius Erasmus (the last to die were Motolinía in 1569 and Andrés de Olmos in 1571), (ii) the arrival of Jesuits in 1572 (founded by Ignatius Loyola and approved as a religious order in 1540), and (iii) the assertion of the supremacy of the bishops over the Franciscans and the other mendicant Orders by the Third Mexican Council of 1585, thus signalling the end of jurisdictional arguments dating from the arrival of Zumárraga in Mexico in December 1528. Other events largely impacting on society and the life of the Church in New Spain {{in the second half of}} the 16th century cannot be ignored in this context: depopulation of the Indians through excessive forced labour and the great epidemics of 1545, 1576–1579 and 1595, and the Council of Trent, summoned in response to the pressure for reform, which sat in twenty-five sessions between 1545 and 1563 and which reasserted <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the Catholic faith and confirmed the continuing validity of certain forms of popular religiosity (including the cult of the saints). Conflict over an evangelical style of Catholicism promoted by Desiderius Erasmus, which Zumárraga and the Franciscan pioneers favoured, was terminated by the Catholic Church's condemnation of Erasmus' works in the 1550s. The themes of Counter-reformation Catholicism were strenuously promoted by the Jesuits, who enthusiastically took up the cult of Guadalupe in Mexico.|$|E
