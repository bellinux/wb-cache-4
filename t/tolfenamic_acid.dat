Aberrant Wnt/β-catenin regulation pathway is a major mechanism of colon tumorigenesis. Here, we sought to better define the mechanism by which <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> suppresses colorectal tumorigenesis focusing on regulation of β-catenin pathway. Treatment of <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> led to a down-regulation of β-catenin expression in dose dependent manner in human colon cancer cell lines without changing mRNA.

40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease {{that is responsible for}} up to 80 % of all dementia cases. Hallmarks of AD include the presence of beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposits and twisted strands of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which ultimately lead to damage and death of nerve cells in the brain. Symptoms of the disease include impairments in cognitive and functional abilities that gradually worsen as the disease progress. Finally, in advanced AD, patients become unable to perform basic daily activities, become more susceptible to infections, and ultimately die. Only five drugs are FDA-approved for use in AD, which only provide temporary symptomatic relief without capabilities of modifying the progression of the disease. <b>Tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> is a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug that has the potential for slowing the progression of AD by inducing the degradation of the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp 1). Sp 1 regulates the expression of several AD-related genes including amyloid precursor protein (APP), tau and beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE 1). To investigate the ability of <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB), multiple approaches were utilized. In silico computational models to predict logBB and logPS for CNS penetration indicated that <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> could transfer passively through the BBB. In addition, immobilized artificial membrane (IAM) chromatography using a phosphatidylcholine column was utilized for the in vitro determination of the brain penetration capacity factor [(KIAM/MW 4) x 1010] of <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid.</b> The results showed that the [(KIAM/MW 4) x 1010] for <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> was 2. 73 indicating its ability to cross the BBB and penetrate into the brain. Upon intravenous (IV) administration of <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> to guinea pigs and mice, LC-MS analysis revealed the presence of <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> in the extracted brain tissue. This in vivo approach was also used to estimate the brain-to-plasma ratio (Kp) for <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid,</b> which was 0. 11. Thus, using in silico, in vitro and in vivo methods, we confirmed the ability of <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> to cross the BBB. The study offers a guide of using multiple approaches to predict the ability of different compounds to penetrate the brain. Next, we investigated the ability of <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> to attenuate the cognitive deficits in a transgenic mouse model of AD, namely R 1. 40. First, we demonstrated that hemizygous R 1. 40 mouse model exhibits spatial working and long-term memory deficits when tested in the Morris water maze and Y-maze. We found that short-term administration of <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> for 34 days was able to reverse the observed cognitive deficits in hemizygous R 1. 40 mice. These mnemonic improvements were parallel to reductions in SP 1 protein, APP expression and protein, and soluble and insoluble Aβ 40 - 42 levels. These findings suggest that the reductions in the biochemical markers of AD were also accompanied by functional improvements in the treated mice. We further examined the ability of <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> to improve spatial learning and memory as well as to reduce Aβ plaque pathology in old homozygous R 1. 40. Homozygous R 1. 40 mice exhibit cognitive deficits that are accompanied by fibrillar Aβ deposition in different regions of the brain by the age of 14 - 15 months. Our immunohistochemical results indicated that short-term <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment for 34 days was able to produce a drastic reduction in Aβ plaque pathology. In addition, spatial working memory, assessed by the spontaneous alternations in the Y-maze, was improved by <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment. Further, we investigated if <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> would improve the age-related learning and memory impairments in senescent C 57 BL/ 6 mice and we found that treatment with <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> for 34 days resulted in improvements in the spatial reference memory functions as well. The major findings from these studies suggest that <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> crosses the BBB into the brain, is able to decrease AD-related proteins including Aβ plaques, and is able to produce mnemonic functional improvements in AD transgenic mouse model and senescent wild type mice as well. Thus, <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> could be proposed as a disease-modifying therapy for AD via its unique mechanism...|$|E

Two types of pathological aggregates are found in AD. The senile plaques are composed of amyloid beta (Aβ), which is cleaved off the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE) and γ-secretase. The other deposits are the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are mainly composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. These aggregates and factors involved in the production or clearance of Aβ, as well as the phosphorylation of tau are being investigated for potential AD treatments but so far no successful drug candidate has been found. The transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp 1) has been linked to pathological intermediates in AD. Sp 1 regulates the transcription of APP, BACE 1, tau and its cyclin dependent kinase- 5 (CDK 5) activators p 39 and p 35. Previous experiments from our lab have shown that AD like pathology develops later in vitro and in vivo following early lead (Pb) exposure including elevated levels of SP 1, APP, Aβ, tau and CDK 5 as well as cognitive decline in mice. Studies from our lab demonstrated that decreasing Sp 1 protein (SP 1) levels following oral administration of <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> to mice was able to reduce APP and Aβ levels and improve cognition. In this dissertation, we first provided an introduction to AD with a review on the role of epigenetics in the disease and the various means by which transcriptional pathways can provide therapeutic alternatives for AD. We then examined the ability of <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> to affect the expression of AD targets that are regulated by Sp 1 including tau, phosphorylated tau, CDK 5 and BACE 1 in mice by using Western blot, real time PCR and enzyme activity assays. In addition, we studied the ability of <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> to prevent the increase in SP 1, APP and Aβ in differentiated neuroblastoma cells that was triggered by prior exposure to Pb. After treatment of cells with Pb, <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> or both, we used real time PCR, ELISA and Western blot analyses to examine the effects of both agents on AD related intermediates compared to control.

Previous experiments from our lab have shown that AD like pathology develops later in vitro and in vivo following early lead (Pb) exposure including elevated levels of SP 1, APP, Aβ, tau and CDK 5 as well as cognitive decline in mice. Studies from our lab demonstrated that decreasing Sp 1 protein (SP 1) levels following oral administration of <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> to mice was able to reduce APP and Aβ levels and improve cognition. In this dissertation, we first provided an introduction to AD with a review on the role of epigenetics in the disease and the various means by which transcriptional pathways can provide therapeutic alternatives for AD. We then examined the ability of <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> to affect the expression of AD targets that are regulated by Sp 1 including tau, phosphorylated tau, CDK 5 and BACE 1 in mice by using Western blot, real time PCR and enzyme activity assays. In addition, we studied the ability of <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> to prevent the increase in SP 1, APP and Aβ in differentiated neuroblastoma cells that was triggered by prior exposure to Pb. After treatment of cells with Pb, <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> or both, we used real time PCR, ELISA and Western blot analyses to examine the effects of both agents on AD related intermediates compared to control. In addition to providing a summary of the current knowledge on epigenetic therapeutic targets for AD, the major findings of this dissertation provide proof that <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> was able to decrease the transcription and translation of proteins involved in AD like tau, BACE 1 and CDK 5 as well as the phosphorylation of tau in mice. Moreover, in differentiated neuroblastoma cells, <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> decreased the expression of SP 1, APP gene and Aβ which was previously upregulated by Pb. Hence, <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> represents a novel oral drug candidate that can be beneficial for AD by affecting both the amyloid and tangle pathology of the disease through a unique transcription driven mechanis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Triptans are {{effective}} drugs for the acute treatment of migraine. However, 30 - 40 % {{of the patients}} commonly present recurrence before 24 hours therefore requiring another dose. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) such as <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> and naproxen sodium combined with sumatriptan have demonstrated efficacy in reducing recurrence observed with the single use of this drug. Steroids also have been suggested to treat refractory migraine and status migranosus. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether patients presenting frequent recurrence with the combination triptan plus NSAID, would decrease it with the association of dexamethasone. METHOD: Twenty three patients, 17 women and 6 men with migraine according to IHS criteria were prospectively studied. All patients presented frequent recurrence (> or = 60 %, mean recurrence rate 74, 8 %) with the single use of sumatritpan 100 mg or zolmitriptan 2, 5 mg or rizatriptan 10 mg in at least 5 consecutive attacks, and didn't present a reduction of the recurrence rate superior than 20 % with the combination of <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> 200 mg or rofecoxib 25 mg in at least 5 other consecutive attacks (mean recurrence rate 60 %). The patients had to treat 6 consecutive moderate or severe migraine attacks with their usual combination plus 4 mg of dexamathasone with a maximum of twice a week, and fill out a diary reporting headache parameters. RESULTS: Twenty patients, 16 women and 4 men completed the study. Of those who completed the study, 11 took rizatriptan plus rofecoxib, 4 rizatriptan plus <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid,</b> 3 zolmitriptan plus rofecoxib, 1 zolmitriptan plus <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> and 1 patient took sumatriptan plus <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid,</b> having the 20 patients taken as a third medication, a single tablet of 4 mg of dexamethasone. All patients took oral formulations and none presented vomiting after that. Among all 20 patients, one female and one male patient presented recurrence in 3 out of the 6 attacks (50 %) while the remaining 18 patients revealed recurrence in 1 or 2 treated attacks (mean 23, 4 %) (p< 0, 001). CONCLUSION: We concluded that the judicious use of oral dexamethasone might be useful for a limited population of migraine patients still presenting recurrence with the combination of a triptan and a NSAID. Case-control studies and studies with a randomized double-blind design are necessary to confirm these observations...|$|E
40|$|Optimization of {{formulation}} is {{the backbone}} of any robust formulation. <b>Tolfenamic</b> <b>Acid</b> is an orally and parenterally administered Non – steroidal anti-inflammatory drug belonging to the fenamate group. As per the British pharmacopoeia, uniformity of dispersion and fineness of dispersion is the basic requirement of Orodispersible tablets. Delay in dispersion times, variation in dispersion, poor wetting tendency of formulation {{is some of the}} measurable factors showing insufficient optimization in formulation of rapid dispersible tablets.   The size of granules {{plays a major role in}} disintegration and dispersion of rapid dispersible tablets. The present study was aimed to optimize the size of granules and selection of efficient disintegrants for rapid dispersible tablets of <b>Tolfenamic</b> <b>acid.</b> The present work studies effect of various size fractions of granules with superdisintegrants as Explotab, Ac di sol, Kyron T- 314, Kollidon CL to determine the influence of disintegrant type and optimization of dispersion.   <b>Tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> was co-micronized with microcrystalline cellulose and surfactants as sodium Lauryl sulfate. The formulation was than evaluated for various physical and analytical properties of rapid dispersible tablets. Results obtained showed that there was a significant increase in dissolution rate of drug with ac di sol and in first 5 minutes of time interval. The size of granules fraction also having a clear impact on dispersion and fineness of dispersion, the dispersion time was increasing with increasing the granules size fractions.  </p...|$|E
40|$|CLIBASIA_ 01510, PrbP, is a {{predicted}} RNA polymerase binding {{protein in}} Liberibacter asiaticus. PrbP {{was found to}} regulate expression of a small subset of ribosomal genes through interactions with the β-subunit of the RNA polymerase and a short, specific sequence on the promoter region. Molecular screening assays were performed to identify small molecules that interact with PrbP in vitro. Chemical hits were analyzed for therapeutic efficacy against L. asiaticus via an infected leaf assay, where the transcriptional activity of L. asiaticus was found to decrease significantly after exposure to <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid.</b> Similarly, <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> was found to inhibit L. asiaticus infection in highly symptomatic citrus seedlings. Our results indicate that PrbP is an important transcriptional regulator for survival of L. asiaticus in planta, and the chemicals identified by molecular screening assays {{could be used as}} a therapeutic treatment for huanglongbing disease...|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) distresses {{the lives}} of {{millions}} of people around the world. Its costs were estimated to be at least 100 billion dollars each year (Fillit, 2000). And so far, no cure has been found to stop or slow the progression of the disease. Senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are considered to be central in pathogenesis of AD. The plaques are mainly composed of aggregations of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides, which are generated upon the sequential cleavage of the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP) first by the enzyme β-secretase, and then by the enzyme γ-secretase. These plaques are one of the main targets being explored for newer therapeutic interventions in AD. The transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp 1) is associated with the pathology of AD, as it was found to be involved in the transcription of APP and the beta site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE 1) (Christensen et al., 2004, Basha et al., 2005, Santpere et al., 2006). <b>Tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> is an NSAID that was reported to lower Sp 1 levels (Abdelrahim et al., 2006). Accordingly, this study was designed to examine the capability of <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> to decrease the levels of the transcription factor Sp 1, and therefore, other AD involved proteins and peptides like APP and Aβ within animals 2 ̆ 7 brains. Consequently, the drug was administered to C 57 BL/ 6 mice and Hartley guinea pigs. Different doses of the drug were tried to find the dosage range where efficacy is achieved. Animals also were sacrificed at different time points, in order to study the drug effects over the time course of the study. Data showed that <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> was able to lower SP 1, APP and Aβ in the brains of animal models in a time dependent manner, and within certain doses. These studies demonstrate that <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> is a potential candidate for further development as a treatment for AD...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Postoperative pain is {{the major}} patient {{complaint}} after hemor-rhoidectomy, and adequate analgesia is imperative. Our purpose was to compare the analgesic properties and efficacy of transnasal butorphanol with meperidine. Methods. Forty patients who underwent hemorrhoidectomy {{were enrolled in the}} study from October 2006 to October 2007. They were divided ran-domly into two equal groups. Postoperatively, the butorphanol group re-ceived <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> (100 mg) every 6 h and butorphanol nasal spray (1 mg) at least every 4 h if in pain. The meperidine group received <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid</b> (100 mg) every 6 h and intramuscular meperidine (0. 8 mg/kg) at least every 4 h if in pain. Assessment of postoperative pain was made using a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 1 to 10. Medicinal adverse effects such as somnolence, dizziness, nausea and vomiting were recorded. Satisfac-tion with narcotic efficacy, desire to use this analgesia in the future, if re-quired, and complaints were recorded using questionnaires before dis...|$|E

40|$|Koh, JohnThe {{androgen}} receptor (AR) remains the leading target of advanced prostate cancer therapies. Thiosalicylamide analogs have previously {{been shown to}} act in cells as acyltransfer catalysts {{that are capable of}} transferring cellular acetate, presumably from Acetyl-CoA, to HIV NCP. Here we explore if the cellular acetyl-transfer activity of thiosalicylamides can be redirected to other cellular targets guided by ligands for AR. We constructed conjugates of thiosalicylamides and the AR-binding small molecule <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid,</b> which binds the BF 3 site of AR, proximal to the coactivator “FXXLF” binding surface. The thiosalicylamide-tolfenamic acid conjugate, YZ 03, but not the separate thiosalicylamide and <b>tolfenamic</b> <b>acid,</b> significantly enhanced acetylation of endogenous AR in CWR 22 cells. Further analysis confirms that Lys 720, a residue critical to FXXLF coactivator peptide binding, is a primary site of YZ 03 acetylation. Acyl-transfer conditions significantly enhance YZ 03 ’s ability to inhibit AR-coactivator association. These data suggest that biomimetic acyltransferases can enhance protein-protein interaction inhibitors through covalent modification of critical interfacial residues.
