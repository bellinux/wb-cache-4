2500|$|At least 20 U.S. {{states have}} experimented with Torrens title or other <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> systems {{at one time}} or another, but most have retreated to title {{recording}} under pressure from title insurers or from lack of interest. [...] According to Karl Llewellyn, one Torrens title on one lot in New York City can render the entire block unavailable for large-scale improvement (i.e., skyscrapers); no lender will finance the purchase of such a lot because no New York title insurer will guarantee a Torrens title. The U.S. title insurance industry has successfully opposed land registration systems by saying that they are vulnerable to fraud (a severe problem in most land registration jurisdictions) and that an inherently contingent property system more effectively protects property rights. While it is possible to fortify land registration systems to prevent the registration of forged deeds, the necessary countermeasures are complex and expensive.

40|$|This {{submission}} {{demonstrates the}} original contribution made by my published work in advancing {{knowledge and understanding}} {{in the field of}} land law and specifically the Torrens system of land registration (or more generally <b>title</b> by <b>registration).</b> My body of work references a series of integrated and interrelated research questions all of which go towards answering the following: To what extent have the judicial and legislative developments concerning <b>title</b> by <b>registration</b> achieved doctrinal coherence with the ideas that underlie a <b>title</b> by <b>registration</b> (or Torrens) system of land registration? Within this overarching question, the taxonomy of my work is structured as follows: doctrinal research into indefeasibility and the recognition of unregistered interests in the Torrens system, the relationship between possession and <b>title</b> by <b>registration,</b> and discourse on the application of economic theory and consumer law to <b>title</b> by <b>registration.</b> The overarching view I reach is that the Torrens system of land registration and the institutions that guard its principles (be it the Parliament, judiciary, academe,conveyancing agents, financial institutions, and electronic conveyancing regulators(Australian Registrars National Electronic Conveyancing Council and Property Exchange Australia)) must remain vigilant in ensuring that the Torrens system of land registration is not modified {{in such a way that}} its doctrinal coherence is undermined...|$|R

40|$|The Praedial Property Registration {{system has}} been {{presented}} as an alternative system to traditional registries for the formalization of immovable property. Much of the earlier design and pilot work for the Praedial Property Registration system {{was done by the}} Peruvian private organization, Instituto Libertad y Democracia (ILD). They claim that in Peru they "have formalized over 150, 000 properties much more quickly, and at dramatically less costs, than traditional <b>titling</b> and <b>registration</b> programs" in three-and-a-half years during the early 1990 s. This property formalization {{system has been}} trademarked as PROFORM. It is being offered to other countries as a quick and inexpensive way to convert informal property {{in the hands of a}} large proportion of the population into legally recognized private property, and as a source of capital for the grassroots development of these countries. This study assesses the functioning of this system in Peru and its replicability in other countries. There is no easily accessible documentation on how this property formalization program has actually functioned in Peru, and it is therefore difficult for development agencies to determine its applicability elsewhere. This assessment of the Registro Predial in Peru is an attempt to document the functioning of an important component of this formalization program. The study examines different aspects of property formalization and related institutions and processes. The scope of this assessment, therefore, includes not only the Registro Predial registration system, but also the titling process (prior to registration) and the credit worthiness and credit opportunities for titled and registered property in both urban and rural areas in Lima that fall under the jurisdiction of the Registro Predial. The study also examines the concepts and legal framework of <b>titling,</b> <b>registration,</b> ownership rights, and possession rights within the Peruvian context.
