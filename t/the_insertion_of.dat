5|$|Controversy rapidly {{surrounded}} Edward's death. With Mortimer's {{execution in}} 1330, rumours began to circulate that Edward {{had been murdered}} at Berkeley Castle.

It became incorporated into most later histories of Edward, typically being linked to his possible homosexuality. Most historians now dismiss this account of Edward's death, querying the logic in Edward's captors murdering him in such an easily detectable fashion.|$|E

5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension {{is a condition}} of unknown cause characterised by a rise in CSF pressure.

5|$|In a large PSP (>50%), or in a PSP {{associated}} with breathlessness, some guidelines recommend that reducing the size by aspiration is equally effective as <b>the</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> a chest tube. This involves {{the administration of}} local anesthetic and inserting a needle connected to a three-way tap; up to 2.5liters of air (in adults) are removed. If there has been significant reduction {{in the size of}} the pneumothorax on subsequent X-ray, the remainder of the treatment can be conservative. This approach has been shown to be effective in over 50% of cases. Compared to tube drainage, first-line aspiration in PSP reduces the number of people requiring hospital admission, without increasing the risk of complications.|$|E

5|$|Aetosaurs were herbivores, likely {{feeding on}} ferns and seed ferns that were {{common in the}} Triassic. The upturned shape of their snout {{suggests}} that aetosaurs may have dug up roots and tubers. Aetosaurs have several anatomical features {{that may have been}} adaptations to digging, including a short radius relative to the humerus (seen in many other digging tetrapods) and a large deltopectoral crest on the humerus that served as an attachment for muscles. Aetosaurs also have large hind feet, or pes, with large claws that were likely used for skratch-digging. One aetosaur, Typothorax, has an entepicondyle on the humerus, which is the origin of forearm pronator and manual flexor muscles often used in digging. Moreover, it has a large olecranon process on the ulna which projects backward past the elbow, giving a large area for <b>the</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> the triceps muscle. While many studies have suggested that aetosaurs had a fossorial or burrowing lifestyle, aetosaurs have few of the characteristics that fossorial animals have as adaptations to digging. Therefore, it is likely that aetosaurs were able to dig to some extent, possibly rooting for food, but were unable to burrow.|$|E

40|$|Clock tree {{synthesis}} {{plays an}} important role on the total performance of chip. Gated clock tree is an effective approach to reduce the dynamic power usage. In this paper, two novel gated clock tree synthesizers, power-aware clock tree synthesizer (PACTS) and power- and slew-aware clock tree synthesizer (PSACTS), are proposed with zero skew achieved based on Elmore RC model. In PACTS, the topology of the clock tree is constructed with simultaneous buffer/gate <b>insertion,</b> which reduces <b>the</b> switched capacitance. In PSACTS, a more practical clock slew constraint is applied. Compared to previous works, clock tree synthesis is done first and followed by <b>the</b> <b>insertions</b> <b>of</b> clock gates. <b>The</b> clock slew changes a lot after <b>the</b> <b>insertions</b> <b>of</b> clock gates in real cases. In our work, the clock tree is constructed simultaneously with <b>the</b> <b>insertions</b> <b>of</b> clock gates. This ensures the limitation of the clock slew can be strictly satisfied while the limitation of the clock slew is always applied in the real design. The experimental results show that the power cost of our work is smaller and the runtime is reduced. The slew rate constraint is satisfied with a small clock skew from SPICE estimation. Generally, our work has better performance, improved efficiency and is more practical to be applied in the industry. Department of Electronic and Information Engineerin...|$|R

5|$|Because his Nung {{soldiers}} were exhausted, with their ammunition and water supplies running low, White believed {{they could not}} defend the Ngok Tavak garrison in case the VC launched another major attack.

However, both White and Makowski knew that reinforcement was unlikely, because the two downed helicopters would prevent <b>the</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> additional soldiers, and the road between Ngok Tavak and Khâm Đức was likely to be covered by the opposing forces waiting in ambush positions. White then decided to evacuate Ngok Tavak and withdraw his troops to safety.

The Marines were ordered to fire their last remaining shells, about nine rounds in total, after their ammunition storage was set ablaze by the VC, and disable their 105mm guns.|$|E

5|$|Exclusion of {{judicial}} review has been attempted by the Parliament of Singapore to protect the exercise of executive power.

40|$|Objective:To {{determine}} the reference {{points for the}} exit of the tibial guidewire {{in relation to the}} posterior cortical bone of the tibia. Methods:Sixteen knees from fresh cadavers were used for this study. Using a viewing device and a guide marked out in millimeters, three guidewires were passed through the tibia at 0, 10 and 15 mm distally in relation to the posterior crest of the tibia. Dissections were performed and the region of the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tibial <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) was determined in each knee.
