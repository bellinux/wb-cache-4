5|$|Although {{the species}} was first named in 1904, it was {{included}} in Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) until molecular studies, first published in 2006, demonstrated that the two are distinct species. M.escalerai is most closely related to an unnamed species from Morocco. Unlike M.nattereri, which lives in small groups in tree holes, M.escalerai forms large colonies in caves. Females start <b>to</b> <b>aggregate</b> in late spring in maternity colonies, and their young are born in summer. The species spends each winter in hibernation colonies, usually in caves or basements.|$|E

5|$|After being omitted in {{the opening}} tour match against Worcestershire, Davidson made his debut on English soil against Leicestershire. He scored 63, {{featuring}} in a century partnership with Harvey, before taking 2/23 and 0/35 in an innings victory. In the next match against Yorkshire, he removed Len Hutton, regarded as the best batsman {{in the world at}} the time. In the nine first-class matches leading up to the Tests, Davidson performed steadily without being spectacular. He scored two fifties and passed 20 in every completed innings <b>to</b> <b>aggregate</b> 317 runs at 45.28, and took 17 wickets at 22.12, taking more than two wickets in an innings on only one occasion.

40|$|The {{endothelium}} release factor(s) {{that are}} potent vasodilators and inhibitors of platelet aggregation. Experiments {{were performed to}} determine whether the endothelium-dependent responses <b>to</b> <b>aggregating</b> platelets are altered in vein grafts. Segments of jugular veins were grafted in the reverse position into the carotid arteries in 16 rabbits. After 4 weeks the patent grafts (14 of 16) were removed, and the endothelium-dependent responses were examined in vitro. In control veins aggregating platelet, adenosine diphosphate, and serotonin caused endothelium-dependent relaxations. The platelet-induced relaxations were attenuated by apyrase (adenosine diphosphatase and adenosine triphosphatase) but not by methiothepin (serotonergic blocker). In vein grafts, endothelium-dependent relaxations in response <b>to</b> <b>aggregating</b> platelets were absent, and only contractions that could be attenuated by methiothepin were observed. In vein grafts, endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to adenosine diphosphate were reduced, and only endothelium-independent contractions were observed in response to serotonin. These contractions were attenuated by methiothepin. These results suggest that (1) the endothelium exerts an inhibitory effect mediated mainly by adenosine diphosphate in response <b>to</b> <b>aggregating</b> platelets in rabbit jugular veins and (2) endothelium-dependent relaxations in response <b>to</b> <b>aggregating</b> platelets are impaired in vein grafts because of reduced endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to adenosine diphosphate and augmented endothelium-independent contractions in response to serotonin. This impairment of endothelium-dependent responses in vein grafts may contribute to failure of the grafts. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|Cockroaches {{are social}} insects; {{a large number}} of species are either gregarious or {{inclined}} <b>to</b> <b>aggregate,</b> and a slightly smaller number exhibit parental care. It used to be thought that cockroaches aggregated because they were reacting to environmental cues, but it is now believed that pheromones are involved in these behaviors. Some species secrete these in their feces with gut microbial symbionts being involved, while others use glands located on their mandibles. Pheromones produced by the cuticle may enable cockroaches to distinguish between different populations of cockroach by odor. The behaviors involved have only been studied in a few species, but German cockroaches leave fecal trails with an odor gradient. Other cockroaches follow such trails to discover sources of food and water, and where other cockroaches are hiding. Thus, cockroaches have emergent behavior, in which group or swarm behavior emerges from a simple set of individual interactions.|$|E
5|$|In the tropics, a {{plentiful}} {{supply of}} phytoplankton is continuously available for starfish larvae to feed on. Spawning {{takes place at}} any time of year, each species having its own characteristic breeding season. In temperate regions, the spring and summer brings an increase in food supplies. The first individual of a species to spawn may release a pheromone that serves to attract other starfish <b>to</b> <b>aggregate</b> and to release their gametes synchronously. In other species, a male and female may come together and form a pair. This behaviour is called pseudocopulation and the male climbs on top, placing his arms between those of the female. When she releases eggs into the water, he is induced to spawn. Starfish may use environmental signals to coordinate the time of spawning (day length to indicate the correct time of the year, dawn or dusk to indicate the correct time of day), and chemical signals to indicate their readiness to breed. In some species, mature females produce chemicals to attract sperm in the sea water.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{success is}} {{dependent}} {{on a variety of}} factors that range from the plumage exhibited by a male to the composition of the lek itself. In one study, the female Guianan cocks-of-the-rock displayed sexual selection based off sequential comparisons or threshold standards. The hens engaged in a “pool–comparison” tactic, meaning that females chose males of higher rank in courtship. Males of higher rank were those with more matings received from other females; the lower-ranking single males were ignored. The rankings were determined by where the courts were positioned in the lek: courts that were more centrally placed indicated more successful and higher-ranking males. The females in the study were individually observed <b>to</b> <b>aggregate</b> towards larger, more centrally concentrated leks, demonstrating active female choice.|$|E

5|$|Other seals, {{like the}} walrus and most phocids, breed on ice with {{copulation}} usually {{taking place in}} the water (a few land-breeding species also mate in water). Females of these species tend <b>to</b> <b>aggregate</b> less. In addition, since ice is less stable than solid land, breeding sites change location each year, and males are unable to predict where females will stay during the breeding season. Hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, where females form dense aggregations perhaps due to their patchy food sources. Pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on pack ice. Some of these species are serially monogamous, including the harp seal, crabeater seal and hooded seal. Seals that breed on ice tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly longer than males. Walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Chapman entered Pembroke College, Cambridge. He {{failed in}} two trial games, {{organised}} {{prior to the}} 1920 cricket season to inform {{the selection of the}} Cambridge team, and despite his reputation, was omitted from the University's opening first-class match against Essex. But {{on the day of the}} match, a player withdrew from the Cambridge team and Chapman replaced him. Making his first-class debut on 15 May 1920, he scored 118 in a rapid innings and kept his place in the team for the remainder of the season. After a century and two fifties, he was selected for the University Match against Oxford. Chapman scored 27 in this final game of the university season <b>to</b> <b>aggregate</b> 613 runs at an average of 40.86, second in the Cambridge batting averages. Unusually for someone in their first year of University cricket, he was subsequently selected for the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. Although not particularly successful with the bat, critics singled him out for his effective fielding. During August, he played second-class Minor Counties cricket for Berkshire as an amateur and headed the team's batting averages; he later appeared in three end-of-season first-class games at the Scarborough Festival where he scored 101 in a Gentlemen and Players game against a bowling attack containing three internationals. In all first-class matches in 1920, Chapman scored 873 runs at 39.68.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{debate whether}} Smilodon was social. One study of African predators found that social predators like lions and spotted hyenas respond {{more to the}} {{distress}} calls of prey than solitary species. Since S.fatalis fossils are common at the La Brea Tar Pits, and were likely attracted by the distress calls of stuck prey, this could mean that this species was social as well. One critical study claims that the study neglects other factors, such as body mass (heavier animals {{are more likely to}} get stuck than lighter ones), intelligence (some social animals, like the American lion, may have avoided the tar because they were better able to recognize the hazard), lack of visual and olfactory lures, the type of audio lure, and the length of the distress calls (the actual distress calls of the trapped prey animals would have lasted longer than the calls used in the study). The author of that study ponders what predators would have responded if the recordings were played in India, where the otherwise solitary tigers are known <b>to</b> <b>aggregate</b> around a single carcass. The authors of the original study responded that though effects of the calls in the tar pits and the playback experiments would not be identical, this would not be enough to overturn their conclusions. In addition, they stated that weight and intelligence would not likely affect the results as lighter carnivores are far more numerous than heavy herbivores and the social (and seemingly intelligent) dire wolf is also found in the pits.|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} assay {{was used}} to measure the rate of collection of a population of embryonic neural retina cells to the surface of cell aggregates. The rate of collection of freshly trysinized cells was limited in the initial stages by the rate of replacement of trypsin-sensitive cell- surface components. When cells were preincubated, or "recovered," and then added <b>to</b> cell <b>aggregates,</b> collection occurred at a linear rate and was independent of protein and glycoprotein synthesis. The adhesion of recovered cells was temperature and energy dependent, and was reversibly inhibited by cytochalasin B. Colchicine had little effect on collection of recovered cells. Antiserum directed against recovered cell membranes was shown to bind to recovered cells by indirect immunofluorescence. The antiserum also was shown to inhibit collection of recovered cells <b>to</b> <b>aggregates,</b> suggesting {{that at least some of}} the antigens identified might be involved in the adhesion process. The inhibitory effect of the antiserum was dose dependent. Freshly trypsinized cells absorbed neither the immunofluorescence activity nor the adhesion-inhibiting activity. Recovered cells absorbed away both activities. In specificity studies, dorsal neural retina cells adhered <b>to</b> <b>aggregates</b> of ventral optic tectum in preference <b>to</b> <b>aggregates</b> of dorsal optic tectum.

40|$|Vasoconstrictor {{responses}} are augmented in porcine coronary arteries in hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis, {{leading to an}} occurrence of coronary vasospasm in the latter condition. The role of the endothelium in the vascular hyperreactivity in hypercholesterolemic and atherosclerotic coronary arteries was examined, particularly in response <b>to</b> <b>aggregating</b> platelets and related vasoactive substances. Male Yorkshire pigs underwent balloon endothelial denudation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and 2 % high-cholesterol feeding for 10 weeks. Electron microscopic examination demonstrated a full lining of endothelial cells in the LAD and the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX). Endothelium-dependent responses were examined in vitro. In cholesterol-fed animals, endothelium-dependent relaxations <b>to</b> <b>aggregating</b> platelets, serotonin, ADP, bradykinin, thrombin, and the calcium ionophore A 23187 were depressed in LAD (atherosclerosis), while the relaxations <b>to</b> <b>aggregating</b> platelets, serotonin and ADP were depressed in LCX (hypercholesterolemia). Serotonin-induced contractions were endothelium-dependently augmented in atherosclerotic LAD; the endothelium-dependent component of the contractions was inhibited by blockers of cyclooxygenase. Bioassay studies demonstrated a depressed release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) from the atherosclerotic LAD in response to serotonin. These experiments indicate that the endothelium-dependent relaxations <b>to</b> <b>aggregating</b> platelets and related vasoactive substances are severely impaired in atherosclerosis and moderately impaired in hypercholesterolemia. Since coronary atherosclerosis was induced {{by a combination of}} balloon endothelial injury (and regeneration) and high-cholesterol feeding in this study, the combined effects of those factors must account for the severely impaired responses in atherosclerosis. The depressed release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) and the concomitant release of vasoconstrictor product(s) of cyclooxygenase appear to be responsible for the impaired relaxations. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
