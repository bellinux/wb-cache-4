It is similar to a buddy line, which is used to tether two divers together during a dive.|$|E
5|$|Air {{conditioning}} â€“ Ambulances {{are often}} {{fitted with a}} separate air conditioning system to serve the working area from that which serves the cab. <b>This</b> <b>helps</b> to maintain an appropriate temperature for any patients being treated, but may also feature additional features such as filtering against airborne pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Amin {{recruited}} {{his followers}} {{from his own}} ethnic group, the Kakwas, along with South Sudanese. By 1977, these three groups formed 60 percent of the 22 top generals and 75 percent of the cabinet. Similarly, Muslims formed 80 percent and 87.5 percent of these groups {{even though they were}} only 5 percent of the population. <b>This</b> <b>helps</b> explain why Amin survived eight attempted coups.|$|E

5|$|Caddisfly {{cases are}} open at both ends, the larvae drawing oxygenated water through the {{posterior}} end, over their gills, and pumping {{it out of}} the wider, anterior end. The larvae move around inside the tubes and <b>this</b> <b>helps</b> maintain the water current; the lower the oxygen content of the water, the more active the larvae need to be. This mechanism enable caddisfly larvae to live in waters too low in oxygen content to support stonefly and mayfly larvae.|$|E
5|$|Carboxypeptidase cleaves peptide {{linkages}} during digestion of proteins. A coordinate {{covalent bond}} is formed between the terminal peptide and a C=O group attached to zinc, {{which gives the}} carbon a positive charge. <b>This</b> <b>helps</b> to create a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme near the zinc, which attracts the non-polar part of the protein being digested.|$|E

5|$|Moravec's paradox: Proving theorems {{and solving}} {{geometry}} problems is comparatively easy for computers, but a supposedly simple task like recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into anything is extremely difficult. <b>This</b> <b>helps</b> explain why research into vision and robotics had made so little progress {{by the middle}} 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{given that}} both {{population}} and prosperity increased substantially in this period, economic recovery in Byzantium {{appears to have}} been strengthening the economic basis of the state. <b>This</b> <b>helps</b> to explain how the Komnenian emperors, Manuel Komnenos in particular, were able to project their power and influence so widely at this time.|$|E
5|$|Retinoids are {{medications}} which reduce inflammation, normalize the {{follicle cell}} life cycle, and reduce sebum production. They are structurally related to vitamin A. The retinoids appear {{to influence the}} cell life cycle in the follicle lining. <b>This</b> <b>helps</b> prevent the accumulation of skin cells within the hair follicle that can create a blockage. They are a first-line acne treatment, especially for people with dark-colored skin, and are known to lead to faster improvement of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.|$|E

5|$|Stacking or rigging the subwoofers in a {{vertical}} array focuses the low frequencies {{forward to a}} greater or lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. <b>This</b> <b>helps</b> reduce the amount of low frequency sound bouncing off the ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} choose from five skills to {{overcome}} situations: Stealth, Athletics, Lore, Mechanics and Survival. As the player fights more creatures, more information is added to their bestiary. <b>This</b> <b>helps</b> the player collect information about how to attack them effectively. Early in the game, the protagonist will take over a stronghold, which acts as the party's fortress. This can be upgraded.|$|E
5|$|A study {{conducted}} by a United States child psychiatrist, Dr Kyle D. Pruett, found that infants between 7 and 30 months responded more favorably to being picked up by their fathers. Pruett also found that a father's parenting style is beneficial for a child's physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral development. Mothers reassure toddlers when they become frustrated while fathers encourage them to manage their frustration. <b>This</b> <b>helps</b> the children {{learn to deal with}} stress and frustration. A long-term study Pruett conducted proved that a father's active involvement with his children, from birth to adolescence, promotes greater emotional balance, stronger curiosity and a stronger sense of self-assurance in the child.|$|E

5|$|Agouti {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. <b>This</b> <b>helps</b> dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.|$|E
5|$|Also bird banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered {{metal or}} plastic tag to the leg or wing {{of a wild}} bird to enable individual identification. <b>This</b> <b>helps</b> in {{keeping track of the}} movements of the bird and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, it is common to take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the threat}} of imprisonment, Mysterion unmasks himself, showing the {{television}} viewers only the portion of his face that looks similar to almost all of Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class. The crowd, however, is shocked to learn Mysterion's identity and, much to the regret of all except Coon, who says that he knew who Mysterion was, even calling him out on it at one point (though <b>this</b> <b>helps</b> the audience little as Cartman claimed that practically everyone in his class was Mysterion at times), Mysterion is hauled to prison. With Professor Chaos, General Disarray and Mysterion defeated, Cartman now perceives {{that he is the}} superhero in South Park and that every town should have a Coon like him.|$|E

Students who qualify for studentâ€™s loan are {{able to use the}} Lebanese Identity Card to establish their identities to eliminate fraud. Data from the NIA database enables the Ministry of Education to plan effectively for the provision of targeted educational infrastructure and other resources for their community.|$|E
5|$|Fruit eating, or frugivory, {{is found}} in both major suborders. Bats prefer ripe fruit, pulling it off the trees with their teeth. They fly back to their roosts to eat the fruit, sucking out the juice and {{spitting}} the seeds and pulp out onto the ground. <b>This</b> <b>helps</b> disperse the seeds of these fruit trees, which may take root and grow where the bats have left them, and numerous species of plants depend on bats for seed dispersal. The Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) has been recorded carrying fruits weighing 3â€“14g (0.11â€“0.49oz) or even as much as 50g (1.8oz).|$|E
5|$|It is {{beneficial}} to give fluids, as <b>this</b> <b>helps</b> reduce dehydration. It {{is no longer}} recommended to administer aspirin, unless advised {{to do so by}} medical personnel, as analgesics may mask symptoms. People should be made comfortable and placed in the supine position (horizontal), or the recovery position if vomiting occurs. In the past, both the Trendelenburg position and the left lateral decubitus position (Durant's maneuver) have been suggested as beneficial where air emboli are suspected, but are no longer recommended for extended periods, owing to concerns regarding cerebral edema.|$|E
