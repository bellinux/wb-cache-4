40|$|The authors {{provide new}} {{evidence}} on the impacts of trade reforms on wages and wage inequality in developing countries. While most of the current literature on the topic achieves identification by comparing outcomes before and after one episode of trade liberalization across industries, they propose a stronger identifying strategy. The authors explore the recent historical record of policy changes adopted by Argentina: from significant protection in the early 1970 s, to the first episode of liberalization during the late 1970 s, back to a slowdown of reforms during the 1980 s, to the second episode of liberalization in the 1990 s. These swings in trade policy comprise broken trends in trade reforms that they can compare with observed trends in wages and wage inequality. After setting up unusual historical data sets of <b>trends</b> in <b>tariffs,</b> <b>trends</b> in wages, and trends in wage inequality, the evidence supports two well-known hypotheses: trade liberalization, other things being equal, (1) has reduced wages, and (2) has increased wage inequality.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the {{analysis}} of the evolution of software components. In order to track the evolution of software components, one needs to collect the evolution information of each component. This information is stored in the version control system (VCS) of the project�the repository of the history of events happening throughout the project�s lifetime. By using software archive mining techniques one can extract and leverage this information. The main contribution of this thesis is the introduction of <b>evolution</b> usage <b>trends</b> and <b>evolution</b> change patterns. The raw information about the occurrences of each component is stored in the VCS of the project. By organizing it in <b>evolution</b> <b>trends</b> and patterns, we are able to draw conclusions and issue recommendations concerning each individual component and the project as a whole. <b>Evolution</b> <b>Trends</b> An <b>evolution</b> <b>trend</b> is a way to track the evolution of a software component throughout the span of the project. The trend shows the increases and decreases in the usage of a specific component, which can be indicative of the quality of this component. AKTARI is a tool, presented in this thesis, that is based on such <b>evolution</b> <b>trends</b> and can be used by the software developers to observe and draw conclusions about the behavior of their project. Evolution Patterns An evolution pattern is a pattern of a frequently occurring code change throughout the span of the project. Those frequently occurring changes are project-specific and are explanatory of the way the project evolves. Each such evolution pattern contains in itself the specific way �things are done� in the project and as such can serve for defect detection and defect prevention. The technique of mining evolution patterns is implemented as a basis for the LAMARCK tool, presented in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{developed}} implementing TRIZ (Russian acronym of Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) for eco-innovative design tasks, es- tablishing a link between eco-efficiency and the Inventive Principles and the Contradiction Matrix.

40|$|The {{idea that}} there are any {{large-scale}} <b>trends</b> in the <b>evolution</b> of biological organisms is highly controversial. It is commonly believed, for example, {{that there is a}} large-scale <b>trend</b> in <b>evolution</b> towards increasing complexity, but empirical and theoretical arguments undermine this belief. Natural selection results in organisms that are well adapted to their local environ- ments, {{but it is not clear}} how local adaptation can produce a global trend. In this paper, I present a simple computational model, in which local adaptation to a randomly changing environment results in a global trend towards increasing evolutionary versatility. In this model, for evolutionary versatility to increase without bound, the environment must be highly dynamic. The model also shows that unbounded evolutionary versatility implies an accelerating evolutionary pace. ! believe that unbounded increase in evolutionary versatility is a large-scale <b>trend</b> in <b>evolution.</b> ! discuss some of the testable predictions about organismal evolution that are suggested by the model...|$|R

40|$|As {{the search}} for the {{understanding}} of governance in the context of development goes on, this paper offers a way of looking at particulars of the concept, as well as the effects of empirical governance activities in the conceptual evolution of the term. The central argument is that the current governance framework has evolved to incorporate the values of various actors, notwithstanding the dominance of market values. Importantly, new trends in governance suggest a slow but increasing acceptance of the underlying principles of the current framework. The apparent evolution of the concept seems to reflect the process of increased interaction between actors and the sum total of their experiences.

Econometric analysis of this study includes a set of variables part of demand for imports. Based on theoretical principles and research experience, the analysis in this paper consists in treating imports as a function not only of GDP (economic activity), effective exchange rate, but also as a function of remittances and the level of liberalization of the trade regime, represented by the average import <b>tariff</b> (<b>trend</b> which clearly shows the progress of trade liberalization). The assessment of the impact of these factors is achieved using the vector error correction model (VECM = vector error correction model). At first, the analysis begins by specifying tests theoretical hypotheses and analytical equations, which describes the theoretical relationship. The following step consists on the selection of econometric model, which in our case was chosen to be the VECM model.
