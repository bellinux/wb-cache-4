2500|$|The acts of {{the council}} report: [...] "After {{the reading of the}} {{foregoing}} epistle, the most reverend bishops cried out: This is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the Apostles. So we all believe, thus the orthodox believe. Anathema to him who does not thus believe. Peter has spoken thus through Leo. So taught the Apostles. Piously and truly did Leo teach, so taught Cyril. Everlasting be the memory of Cyril. Leo and Cyril taught the same thing, anathema to him who does not so believe. This is the true faith. <b>Those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> orthodox thus believe. This is the faith of the fathers. Why were not these things read at Ephesus? These are the things Dioscorus hid away." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{relation}} to non-intersectional feminism in the United States, Lorde famously said, [...] "Those {{of us who}} stand outside the circle of this society's definition of acceptable women; {{those of us who}} have been forged in the crucibles of difference -- <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> poor, who are lesbians, who are Black, who are older -- know that survival is not an academic skill. It is learning how to take our differences and make them strengths. For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change. And this fact is only threatening to those women who still define the master's house as their only source of support." ...|$|E
2500|$|The pro-peace {{attitude}} {{of the people of}} the Soviet Union and People's China is not based on fear of war but on confidence in their theory and way of life. One Soviet trade unionist put the matter to us in this way. [...] "We are not afraid of war. We have been through it and survived its cruelties and horrors. We know that we can take it. Just because we have been through it and suffered from it, we know how terrible war is. It wastes materials, but worse than that, it squanders human idealism, energy, wealth and life. Still worse, <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> trying to build a socialist society are diverted and preoccupied by war. We know from bitter experience that if we are to engage in socialist construction we cannot fight wars. War is a full-time occupation." ...|$|E

"What is happening. <b>Those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> haven't {{anything}} rot in the cities. <b>Those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> have land, sell {{it and go}} to the cities. Some become larger capitalists; some go {{into the}} professions; the rest spend the money and start rotting when it's gone, and if it lasts their life-time their children do the rotting for them." ...|$|R

50|$|I am {{standing}} before {{you in this}} court so that the Almighty will be a witness before you and I. A witness to what is happening today to our beloved Iran and to its brave sons and daughters. So that upon the judgement day when we are held accountable, <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> stand proud and <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> hold our heads down will remember that such is destiny. The final reward and punishment is only by God.|$|R
2500|$|... "In {{the final}} analysis," [...] he wrote, [...] "a Justice's {{vote in a}} case like this depends more on his or her views about the {{respective}} lawmaking responsibilities of Congress and this Court than on conflicting policy interests. Judges who have confidence in their own ability to fashion public policy are less hesitant to change the law than <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> inclined to give wide latitude to the views of the voters' representatives on nonconstitutional matters." [...] While he had admittedly helped start the discussions about the various interpretations of Wilko in his dissent in Scherk v. Alberto-Culver, Inc. while chief judge of the Seventh Circuit, he said [...] "one of these arguments, however, carries sufficient weight to tip the balance between judicial and legislative authority and overturn an interpretation of an Act of Congress that has been settled for many years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is short}} and clear. <b>Those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> at Court always want money where it is needful if we would have {{advancement}} and earn the royal favour of one who does not pay, at least in gold." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Señora," [...] she continued, {{her dark}} eyes intensifying with {{awakening}} memories; [...] "could you have seen {{the beauty of the}} old Spanish life, then, with thy gentle heart, tears would now fall for <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> left." ...|$|E

Only the soldier knows That war is more than hell...|$|R

60|$|Nor are the art-treasures of {{this country}} at all {{exhausted}} by this Exhibition; there are very many great pictures by living artists hidden away in different places, which <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> yet boys have never seen, and which our elders must wish to see again.|$|E
60|$|Yea, {{that which}} maketh Launcelot so {{singularly}} dear {{to all the}} world, {{is that he was}} not different from other men, but like other men, both in his virtues and his shortcomings; only that he was more strong and more brave and more untiring than <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> his brethren, both in our endeavors and in our failures.|$|E
6000|$|Of {{this quality}} was their talk. To <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> old and dim-eyed, it seems of no account, perhaps, but {{to those who}} can {{remember}} similar walks and talks it is of higher worth than the lectures in the Sorbonne. Learning is a very chill abstraction on such a night to such a pair. Would we not all go back again to this sweet land of love and longing--if we could? ...|$|E
60|$|Some {{people are}} good, not from {{inherent}} love of virtue, but from sheer laziness. But <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> know weak moments may understand.|$|R

6000|$|Ned had his day, in the boyhood {{of each of}} us. We {{presently}} {{passed him}} by. I am speaking, of course, of <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> of maturer years and can look back upon thirty or forty years of fiction reading. [...] "Ned," [...] flourishes still, I understand, among the children of today. But now he flies in aeroplanes, and dives in submarines, and gives his invaluable military advice to General Joffre and General Pershing.|$|E
6000|$|My {{father was}} {{disposed}} to resent this. [...] "That's {{all very well}} for the few who have the level land {{in the middle of}} the valley," [...] he retorted, [...] "but how about <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> crowded against the hills? You should see the farm I have in Winnesheik!! Not a hill on it big enough for a boy to coast on. It's right on the edge of Looking Glass Prairie, and I have a spring of water, and a fine grove of trees just where I want them, not where they have to be grubbed out." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hitherto I {{have spoken}} of all aqueous vapor {{as if it}} were either {{transparent}} or white--visible by becoming opaque like snow, but not by any accession of color. But even <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> least observant of skies, know that, irrespective of all supervening colors from the sun, there are white clouds, brown clouds, gray clouds, and black clouds. Are these indeed--what they appear to be--entirely distinct monastic disciplines of cloud: Black Friars, and White Friars, and Friars of Orders Gray? Or is it only their various nearness to us, their denseness, and the failing of the light upon them, that makes some clouds look black[13] and others snowy? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let this be our meeting-place," [...] he said, as {{they were}} on the point of {{starting}} off together; [...] "and let <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> have fire-arms discharge them occasionally." ...|$|R

60|$|I have no intention, my dears, of {{dwelling}} {{upon that}} part of my adventures which must be as painful to you as to me, the very recollection of which, after all these years, suffices to cause the blood within me to run cold. In my youth men whose natures shrank not from encounter with their enemies lacked not, I warrant you, a checkered experience. <b>Those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> wound the tightest go the farthest and strike the hardest. Nor is it difficult for one, the last of whose life is being recorded, to review the outspread roll of it, and trace the unerring forces which have drawn for themselves.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish we {{had nothing}} worse than the Hereafter to fear," [...] said Francisco with a sigh. [...] "It is the journey thither that is so terrible. As for our expedition, having {{undertaken}} it, I think on the whole that we had better persevere, especially as the senora wishes it, and she {{is very hard to}} turn. After all our lives {{are in the hands of}} the Almighty, and therefore we shall be just as safe, or unsafe, among the People of the Mist as in a European city. <b>Those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> destined to live will live, and those whose hour is at hand must die. And now good night, for I am going to sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's the uselessness of it, {{for this}} age," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I think clergymen don't {{understand}} the harm {{it is doing}} in concentrating the attention on such a vulnerable and non-essential point. <b>Those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> striving to reorganize our beliefs and make them tenable, do not bother our heads about miracles. They may be true, or may not, or {{some of them may}} be. We are beginning to see that the virgin birth does not add anything to Christ. We are beginning to see that perfection and individuality are not incompatible,--one is divine, and the other human. And isn't it by his very individuality that we are able to recognize Jesus to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, we don't," [...] she said, [...] "not <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> think. We know {{we shall}} never oust man from his place. He {{will always be}} the greater. We want to help him; that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Rilla, {{under her}} breath. She was seeing {{a little white}} cross on a {{battlefield}} of France. [...] "No--not if <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> live will show ourselves worthy of it--if we 'keep faith.'" ...|$|R
2500|$|Lucille Ball said: [...] "I've {{lost one}} of my dearest friends and show {{business}} has {{lost one of}} the greatest character actors <b>of</b> all time. <b>Those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> knew him and loved him will miss him." ...|$|R
60|$|LUBIN. Quite so. My {{idea is that}} whilst {{we should}} {{interest}} the electorate in this {{as a sort of}} religious aspiration and personal hope, using {{it at the same time}} to remove their prejudices against <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> getting on in years, it would be in the last degree upsetting and even dangerous to enable everyone to live longer than usual. Take the mere question of the manufacture of the specific, whatever it may be! There are forty millions of people in the country. Let me assume for the sake of illustration that each person would have to consume, say, five ounces a day of the elixir. That would be--let me see--five times three hundred and sixty-five is--um--twenty-five--thirty-two--eighteen--eighteen hundred and twenty-five ounces a year: just two ounces over the hundredweight.|$|E
60|$|When <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{still left}} of that band of {{children}} who played long {{years ago in the}} old orchard and walked the golden road together in joyous companionship, foregather now and again in our busy lives and talk over the events of those many merry moons--there are some of our adventures that gleam out more vividly in memory than the others, and are oftener discussed. The time we bought God's picture from Jerry Cowan--the time Dan ate the poison berries--the time we heard the ghostly bell ring--the bewitchment of Paddy--the visit of the Governor's wife--and the night we were lost in the storm--all awaken reminiscent jest and laughter; but none more than the recollection of the Sunday Peg Bowen came to church and sat in our pew. Though goodness knows, as Felicity would say, we did not think it any matter for laughter at the time--far from it.|$|E
60|$|But its {{parallels}} are respectable. The greatest {{things have}} a way of coming “all so still” into the world. We wrangle—that is, <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not content simply not to know—about the composition of Homer, the purpose of the Divina Commedia, the probable plan of the Canterbury Tales, the Ur-Hamlet. Nobody put preliminary advertisements in the papers, you see, about these things: there was a discreditable neglect of the first requirements of the public. So it is with Esmond. There is, I thought, a reference to it in the Brookfield letters; but in several searches I cannot find it. To his mother he speaks of the book as “grand and melancholy”, and to Lady Stanley as of “cut-throat melancholy”. It {{is said to have been}} sold for a thousand pounds—the same sum that Master Shallow lent Falstaff on probably inferior security. Those who knew thought well of it—which is not wholly surprising.|$|E
60|$|The old man {{expressed}} the feeling <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> were too shy and delicate of speech {{to do it}} justice, and we led him on to most satisfying blasphemy {{of the land and}} the road-gang.|$|R
