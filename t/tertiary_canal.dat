50|$|The <b>tertiary</b> <b>canal</b> {{which serves}} this {{community}} is 6-7 km long. Cleaning {{is carried out}} by the land owners’ sharecroppers on an as-needs basis, as the canal does not suffer from heavy silting. Those who do not own land or work on the irrigated land do not participate in any of the cleaning activities. Cleaning is usually done from the head of the canal to the tail, but the system is flexible. The labourers work as a gang and divide the cleaning allocation between them. Work is allocated proportionally to the amount of land and water rights of each landlord or sharecropper at the rate of one person per day for those with less than 20 jerib (4 ha) of land, and two people per day for those with over 20 jerib. Only one or two individuals own more than 50 jerib. A landlord with 30 jerib of land, or his sharecroppers, is Social Water Management 17 expected to clean more metreage of the canal than a land owner with 10 jerib, since under the traditional hashar system the former landlord is required to provide more labourers than those with less land. Under normal circumstances it will take the community 6-7 days to clean the canal from head to tail. In the last two years’ cleaning cycle, the hashar system has been modified because of external interventions implemented by an international organisation (a Food-for-Work programme in the first year and a Cash-for-Work programme in the second). In the former, labourers (not just sharecroppers or land owners) were paid at the rate of 7 kg of wheat per working day, in the latter, payment was at the rate of US$2.50 per day.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the fairness in distribution {{of water in}} a <b>tertiary</b> <b>canal</b> within the Indus Basin Irrigation System. Two methodologies are proposed: canal rating equations, and outlet discharge equations. The methodology is applied to a <b>tertiary</b> <b>canal</b> located in the Punjab, Province of Pakistan. Fairness/equity is expressed quantitatively using the Gini index. There is {{a difference in the}} estimated discharge depending on the methodology employed, however as we move along the canal the water allowance does not vary significantly with the distance along the canal. Hence for this particular canal the head-middle-tail inequity often reported and generalized in the literature is not observed. The advantage of a quantitative measure of inequity such as the Gini is exemplified by comparing the Gini with that at the secondary canal and also against itself if the <b>tertiary</b> <b>canal</b> could be operated “as designed”. We introduce two new concepts: systematic and operational inequity. Provided the costs of data acquisition can be reduced this technology {{has the potential to be}} scaled up and included in future development investments in large scale irrigation systems.

40|$|Due to {{extensive}} groundwater {{development in}} the recent past, Pakistan now faces enormous challenges of groundwater management as it struggles to ensure food security for its rapidly growing population. These management challenges require a re-balancing of surface and groundwater monitoring objectives and approaches in the country. This article presents {{the current status of}} the groundwater monitoring and management in Pakistan. A compelling case is presented for optimization of material resources in improving groundwater level and quality data by proposing to use farmer organizations as a source of crowd sourced groundwater information. The authors showcase new methods to collect groundwater data and demonstrate use of automatic recording instruments for groundwater monitoring in a <b>tertiary</b> <b>canal</b> command area in the Pakistan’s Punjab. The results suggest that the potential for broader impact by engaging farmer organization and expanding monitoring networks is attractive. A common concern about long term deployment of automatic instruments is that the observation wells are not purged before extracting water quality samples. The authors address this concern through a field experiment by utilizing capabilities of automatic recording instruments...|$|E

Public {{investments}} in farmer-managed <b>tertiary</b> <b>canals</b> can promote an improved distribution of water among farmers, {{enabling them to}} improve water management practices, enhance crop yields, and select from {{a wider variety of}} cropping choices. This paper examines economic issues regarding public programs designed to improve or rehabilitate <b>tertiary</b> <b>canals,</b> particularly in developing countries. Key issues include defining property rights to irrigation water or delivery capacity, and to new or improved irrigation facilities; communicating the relative scarcity of agricultural inputs with appropriate prices or allocations; implementing cost recovery; and determining the best mix of public and private sector participation. The transaction costs of implementing market-oriented programs are also discussed. Economic issues are illustrated by describing Egypt’s national Irrigation Improvement Project, for which a set of alternative cost recovery programs is presented.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrated}} how a modeling {{approach can be}} used to find the optimal mix of farmers' water management practices to improve irrigation efficiency at the tertiary level in collective canal schemes. The approach is developed for the case of the Office du Niger and based on a field study of 3 years. First, a simulation model is presented in which all relevant physical and social aspects of water management at the farmers' level are considered. Next, simulations are performed to evaluate the impact on performance of different combinations of management practices and different external conditions. Finally, the combinations are selected that succeed in limiting seasonal water consumption to 1, 400 mm and avoiding irrigation problems, but which are also realistic from a farmer's point of view. Results demonstrate that in the Office du Niger, where seasonal water consumption per hectare should be reduced by about 30 %, a tight control of the tertiary intake in combination with a good maintenance of the <b>tertiary</b> <b>canal</b> should be proposed. Although the model software is built especially for the case of the Office du Niger, the concept of the model can be transferred to other irrigation schemes, as it uses only simple hydraulic principles and limited data input. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{irrigation}} efficiency in irrigation schemes {{has always been}} high {{on the agenda of}} policy makers. Despite quite some ‘social’ experiments, whereby large portions of management were carried over to the farmer level, results often remained disappointing. This paper explores why this came about for a case study in the Office du Niger irrigation scheme in Mali. Since Irrigation Management Transfer, farmers are responsible for the tertiary level, but collective action for water management remains below expectations. This paper applies an analytical framework based on the conceptual model developed by van Noordwijk et al. (Conserv Ecol 5 : 21, 2002) and proceeding in two steps. Firstly, an interview-based stakeholder analysis assesses the objectives and mental models of farmers and the central management regarding water management. It appears from the interviews that the central management wants to increase {{irrigation efficiency}} through fully-fledged collective action, whereas farmers value the latter only when it favours easy irrigation. Secondly, the relation between collective action and performance was tested through a field study on a sample of 36 tertiary blocks. Results indicate that only collective action at the inlet of the <b>tertiary</b> <b>canal,</b> currently implemented on {{less than a third of}} the tertiary blocks, increases irrigation efficiency (with 14 %). Collective action for water allocation is implemented within almost three quarters of tertiary blocks and effectively reduces irrigation problems. However, if they lack the necessary social capital, not all farmers can establish collective action when needed. Based on this analysis, the paper proposes a mix of incentives and measures to resolve the conflict between farmers and the central management to their mutual benefit. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine water conveyance loss in the open canal irrigation network that serves the irrigation areas on the right and left banks of the Menemen Plain, in {{the lower part of the}} Gediz Basin. The research was carried out in the main, secondary, and tertiary canals. Water conveyance loss in the canals was measured by the inflow-outflow method, while water velocity was determined using a current-meter. Statistical relationships between canal types, canal shapes, and seepage loss were also investigated. The water conveyance loss at the main canal level was between 0. 5 % and 1. 3 % (0. 0071 - 0. 0126 l s- 1 m- 2) per 1 km in the left bank main canal, and between 0. 6 % and 8. 6 % (0. 0024 - 0. 0361 l s- 1 m- 2) per 1 km in the right bank main canal. The average loss was 3. 0 % (0. 0141 l s- 1 m- 2). At the secondary canal level the average water conveyance loss for the trapezoidal canals on the left bank was 2. 0 % (0. 0615 l s- 1 m- 2) per 100 m and for the concrete flumes on the right bank it was 4. 0 % per 100 m. Average conveyance loss at the tertiary level on the left bank was 7. 0 % (0. 0598 l s- 1 m- 2) per 100 m for the trapezoidal canals and 5. 1 % per 100 m for the concrete flumes. For the concrete flumes on the right bank the figure was 6. 5 % per 100 m. Based on the statistical analysis, there was no significant difference for seepage loss between secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>canal</b> types (X secondary = 18. 600 a ± 4. 404 and X tertiary = 9. 17...|$|E

40|$|A key {{operational}} objective {{for the management}} of the Indus Basin Irrigation System of Pakistan is the distribution of water among <b>tertiary</b> <b>canals</b> in a transparent and equitable manner.

This paper uses operations research tools to develop a Canal Operations Planner. Allocation cost is defined {{as a function of the}} delivery performance ratio and maximizing this function. The performance of the modules is evaluated using spillage and the Gini index as a measure of equity. Two models, namely; linear programme-delivery performance ratio (LP-DPR) and non linear programme-delivery performance ratio (NLP-DPR) are presented and the results are compared to performance under current canal planning and operational practice.

It is based on a separate modelling of the water supply and demand, including (i) a simplified representation of the hydraulic structure, characteristics and organizational parameters of the scheme, (ii) an assessment of the water demand of farms based on their total irrigated area, cropping pattern and irrigation practices, (iii) a farm typology, (iv) a confrontation between water demand and supply at each node of the scheme from pumping plants to <b>tertiary</b> <b>canals,</b> and (v) calculation of response factors between supply and demand during the peak demand period. "What-if" scenarios are simulated in order to enhance the stakeholders' capacity to plan strategic decisions such as water delivery allocation rules or infrastructure investments. WaDI was implemented on two Brazilian schemes. It allowed broadening the stakeholders' limited representation of collective water supply and demand into a more comprehensive understanding of these relations. The approach however showed some limits, along with the difficulty of assessing the real impact on the stakeholders' capacity for strategic planning. ...|$|R

Due to high seasonal variation with over 90 % of rainfall and surface water concentrated during the flood season from May to November, the great potential for agriculture and aquaculture production in the MRD is only exploited if flood is controlled and irrigation in the dry season is improved.

40|$|Lack of {{accurate}} information on water distribution within an irrigation {{system is a}} major roadblock for effective management of scarce water resources. Numerical techniques to estimate canal water distribution require large amounts of data with respect to hydraulic parameters and operation of the hydraulic structures; such data are absent in large irrigation systems. In this study, six quantitative geomatic models, with varying complexity and physical representation, were formulated. They all use high-spatial resolution Landsat- 7 images and a canal network stored in a GIS. The models require only the flow rates {{at the head of}} the distribution system to calculate downstream water distribution. Results were compared with discharge measurements for three <b>tertiary</b> <b>canals</b> (watercourses) within two selected secondary canals (distributaries), Gajiana and Ghour Dour, in Rechna Doab, Pakistan. The model that computed canal water distribution using the shape of the irrigated area was the most accurate at the watercourse scale. The overall deviation was 28 % and the standard deviation of differences between modelled and measured flow was 10 %. The model that relates canal water distribution directly to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has the lowest accuracy with a 32 % absolute deviation and 16 % standard deviation. We conclude that geo-information techniques can be used to compute water distribution in large irrigation systems with a minimum of field data if an appropriate geomatic model is selecte...|$|R

Dynamic closed chambers were used to measure soil CO 2 efflux from January to September 2012. Chambers were placed in pairs, with one close to a tree/palm and the other at mid-distance to the next tree/palm. In the oil palm plantation additional chambers were placed in frond decomposing lines and <b>tertiary</b> drainage <b>canals.</b> During the experiment, air and soil temperatures, water table level and rainfall were recorded. The fluxes were significantly larger in the oil palm plantation (28. 4 ± 1. 2 Mg C-CO 2 ha– 1 y– 1) than in the transitional logged drained forest (18. 5 ± 0. 7 Mg C-CO 2 ha– 1 y– 1) and in the intact peat swamp forest (16. 0 ± 1. 2 Mg C-CO 2 ha– 1 y– 1).

40|$|The {{operation}} of an {{upstream and downstream}} control irrigation systems was studied at main, secondary and tertiary levels with regard to water saving. The study focused on {{the investigation of the}} existing operational practices and evaluation of alternate operational options. The main goal was to study water saving strategies in downstream control systems. The study is based on the integrated use of different models and approaches at different levels of an irrigation system. At main canal level Crop Based Irrigation Operations (CBIO) model was applied as a water saving strategy. The model computes irrigation rotations among secondary canals in a downstream control system. It was applied to a real system of irrigation named as Maira Branch of Upper Swat Canal, Pakistan. For investigations at secondary level, Canalman model was applied to five Secondary canals and one main branch of the Upper Swat Canal Irrigation System. The main operational strategies evaluated at secondary level were night closure of secondary canals in the periods of low irrigation demand and {{operation of}} the canals at reduced discharges. Performance assessment was made to determine the feasibility of secondary canal operation at different discharges. Modifications in outlet dimensions were estimated for better performance. At tertiary level Geographical Information System (GIS) based modeling was used to compute the monthly irrigation durations of different fields and by different users of a tertiary unit. Some data was collected in collaboration with International Water Management Institute and NWFP Irrigation Department. This included discharges of the main canals and design data of the main and secondary canals.

By using household-level data collected in a large-scale gravity irrigation scheme in Uganda, whose management was transferred from the government to the community, we find that household contributions to the cleaning of irrigation channels are determined by the scarcity of irrigation water, the opportunity cost of labor and the private benefit associated with plot size. We also find that the availability of irrigation water increases in the <b>tertiary</b> irrigation <b>canal</b> where the coefficient of variation of plot size is large, which may indicate that farmers of larger plots are particularly active in water management. These findings suggest that farmers are responsive to private benefits and, hence, the support of the government for communities to implement punishment may be effective for successful irrigation management. ...|$|R

In Mauritania, average land productivity of rice schemes lies between 3 and 3. 5 tha - 1 and irrigated land has progressively being abandoned. At the same time, there is new international attention towards interventions in large-scale irrigation in the Sahel. Spatial and temporal variability of production are main causes of low productivity of large-scale {{irrigation schemes}} in Mauritania and threats to their sustainability. The present paper {{focuses on the}} performance of three representative large-scale schemes located along the River Senegal by analysing intra-scheme variability with respect to yield and irrigation intensity using field observations and satellite images. A sample of <b>tertiary</b> <b>canals</b> was selected in each irrigation scheme for weekly surveys of irrigation processes and maintenance. Yield measurement, irrigation (II) and harvest intensity (HI), indicators of irrigation adequacy (IIA) and drainage adequacy (IDA) constituted the basis of this analysis. Semi-structured interviews with the different actors at the various management levels (farmers; cooperatives; union of cooperatives; state irrigation agency; and the private service provider managing the water delivery in one of the schemes) were held in order to gain information on irrigation and drainage infrastructure, organisation and management of the schemes, financial aspects and irrigated surface. Within each irrigation scheme, a great variability was detected with respect to irrigation intensity and yield. Irrigation intensity could vary as much as from 0 to 1 whilst yield could range from 0. 4 to 7 tha - 1 in a single scheme. The analysis of water distribution patterns at scheme level indicated that variability in irrigation supplies and drainage were main sources of variability of yields and irrigation intensity. Physical, technical, and organisational factors underlie non-uniform water distribution patterns. The understanding of the origins of patterns of variability is a first step towards a more realistic assessment of schemes' sustainability and contribution to food security. © 2012 Elsevier B. V.

The Pursat River is one of tributaries of the Tonle Sap Great Lake. It originates at Cardamom Mountains and has very good potential for agricultural development. In this paper, we aim at applying three models of irrigation system for basin planning: Chinit (Dam-Reservoir Irrigation), West Baray (Reservoir Irrigation) and Batheay (Shallow Reservoir Irrigation) to Pursat Basin (one of sub-basin of the Tonle Sap Great Lake). Chinit Dam-Reservoir stores water supplied by one of tributaries of Tonle Sap Great Lake, the Chinit River, located in Kampong Thom Province. Spillway is built to pass up inundation and to release water to downstream part. The rest of water in the Dam-Reservoir is distributed to the paddy field by main canal, secondary <b>canals</b> and <b>tertiary</b> <b>canals.</b> This system can be put at the upstream part of the Pursat River, mountainous area. The West Baray Irrigation system is characterized by a reservoir combined with a dike system in the floodplain of the Tonle Sap Great Lake and an irrigation system situated in Siem Reap province. The reservoir is supplied by a tributary of the Tonle Sap Great Lake, the Siem Reap River, in rainy season. The water is distributed to irrigation area in dry season. A small dike system was constructed in the Tonle Sap floodplain for retarding and storing floodwater. The stored floodwater is used as an additional water source for dry season cultivation. This system can be placed at the central plain of the Pursat Basin. Batheay reservoir directly receives floodwater from the Mekong River. It functions as both a reservoir and a paddy field. In wet season, dike around the Batheay reservoir prevents floodwater from entering the reservoir. Rainy season rice is grown inside the reservoir. After harvesting, gates around the reservoir are opened to receive floodwater. The water is stored for cultivating dry season rice outside the reservoir.
