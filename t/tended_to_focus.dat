5|$|The PC and Macintosh {{versions}} of Star Wars: Dark Forces were well received, with the MS-DOS version holding an aggregate score on GameRankings of 77%. Publications compared Dark Forces to Doom, a significant video {{game in the}} first-person shooter genre at the time, but also indicated that Dark Forces improved upon Dooms features. Criticisms <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on the game being too short, as well as lacking a multiplayer feature.|$|E

She represented the United States during her foreign trips, which <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on HIV/AIDS and malaria awareness.|$|E
5|$|The Search for Spock {{opened on}} June 1, 1984. In its {{first week of}} release, the film grossed over $16 million from almost 2,000 theaters across North America. It went on to gross $76 million at the {{domestic}} box office, {{with a total of}} $87 million worldwide. Critical reaction to The Search for Spock was positive, but notably less so than the previous film. Reviewers generally praised the cast and characters, while criticism <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on the plot; the special effects were conflictingly received. Roger Ebert called the film a compromise between the tones of the first and second Star Trek films. The Search for Spock has since been released on multiple home video formats, including VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray high definition discs. Nimoy went on to direct The Search for Spocks sequel, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{material}} written about her was aimed at children, and <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on her childhood and early career. Much of it was also highly romanticised and not always historically accurate. She has been referenced in several historical novels, most notably in The French Lieutenant's Woman (1969) by John Fowles, who was critical {{of the fact that}} no British scientist had named a species after her in her lifetime. As her biographer, Shelley Emling, noted, this contrasted with some of the prominent geologists who had used her finds, such as William Buckland and Roderick Murchison, who ended up with multiple fossil species named after them. The only person who did name a species after her during her lifetime was the Swiss-American naturalist, Louis Agassiz. In the early 1840s, he named two fossil fish species after her—Acrodus anningiae, and Belenostomus anningiae—and another after her friend Elizabeth Philpot. Agassiz was grateful for the help the women had given him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834. After her death, other species, including the ostracod Cytherelloidea anningi, and two genera, the therapsid reptile genus Anningia, and the bivalve mollusc genus Anningella, were named in her honour. In 2012, the plesiosaur genus Anningasaura was named for her, and the species Ichthyosaurus anningae was named for her in 2015.|$|E

25|$|Bound in Blood {{received}} mainly positive reviews. Most critics {{praised the}} plot, the general shooting mechanics, the game's authentic western tone, and the multiplayer mode. Criticism <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on poor enemy AI, repetitive level design, and, especially, {{the lack of}} any kind of co-op mode. Some critics also found the single-player mode too short and easy. The game was a commercial success, selling close to one million units worldwide across all systems, considerably more than the first game.|$|E
25|$|By the 19th century, {{the liberals}} had evolved into Unitarians.

Unitarians did not participate in evangelistic societies due to their conviction that people informed by reason and scripture should be free to believe what they wanted. When they did organize, they <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on education and philanthropic causes.|$|E

He was a driving force behind the creation of the Army League, a pressure group designed to keep the needs of the British Army before the public.|$|E

By the 1950s the school had become well-known internationally, and showed their work at leading exhibitions such as the São Paulo Art Biennial in 1955. The Croatian Museum of Naive Art in Zagreb has a comprehensive display of the works of the Hlebine School and other naive artists.|$|E

As the 18th century progressed, the content of encyclopedias also changed according to readers’ tastes.

The bank's structural adjustment programs contributed to urbanization in the Third World by creating incentives to move to cities. The World Bank and UN-Habitat in 1999 jointly established the Cities Alliance (based at the World Bank headquarters in Washington, D.C.) to guide policymaking, knowledge sharing, and grant distribution around the issue of urban poverty.

Originally, it featured the guitar, fiddle, string bass, and steel guitar (imported from Hawaiian folk music). The vocals were originally rough and nasal, as exemplified by the singer-songwriters Floyd Tillman and Hank Williams, but later developed a clear and sharp sound, such as that of George Jones and Faron Young. Lyrics <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on working-class life, with frequently tragic themes of lost love, adultery, loneliness, alcoholism, and self-pity.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{features}} of the British metrication programme as announced in 1966 was a voluntary adoption of the metric programme with the costs being absorbed where they fell. As a result, the costs and savings of metrication in the United Kingdom have not been comprehensively determined and studies have <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on specific programmes. The impact of a voluntary programme meant that industry was free to take the most cost-efficient approach, which in many cases has meant installing equipment calibrated in metric units {{as part of an}} ongoing maintenance cycle rather than as part of a specific metrication programme. Such an approach was taken by the gas industry where all newly installed meters record usage in cubic metres, but many older installations will measure in cubic feet.|$|E
