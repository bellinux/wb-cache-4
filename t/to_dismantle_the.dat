5|$|As {{dissatisfaction with}} the secession grew, Ngalula and other South Kasaian émigrés in Léopoldville plotted to {{overthrow}} the regime in Bakwanga. In September 1962, the Léopoldville government appointed Albert Kankolongo as Special Commissioner (commissaire extraordinaire), giving him full military and civil power, <b>to</b> <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> local state. Ngalula approached Kankolongo to lead a mutiny and coup d'état against Kalonji.|$|E
5|$|Following John V's death, Manuel II Palaeologus {{was able}} to secure his throne and {{establish}} {{good relations with the}} Sultan, becoming his vassal.

50|$|All three {{remaining}} WF class locomotives were withdrawn in December 1956 when <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> of <b>the</b> railway was completed. At {{the time}} there was consideration <b>to</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>the</b> locomotives and transporting them to Picton. This did not eventuate, and the three locomotives were scrapped in 1957. Any useful parts were then taken on to Picton and used as spares for their two WF class locomotives.|$|R

5|$|The {{tower was}} closed in 1914 {{following}} {{the outbreak of}} the First World War, for the duration of which the steel structure was not maintained and consequently became rusty. During the war the government made unsuccessful attempts to buy the tower for its metal. Controversy still surrounds the decision <b>to</b> <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> tower after the war ended; some still believe the structure was safe and could have been repaired. Demolition began in 1919 and by 1921 only the ballroom remained. The metal was sold to scrap dealers.|$|E
5000|$|By the 1990s the {{building}} had fallen into significant disrepair. In 2000 the 4-story [...] "cupola" [...] {{at the top of}} {{the building}} was demolished because of structural deterioration and safety concerns, after chunks of terra cotta began falling from the facade. Damage was sufficiently extensive that consideration was given <b>to</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>the</b> remaining 17 stories of the octagonal spire as well.|$|R

5|$|The {{volume of}} fire rapidly increased, when enemy {{vehicles}} {{could be seen}} moving towards the villa from the nearby woods; this in particular worried Frost, as the radio sets the force had been issued failed to work, giving him no means of communication with his other detachments, including 'Nelson' who were tasked with clearing the evacuation beach. Fortunately for the British, Flight Sergeant Cox and several sappers arrived at this time and proceeded <b>to</b> <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> radar equipment, placing the pieces on specially designed trolleys.|$|E
5|$|Though much of {{the mythology}} {{surrounding}} the patrol and the site has dissipated in the national consciousness since the country's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980, World's View endures as a tourist attraction to this day. A campaign in the 1990s <b>to</b> <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> monument and remove the graves met with strong opposition from both local residents and the Department of National Museums and Monuments, {{partly because of the}} income it brings from visitors, and partly out of respect for the site and the history surrounding it.|$|E
5|$|After {{securing}} {{additional financing}} from Eurimages and ARTE, Tarr used these and the Hungarian funds to undertake nine days of shooting on sets {{he had built}} {{at a cost of}} €2 million. The French funding was cross-financed for the shoot by T. T. Filmműhely. As funds were frozen however, the Corsican subcontractor Tanit Films (controlled by the film's then-executive producer Jean-Patrick Costantini), terminated their contract with Balsan and through legal action compelled the production <b>to</b> <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> sets and leave the shooting location. At that point, Ognon Pictures shut the production down and disassociated themselves from the film, and Tarr withdrew to Hungary to regroup.|$|E

5000|$|On 1 September 2010, at 11:30, Jeanne d'Arc's colours {{and name}} were withdrawn, {{formally}} ending {{her life as}} a ship in the Marine Nationale. This last ceremony of the colours on Jeanne d'Arc was held in the ship's home port of Brest. Following disarmament in l'Arsenal basin at Brest the ship continued to be moored at the naval base. On 9 September 2010 the former Jeanne d'Arc was removed of its naval number R 97 and moved to Piriouas as the hull Q 860 to conduct the work of securing the hulk and extracting the remaining recoverable hardware. The task of establishing an inventory of hazardous materials present on the vessel will take place in the naval yards prior <b>to</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>the</b> hull and could take up to two years. A tender will then be spent for its <b>dismantling.</b> <b>The</b> French Navy currently has 76 hulks ready <b>to</b> be <b>dismantled.</b> <b>The</b> issue remains sensitive following problems arising from <b>the</b> disposal and <b>dismantling</b> of <b>the</b> former [...] In 2014 it was decided that Jeanne d'Arc would be dismantled at Bordeaux by the Bartin Recycling Group and Pétrofer, subsidiaries of Veolia Group. The contract was worth approximately 11.5 million Euros.|$|R
5|$|After the Civil War, Powell {{was made}} a baronet by Charles II. Although it is {{unrecorded}} when Bodiam Castle was dismantled (slighted), it was probably after it was bought by Powell. During and after the Civil War, many castles were slighted {{to prevent them from}} being reused. Not all were destroyed completely, and in some cases care was taken not to unnecessarily deface the structure. At Bodiam, it was deemed sufficient <b>to</b> <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> barbican, the bridges, and the buildings inside the castle. When Nathaniel Powell died in 1674 or 1675, Bodiam Castle was passed on to his son, also called Nathaniel. After the second Nathaniel, the castle came into the possession of Elizabeth Clitherow, his daughter-in-law.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was furious}} over {{the failure to}} destroy the convoy, and ordered that all {{remaining}} German major warships be broken up for scrap. In protest, Raeder resigned; Hitler replaced him with Admiral Karl Dönitz, who persuaded Hitler to rescind the order <b>to</b> <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> Kriegsmarine's surface ships. In March, Lützow moved to Altafjord, where she experienced problems with her diesel engines. The propulsion system proved to be so problematic that repairs in Germany were necessary. She briefly returned to Norway, {{but by the end}} of September 1943, a thorough overhaul was required. The work was completed in Kiel by January 1944, after which she remained in the Baltic Sea to conduct training cruises for new naval personnel.|$|E
5|$|Operation Dragoon {{also had}} {{political}} implications. Two {{days after the}} landing, the Germans proceeded <b>to</b> <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> Vichy France government. Members of the Sicherheitsdienst stormed French government institutions and moved the Vichy French officials, including Philippe Pétain, to Belfort in Eastern France. Later, they were moved to Sigmaringen in Germany, where they acted as a Vichy French government in exile. With {{the collapse of the}} Vichy French government, troops of the FFI took over and resumed control of the French political institutions. Antony Beevor comments that The landings in the south of France prompted a rapid German withdrawal and thus reduced the damage and suffering done to France.|$|E

5|$|Chance leads Natasha to {{his uncle}} Douvee's (Wilford Brimley) house {{deep in the}} bayou, and enlists his help in {{defeating}} the men. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee lead the hunting party to a warehouse of old damaged Mardi Gras floats and statues, called Mardi Gras graveyard, and even kill off Fouchon's men one by one. Van Cleef is finally gunned down by Chance in a shootout. In the end only Fouchon is left, but he holds Chance at bay by taking Natasha hostage and stabbing Douvee in the chest with an arrow. Chance charges him, attacking with a flurry of blows, and then drops a grenade in his pants. Fouchon attempts <b>to</b> <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> grenade, but fails and gets incenerated in the explosion. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee now make {{their way out of}} the warehouse.|$|E
5|$|Elsa {{plans to}} give Anna a {{surprise}} birthday party {{with the help}} of Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf; but while Anna is led on a party treasure hunt by a string that winds through the kingdom, Elsa has caught a cold, and unknowingly produces a group of small living snowmen with each sneeze, who begin <b>to</b> <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> birthday party's decorations while Kristoff tries to stop them. While Elsa takes Anna on the hunt, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf try to control the snowmen and fix the decorations in time for Anna and Elsa's return. After Elsa nearly falls off a clock tower, Anna convinces her to take rest. While Anna enjoys the party, Elsa sneezes a giant snowball through an alphorn, inadvertently stunning Hans overseas; whereupon Elsa rests in bed under Anna's care. Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven escort the small snowmen to Elsa's ice palace, where they stay with her snow-giant doorkeeper Marshmallow.|$|E
5|$|In March 1997 E/R Partners {{settled with}} Aetna, {{receiving}} around $300 million. After {{the legal issues}} were settled E/R Partners announced the building would be dismantled. With {{the announcement of the}} demolition the city dropped its lawsuit against the owners. Unable to implode the building because of the building density of the area, E/R Partners began an eighteen-month, $23 million process <b>to</b> <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> building. Early in the process, which began in 1998, the owners hoped someone would buy the property as is or with the damaged portion of the structure removed, but that hope was soon abandoned. The process was finished in 1999. At the time of the demolition it was the third tallest habitable building ever razed and is currently the seventh, ranking after the World Trade Center's twin towers, the Singer Building, and the original Seven World Trade Center in New York, the Morrison Hotel in Chicago, and 130 Liberty Street in New York.|$|E
50|$|The German-Soviet Non Aggression Pact of 1939 {{during the}} Second World War led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> of <b>the</b> left-wing coalitions, as the Comintern then denounced the Popular Front strategy.

5|$|Inside a large, modernist house, Gerald (Lawson) {{turns on}} Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 {{and sits down}} to soup brought by his housekeeper, Kim (Veheary). Through the windows behind him, burglars Eddie (Pemberton) and Ray (Shearsmith) are seen. Ray enters the house, then lets in Eddie while Gerald is using the toilet. Eddie is shocked {{to see that the}} pair have come to steal an almost {{completely}} white painting. Ray starts <b>to</b> <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> painting while Eddie keeps watch; he tries to guide a Yorkshire Terrier out of the patio window, but inadvertently lets in an Irish Wolfhound. As Ray releases the wolfhound, Eddie accidentally throws the terrier into the window, so Ray stuffs the dog into an umbrella stand.|$|E
5|$|Mersea Fort {{was placed}} {{under the command of}} Captain William Burrell. Guns and {{ammunition}} were kept there in case of a fresh rebellion, with a garrison of 36 men, which was temporarily reinforced by an additional squadron of horsemen and 50 foot soldiers in July 1650. Repairs were made from 1651 onwards, and new accommodation was constructed for the fort's gunners. After an invasion scare in 1655, Mersea was temporarily used to imprison Royalists suspected of planning an insurgency against Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth government. The fort was then demobilised by Cromwell as part of his efforts to reduce defence costs; Burrell was ordered <b>to</b> <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> fort but the order was never carried out, partially because of the practical difficulties and because of opposition from the owner of the land. The admiralty court continued to be held in the fort, although it proved much harder to enforce the fishery rules because of the political turmoil.|$|E
5|$|The Ho-Chunks and Potawatomis, {{who took}} part in the war, were sometimes, {{motivated}} by grievances, not directly related to Black Hawk's objectives. One such incident was the Indian Creek massacre. In the spring of 1832, Potawatomis living along Indian Creek were upset that a settler named William Davis had dammed the creek, preventing fish from reaching their village. Davis ignored the protests, and assaulted a Potawatomi man who tried <b>to</b> <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> dam. The Black Hawk War provided the Indian Creek Potawatomis with an opportunity for revenge. On May 21, about fifty Potawatomis and three Sauks from the British Band attacked Davis's settlement, killing, scalping, and mutilating fifteen men, women, and children. Two teenage girls from the settlement were kidnapped and taken to Black Hawk's camp. A Ho-Chunk chief named White Crow negotiated their release two weeks later. Like other Rock River Ho-Chunks, White Crow was trying to placate the Americans while clandestinely aiding the British Band.|$|E
