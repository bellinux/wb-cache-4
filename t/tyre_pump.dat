25|$|Conditions {{improved}} in the 1930s and riders {{were allowed to}} accept a rain jacket, a spare <b>tyre</b> and a <b>pump,</b> but only in an emergency and at the judges' discretion. A change of bike was allowed only if a frame, wheel or handlebar broke, but riders were still expected to ride with spare <b>tyres</b> and a <b>pump.</b> Riders in the 1940s had to hand their bikes to officials {{the day before the}} race to have them identified with a lead seal, later with a ring similar to that fitted to racing pigeons. In that way the judges, or commissaires, could see if a rider had illegally changed bikes.|$|R
50|$|In 1920 {{to achieve}} greater depths, Fernez made the {{breathing}} tube 45 metres long and replaced the car <b>tyre</b> air <b>pump</b> {{with a more}} powerful pump operated by two men instead of one, This device is called the Fernez model 2. For shallow depths the diver could wear Fernez patented goggles, and for greater depths a rubber face mask with two lenses, one {{in front of each}} eye. Fernez received a visit from a Greek Trade Mission led by Mr. André Michalacopoulos, Minister of the Economy, to view the new Fernez model 2, and as a result an order was placed to supply sets of the equipment to Greece for use by sea sponge divers.|$|R
5000|$|Bucklands Beach {{was served}} by a single bus in the 1920s and 30s known as [...] "the Sheik" [...] which ran into the city and {{returned}} with city workers. The bus was a 36-seater Daimler Charbanc operated by Mrs Laird in the 1920s. This bus was sold and used in the South Seas Exhibition of 1925-26. In the late 1920s the Otahuhu-based Passenger Transport Service operated a service from Otahuhu, Papatoetoe to Bucklands Beach until 1939. A former employee Mr Tom Hadfield took over the service and founded the Bucklands and Eastern Bus Co Ltd running buses into central Auckland. He had 2 buses loaned from the Passenger Transport Company which during wartime restrictions were converted to run on a mix of petrol and kerosine. Repairs to the buses were done at night to keep them running and the <b>tyres</b> <b>pumped</b> up by hand. The fare was 2/6 (25 cents) for adults and 2d(2-3 cents) for children. In the late 1930s a bus took youngsters to Howick to attend pictures at the Monterey Theatre. The route to Howick was via the small Pakuranga post office, which stood on farm land opposite the present western entrance to Pakuranga College. In those days Maclean Road was just a grass walking track. The Bucklands and Eastern Bus company grew from this with its headquarters next to the bowling green {{at the foot of}} Devon Rd. From 1962 this was managed by the Wells family who lived opposite the headquarters in Devon Road. Both the Howick and the Bucklands /Eastern buses were owned by Mrs Cherry (formerly Mrs Hadfeld).About 1940 the Roberts family who lived at Pakuranga built a brick home cookery on the corner of Devon Rd and The Parade. The Robert's daughters were both very good cooks. The bakery was very popular with American servicemen on leave during World War II.|$|R
50|$|Fernez {{soon found}} that beyond {{a depth of}} one metre, or at most a metre and a half, inhaling air down the tube and exhaling it {{thorough}} the exhaust valve becomes impossible because of the pressure of water compressing the chest. He quickly realised that the air needed to be supplied to the diver under sufficient pressure to balance {{the pressure of the}} water at whatever depth the diver was operating. He added a manual Michelin air pump, the type used to inflate car <b>tyres,</b> to <b>pump</b> air down the tube, and also a clamp for the diver's nose to prevent water entry, and goggles to protect the eyes and permit underwater vision. Air was pumped continuously down the tube and flowed out of the exhaust valve of the mouthpiece, causing the pressure in the mouthpiece to be exactly the same as the external water pressure. The diver could breathe in and out from this stream of air without difficulty. This breathing apparatus was called the Fernez model 1.|$|R
