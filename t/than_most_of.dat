5|$|A {{waterspout}} is a columnar vortex forming {{over water}} that is, {{in its most}} common form, a non-supercell tornado over water that is connected to a cumuliform cloud. While it is often weaker <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> its land counterparts, stronger versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur.|$|E
5|$|After the {{reshuffling}} {{process of}} the Politburo ended in the mid-to-late 1970, the Soviet leadership evolved into a gerontocracy, a form of rule in which the rulers are significantly older <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the adult population.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{production}} difficulty and high price, lutetium has very few commercial uses, especially {{since it is}} rarer <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the other lanthanides but is chemically not very different. However, stable lutetium {{can be used as}} catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in alkylation, hydrogenation, and polymerization applications.|$|E

25|$|The {{ship had}} a {{deadweight}} tonnage, or carrying capacity, of approximately 81,000 tons, a measurement that {{put it at}} the small end of the Aframax class <b>of</b> tankers, smaller <b>than</b> <b>most</b> carriers <b>of</b> crude oil but larger <b>than</b> <b>most</b> carriers <b>of</b> refined products. It was classed by the American Bureau of Shipping and insured by the London Steam-Ship Owners' Mutual Insurance Association, a shipowners' mutual known as the London Club.|$|R

5|$|Many VNQDD {{members were}} part of the ARVN, which sought to prevent South Vietnam from being overrun by communists during the Vietnam War, and they were known for being more anti-communist <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> their compatriots.|$|E
5|$|While it {{is often}} weaker <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> its land counterparts, {{stronger}} versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur. Most waterspouts do not suck up water; they are small and weak rotating columns of air over water.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E

5|$|After {{taking a}} minor {{covering}} {{role in the}} return of British troops to Athens in October 1944, Ledbury was reduced to reserve in March 1946, and was not again commissioned for active service, remaining in peacetime commission longer <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> her class, before being sold for scrap in 1958. The destroyer was broken up at Rosyth in April 1958.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{socio-economic}} stagnation Brezhnev {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values. When Brezhnev died he left behind a gerontocracy, a group of leaders who were significantly older <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the adult population. Historians have largely agreed that Brezhnev's reign was one primarily of stagnation. However, in a poll taken in 2006, 61 percent of the people polled viewed the Brezhnev era as good for Russia.|$|E
5|$|Bryan {{believed}} that he could, if nominated, unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging them to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, and speeches. Jones points out that though Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political {{by the standards of}} 1896, by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning for the nomination <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the better-known candidates.|$|E

5|$|Completed in 1916, the Trans-Siberian connects Moscow with Russian Pacific {{seaports}} such as Vladivostok. From the 1960s {{until the}} early 1990s the railway served as the primary land bridge between Asia and Europe, until several factors caused {{the use of the}} railway for transcontinental freight to dwindle. One factor is that the railways of the former Soviet Union use a wider rail gauge <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the rest of Europe as well as China. Recently, however, the Trans-Siberian has regained ground as a viable land route between the two continents.|$|E
5|$|He {{could be}} charming or vulgar, {{ebullient}} or sullen, {{he was given}} to public displays of rage (often contrived) and to soaring hyperbole in his rhetoric. But whatever he was, however he came across, he was more human than his predecessor or even <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his foreign counterparts, and {{for much of the}} world that was enough to make the USSR seem less mysterious or menacing.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century Æthelwulf's {{reputation}} among historians was poor: he {{was seen}} as excessively pious and impractical, and his pilgrimage {{was viewed as a}} desertion of his duties. Historians in the 21st century see him very differently, as a king who consolidated and extended the power of his dynasty, commanded respect on the continent, and dealt more effectively <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his contemporaries with Viking attacks. He is {{regarded as one of the}} most successful West Saxon kings, who laid the foundations for the success of his son, Alfred the Great.|$|E

5000|$|Structurally and thematically, {{the song}} is unusual in many respects. While the {{recorded}} version is 4:03 long, it is composed of only two verses, each with chorus. The piece is also more instrument-driven <b>than</b> <b>most</b> songs <b>of</b> the period, and with a much looser rhyme scheme. Its unusually allusive and referential lyrics are much more complex <b>than</b> <b>most</b> lyrics <b>of</b> the time (for example, the chorus focuses on Chaucer's [...] "The Miller's Tale"). Thus, this piece can be considered an early example of progressive rock.|$|R

5|$|It {{was freed}} of Kotte control in 1467; its {{subsequent}} rulers directed their energies towards consolidating its economic potential by maximising revenue from pearls and elephant exports and land revenue. It was less feudal <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the other regional kingdoms {{on the island}} of Sri Lanka of the same period. During this period, important local Tamil literature was produced and Hindu temples were built including an academy for language advancement.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all members}} of its family, the Pacific swift feeds {{exclusively}} on insects caught in flight. It tends to hunt higher <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> its relatives other than the white-throated needletail. The Pacific swift has a large population and extensive breeding area, and faces few threats from predators or human activities. It is classed as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It has occurred as far afield as the US and New Zealand, {{and it is a}} very rare vagrant in Europe, where it has been recorded in Denmark, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Marcinkus and {{the three}} prisoners in his group posing as Lithuanians– Tim Walenn, Henri Picard and Gordon Brettell– managed to reach a train heading towards Danzig (now Gdansk, Poland). Most likely, they {{intended}} to travel to East Prussia, cross the Lithuanian border, and somehow cross the Baltic Sea to neutral Sweden. However, officials at the Stalag had discovered the escape and began manhunts. Marcinkus and his group travelled further <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the escapees, but were captured by the Gestapo near Schneidemühl on 26 March. Marcinkus and his associates were brought to Stalag XXB and spent the night there. On the following day they were {{handed over to the}} Danzig Gestapo.|$|E

5|$|River {{dolphins}} have conical teeth, used {{to catch}} swift prey such as small river fish. They also have very long snouts, with some measuring , four times longer <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> their oceanic counterparts. They have a two-chambered stomach {{that is similar}} in structure to that of terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers. Breathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, followed by inhaling fresh air into their lungs. They {{do not have the}} iconic spout, as this only forms when the warm air exhaled from the lungs meets cold external air, which does not occur in their tropical habitats.|$|E
5|$|Smalls Paradise had {{no cover}} charge and stayed open longer <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the others, {{including}} the Cotton Club. At Smalls Paradise, patrons could also reserve {{a seat at the}} club by paying a yearly fee. Many regular visitors of Harlem's night clubs also found the food better at Smalls Paradise than at either The Cotton Club or Connie's Inn. While most of the night spots shut their doors between 3 and 4 am, Smalls Paradise began breakfast dances at 6 am with a floor show of up to 30 dancers and a full jazz band.|$|E
5|$|The Catlins—and {{especially}} its {{central and southern}} areas—experiences considerably higher precipitation <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the South Island's east coast; heavy rain occurs infrequently, but drizzle is common and the region averages around 150days of rain per year. Rain days are spread fairly evenly throughout the year; there is no particularly rainy season in the northern Catlins, and only a slight tendency towards more autumn rain in the southwest. The average annual rainfall recorded at the Tautuku Outdoor Education Centre is about , with little variation from year to year.|$|E
