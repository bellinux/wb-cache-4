5|$|The {{issue of}} the double burden is {{exacerbated}} in Asian countries due to the large cultural norm of women doing care work held by both men and women. In many developed countries, women drop out of work when they have children {{in order to have}} more time to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hughes {{insisted on}} using tissues {{to pick up}} objects to {{insulate}} himself from germs. He would also notice dust, stains, or other imperfections on people's clothes and demand that they <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Once {{one of the most}} visible men in America, Hughes ultimately vanished from public view, although tabloids continued to follow rumors of his behavior and whereabouts. He was reported to be terminally ill, mentally unstable, or even dead.|$|E
25|$|In the Fairfax Court House action, the Confederate force {{killed at}} least four of the Union troops and wounded or took {{prisoner}} most of the others. The Confederates suffered a similar number of killed and wounded according to the only report on their casualties by a Union sergeant. Some of the badly wounded Union prisoners were paroled {{at the site of}} the battle along with a few men to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Finding the prisoners from the 11th New York Cavalry and from other Union units to be too much of a burden on the march north, Stuart paroled them at Brookeville, Maryland on the night of June 2829.|$|E

25|$|Anti-lock brakes are {{the subject}} of some {{experiments}} centred around risk compensation theory, which asserts that drivers adapt to the safety benefit of ABS by driving more aggressively. In a Munich study, half a fleet of taxicabs was equipped with anti-lock brakes, while the other half had conventional brake systems. The crash rate was substantially the same for both types of cab, and Wilde concludes this was due to drivers of ABS-equipped cabs taking more risks, assuming that ABS would <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> while the non-ABS drivers drove more carefully since ABS would not be there to help in case of a dangerous situation.|$|E
25|$|As empress, she is {{particularly}} responsible for Momijiyama Imperial Cocoonery, a sericulture farm {{on the grounds}} of the imperial palace. She participates in the annual ceremony of harvesting silk, personally feeds silkworms with blackberries and is responsible to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> the frames, and the harvesting. The production and harvesting of silk are part of her ceremonial duties, linked to Shintoism, Japanese culture, and tradition. Since 1994, the Empress offers a part of the harvested silk of the koishimaru variety (the oldest species now kept in Japan) to the Shōsōin Treasure-house in the Buddhist temple Tōdai-ji in Nara to be used for the restoration of its treasures.|$|E
25|$|Imboden's train {{consisted}} {{of hundreds of}} Conestoga-style wagons, which extended 15–20 miles along the narrow roads. Assembling these wagons into a marching column, arranging their escorts, loading supplies, and accounting for the wounded took until late afternoon on July 5. Imboden himself left Cashtown around 8 p.m. to join {{the head of his}} column. The journey was one of extreme misery, conducted during the torrential rains that began on July 4, in which the wounded men were forced to endure the weather and the rough roads in wagons without suspensions. Imboden's orders required that he not stop until he reached his destination, which meant that wagons breaking down were left behind. Some critically wounded men were left behind on the roadsides as well, hoping that local civilians would find and <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> The train was harassed throughout its march. At dawn on July 5, civilians in Greencastle ambushed the train with axes, attacking the wheels of the wagons, until they were driven off. That afternoon at Cunningham's Cross Roads (current day Cearfoss, Maryland), Capt. Abram Jones led 200 troopers of the 1st New York Cavalry and 12th Pennsylvania Cavalry in attacking the column, capturing 134 wagons, 600 horses and mules, and 645 prisoners, about half of whom were wounded. These losses so angered Stuart that he demanded a court of inquiry to investigate.|$|E

Lisa takes {{gymnastics}} and gets yelled at by the Russian coach for being too old. Bart gets tricked into taking an etiquette class by a black man dressed as a gangsta rapper, who happens to be the husband of the prim and proper etiquette teacher. Homer participates in a basketball class for men over the age of 35, but suffers a torn ACL after a dunk attempt ends with the backboard crashing down on his leg. After Homer gets his surgery, he is told by Dr. Hibbert that he cannot go to work and must stay home. Homer finds himself extremely bored, even going so far as attempting to cross-breed Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II. One evening, Ned wants Marge to watch Rod and Todd while he attends a Chris Rock concert (that he misinterprets to be an abbreviation for a christian rock concert and after is surprised by the language). But Marge is out identifying the body of her Uncle Lou (which ends up being a very much alive Hans Moleman, although the morgue attendant seems convinced that he is dead), so Ned asks Homer instead. Rod and Todd enjoy having Homer <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> which gives Homer the idea to establish his own day care center.|$|E

In the second edition of the book Introducing Cultural Studies, the authors argued that the song contained lyrics about objectification of women, which suggested that their gender role was to [...] "'keep herself up', 'keep it right', 'cater to' their man by providing him with his dinner, a foot rub, a manicure, fetching his slippers, and much more, on demand". An editor writing in The Times of India found a theme of feminine assertiveness in [...] "Cater 2 U"; he noted that [...] "the women come off not so much as lovers as full-service romantic servants". J. Freedom du Lac, a staff writer of The Washington Post wrote that the song's theme was supplication.|$|E
500|$|It {{appears that}} many Romanis {{chose to stay}} in the Basque Country to escape {{persecution}} elsewhere in Europe. Nonetheless, even here they were not safe from persecution. For example, the Royal Council of Navarre in 1602 passed an edict to round up all [...] "vagabonds" [...] (meaning Romani), who were to be condemned to 6 years of galley duty. By the 18th century however attitudes had changed, and the emphasis shifted towards integration.

In [...] "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" [...] (season six, 1995), he {{runs away}} to the dog racing track where he mates with a female hound named She's the Fastest. She later gives birth to 25 puppies and when the Simpsons cannot <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> any longer, they decide to sell them; however, Mr. Burns steals the puppies and decides to make a tuxedo out of them. Before he does this, however, he becomes emotionally touched by them. This convinces him to never wear fur again and instead raise the puppies to be {{world-class}} racing dogs. Santa's Little Helper sires another litter of puppies with Dr. Hibbert's poodle in the episode [...] "Today I Am a Clown" [...] (season 15, 2003). These puppies are given away to townspeople.|$|E
500|$|After {{failing to}} cross a musical and {{colorful}} bridge, the gang falls into a pit where sticky material becomes their zombie-like doppelgangers and moves to chase them. They escape through a Super Mario World-like environment {{and go to the}} house of a toy dog, where they are set up for a trap to eat crumpets with sleeping powder. Mac does not eat the crumpets (since the sleeping powder was thought to be powdered sugar, and he can't eat sugar without temporarily losing his mind) and is able to save the others. As they try to escape, they discover that the heroic man and several others they have met on their journey are all controlled by a single face—World—who can animate and control seemingly anything he latches onto. World is trapped on an apple and the gang leaves it at a desert; but latches on a horse, truly the guise of Mac and the gang rides by, and World is able to move once more. It gallops off to the castle, where the gang find Frankie and attempt to save her. However, Frankie reveals that World never kidnapped her, she was staying of her own free will and is happy to be away from the work at Foster's and Mr. Herriman's constant nagging. The friends then plead with Frankie to come home insisting that they need her to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> She believes their pleas to be selfish and storms off as she is [...] "sick of taking care of everyone and everything without never even receiving a word of thanks, an ounce of help, or a tiny little smidgen of respect".
