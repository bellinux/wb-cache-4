50|$|Males {{establish}} a territory {{on a rock}} or coral surface and start clean it. Then, the male will court a female to the territory. Females then lay their eggs and the males fertilize them. After that, the male will constantly guard the eggs until they hatch. The eggs also get aerated and tended for by the male. Eggs that failed <b>to</b> <b>hatch</b> are removed <b>out</b> of the spawning site. The reproduction process usually lasts for about 20 minutes. Females can lay up to 20,000 eggs each. On average, eggs take about 3 days to a week <b>to</b> <b>hatch.</b> Males sometimes spawn with more than 1 female.|$|R

This technique has been shown to increase implantation and pregnancy rates in women of advanced age, in women with recurrent implantation failure and following the transfer of frozen–thawed embryos.

40|$|This essay {{examines}} the process undergone in the Canterbury province {{in the late}} 1860 s and early 1870 s to import Salmo trutta (brown trout) ova from Tasmania, <b>to</b> <b>hatch</b> them <b>out</b> and <b>to</b> distribute them throughout the waterways of the province. This essay seeks to answer two questions. First, how were trout introduced? Second, why was their introduction of such significance to colonists at the time? To answer these questions this essay draws upon a comprehensive range of primary sources including Society records and newspapers. The successful importation of trout represented {{one of the key}} early achievements of the fledgling Canterbury Acclimatisation Society at a time when several other attempted introductions were failing. The process undertaken to import the ova, rear hatchlings and distribute the �young trout� tested the scientific knowledge of the 1860 s and 1870 s. It necessitated significant interaction with international acclimatisation groups primarily in Australia but also further afield. This essay also attempts to convey the significance of the importation to Canterbury. Such was the public interest that the coverage of trout in print media extended <b>to</b> the <b>hatching</b> of individual ova or the sighting of escaped trout. Trout were afforded a romanticised status in colonial New Zealand society, {{largely as a result of}} their construction as a quintessentially British object. Their importation was motivated by several factors, namely the re-creation of a British ecology in New Zealand, the recreational opportunities they afforded and the food source they provided...|$|R

60|$|After breakfast, Mrs Keswick {{proved the}} truth of what her niece had said about her unscrupulous straightforwardness when {{carrying}} out her projects. She had invited Mr Croft and Miss March to her house in order that the former might have the opportunity which she had discovered he wanted and could not get, of offering himself in marriage to the lady; and she now made it her business to see that Mr Croft's opportunity should stand up very clear and definite before him; and that all interfering circumstances should be carefully removed. She informed her niece that she wished her to go with her to a thicket {{on the other side of}} the wheat field which that young lady had advised should be ploughed for pickles, to look for a turkey-hen which she had reason to believe had been ridiculous enough <b>to</b> <b>hatch</b> <b>out</b> a brood of young at this improper season. Annie demurred, for she did not want to go to look for turkeys, nor did she want to give Mr Croft any opportunities; but the old lady insisted, and carried her off. Croft felt that there was something very bare and raw-boned about the position in which he was left with Miss March; and he thought that lady might readily suppose that Mrs Keswick's object was to leave them together. He imagined that, himself, though why she should be so kind to him he could not feel quite certain. However, his path lay straight before him, and if the, old lady had whitewashed it to make it more distinct, he did not intend to refuse to walk in it.|$|E
6000|$|I wish here to {{make some}} mention of Euphemia's methods of work in her chicken-yard. She kept a book, which she at first called her [...] "Fowl Record," [...] but she {{afterward}} changed the name to [...] "Poultry Register." [...] I never could thoroughly understand this book, although she has often explained every part of it to me. She had pages for registering the age, description, time of purchase or of birth, and subsequent performances of every fowl in her yard. She had divisions of the book for expenses, profits, probable losses and positive losses; she noted the number of eggs put under each setting hen; the number of eggs cracked per day, the number spoiled, and finally, the number hatched. Each chick, on emerging from its shell, was registered, and an account kept of its subsequent life and adventures. There were frequent calculations regarding the advantages of various methods of treatment, and there were statements {{of the results of}} a great many experiments--something like this: [...] "Set Toppy and her sister Pinky, April 2nd 187-; Toppy with twelve eggs,--three Brahma, four common, and five Leghorn; Pinky with thirteen eggs (as she weighs four ounces more than her sister), of which three were Leghorn, five common, and five Brahma. During the twenty-second and twenty-third of April (same year) Toppy hatched out four Brahmas, two commons, and three Leghorns, while her sister, on these days and the morning of the day following, hatched two Leghorns, six commons, and only one Brahma. Now, could Toppy, who had only three Brahma eggs, and hatched out four of that breed, have exchanged eggs with her sister, thus making it possible for her <b>to</b> <b>hatch</b> <b>out</b> six common chickens, when she only had five eggs of that kind? Or, did the eggs get mixed up in some way before going into the possession of the hens? Look into probabilities." ...|$|E
60|$|I have (said Reginald) an aunt who worries. She's {{not really}} an aunt--a sort of amateur one, and they aren't really worries. She is a social success, and has no {{domestic}} tragedies worth speaking of, so she adopts any decorative sorrows that are going, myself included. In that way she's the antithesis, or whatever you call it, to those sweet, uncomplaining women one knows who have seen trouble, and worn blinkers ever since. Of course, one just loves them for it, but I must confess they make me uncomfy; they remind one so of a duck that goes flapping about with forced cheerfulness long after its head's been cut off. Ducks have no repose. Now, my aunt has a shade of hair that suits her, and a cook who quarrels with the other servants, which is always a hopeful sign, and a conscience that's absentee for about eleven months of the year, and only turns up at Lent to annoy her husband's people, who are considerably Lower than the angels, so to speak: with all these natural advantages--she says her particular tint of bronze is a natural advantage, and {{there can be no}} two opinions as to the advantage--of course she has to send out for her afflictions, like those restaurants where they haven't got a licence. The system has this advantage, that you can fit your unhappinesses in with your other engagements, whereas real worries have a way of arriving at meal-times, and when you're dressing, or other solemn moments. I knew a canary once that had been trying for months and years <b>to</b> <b>hatch</b> <b>out</b> a family, and everyone looked upon it as a blameless infatuation, like the sale of Delagoa Bay, which would be an annual loss to the Press agencies if it ever came to pass; and one day the bird really did bring it off, in the middle of family prayers. I say the middle, but it was also the end: you can't go on being thankful for daily bread when you are wondering what on earth very new canaries expect to be fed on.|$|E

60|$|Some few fish, indeed, {{are truly}} viviparous; among them certain {{blennies}} and carps, {{in which the}} eggs <b>hatch</b> <b>out</b> entirely within {{the body of the}} mother. One of the most interesting of these divergent types is the common Californian and Mexican silver-fish, an inhabitant of the bays and inlets of sub-tropical America. Its chief peculiarity and title to fame lies in the extreme bigness of its young at birth. The full-grown fish runs to about ten inches in length, fisherman's scale, while the fry measure as much as three inches apiece; so that they lie, as Professor Seeley somewhat forcibly expresses it, 'packed {{in the body of the}} parent as close as herrings in a barrel.' This strange habit of retaining the eggs till after they have <b>hatched</b> <b>out</b> is not peculiar to fish among egg-laying animals, for the common little brown English lizard is similarly viviparous, though most of its relatives elsewhere deposit their eggs <b>to</b> be <b>hatched</b> by the heat of the sun in earth or sandbanks.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the parasite can vary greatly depending on the conditions, namely temperature and humidity.

50|$|Diagnosis {{depends on}} finding {{characteristic}} worm eggs on microscopic {{examination of the}} stools, although this is not possible in early infection. Early signs of infection in most dogs include limbular limping and anal itching. The eggs are oval or elliptical, measuring 60 µm by 40 µm, colorless, not bile stained and with a thin transparent hyaline shell membrane. When released by the worm in the intestine, the egg contains an unsegmented ovum. During its passage down the intestine, the ovum develops and thus the eggs passed in feces have a segmented ovum, usually with 4 to 8 blastomeres.As the eggs of both Ancylostoma and Necator (and most other hookworm species) are indistinguishable, to identify the genus, they must be cultured in the lab to allow larvae <b>to</b> <b>hatch</b> <b>out.</b> If the fecal sample is left {{for a day or}} more under tropical conditions, the larvae will have hatched out, so eggs might no longer be evident.
