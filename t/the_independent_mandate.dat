50|$|After {{retiring}} from politics, Rouble {{was appointed by}} Premier Pasloski as the Chair of the Yukon Land Use Planning Council, the body under the Yukon's Umbrella Final Agreement responsible for making recommendations to the Yukon Government on land use planning. The appointment drew disdain from the opposition and the media, since as Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, Rouble had worked to undermine {{the recommendations of the}} Council's Peel Watershed Commission after six years of public consultations. There was concern that Rouble prejudiced <b>the</b> <b>independent</b> <b>mandate</b> of the Council and could weaken government relations with First Nations. Both the Yukon News and members of the opposition called upon Rouble to recuse himself of the appointment, which he did not. The process surrounding the Peel Watershed Commission eventually led to a legal challenge at the Supreme Court of Canada in 2017.|$|E
40|$|The {{interventions}} done by {{central banks}} in order either to provide liquidity or {{to help the}} recovery of economic growth, during the lasting effects of the recent financial crisis, have again brought into the light the question how the monetary policy is serving the best a sustainable growth. Beyond {{the fact that in}} Europe, especially within the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), we still stack on <b>the</b> <b>independent</b> <b>mandate</b> of price stability connected with that of the financial stability, there still exists the propensity to think in a different way the contribution of a central bank to the stated issue through its monetary policy conduct. I think that we cannot compare National Bank of Romania`s mandate with those of FED or other central banks issuing international reserve currency, but we also cannot totally neglect that between the monetary policy effects and the economic growth there is a link. The difference is that many believe that this has to be on purpose, e. g. the central banks instruments are ex ante calibrated for economic growth, while a correct approach is that the monetary policy conduct responding primarily to price stability is creating ex post the potential for a sustainable growth. Accepting that, we can start from financial stability to explain better how the monetary policy has a role in economic growth by not diluting the mandate and the independence of the central bank...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three self-contained essays on corporate boards of directors. In the first essay, I {{examine the effect of}} overconfident CEO directors on corporate innovation and find that such directors are significantly associated with not only greater innovation input as measured by R&D intensity, but also better innovation output as measured by the number of successful patents and the number of patent citations. I further find that such directors are also associated with increased firm performance. Thus, this essay sheds new light on the puzzle of why firms are willing to appoint CEO directors despite their non-positive impacts on board monitoring and provides an answer from the perspective of board advising: overconfident CEO directors provide advice and counsel to the CEOs which are valuable for corporate innovation. In the second essay, I investigate <b>the</b> implication of <b>independent</b> directors’ multi-industry experience (IDMIE) for firm value. I find that a higher degree of IDMIE is consistently and robustly related to a higher firm value. I further examine channels through which IDMIE can potentially affect firm value. I find that IDMIE has a positive effect on corporate innovation. A higher degree of IDMIE increases a firm’s R&D intensity, the number of patents, and the citation of the patents. Overall, the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that IDMIE enhances independent directors’ ability to perform their duties, and therefore provides important policy implications for the design of corporate boards. In the third essay, I use <b>the</b> <b>independent</b> board requirements <b>mandated</b> by new NYSE and NASDAQ listing rules following Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) as an exogenous shock to estimate how board independence affects the variability of firm performance. Using a difference-in-difference approach, I find that treatment firms observe larger decrease in the variability of firm performance after SOX than control firms. The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the increased independence weakens the CEO power over the board and thus decisions made by a more independent board are less extreme, resulting in less variability of firm performance...|$|R

40|$|The Minutes of the Center Directors’ Meeting of May 1987 {{summarize}} the center directors {{approach to the}} CD meeting with co-sponsors {{and the results of}} that meeting. Issues discussed ranged from initiating a process of holding periodic meetings with co-sponsors to discuss strategic issues such as the direction and the vision of the CG, its non-political and non-governmental nature, alternative sources of funding, conflict of interest guidelines with respect to TAC appointments and emphasis on appointing members with the highest scientific credentials. At this meeting Center Directors indicate their preference that the CG Chair be {{a vice president of the}} World Bank. The minutes reflect center directors concerns about the potential for conflict between system-wide demands and the capacity of centers to pursue their <b>independent</b> <b>mandates,</b> growth of <b>the</b> system without growth in funding and a decision to establish an Executive Committee of CDs to represent them on specific occasions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Poor diets are {{a leading}} cause of disease burden worldwide. In Australia, the Federal Government {{established}} the Food and Health Dialogue (the Dialogue) in 2009 to address this issue, primarily through food reformulation. We evaluated the Dialogue’s performance over its 6 years of operation and used these findings to develop recommendations for the success of the new Healthy Food Partnership. Methods We used information from the Dialogue website, media releases, communiqués, e-newsletters, materials released under freedom-of-information, and Parliamentary Hansard to evaluate the Dialogue’s achievements from October 2013 to November 2015, using the RE-AIM (reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation and maintenance) framework. We also engaged closely with two former Dialogue members. Our findings update a prior assessment done in October 2013. Results Little data is available to evaluate the Dialogue’s recent achievements, with no information about progress against milestones released since October 2013. In the last 2 years, only one additional set of sodium reduction targets (cheese) was agreed and Quick Service Restaurant foods were added as an area for action. Some activity was identified in 12 of a possible 137 (9  %) areas of action within <b>the</b> Dialogue’s <b>mandate.</b> <b>Independent</b> evaluation found targets were partially achieved in some food categories, with substantial variation in success between companies. No effects on the knowledge, behaviours or nutrient intake of the Australian population or evidence of impact on diet-related disease could be identified. Conclusions The new Healthy Food Partnership has similar goals to the Dialogue. While highly laudable and recognised globally as cost-effective, the mechanism for delivery in Australia has been woefully inadequate. Strong government leadership, adequate funding, clear targets and timelines, management of conflict of interest, comprehensive monitoring and evaluation, and a plan for responsive regulation in the event of missed milestones will be required if the new Healthy Food Partnership is to achieve its urgent public health goals...|$|R
