This explains why so many tubular defects coexist in this disease, and particularly a distal tubular acidification defect of which the highly prevalent metabolic bone disease is one very important consequence. In addition to the typical clinical phenotype of recurrent stone disease, other clinical profiles have now been recognized, that is, an indolent, almost asymptomatic MSK, and a rare form characterized by intractable, excruciating pain. It was previously believed that most cases of Medullary Sponge Kidney were sporadic however, recent studies show familial clustering of MSK is common and has an autosomal dominant inheritance, a reduced penetrance, and variable expressivity.

40|$|In {{his famous}} work On the Natural Faculties, Galen of Pergamum {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} “attraction” [δλκηζ] as the principal mode of kidney function: the attraction of blood to the kidney, he claimed, results {{in the production of}} urine [1]. Though unproven in Galen's ancient times and entirely rejected by the later generations as a mechanistic explanation of renal function, the concept of attraction has not only survived, albeit in a modified form, but {{has become one of the}} cornerstone principles of modern physiology and our current understanding of the pathophysiology of processes as diverse as platelet aggregation, metastases, immune recognition and wound healing, to name a few, all of which are governed by adhesion molecules. Here we review the role of adhesion molecules in the pathophysiology of <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction,</b> focusing on the integrins and their newly recognized function in it. The importance of renal <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> in the pathogenesis of acute renal failure (ARF) was brought to center stage by a series of elegant microdissection studies by Oliver, MacDowell and Tracy [2]. Using servo-null pressure monitoring of the proximal tubular pressure in diverse models of ARF, investigators have provided solid evidence for the elevation in hydrostatic intratubular pressure concomitant with the unchanged stop-flow and estimated glomerular capillary pressures, further confirming the tubulo-obstructive component of this syndrome [3 – 5]. It has been concluded, therefore, that <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> and elevated proximal tubular pressure equilibrate glomerular filtration pressure, thus leading to the persisting oliguria. Necrotic epithelial cells have been postulated to provide the matrix for casts obstructing the tubular lumen. Recent findings of viable epithelial cells in the urine of patients and experimental animals with ARF, however, cast doubt on the postulated schema and suggest the possibility of epithelial cell detachment as an important contributor to the development of <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> [6 – 8]. In the following discussion we develop this theme, providing data on the possible mechanism(s) of <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> in ischemic ARF, and on the therapeutic strategies in and benefits of inhibiting <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction,</b> and suggest some future directions of this fledgling field of investigations...|$|E
40|$|Ischaemic-reperfusion injury as a {{model of}} acute renal failure (ARF) results in {{increased}} macromolecular permeability, <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction,</b> and renal oedema. To investigate the role for coagulation in this model, anticoagulated and saline-pretreated rats were subjected to 60 [*]min unilateral renal artery occlusion (RAO). After 15 [*]min of reflow, specimens were collected for electron and light microscopic examination. Morphometry was employed to study podocyte changes and Bowman's space dilatation as measures of increased permeability and <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction,</b> respectively. After 15 [*]min of reflow, Bowman's space increased significantly and the podocytes were markedly widened and flattened. Rats pretreated with heparin or warfarin showed less widening of Bowman's space than saline-treated rats, whereas no significant difference was seen regarding the podocyte changes. In saline-treated rats, fibrin-positive material was seen in the tubules but not in the urine sediments collected after 90 [*]min of reflow, either due to fibrinolysis or poor urinary elimination. The results suggest that anticoagulation does not preclude the glomerular sieving of macromolecules, but seems to reduce <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction,</b> probably by preventing conversion of filtered fibrinogen into fibrin...|$|E
40|$|Neutrophil-mediated post-ischemic tubular leakage in the rat kidney. Neutropenia was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by {{administration}} of antineutrophil serum (ANS). A control group received an equal volume of inactive serum. After 45 minutes of unilateral complete renal ischemia the {{renal blood flow}} (RBF) was measured by an electromagnetic flow meter. The net filtration force (NFF) in glomerular capillaries, single nephron filtration rate (SNGFR) and frequency of <b>tubular</b> <b>obstructions</b> were estimated by a micropuncture technique. Tubular leakage was measured from the fractional recovery in the normal contralateral kidney of 3 H- or 14 C-inulin injected into surface proximal and distal tubules of the post-ischemic kidney. Neither ANS nor inactive serum had any influence on inulin clearance (CIn) in the normal kidney. In the post-ischemic kidney, CIn was four times higher in ANS-treated than in control animals. There {{was no difference in}} RBF, NFF, SNGFR or the frequency of <b>tubular</b> <b>obstructions</b> between neutrophil-depleted and control animals. The transtubular leakage of inulin injected into proximal tubules was substantially less in the ANS-treated than in the control group (11. 3 ± 1. 5 % vs. 35. 1 ± 6. 5 %; P < 0. 01). But distal tubular leakage was equal in the two groups. The control group showed isosthenuria (350 ± 29 mOsm · kg- 1), while ANS-treated animals produced hyperosmolar urine (555 ± 60 mOsm · kg- 1; P < 0. 05). It is concluded that neutrophil granulocytes mediate post-ischemic tubular leakage, which contributes to the depression in renal clearance parameters and the inability to produce hyperosmolar urine...|$|R
40|$|Nephron {{function}} in the early phase of ischemic renal failure. Significance of erythrocyte trapping. Trapping of red blood cells (RBCs) in renal medulla vasculature in postischemic acute renal failure (ARF) was found to depend upon {{the length of the}} ischemic period. Thus trapping occurred after 45 minutes but not 25 minutes of ischemia. By prior hemodilution to a hematocrit (hct) of 30 %, RBC trapping after 45 minutes of ischemia could be completely prevented. Likewise hemo-concentration (hct = 60 %) before 25 minutes of ischemia resulted in extensive RBC trapping. By increasing or decreasing the hct, the contribution of RBC trapping to the functional defects and decrease in renal blood flow that follows minor (25 min) and more substantial (45 min) ischemia was investigated. Renal blood flow (RBF) was measured by microspheres, and vascular and tubular pressure by the micropuncture technique. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated from inulin clearance, and tubular function from urine osmolality and sodium and potassium excretion. It was found that postischemic RBF was not correlated to RBC trapping but depended on the length of ischemia. After both 25 and 45 minutes of ischemia <b>tubular</b> <b>obstructions</b> occurred in the proximal tubules and/or loops of Henle, causing an increase in proximal <b>tubular</b> pressure. These <b>obstructions</b> were dependent on the length of ischemia but not on RBC trapping. After hemoconcentration and 25 minutes of ischemia there was an increment in distal tubular pressure, indicating that abundant RBC trapping may contribute to an increase in tubular pressure by compression of medullary tubules and thereby reduce GFR. When the damage was more severe, other factors came into play and the contribution of RBC trapping to the decrease in GFR was minimal. Thus a beneficial effect of hemodilution on 45 minutes of ischemia could not be established. Concerning tubular function, isosthenuria and potassium and sodium excretion were not dependent on RBC trapping. It is concluded that RBC trapping in the early phase of ARF has minimal influence on GFR and tubular function. Thus, standard markers of kidney function do not reflect the degree of RBC trapping...|$|R

Despite rigorous patient monitoring, nephrotoxicity appears in 10 – 25 % of therapeutic courses. Traditionally, aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity has been considered to result mainly from tubular damage.

Cisplatin inhibited SHP protein {{expression in the}} kidney of cisplatin-treated mice and human proximal tubular (HK 2) cells; this effect was counteracted by FXR ligand. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed the presence of <b>tubular</b> casts, <b>obstructions</b> and dilatations in cisplatin-induced kidney injury, which was attenuated by FXR ligand. FXR ligand also attenuated protein expression of transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1), Smad signaling, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process, inflammatory markers and cytokines, and apoptotic markers in cisplatin-treated mice. Cisplatin induced NF-κB activation in HK 2 cell; this effect was attenuated by pretreatment with FXR ligand. In SHP knockdown by small interfering RNA, cisplatin-induced activation of TGF-β 1, p-JNK and Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio was not attenuated, while SHP overexpression and FXR ligand inhibited expression of these proteins in cisplatin-pretreated HK 2 cells.

40|$|The use of 131 I-orthiodohippurate (OIH) {{scintigraphy}} {{combined with}} the estimated renal plasma flow (ERPF) and excretion index (EI) has been beneficial in separating impaired renal function due to graft rejection from acute <b>tubular</b> necrosis, ureteral <b>obstruction,</b> urinary extravasation {{and in some instances}} renal artery occlusion. The radionuclide data accurately identified acute and chronic rejection, confirmed by the clinical course, increase in BUN and serum creatinine and on occasion renal biopsy. Reversible and irreversible acute tubular necrosis (ATN) were clearly differentiated from acute rejection. When the ERPF and EI were plotted on a graph, multiple sequential radionuclide studies accurately predicted graft survival when chronic rejection existed. The limitation of this technique was the inability to discriminate between renal artery stenosis, ureteral obstruction and inflammatory disease. Scintigraphic studies did not distinguish between renal artery stenosis and chronic rejection. In these circumstances arteriography was the diagnostic procedure of choice. Although ureteral obstruction often can be correctly diagnosed by scintigrams, the ERPF, EI and intravenous pyelogram remained the most accurate diagnostic procedures. Recurrent glomerulonephritis, gram negative septicemia and generalized viral illness (herpes zoster or cytomegalovirus) simulated acute rejection and had to be separated by renal biopsy or the clinical course.

40|$|Acute {{worsening}} of renal function during {{episodes of}} macroscopic hematuria in IgA nephropathy. The appearance of renal failure during episodes of macroscopic hematuria (EMH) in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) {{has been described}} as very unusual. The results of a prospective investigation on the effect of EMH on renal function in IgAN are presented. During a 3 -year period, 29 episodes of EMH occurring in 21 patients with IgAN have been studied. A derangement of renal function (increase of serum creatinine by more than 0. 5 mg/dl) was observed in 11 episodes (37. 9 %) with peak creatinine values ranging from 1. 2 to 6. 7 mg/dl. The worsening of renal function was accompanied by a longer duration of EMH (4. 8 ± 1. 3 vs. 3. 5 ± 1. 5 days; P < 0. 05) but not by arterial hypertension or edema. A complete recovery of renal function was observed in every patient 1 to 2 months after the start of EMH. The histological survey disclosed that the decrease of renal function correlated closely with the presence of red blood cell casts in as much as 50 % of the tubular lumen and with findings of tubular necrosis. We conclude that a worsening of renal function can be observed frequently during the EMH. <b>Tubular</b> damage and <b>obstruction</b> by red blood cell casts may {{play a significant role in}} the pathogenesis of this complication...|$|R

After the intravenous injection of methemoglobin, 0. 5 to 1. 0 g/kg body weight, the animals became oliguric but not anuric.

40|$|Reorientation of {{the alpha}} 3 subunit of integrins from {{predominantly}} basal to the apical cell surface of cultured renal tubular epithelial cells subjected to oxidant stress {{has previously been}} demonstrated. The present {{study was designed to}} assess functional competence of ectopically expressed apical integrins. Cell-cell adhesion assay revealed enhanced cytoatractant properties of stressed cells. Stressed epithelial cells exhibited specific recognition and binding of laminin-coated latex beads. These processes were inhibited with the peptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Asn-Pro (GRGDNP) suggesting a role of RGD-recognizing integrins in augmented adhesion to stressed cells. Given that such enhanced adhesion in in vivo acute renal failure may govern <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> by desquamated epithelium, a physiological marker of patency of tubular lumen, proximal tubular pressure, was monitored in rats subjected to 60 min of renal ischemia followed by reperfusion. Proximal tubular pressure increased 2 -fold after 2 hr of reperfusion in animals that had undergone 60 min of ischemia. Infusion of GRGDNP into the renal artery during reperfusion period virtually abolished an increase in proximal tubular pressure observed in ischemic acute renal failure. These in vitro and in vivo findings are consistent with the hypothesis that RGD-recognizing integrins {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> in ischemic acute renal failure...|$|E
40|$|NADPH oxidases {{synthesize}} reactive {{oxygen species}} that may participate in fibrosis progression. NOX 4 and NOX 2 are NADPH oxidases expressed in the kidneys, with the former being the major renal isoform, but their contribution to renal disease is not well understood. Here, we used the unilateral urinary obstruction model of chronic renal injury to decipher the role of these enzymes using wild-type, NOX 4 -, NOX 2 -, and NOX 4 /NOX 2 -deficient mice. Compared with wild-type mice, NOX 4 -deficient mice exhibited more interstitial fibrosis and <b>tubular</b> apoptosis after <b>obstruction,</b> with lower interstitial capillary density and reduced expression of hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α and vascular endothelial growth factor in obstructed kidneys. Furthermore, NOX 4 -deficient kidneys exhibited increased oxidative stress. With NOX 4 deficiency, renal expression of other NOX isoforms was not altered but NRF 2 protein expression was reduced under both basal and obstructed conditions. Concomitant deficiency of NOX 2 did not modify the phenotype exhibited by NOX 4 -deficient mice after obstruction. NOX 4 silencing in a mouse collecting duct (mCCD(cl 1)) cell line increased TGF-β 1 -induced apoptosis and decreased NRF 2 protein along with expression of its target genes. In addition, NOX 4 silencing decreased hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α and expression of its target genes in response to hypoxia. In summary, these results demonstrate {{that the absence of}} NOX 4 promotes kidney fibrosis, independent of NOX 2, through enhanced tubular cell apoptosis, decreased microvascularization, and enhanced oxidative stress. Thus, NOX 4 is crucial for the survival of kidney tubular cells under injurious conditions...|$|R

The patient was dialyzed for 10 days and responded to steroids and went home with an improving Cr of 3. 5 mg/dL, back to baseline of 1. 5 in 8 weeks. Discussion. Internists encounter patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) on a daily basis, most {{of which can be}} explained by prerenal azotemia, acute <b>tubular</b> necrosis (ATN), <b>obstruction,</b> or rhabdomyolysis among other etiologies. Cocaine is only rarely implicated as an etiology of AKI and if it is, usually the injury is due to ATN or pigment effects. Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) caused by cocaine, on the other hand, has only been described in a handful of cases. AIN is a renal lesion that causes a decline in creatinine clearance and is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate in the kidney interstitium and is most often associated with drug therapy. AIN can also be seen in autoimmune disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome, or sarcoidosis; or with infections remote to the kidney like Legionella, leptospirosis, and streptococcal disease. Our case was very similar to the other reported cases of AIN due to cocaine in that all have occurred in middle-aged African American males and all have responded to steroids.

Renal <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> is an important contributor to the pathophysiology of {{acute renal failure}}. Based on the previous findings of {{the role played by}} arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) recognizing integrins in <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction,</b> this study examined the effect of RGD peptides on the course of ischemic acute renal failure in rats. For in vivo studies, animals were subjected to 45 minutes of unilateral renal ischemia with contralateral nephrectomy, and cyclic RGD peptides or a linear biotinylated RGD peptide were injected systemically after the release of renal artery clamp. In vitro studies compared the potency of the peptides in inhibiting BS-C- 1 cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion. Two novel cyclic RGD peptides utilized in these studies showed different inhibitory potency in preventing cell-matrix adhesion: cyclic RGDDFV was a highly potent in vitro inhibitor of BS-C- 1 cell-matrix adhesion, whereas cyclic RGDDFLG was less potent. In cell-cell adhesion assays, however, both peptides were equipotent. Despite the differences in inhibiting cell-matrix adhesion, a single systemic administration of either peptide improved creatinine clearance postoperatively and accelerated recovery of renal function with a rank order: cyclic RGDDFV ≥ RGDDFLG > RDADFV (inactive control). These findings represent the first in vivo demonstration of the effectiveness of cyclic RGD peptides in ameliorating ischemic acute renal failure, and suggest that in this setting RGD peptides predominantly inhibit cell-cell adhesion, whereas inhibition of cell-matrix adhesion is of lesser significance...|$|E

Furosemide has been widely prescribed to maintain or increase urine output for both the risk and treatment of AKI, because it {{may be needed to}} maintain patency of renal tubules and prevent <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> and back-leak.

All together, this gives rise to the decrease in GFR and urine output which is the clinical hallmarks of AKI [23].

We postulated that if NO/ONOO- has an effect to reduce cell adhesion to the basement membrane, this may contribute to <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> and may be partially responsible for the harmful effect of NO on the tubular epithelium during acute renal failure (ARF). MethodsWe examined {{the effect of the}} NO donors (z) - 1 -[2 -(2 -aminoethyl) -N-(2 -ammonioethyl) amino]diazen- 1 -ium- 1, 2 -diolate (DETA/NO), spermine NONOate (SpNO), and the ONOO- donor 3 -morpholinosydnonimine (SIN- 1) on cell-matrix adhesion to collagen types I and IV and fibronectin using three renal tubular epithelial cell lines: LLC-PK 1, BSC- 1, and OK. ResultsIn LLC-PK 1 cells, DETA/NO (500 μm) had no effect, and SpNO (500 μm) had a modest effect on cell adhesion compared with controls. Exposure to SIN- 1 caused a dose-dependent impairment in cell-matrix adhesion. Similar results were obtained in the different cell types and matrix proteins. The effect of SIN- 1 (500 μm) on LLC-PK 1 cell adhesion was not associated with either cell death or alteration of matrix protein and was attenuated by either the NO scavenger 2 -(4 -carboxyphenyl) - 4, 4, 5, 5 -tetramethylimidazoline- 1 -oxyl- 3 -oxide, the superoxide scavenger superoxide dismutase, or the ONOO- scavenger uric acid in a dose-dependent manner. ConclusionsThese results therefore support the possibility that ONOO- generated in the tubular epithelium during ischemia/reperfusion has the potential to impair the adhesion properties of tubular cells, which then may contribute to the <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> in ARF...|$|E

Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor used {{as an alternative to}} warfarin for long term anticoagulation. Warfarin-related nephropathy is an increasingly recognized entity, but recent evidence suggests that dabigatran can cause a WRN-like syndrome. We describe a case of a biopsy-proven anticoagulant nephropathy related to dabigatran in a patient with IgA nephropathy and propose that, despite the base glomerular disease, acute kidney injury was due to <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> by red blood cells and heme-associated tubular injury, and through a mechanism involving inhibition of anticoagulation cascade and barrier abnormalities caused by molecular mechanisms. 1...|$|E
40|$|Two novel probes reveal tubular and {{vascular}} Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) binding {{sites in}} the ischemic rat kidney. We have previously demonstrated that RGD peptides prevent <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> in ischemic acute renal failure (ARF) and suggested that exposed unoccupied integrin receptors represent the target for such therapy. The present study investigated the topography of RGD binding sites and integrin receptors in ischemic rat kidneys. Two RGD peptides were synthesized: a cyclic biotinylated (Bt) RGD peptide and a linear RGD peptide (GRGDSP) labeled with rhodamine green (RhoG). Rats were subjected to 45 minutes of renal artery occlusion, kidneys were harvested at different times post-ischemia, and stained with RGD peptides and a panel of antibodies to integrins. In control, Bt-RGD staining was undetectable in alkaline phosphatase histochemistry, whereas immunofluorescence detection with Rho-strepta-vidin conjugate as well as RhoG-GRGDSP staining faintly decorated the basolateral aspect of the proximal tubular cells in a punctate fashion. In contrast, ischemic kidneys showed binding to the basolateral and apical aspects of proximal tubules, peritubular capillaries, and desquamated cells within tubular lumen. The most conspicuous staining of ischemic kidneys was obtained with antibodies to the β 1 (labeling of the apical aspect of proximal and distal tubules, as well as desquamated cells obstructing tubular lumen) and the αV (glomeruli, tubular epithelia, intima of blood vessels stained faintly, while the obstructing cellular conglomerates showed intense staining) subunits. Double staining with Bt-RGD and antibodies against the β 1 and αVβ 3 integrins showed co-localization of staining within the tubules and vasculature, respectively. In vitro attachment of HL- 60 leukocytes to the endothelial cells was inhibited by the cyclic RGD peptide. In conclusion, expression of RGD binding sites and β 1 integrin subunits along the apical aspect of tubular epithelia and {{on the surface of}} desquamated cells is in concert with the hypothesis on the pathogenetic role of RGD-recognizing integrins in <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction.</b> The expression of RGD binding sites along the intimal surface of blood vessels in ischemic kidneys suggests an additional target for RGD peptides in vascular endothelial cells...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The {{objective}} {{is to determine the}} clinical and experimental evidences of the renal responses to warm and cold ischemia, kidney tolerability, and available practical techniques of protecting the kidney during nephron-sparing surgery. Materials and methods. Review of the English and non-English literature using MEDLINE, MD Consult, and urology textbooks. Results and discussion. There are three main mechanisms of ischemic renal injury, including persistent vasoconstriction with an abnormal endothelial cell compensatory response, <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> with backflow of urine, and reperfusion injury. Controversy persists on the maximal kidney tolerability to warm ischemia (WI), which can be influenced by surgical technique, patient age, presence of collateral vascularization, indemnity of the arterial bed, and so forth. Conclusions. When WI time is expected to exceed from 20 to 30 minutes, especially in patients whose baseline medical characteristics put them at potentially higher, though unproven, risks of ischemic damage, local renal hypothermia should be used...|$|E
30|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI {{is believed}} to be triggered predominantly by myoglobin, which may cause renal dysfunction by direct renal cytotoxicity after reaching the tubules [4], vasoconstriction and <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> [1, 5]. CK is the marker most commonly used to guide the diagnosis and therapy in daily clinical practice. Its half-life is 1.5  days [3]. In contrast, myoglobin is cleared much more quickly (half-life 2 – 3  hours), and clearance also occurs outside of the kidney [1]. The CK level that is associated with an increased risk of AKI has not been pinpointed, but values up to 5, 000 U/L have been reported to increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI [6], especially when acidosis is present concomitantly [2, 7]. Because most rhabdomyolysis studies are retrospective and involve small sample sizes, the exact role of myoglobin in the progression of the condition and the levels that lead to renal toxicity in rhabdomyolysis are still unclear [1, 8 – 10].|$|E
40|$|Tubulo-interstitial lesions mediate renal {{damage in}} {{adriamycin}} glomerulopathy. The {{present study was}} designed to investigate the relationship between proteinuria, focal sclerosis, and tubulo-interstitial changes in the evolution of renal damage in experimental nephrosis. We utilized an accelerated unilateral model of adriamycin (ADR) nephrosis characterized by morphological changes more severe than in the classical model. The first events in ADR-induced glomerulopathy were epithelial cell damage and proteinuria. Subsequently, tubular casts were formed at the distal level. The cast formation preceded the development of interstitial damage, which was determined by <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> and breaking of tubular basement membrane (TBM), which in turn promoted an interstitial inflammatory reaction. Despite the severity of tubulo-interstitial damage observed after a long period of heavy proteinuria, the incidence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSG) was very low. The {{results of the present study}} indicate that chronic proteinuria is not necessarily accompanied by the development of focal sclerosis Tubulo-interstitial lesions appear to be the most important determinant for the progression of renal damage in this model...|$|E
40|$|The minimal or {{depression}} renal threshold for dog hemoglobin is not modified by moderate doses of mercuric chloride. This type of renal injury involves the epithelium of the convoluted tubules but the glomeruli escape. We {{are unable to}} explain our findings {{if we assume that}} the tubular epithelium takes an active part in the passage of dog hemoglobin from the blood into the urine. The evidence points toward the glomerular tuft as responsible for the passage of the hemoglobin from the blood plasma into the tubules. The glomerular tuft establishes the true hemoglobin threshold under these conditions. If the convoluted tubules are normal, we note that hemoglobin is taken into the epithelium and this explains the high initial renal threshold. With repeated hemoglobin injections this tubular epithelium becomes stuffed with hemoglobin pigment fractions and can absorb no more, which explains the minimal {{or depression}} threshold. Further injury of this tubular epithelium with mercury causes no change in this minimal renal threshold, unless we produce actual <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction...</b>|$|E
40|$|Obstruction of {{proximal}} tubules initiates cytoresistance against hypoxic damage. Following acute {{tubular necrosis}} (ATTN), cytoresistance to further renal injury results. However, the initiating {{events and the}} subcellular determinants of this phenomenon have not been defined. Since <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> {{is a consequence of}} ATN, this study evaluated whether it alters tubular susceptibility to hypoxic damage. Extrarenal obstruction (ureteral ligation in rats) was used for this purpose to dissociate obstructive effects from those of ATN. Twenty-four hours following ureteral ligation or sham surgery, cortical proximal tubular segments (PTS) were isolated and subjected to hypoxic (15 or 30 min) /reoxygenation injury. Since oxidant stress, cell Ca 2 + overload, and PLA 2 attack are purported mediators of hypoxic/reoxygenation injury, degrees of FeS 04, Ca 2 + ionophore, and phospholipase A 2 -induced PTS damage also were assessed. The cell injury (% LDH release) which resulted from each of the above was consistently less in PTS obtained from obstructed kidneys. This cytoresistance: (a) did not require prior uremia to develop (seen with unilateral obstruction); (b) it did not appear to correlate with a tubular proliferative response (assessed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression); (c) it was uninfluenced by early tubular repair (unchanged by 24 hrs of obstruction release); and (d) it occurred without increased heat shock protein (HSP- 70) or antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase, catalase) expression. Total adenylate pools were higher in obstructed versus control PTS during injury; however, this appeared to be a correlate of the protection, rather than a mediator of it. In contrast, obstructed tubules manifested a primary increase in plasma membrane resistance to PLA 2 attack (˜ 3 -fold less lysophosphatidylcholine and free fatty acid generation in obstructed vs. control PTS during incubation with exogenous PLA 2) · In sum, these results indicate that: (1) <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> protects PTS from injury, suggesting that its development during ATN may initiate cytoresistance; and (2) this cytoresistance appears to be mediated, at least in part, by a direct increase in plasma membrane resistance to PLA 2 and potentially other forms (such as, oxidant stress, cytosolic Ca 2 + loading) of attack...|$|E
40|$|An {{association}} between hemolytic disease, acute renal insufficiency, and hemoglobin casts in kidney tubules was first recognized by Yorke and Nauss in 1911 (1). Baker and Dodds (2) reported the first experimental work on obstruction of renal tubules by hemoglobin casts and observed that rabbits with alkaline urine did not form casts whereas those with acid urine did so. They postulated that the renal lesion resulting from transfusion reactions {{was based on}} the formation of intratubular casts with resulting obstruction. DeGowin, Osterhagen, and Andersch (3) also concluded that the renal lesion of transfusion reactions in man was based on <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> by hemoglobin casts. Dunn, Gillespie, and Niven (4) described the histopathology of kidneys from persons sustaining crushing injuries and noted that these lesions were characterized by tubular casts confined to the lower portions of the nephron. They also observed that a toxic reaction appeared to occur in the cells near the casts of involved tubules. Bywaters et al. (5) studied casualties who had sustained crushing injuries and found that myoglobin was present in the urine and that pigmen...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the known}} purine and {{pyrimidine}} bases found in nucleic acids, adenine has proved unique {{as a relatively}} toxic substance. Reports appearing {{at the turn of}} the present century demonstrated that administration of the base was followed by deposition of occluding, crystalline masses in renal tubules (Minkowsky, 1898; Nicolaiev, 1902; Ebstein and Bendix, 1904). More modern studies (Ben-dich et al., 1950) have confirmed an earlier indication (Nicolaiev, 1902) that the intratuhular deposits consisted of a poorly soluble oxidation product of adenine metabolism, i. e., 2, 8 -dioxyadenine. Impairment of renal function attending <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> by 2, 8 -dioxyadenine might reasonably explain many of the features of adenine intoxication. There is an additional metabolic property which serves to distinguish adenine from the other bases found in nucleic acids. Of those substances only adenine is effectively utilized by the rat for the synthesis of polynucleotides (Brown, 1950). In addition, one other purine base, 2, 6 -diaminopurine, serves as an effective precursor of nucleic acid purine in the same species (Bendich et al., 1950; Brown...|$|E
40|$|Glomerular {{hemodynamics}} in mercury-induced acute renal failure. As manifest by tubular {{collapse and}} the virtual absence of {{flow into the}} glomerulotubular junction (GTJ), filtration in most nephrons (SNGFR) of rats poisoned with 9 mg/kg body wt HgCl 2 16 to 28 hours earlier was virtually absent. Arterial colloid osmotic pressure (COPA) and Bowman's space pressure (PBS) were modestly depressed (P 0. 2). A wide spread of Pg values in individual glomeruli {{and the absence of}} tubular flow despite the appearance of i. v. injected lissamine green in a quadrant of surface glomeruli suggested the possibility of a greatly increased, glomerular capillary resistance. It is concluded that reciprocal changes in RA and RE are the immediate cause of filtration failure in this form of ARF and that, in the virtual absence of filtration, tubular leakage can play no important role. Since PBS was depressed in both the developmental and established phases of ARF, <b>tubular</b> <b>obstruction</b> appears to play no direct role in the pathogenesis of this particular model of murine acute renal failure...|$|E
