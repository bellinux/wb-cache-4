5|$|However, Gandhi had sound {{reasons for}} his decision. <b>The</b> <b>salt</b> tax was a deeply {{symbolic}} choice, since salt was used by nearly everyone in India, to replace <b>the</b> <b>salt</b> lost by sweating in India's tropical climate. An item of daily use could resonate more with all classes of citizens than an abstract demand for greater political rights. <b>The</b> <b>salt</b> tax represented 8.2% of the British Raj tax revenue, and hurt the poorest Indians the most significantly.|$|E
5|$|Atlético de Kolkata {{qualified}} for the play-offs after they drew Goa at <b>the</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake Stadium 1–1 on 10 December 2014.

5|$|According to Sarma, Gandhi {{recruited}} {{women to}} participate in <b>the</b> <b>salt</b> tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity {{in the mainstream of}} Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because he feared he would be accused of using women as political shield. When women insisted that they join the movement and public demonstrations, according to Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him. Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian women joined <b>the</b> <b>Salt</b> March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in a manner Gandhi inspired.|$|E
