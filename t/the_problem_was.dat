50|$|If P0, &hellip; Pm are all {{positive}} semidefinite, then <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> convex. If these matrices {{are neither}} positive nor negative semidefinite, <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> non-convex. If P1, &hellip; Pm are all zero, then the constraints {{are in fact}} linear and <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> a quadratic program.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> linear we can {{use some}} type of matrix inverse method—often <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> ill-posed or {{unstable}} so {{we will need to}} regularize it: good, simple methods include the normal equation or singular value decomposition. If <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> weakly nonlinear, an iterative method such Newton-Raphson may be appropriate.|$|R
5000|$|Critique phase: <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> {{investigated}} critically and thoroughly. First of all, a visualised brainstorming {{is performed}} {{and a general}} and critical question concerning <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> framed.|$|R
5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E

5|$|By 2000, {{deliveries}} were delayed, and in June all trams {{were taken}} out of service for three weeks to modify the gearboxes. In October, ten of thirteen trams {{were taken out}} of service due to radial run-out. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> large enough that some trams got a new radial run-out the day after they were fixed. From 6 January 2001, SL95 could be used on the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line, and from 6 February, on the Ekeberg Line. However, the latter still had too short platforms.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} three general {{problems}} concerning construction of evolutionary trees are considered. Algorithms for <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> presented and <b>the</b> complexity of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> investigated. <b>The</b> thesis {{consists of three}} corresponding parts. The first part <b>is</b> devoted to <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of constructing evolutionary trees in the experiment model. Different algorithms for <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>are</b> given, including an optimal algorithm for constructing evolutionary trees and an optimal algorithm for merging two evolutionary trees. Matching lower bounds are also provided. The {{second part of the}} thesis presents results related to the inferred consensus tree <b>problem.</b> <b>The</b> optimization version of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> shown to be NP-complete and two heuristic algorithms are presented. Further, the ordered version of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> studied. In <b>the</b> last part of the thesis the complexity of the maximum homeomorphic subtree <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> examined. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> shown to be hard to approximate, unless P=NP, even for trees of constant height, whereas a constant approximation ratio is obtained in case of a constant number of trees of constant height...|$|R
5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{will take}} over Eurasian nuthatch nest holes, reducing their breeding success. This {{is most likely to}} occur if the nest is high in a tree and there is a good local breeding density of the nuthatch. Introduced ring-necked parakeets may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend to occur in fragmented urban woodlands, while nuthatches prefer large old oak woodlands, which reduces the level of competition. Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impacts {{state of}} health was {{uncertain}} during the first day after launch. Shortly after entering orbit around the Sun and deploying its solar panels, the probe switched itself to safe mode. The cause of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> simply an incorrect temperature limit in the fault protection logic for the spacecraft's RCS thruster catalyst beds. The spacecraft's thrusters were used to detumble the spacecraft following third stage separation. On January 13, 2005, NASA announced that the probe was out of safe mode and healthy.|$|E
5|$|During 1997, {{there were}} five {{incidents}} where NSB's Nordic Mobile Telephone equipment interfered with the locomotive's electronics, causing the emergency brakes to activate. This caused a temporary halt until the motorman had unlocked the brakes. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> fixed by moving NSB's mobile senders. The units were taken into use on the Bergen Line from 5 January 1997. Later they entered into use on the Dovre and Sørland Lines, and then on regional trains around Oslo, such as the Vestfold Line. In August 1998, NSB stated that El 18 used more power {{than some of the}} substation transformers along the line could handle, particularly along the Vestfold Line. Part of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> caused by a mechanism in the locomotives whereby the motor was turned off if the wheels spin. The result was that the full power output of the El 18 along parts of the railway network could not be utilized.|$|E

5|$|Maunsell {{was aware}} of the {{reputation}} for poor steaming enjoyed by the class and attempted to address it by the fitting of twin Kylchap blastpipes to No. 860 in 1934. However, <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> ultimately solved by Oliver Bulleid, Maunsell's replacement as Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Southern in 1938. He fitted larger diameter chimneys and Lemaître multiple jet blastpipes, which effectively transformed their performance. Thereafter the class was highly respected.|$|E
5|$|Part of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> that Bordeaux may {{not have}} {{appeared}} a plausible Allied target because {{it was out of}} range of fighter aircraft cover from the United Kingdom. Historian Terry Crowdy's analysis is that Ironside may have suffered simply from lack of resources. In common with other, higher-impact, Bodyguard deceptions it preyed on a concern that the Allies knew Hitler and the German High Command had discussed. Crowdy suggests that with physical deception, and more effort, Ironside could have succeeded {{in the same way as}} deceptions aimed against Calais, Normandy and the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|Situational {{awareness}} {{was also}} reduced because the pilots {{did not have}} a chart in front of them at all times. The crew was not aware that they could check the aircraft location in relation to the centerline with a VDF. The crew probably put too much emphasis on the indications displayed by the GPS. The aircraft descended into mountainous terrain without control over the lateral navigation. Despite uncertainty and disagreement in the group, the approach was not abandoned, as the aircraft should have climbed to a safe altitude while <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> solved.|$|E
5|$|Technetium can {{catalyse}} {{the destruction}} of hydrazine by nitric acid, and this property is due to its multiplicity of valencies.
