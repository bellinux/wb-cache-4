50|$|Data {{format and}} transformation: To avoid every adapter having to convert data to/from every other applications' formats, EAI systems usually {{stipulate}} an application-independent (or common) data format.

This is done in two steps: the adapter converts information from the application's format to the bus's common format. Then, semantic transformations are applied on this (converting zip codes to city names, splitting/merging objects from one application into objects in the other applications, and so on).|$|E
