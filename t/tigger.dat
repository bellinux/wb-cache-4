5|$|Poohsticks {{was invented}} by English author A. A. Milne for his son Christopher Robin Milne. The sport first came to {{prominence}} when it was described in the author's book The House at Pooh Corner {{as well as in}} the Disney animated featurette Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore. Winnie-the-Pooh, the protagonist of the book, accidentally drops a pine cone into a river from a bridge and, after observing how it appeared on the other side of the bridge, devises the rules for Poohsticks. Pooh continues to play the sport with the other characters, Christopher Robin, <b>Tigger</b> and Eeyore.|$|E
25|$|Since 1966, Disney has {{released}} numerous animated productions starring Winnie the Pooh and related characters. These have included theatrical featurettes, television series, and direct-to-video films, {{as well as}} the theatrical feature-length films The <b>Tigger</b> Movie, Piglet's Big Movie, Pooh's Heffalump Movie, and Winnie the Pooh.|$|E

25|$|A. A. Milne {{named the}} {{character}} Winnie-the-Pooh after {{a teddy bear}} owned by his son, Christopher Robin Milne, who {{was the basis for}} the character Christopher Robin. The rest of Christopher Robin Milne's toys, Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga, Roo and <b>Tigger,</b> were incorporated into Milne's stories. Two more characters, Owl and Rabbit, were created by Milne's imagination, while Gopher was added to the Disney version. Christopher Robin's toy bear is on display at the Main Branch of the New York Public Library in New York City.|$|E
500|$|In William Blake's poem in the Songs of Experience, titled [...] "The Tyger," [...] {{the tiger}} is a menacing and fearful animal. In Yann Martel's 2001 Man Booker Prize winning novel Life of Pi, the protagonist, {{surviving}} shipwreck for {{months in a}} small boat, somehow avoids being eaten by the other survivor, a large Bengal tiger. The story was adapted in Ang Lee's 2012 feature film of the same name. Jim Corbett's 1944 Man-Eaters of Kumaon tells ten true stories of his tiger-hunting exploits {{in what is now}} the northern Uttarakhand region of India. The book has sold over four million copies, and has been the basis of both fictional and documentary films. In Rudyard Kipling's 1894 The Jungle Book, the tiger, Shere Khan, is the mortal enemy of the human protagonist, Mowgli; the book has formed the basis of both live-action and animated films. Other tiger characters aimed at children tend to be more benign, as for instance <b>Tigger</b> in A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh and Hobbes of the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, both of whom are represented as simply stuffed animals come to life.|$|E
500|$|The opening sequence, {{in which}} the Doctor barely hangs onto the {{crashing}} TARDIS as it flies over London, was later added to the script to bridge from the conclusion of The End of Time to the TARDIS's crash into Amy's garden. Moffat {{thought it would be}} funny if they showed him hanging out of the TARDIS and nearly crashing into London, which would start an episode set {{in a small town in}} a big way. Moffat also referenced the scene from A.A. Milne's The House at Pooh Corner, where <b>Tigger</b> claims to like everything, but then proceeds to reject all food offered to him until he finally finds that he likes extract of malt. Moffat's variant had the newly regenerated Doctor reject a variety of foods, with the exception of fish fingers with custard, offered to him by the young Amy. Moffat felt that appealing to children was important to the show's success. The scene where the Doctor creates the virus using Jeff's laptop was originally set in a classroom where the Doctor used the students' computers; this was changed for production reasons. In the episode, the Doctor snaps his fingers to open the TARDIS, a trick his previous incarnation learned from River Song in [...] "Silence in the Library"/"Forest of the Dead". He also repeats the lines [...] "wibbley-wobbley, timey-wimey" [...] and [...] "some cowboys in here" [...] from the Moffat-written episodes [...] "Blink" [...] and [...] "The Girl in the Fireplace".|$|E

500|$|When [...] "Better than Today" [...] {{became a}} single, reviews {{for the song}} itself were mixed. McAlpine of BBC said [...] "the {{relentless}} swaggering momentum" [...] of the track [...] "gets a little wearing". He continued, [...] "At some point, something ELSE needs to happen, y'see [...] No {{matter how many times}} Kylie's voice swoops up high and skips back down again, no matter how firmly she pushes herself into those demanding choruses; it begins like <b>Tigger</b> and ends like a route march around an aerobics class." [...] He gave the single three out of five stars. Popjustice, while stating the song is [...] "rather enjoyable", added that it is a [...] "no-harm-intended album track" [...] instead of [...] "the big balls-out I'm-bloody-Kylie comeback single". They remarked at a later date, saying that they were [...] "slightly alarmed" [...] when the song became a single. Nima Baniamer of Contact Music described the song as [...] "a fun electro number", but it [...] "sadly doesn't seem to pack a punch enough to stand firm as a lead-out track". Originally in an album review, Levine of Digital Spy called the tune [...] "as uplifting a dance-pop ditty as we're likely to hear all year". In a single review, Levine re-evaluated the song, stating that it is not [...] "the freshest confection you'll sample this party season" [...] but he continued, calling it [...] "sweet, seductive and pretty much impossible not to succumb to over and over again". He gave the single four out of five stars.|$|E

2500|$|Disney {{had small}} roles written for Boag in The Absent-Minded Professor and Son of Flubber. It was Disney's {{intention}} to use Boag {{as the voice of}} <b>Tigger</b> in Winnie the Pooh. While at a story meeting for Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day, Disney felt that Wally Boag was perfect for the role of <b>Tigger.</b> However, while watching out for him, Disney died from lung cancer in December 1966. Boag auditioned for <b>Tigger</b> when it was aired until the role ultimately went to Paul Winchell after it aired. [...] Except for a cameo appearance in The Love Bug, Boag did not appear in any more Disney films.|$|E

2500|$|Pooh is {{very fond}} of food, {{especially}} [...] "hunny" [...] but also condensed milk and other items. When he visits friends, his desire to be offered a snack is {{in conflict with the}} impoliteness of asking too directly.
