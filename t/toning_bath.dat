50|$|Over {{a period}} of 8 years (1866-1873), he made {{detailed}} observations of the weather and of the night skies from Well Head, which he published in 1874. A keen photographer, he produced several inventions, including Waterhouse stops for cameras and photographic lenses and an alkaline gold <b>toning</b> <b>bath</b> (see page from 1892 book, figure to the right, below).|$|E
5000|$|He {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} of {{inserting}} an imported sky into a landscape photograph to mitigate the problems of sensitivity of the collodion plates, a process that he justified in a letter of 6 November 1861 to the journal Moniteur de la photographie. In the April 1862 issue of the British Journal of Photography he published his findings on the presence of [...] "anti-chlors" [...] in photographic paper, a substance that jeopardised the stability of silver prints. He introduced borax and phosphate <b>toning</b> <b>baths</b> that are still used today, as well as pioneering the use of iodide.|$|R

Returning to his original profession as a mining engineer, he bought the sulphur springs of Moudang and a salt mine in Dax, but these were failures. He died suddenly in 1906 at his residence at 60 Finborough Road, South Kensington, London, and was buried at St Mary the Boltons, Kensington. In its review of the year 1906, the British Journal of Photography noted his death and offered the following estimation of his contribution to photographic processing: The death of Farnham Maxwell Lyte deprives photography of one of its early workers, though his active connection with photography lasted only about sixteen years - from 1854 to 1870. His most notable achievement in photographic process was, however, the invention of the so-called [...] "honey" [...] process, by which the wet collodion plate could be retained in workable condition for several days ... Mr. Lyte {{was also one of the}} first to point out the danger to photographs of [...] "anti-chlor" [...] impurities in mounts. He was the originator of the present borax and phosphate <b>toning</b> <b>baths</b> and the introducer of iodine into collodion emulsion for better color rendering.|$|R
5000|$|The {{next great}} {{achievement}} for Gutekunst was the panorama of the 1876 Centennial Exposition held in Fairmount Park in Philadelphia. The {{description of the}} work is as follows: “This ten feet long by eighteen inch wide picture was made from seven negatives by William Bell that were taken from a scaffold erected near the Belmont reservoir. The panoramic view printed on a single sheet of paper show all the buildings from Agricultural Hall to the Observatory on George’s Hill. The large sheet of albumen paper for this panorama was supplied by the John H. Clemons factory on Sansom Street. The whites of one hundred and twenty five dozen eggs were required to coat the paper. To produce the print the entire sheet had to be exposed to sunlight, one section at a time, under each negative. Careful joining of the negatives was required to prevent a dark line from appearing at each juncture. Each section had to be printed to the same density despite the ever changing light from the sky. After printing out to a much darker shade than desired, the final appearance of the print was achieved through gold toning which had to be evenly applied or some of the blacks would have a bluish cast and others a reddish tone. Great difficulty was also encountered handling such a large sheet of wet paper as it passed through the fixing <b>baths,</b> <b>toning</b> and washing processes. The success with which he achieved a uniform color and tone can be seen today from a framed copy of the print hanging in the Library Company of Philadelphia.” ...|$|R
