5|$|Difficulties {{arise in}} tracing {{the history of}} design {{management}}. Even though design management as an expression is first mentioned in literature in 1964, earlier contributions created <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> expression could arise. Throughout its history, design management was influenced {{by a number of}} different disciplines: architecture, industrial design, management, software development, engineering; and movements such as system theory, design methodologies. It cannot be attributed directly to either design nor to management.|$|E
5|$|A {{thorough}} stylistic {{analysis of}} the ornamentation of the monument, in particular of the figures within the circles of the Battle scene and the Scene of sacrifice reveal a surprising sensitivity to bronze {{on the part of}} Cairano, and considerable scope for reinterpretation and commingling of styles. This stemmed from a sensible response to <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> mausoleum was designed and implemented. Unprecedented in Brescia was the combination of bronze and stone, the former under the supervision of Bernardino delle Croci who certainly had a vast catalogue of references to ancient and contemporary works, all of which are cited in the major and minor rounds on the base. It is difficult to exclude Cairano from the influence of so much classicism, but the sole Scene of sacrifice attests to the sophistication of his chisel and the innovative combination of sculpture and bronzes around 1510, to which date much of the remaining lapidary apparatus can also be placed.|$|E

25|$|Perception {{of color}} depends heavily on <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> {{perceived}} object is presented. For example, a white page under blue, pink, or purple light will reflect mostly blue, pink, or purple {{light to the}} eye, respectively; the brain, however, compensates for the effect of lighting (based on the color shift of surrounding objects) and {{is more likely to}} interpret the page as white under all three conditions, a phenomenon known as color constancy.|$|E
25|$|It {{is notable}} that as <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> {{characters}} evolved, Michel also is shown getting older. While {{he looked like}} a young man of about twenty years {{at the beginning of his}} adventures, he is seen progressively reaching middle-age. Recently his appearance is younger than previously. Other fictional characters are also shown getting older. In recent years, their general appearance has become steady. In spite of this he is still depicted as quite young for a man who has competed against drivers of multiple generations, including Juan Manuel Fangio, Graham Hill and Ayrton Senna.|$|E
25|$|Although forced-choice {{questionnaires}} show {{a statistically}} significant sex- difference, critics {{of the theory of}} evolved sex differences in jealousy question these findings. In consideration of the entire body of work on sex differences, Harris (2003) asserted that when methods other than forced-choice questionnaires are used to identify an innate sex difference, inconsistencies between studies begin to arise. For example, in a study by Sangrin & Guadango (2005), the authors found that women sometimes report feeling more intense jealousy in response to both sexual and emotional infidelity. The results of these studies also depended on <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> participants were made to describe what type of jealousy they felt, as well as the intensity of their jealousy. From this study, it is clear that context plays a role in the responses men and women give researchers and therefore how sex-differences are interpreted.|$|E

25|$|People rely on compulsions as {{an escape}} from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the {{intrusive}} thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for {{eight hours a day}} would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.|$|E

[...] However, the album itself only lists the titles of the films, omitting <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> music was originally presented and leaving the compositions to [...] "speak for themselves".|$|E

2500|$|We {{refer to}} the {{relations}} which supposedly describe a certain physical situation, as a model. Typically, a model consists {{of one or more}} equations. The quantities appearing in the equations we classify into variables and parameters. The distinction between these is not always clear cut, and it frequently depends on <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> variables appear. Usually a model is designed to explain the relationships that exist among quantities which can be measured independently in an experiment; these are the variables of the model. To formulate these relationships, however, one frequently introduces [...] "constants" [...] which stand for inherent properties of nature (or of the materials and equipment used in a given experiment). These are the parameters.|$|E

[...] After his remarks were criticized, Burns issued an apology, saying, [...] "Such views are {{inappropriate}} and belong in the past and that was <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> story was told...they are views which I do not condone and do not share."

2500|$|The {{efforts to}} begin another unionization drive began between 1974-1976, {{soon after the}} {{previous}} drive ended. While the issues involved in the second drive paralleled those of the last—low wages, lack of benefits, unfair grievance procedures, racism against a workforce that was nearly 60% black—this drive prioritized a depoliticized atmosphere to avoid the infighting of the last drive. [...] The second drive was organized in a more bureaucratic manner than the first as a representative from the international AFSCME led the organization efforts. [...] Thus, <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> second drive was coordinated contributed {{to the use of}} new tactics. Like the drive of 1974, the second drive failed, but this time as a result of employees’ fear of Duke and a lack of fervor in unionization efforts.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{phase is}} {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} synonym for state of matter, but there can be several immiscible phases of the same state of matter. Also, the term phase is sometimes {{used to refer to}} a set of equilibrium states demarcated in terms of state variables such as pressure and temperature by a phase boundary on a phase diagram. Because phase boundaries relate to changes in the organization of matter, such as a change from liquid to solid or a more subtle change from one crystal structure to another, this latter usage is similar to the use of [...] "phase" [...] as a synonym for state of matter.
