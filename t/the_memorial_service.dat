5|$|After a long {{struggle}} with diabetes, Mau died {{on his home}} island of Satawal at 18:30 Micronesia time, Monday, July 12, 2010. As is the tradition on Satawal, travel between the islands was temporarily suspended in Mau's honour. Because there is no morgue on the island, Mau was buried the following day, and a nightly rosary was held until <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> <b>service</b> on July 21 at Santa Soledad Church. Mau's son Henry Yarofalpiy will continue teaching students about their culture, preserving the legacy of his father.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan was {{afflicted by}} illness {{in his final}} years. He was {{diagnosed}} with throat cancer in 1993 before contracting an inoperable lung cancer, which led to his death on 6 February 1999. A public memorial service was held on 9 February at the Adelaide Festival Centre {{as a tribute to}} Dunstan's love of the arts. In attendance were former Labor Prime Ministers Gough Whitlam and Bob Hawke, Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley, Premier John Olsen, and State Opposition Leader Mike Rann. Thousands more gathered outside the centre in Elder Park {{along the banks of the}} River Torrens. State flags were flown at half-mast and <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> <b>service</b> was televised live.|$|E
5|$|Leslie is {{approached}} by scouts looking for potential candidates for elected office, {{which has always}} been one of her dreams. Impressed by <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> <b>service</b> and the harvest festival Leslie previously organized, they believe she would be a good candidate for upcoming city council seats, or possibly the mayoral position. With the expected increased media attention on her personal life, the scouts ask whether Leslie has any secret scandals in her life. She denies any such scandals exist, thus omitting her secret relationship with Ben, and the scouts promise to contact her about preparing an electoral run.|$|E

40|$|The author {{tells her}} {{experience}} at performing at <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> <b>services</b> {{of a man}} who shot and killed two others before killing himself.   She describes how her many years of working as music therapist with psychiatric patients, using  clinical improvisation and through her study of the Bonny Method of Guided and Imagery prepared both professionally and personally for this experience. She also reflects on her development and as a singer and explores her identity as a singer and how it is intertwined with her identity as a music therapist.   During her performance at <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> <b>services</b> she has, what she describes, as an intense peak experience and describes it as similar to Helen Bonny's peak experience she had during a violin performance.   She further describes her experience as becoming one with the music and recounts how the music served as a therapeutic container for <b>the</b> entire <b>memorial</b> <b>service</b> and how trusting where the music was leading was a powerful and humbling experience...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>memorial</b> <b>services</b> were {{attended}} by several high-ranking German officials, with President Richard von Weizsäcker giving the first speech. Chancellor Helmut Kohl {{was criticized for}} not visiting Solingen nor attending <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> or burial services; he had denounced what he called [...] "Beileidstourismus" [...] ("condolence tourism") of other politicians.|$|R
5|$|The press had an {{aggressive}} {{coverage of the}} accident. Several major press organizations attended <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> <b>service,</b> and newspapers published close-up pictures of crying next of kin on their front pages. The Norwegian Press Complaints Commission, a committee appointed by the newspapers themselves, acquitted Dagbladet after a complaint for their aggressive image use. However, the accident coverage started an internal debate among journalists about their coverage of major accidents. The conclusion was that private sorrow {{was not to be}} covered in the media and since the media has had a strict self-enforcement of such a policy.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} prepares for <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> <b>service,</b> Leslie and Ben are caught making {{out by a}} {{maintenance}} worker named George (Biff Yeager), so they send him home with a gift certificate {{in exchange for his}} silence. Unfortunately, George had the propane for Li'l Sebastian's eternal flame, which results in later confusion behind the scenes, that Leslie and Ben struggle to fix throughout the night. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is sent to get propane for the flame but buys lighter fluid instead; this causes a huge fireball to shoot into the air when Ron lights it, which singes off his eyebrows, part of his mustache and hair. Leslie and Ben are relieved, however, when the crowd applauds in the belief the fireball was staged. Entertainment 720's show also proves to be a hit with the crowd, which makes Tom further contemplate quitting his job.|$|E
5|$|Brad and Tracy Stevens are {{involved}} with the American Cancer Society's Coaches Vs. Cancer. Brad says that the cause really hit home for them after Tracy's mother died of the disease in June 2004. The day before Butler's 2010 Final Four appearance, they hosted a fundraiser for the organization. Brad Stevens has also volunteered his time to the Jukes Foundation for Kids, a charity benefiting Ugandan children run by former Butler player Avery Jukes. Stevens remains in close touch with the Butler basketball family; he notably took a one-game leave from the Celtics in January 2016 to visit with Andrew Smith, a player on both of Butler's Final Four teams who was dying of cancer; Smith died {{less than a week}} later. At the request of Andrew's widow, Sam, Brad delivered the eulogy at <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> <b>service</b> on January 17, 2016.|$|E

5|$|González-Gordon {{has been}} {{described}} as being proud of his Scottish heritage, which centred on the town of Huntly and the Clan Gordon. His personal clothing style reflected this; he was noted for his tweed jackets and British clothes in general. He had been married to Milagro López de Carrizosa y Eizaguirre for 62 years before she died in July 2013. The couple had two children, Bibiana and Mauricio, with Mauricio being the current president of the family company. During the three final years of his life González-Gordon was in poor health and could hardly leave his home. He died on 27 September 2013 in his hometown of Jerez de la Frontera at the age of 89. His family claims that the last thing he drank was a Tío Pepe, the most famous brand of the family business. His death occurred at the Asisa clinic where he had spent his last couple of weeks. <b>The</b> <b>memorial</b> <b>service</b> was held at the San Juan Bautista de La Salle church on 28 September.|$|E
5|$|In December 2001, aged 101, she {{fractured}} her pelvis in a fall. Even so, {{she insisted}} on standing for the National Anthem during <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> <b>service</b> for her husband on 6 February the following year. Just three days later, her second daughter Princess Margaret died. On 13 February 2002, the Queen Mother fell and cut her arm in her sitting room at Sandringham House; an ambulance and doctor were called, and the wound was dressed. She was still determined to attend Margaret's funeral at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, two days later on the Friday of that week, even though the Queen {{and the rest of}} the royal family were concerned about the journey the Queen Mother would face to get from Norfolk to Windsor; she was also rumoured to be hardly eating. Nevertheless, she flew to Windsor by helicopter, and so that no photographs of her in a wheelchair could be taken—she insisted that she be shielded from the press—she travelled to the service in a people carrier with blacked–out windows, which had been previously used by Margaret.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Peel {{played for}} Accrington. His signing was widely {{reported}} in the press. Before this, most professionals in league cricket were neither famous names nor particularly good cricketers. According to Pearson, in his survey of club cricket {{in the north of}} England, Peel was the first international cricketer to play in a league. He took 80 wickets that season, but only received a third of his salary; the committee withheld the rest because of unspecified problems during the season. His contract was not renewed and he instead became the professional at Morley. Pearson suggests that Peel's signing showed the clubs that big-name signings could bring benefits. Peel also accepted a position as a coach at Essex in 1899, and remained there until at least 1904. The press suggested that he would qualify for Essex, but he never played for that team. He later became the landlord of a public house in Churwell. In 1923 he resumed his connection with Yorkshire when he undertook a coaching and scouting programme for the county, in association with George Hirst, organised by the Yorkshire Evening News. Peel remained close to the Yorkshire players. When the four Yorkshire members of the English team that toured Australia in 1932–33 departed from Leeds, Peel was present and gave each of them a white rose—the symbol of Yorkshire. He attended the funeral of Roy Kilner in 1928, and was one of many Yorkshire cricketers to attend <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> <b>service</b> for Lord Hawke in 1938. Peel continued to play cricket and coach locally into his seventies. In his later years, he worked in a woollen mill in Morley.|$|E
