Those who {{speak the same}} language are joined to each other by a multitude of invisible bonds by nature herself, long before any human art begins; <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> each other and have the power of continuing to make themselves understood more and more clearly; they belong together and are by nature one and an inseparable whole.|$|E
5|$|One {{day when}} the boat is out, Sasha finds a bag with a very young cat inside it in the water. The captain takes him home and names him Patch. The spring thaw arrives, and the captain ties up the boat and prepares to go elsewhere. Sasha decides not {{to go with the}} captain and Patch because she now knows that she is going to have kits, and wants them born in the forest. Patch and the captain are sad, but <b>they</b> <b>understand.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} an {{individual}} – signified by the tolling of the bell – is thus a treasure buried {{at the bottom of}} a mine: only of value if it is given to someone who makes good use of it. In this he refers to the work of Augustine of Hippo, specifically On Christian Doctrine, in which Augustine describes the knowledge of pagans as gold and silver: something that can be involved in Christian purposes if appropriated properly. Donne, twisting this idea, is arguing that the {{death of an}}y individual is something others can learn from, should <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> it properly.|$|E
500|$|The composer's {{response}} to his denunciation was the Fifth Symphony of 1937, which was musically more conservative than his earlier works. Premiered on 21 November 1937 in Leningrad, it was a phenomenal success. The Fifth drove many to tears and welling emotions. Later, Shostakovich's purported memoir, Testimony, stated: [...] "I'll never believe {{that a man who}} understood nothing could feel the Fifth Symphony. Of course <b>they</b> <b>understood,</b> <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> what was happening around them and <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> what the Fifth was about." ...|$|R

5|$|Drivers are {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, although the results are admissible in court. The Alcotest has replaced the Breathalyzer as the standard device for determining blood alcohol level. When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in a language that <b>they</b> <b>understand.</b> A person can be charged with DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years.|$|E
5|$|The San Diego {{chapter of}} JC's Girls {{is based at}} the Rock Church, a 10,000-member church with a {{majority}} of members {{under the age of}} 30. In the first year, several strippers left the sex industry and began volunteering with the chapter. Many of the chapter's members do not personally visit strip clubs but help in other ways. Scher said the former strippers were the most effective JC's Girls volunteers because <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> from personal experience the situations of the women they are trying to help. By 2011, members of the San Diego chapter of JC's Girls were visiting strip clubs twice each month. They pray before, during, and after each visit and a team of other members pray for them from another location.|$|E
5|$|Gifford arrives, {{and most}} of the town attends the celebratory event, where Chef sings a song to seduce her. Mr. Garrison takes his {{position}} in a tall book depository, but he is frustrated to see that Gifford is hidden behind a bulletproof glass bubble. Wendy and Stan arrive and try unsuccessfully to stop Mr. Garrison, saying that <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> his pain, but when Stan accidentally reignites Garrison's anger, he decides to go through with the assassination. Just as he's about to fire, Cartman's new immense weight causes the stage to collapse, catapulting Gifford off it, and causing the bullet to hit Kenny in the head. Kenny is propelled through the air and impaled on a flagpole. Gifford's bodyguards whisk Gifford away, costing a disappointed Cartman his chance to be on television. Wendy takes to the stage and reveals that Cartman cheated on his essay, but the townspeople are too upset about Gifford's departure to care. Mr. Garrison is taken to a mental hospital, where Mr. Hat is placed into a straitjacket. Mr. Garrison apologizes to the kids for costing the town a chance to be on television, although Kyle explains to him that Cartman is now appearing on talk show Geraldo because of his tremendous obesity. The episode ends with Chef having sex with Gifford while watching Geraldo.|$|E

Open orthodox (which is closer to conservative ideology) Rabbi Shmuly Yanklowitz declared that the Jewish values of justice, equality, and dignity lead him to support the cause of gay rights and advocate for same-sex civil marriage.|$|E

However, {{the difference between the}} two theories is conversation theory specifically focuses on the dynamics of two people. Text and conversation theory is typically applied to at least two people. Conversation theory emphasizes the construct of knowledge of meaning and the cause and effect relationship that occurs as a result of self-learning from communication, based on meaning.|$|E
25|$|Children with Down {{syndrome}} {{have increased}} difficulty forming friendships. They experience a language delay {{causing them to}} have a harder time playing with other children. Most children with Down syndrome may prefer to watch other students and play alongside a friend but not with them, mostly because <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> more than they can outwardly express. In preschool years, children with Down syndrome can benefit from the classroom setting, surrounded by other children and less dependent on adult aid. Children with this disability benefit from a variety of interactions with both adults and children. At school, ensuring an inclusive environment in the classroom can be difficult, but proximity to close friends can be crucial for social development.|$|E
