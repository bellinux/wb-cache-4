5|$|A third {{approach}} achieves some of {{the output}} benefits of <b>tracking,</b> with a lesser penalty in terms of land area, capital and operating cost. This involves <b>tracking</b> the sun in one dimension – in its daily journey across the sky – but not adjusting for the seasons. The angle of the axis is normally horizontal, though some, such as the solar park at Nellis Airforce Base, which have a 20° tilt, incline the axis towards the equator in a north-south orientation – effectively a hybrid between <b>tracking</b> and fixed tilt.|$|E

5|$|Groundbreaking on the MAR-I site {{started in}} March 1963 and {{construction}} proceeded rapidly.

However, the system demonstrated very low reliability in the transmitter's travelling wave tube (TWT) amplifiers, which led to an extremely expensive re-design and re-installation. Once upgraded, MAR-I demonstrated the system would work as expected; it could generate multiple virtual radar beams, could simultaneously generate different types of beams for detection, <b>tracking,</b> and discrimination at the same time, and had the accuracy and speed needed to generate many tracks.|$|E
