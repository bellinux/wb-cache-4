40|$|In situ {{hybridization}} of Drosophila melanogaster somatic chromosomes {{has been}} used to demonstrate the near exact correspondence between the location of highly repetitious DNA and classically defined constitutive heterochromatin. The Y chromosome, in particular, is heavily labeled even by cRNA transcribed from female (XX) DNA <b>templates</b> (<b>i.</b> e., DNA from female Drosophila with 2 Xs and 2 sets of autosomes). This observation confirms earlier reports that the Y chromosome contains repeated DNA sequences that are shared by other chromosomes. In grain counting experiments the Y chromosome shows significantly heavier label than any other chromosome when hybridized with cRNA from XY DNA <b>templates</b> (<b>i.</b> e., DNA from male Drosophila with 1 X and 1 Y plus 2 sets of autosomes). However, the preferential labeling of the Y is abolished if the cRNA is derived from XX DNA. We interpret these results as indicating the presence of a class of Y chromosome specific repeated DNA in D. melanogaster. The relative inefficiency of the X chromosome in binding cRNA from XY and XYY DNA templates, coupled with its ability to bind XX derived cRNA, may also indicate the presence of an X chromosome specific repeated DNA...|$|R

This interference cost results in an increase in the received Eb/Io relative to FDMA which should be weighted against a reduction in the Eb/Io requirement resulting from using CDMA.
