5|$|A {{telecommunications}} network {{is a collection}} of transmitters, receivers, and communications channels that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, repeaters may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> combat attenuation that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.|$|E
5|$|After an {{extensive}} review of vineyard conditions {{in and around}} the existing Champagne region, INAO presented a proposal to revise the region on March 14, 2008. The proposal was prepared by a group of five experts in the subjects of history, geography, geology, phytosociology and agronomy, working from 2005. The proposal means expanding the region to cover vineyards in 357 rather than 319 villages. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be achieved by adding vineyards in forty villages while simultaneously removing two villages in the Marne départment that were included in the 1927 regulations, Germaine and Orbais-l'Abbaye.|$|E

5|$|Although figs flower asynchronously as a population, in {{most species}} {{flowering}} is synchronised within an individual. Newly emerged female wasps must {{move away from}} their natal tree {{in order to find}} figs in which to lay their eggs. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> the advantage of the fig, since it prevents self-pollination. In Florida, individual F. aurea trees flower and fruit asynchronously. Within-tree asynchrony in flowering is likely to raise the probability of self-pollination, but it may be an adaptation that allows the species to maintain an adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.|$|E
5|$|As it {{has been}} since the {{creation}} of the Auxois stud book, only purebred horses and Ardennes and Trait du Nord crosses are allowed to be registered. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> ensure selection for the desired breed characteristics, which are now a lighter and more active horse than was seen during the time of breeding for horse meat. Horses bred through artificial insemination and embryo transfer are allowed to be registered; those potentially bred through cloning are not. The Syndicat du Cheval de Trait Auxois (Auxois Draft Horse Association) is the national registry, managing the stud book, breed standard and promotion of the breed. An annual breed competition is held in September in Semur-en-Auxois.|$|E
5|$|Availability of mallards, mallard ducklings, and fertilised mallard {{eggs for}} public sale and private ownership, either as {{livestock}} or as pets, is currently legal in the United States {{except for the}} state of Florida, which has currently banned domestic ownership of mallards. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> prevent hybridisation with the native mottled duck.|$|E

5|$|Buses for routes 37, 47 and X47 between Edinburgh and Penicuik were branded as Penicuik City Link, {{with blue}} uppers and roofline, and the {{positions}} of the red and madder on the skirting transposed. In 2011, one of these buses was repainted into madder and white, with no roof colour. However, the other vehicles in Penicuik City Link colours were repainted into the new madder and white livery with a turquoise mint coloured roof and the name Pen-Y-Cog. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> celebrate the history of the area as Pen-Y-Cog is the original name for Penicuik. These buses were de-branded in 2014 due to high fuel consumption of the B7TL's used and the 37/47/X37 is now worked by standards liveries Volvo B9TL's.|$|E
5|$|Escoffier also {{simplified}} {{and organized}} the modern menu {{and structure of}} the meal. He published a series of articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence, and he finally published his Livre des menus in 1912. This type of service embraced the service à la russe (serving meals in separate courses on individual plates), which Félix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of Le Guide Culinaire in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. The book was a collaboration with Philéas Gilbert, E. Fetu, A. Suzanne, B. Reboul, Ch. Dietrich, A. Caillat and others. The significance of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high-profile chefs to this new style of cooking.|$|E
5|$|In June 2005, a team {{of experts}} from the UK, Europe, Egypt, Russia and USA {{undertook}} a joint project to produce a new digital edition of the manuscript (involving all four holding libraries), {{and a series of}} other studies was announced.

5|$|Most of {{the tombs}} are {{not open to}} the public (18 of the tombs can be opened, but they are rarely open at the same time), and {{officials}} occasionally close those that are open for restoration work. The number of visitors to KV62 has led to a separate charge for entry into the tomb. The West Valley has only one open tomb—that of Ay—and a separate ticket is needed to visit this tomb. The tour guides are no longer allowed to lecture inside the tombs, and visitors are expected to proceed quietly and in single file through the tombs. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> minimize time in the tombs and prevent the crowds from damaging the surfaces of the decoration. Photography is no longer allowed in the tombs.|$|E

5|$|Southeast Asian {{traditional}} beliefs, as well {{as traditional}} Chinese medicine, consider the durian fruit to have warming properties liable to cause excessive sweating. The traditional method to counteract <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> pour water into the empty shell of the fruit after the pulp has been consumed and drink it. An alternative method is to eat the durian in accompaniment with mangosteen, which is considered to have cooling properties. Pregnant women or people {{with high blood pressure}} are traditionally advised not to consume durian.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{added that}} there is a need for the {{decision-maker}} to adduce evidence in court to prove that considerations of national security are involved. A mere assertion by the decision-maker that a matter involves national security does not preclude the court's judicial function of determining whether the decision was in fact based on grounds of national security. In other words, national security cannot be raised as a plea in bar to prevent the court from considering an application at all. However, what the court cannot do is decide what action national security requires. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be left solely to those responsible for it.|$|E

5|$|The Raptor {{has three}} {{internal}} weapons bays: a large bay {{on the bottom}} of the fuselage, and two smaller bays on the sides of the fuselage, aft of the engine intakes. The main bay can accommodate six LAU-142/A launchers for beyond-visual-range missiles and each side bay has an LAU-141/A launcher for short-range missiles. Four of the launchers in the main bay can be replaced with two bomb racks that can each carry one 1,000lb (450kg) or four 250lb (110kg) bombs. Carrying armaments internally maintains the aircraft's stealth and minimizes additional drag. Missile launches require the bay doors to be open for less than a second, during which hydraulic arms push missiles clear of the aircraft; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> reduce vulnerability to detection and to deploy missiles during high speed flight.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{spiraling}} of {{the tool}} as it cuts, so the form {{at the bottom of}} the workpiece may be rotated with respect to the form at the top of the hole or profile. Spiraling may be undesirable because it binds the body {{of the tool}} and prevents it from cutting sharply. One solution to <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> reverse the rotation in mid cut, causing the tool to spiral in the opposite direction. If reversing the machine is not practical, then interrupting the cut is another possible solution.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} process, the Proprietors leased {{the canal}} to British Waterways in 2005. However, British Waterways had to {{withdraw}} from the scheme in 2008, due to financial difficulties, and the role of project leaders was taken over by Stroud District Council. Following the re-organisation, the Stroud Valleys Canal Company was established in March 2009. It is a limited company, with two independent directors and three directors representing Stroud District Council, the Proprietors, and the Cotswold Canals Trust. Its purpose is to hold the assets for the canals, and its charitable status means that stamp duty land tax {{does not have to be}} paid. The company will be responsible for management and maintenance of the canal once it is re-opened. The Department for Transport is in the process of reorganising how funding for major transport schemes is managed, and this has enabled Stroud District Council to submit a bid for £1.5 million to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> fund the replacement of Ocean railway culvert with a bridge. A second application for £650,000 has been made to enable part of the Thames and Severn Way long distance footpath to be created. The funding is for the section from Saul Junction to Chalford.|$|E
