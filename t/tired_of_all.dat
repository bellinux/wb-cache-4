5|$|Jon Snow, {{having just}} {{resigned}} from the Night's Watch, is disillusioned by the betrayal of his fellow Night's Watchmen and <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> of the endless fighting. Jon states his intent to head south, but Edd is unhappy with Jon's decision after seeing what had happened at Hardhome. They are interrupted by the lookout's horn as Sansa Stark, Brienne of Tarth, and Podrick Payne arrive at Castle Black and Sansa is reunited with Jon. After telling each other their stories, Sansa tries to convince Jon to help her retake Winterfell. However, Jon is still reluctant to fight. Frustrated, Sansa declares to Jon that she will take back Winterfell whether he helps her or not.|$|E
500|$|The 1922 scandalous {{story in}} the Sunday Los Angeles Times by Scanland annoyed Earp. He was <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the lies perpetuated about him and became {{determined}} to get his story accurately told. Still, in 1924, a story in a San Francisco paper said interviewing him was [...] "like pulling teeth". Earp did not trust the press and preferred to keep his mouth shut.|$|E
500|$|On December 24, 2008, Bell {{was arrested}} and charged with shoplifting, {{resisting}} arrest, and simple assault. [...] According to police, Bell was caught as he and another male attempted to steal $370 worth of clothing from Dillard's department store. [...] While being arrested, he reportedly resisted a security guard and off-duty police officer. He was released on $1,300 bond. On December 29, 2008, Bell shot himself in the chest with a [...]22-caliber pistol in a failed attempt at suicide, telling police he was <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the media attention. As the hospital in Monroe was unable to stop his internal bleeding, Bell was transferred to a hospital in Shreveport for specialist care. [...] Powell-Lexing denied that Bell had tried to kill himself, saying that the gun went off while Bell was attempting to clean it.|$|E

2500|$|Rex told me {{that even}} in 1939 Wolfe was irked by the FBI's {{consuming}} curiosity about the private business of law-abiding citizens. In consequence, Wolfe felt under no constraint {{to tell the truth}} about himself when interrogated by Stahl. There was, however, another reason for Wolfe's contradictory statements about his place of origin. Rex explained: [...] "Editors and publishers are responsible for the discrepancy. … In the original draft of Over My Dead Body Nero was a Montenegrin by birth, and it all fitted previous hints as to his background; but violent protests from The American Magazine, supported by Farrar & Rinehart, caused his cradle to be transported five thousand miles. … I got <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the yapping, and besides it seemed highly improbable that anyone would give a damn, or even, for that matter, ever notice it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{initiative}} to dramatize the novel {{was taken by}} two prop masters, Dag Alveberg and Petter Borgli. They both invested half a million Norwegian krone (NOK) in the project, financed by mortgaging their homes. Neither had any experience as producers. Alveberg stated that his main motivation was him being <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> Norwegian films being social realism. He stated that [...] "the story could have taken place, and maybe it has taken place. We all know that the Russians {{do what they want}} on Svalbard." [...] Alveberg first attempted to write the screenplay himself but was not satisfied. He presented the screenplay for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation; although they liked the project, they did not feel it was in the scope of the public broadcaster. Norway did not at the time have screenwriters of international standards, and Alveberg decided not to use his film as a training ground. He therefore hired the experienced British screenwriter Richard Harris.|$|E

2500|$|Mackintosh, like Coleridge, shines {{as one of}} {{the great}} conversationalists in an age of [...] "talkers, not of doers". Arguing cases in a Parliamentary setting, however, offers less {{immediate}} stimulation; in later years, Hazlitt claims, he has grown <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> that weight of learning, unenlivened by anything new he might have used it for in his imagination. In speaking, as in his later writing, the [...] "trim, pointed expression [...] ambitious ornaments ... ostentatious display and rapid volubility" [...] of his earlier writing are gone, leaving only the productions of a mind that works with [...] "given preconceptions." [...] His ideas [...] "do not flow naturally and gracefully from one another" [...] and [...] "have been laid down beforehand in a sort of formal division or frame-work of the understanding. ... There is no principle of fusion in the work; he strikes after the iron is cold, and there is a want of malleability in the style." ...|$|E
