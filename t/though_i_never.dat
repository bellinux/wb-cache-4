500|$|... "Don't {{fuck with}} the formula" [...] is a quote and subject of {{controversy}} {{attributed to the}} Beach Boys' lyricist and co-lead vocalist Mike Love circa 1967. Love called it the [...] "most famous thing I've ever said, even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> said it." [...] It originates from a 1971 Rolling Stone magazine article written by freelancer Tom Nolan, in which business associate David Anderle reported disagreements from within the Beach Boys' circle. According to Anderle, Love wanted the band to remain profitable for himself—"and don't fuck with the formula." [...] In the ensuing decades, the line has been repeated in myriad books, articles, websites, and blogs.|$|E
500|$|The {{mouth of}} the triptych's central figure was also {{inspired}} by the nurse's scream in film director Sergei Eisenstein's Odessa Steps massacre sequence in The Battleship Potemkin (1925). In 1984, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg confronted Bacon with a reproduction of the centre panel during the filming of a South Bank Show documentary, and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth. Bacon replied, [...] "I had always thought that I {{would be able to}} make the mouth with all the beauty of a Monet landscape <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> succeeded in doing so." [...] When Bragg asked why he thought he had failed, Bacon admitted, [...] "It should be all much more colour, should have got more of the interior of the mouth, with all the colours of the interior of the mouth, but I didn't happen to get it." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{opinion was}} split about Lazenby; {{he has been}} {{considered}} {{to have been the}} worst Bond, and has variously been described as [...] "laconic and humourless", [...] "a little stiff" [...] and [...] "annoying and smug". Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he [...] "is not a good actor and <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, there are moments when one yearns for a little of his louche panache". The New York Times critic AH Weiler also weighed in against Lazenby, saying that [...] "Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement". Pauline Kael called Lazenby [...] "quite a dull fellow" [...] in her otherwise positive review in The New Yorker. However, Peter R. Hunt, director of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, stated that Lazenby should have undertaken more films in the role, saying [...] "he would have made a very credible Bond and been very good indeed".|$|E

5000|$|In July and August 1964, however, he {{unexpectedly}} {{entered a}} new kind of dimension. In his own words, [...] "the truth of the Gospel, that until then was unknown to me, became very clear and tangible. Even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had <b>never</b> attended Church, even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had <b>never</b> studied religion, <b>I</b> found that my perspective as a secularist and agnostic had become suddenly Christian. What's more, Catholic." ...|$|R

500|$|The figure's {{mouth is}} opened wide as if screaming, an {{expression}} Bacon took from a still he kept of the nurse screaming in Sergei Eisenstein's Odessa Steps massacre sequence in his 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin. In 1984, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg asked Bacon about the still, and observed {{that in his}} earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth. Bacon replied, [...] "I had always thought that I {{would be able to}} make the mouth with all the beauty of a Monet landscape <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> succeeded in doing so." [...] When Bragg asked why he thought he had failed, Bacon said, [...] "It should be all much more colour, should have got more of the interior of the mouth, with all the colours of the interior of the mouth, but I didn't happen to get it." [...] His interest in the mouth was further stimulated by a medical textbook of diseased oral cavities bought in a second-hand bookshop, which he kept in his studio and to which he often referred.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of reviews were critical {{of either the}} film, Lazenby, or both, {{while most of the}} contemporary reviews in the British press referred to George Lazenby at some point as [...] "The Big Fry", a reference to his previous acting in [...] Fry's Chocolate [...] advertisements. Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he [...] "is not a good actor and <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, there are moments when one yearns for a little of his louche panache." [...] For all the criticism of Lazenby, however, Malcolm says that the film was [...] "quite a jolly frolic in the familiar money-spinning fashion". Tom Milne, writing in The Observer was even more scathing, saying that [...] "I... fervently trust (OHMSS) will be the last of the James Bond films. All the pleasing oddities and eccentricities and gadgets of the earlier films have somehow been lost, leaving a routine trail through which the new James Bond strides without noticeable signs of animation." ...|$|E
500|$|Chosen {{to provide}} the score for Quatermass and the Pit was Tristram Cary. He {{developed}} an interest in electronic music while serving in the Royal Navy as an electronics expert working on radar during the Second World War. He became a professional composer in 1954, working in film, theatre, radio and television, with credits including The Ladykillers (1955). He said of his assignment, “I was not mad about doing the film because Hammer wanted masses of electronic material {{and a great deal}} of orchestral music. But I had three kids, all of which were at fee-paying schools, so I needed every penny I could get!”. Cary also recalled that, “The main use of electronics in Quatermass, I think, was the violent shaking, vibrating sound that the [...] "thing in the tunnel" [...] gave off [...] It was not a terribly challenging sound to do, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> played it very loud because I didn't want to destroy my speakers – I did have hopes of destroying a few cinema loudspeaker systems, though it never happened”. Carey went on to write the score for another Hammer film, Blood from the Mummy's Tomb, in 1971. Several orchestral and electronic cues from the film were released by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{following}} years {{the role of the}} Angel was more often taken by the leading English contralto Louise Kirkby Lunn, also a celebrated Wagnerian singer (Ortrud, Kundry, Brangane and Fricka), Amneris and Dalilah, and in many ways a successor to Marie Brema, though without her range for a compelling Brünnhilde. In 1903, writing to Brema of her original performance, Elgar wrote 'I have, of course, in memory your fine and intellectual creation of the part; and <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> thought the 'tessitura' suited you well, as the magnificent artist you are, you made it go very finely.' ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the center}} of Brian's legend is his [...] "tragic genius", Carl posits, [...] "It is to pop what the tragic genius of Vincent Van Gogh is to modern art: a parable of {{sensitivity}} sacrificed to cruel indifference. ... For decades that lore has echoed through new records and retrospective box sets, countless books and essays, documentaries, TV movies, fictional accounts, ... and tribute songs". [...] The story of Brian Wilson features its own antagonist, Mike Love, {{who is known for}} his distaste of the Smile album and for urging Wilson not to [...] "fuck with the formula". Love called the quote the [...] "most famous thing I've ever said, even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> said it." [...] He wrote that it crystallized a reductive [...] "morality tale" [...] that positions Wilson as [...] "the tormented genius who was undone by his own family", a theme which appears throughout the writings of Wilson's [...] "awestruck biographers".|$|E
2500|$|Lighthouse {{design was}} the family's profession: Thomas's father (Robert's grandfather) was the famous civil {{engineer}} Robert Stevenson, {{and both of}} Thomas's brothers (Robert's uncles) Alan and David, {{were in the same}} field. Indeed, even Thomas's maternal grandfather, Thomas Smith, had been in the same profession. However, Robert's mother's family were not of the same profession. Margaret's natal family, the Balfours, were gentry, tracing their lineage back to a certain Alexander Balfour who had held the lands of Inchyra in Fife in the fifteenth century. Margaret's father, Lewis Balfour (1777–1860), was a minister of the Church of Scotland at nearby Colinton, and her siblings included the physician George William Balfour and the marine engineer James Balfour. Stevenson spent the greater part of his boyhood holidays in his maternal grandfather's house. [...] "Now I often wonder," [...] wrote Stevenson, [...] "what I inherited from this old minister. I must suppose, indeed, that he was fond of preaching sermons, and so am I, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them." ...|$|E
