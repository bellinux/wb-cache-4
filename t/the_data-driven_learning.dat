It develops an approach introduced by Tim Johns {{in the early}} 90 s, known as Data-Driven Learning (DDL, further developed in Jordan 1993; Bernardini 2000 a, 2000 b, 2002; and Sripicharn 2004, among others) and discusses some of its consequences for the achievement of learner autonomy in language learning. My discussion is based on: 1) observation of students working with corpora of electronic texts; 2) some thoughts about {{issues related to the}} development of students’ learning autonomy in interacting with the data, their peers and their teacher; and 3) reflections on the match between students’ corpus work and their achievement of ‘responsible participation’, an important issue in the development of language learning autonomy. The chapter is organised as follows: Section 2, following this introduction, summarises some features of <b>the</b> <b>Data-Driven</b> <b>Learning</b> approach; Section 3 shows that some principles found in <b>the</b> <b>Data-Driven</b> <b>Learning</b> approach are also found in discussions about the development of language learning autonomy and learners’ responsibility for their own learning; Section 4 presents two reports by students working on features of text and discourse with self-built corpora, and the students’ ‘discoveries’; Section 5 concludes and discusses the significance of these ‘discoveries’ for learner autonomy and the development of autonomous language learning...|$|E

We show how Gaussian Processes with covariance functions can be used for image super-resolution. Furthermore, considering that the training data have greatly effect on the super-resolution performance and the unsuitable training data would result in unexpected details, we adopt a data-driven scheme to learn a regression map for each query patch. There are two advantages of our approach: 1) we establish a map between the low-resolution space and the high-resolution space independent of a specified regression function; 2) <b>the</b> <b>data-driven</b> <b>learning</b> scheme improves the super-resolution performance.

Wavelets and DCT {{have been widely used}} for compression. Recently, new application of <b>the</b> <b>data-driven</b> <b>learning</b> of sparsifying dictionaries has discovered in denoising, inpainting, and compressed sensing. Here We study the sparsifying transform model related to its prior linear sparse models. Then, we formulate the problem for learning square sparsifying transforms from data. Here algorithm alternate between a sparse coding step and a transform update step. Compressed sensing (CS) utilizes the sparsity of MR images to enable reconstruction from undersampled k-space data. Recent CS methods have employed analytical sparsifying transforms such as wavelets, curvelets, and finite differences. This transform is sele cted on the basis of image type. In this thesis, we propose a framework for adaptively learning the sparsifying transform (dictionary), and reconstructing the image simultaneously from highly under sampled k-space data. This framework is enforced on overlapping image patches emphasizing local structure.

We addressed the first question by presenting CNN model enhancements in the aspects of representation, optimization, and generalization. To address the small data challenge, we showed transfer representation learning to be effective.

40|$|Abstract. It is {{well-known}} that heuristic search in ILP {{is prone to}} plateau phenomena. An explanation can be given after the work of Giordana and Saitta: the ILP covering test is NP-complete and therefore exhibits a sharp phase transition in its coverage probability. As the heuristic value of a hypothesis depends {{on the number of}} covered examples, the regions “yes ” and “no ” represent plateaus that need to be crossed during search without an informative heuristic value. Several subsequent works have extensively studied this finding by running several learning algorithms on a large set of artificially generated problems and argued that the occurrence of this phase transition dooms every learning algorithm to fail to identify the target concept. We note however that only generate-and-test learning algorithms have been applied and that this conclusion has to be qualified in <b>the</b> case of <b>data-driven</b> <b>learning</b> algorithms. Mostly building on the pioneering work of Winston on near-miss examples, we show that, on the same set of problems, a top-down datadriven strategy can cross any plateau if near-misses are supplied in the training set, whereas they do not change the plateau profile and do not guide a generate-and-test strategy. We conclude that the location of the target concept with respect to the phase transition alone is not a reliable indication of the learning problem difficulty as previously thought...|$|R
40|$|The query {{reformulation}} approach (also called semantic query optimization) {{takes advantage}} of the semantic knowledge about the contents of databases for optimization. The basic idea is to use the knowledge to reformulate a query into a less expensive yet equivalent query. Previous work on semantic query optimization has shown the cost reduction that can be achieved by reformulation, we further point out that when applied to distributed multidatabase queries, the reformulation approach can reduce the cost of moving intermediate data from one site to another. However, a robust and efficient method to discover the required knowledge has not yet been developed. This paper presents an example-guided, <b>data-driven</b> <b>learning</b> approach to acquire the knowledge needed in reformulation. We use example queries to guide the learning to capture the database usage pattern. In contrast to the heuristic-driven approach proposed by Siegel, <b>the</b> <b>data-driven</b> approach is more likely to learn the re [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} <b>the</b> {{impact of}} <b>Data-driven</b> <b>learning</b> (DDL) or classroom concordancing {{on a group}} of adolescent students in Greece seeking to investigate the degree of motivation to learn grammar when involved in DDL and the effectiveness of DDL in the teaching and learning of grammar. The study introduced concordance-based grammar materials to the experimental group, whereas a conventional grammar book was used with the control group, examining common grammar items and patterns. The analysis of classroom data gathered during DDL sessions offered insights into the improved noticing skills of the participants but also into the difficulties when involved in DDL with regard to unknown vocabulary and the Key Word in Context (KWIC) concordance format, which underlined the need for considerable teacher guidance. The qualitative evidence drawn from questionnaires and interviews suggested {{that the majority of the}} participants acknowledged the contribution and potential of corpora, but the degree of motivation to study grammar further varied. Most learners also expressed their preference for concordance-based learning, rather than their previous mostly passive learning experience, and further access to corpora, but without total abandonment of the conventional grammar book. The qualitative evidence was supplemented with analysis of test performances of the two groups, according to which more participants of the experimental group scored higher than those of the control group in each test. All these findings pointed to important gains and represent a preliminary step in the development of corpus-based grammar teaching to EFL adolescent learners...|$|R
40|$|The use of corpora in {{language}} learning is often justified {{on the basis}} that it can increase learner autonomy and lead to more successful learning, among other things. However, there has been relatively little empirical testing of such theoretical assumptions. This paper describes a simple experiment comparing a data-driven approach to more traditional alternatives. The language items are a number of English discourse markers, which are commonly taught by explanation, definition, and especially translation. However, these items often {{do not have the same}} coverage, use or register/genre as their French “equivalents”, and the results are frequently noted to be less than successful. If they are difficult to teach, might they be easier to learn? In other words, might learners be more susceptible in this case at least to a <b>data-driven</b> approach? <b>The</b> subjects here are 160 first-year students at an engineering college in France, divided into random groups to compare their learning of the target items in different situations. One group was presented with concordances; a second was given bilingual dictionary entries; the third was given monolingual information. Productive and receptive skills for the target items were tested through simple gap-fill and translation exercises using authentic language samples. A first test for knowledge extraction and retrieval was conducted in class with the tools at hand; a later test covered information retention and learning. The results provide a quantitative and qualitative insight into <b>the</b> effects of <b>data-driven</b> <b>learning</b> compared to traditional teaching...|$|R
