After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese begin to occupy the settlement, and in the ensuing chaos, Jamie is separated from his parents. Jamie's mother shouts at him over the panicked mob to wait at their house and promises that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> back for him. He spends some time living in his deserted home, but after eating all the food he ventures out into the city.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, aliens {{known as}} Mondoshawans {{arrive at an}} ancient Egyptian temple to collect, for {{safekeeping}} concerning World War I, the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil that appears every 5,000years. The weapon consists of four stones, containing the essences of the four classical elements, and a sarcophagus containing a fifth element {{in the form of}} a human, which combines the power of the other four elements into a divine light capable of defeating the evil. The Mondoshawans promise their human contact, a priest from a secret order, that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> back with the weapon in time to stop the great evil when it returns.|$|E

25|$|As Rick sits in silence, Negan drives {{back to the}} {{clearing}} and hauls Rick from the RV. Reunited with both groups, Negan explains to Rick that he hopes that the trip changed Rick's mind about him. Since Rick still refuses to submit to him, Negan forces Rick {{to his knees and}} has his son, Carl (Chandler Riggs), kneel next to him. Negan tells Rick that if he does not cut off his son's arm, he will kill every member of Rick's group and those back in Alexandria. Ricks pleads to have Negan take his life instead, but Negan refuses. Sobbing, Rick picks up the axe and is about to cut Carl when Negan stops him, happy that he has finally submitted. Negan then tells Rick and the others that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> to Alexandria in one week to take one half of their supplies. After seizing Daryl as a hostage, Negan and the Saviors leave the group in despair.|$|E
25|$|On 8 November 2016, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) {{announced}} {{the issuance of}} new 500 and 2,000 banknotes in the Mahatma Gandhi New Series of banknotes. The new 2,000 banknote has a magenta base colour, with a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi {{as well as the}} Ashoka Pillar Emblem on the front. The denomination also has a motif of the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) on the back, depicting the country's first venture into interplanetary space. The new 500 banknote has a stone grey base colour with an image of the Red Fort along with the Indian flag printed on the back. Both the banknotes also have the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan logo printed on the back. The banknote denominations of 200, 100 and 50 are also expected to be introduced in the new Mahatma Gandhi New Series, in the coming months, intended to replace all banknotes of the previous Mahatma Gandhi Series. On 13 June 2017, RBI introduced new 500 notes, but the old ones continue being legal tender. The design is similar to the current notes in the Mahatma Gandhi (New) Series, except <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> with an inset 'A'.|$|E

In writing to his American-born wife following the maneuvers, Admiral Beatty noted that, [...] "The American Squadron enjoyed themselves greatly while we were out, and did well, and will do better next time.

500|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} films, the plot was criticized as incoherent and confusing. The Arizona Republic critic Bill Goodykoontz rated the film two out of five, stating that [...] "the movie {{is a series of}} distractions tossed together in the hopes that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> together in a coherent story. That never really happens." [...] Online reviewer James Berardinelli considered the script [...] "little more than a clothesline from which to dangle all of the obligatory set pieces", and USA Todays Claudia Puig found On Stranger Tides [...] "familiar and predictable...often incoherent and crammed with pointless details." ...|$|E

He only acknowledged the Syrian civil war as true popular revolution and hinted that GCC troops may get involved there. [...] "If Iran's mercenaries are not defeated in Syria, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> {{to us in the}} Gulf," [...] he added. In a March 2012 interview, al-Mushīr accused the U.S. of secretly supporting the Bahraini opposition and [...] "sow discord among the Gulf states". He protested the U.S. halting their supply of crowd-control weapons by denying U.S. aircraft basing access. The move was described by Wehrey as [...] "effectively overruling the king".|$|E

Like other species of kiwi, {{they have a good}} sense of smell, which is unusual in birds. Males are {{fiercely}} territorial. At most, four to five kiwis live in a square kilometre. One pair's territory can be [...] in size. It is not known how they defend such a large territory in proportion to their size. They will call, chase, or fight intruders out. Vocalisations of the great spotted kiwi include growls, hisses, and bill snapping. Great spotted kiwi males have a call that resembles a warbling whistle, while the female call is harsh raspy, and also warbling.|$|E

Later, Anna is shown telling their son of Artyom's bravery. In the [...] "good" [...] ending, later revealed as the canonical ending, Artyom prepares to destroy the bunker but is stopped by the little Dark One, who, along with the awakened Dark Ones, defeats Korbut's army. Artyom calls the little Dark One humanity's [...] "last light of hope". In both endings, the young Dark One leaves with the surviving Dark Ones to find safety, while promising that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> back in the future to help rebuild the world.|$|E

500|$|Due {{to being}} vivified electricity, Cole {{is unable to}} use vehicles, take up weapons, or swim. Cole easily climbs {{buildings}} and other structures and can fall a great height without taking damage. Many powers are acquired {{over the course of}} the game; once acquired the player can use experience points, awarded for specific actions, stunts and missions, to increase the power's effectiveness. The growth of these powers is affected by Cole's current Karma level. Starting in a neutral position, it ranges from Guardian to Champion to Hero on the Good side, [...] and from Thug to Outlaw to Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as stopping to help injured citizens or draining their health to restore Cole's, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma Moments, when the action pauses and the player is told, through a monologue by Cole, of two actions that can be taken, always a good and bad option. For example, one scenario the player is presented with is to either pull a valve and get a spray of tar in his face (Good), or force a civilian to do it for him (Evil). There are also a number of paired Good/Evil side missions in the game; completing one will lock out the other mission but will reward the player with a large amount of Karma towards their selected Karma goal. Completion of these missions helps gain access to unique super powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Doing so will lock out any purchased power(s) in the original chosen Karma sector. In addition to altering Cole's appearance and certain aspects of the game's story, Karma also influences the behavior of the citizens of Empire City, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> to help Cole in battle if his Karma is Good, but will turn on Cole and throw rocks at him if he has Bad Karma.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] many {{traditional}} Jewish communities {{it is the}} custom for congregants to spread their tallitot over their own heads during the blessing and {{not look at the}} Kohanim. If a man has children, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> under his tallit to be blessed, even if they are quite old. The (unattributed) basis of this custom is to emphasize the spiritual aspect of the blessing over the role of the Kohanim themselves; as per the scriptural verse, the Kohanim are simply a vehicle for the expression of the blessing, when they [...] "place My name upon the children of Israel".|$|E

2500|$|Eastern Orthodoxy {{treats the}} text as {{simultaneously}} describing contemporaneous events (events occurring at the same time) and as prophecy of events to come, for which the contemporaneous events were a form of foreshadow. It rejects attempts to determine, before the fact, if the events of Revelation are occurring by mapping them onto present-day events, taking to heart the Scriptural warning against those who proclaim [...] "He is here!" [...] prematurely. Instead, the book {{is seen as a}} warning to be spiritually and morally ready for the end times, whenever they may come ("as a thief in the night"), but <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> at the time of God's choosing, not something that can be precipitated nor trivially deduced by mortals.
