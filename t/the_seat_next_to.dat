25|$|Election to the United States House of Representatives came in 1888 {{when he won}} {{the race}} to {{represent}} Wisconsin's 9th congressional district. His service in the Congress was largely undistinguished but the friends he made there were influential to his future career. Chief among his new friends was William McKinley who was assigned to <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> McCord. Attempts by McCord to win reelection in 1890 and 1892 were unsuccessful. During this time period, McCord experienced a serious financial set back that resulted in him declaring bankruptcy.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the chief}} villain, Hugo Drax, {{was to be}} played by British actor James Mason, but once the {{decision}} was made that the film would be an Anglo-French co-production under the 1965–79 film treaty, French actor Michael Lonsdale was cast as Drax and Corinne Cléry was chosen for the part of Corinne Dufour, to comply with qualifying criteria of the agreement. Stewart Granger [...] and Louis Jourdan was considered also for the role of Drax. [...] Jourdan later portrayed prince Kamal Khan, chief villain of Octopussy. American actress Lois Chiles had originally been offered the role of Anya Amasova in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), but had turned down the part when she decided to take temporary retirement. Chiles was cast as Holly Goodhead by chance, when she was given <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Lewis Gilbert on a flight and he believed she would be ideal for the role as the CIA scientist.|$|E
500|$|In June 1941, LeHand {{collapsed}} at a White House {{dinner party}} {{and two weeks}} later suffered a major stroke that left her partially paralyzed with little speech function. Goodwin says a factor that {{may have led to}} her illness was stress stemming from fears that the exiled Princess Märtha of Sweden, a Washington-area resident during World War II, had replaced her as FDR's favorite companion, occupying <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him that had long been LeHand's in automobile rides. Kathryn Smith cites the stress of the world crisis that spring, as Britain stood alone against the Nazis, and the ill health of FDR, who had expected her to be at his bedside for weeks on end. [...] She had also become critical of FDR's leadership {{for the first time that}} spring, sharing her disappointment with Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes, a close friend. FDR paid LeHand's medical bills and later made provisions for her in his will, stating that half the income of his estate would go to Eleanor and half to [...] "my friend Marguerite A. LeHand...for medical attention, care and treatment during her lifetime." [...] He also sent her to Warm Springs, where he hoped she could recover with the help of the physical therapy staff there. She was very unhappy in Warm Springs and may have tried to kill herself by eating chicken bones during the 1941 Christmas season. In early 1942, she spent some weeks in her old room at the White House, but quickly deteriorated due to her frustrations at not being able to help. After an incident in which she set the bed on fire—probably while smoking—it was agreed that LeHand would return to her sister's home in Somerville, Massachusetts, and she departed from Washington on May 15, 1942.|$|E

2500|$|Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave it 3 stars out of5, and {{commented that}} the [...] "irreverently funny" [...] film had [...] "a vibe so casual you half expect star Seth Rogen to amble off screen and put his feet up on <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> you," [...] and praising {{director}} Gondry's [...] "sense of humor and acute visual skill" [...] even while calling the movie [...] "cheerfully unfocused". Rogen proclaimed the film was a [...] "nightmare", chalking it up to studio executives paying {{little attention to the}} most expensive portions of the film and its inflated budget.|$|E
2500|$|Liz is {{generally}} portrayed {{as something of}} a [...] "geek". So, while she is an apparently skilled writer, she seems to have very few social skills (in [...] "Rosemary's Baby", Jack describes her as [...] "socially retarded"). For example, while she was trying to pick up men at a karaoke bar, a man asked her if <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her was taken, leading her to ask him why she should have to move her coat just so he could sit there. Liz is often shown to be generally insecure and holds a strong concern for how she is perceived by others. Liz is sometimes dismissive of others, a personality flaw that can be connected to her lack of social skills. Assessing Liz's personality up to near the end of season 3, Jonah Weinerslav described her as [...] "an eternal 13-year-old tomboy—scared of sex, obsessed with Star Wars and meatball subs" [...] and as [...] "cling to a fantasy of presexual, junk-food-munching adolescence".|$|E

60|$|Dinner {{was soon}} announced, and I had the honour of leading in Miss B., who looked back rather angrily, I thought, at Captain Fizgig, because that gentleman had offered {{his arm to}} Mrs. Brough.

60|$|Margaret made no answer, {{and then}} she and her cousin started on foot across the grounds to the station.

It happened {{that there was no}} passenger in either of <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him or her, so that there was ample opportunity for them to hold a private conversation; but Mr Ball said nothing to her, and she, not knowing how to begin, said nothing to him.

60|$|We {{had been}} there perhaps half an hour when I saw a sudden change in his demeanor, which was almost at once {{reflected}} in the serious expression that had stolen into Mr. Parker's benign countenance. An old gentleman, white-haired, with rubicund face and a jovial air, had taken <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> them. He had the appearance of having come from the country and of having spent a happy day in town. Even from where I sat I could see protruding from his breast-pocket a brown leather pocketbook.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Merrill took <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her and {{continued}} to talk, scattering his pleasantries equally among the three, patting her arm when her own turn came. She liked Mr. Merrill very much; he seemed to her (as, indeed, he was) honest and kind-hearted. Cynthia was not lacking in a proper appreciation of herself--that may have been discovered. But she was puzzled to know why this gentleman should {{make it a point}} to pay such particular attention to a young country girl. Other railroad presidents whom she could name had not done so. She was thinking of these things, rather than listening to Mr. Merrill's conversation, when the sound of Mr. Worthington's name startled her.|$|E
60|$|In all {{his days}} Hare {{had never seen}} such a {{bountiful}} board. Yet he was unable to appreciate it, to share in the general thanksgiving. Dominating all other feeling was the fear that Mescal would come in and take a seat by Snap Naab's side. When Snap seated himself opposite with his pale little wife Hare found himself waiting for Mescal with an intensity that made him dead to all else. The girls, Judith, Esther, Rebecca, came running gayly in, clad in their best dresses, with bright ribbons to honor the occasion. Rebecca took the seat beside Snap, and Hare gulped with a hard contraction of his throat. Mescal was not yet a Mormon's wife! He seemed to be lifted upward, to grow light-headed with the blessed assurance. Then Mescal entered and took <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him. She smiled and spoke, and the blood beat thick in his ears.|$|E

60|$|These {{roads were}} for the coaches. Young folks, who never saw {{anything}} nearer approaching to a stage coach than the drags some gentlemen keep, can hardly fancy what these stage coaches were--tall vehicles, holding four inside passengers and at least twelve outside and quantities of luggage. They were drawn by four of the strongest and quickest horses that could be procured, and these were changed about every five or six miles, so as to keep up full speed. The coachman, generally a big, burly man, with a face reddened by exposure to the weather, and often by a glass of ale at every stage, sat on the box in a drab coat, with many capes one over the other. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him was the favourite one with the passengers, and gentlemen would sometimes bribe coachmen to let them drive; nay, some gentlemen actually took to the trade themselves. There was also a guard, who in mail coaches {{took care of the}} post bags, and dropped them at the places where they were intended for. In the days when highwaymen infested the roads the guard had carried pistols, and still the guard of the mail wore a red coat, and blew a horn on entering any place to warn the people to bring out their post bags and exchange them for others.|$|E
60|$|That unfortunate young man, Lord Nidderdale, {{occupied}} <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> that {{on which}} Melmotte had placed himself. It had so happened {{three or four}} times since Melmotte had been in the House, as the young lord, fully intending to marry the Financier's daughter, had resolved {{that he would not be}} ashamed of his father-in-law. He understood that countenance of the sort which he as a young aristocrat could give to the man of millions who had risen no one knew whence, was part of the bargain in reference to the marriage, and he was gifted with a mingled honesty and courage which together made him willing and able to carry out his idea. He had given Melmotte little lessons as to ordinary forms of the House, and had done what in him lay to earn the money which was to be forthcoming. But it had become manifest both to him and to his father during the last two days,--very painfully manifest to his father,--that the thing must be abandoned. And if so,--then why should he be any longer gracious to Melmotte? And, moreover, though he had been ready to be courteous to a very vulgar and a very disagreeable man, he was not anxious to extend his civilities to one who, as he was now assured, had been certainly guilty of forgery. But to get up at once and leave his seat because Melmotte had placed himself by his side, did not suit the turn of his mind. He looked round to his neighbour on the right with a half-comic look of misery, and then prepared himself to bear his punishment, whatever it might be.|$|E
6000|$|Places of honour {{had been}} kept for the Miss Lammeters near {{the head of the}} {{principal}} tea-table in the wainscoted parlour, now looking fresh and pleasant with handsome branches of holly, yew, and laurel, from the abundant growths of the old garden; and Nancy felt an inward flutter, that no firmness of purpose could prevent, when she saw Mr. Godfrey Cass advancing to lead her to a seat between himself and Mr. Crackenthorp, while Priscilla was called to the opposite side between her father and the Squire. It certainly did make some difference to Nancy that the lover she had given up was the young man of quite the highest consequence in the parish--at home in a venerable and unique parlour, which was the extremity of grandeur in her experience, a parlour where she might one day have been mistress, with the consciousness that she was spoken of as [...] "Madam Cass", the Squire's wife. These circumstances exalted her inward drama in her own eyes, and deepened the emphasis with which she declared to herself that not the most dazzling rank should induce her to marry a man whose conduct showed him careless of his character, but that, [...] "love once, love always", was the motto of a true and pure woman, and no man should ever have any right over her which would be a call on her to destroy the dried flowers that she treasured, and always would treasure, for Godfrey Cass's sake. And Nancy was capable of keeping her word to herself under very trying conditions. Nothing but a becoming blush betrayed the moving thoughts that urged themselves upon her as she accepted <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Crackenthorp; for she was so instinctively neat and adroit in all her actions, and her pretty lips met each other with such quiet firmness, {{that it would have been}} difficult for her to appear agitated.|$|E
