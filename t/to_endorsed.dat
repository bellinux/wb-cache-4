40|$|Advertisers {{increasingly}} motivate people <b>to</b> <b>endorse</b> brands as {{a tactic}} to overcome people’s resistance against traditional persuasion attempts. In {{the present paper}} we introduce the concept of consumer endorsement, which we define as people’s intentional public and positive affiliations with brands. Little is known yet about why people are willing <b>to</b> <b>endorse</b> brands. Therefore, we conducted an experiment to examine factors that affect people’s decisions <b>to</b> <b>endorse</b> brands. Suggesting that people strive to express their identities by publicly endorsing brands, we investigated to what extent brand symbolism and the public (vs. private) nature of an endorsement affected people’s intentions <b>to</b> <b>endorse,</b> and explored whether these effects differed between for-profit and nonprofit brands. Results indicate that people prefer to publicly affiliate with nonprofit brands, but prefer private affiliation with for-profit brands. Higher levels of brand symbolism enhanced people’s intention <b>to</b> <b>endorse</b> for-profit brands but not nonprofit brands...|$|R

50|$|South Barwon {{was created}} in 1976 as a {{predominantly}} rural seat which was considered safe for the conservative Liberal Party of Australia. It was won by Liberal Aurel Smith, formerly the member for Bellarine, upon its inception, and retained for the party by Harley Dickinson upon Smith's retirement in 1982. Dickinson held the seat until 1992, when he quit the party and attempted to retain the seat as an independent, but lost <b>to</b> <b>endorsed</b> Liberal candidate and former television newsreader Alister Paterson. The seat underwent significant demographic change during Paterson's tenure as successive redistributions pushed it further into Geelong. Major population growth in the traditionally Labor-voting areas of Torquay, Barwon Heads and southern Geelong, caused the seat to become progressively less safe for the Liberal Party. These changes {{came to a head}} at the 2002 election, when the Australian Labor Party. nominated former Geelong mayor Michael Crutchfield as its candidate, and amidst a statewide landslide victory, succeeded in taking South Barwon {{for the first time in}} its history. Crutchfield was re-elected in 2006, but lost in 2010 to local councillor and Liberal candidate Andrew Katos.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of social networking platforms are giving users the option to endorse entities that they find appealing, such as videos, photos, or even other users. We define this model as a Social Endorsement Network, visualized as a bipartite graph with edges (endorsements) from users <b>to</b> <b>endorsed</b> entities. In this work, we formalize the problem of interactive recommendations in social endorsement networks: given a query of tags and a social endorsement network, the problem is to recommend entities that match the query and also share {{a significant number of}} common endorsers. We propose an efficient search engine for the solution of the problem, able to produce high-quality and explainable recommendations. The entire framework is designed in a principled and efficient manner, making it ideal for large-scale systems. In a thorough experimental evaluation on real datasets, we illustrate the efficacy of our methods and provide some valuable insight on social endorsement networks...|$|E

40|$|This study {{addressed}} the inherent quandary of misconceptions that impacts on performance {{as reported in}} the National Diagnostic Report of the learner performance in the National Senior Certificate (NSC) 2011 examinations. In order to gain insights into learner performance, Sfard’s (2008) commognitive framework was used as a theoretical lens to examine learners’ mathematical thinking about functions. This study first described components of function concept from a constructivist perspective and further redescribed these in discursive terms i. e. from a focus on learners’ use of terminology to words/word use; from representations to visual mediators; from competencies to routines; and from concept definition <b>to</b> <b>endorsed</b> narratives. Data was collected through written tests and interviews of Grade 11 learners in one of the multilingual schools in one Province in South Africa. The research approach was first quantitative. Twenty six learners were given tasks involving functions that would highlight their errors. The study then moved to an interpretive qualitative approach based on Sfard’s commognitive theory. The qualitative study had five participants. A multiple methods strategy of data collection was employed during this stage: learners’ interview transcripts, written work and researcher’s field notes. The quantitative study confirms that learners were making errors on functions. The analysis of the qualitative study revealed that learners’ discourse included a combination of colloquial and mathematical discourse as expected. Interestingly, while all the features of mathematical discourse were present in learners’ mathematical discourse, their routines and words were linked to errors...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{importance}} of distress identification and management in oncology has been established. We {{examined the relationship}} between distress and unmet bio-psychosocial needs, applying advanced statistical techniques, to identify which needs have the closest relationship to distress. Methods: Oncology outpatients (n = 1066) undergoing QUICATOUCH screening in an Australian cancer centre completed the distress thermometer (DT) and problem list (PL). Principal component analysis (PCA), logistic regression and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses tested the relationship between DT score (at a cut-off point of 4) and PL items. Results: Sixteen items were reported by < 5 % of participants. PCA analysis identified four major components. Logistic regression analysis indicated three of these component scores, and four individual items (20 items in total) demonstrated a significant independent relationship with distress. The best CART model contained only two PL items: 'worry' and 'depression'. Conclusions: The DT and PL function as intended, quantifying negative emotional experience (distress) and identifying bio-psychosocial sources of distress. We offer two suggestions to minimise PL response time whilst targeting PL items most related to distress, thereby increasing clinical utility. To identify patients who might require specialised psychological services, we suggest the DT followed by a short, case-finding instrument for patients over threshold on the DT. To identify other important sources of distress, we suggest using a modified PL of 14 key items, with the 15 th item 'any other problem' as a simple safety net question. Shorter times for patient completion and clinician response <b>to</b> <b>endorsed</b> PL items will maximise acceptance and clinical utility...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Master of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. These studies examined the relative contributions of perceived childrearing practices with parents, adult attachment styles, endorsed cultural values to self-construals. The findings were verified by cross-examination {{in terms of both}} correlational and experimental designs, concepts being measured by more than one scale and method, two sources of data (self-report and friend-report), and two groups of sample (university students and married adults). Results showed that interdependent self-construal was significantly and positively predicted by endorsed collectivism cultural value but negatively predicted by endorsed individualism cultural value, whereas independent self-construal was unexpectedly positively predicted by endorsed collectivism cultural value. Endorsed collectivism cultural value in turn was significantly and positively predicted by secure attachment style, attachment close, and attachment anxiety, whilst endorsed individualism cultural value was significantly and positively predicted by dismissing attachment style. In addition <b>to</b> <b>endorsed</b> cultural values, independent self-construal was also predicted by secure attachment style whilst interdependent self-construal was predicted by both attachment close and attachment anxiety. The self-construal task showed no relationship between attachment security and the qualitative self-construal. In reference to the mediation function, endorsed collectivism cultural value partially mediated the link between secure attachment style and independent self-construal, and endorsed cultural value completely mediated the link between attachment anxiety and interdependent self-construal and the link between attachment close and interdependent self-construal. Across three studies, independent self-construal and interdependent self-construal were moderately to highly positive correlated, which were supposed to be two orthogonal dimensions in Singelis (1994). Attachment distributions varied in terms of the different attachment scales. Findings are discussed in terms of the complexity of the self-construal concept and the possible association between adult attachment styles and cultural values...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} is the Accepted Manuscript {{version of a}} published work that appeared in final form in Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps. To access the final edited and published work see [URL] stress disorder (PTSD) is a disabling trauma and stress-related disorder that may occur after a person experiences a traumatic event, and evokes a combination of intrusion and avoidance symptoms, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity. Accelerated resolution therapy (ART) is an emerging psychotherapy that provides fast and lasting resolution for mental health problems such as PTSD. ART {{has been shown to}} achieve a positive result in one to five sessions, typically over a 2 -week period, and requires no homework, skills practice or repeated exposure to targeted events. Initial research, including one randomised control trial, has demonstrated that ART interventions can significantly reduce symptoms of psychological trauma in both civilians and US service members and veterans. These results suggest that ART be considered as either a primary treatment option or for refractory PTSD in those with a suboptimal response <b>to</b> <b>endorsed</b> first-line therapies. Conservative estimates indicate substantial potential cost savings in PTSD treatment. Despite the need for more definitive clinical trials, there is increasing interest in ART in the USA, including in the US Army. The growing positive empirical evidence is compelling, and there appears to be sufficient evidence to warrant UK researchers undertaking ART research. The armed forces offer the potential for comparative international trials. However, equally important are veterans, emergency services personnel and those subjected to violence. ART appears to also have application in other conditions, including depression, anxiety disorders, and alcohol or drug misuse. ART can potentially help personnel traumatised by the unique challenges of war and conflict zones by providing brief psychotherapy in a readily accessible and culturally competent manner. ART facilitates the provision of interventions and resolutions in theatre, thus enhancing forces’ fighting capability...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Celebrities {{can have}} {{substantial}} influence as medical advisors. However, {{their impact on}} public health is equivocal: depending on the advice’s validity and applicability, celebrity engagements can benefit or hinder efforts to educate patients on evidence-based practices and improve their health literacy. This meta-narrative analysis synthesizes multiple disciplinary insights explaining the influence celebrities have on people’s health-related behaviors. Methods Systematic searches of electronic databases BusinessSource Complete, Communication & Mass Media Complete, Humanities Abstracts, ProQuest Political Science, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Sociology Abstracts were conducted. Retrieved articles were used to inform a conceptual analysis of the possible processes accounting for the substantial influence celebrities may have as medical advisors. Results Fourteen mechanisms of celebrity influence were identified. According to the economics literature, celebrities distinguish endorsed items from competitors and can catalyze herd behavior. Marketing studies tell us that celebrities’ characteristics are transferred <b>to</b> <b>endorsed</b> products, and that the most successful celebrity advisors are those viewed as credible, a perception they can create with their success. Neuroscience research supports these explanations, finding that celebrity endorsements activate brain regions involved in making positive associations, building trust and encoding memories. The psychology literature tells us that celebrity advice conditions people to react positively toward it. People are also inclined to follow celebrities if the advice matches their self-conceptions or if not following it would generate cognitive dissonance. Sociology explains how celebrities’ advice spreads through social networks, how their influence is a manifestation of people’s desire to acquire celebrities’ social capital, and how they affect the ways people acquire and interpret health information. Conclusion There are clear and deeply rooted biological, psychological and social processes that explain how celebrities influence people’s health behaviors. With {{a better understanding of}} this phenomenon, medical professionals can work to ensure that it is harnessed for good rather than abused for harm. Physicians can discuss with their patients the validity of celebrity advice and share more credible sources of health information. Public health practitioners can debunk celebrities offering unsubstantiated advice or receiving inappropriate financial compensation, and should collaborate with well-meaning celebrities, leveraging their influence to disseminate medical practices of demonstrated benefit...|$|E
