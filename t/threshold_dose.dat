40|$|Abstract. A long-standing {{distinction}} {{has been}} made between “stochastic ” and “deterministic ” radiation effects. The terms “stochastic ” (“random”) and “deterministic ” (“inevitable”) were coined mainly because of epidemiological results and are sometimes mis-leading. There have been suggestions to replace these terms by other ones (e. g. “haplocytic ” instead of “stochastic ” and “polycytic ” or “tissue effects ” instead of “deterministic”), but, so far, none of these alternatives succeeded in being broadly accepted. In radiation protection the distinction is important, because {{in the case of}} deterministic effects, we are sure that <b>threshold</b> <b>doses</b> exist that must be exceeded, before an effect can be detected, whereas in the case of stochastic effects (tumours and hereditary effects), it is assumed that either no threshold is present at all, or that it is in a very low dose range. Recently, some “established ” results have been questioned. This is particularly true for cataracts and cardiovascular diseases. In both cases, it seems to be very probable that the previously assumed <b>threshold</b> <b>doses</b> are too high. If it turns out that this is indeed the case, quite some re-thinking will be required in radiation protection...|$|R
50|$|One low-dose {{study found}} no effect of Cymbopogon citratus {{essential}} oils on humans. However, subsequent {{research has demonstrated}} that the plants essential oil enhances GABA-ergic neurotranssmision at sufficient doses (with an anxiolytic <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> of 10 mg/kg) via positive allosteric agonism {{in the same manner as}} benzodiazepines (ex. diazepam) which are used clinically as anxiolytics, sedative/hypnotics, muscle relaxants, and anticonvulsants. Despite the observed pharmacological activity, the average adult male would require 600-800 mg of the pure essential oil to achieve a clinically significant reduction in anxiety. Most commercial supplements contain doses far below the <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> which suggests that the majority of lemongrass supplements exert their anxiolytic benefits either primarily or entirely through the induction of the placebo effect. As the essential oil was demonstrated to act synergistically with other GABA-ergics (even in sub-therapeutic doses) and likely also potentiates anxiolytics of other mechanisms (as predicted by the mechanics of benzodiazepines), the possibility of pharmacologically-induced anxiolysis cannot be eliminated when formulations containing a sub-therapeutic lemongrass dosage also contain other anxiolytic herbs/chemicals.|$|E

40|$|Although it {{has been}} {{reported}} that fluorescent quantum dots (QDs) have obvious acute toxic effects in vitro, their toxic effects at low <b>doses</b> or <b>threshold</b> <b>doses</b> are still unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the biological histocompatibility and in vitro toxicity of three types of QDs at <b>threshold</b> <b>doses.</b> Also, we compared the toxic effects of QDs with different raw chemical compositions and sizes. The results showed that low concentrations of QDs (≤ 7 μg/mL) had no obvious effect on cell viability and cell membrane damage, oxidative damage, cell apoptosis or DNA damage. However, QD exposure led to a significant cytotoxicity at higher doses (≥ 14 μg/mL) and induced abnormal cellular morphology. In addition, when comparing the three types of QDs, 2. 2 nm CdTe QDs exposure showed a significantly increased proportion of apoptotic cells and significant DNA damage, suggesting that size and composition contribute to the toxic effects of QDs. Based on these discussions, it was concluded that the concentration (7 μg/mL) may serve as a threshold level for these three types of QDs only in L 929 fibroblasts, whereas high concentrations (above 14 μg/mL) may be toxic, resulting in inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis and DNA damage in L 929 fibroblasts...|$|R

Trunk blood, serum, cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum, brain stem, fat and muscle tissues obtained at criterion {{were used to determine}} ethanol (blood) and pregnanolone. Ethanol reduced <b>threshold</b> <b>doses</b> in a dose dependent linear manner. A similar reduction of pregnanolone tissue concentrations was only found in brain stem and striatum. Deviations consisted of larger decreases in serum, cerebellum and hippocampus after 0. 5 [*]g[*]kg− 1 ethanol and in cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus after 2. 0 [*]g[*]kg− 1 of ethanol. Positive correlations between dose and concentration of pregnanolone was recorded in brain stem, hippocampus, cerebellum and cortex. A kinetic component influenced the concentration in cortex. There was a correlation between dose and serum concentration of pregnanolone only after ethanol. In the muscle 0. 5 [*]g[*]kg− 1 ethanol had no influence on pregnanolone concentration. The linear, additive pharmacodynamic interaction could involve the GABA ionophore. A pharmacokinetic interaction was found in cortex. The retained high uptake of pregnanolone in muscle (after 0. 5 [*]g[*]kg− 1) corresponded to losses in other tissues (including serum).

40|$|Stem cell doses {{necessary}} for engraftment after myeloablative therapy as defined for fresh transplants vary largely. Loss of CD 34 (+) cell quality after cryopreservation {{might contribute to}} this variation. With a new early apoptosis assay including the vital stain Syto 16, together with the permeability marker 7 -AAD, CD 34 (+) cell viability in leucapheresis samples of 49 lymphoma patients receiving a BEAM regimen was analysed. After freeze-thawing large numbers of non-viable, early apoptotic cells appeared, leading to only 42 % viability compared to 72 % using 7 -AAD only. Based on this Sytol. 6 staining in the frozen-thawed grafts, threshold numbers for adequate haematological recovery of 2. 8 - 3. 0 x 106 CD 34 (+) cells/kg body weight determined for fresh grafts, now decreased to 1. 2 - 1. 3 X 10 (6) CD 34 (+) cells/kg. In whole blood transplantation of lymphoma patients (n = 45) receiving a BEAM-like regimen, low doses of CD 34 (+) cells were sufficient for recovery (0. 3 - 0. 4 X 10 (6) CD 34 (+) cells/kg). In contrast to freeze-thawing of leucapheresis material, a high viability of CD 34 (+) cells was preserved during storage for 3 days at 4 degreesC, leaving <b>threshold</b> <b>doses</b> for recovery unchanged. In conclusion, the Syto 16 assay reveals the presence of many more non-functional stem cells in frozen-thawed transplants than presumed thus far.
